INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\nA. **The Parties**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe claimant in these proceedings is Hela Schwarz GmbH (\"**Hela Schwarz**\" or \"**Claimant**\"), a company established under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Claimant is represented in these proceedings by Dr. Philipp K. Wagner, Dr. Florian Dupuy, Dr. Joseph Schwartz and Dr. Felix Krumbiegel of Wagner Arbitration in Berlin.\n\n2.\n\nThe respondent is the People\u2019s Republic of China (the \"**PRC**\" or \"**Respondent**\"). The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by Ms. Yongjie Li, Mr. Chenghua Jiang, Mr. Youyou Wang and Mr. Zhao Sun of the Department of Treaty and Law of the Ministry of Commerce; Prof. Emmanuel Gaillard, Dr. Nils Eliasson, Mr. Emmanuel Jacomy and Mr. Jeremy Sharpe of Shearman & Sterling LLP; and Mr. Xiusong Xing, Mr. Xin Zhang, and Mr. Qing Ren of Global Law Office in Beijing.\n\n**B. Submission of the Dispute to Arbitration**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThis dispute has been submitted to arbitration on the basis of (a) the Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"**BIT**\") and Protocol, dated 1 December 2003, and (b) the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").1\n\nRequest for Arbitration (\"RfA\"), \u00b6\u00b6 1, 20 *et seq.*\n\n**C. The Issue Addressed in the Procedural Order**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThis Procedural Order addresses the Claimant\u2019s Urgent Request for Provisional Measures dated 4 December 2017 (\"**PM Request**\"), which was submitted before the Tribunal was constituted. The Respondent opposes the Claimant\u2019s PM Request.\n\n5.\n\nAs is set out more fully below, pursuant to a pleading schedule set by the ICSID Secretary-General, the Parties submitted the following written pleadings on the subject of the Claimant\u2019s PM Request: the Respondent\u2019s Observations on the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures dated 13 December 2017 (\"**Observations**\"); the Claimant\u2019s Reply to the Respondent\u2019s Observations on Provisional Measures dated 18 December 2017 (\"**Reply**\"); and the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder to the Claimant\u2019s Reply on Provisional Measures dated 22 December 2017 (\"**Rejoinder**\"). These written submissions were supplemented by correspondence from the Parties and brief oral submissions by the Parties on provisional measures during the course of the first session on 1 February 2018.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal has given careful consideration to the submissions of the Parties on the Claimant\u2019s PM Request. For reasons that will become apparent, developments on the ground following the submission of the PM Request materially changed the circumstances pertaining to the Request. In light of, *inter alia*, these changed circumstances, the Tribunal has concluded that the Claimant\u2019s PM Request must be denied. The Tribunal\u2019s decision denying the PM Request, including the reasons therefore set out in summary form, was communicated to the Parties by correspondence from the Secretary of the Tribunal dated 10 April 2018. This Procedural Order reflects the operative parts of that correspondence and constitutes the fully reasoned and elaborated Decision of the Tribunal denying the Claimant\u2019s PM Request.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n-----------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn 2 May 2017, the Claimant filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID (\"**Request for Arbitration**\"). On 4 May 2017, the ICSID Secretariat sent the Claimant a list of questions relating to the Request for Arbitration.\n\n8.\n\nOn 9 May 2017, the Claimant\u2019s then counsel, Dentons LLP in Beijing, informed ICSID that it had withdrawn and would no longer represent Claimant in this matter. Two months later, on 6 June 2017, Dr. Florian Dupuy and Dr. Joseph Schwartz informed ICSID that the Claimant had retained their firm, Wagner Arbitration, to represent it in this proceeding. They also provided the corresponding power of attorney.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of 19 June 2017, the Claimant provided its responses to the Secretariat\u2019s questions of 4 May 2017. On 21 June 2017, the Respondent offered comments on the Claimant\u2019s responses.\n\n10.\n\nLater on 21 June 2017, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the Request for Arbitration and notified the Parties.\n\n11.\n\nThe Parties subsequently agreed on a method of constituting the Tribunal pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. In accordance with this method, the Claimant appointed Mr. Roland Ziad\u00e9 (French/Lebanese/Ecuadorian) as arbitrator. He accepted his appointment on 27 September 2017. The Respondent thereafter appointed Professor Campbell McLachlan (New Zealand) as arbitrator. He accepted his appointment on 27 October 2017.\n\n12.\n\nOn 16 November 2017, the Claimant informed ICSID that the Parties had been unable to agree on the presiding arbitrator and requested, pursuant to the Parties\u2019 agreement, that the Secretary-General make the appointment. The Parties further agreed that the Secretary-General would conduct a ballot process for the appointment of the President, failing which the Secretary-General would make the appointment directly. ICSID provided the Parties will a ballot of candidates on 1 December 2017.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter of 1 December 2017, the Claimant informed the Respondent that the People\u2019s Government of Jinan Municipality (\"**Jinan Municipal Government**\") had issued a public announcement the day before ordering the Claimant\u2019s local subsidiary to evacuate its buildings within five days, and indicating that the buildings would be demolished. The Claimant asked the Respondent to instruct the local authorities not to demolish the company\u2019s buildings pending this arbitration and reserved its right to file an application for provisional measures and a temporary restraining order.\n\n14.\n\nThe Claimant wrote to the Respondent again on 4 December 2017, expressing concern that the local authorities appeared to be acting upon the Respondent\u2019s direct instructions. The Claimant requested that the Respondent take immediate action to intervene and prevent further escalation.\n\n15.\n\nAlso on 4 December 2017, the Claimant submitted the PM Request, together with Exhibits C-9 to C-15. ICSID acknowledged receipt of the PM Request on the same day, stating:\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(2), the Tribunal, once constituted, will give priority to the consideration of the [PM Request]. In this regard, ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(5) provides that either Party may request the Secretary-General to fix time limits for the Parties to present observations on the [PM Request], so that the [PM Request] and observations may be considered by the Tribunal promptly upon its constitution. We ask the Claimant to confirm whether it makes such a request.\n\n16.\n\nLater on 4 December 2017, the Respondent responded to the Claimant\u2019s correspondence of 1 and 4 December 2017. The Respondent rejected the Claimant\u2019s allegations and stated that it was not in a position to accede to the Claimant\u2019s request for intervention.\n\n17.\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the Respondent wrote to ICSID to object to certain of the Claimant\u2019s requests contained in the PM Request. In particular, the Respondent noted that provisional measures could not be ordered until the Tribunal was properly constituted.\n\n18.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimant wrote to ICSID to confirm that it was requesting the Secretary-General to fix time limits for the Respondent to present its observations on the PM Request. The Claimant further requested that a preliminary decision on the PM Request be made even before the Respondent provided its observations.\n\n19.\n\nThe Secretary-General responded to the Parties later on 5 December 2017. She confirmed that \"Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 confer the power to recommend provisional measures only upon the Tribunal.\" The PM Request would therefore \"be considered by the Tribunal as a matter of priority upon its constitution.\" The Secretary-General also provided the Parties with a schedule for written submissions on the PM Request.\n\n20.\n\nOn 6 December 2017, the Claimant informed ICSID that local authorities had begun demolishing its local company\u2019s buildings. It submitted a number of photos and a video in support of its allegations.\n\n21.\n\nThe Parties filed their written submissions on the Application in accordance with the schedule set by the Secretary-General. On 13 December 2017, the Respondent submitted its Observations. On 18 December 2017, the Claimant submitted its Reply. On 22 December 2017, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder.\n\n22.\n\nIn the meantime, by letter of 11 December 2017, ICSID had informed the Parties that the ballot process had not resulted in the selection of a mutually acceptable candidate for President of the Tribunal.\n\n23.\n\nIn accordance with the Parties\u2019 agreed method of appointment, the Secretary-General proceeded with the appointment of the President. By letter of 20 December 2017, she proposed the appointment of Sir Daniel Bethlehem QC (British). Neither Party objected to this appointment. Sir Daniel accepted appointment as President of the Tribunal on 8 January 2018.\n\n24.\n\nOn 8 January 2018, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n25.\n\nOn 10 January 2018, the Tribunal (a) proposed that the first session be held by teleconference on either 1 or 2 February 2018, and (b) invited the Parties\u2019 views as to whether a hearing on provisional measures would be necessary. On 12 February 2018, the Tribunal circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 to help facilitate the Parties\u2019 discussion on procedural matters in advance of the first session. The Tribunal also proposed the appointment of Mr. Paolo Busco as Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n26.\n\nBased on the Parties\u2019 availability, the Tribunal confirmed that the first session would be held on 1 February 2018. Regarding the need for a hearing on provisional measures, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it did not think a hearing would be necessary, but that it would not object to a hearing by teleconference. The Claimant requested an extension of time to respond on this question, which the Tribunal granted. On 17 January 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it was \"not in a position to justify the necessity\" of a hearing on provisional measures and therefore would leave the question to the Tribunal.\n\n27.\n\nIn its letter of 17 January 2018, the Claimant also provided an update on the status of the demolition works. The Claimant noted that \"most buildings belonging to [its local subsidiary]\u2019s premises in Jinan have been demolished and that, for the most part, the machinery and stocks are now stored in a different location.\"\n\n28.\n\nOn the basis of the Parties\u2019 comments regarding the need for a hearing, the Tribunal informed the Parties on 19 January 2018 that it would consider whether there were any questions arising from the Parties\u2019 written submissions that might helpfully be put to the Parties for response in writing, and that it would, thereafter, consider whether a telephone hearing would be appropriate.\n\n29.\n\nOn 26 and 27 January 2018, the Parties submitted their comments on the draft of Procedural Order No. 1. They also consented to the appointment of Mr. Busco as Assistant to the Tribunal.\n\n30.\n\nOn 29 January 2018, in preparation for the first session, the Tribunal provided the Parties with an updated draft of Procedural Order No.1. In addition, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would hear, in the course of the first session, brief oral submissions on the issues of (a) the form, necessity and urgency of the provisional measures sought and resisted; and (b) whether it would be appropriate for the Tribunal to exercise its powers under ICSID Convention Article 47 and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39(3) to recommend provisional measures of its own initiative, and if interim provisional measures were warranted, the form they should take.\n\n31.\n\nThe first session was held as scheduled on 1 February 2018 by teleconference. Following the discussion of procedural matters, each Party was given the opportunity to address the issues relating to provisional measures which the Tribunal had indicated in its letter of 29 January 2018. The Parties also provided an update regarding the factual situation on the ground.\n\n32.\n\nFollowing the first session, an audio recording and written transcript of the teleconference were provided to the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENTS**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe following summary is based on the Parties\u2019 submissions and is provided to contextualise the Parties\u2019 arguments on the PM Request. The Tribunal takes no position with respect to disputed facts and the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the PM Request does not constitute a finding of fact on any issue by the Tribunal.\n\n**A. The Underlying Dispute**\n-----------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe dispute set forth in the Request for Arbitration arises out of the Claimant\u2019s investment in the PRC through a wholly owned subsidiary, Ji'nan Hela Schwarz Food Co., Ltd. (\"**JHSF**\"), which was established in 1996.2\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 8.\n\n35.\n\nIn 2001, JHSF was granted the legal right to use a parcel of state-owned industrial land in Shandong Province (the \"**Land**\") for 50 years, until 29 July 2051.3 After receiving this right, JHSF built a series of buildings on 4821.18 square meters of the Land (the \"**Buildings**\").4\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 9; **Exhibit C-1**, The People\u2019s Republic of China State-Owned Land Use Certificate, 2001.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 10.\n\n36.\n\nOn 11 September 2014, the Jinan Municipal Government issued a Housing Expropriation Decision to expropriate the Land and the Buildings (the \"**Expropriation Decision**\").5 According to the Respondent, this expropriation measure was implemented as part of the Huashan area renovation project, a program aimed at improving environmental and living conditions along the river Xiaoqing.6\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 11; Observations, \u00b6 11.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 9.\n\n37.\n\nIn November 2014, JHSF challenged the Expropriation Decision through an administrative process of the Shandong Provincial Government,7 but its application was rejected in an Administrative Review Decision dated 15 April 2016.8\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 12; Observations, \u00b6 12; **Exhibit C-2**, Application for Administrative Review, 7 November 2014.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 12; **Exhibit C-3**, Administrative Reconsideration Decision, The People\u2019s Government of Shandong Province, 15 April 2016.\n\n38.\n\nTo challenge that decision, JHSF brought an administrative lawsuit against the Jinan Municipal Government at the Intermediate People\u2019s Court.9 According to Hela, the Court did not hold a hearing or issue a substantive judgment. Rather, it issued a procedural ruling dismissing JHSF\u2019s complaint.10 That ruling was upheld by the Shandong High Court in a decision dated 6 December 2016.11\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 13; **Exhibit C-4**, Administrative Complaint, 3 May 2016.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 13; **Exhibit C-5**, Administrative Ruling, Shandong Jinan Intermediate People\u2019s Court, 19 July 2016. Respondent states that the suit was \"dismissed as meritless\": Observations, \u00b6 13.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 13; **Exhibit C-6**, Administrative Ruling, Shandong Higher People\u2019s Court, 6 December 2016.\n\n39.\n\nWhile this litigation was pending, on 29 August 2016, the Jinan Municipal Government issued a Housing Expropriation Compensation Decision (the \"**Compensation Decision**\"), in which it offered to pay compensation to JHSF in the amount of Rmb 32,954,380 (about USD 5 million).12 According to the Claimant, this amount is wholly insufficient. The Respondent asserts that JHSF did not comply with the Compensation Decision or apply for administrative review.13\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 14; Respondent\u2019s Letter to Claimant of 4 December 2017; Observations, \u00b6 18; **Exhibit C-7**, Expropriation Compensation Decision No. 5, Jinan Municipal Government, 29 August 2016.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter to Claimant of 4 December 2017, p. 2; Observations, \u00b6 23.\n\n40.\n\nOn 1 March 2017, the Jinan Municipal Government notified JHSF that it was required to collect its compensation and vacate the Buildings.14 In response, JHSF submitted observations to the Jinan Municipal Government, which in turn informed JHSF that it would seek a court order if the company did not comply with its obligations.15\n\nObservations, \u00b6 24; **Exhibit C-9**, Exigent Notice for Implementing the Expropriation Compensation Decision, Jinan Municipal Government, l March 2017.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 24.\n\n41.\n\nOn 2 May 2017, the Claimant filed the Request for Arbitration with ICSID.\n\n42.\n\nOn 22 May 2017, the Jinan Municipal Government applied for enforcement of the Compensation Decision at the Licheng People\u2019s Court of Jinan City. Following a hearing on 5 June 2017, the Court issued a decision on 12 June 2017 (the \"**Enforcement Decision**\"), granting the enforcement application and ordering JHSF to vacate the Buildings within ten days of service.16 The Enforcement Decision was served on JHSF through its attorneys on 16 June 2017.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Letter to Claimant of 4 December 2017, p. 2.\n\n43.\n\nJHSF did not vacate the Buildings, and the Municipal Government did not undertake any enforcement action for the following five months.\n\n44.\n\nOn 17 November 2017, JHSF was informed by an administrative ruling that compensation in the amount corresponding to the amount stated in the Compensation Decision had been placed in escrow at the Licheng District Court.17\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 18; **Exhibit C-12**, Administrative Ruling of the Jinan Licheng District People\u2019s Court, 16 November 2017; *see* Observations, \u00b6 32.\n\n**B. Factual Basis of the Application**\n---------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThroughout the events described above, JHSF remained in operation and occupied the Buildings.\n\n46.\n\nOn 30 November 2017, the Jinan Municipal Government issued a public announcement ordering JHSF to evacuate the Buildings within five days, failing which it would initiate forced evacuation (the \"**Eviction Notice**\").18 The Claimant understood this to mean that demolition of the Buildings could begin as soon as 5 December 2017. Photos submitted by the Claimant showed red signs drawn on the ground in front of the entrance to the Buildings, which according to the Claimant, were \"understood as a further threat by the local authorities.\"19\n\n**Exhibit C-13**, Public Announcement by the Jinan Licheng District Municipal People\u2019s Government, 30 November 2017.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 21; **Exhibit C-14**, Photos of JHSF premises, 4 December 2017.\n\n47.\n\nAt that time, most of the buildings in the area surrounding JHSF\u2019s premises had already been demolished, and the construction of new buildings had begun.20\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 22; **Exhibit C-15**, Satellite photos of the Land and surrounding area, various dates.\n\n48.\n\nAs noted above, the Claimant wrote to the Respondent on 1 and 4 December 2017, demanding that it take immediate action to prevent the demolition of the Buildings. After the Claimant filed its PM Request on 4 December 2017, the Respondent responded to the Claimant\u2019s correspondence, stating that the Municipal Government\u2019s actions were justified and that the Respondent was not therefore in a position to intervene.\n\n**C. Developments Subsequent to the PM Request**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nDemolition of the Buildings began on 6 December 2017, and production at JHSF\u2019s facilities stopped completely in the second week of December 2017.21\n\nLetter from Claimant to ICSID of 6 December 2017 and attachments; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 3 and 5.\n\n50.\n\nThe Parties agree that, as of 1 February 2018, the factual circumstances on the ground were as follows:22\n\n(a) JHSF\u2019s premises had been fully evacuated.\n\n(b) All the Buildings had been demolished.\n\n(c) Machinery that had been located on JHSF\u2019s premises was stored and under the Claimant\u2019s control.\n\nFirst Session Tr. 68:1-69:10.\n\n**IV. APPLICABLE LEGAL FRAMEWORK**\n----------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s power to grant provisional measures is embodied in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39.\n\n52.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n53.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 39 states in relevant part:\n\n(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding, a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n(2) The Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1).\n\n(3) The Tribunal may also recommend provisional measures on its own initiative or recommend measures other than those specified in a request. It may at any time modify or revoke its recommendations.\n\n(4) The Tribunal shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n54.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal summarises each Party\u2019s position on the PM Request, including their views on the applicable legal standard and whether the requested measures are warranted in this case. Since the PM Request was filed, the Parties\u2019 positions have evolved with the changing factual circumstances. For the sake of completeness, this section includes the main arguments advanced by the Parties both before and after the demolition of the Buildings.\n\n**A. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n***(1) Applicable Legal Standard***\n-----------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimant submits that ICSID tribunals have broad discretion to recommend provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.23 According to the Claimant, it is well recognized that such interim relief can be ordered to ensure that a party does not \"aggravate or extend the dispute or take justice into their own hands\".24\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 25.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 25, *quoting* *City Oriente Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/21, Decision on Provisional Measures, 19 November 2007, \u00b6 57.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that ICSID tribunals may order provisional measures when the following four requirements are met:\n\n(a) the arbitral tribunal must have *prima facie* jurisdiction;\n\n(b) the measures must be necessary to protect the applicant\u2019s rights;\n\n(c) the measures must be urgent; and\n\n(d) the measures must be proportional.25\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 27.\n\n57.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, all four requirements are met in the present case, as discussed in the subsections below.\n\n***(2) Prima Facie Jurisdiction***\n----------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the first requirement\u2014 *prima facie* jurisdiction\u2014has generally been uncontroversial in ICSID tribunals\u2019 decisions on provisional measures. It is met as long as there is not a \"clear lack of jurisdiction\".26\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 31, *quoting* *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation c.* Republic of Chile , ICSID Case No. ARB / 98/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, September 25, 2001, \u00b6 11 .\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant submits the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction in this case. In this context, Claimant raises the following points:\n\n(a) The Claimant is constituted under the laws of Germany and therefore qualifies as an \"investor\" under Article 1(2)(a) of the BIT.27 Both Germany and the PRC were ICSID Member States at all relevant times. Therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae*.\n\n(b) The Claimant\u2019s assets in the PRC qualify as an \"investment\" under Article 1 of the BIT, and the present dispute arises out the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT with respect to that investment. This establishes the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione materiae*.28\n\n(c) The Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* because the dispute arose in 2014, long after the BIT entered into force.29\n\n(d) As regards jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis*, the Respondent consented in writing to ICSID arbitration by way of Article 9(3) of the BIT and the Claimant has expressed its consent by filing the Request for Arbitration.30\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 32.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 33.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 34.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 35.\n\n***(3) Rights to be Protected***\n--------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimant seeks provisional measures to protect the following rights:\n\n(a) The right to preservation of the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute; and\n\n(b) The right to the procedural integrity of the arbitral proceedings, in particular with respect to the preservation of evidence and the preservation of its access to effective reparative relief.31\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 29\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant argues that in the course of litigation, parties have \"a general obligation to refrain from actions which could aggravate, exacerbate or extend the dispute.\"32 According to the Claimant, provisional measures may be necessary to maintain a certain factual or legal situation when a party\u2019s actions threaten substantive rights at the centre of the dispute.33\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 38, *citing*, *inter alia*, *Electricity Company of Sofia and Bulgaria (Belgium v. Bulgaria),* Interim Measures of Protection of 5 December 1939, PCIJ Rep Series A/B No 79, 199 (\"to the effect that the parties to a case must abstain from any measure capable of exercising a prejudicial effect in regard to the execution of the decision to be given and, in general, not allow any step of any kind to be taken which might aggravate or extend the dispute... The Court, indicates as an interim measure, that pending the final judgment of the Court... the State of Bulgaria should ensure that no step of any kind is taken capable of prejudicing the rights claimed by the Belgian Government or of aggravating or extending the dispute submitted to the Court\").\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 39.\n\n62.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimant asserts that the right to procedural integrity, including access to evidence and effective relief, is a right capable of protection by provisional measures.34\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 52, *citing*, *inter alia*, C. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention*, *A Commentary* (2nd ed., Cambridge University Press, 2009), p. 779; *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v.

Meaning of Necessity*\n-------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimant acknowledges that international courts and tribunals have determined that interim measures are necessary when a party\u2019s actions could cause \"irreparable harm\", which the International Court of Justice (\"**ICJ**\") has interpreted as harm that cannot be remedied by monetary damages.35\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 42, *citing Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v.

Given the commercial context of ICSID cases, most harm \"could be considered compensable eventually.\"36 Therefore, in the Claimant\u2019s view, adopting the \"irreparable harm\" standard in ICSID cases \"may theoretically allow one party to aggravate the dispute, increasing the damages inflicted on the other party without redress, until the rendering of a final award.\"37\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 43, *quoting* R.

Albania*\"), \u00b6 3.34.\n\n*b. Necessity in the Present Case*\n----------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimant states that \"the necessity of a provisional measure must be assessed by reference to the specific right that the applicant seeks to protect\".40 Therefore, the Claimant discusses the requirement of necessity with respect to each category of rights it seeks to protect.\n\nPM Request, \u00b637, *citing* *Biwater v. Tanzania*, \u00b6 59.\n\n67.\n\nFirst, the Claimant addresses the necessity of measures to preserve of the status quo and non-aggravation of the dispute. The Claimant\u2019s position has evolved as the factual situation on the ground has changed.\n\n68.\n\nIn the PM Request, before the Buildings were demolished, the Claimant argued that a provisional measure suspending execution of the Expropriation Decision was necessary to \"maintain the current legal and factual situation until a final decision is made as to the lawfulness of the expropriation.\"41 In the Claimant\u2019s view, execution of the Expropriation Decision would \"destroy the going concern which constitutes the whole of the Claimant\u2019s investment in China.\"42 Such harm would not only be \"serious\" and \"significant\"; it would be \"irreparable\".43 Further, at that time, the threat was \"not merely hypothetical, but tangible and fast-approaching\".44 Therefore, the Claimant asserted that the necessity threshold would have been met even under the ICJ\u2019s more restrictive interpretation.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 48.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 49.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 49.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 51.\n\n69.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would seek not only monetary damages, but restitution in kind (in the form of restoration of its land use right).45 The Claimant argued that restitution would be impossible if the Buildings were destroyed.46\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 50. The Claimant did not request restitution in the Request for Arbitration.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 50.\n\n70.\n\nIn the Reply, which was submitted while the demolition of the Buildings was ongoing, the Claimant alleged that the demolition works were \"putting an end to\" JHSF\u2019s operations and, if completed, would \"have the effect of totally destroying the Claimant\u2019s investment in China.\"47\n\nReply, \u00b6 5.\n\n71.\n\nThe first session was held after the Buildings had been demolished. In its oral submissions during the first session, the Claimant confirmed that it maintained its request for provisional measures, \"especially with regards to [its] request that the Arbitral Tribunal order such measures that be deemed appropriate to order Respondent to refrain from taking [actions that aggravate the dispute].\"48\n\nFirst Session Tr. 71:19-72:1.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant explained that it was maintaining its request because the Respondent\u2019s support for the demolition of the Buildings was an affront to the spirit of the BIT and a violation of its duty not to aggravate the dispute.49 According to the Claimant, the timing of the Respondent\u2019s actions was particularly suspect; after authorities took no action for several months, \"all of a sudden things were extremely precipitated while we were trying to seek an agreement on how to constitute [the Tribunal]\".50 Therefore, the Claimant expressed concern that the Respondent would take further actions of this kind before the conclusion of this arbitration.51 For Claimant, the danger of repetition was made clear by the Respondent\u2019s willingness to take justice into its own hands while the PM Request was pending.52\n\nFirst Session Tr. 71:3-7.\n\nFirst Session Tr. 70:13-71:2.\n\nFirst Session Tr. 71:10-13.\n\nFirst Session Tr. 71:13-18.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimant also addressed the necessity of measures to protect procedural integrity. The Claimant argued in the PM Request that suspension of the Expropriation Decision was necessary for the following reasons:\n\n(a) Destruction of the buildings would \"make it significantly more difficult for the Claimant to gather and present evidence concerning the appropriate amount of reparative damages or compensation due by the Respondent, which is a central issue in this dispute.\"53\n\n(b) The destruction of JHSF\u2019s business would \"have irreparable procedural consequences in terms of the remedies available to the Claimant\".54 In particular, reinstatement of the Claimant\u2019s land rights as restitution in kind would no longer be possible.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 54.\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 57.\n\n74.\n\nFollowing the demolition of the Buildings, the Claimant no longer seeks suspension of the Expropriation Decision in order to preserve the procedural integrity of the arbitration. However, the Tribunal understands that the Claimant is still requesting that the Tribunal order the Respondent to refrain from taking any action in the future that may prejudice the integrity of the proceedings.55\n\nReply, \u00b6 10; First Session Tr. 71:18-72:1.\n\n*(5) **Urgency***\n-----------------\n\n*a. Meaning of Urgency*\n-----------------------\n\n75.\n\nWith respect to the requirement of urgency, the Claimant submits that tribunals have broad discretion in determining whether a requested measure is urgent, and that they generally base such a determination on an objective factual analysis.56 The Claimant quotes Professor Schreuer\u2019s statement that the criterion of urgency is satisfied when \"a question cannot await the outcome of the award on the merits\".57 According to the Claimant, this test has been adopted in several cases.58 Further, the Claimant states that the threat to the applicant\u2019s interests must be \"imminent and likely, rather than being a mere possibility\".59\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 59, *citing* *Saipem S.p.A. v.

Urgency in the Present Case*\n--------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nIn the PM Request, the Claimant argued that the imminence of the threat to its investment, as demonstrated by the Eviction Notice and impending demolition works, made the Tribunal\u2019s intervention urgent.60\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 60.\n\n77.\n\nAs noted above, following the demolition of the Buildings, the Claimant\u2019s primary concern is that the Respondent will take further actions that aggravate or threaten the integrity of the dispute. During the first session, Claimant summarised its position as follows:\n\n[W]e are perceiving Respondent as an unpredictable opponent, and we see that there\u2019s risk of further actions by Respondent that could harm us in the proceedings, be it any influence taken on the ground and to any efforts, people who are under our influence or be it the materials and the machinery where it is located now. And that is, I guess, our concern then is why we maintain our request.61\n\nFirst Session Tr. 83:17-84:2.\n\n78.\n\nThis notwithstanding, in response to a question from the President of the Tribunal as to whether the Claimant had \"reason to think that there is some danger of a future action, and what kind of future action\",62 the Claimant\u2019s counsel stated that \"as of today, we have no clear indication of any further aggravation of whatever kind.\"63\n\nFirst Session Tr. 84:8-13.\n\nFirst Session Tr. 84:17-19.\n\n***(6) Proportionality***\n-------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Claimant notes that ICSID tribunals sometimes apply a proportionality test in assessing a request for provisional measures, to compare the harm the investor would suffer without the requested measure to the damage such a measure would inflict on the State.64\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 62.\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimant addressed the element of proportionality in the PM Request, arguing that the requested measures were proportional and would cause no harm to the Respondent. In the Claimant\u2019s view, by granting the measures, \"the Tribunal would not be altering the positions of the parties, rather, it would be safeguarding the continuation of the status quo that has been prevailing for the past 15 years, pending final resolution of the issues in dispute.\"65\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 63.\n\n***(7) Request for Relief***\n----------------------------\n\n81.\n\nIn its PM Request, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) ORDER the Respondent to suspend the enforcement of the Expropriation Decision pending these arbitration proceedings;\n\n(b) ORDER the Respondent to refrain from taking any other action that may prevent Jinan Hela Schwarz from pursuing its business or otherwise aggravate the dispute or prejudice the integrity of the proceedings;\n\n(c) ORDER the Respondent to bear the costs of this Request;\n\n(d) ORDER any other relief that the Tribunal or, as the case may be, the ICSID Secretary General, considers just and appropriate.\n\nIN ADDITION, as per the extreme urgency of the matter, the Claimant respectfully requests points (a) and (b) above to be granted as a TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER WITH IMMEDIATE EFFECT.66\n\nPM Request, \u00b6 64.\n\n82.\n\nIn view of the changed circumstances, in its Reply the Claimant amended its request for provisional measures, requesting of the Tribunal the following:\n\n(a) ***If the demolition works have not been completed by the time of the Tribunal\u2019s decision,*** ORDER the Respondent to suspend the enforcement of the Expropriation Decision pending these arbitration proceedings;\n\n(b) ***Alternatively,** **if the demolition works have been completed by the time of the Tribunal\u2019s decision,*** DECLARE that the Respondent has breached its procedural obligation to refrain from aggravating or extending the dispute pending these arbitration proceedings;\n\n(c) ***In any event,*** ORDER the Respondent to refrain from taking any other action that may aggravate the dispute or prejudice the integrity of the proceedings;\n\n(d) ***In any event,*** ORDER the Respondent to bear the costs of the Claimant\u2019s Request for Provisional Measures;\n\n(e) ***In any event,*** ORDER any other relief that the Tribunal or, as the case may be, the ICSID Secretary General, considers just and appropriate.67\n\nReply, \u00b6 10 (emphasis in original). *See* PM Request, \u00b6 64 for Claimant\u2019s original request for relief. The Claimant amended its request for relief in the Reply in response to factual developments. In the PM Request, the Claimant also requested a temporary restraining order, but did not maintain this request in the Reply, in light of the same factual developments.\n\n**B. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n***(1) Applicable Legal Standard***\n-----------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Respondent submits that ICSID tribunals may recommend provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39 \"*if the circumstances so require*.\"68 In the Respondent\u2019s view, such relief should be granted only in the extreme situation where the actions of a party could \"render proceedings meaningless or frustrate a possible result.\"69\n\nObservations, \u00b6 35 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\nObservations, \u00b6 41.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent highlights that the Claimant, as the applicant, bears the burden of proving that the requested measures are warranted in this case.70 According to the Respondent, the Claimant faces a high bar. ICSID tribunals consider provisional measures \"extraordinary\" relief, \"which should not be recommended lightly\".71 As commentators have noted,\n\napplicants are faced with a high threshold when seeking to establish that the interim relief requested is urgent and needed. This may explain the reluctance of the vast majority of the tribunals to grant interim relief in the context of investor state arbitration...72\n\nObservations, \u00b6 39.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 40, *quoting Occidental v.

Antonietti, \"Interim Relief in International Investment Agreements\" in Katia Yannaca-Small, *Arbitration under International Investment Agreement: A Guide to the Key Issues* (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 550 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\n85.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the exceptional nature of provisional measures is apparent from the fact that such relief is often requested before the parties have had the opportunity to present their full cases, and even before the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction has been verified.73\n\nObservation, \u00b6 42, *citing* *Perenco v. Ecuador*, \u00b6 43 (\"a Tribunal must be slow to grant to a party, before a full examination of the merits of the case, a remedy to which, on such examination, the party may be found to be not entitled. The Tribunal must be even slower where, as here, the jurisdiction of the tribunal to entertain the dispute has not been established. So the test laid down by the Article for the grant of provisional measures is a stringent one\" (emphasis added by the Respondent)).\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent largely agrees with the Claimant regarding the requirements that must be established to support a request for provisional measures. In particular, the Respondent states that the Claimant must \"provide the Tribunal with the necessary information and evidence enabling it to establish a *prima facie* case on jurisdiction and the merits\".74 In addition, the Respondent refers to the following requirements: (a) the existence of a right requiring protection, (b) \"urgent necessity to avoid imminent and irreparable harm\", and (c) the proportionality of the requested measures.75\n\nObservations, \u00b6 39.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 45-54, 111.\n\n***(2) Rights to be Protected***\n--------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent contends that provisional measures can protect only rights that exist at the time of the request, not hypothetical rights.76 In this context, the Respondent cites the following statement of the tribunal in *Maffezini v. Spain* :\n\nRule 39(1) specifies that a party may request \"... provisional measures for the preservation of its rights...\" The use of the present tense implies that such rights must exist at the time of the request must not be hypothetical nor are ones to be created in the future.77\n\nObservations, \u00b6 46.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 46, *quoting* *Maffezini v. Spain*, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\n88.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, tribunals must be cautious not to prejudge any aspect of the Parties\u2019 dispute or recommend measures that could \"render a final award irrelevant\".78\n\nObservations, \u00b6 47, *citing* *PNG v. Papua New Guinea*, \u00b6 121 (\"Granting a request for provisional measures must not involve the tribunal prejudging the merits of the case. It is essential, in this regard, that a tribunal not prejudge, either consciously or unconsciously, the resolution of any aspect of the parties\u2019 respective claims and defenses. The Respondent also correctly refers to this rule as 'the principle that an arbitral tribunal cannot grant a decision on the merits under the guise of interim relief' (emphasis added by the Respondent)).\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that in the present case, the Claimant seeks measures that do not correspond to its existing rights. With respect to the Claimant\u2019s request (subsequently withdrawn) that the Tribunal order suspension of the Expropriation Decision, the Respondent\u2019s position in its Observations was that neither international law nor the BIT give foreign investors the right to obstruct Respondent\u2019s sovereign power to expropriate property.79 Indeed, the Respondent pointed out that in the Request for Arbitration, the Claimant had not sought to impede any expropriation\u2014the Claimant merely alleged that the Respondent had failed to provide adequate compensation. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s request went beyond the Claimant\u2019s existing rights and also beyond the relief sought in the Request for Arbitration.80\n\nObservations, \u00b6 58.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 58-60.\n\n90.\n\nAs set forth in its Rejoinder, the Respondent also considers the Claimant\u2019s alternative requests for relief contained in the Reply to be inappropriate. With respect to the Claimant\u2019s request that the Tribunal declare the Respondent in breach of its obligation to refrain from aggravating or extending the dispute, the Respondent states:\n\nProvisional measures can only safeguard the parties\u2019 rights *pendente lite*. Declaratory relief, however, is a final conclusion on the merits. Accordingly, this request must fail.81\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 21. *See also* First Session Tr. 78:7-13 (\"it is not within the power of the Arbitral Tribunal to issue such a declaration as part of a request for interim relief. It is, in our view, only within the power of the Tribunal to recommend interim measures, not issue a declaration of this nature that has been asked for by the Claimant\").\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent further asserts that the Claimant\u2019s request for an order enjoining the Respondent from \"taking any other action that may aggravate the dispute or prejudice the integrity of the proceedings\" is \"impermissibly broad and unspecific\" and should be denied on that basis.82\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 22, citing Reply, \u00b6 10(c).\n\n92.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent\u2019s position is that the rights invoked by the Claimant have not been threatened. This argument is summarised further in the section below addressing the necessity and urgency of the requested measures.\n\n***(3) Necessity and Urgency***\n-------------------------------\n\n*a. Meaning of Necessity and Urgency*\n-------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Respondent submits that provisional measures are not \"necessary\" if the applicant can be adequately compensated by damages, and are not \"urgent\" if the matter can await the final award.83\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 49-53.\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent is not concerned with the distinction between \"irreparable harm' and other formulations of the standard, such as \"serious harm'.84 For the Respondent, the relevant point is that a request for provisional measures falls outside Article 47 of the ICSID Convention when the alleged harm can be made good by damages or otherwise at a later stage.85 Thus, regardless of the formulation used, the power to grant provisional measures \"is limited to the exceptionally rare situation where there is no alternative to protect the final relief sought by the claimant in the arbitration'.86\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53, *citing* *CEMEX v. Venezuela*, \u00b6\u00b6 46-56.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 54.\n\n*b. Necessity and Urgency in the Present Case*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s main argument is that none of the substantive or procedural rights invoked by the Claimant has been threatened in any way by the demolition of the Buildings. For the Respondent, it follows that the requested measures are neither necessary nor urgent.87\n\nObservations, \u00b6 95.\n\n96.\n\n*First*, the Respondent contends that implementation of the Expropriation Decision does not disrupt the status quo or aggravate the dispute.88 In this regard, the Respondent cites the tribunal\u2019s statement in *Churchill v. Indonesia* that \"[a]n allegation that the *status quo* has been altered or that the dispute has been aggravated needs to be buttressed by concrete instances of intimidation or harassment.\"89\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 63 *et seq.*\n\nObservations, \u00b6 65, *citing* *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case Nos. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 14, 22 December 2014, \u00b6 72 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\n97.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to show that any actions taken with respect to JHSF are being used to benefit Respondent in this arbitration.90 In particular, there is no evidence that the Expropriation Decision was adopted or implemented arbitrarily or in bad faith, and there is not even a suggestion of intimidation or harassment. Rather, in the Respondent\u2019s view, it is clear from the factual record (which is largely undisputed) that authorities carried out the expropriation following the normal procedure under Chinese law.91\n\nObservations, \u00b6 66; First Session Tr. 73:1-7.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 70-76; First Session Tr. 73:8-22.\n\n98.\n\n*Second*, the Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s access to evidence is unaffected by the Expropriation Decision.92 According to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s allegation that demolition of the Buildings would destroy key evidence and make it difficult to collect evidence related to quantum is untenable for the following reasons:\n\n(a) The Claimant has presented no evidence to support its allegation.93\n\n(b) With respect to the evidence allegedly contained within the Buildings, \"one would expect a normal business acting in good faith and conducting litigation to have transferred, replicated or otherwise secured any such information before the evacuation measures were implemented\".94\n\n(c) The Claimant should already have the necessary evidence on quantum. In the course of the expropriation proceedings, JHSF\u2019s land use rights and Buildings were the subject of several valuations, which the Claimant contested. Indeed, in the Request for Arbitration, Claimant included a price per square meter for its land use right.95\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 78 *et seq.*\n\nObservations, \u00b6 82.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 83.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 83, *citing* Request for Arbitration, \u00b6 18.\n\n99.\n\n*Third*, the Respondent contends that there is no threat to the Claimant\u2019s ability to have its case fairly decided.96 For the Respondent, the only possible consequence of the demolition of the Buildings is financial loss, which can easily be compensated by monetary damages.97 Indeed, the Claimant sought only monetary damages in the Request for Arbitration. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant\u2019s attempt to bolster the PM Request by adding a request for restitution in kind is futile, as a request for provisional measures \"must relate to the Claimant\u2019s actual case, and not a hypothetical claim.\"98 In any event, the Claimant seeks restitution as an *alternate* remedy, acknowledging that monetary compensation remains an option.99 In the Respondent\u2019s view, this is consistent with the principle set forth in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* that when restitution in kind is materially impossible, full reparation can be achieved through monetary compensation.100\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 85 *et seq.*\n\nObservations, \u00b6 88.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 90.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 91, *citing* PM Request, \u00b6 13.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 92, *citing Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland),* Merits, Judgment, 13 September 1928, PCIJ Series A, No. 17, \u00b6 181.\n\n100.\n\n*Fourth*, in the Rejoinder, the Respondent denies that, by permitting the demolition works to go forward, it interfered with the Tribunal\u2019s authority or took justice into its own hands.101\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 13-19.\n\n101.\n\n*Fifth*, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to establish any issue that cannot await the outcome of the final award. In particular, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s allegation that the execution of the Expropriation Decision threatens to destroy the Claimant\u2019s investment in the PRC.102 It argues that the Claimant draws a connection between the demolition of the Buildings and the destruction of JHSF\u2019s business which is unsupported by evidence. For the Respondent, it appears that the Claimant\u2019s equity interest in JHSF would be unaffected.103 Furthermore, the Respondent asserts that JHSF has been aware of the Expropriation Decision for years and had ample time to relocate its operations.104 In any event, even if JHSF\u2019s business were destroyed, the Respondent\u2019s position is that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that this loss could not be adequately compensated by damages.105\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 97-106; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 5-10.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 100.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 99; Rejoinder, \u00b6 8.\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 102-106, *citing Hydro v. Albania*, \u00b6 3.34 (finding that the destruction of the claimants\u2019 investment in the host State could be repaired by an award of damages, making provisional measures unnecessary).\n\n102.\n\nDuring the first session, the Parties were given an opportunity to comment on the necessity and urgency of the requested measures in light of the completion of the demolition works. The Respondent maintained the arguments summarised above, and it added the following:\n\n[E]ven on Claimant\u2019s own case, there should not be any urgency at this point in time with respect to any of the requests being made by the Claimant, including the more subsidiary request that deals with procedural rights and access to evidence.\n\nTo the extent that any evidence has been available on these premises, the Claimant has had ample time to secure such evidence. To the extent something existed at the premises at the time of demolition, it has been taken care of and stored, according to our understanding. There are no urgent risks that the Tribunal would need to assess at this point in time.106\n\nFirst Session Tr. 80:14-81:4.\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent further observed that provisional measures are not meant to protect against a potential hypothetical harm resulting from uncertain actions. Rather, they are meant to protect the applicant from imminent harm, which is not present in this case.107\n\nFirst Session Tr. 85:8-12, *citing Occidental v. Ecuador*, \u00b6 89.\n\n*(4) **Proportionality***\n-------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent commented on the element of proportionality in its Observations, before the demolition works were completed.\n\n105.\n\nAt that time, the Respondent position was that suspension of the Expropriation Decision would constitute a disproportionate interference with Respondent\u2019s sovereign rights.108 On the one hand, the Respondent saw no harm or prejudice to the Claimant if the measures were not granted. The Claimant was simply subject to a \"*bona fide* expropriation and compensation procedure that is fully grounded in Chinese and international law\".109\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 110-115.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 112.\n\n106.\n\nOn the other hand, the Respondent considered that granting the measures would have interfered with the public interest and sovereignty of the PRC. Specifically, the measures would have obstructed \"an urban redevelopment project, which will provide public facilities (i.e. education, healthcare and cultural facilities), affordable housing and a cleaner environment.\"110\n\nObservations, \u00b6 114.\n\n*(5) **Request for Relief***\n----------------------------\n\n107.\n\nIn both its Observations and Rejoinder, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(1) REFUSE the Claimant\u2019s Request in its entirety; and\n\n(2) ORDER the Claimant to bear all costs incurred in connection with its Request on a full indemnity basis, including but not limited to, legal fees and expenses.111\n\nObservations, \u00b6 117; Rejoinder, \u00b6 23.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal has given careful consideration to the submissions of the Parties, both written and oral. As noted above, the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Claimant\u2019s PM Request, including the reasons therefore set out in summary form, was communicated to the Parties by correspondence from the Secretary of the Tribunal dated 10 April 2018. This Procedural Order reflects that correspondence and constitutes the fully reasoned and elaborated Decision of the Tribunal.\n\n109.\n\nGiven the developments on the ground since the PM Request and the written submissions of the Parties, the Tribunal is in a position to reach its decision on the PM Request with an economy of analysis. Principles of judicial economy, equally relevant in arbitral proceedings such as this, dictate that the Tribunal does not engage in analyses and conclusions of law where none is necessary. The Tribunal accordingly refrains from an analysis of the legal requirements of provisional measures or of other issues not strictly necessary for its decision. Further, as noted above, the Tribunal takes no position with respect to disputed facts and this decision does not constitute a finding of fact on any issue by the Tribunal.\n\n110.\n\nWhether in ICSID proceedings or in proceedings before other international courts and tribunals, the recommendation (or indication, or other relevant term) of provisional measures is an exceptional measure of interim relief that is necessary to preserve the rights of a party in circumstances of urgency. Different language may be used in different circumstances or before different fora to describe the test for provisional measures and it may be that, in some circumstances, the decision will turn on the nuanced formulation. The Tribunal is satisfied, however, in the circumstances of the present case, that its decision does not turn on nuance and the Tribunal accordingly sees no need to engage in a jurisprudential review about the precise scope of the relief contemplated in Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Article 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. What is plain is that the fundamental requirement for provisional measures is that such measures can only ever be warranted in circumstances in which the need for such measures is urgent and the measures in contemplation are necessary, *inter alia*, to prevent imminent harm to a party. Although there is no uniformity of jurisprudence on this point, the Tribunal considers that the exceptional nature of provisional measures warrants consideration of whether the rights to be preserved are at real and imminent risk of irreparable harm, this being material to both the necessity and the urgency of the relief in contemplation.\n\n111.\n\nIn the present case, whatever may have been the situation when the Claimant submitted its PM Request, and without prejudice to whether a recommendation of provisional measures may or may not have been warranted at that stage, there is no longer anything onto which a recommendation of provisional measures could properly fasten. The Parties appear to agree that the buildings that were the subject of the PM Request were vacated and have since been destroyed, and that the related machinery and materials are now stored and under the Claimant\u2019s control. As recounted above, the Claimant submitted its urgent PM Request on 4 December 2017. Demolition of the buildings began on 6 December 2017, with production at JHSF\u2019s facilities having stopped completely in the second week of December 2017. By all accounts, the demolition of the buildings was largely complete by around this time. The Tribunal was constituted on 8 January 2018.\n\n112.\n\nMindful of these developments, the Tribunal explored with the Parties, in the first session on 1 February 2018, the continuing basis of the request for provisional measures. The Respondent submitted that there was none. The Claimant maintained its request, however, expressing concern about the possibility of aggravation of the dispute in the future. When pressed by the Tribunal about the reality of the risk of aggravation, however, counsel for the Claimant very properly stated that \"as of today, we have no clear indication of any further aggravation of whatever kind.\"112\n\nFirst Session Tr. 84:17-19.\n\n113.\n\nIn the circumstances, the conclusion is unavoidable that a recommendation of provisional measures is not warranted in this case at this time. The Claimant\u2019s PM Request must accordingly be denied. There is at present no right that requires interim protection pending a determination on the merits of this case. A recommendation of provisional measures cannot be used as a basis to restore the Claimant to the *status quo ante*, before the buildings that were the subject of the PM Request were demolished. If the Claimant can sustain its allegation on the merits, the Tribunal will determine the appropriate at that stage. Whatever may be the prejudice to the Claimant, it is prejudice that has already been suffered.\n\n114.\n\nThis conclusion is without prejudice to the right of the Claimant, or indeed of the Respondent, to request the recommendation of provisional measures for the preservation of its right in the future, or to the recommendation of any such measures by the Tribunal on its own initiative, should the circumstances so warrant, pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n115.\n\nWithout prejudice to the preceding, having regard to the circumstances that gave rise to the PM Request, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to remind the Parties that it is incumbent upon them not to undertake any conduct that would aggravate the dispute or would otherwise cause prejudice to the arbitral process.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n116.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(a) The Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures is denied.\n\n(b) The Tribunal defers any question of costs in connection with the request for provisional measures for consideration at a later stage."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No.3 (Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation)", "Type": "Bifurcation", "Date": "2018-12-17T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No.3 (Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 2 May 2017, Hela Schwarz GmbH (\"**Hela Schwarz**\" or \"**Claimant**\"), filed a Request for Arbitration commencing these proceedings. The Tribunal was constituted on 8 January 2018. Procedural Order No.1, including a procedural timetable, was issued on 9 March 2018 (\"**PO#1**\"). The proceedings are conducted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006.\n\n2.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural timetable, the Claimant submitted its Memorial dated 29 June 2018 (\"**Memorial**\"). On 1 October 2018, the People's Republic of China (\"**PRC**\" or \"**Respondent**\") submitted a Memorial on Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation (\"**Bifurcation Request**\"). Pursuant to \u00a716.2 of PO#1, this included \"a reasoned application for the [objections] to be addressed in a preliminary procedure\".\n\n3.\n\nPursuant to \u00a716.3 of PO#1, the Tribunal is required to \"determine the subsequent procedure after affording the Claimant an opportunity to present its views on the question of bifurcation.\"\n\n4.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural schedule set out in Annex A of PO#1, the Claimant submitted Observations on the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation dated 29 October 2018 (\"**Observations**\"), opposing the Respondent's request for bifurcation. The Respondent thereafter submitted a Reply on Bifurcation dated 5 November 2018 (\"**Reply**\") and the Claimant submitted a Rejoinder on Bifurcation dated 12 November 2018 (\"**Rejoinder**\").\n\n5.\n\nPO#1 makes it clear that the determination required of the Tribunal at this stage of the proceedings is a decision on the Respondent's request for bifurcation, not a decision on the substance of the Respondent's preliminary objections. This Procedural Order accordingly addresses only the issue of the request for bifurcation, without prejudice to any question going to the substance of the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal has given careful consideration to the Parties' submissions on the Bifurcation Request, which are summarised in Section II below. For the reasons set out in Section III below, the Tribunal has concluded that the request for bifurcation must be denied, with the consequence that the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility will fall to be addressed by the Tribunal in due course alongside its consideration of the merits of the Claimant\u2019s case. The Tribunal\u2019s order is contained in Section IV below.\n\n7.\n\nThe Parties have set out their positions on substantive aspects of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility in their pleadings referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 above. This said, the Parties\u2019 pleadings subsequent to the Bifurcation Request were directed to the question of bifurcation, rather than to the substance of the objections to jurisdiction and admissibility. For the avoidance of doubt, as is expressly contemplated in Alternative Schedule 2 of Annex A of PO#1, which will now be controlling of the procedural schedule going forward, the Parties are afforded an opportunity to further address the substantive issues engaged by the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility in the remaining scheduled pleadings. Similarly, also for the avoidance of doubt, and as is made clear in \u00a716.5 of PO#1, the Respondent is not precluded from raising other objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility in its Counter-Memorial.\n\n8.\n\nIn the following parts of this Order, the Tribunal addresses the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections and the Parties\u2019 arguments on those objections. This discussion is necessary to contextualise the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the request for bifurcation. The Tribunal emphasises that it has made no determination on the substance of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, and nothing in this Order preempts any later or different finding of fact or conclusion of law.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal summarises briefly each Party\u2019s position on the Bifurcation Request, including their views on the applicable legal standard and whether bifurcation of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility is appropriate in this case.\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent raises four objections relating to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and one objection relating to the admissibility of the claim. Its position is that this proceeding should be bifurcated so that these objections can be decided in a preliminary phase. Specifically, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(1) decide issues relating to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and the admissibility of the Claimant\u2019s claims in a preliminary phase of the proceeding in accordance with Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, Rule 41(4) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and Alternative Schedule 3 of Procedural Order No. 1 - Annex A; and\n\n(2) suspend proceedings on the merits pending the hearing and decision on preliminary objections pursuant to Rule 41(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.1\n\nReply, \u00b6 62; *see also* Request, \u00b6 238(1).\n\n*(1) **Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility are, in brief summary, as follows.\n\n*a. Objection 1: Investment*\n----------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s first objection is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the Claimant\u2019s claims because they do not arise directly out of an investment, as required by the ICSID Convention and the Agreement between the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Federal Republic of Germany on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (\"**BIT**\").2\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 80 *et seq.*\n\n13.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this dispute relates exclusively to the land use rights and other assets of the Claimant\u2019s subsidiary, Jinan Hela Schwarz Food Co. Ltd. (\"**JHSF**\").3 The Respondent observes that JHSF is not a claimant in this arbitration, and that JHSF does not qualify as an investor under the BIT because it is incorporated in the PRC.4\n\nRequest, \u00b6 88.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 90.\n\n14.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent's position is that the Claimant lacks standing to pursue claims relating to JHSF's assets.5 The Respondent further argues that\n\n[t]he Tribunal cannot go into the substance of a claim that does not concern the Claimant's legal interests, but instead those of a third party who is not part of these proceedings (i.e. JHSF). The Chinese company JHSF is not a protected investor under the BIT, and its rights and assets cannot be considered protected investments.6\n\nRequest, \u00b6 88.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 90.\n\n15.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Claimant has legal rights only with respect to its shares in JHSF, but it has failed to make out a plausible shareholder's claim.7 In particular, the Claimant has not alleged any interference with its shares in JHSF, and has failed to put forward any evidence for its statement that the alleged measures caused the loss of \"almost\" all the value of those shares.8 Similarly, the Claimant has offered no evidence of any payment for its shares in JHSF or any other financial contribution, and it has not shown that it assumed any risk in making this alleged investment.9\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 99-106.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 101-104, *quoting* Claimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 247, 530.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 107-108.\n\n16.\n\nThe Respondent proposes that this objection be heard in a preliminary phase because, first, it is serious and substantial, as demonstrated by the lack of evidence the Claimant has filed regarding any harm to its investment.10 The Respondent further contends that the Parties agree that this objection is unrelated to the merits.11 Finally, the Respondent considers that \"Objection 1 can dispose of considerable portions of the case (e.g. the claim concerning the supposed diminution in value of shares held by the Claimant, or the claim concerning certain assets of JHSF), if not the entire arbitration\".12\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 15-16; *see* Request, \u00b6\u00b6 218-219.\n\nReply, \u00b6 14, *citing* Response, \u00b6 15. The Claimant rejects this characterization in its Rejoinder; *see* \u00b6 5(a).\n\nReply, \u00b6 14.\n\n*b. Objection 2: Article 9(1) and (2) of the BIT.*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s second objection to jurisdiction is based on Article 9(1)-(2) of the BIT, which provide:\n\n(1) Any dispute concerning investments between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party should as far as possible be settled amicably between the parties in dispute.\n\n(2) If the dispute cannot be settled within six months of the date when it has been raised by one of the parties in dispute, it shall, at the request of the investor of the other Contracting State, be submitted for arbitration.\n\n18.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, these provisions contains three steps, which constitute mandatory conditions to the Respondent\u2019s consent: (a) the investor informs the Respondent of a dispute and identifies the BIT\u2019s substantive obligations as the legal basis for its contentions; (b) the investor attempts to settle the dispute amicably with the Respondent as far as possible through negotiations; and (c) six months elapse without resolution of the dispute.13 The Respondent cites a \"long line of cases\" holding that where a State opts to condition its consent on such notice and negotiation requirements, they form a \"compulsory legal obligation\".14\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 110, 122.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 122, *citing, inter alia,* **RL-79**, *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Decision on Bifurcated Jurisdictional Issue, 5 March 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72; **RL-67**, *Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award on Jurisdiction, 15 December 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 132 (\"mandatory requirement\"), 142, 148-149.\n\n19.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to show that it properly notified the Respondent of the treaty claims raised in this arbitration or that it made a meaningful attempt to settle the dispute amicably. Rather, \"the only matters made known to local officials at the time were purely domestic complaints regarding the supposed undervaluation of JHSF\u2019s land and the alleged misapplication of Chinese laws and procedures\".15\n\nRequest, \u00b6 143.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that, as a result of the Claimant\u2019s failure to comply with Article 9(1)-(2) of the BIT, \"an integral part of the Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate was not respected\", and the case must be dismissed.16\n\nRequest, \u00b6147.\n\n21.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal should hear this objection in a preliminary phase for several reasons. *First,* the Respondent argues that the objection is well grounded, as made apparent by the Claimant\u2019s own misguided arguments on this issue in the Memorial and the Response.17\n\nRequest, \u00b6 220; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 20-22.\n\n22.\n\n*Second,* the Respondent asserts that this objection, if accepted, would dispose of all, or at least a significant part of the Claimant\u2019s claims.18 As an example, the Respondent states that \"the shareholder claim regarding the supposed devastation of JHSF\u2019s business would not have to be addressed\".19\n\nRequest, \u00b6 224; Reply, \u00b6 23.\n\nReply, \u00b6 23.\n\n23.\n\n*Third,* the objection is a discrete question independent from the merits of the dispute and will not require a fact-intensive inquiry.20 According to the Respondent, the \"Tribunal\u2019s main task for the purposes of ruling on Objection 2 will be to interpret Article 9 of the BIT\" and the \"focus of the objection is the Claimant\u2019s conduct, as opposed to the Respondent\u2019s, as would be the case for the merits\".21\n\nApril Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 39.\n\nReply, \u00b6 25.\n\n*c. Objection 3: Article 9(a) of the BIT Protocol*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s third objection to jurisdiction invokes Article 9(a) of the BIT Protocol, which states that:\n\nWith respect to investments in the People\u2019s Republic of China an investor of the Federal Republic of Germany may submit a dispute for arbitration under the following conditions only:\n\n(a) the investor has referred the issue to an administrative review procedure according to Chinese law\u2026\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent argues that this provision requires a \"domestic administrative review of the issues averred in the international legal proceedings\", and that this requirement is a \"compulsory precondition qualifying the Respondent's offer to arbitrate\".22\n\nRequest, \u00b6 151.\n\n26.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant did not even allege in the Memorial to have complied with the administrative review requirement, and in fact, the Claimant did not comply.23 The Respondent observes that any administrative proceedings held in the PRC were initiated by JHSF, not by the Claimant, as required by the BIT Protocol. Furthermore, JHSF opted *not* to seek administrative review of the Compensation Decision issued by the Jinan Municipal People's Government's on 29 August 2016, which is central to the Claimant's claims in this arbitration.24\n\nRequest, \u00b6 155.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 161.\n\n27.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Claimant's failure to comply with the administrative review requirement deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction.25\n\nRequest, \u00b6 163.\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent argues that all three relevant considerations weigh in favour of bifurcating Objection 3. In this regard, the Respondent asserts that the seriousness of the objection is evident from the Parties' disagreement over the interpretation of Article 9(a) of the BIT Protocol and its application to the relevant facts.26 In addition, the Respondent views the relevant facts as uncontested, such that any further briefing would be \"mainly legal in nature\".27\n\nReply, \u00b6 30.\n\nReply, \u00b6 31.\n\n29.\n\nFurther, if the objection prevails, it would \"defeat the Tribunal's jurisdiction in the entirety, or at least with respect to the issues other than those covered by the Expropriation Decision\".28\n\nReply, \u00b6 32.\n\n*d. Objection 4: Article 9(c) of the BIT Protocol*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent's fourth objection to jurisdiction is based on Article 9(c) of the BIT Protocol, which provides:\n\nWith respect to investments in the People's Republic of China an investor of the Federal Republic of Germany may submit a dispute for arbitration under the following conditions only:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(c) in case the issue has been brought to a Chinese court, it can be withdrawn by the investor according to Chinese law.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that this provision constitutes an additional mandatory precondition to the State's consent to arbitration.29 According to the Respondent, the \"Claimant must not have litigated the issues it now submits to investment arbitration to completion in the Chinese courts\".30\n\nRequest, \u00b6 168.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 169.\n\n32.\n\nIn this context, the Respondent highlights that JSHF challenged the expropriation of its land in Chinese courts, and that, because those proceedings have concluded, the matter cannot be withdrawn from the courts. Thus, the Respondent's view is that the Claimant cannot now raise that issue before an international tribunal, in light of Article 9(c) of the BIT Protocol.31\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 170-175.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent considers it appropriate to bifurcate this objection because it is well founded and goes directly to the State's consent to arbitrate, which \"is *sine qua non* for investment arbitration\".32 It is also sufficiently discreet for early determination. In this regard, the Respondent rejects the Claimant\u2019s attempt to create an overlap between this objection and the merits, including its attempt to plead a denial of justice. In the Respondent\u2019s view, the key facts relating to the objection are uncontested and unrelated to the merits, which revolve around the question of whether there was a substantial deprivation of JHSF\u2019s share value.33\n\nReply, \u00b6 35.\n\nReply, \u00b6 37.\n\n*e. Objection 5: Admissibility*\n-------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nSeparate from the preceding objections to jurisdiction, and further to them or alternatively, the Respondent submits that the bases of its jurisdictional objections also provide compelling reasons for the Tribunal to decline to hear the Claimant\u2019s claims \"independently from the lack of jurisdictional title or the merits.\"34 In particular, the Respondent\u2019s position is that even if the Tribunal were to find that Article 9(1)-(2) of the BIT and Article 9(a) and (c) are not preconditions to jurisdiction, but rather matters pertaining to admissibility, they would still be mandatory.35 Thus, the case must be dismissed in any event.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 176.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 180.\n\n***(2) Applicable Legal Standards***\n------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent position is that all five of its objections should be heard in a preliminary phase in the interest of procedural efficiency and fairness.\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, pursuant to Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3) and (4), ICSID tribunals have discretion to bifurcate the proceedings and hear objections to jurisdiction and admissibility in a preliminary phase.36 Indeed, many tribunals in cases under the ICSID Convention have opted for such a bifurcated proceeding.37 According to Professor Schreuer\u2019s Commentary on the ICSID Convention, \"treatment of jurisdictional issues as preliminary questions is standard procedure\".38\n\nRequest, \u00b6 190.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 198.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 199, *quoting* **RL-56**, C. Schreuer et al., *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (CUP 2009), pp. 534, 537.\n\n37.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, there are several benefits to this approach. It promotes efficiency and \"clarifies the basis and ambit of proceedings\".39 In addition, the Respondent states that bifurcation \"ensures that a party is not needlessly subject to improper proceedings\".40 For the Respondent, this point is especially important when a sovereign State is a party, in light of the \"basic principle of international law \u2026 that States need not give an account of themselves before an international court or tribunal on the substance of a dispute when jurisdiction has not yet been established\".41\n\nRequest, \u00b6 202.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 203.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 211, *citing* **RL-37**, Shabtai Rosenne, *The World Court: What It Is and How It Works*, (Brill 2003), p. 81.\n\n38.\n\nThe Respondent notes that \"efficiency is not just a question of speed and time savings. What instead matters is reaching the right result without needless input\".42 Thus, for the Respondent, bifurcation of preliminary objections may be warranted even if it might prolong the proceedings.43\n\nRequest, \u00b6 201; Reply, \u00b6 53.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n\n39.\n\nRegarding the legal framework, the Respondent submits that there is no strict test to be applied. Rather, the Tribunal should refer to \"the core notions of economy, efficiency and fairness\".44 In this context, the Respondent identifies three non-exhaustive considerations drawn from past investment cases:\n\n*First*, is the objection *prima facie* serious and substantial in that it is not frivolous or vexatious?\n\n*Second*, could the objection, if successful, dispose of the entirety of the Claimant's case? If not, could it dispose of an important or essential part of the dispute, reduce the complexity of the dispute and/or obtain clarity on the existence and scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction (before a full-fledged merits phase)?\n\n*Third*, is the objection capable of being disposed of preliminarily without prejudicing issues of liability, namely, is the objection unduly intertwined with the merits of the dispute?45\n\nRequest, \u00b6 204.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 204.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent notes the Claimant's agreement that the Tribunal has discretion to bifurcate the proceeding, and that the three considerations above are relevant to the Tribunal's determination.46\n\nReply, \u00b6 6.\n\n***(3) Whether Bifurcation is Appropriate in this Case***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent submits that each of its five objections satisfies the test for bifurcation because it (a) is \"substantial as a matter of fact and law\", (b) will dispose of all or a significant portion of the Claimant's claims, and (c) can be decided without entering into the merits of the dispute.47 In fact, the Tribunal can \"dispose of the entire matter on the basis of facts that are already on the record and that do not require any additional taking of evidence\".48\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 214 *et seq.*\n\nRequest, \u00b6 217.\n\n42.\n\nIn response to the Claimant's submissions on the Bifurcation Request, the Respondent contends, *inter alia*, that:\n\na. the Claimant's extensive submissions on the merits of the objections show that the objections are sufficiently serious to warrant bifurcation;49\n\nb. the Claimant has underestimated the work remaining in the arbitration,50 all of which could be avoided if the preliminary objections are decided in a preliminary phase.51\n\nReply, \u00b6 11.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 44-49.\n\nRequest, \u00b6\u00b6 225-228. Reply, \u00b6 46.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the Claimant's allegation of dilatory tactics on the part of the Respondent are misplaced, in light of the Respondent's compliance with all deadlines set by the Tribunal and considering the Claimant\u2019s own failure to submit its quantum expert report with the Memorial.52\n\nReply, \u00b6 58.\n\n**B. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Claimant opposes bifurcation and requests relief as follows:\n\nthe Claimant respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal issue a decision DISMISSING the Respondent's Request for Bifurcation and DIRECTING the Parties to proceed to the full merits phase in accordance with Alternative Schedule 2 of Procedural Order No. 1 (Annex A).\n\nThe Respondent should be ORDERED to pay all additional costs and expenses incurred by the Claimant in connection with the Respondent\u2019s Request for Bifurcation.53\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 90-91.\n\n***(1) Response to Objections to Jurisdiction and Admissibility***\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant\u2019s response to the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility are as follows.\n\n*a. Objection 1: Investment*\n----------------------------\n\n46.\n\nWith regard to the Respondent\u2019s objection to jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* the Claimant argues that bifurcation would be inappropriate because the Respondent\u2019s arguments are frivolous and can be easily dismissed.54\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 13-21, 61-63.\n\n47.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, this dispute arises directly out of its investment in the PRC, which consists of its shares in JHSF, as well as the investments it made through JHSF, including the expropriated land and buildings.55 The Claimant argues that these assets clearly fall within the BIT\u2019s definition of \"investment\", which expressly covers indirect investments.56 Indeed, the Claimant points out that Article 1(b) of the Protocol to the BIT defines \"Invested indirectly\" as follows:\n\n\"Invested indirectly\" means invested by an investor of one Contracting Party through a company which is fully or partially owned by the investor and having its seat in the territory of the other Contracting Party.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 9, 28.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, in accordance with this provision, investments made by JHSF are to be treated as the Claimant's investments.57\n\nResponse, \u00b6 19.\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's assertion that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate any harm to its investment. According to the Claimant, this is an issue for the merits, which is irrelevant for preliminary objections.58 In any event, the Claimant contends that the harm is evident based on the uncontested fact that \"the premises of JHSF were confiscated and demolished by the Jinan authorities and that, as a result, all economic activities of the Claimant have ceased\".59\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 11.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 12.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimant also rejects the Respondent's statement that the \"parties agree that this objection is unrelated to the merits\".60 To the contrary, the Claimant considers the \"Respondent's contention that the dispute is not related to the Claimant's investment is so far-fetched that it does not deserve any further attention\".61\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 5(a), *quoting* Reply, \u00b6 14.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 5(a).\n\n*b. Objection 2: Article 9(1) and (2) of the BIT*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimant considers the Respondent's second objection to be \"plainly untenable\".62 In particular, the Claimant challenges the Respondent's interpretation of Article 9(1)-(2) of the BIT. According to the Claimant, this \"cooling-off clause\" does not mandate negotiations. Rather, it contains a single requirement: that an investor \"raise\" the dispute at least six months prior to filing a request for arbitration.63 The Claimant submits that it complied with this requirement by repeatedly attempting to negotiate with the competent Chinese officials since 2014 in order to settle the dispute concerning the expropriation, as documented in the record.64\n\nResponse, \u00b622.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 22-25.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 28-32.\n\n52.\n\nIn any event, the Claimant asserts that, in the light of the \"informal and non-mandatory wording of Article 9(2) of the BIT\", the cooling off requirement \"does not constitute a formal pre-condition to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and/or the admissibility of the claim\".65\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 36, 38.\n\n53.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimant's position is that Objection 2 is not sufficiently serious to warrant bifurcation.66 Further, according to the Claimant, the objection is intertwined with the merits, as it relates directly to the Claimant's allegation that the PRC authorities failed to enter into good faith negotiations regarding the amount of compensation for JHSF's expropriated assets, in violation of the BIT.67\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 22-38, 61-63\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b667-71.\n\n*c. Objection 3: Article 9(a) of the Protocol of the BIT*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Objection 3 is founded on a flawed interpretation of the BIT and a misstatement of the facts.68*First*, the Respondent assumes that Article 9(a) of the Protocol of the BIT requires the exhaustion of local remedies. However, the Claimant sees nothing in the text to support that assumption. In the Claimant's view, the only requirement contained in that provision is that the investor refer \"the issue\" to an administrative review procedure before commencing arbitration.69\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 39-47.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 43.\n\n55.\n\n*Second*, the Claimant submits that the objection fails in any event because the Claimant complied with the administrative review requirement. Specifically, JHSF initiated administrative review proceedings in November 2014 to challenge \"the legality of the direct expropriation of its land-use right, which is also 'the issue' at the heart of this arbitration\".70 The Claimant points to the Respondent's own statement confirming this: \"JHSF applied unsuccessfully for administrative review of the Expropriation Decision\".71\n\nResponse, \u00b6 41.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 41, *quoting* Request, \u00b6 41.\n\n56.\n\n*Third*, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that the Claimant (as opposed to JHSF) was required to initiate the administrative review. According to the Claimant, \"a) JHSF is nothing but the alter ego of Hela-Schwarz and b) JHSF being the expropriated party, it was the only entity entitled to initiate administrative review of the expropriation decision under Chinese law\".72\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 17.\n\n57.\n\nThus, the Claimant argues that Objection 3 is not serious enough to be bifurcated.73 In addition, this objection is \"directly linked\" to the merits. In particular, a decision on the objection would require an analysis of the Claimant's treatment by Chinese administrative bodies, and the facts relevant to such an analysis are the same as those underlying the Claimant's claims.74\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6\u00b661-63.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 74-77.\n\n*d. Objection 4: Article 9(c) of the Protocol of the BIT*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's fourth objection is \"in manifest and direct contradiction with the clear terms of the BIT\".75 According to the Claimant, the text of Article 9(c) of the Protocol of the BIT makes clear that it is not a \"fork-in-the-road\" or \"election of remedies\" clause, as the Respondent suggests.76 Further, the Claimant points to the final sentence of Article 4(2) of the BIT, which provides:\n\nAt the request of the investor the legality of any such expropriation and the amount of compensation shall be subject to review by national courts, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 9.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 49.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 53.\n\n59.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, this provision expressly permits an investor to first submit the dispute to domestic courts and, absent effective redress, to then submit it to arbitration.77 The Claimant contends that this is exactly what it has done in the present case. It tried to litigate in the Chinese courts, but was not given the opportunity to fully present its case, and therefore turned to arbitration.78 In any event, the Claimant considers Article 9(c) of the Protocol of the BIT irrelevant, given that that no domestic proceedings were pending at the time it filed the request for arbitration.79\n\nResponse, \u00b6 50.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 31.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 56.\n\n60.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimant argues that this objection will be easily dismissed, making bifurcation counter-productive.80 In addition, according to the Claimant, the objection \"encompasses questions of whether domestic proceedings have taken place effectively, which is directly relevant to the Claimant's denial of justice claim\".81 Thus, in the case of a bifurcated proceeding, the Parties would have to make submissions and present evidence on the same facts and law twice.82\n\n*See* Response, \u00b6\u00b661-63.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 35.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 65.\n\n*e. Objection 5: Admissibility*\n-------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant does not specifically address the Respondent's objection to admissibility. However, its position is that bifurcation is unwarranted with respect to all of the Respondent's objections.\n\n***(2) Applicable Legal Standards***\n------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the 2006 ICSID Rules do not contain a presumption in favour of bifurcation, as opposed to the 1968 ICSID Rules.83 Rather, it is entirely up to the Tribunal whether to hear preliminary objections in a separate phase or together with the merits. For the Claimant, this approach can be explained by the fact that \"objections to jurisdiction are frequent but not always genuine, and often serve the respondent State's objective of delaying the proceedings\".84\n\nResponse, \u00b6 58.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 59.\n\n63.\n\nThe Claimant refers to certain factors that it considers relevant to the Tribunal's decision on the Bifurcation Request, including the seriousness of the objections, procedural efficiency, fairness, and proportionality.\n\n64.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"the issue of efficiency is directly linked to the likely outcome of the decision on preliminary objections\"; if a respondent's objections are ultimately rejected, bifurcation increases the overall time and costs of the proceedings.85 In particular, the Claimant states that the \"same factual issues would have to be pleaded and adjudicated twice. The same documentary evidence would be submitted and reviewed twice. The same fact witnesses would have to be heard twice\".86\n\nResponse, \u00b6 84.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 84.\n\n65.\n\nTherefore, in the Claimant's view, the first question for the Tribunal in considering whether to bifurcate this proceeding is: \"Are the objections raised by the Respondent the result of a genuine concern that the State parties (here the PRC and Germany) may not have intended to submit a dispute like the present one to ICSID arbitration?\"87 Another question addressed by the Claimant is whether the objections are linked to the merits.88\n\nResponse, \u00b6 60.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 64-77.\n\n66.\n\nFinally, the Claimant considers the Respondent's general statements about the benefits of bifurcation are unhelpful, because the critical question is whether bifurcation would promote efficiency and fairness *in the particular circumstances of this case*.89 In any event, the Claimant points to a statistical analysis of ICSID cases which, in its view, shows that bifurcation does not in fact promote efficiency.90\n\nResponse, \u00b6 79.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 81, *citing* **CL-0109**, Lucy Greenwood, \"Does Bifurcation Really Promote Efficiency?\", *Journal of International Arbitration* (Volume 28, Issue 2, 2011), p. 107 (\"The limited empirical data does not support the view that bifurcating proceedings limits the duration of the dispute.\").\n\n***(3) Whether Bifurcation is Appropriate in this Case***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimant's position is that bifurcation would be detrimental to the efficiency and fairness of this proceeding for the three main reasons:\n\n***First***, the Respondent's preliminary objections are in manifest contradiction with the letter of the BIT and with the established facts of the case. ***Second***, the objections raise factual issues that lie at the heart of the merits of this arbitration, and, hence, may not be prejudged before assessing the Claimant's substantive claims. ***Third***, bifurcation in this case would impose an unreasonable financial burden on the Claimant and would result in excessively long proceedings considering the relative simplicity of the case.91\n\nResponse, \u00b6 4.\n\n68.\n\nWith reference to the Procedural Timetable in Procedural Order No. 1, the Claimant argues that bifurcation would result in an extended proceeding in which an award on the merits could not be expected before the middle of 2022, five years after the registration of this case.92 More than a year would be dedicated to the Respondent's objections, which according to the Claimant, \"do not deserve that degree of attention\".93\n\nResponse, \u00b6 89; Rejoinder, \u00b6 39.\n\nResponse, \u00b663.\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimant sees no exceptional circumstances in this case that would justify such a long proceeding. In fact, the Claimant considers this a relatively simple case in which \"[t]he facts are straightforward and well-documented. None of the underlying facts entail any particularly technical issues or require special knowledge other than expertise in international law, with the exception of a few isolated issues of Chinese law\".94\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 38.\n\n70.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant asserts that the arbitration costs should be proportionate to the amount in dispute. Accordingly, \"the Tribunal should also be mindful of the fact that the amount in dispute \u2013 approximately EUR 25,000,000.00 \u2013 is comparatively low\".95 For the Claimant, this is especially important in the present circumstances, as there is \"a massive economic imbalance between the Parties\", and the Claimant's economic troubles have been caused by the Respondent\u2019s actions.96 In these circumstances, the Claimant argues that it would suffer an unreasonable burden as a result of bifurcation.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 92.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 91; *see* Rejoinder, \u00b6 40.\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent\u2019s arguments concerning the supposed efficiency of bifurcation, on the basis that they do not address the specific circumstances of this case. In addition, the Claimant considers the Respondent\u2019s position at odds with its \"dilatory and obstructive tactics\".97\n\nResponse, \u00b6 87. The Claimant states that \"[t]he most striking examples are (i) the time taken to fulfil its part in the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, (ii) its deliberate aggravation of the dispute following the Claimant\u2019s provisional measures request and, more recently, (iii) its unilateral decision to upload the supporting documentation to its Memorial on Preliminary Objections with a seven-day delay\".\n\n**III THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Tribunal has given careful consideration to the Parties\u2019 submissions. As noted in opening, the question the Tribunal is required to address at this stage of the proceedings is limited to whether bifurcation is warranted to enable the Respondent\u2019s objections to be addressed in a preliminary phase.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that unlike, for example, the International Court of Justice, in which proceedings on the merits are suspended upon receipt of preliminary objections,98 the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules do not mandate such action. On the contrary, there is no presumption in favour of bifurcation in ICSID proceedings. Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention provides simply that the Tribunal \"shall determine whether to deal with [objections to jurisdiction or competence] as a preliminary question or to join [them] to the merits of the dispute.\" ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3), under the heading \"Preliminary Objections\", provides, *inter alia,* that \"Upon the formal raising of an objection relating to the dispute, the Tribunal may decide to suspend the proceedings on the merits.\"99 The question of whether to bifurcate the proceedings so as to address in a preliminary phase objections that are characterised as \"preliminary\" is thus a matter of discretion for the Tribunal based on its appreciation of what the Respondent has described as \"the core notions of economy, efficiency and fairness\"100 and the Claimant has framed in terms of efficiency, fairness and proportionality.101\n\nInternational Court of Justice, Rules of Court, Article 79(5).\n\nEmphasis added.\n\nBifurcation Request, \u00b6 204.\n\nObservations, *inter alia,* at \u00b6\u00b6 4 and 57.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that it should have regard to all relevant circumstances and be guided in its assessment by considerations of economy, efficiency and fairness. Amongst the issues to which it ought to have regard are (a) whether the Respondent's objections appear closely linked to the merits of the claim such that the Tribunal may only be sufficiently informed of the issues in the course of the proceedings on the merits, (b) whether the objections appear capable of disposing of the entirety of the Claimant's case, and (c) whether bifurcation would be procedurally efficient in the circumstances of the case, both in terms of time and cost, or, alternatively, whether bifurcation may prolong the proceedings and add to the Parties' costs, whether for reason of dismissal of the objections or joinder of the objections to the merits of the proceedings.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal is required to make its assessment on the basis of the Parties' submissions to date, which in this case includes notably the Claimant's Memorial, the Bifurcation Request and the Parties' subsequent pleadings on the Bifurcation Request.\n\n76.\n\nHaving regard to these pleadings, the Tribunal is not in a position to conclude, and does not consider, that any of the objections advanced by the Respondent is either frivolous or otherwise self-evidently lacking in merit. An appreciation of whether such an evaluation is warranted, as is urged by the Claimant, will have to await a considered assessment in due course. Nothing in the Tribunal's decision to reject the Respondent's request for bifurcation should thus be taken as reflecting a view that any objection does not properly warrant careful scrutiny.\n\n77.\n\nThis said, having regard to the Parties' submissions, the Tribunal considers that bifurcation is neither warranted nor appropriate in the circumstances of the case for three reasons. The first is that, on the basis of its appreciation from the Parties' submissions to date, it appears to the Tribunal that it is only likely to be sufficiently informed of the issues, to enable it to take a considered decision on the Respondent\u2019s objections, in the course of the proceedings on the merits of the case. For example, it appears to the Tribunal that a considered assessment would properly require the Tribunal to have a clear appreciation of the steps taken by the Claimant and its subsidiary in the PRC to challenge the measures of which the Claimant complains before the PRC authorities. This goes to both jurisdiction and merits, and may be expected to turn on questions of evidence.\n\n78.\n\nThis appreciation of linkage to the merits, even if to a different extent, for purposes of enabling the Tribunal to be sufficiently informed of the issues requiring decision, seems to arise in respect of each of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction. And, as noted above, the objection to admissibility is contingent on the objections to jurisdiction, rather than being an elaborated and independent objection.\n\n79.\n\nThe second reason for the Tribunal\u2019s decision, related to the first, is that, having regard to the preceding appreciation, the Tribunal considers that bifurcation is unlikely to be procedurally efficient in terms of both time and cost. Particularly having regard to the likely requirement for evidence, a bifurcated procedure to address the substance of the Respondent\u2019s objections would likely require an extended procedure in circumstances in which the Tribunal is not now in a position to conclude that there is a preponderant likelihood that the outcome of such a preliminary procedure would be dismissal of the Claimant\u2019s case at that preliminary stage. In such circumstances, bifurcation would add to the Parties\u2019 commitment of time and cost, rather than reduce it. In contrast, the Tribunal considers that the procedural schedule that is already in place pursuant to PO#1, that will follow this decision on bifurcation, will enable the issues to be efficiently addressed.\n\n80.\n\nThe third reason for the Tribunal\u2019s decision is that any disadvantage or hardship to the Respondent in consequence of joining the Respondent\u2019s objections to the merits would be adequately and appropriately addressed by an award of costs were the Tribunal to conclude in due course that any of the Respondent\u2019s objections were well founded. In the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal considers that the balance of economy, efficiency and fairness favours joining the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections to the merits, where they can be fully considered in light of all the evidence.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n81.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(a) the Respondent's request for the proceedings to be bifurcated to enable its objections to jurisdiction and admissibility to be addressed at a preliminary phase is denied;\n\n(b) the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility are joined to the proceedings on the merits;\n\n(c) Alternative Schedule 2 of Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1 shall apply to the proceedings going forward; and\n\n(d) the issue of costs in connection with the request for bifurcation is deferred for consideration at a later stage."}, {"Title": "Procedural Order No. 4 (Reasoned Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request to Amend the Request for Arbitration)", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2019-05-15T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Procedural Order No. 4 (Reasoned Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Request to Amend the Request for Arbitration)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 2 May 2017, the Claimant filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID (\"**Request for Arbitration**\"). The ICSID Secretariat acknowledged receipt of the Request for Arbitration and transmitted it to Respondent that same day. On 4 May 2017, the Secretariat sent the Claimant a list of questions relating to the Request for Arbitration.\n\n2.\n\nOn 9 May 2017, the Claimant\u2019s then counsel, Dentons LLP in Beijing, informed ICSID that it had withdrawn and would no longer represent the Claimant in the arbitration. On 6 June 2017, Dr. Florian Dupuy and Dr. Joseph Schwartz, of Wagner Arbitration in Berlin, informed ICSID that the Claimant had retained their firm to represent it in these proceedings.\n\n3.\n\nBy letter of 19 June 2017, the Claimant provided its responses to the Secretariat\u2019s questions of 4 May 2017. On 21 June 2017, the Respondent filed comments on the Claimant\u2019s responses. Later that day, the ICSID Secretary-General registered the Request for Arbitration and notified the Parties.\n\n4.\n\nOn 4 December 2017, the Claimant filed an application for provisional measures. The Parties subsequently filed two rounds of written submission addressing that application. In its submissions, the Claimant indicated that it would be seeking an additional form of relief not mentioned in the Request for Arbitration. In addition, the Claimant\u2019s submissions suggested that its underlying case might be broader in scope than that set forth in the Request for Arbitration.\n\n5.\n\nOn 8 January 2018, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n6.\n\nThe first session was held on 1 February 2018 by teleconference. During the first session, in response to a question from the President of the Tribunal, the Claimant confirmed that it was planning to file an application to amend its request for relief set forth in the Request for Arbitration. The President noted that such an application would need to be filed in an expeditious fashion.\n\n7.\n\nFollowing the first session, an audio recording and written transcript of the teleconference were provided to the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n8.\n\nOn 26 February 2018, the Claimant filed what it described as \"Clarifications to the Request for Arbitration\" by which it applied to clarify and/or amend certain aspects of its Request for Arbitration. Notwithstanding its title, this constituted an application by the Claimant, through its new counsel of record, to be permitted to extensively revise and extend the Claimant\u2019s original Request for Arbitration. For purposes of its analysis and decision, the Tribunal accordingly describes the Claimant\u2019s 26 February 2018 application as the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration Revision Request (\"**RfA Revision Request**\").\n\n9.\n\nOn 9 March 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.1 addressing the procedural organisation of the arbitration.\n\n10.\n\nPursuant to the invitation of the Tribunal, on 22 March 2018, the Respondent filed its Observations on the Claimant\u2019s Application to Amend the Request for Arbitration (\"**Observations**\").\n\n11.\n\nBy letter from the Tribunal Secretary of 10 April 2018, the Tribunal communicated to the Parties its decision accepting the Claimant\u2019s RfA Revision Request, together with summary reasons for so doing. The present Procedural Order sets out the Tribunal\u2019s fully reasoned and elaborated Decision, reflecting the conclusions contained in the Tribunal\u2019s letter of 10 April 2018.\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s letter of 10 April 2018 also communicated to the Parties the Tribunal\u2019s decision, and summary reasons therefor, denying the Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures. The Tribunal\u2019s fully reasoned and elaborated decision on the Claimant\u2019s provisional measures request was subsequently addressed in Procedural Order No.2 of 10 August 2018.\n\n13.\n\nOn 17 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.3 denying the Respondent\u2019s request for the proceedings to be bifurcated to enable its objections to jurisdiction and admissibility to be addressed at a preliminary phase. By that Procedural Order, the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility were joined to the proceedings in the merits.\n\n**II. THE REQUESTED CLARIFICATIONS AND AMENDMENTS**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal (a) provides an overview of the Claimant\u2019s case as pleaded in the Request for Arbitration, and (b) identifies the amendments the Claimant seeks to make to its case.\n\n**A. The Request for Arbitration**\n----------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nIn the Request for Arbitration, the Claimant invokes the Agreement between the Federal Republic of Germany and the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (the \"**BIT**\") as the Respondent\u2019s written consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n16.\n\nThe dispute described in the Request for Arbitration arises out of the Claimant\u2019s alleged investment in the People\u2019s Republic of China (the \"**PRC**\") through a wholly owned subsidiary, Ji\u2019nan Hela Schwarz Food Co., Ltd. (\"**JHSF**\"), which was established in 1996.1 In 2001, JHSF was granted the legal right to use a parcel of state-owned industrial land in Shandong Province (the \"**Land**\") for 50 years, until 29 July 2051.2 After receiving this right, JHSF built a series of buildings on 4821.18 square meters of the Land (the \"**Buildings**\").3\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 8. The dispute is summarised in the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2, which addresses Claimant\u2019s request for provisional measures. Only the main points are recalled in this section.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 9; **Exhibit C-1**, The People\u2019s Republic of China State-Owned Land Use Certificate, 2001.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 10.\n\n17.\n\nOn 11 September 2014, the Jinan Municipal Government issued a Housing Expropriation Decision to expropriate the Land and the Buildings (the \"**Expropriation Decision**\").4 JHSF challenged the Expropriation Decision through an administrative process of the Shandong Provincial Government,5 and then through a lawsuit against the Jinan Municipal Government at the Intermediate People's Court.6 None of these challenges was successful.7\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 11.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 12; **Exhibit C-2**, Application for Administrative Review, 2 July 2014.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 13; **Exhibit C-4**, Administrative Complaint, 3 May 2016.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13; **Exhibit C-3**, Administrative Reconsideration Decision, The People's Government of Shandong Province, 15 April 2015; **Exhibit C-5**, Administrative Ruling, Shandong Jinan Intermediate People's Court, 19 July 2016; **Exhibit C-6**, Administrative Ruling, Shandong Higher People's Court, 6 December 2016.\n\n18.\n\nIn August 2016, the Jinan Municipal Government issued a Housing Expropriation Compensation Decision, in which it offered to pay compensation to JHSF in the amount of Rmb 32,954,380 (about US$ 5 million).8\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 14; **Exhibit C-7**, Expropriation Compensation Decision No. 5, Jinan Municipal Government, 29 August 2016.\n\n19.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration states that the Claimant \"strongly objects to the expropriation and compensation believing [that] the expropriation is illegitimate and the compensation amount has been largely undervalued\".9 The Claimant alleges that the expropriation was not carried out for the public benefit, and that the compensation offered in the Compensation Decision was much lower (on a per meter basis) than the price of four other expropriated pieces of surrounding land. In this regard, the Request for Arbitration refers to Article 9 of the BIT (\"Expropriation and Compensation\").\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 15.\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimant formulated its request for relief in the Request for Arbitration as follows:\n\n\"a) ORDER that the Respondent pay justifiable expropriation compensation;\n\nb) ORDER that the Respondent pay all costs of this arbitration, including the lodging fee, all fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and all costs and expenses incurred by the Claimant in prosecuting these proceedings, including legal fees, internal management costs, and all associated expenses;\n\nc) ORDER any further or other relieves as the Tribunal in its discretion sees fit.\"10\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 36.\n\n21.\n\nThe Request for Arbitration further states:\n\n\"Hela reserves its right to supplement, expand upon, or amend the factual and legal claims, arguments and evidence it has submitted in the present Request in the course of the arbitral proceedings, consistent with the ICSID Convention and other Rules and directions by the Tribunal.\"11\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 37.\n\n**B. Requested Clarifications and Amendments**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimant states that the claims set forth in the Request for Arbitration must be clarified and expanded upon. The Claimant seeks to amend the Request for Arbitration to include the following allegations:\n\na. The expropriation described in the Request for arbitration was an *unlawful* expropriation. Thus, \"the dispute is not solely about the determination of the amount of proper compensation for the Expropriation, but also about the lawfulness of the Expropriation\".12\n\nb. There was both a direct and an indirect expropriation. The direct expropriation of JHSF\u2019s land-use right and the demolition of its Buildings resulted in an indirect expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s business in the PRC.13\n\nc. The Respondent\u2019s actions breached its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimant\u2019s investment under Article 3 of the BIT.14\n\nd. The Respondent\u2019s actions were contrary to Article 2 of the BIT, which sets forth the Respondent\u2019s duty in to refrain from taking any arbitrary or discriminatory measures against the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and disposal of the Claimant\u2019s investment.15\n\ne. The Respondent may have failed to accord the same level of treatment to the Claimant's investment as to the investments of Chinese investors, in violation of Article 3 of the BIT.16\n\nf. The Respondent breached its procedural duties, including the obligation to refrain from aggravating the dispute while arbitration proceedings are pending, by allowing local authorities to take over and demolish JHSF's premises in December 2017.17\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6 9\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6 17.\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6 17.\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6 18.\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\n23.\n\nWith regard to the relief requested, the Claimant now seeks relief beyond compensation based on the fair market value of the Land, as stated in the Request for Arbitration. In particular, the Claimant now requests restitution of its rights and damages for the loss in value of its investment. The Claimant indicates that the amendments will \"result in a considerable increase as compared to the figures mentioned in the Request for Arbitration\".18\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6 21.\n\n24.\n\nAccording to its expanded request for relief in the RfA Revision Request, the Claimant intends to seek:\n\n\"(a) A declaration that the Respondent has breached Article 4 of the BIT by unlawfully expropriating the Claimants' investment;\n\n(b) A declaration that the Respondent has breached Articles 2 and 3 of the BIT;\n\n(c) A declaration that the Respondent has breached its procedural duties by deliberately aggravating the dispute while these proceedings were pending;\n\n(d) Restitution of Jinan Hela Schwarz's land-use right and damages for the loss of value of its investment caused by the physical taking of its premises by the Chinese authorities;\n\n(e) Alternatively, if restitution is no longer possible, full reparation, i.e. compensation for the expropriation of the land-use right and damages for the loss of value of the Claimant\u2019s investment, including lost profits.\"19\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6 22.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant states that its formal request for relief in the Memorial shall not be limited by the statements in the RfA Revision Request, and that it reserves the right to claim moral damages.20\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. The Claimant set out the following request for relief in \u00b6 545 of its Memorial dated 29 June 2018: \"the Claimant respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal issue an award: (a) DECLARING that the Respondent has breached Articles 3(1), 4(2) and 9 of the Treaty; (b) ORDERING the Respondent to fully repair the loss it has caused to the Claimant by, *either,* ORDERING the restitution of the entirety of the Claimant\u2019s investment, in particular by the grant of a new production facility of the same value, *or, alternatively,* ORDERING the Respondent to pay the Claimant a sum exceeding EUR 25,000,000.00 including pre-award interest, or such other sum as the Tribunal determines will ensure full reparation of the Claimant\u2019s loss; (c) ORDERING the Respondent to pay post-award interest in an amount yet to be determined; (d) AWARDING such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate; and (e) ORDERING the Respondent to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration, including the Claimant\u2019s legal and expert fees, the fees and expenses of any experts appointed by the Tribunal, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and ICSID\u2019s costs.\"\n\n26.\n\nFinally, the Claimant identifies corrections to clerical errors in paragraphs 9 and 25 of the Request for Arbitration.21\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6\u00b6 25-29.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimant\u2019s RfA Revision Request**\n------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the purpose of the RfA Revision Request is to \"provide some clarifications as to the scope of the Claimant\u2019s claims\" so that the Tribunal has a more accurate understanding of the dispute \"for purposes of procedural planning\".22\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 4.\n\n28.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it is not seeking to redefine the subject matter of the dispute identified in the Request for Arbitration. Rather, its expanded claims arise out of the same measures taken by the Respondent\u2019s authorities in relation to the expropriation of the Land and Buildings beginning in 2014, which Claimant raised in the Request for Arbitration.23 While the RfA Revision Request refers to events that occurred *after* the Request for Arbitration (namely, the physical taking and demolition of JHSF's premises by authorities in December 2017), the Claimant considers these events to be a \"continuation\" of the behaviour discussed in the Request for Arbitration.24\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6 6.\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 14, 17, 20.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimant sees no reason why the clarifications and amendments to the Request for Arbitration would not be permitted. In the Claimant's view, a request for arbitration need not contain a full description of the claimant's case or even a request for relief.25 The Claimant cites ICSID Institutional Rule 2, which sets out the required contents of a request for arbitration.26 The only information required with respect to the substance of the dispute is \"information concerning the issues in dispute indicating that there is, between the parties, a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\".\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6 3.\n\nRfA Revision Request, \u00b6 3.\n\nB. **The Respondent\u2019s Observations**\n------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent asks the Tribunal to deny the Claimant's request to amend the Request for Arbitration. Its position is summarised as follows:\n\n\"While labelling its application a *\"clarification\",* the Claimant has essentially rewritten its Request for Arbitration by changing its factual assertions, legal theory, quantification and request for relief almost a year into this arbitration. These sweeping and unpredictable changes are an invitation to undermine the integrity and orderly conduct of these proceedings.\"27\n\nObservations, \u00b6 7.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that a request for arbitration does not have to state the claimant's claims in full.28 However, in the Respondent's view, the request for arbitration is a fundamental step in an ICSID proceeding which \"defines the scope of the dispute\".29 It provides the Secretary-General with the information needed to screen requests in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. It also allows the respondent to begin preparing its defence against the claimant\u2019s case. In addition, it is the basis on which the tribunal is selected and the initial procedural directions are formulated.30\n\nObservations, \u00b6 14.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 14.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 15.\n\n32.\n\nThe Respondent observes that there is limited binding authority regarding how an ICSID tribunal should assess a party\u2019s request to \"re-plead\" its case after the request for arbitration.31 Yet the Respondent points to certain general principles that it considers relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the Application, including the following:\n\na. Tribunals must conduct proceedings properly, fairly and efficiently.\n\nb. A claimant has a duty \"to bring forward its whole case and not reveal or modify this piecemeal as it sees fit\".32\n\nc. Respondents have an expectation that the case they are defending against will not change without good reason.\n\nd. In accordance with the principle of equality of arms, any prejudice caused by permitting the amendment must be outweighed by the prejudice of excluding the amendment.33\n\ne. Amendments should be permitted only when necessary to ensure that the real dispute between the parties can be adjudicated. They should be excluded when \"motivated by tactical considerations or attempts to improve upon earlier unwillingness or a lack of reasonable diligence\".34\n\nObservations, \u00b6 10.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 11.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 11.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 12.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant bears the \"heavy burden\" of demonstrating that the requested amendments are justified in light of these principles.35 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant has failed to meet this burden for three main reasons.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 13.\n\n34.\n\nFirst, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has not offered a satisfactory explanation for any of the requested amendments. With regard to the addition of restitution to the Claimant\u2019s request for relief, the Respondent suspects that this was no more than a tactical move employed by the Claimant to bolster its request for provisional measures.36 Further, according to the Respondent, the Claimant has offered no justification for the various other amendments identified in the RfA Revision Request, even though each of these amendments must be assessed on its own merits.37\n\nObservations, \u00b6 20.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 21.\n\n35.\n\nSecond, the Respondent argues that it would suffer serious injustice if the RfA Revision Request were granted, which could not be fully compensable by a costs award in its favour.38 For example, the Respondent would be deprived of the opportunity to object to the new claims under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) because the applicable deadline has expired. In addition, the Respondent was not able to reply to the new issues in its submissions on provisional measures. More generally, the changes would impede the Respondent\u2019s preparations for this arbitration.39 The Respondent states that, as a result, granting the amendments would \"[a]t the very least, [] require further pleadings and, most likely, evidence collection and presentation\".40\n\nObservations, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 24.\n\nObservations, \u00b6 22.\n\n36.\n\nThird, the Respondent considers the RfA Revision Request is \"inappropriately vague and unspecific\", such that the Respondent is unable to \"consider further arguments in response to the Claimant\u2019s present application, including estoppel or waiver\".41\n\nObservations, \u00b6 25.\n\n37.\n\nThus, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n\"(1) REFUSE the Claimant\u2019s application for permission to amend its Request for Arbitration; and\n\n(2) ORDER the Claimant to bear all costs incurred in connection with this application.\"42\n\nObservations, \u00b6 33.\n\n**IV. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n-------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal has given careful consideration to the Parties' submissions. As noted above, the Tribunal's decision on the Claimant's RfA Revision Request, including the reasons therefor set out in summary form, was communicated to the Parties by correspondence from the Secretary of the Tribunal dated 10 April 2018. This Procedural Order reflects that correspondence and constitutes the fully elaborated Decision of the Tribunal.\n\n39.\n\nOf material relevance to the assessment of the RfA Revision Request, Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide as follows:\n\n**Article 46, ICSID Convention**\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"\n\n**Rule 40, Ancillary Claims**\n\n\"(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counter-claim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorises the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceedings.\n\n(3) The Tribunal shall fix a time limit within which the party against which an ancillary claim is presented may file its written observations thereon.\"\n\n40.\n\nIt follows from these provisions that incidental or additional claims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute are presumptively admissible provided they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and otherwise within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. In such circumstances, and subject to timely procedural notification, the Tribunal \"shall\" determine such claims.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant\u2019s new counsel of record signalled at an early stage, after having been appointed, that the Claimant would be seeking an additional form of relief not mentioned in the Request for Arbitration. The RfA Revision Request was thereafter made reasonably expeditiously, on 22 February 2018, following the first procedural hearing on 1 February 2018, and before Procedural Order No.1 was issued on 9 March 2018. The RfA Revision Request was accordingly made before the submission of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the RfA Revision Request was made in a timely manner.\n\n42.\n\nAs noted in Section II above, the scope of the Claimant\u2019s proposed revisions is extensive. The Claimant seeks to enlarge the ambit of its case beyond the claim of expropriation advanced in the original Request for Arbitration to include claims of discriminatory treatment and for breach of the fair and equitable treatment provisions of the BIT, as well as claims alleging a breach of procedural duties by the Respondent in consequence of the demolition of the Claimant\u2019s JHSF premises during the pendency of this arbitration.\n\n43.\n\nThe first question to consider is whether the Claimant\u2019s proposed extensive revisions of its Request for Arbitration constitute incidental or additional claims that can properly be said to arise directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute. If they are, the Claimant is entitled to advance such claims, provided that it does so in a timely procedural manner, and the Tribunal is required to determine those claims. If, however, the proposed revisions cannot properly be said to arise directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, or if they were not notified in a timely procedural manner, the matter would fall to be considered by reference to general principles of procedural fairness and efficiency governing the conduct of the arbitration, having regard, *inter alia,* to Articles 41, 44 and 46 of the ICSID Convention, and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n44.\n\nAlthough the proposed revisions are extensive, the Tribunal considers that they are properly to be regarded as additional claims arising directly from the subject-matter of the dispute. Notwithstanding the scope of the proposed revisions, they would not, if admitted, transform the dispute into one of a fundamentally different nature to that of which the Tribunal is already seised, in the sense of going beyond the subject-matter of the original Request for Arbitration, as opposed to adding new legal claims. The Tribunal considers therefore that the proposed revisions come within the implicit scope of Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules in that they are to be construed as ancillary claims that the Claimant would be entitled to advance and that the Tribunal would be expected to determine in the normal course of the exercise of its functions.\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it would suffer serious injustice if the proposed revision of the Request for Arbitration were to be accepted and that to do so would undermine the integrity and orderly conduct of these proceedings.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that the RfA Revision Request was made at an early stage, and before the submission of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial, and that, as such, accepting the request would give rise to little, if any, disadvantage, cost or inconvenience to the Respondent. The Tribunal notes further that denying the Claimant\u2019s RfA Revision Request would have the effect of requiring the Claimant to submit a fresh request for arbitration notifying the new legal claims in a manner that would not be in the interests of an efficient and effective adjudicatory procedure.\n\n47.\n\nIt follows from the preceding that, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the proposed revision of the Request for Arbitration would not alter the character of the claim submitted by the Claimant, for the reason that the proposed revisions address additional claims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, and that it was notified in a timely manner, such as would neither give rise to material, if any, hardship or disadvantage to the Respondent nor undermine the integrity or orderly conduct of the arbitration proceedings. For completeness, the Tribunal considers that general principles of procedural fairness and efficiency governing the conduct of the arbitration in any event militate in favour of acceptance of the RfA Revision Request.\n\n48.\n\nThe preceding notwithstanding, there remains to be considered the question of whether the Claimant\u2019s proposed revisions come \"within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre\", as stated in Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules regarding the determination of ancillary claims.\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent, in email correspondence to the ICSID Secretariat dated 21 June 2017, before the Tribunal was constituted on 8 January 2018, raised certain objections which were jurisdictional in character. The fact of these objections was addressed in \u00a716 of Procedural Order No.1, adopted on 9 March 2018, which established a procedure in respect of objections to jurisdiction and/or admissibility, whether subject to a request that they be heard as a preliminary matter or that fell to be addressed as part of the proceedings on the merits. The Respondent thus indicated at an early stage, before the Claimant\u2019s RfA Revision Request, albeit only in headline terms at that point, that it contested the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and, implicitly, that it would be submitting preliminary objections to jurisdiction.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the requirement in Article 46 of the ICSID Convention that the Tribunal \"shall... determine\" any additional claims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute \"provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre\" does not impose a threshold test for the admission of additional claims, by way of revision of a request for arbitration, that otherwise meets the requirement of \"arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute\". Rather, it addresses the Tribunal\u2019s substantive determination of the merits of such claims.\n\n51.\n\nThis being the case, the Tribunal considers that the fact or actuality of objections to jurisdiction cannot operate as a bar to the revision of a request for arbitration. Equally, however, the admission of the Claimant's proposed revisions to its Request for Arbitration cannot prejudice the Respondent's latitude to raise objections to jurisdiction or admissibility.\n\n52.\n\nIn its letter to the Parties of 10 April 2018 communicating its decision to accept the Claimant's RfA Revision Request, the Tribunal noted that its decision was without prejudice to any objection to jurisdiction or preliminary objection that the Respondent may wish to advance. Although these developments post-dated the Tribunal decision as communicated in its letter of 10 April 2018, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent, in accordance with the procedural timetable established in Procedural Order No.1, submitted a Memorial on Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation (\"Bifurcation Request\") on 1 October 2018. By that Bifurcation Request, the Respondent raised four objections to jurisdiction and one objection to the admissibility of the claim.\n\n53.\n\nFollowing the Parties' submissions, the Tribunal, in Procedural Order No.3 of 17 December 2018, denied the Respondent's Bifurcation Request and joined the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and admissibility to the proceedings on the merits. For the avoidance of doubt, those objections remain for determination by the Tribunal, as would any objections going to jurisdiction or admissibility that may properly be advanced as the proceedings progress.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n54.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. The Claimant\u2019s application to revise its Request for Arbitration as set out in its RfA Revision Request is granted.\n\nb. The Tribunal defers any question of costs in connection with the RfA Revision Request for consideration at a later stage."}]}
