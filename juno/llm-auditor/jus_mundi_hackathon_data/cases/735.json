PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn December 28, 2001, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"Centre\") received from LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp., and LG&E International Inc., juridical persons constituted under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, United States of America (\"Claimants\" or \"LG&E\"), a Request for Arbitration dated December 21, 2001, against the Argentine Republic (\"Respondent\").\n\n2.\n\nIn the Request Claimants assert that they hold investments in gas-distribution licensees in Argentina and that Respondent unilaterally decided to freeze certain automatic semi-annual adjustments, based on changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index (\"PPI\"), to the tariffs for distribution of natural gas in Argentina. Claimants further assert that in taking these actions, Respondent breached its obligations under the Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the United States of America Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment (\"Bilateral Treaty\"): (i) by failing to honor commitments made by Respondent when it induced the Claimants (and their predecessors in interest) to make investments in the Argentine gas industry; (ii) by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to Claimants\u2019 investment; (iii) by taking arbitrary measures that discriminate against the Claimants on the basis of their foreign nationality and ownership and that impair the use enjoyment of the Claimants\u2019 investment; and (iv) by indirectly expropriating the Claimants\u2019 investment without complying with the requirements of the Bilateral Treaty, including due process of law and payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation. The Claimants rely in particular on Article 11(1), (2) and (6) and Article IV of the Bilateral Treaty. They seek corresponding relief.\n\n3.\n\nAs regards the jurisdiction of ICSID, the Claimants refer in their Request to Article VII of the Bilateral Treaty and Article 25 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\" or \"Convention\") to which both Argentina and the United States of America are a Party.\n\n4.\n\nOn January 24, 2002, the Claimants submitted to the Centre a letter supplementing their Request for Arbitration of December 21, 2001. In that letter, the Claimants assert that the Respondent had broadened its breach of the Bilateral Treaty by abolishing the tariff adjustments altogether and other changes implemented in the Public Emergency and Exchange Regime Reform Law, Law No. 25 561 of 7 January 2002 (the \"Emergency Law\").\n\n5.\n\nOn January 31, 2002, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, and, pursuant to Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"Institution Rules\"), notified the parties of the registration of the request and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nThe parties then agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal was to be constituted by three (3) arbitrators, one appointed by the Claimants, the second appointed by the Argentine Republic, and the third, who would preside over the Tribunal, appointed by the Secretary-General of the Centre in accordance with the procedure adopted by the parties. On 20 June 2002, the Claimants appointed Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of the Netherlands, as an arbitrator for the present case. This appointment was confirmed by the Claimants through their letters to the Centre dated August 15 and 28, 2002. The Argentine Republic, through a letter received on August 26, 2002, appointed Judge Francisco Rezek, a national of Brazil, as an arbitrator. On November 7, 2002, the Secretary-General of the Centre appointed, with the agreement of the parties, Dr. Tatiana B. de Maekelt, a national of Venezuela, as President of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn November 13, 2002, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the parties that all arbitrators had accepted their appointment and that the Tribunal was deemed to be constituted on November 13, 2002. On the same date, in accordance with Regulation 25 of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, he informed the parties that Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson was to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n8.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 13(1) of the Arbitration Rules, the First Session of the Tribunal with the parties was held, after consultation with them, on December 19, 2002, at ICSID seat in Washington, D.C. At that session, the parties expressed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and stated that they had no objection to the appointment, under the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules, of any of the members of the Tribunal. It was put on record that the proceedings were to be carried out in accordance with the provisions of Article 44 of the ICSID Convention and under the Arbitration Rules in force since September 26, 1984.\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimants were represented at the First Session by the following persons:\n\nOscar M. Garibaldi, counsel, Covington & Burlington, Washington, D.C.  \nEugene D. Gulland, counsel, Covington & Burlington, Washington, D.C.  \nHoracio J. Ruiz Moreno, Hope, Duggan & Silva, Buenos Aires\n\nAlso attending on behalf of the Claimants:\n\nDorothy O\u2019Brien, Deputy Corporate Counsel, LG&E Energy Corp.\n\n10.\n\nThe Respondent was represented at the First Session by the following persons:\n\nIgnacio Su\u00e1rez Anzorena, Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires  \nCarlos Lo Turco, Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires\n\nActing on the instruction of Rub\u00e9n Miguel Citara, Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires.\n\n11.\n\nAt the First Session, the parties expressed their agreement on various procedural aspects, as recorded in the minutes of the session, signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. During the First Session, after hearing both parties, the Arbitral Tribunal established the following schedule for the written submissions relating to the case. The Claimants were to file a Memorial on May 31, 2003. Once the Memorial had been received from the Claimants, the Respondent could choose one of the following schedules: submit an answer within 60 days or, alternatively, submit an answer within 90 days. In its answer, the Respondent could file an objection to jurisdiction and include, if appropriate, a pleading on the merits. If the Respondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Claimants were required to submit a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction within 30 days following receipt of the relevant Memorial submitted by the Respondent; subsequently, the Respondent were to file its Reply within 20 days from the receipt of the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction; and the Claimants were to file their Rejoinder within 20 days from receipt of the Reply submitted by the Respondent.\n\n12.\n\nThe following schedule was also established: If the Respondent chose the 60-day time limit for its answer, and if the Tribunal agreed, a hearing on jurisdiction could be held on September 22-23, 2003. If the Respondent chose the 90-day time limit for its answer, the hearing on jurisdiction could be held on October 20-21, 2003, if the Tribunal agreed. The hearing on the merits would be held on March 8-12, 2004.\n\n13.\n\nOn March 31, 2003, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the merits. The Memorial sets forth the following relief sought by the Claimants:\n\n(i) Declaring that the Respondent has breached its obligations under Article II(2)(c) of the Treaty by failing to observe obligations that it entered into with regard to the Claimants\u2019 investment;\n\n(ii) Declaring that the Respondent has breached its obligations under Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty by failing to accord to the Claimant\u2019s investment fair and equitable treatment and by according treatment less than that required by international law;\n\n(iii) Declaring that the Respondent has breached its obligations under Article II(2)(b) of the Treaty by taking arbitrary and discriminatory measures that impair the use and enjoyment of the Claimants\u2019 investment;\n\n(iv) Declaring that the Respondent has breached Article IV(1) of the Treaty by indirectly expropriating the Claimants\u2019 investment without complying with the requirements of the Treaty, including observance of due process of law and payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation;\n\n(v) Ordering the Respondent to pay the Claimants full compensation in the amounts set forth in this Memorial, plus pre- and post-award compound interest;\n\n(vi) Ordering the Respondent to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the cost of the Claimants\u2019 legal representation, plus interest thereon in accordance with the Treaty; and\n\n(vii) Such other or additional relief as may be appropriate under the Treaty or may otherwise be just and proper.\n\n14.\n\nSubsequently, the parties decided by mutual agreement to modify the schedule of proceedings on the objection to jurisdiction, and the Respondent so notified the Secretariat of the Centre on July 1, 2003, as did the Claimants on July 2, 2003. The time limits were thus fixed as follows: Memorial on Jurisdiction, July 21, 2003; Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, August 29, 2003; Reply on Jurisdiction, September 22, 2003; and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, October 13, 2003.\n\n15.\n\nIt was also agreed that the hearing on jurisdiction was to be held on October 20-21, 2003. The Tribunal, in agreement with the parties, subsequently decided that the hearing on jurisdiction was to be held on November 20-21, 2003, at The Hague, Netherlands.\n\n16.\n\nOn July 21, 2003, in accordance with the agreed time limits, the Respondent formally raised an objection to the jurisdiction of ICSID in its Memorial on Jurisdiction, setting forth the arguments on which it based that objection, and attaching documentation supporting its contentions. On August 29, 2003, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. On September 22, 2003, the Argentine Republic submitted its Reply to the Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, and on October 14, 2003, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder.\n\n17.\n\nOn October 30, 2003, the Respondent addressed a request for suspension of the proceedings in the present case, and requested in the alternative that the hearing on jurisdiction be postponed. On October 31, the President of the Arbitral Tribunal invited the Claimants to file their observations on this request by November 3, 2003. On November 3, 2003, the Claimants objected to the requested suspension. On November 5, 2003, the members of the Arbitral Tribunal deliberated on the Argentine Republic\u2019s request. The same day, both parties were notified of the Tribunal\u2019s decision not to suspend the present proceeding and of its refusal to postpone the hearing on jurisdiction scheduled for November 20-21, 2003.\n\n18.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction was held on the above-mentioned date at the headquarters of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, Netherlands. Eugene D. Gulland and Oscar M. Garibaldi, of the law firm Covington & Burling, Washington, D.C., addressed the Tribunal as representatives of the Claimants. Also present at the hearing was Dorothy O\u2019Brien, Deputy General Counsel of LG&E, and S. Bradford Rives, Chief Financial Officer of LG&E Energy Corp. Carlos Ignacio Su\u00e1rez Anzorena and Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9s, Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, acting on the instruction of Horacio Daniel Rosatti, Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, addressed the Tribunal as representatives of the Argentine Republic. Likewise, the Claimant\u2019s side presented its oral arguments in response to the Respondent\u2019s side, and the Respondent\u2019s side stated its pleas in response to the Claimant\u2019s side. The Tribunal put questions to the parties in accordance with Rule 32(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n**II. FACTS AND CONTENTIONS OF THE PARTIES REGARDING JURISDICTION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nIn the present case, claims were submitted by LG&E, companies constituted in the United States of America that operate in that country and others, against the Argentine Republic to ICSID under the Bilateral Treaty. LG&E holds shares in three gas distribution licensees constituted in Argentina: Distribuidora de Gas del Centro (\"Centro\"), Distribuidora de Gas Cuyana S.A. (\"Cuyana\"), and Gas Natural BAN S.A. (\"GasBan\"), hereinafter collectively referred to as \"Licensees.\"\n\n20.\n\nBoth the Argentine Republic and the United States of America are parties to the ICSID Convention, which was ratified by the Argentine Republic in 1994 and by the United States of America in 1966.\n\n21.\n\nLikewise, both States signed the Bilateral Treaty in Washington, DC, on November 14, 1991, which has been in force since October 20, 1994.\n\n22.\n\nThe dispute from which the claims in the present proceedings arise is related to the privatization process by the Argentine Republic, started in 1989, of the national gas monopoly, Gas del Estado. Its equipment and facilities were transferred to newly created local companies (amongst whom Centro, Cuyana and GasBan) that were granted licenses for the transport and distribution of natural gas. The shares in the local companies were sold to private investors.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has discontinued the guaranteed PPI (U.S. Producer Price Index) adjustments and other tariff increases since 1999. Moreover, the so-called Emergency Law of January 2002 eliminated the currency protection (computation of tariffs in U.S. dollars before conversion in pesos) and inflation protection (the automatic PPI conversion). Furthermore, the Respondent devalued the peso by amending the Convertibility Law which had established a fixed 1:1 relationship between the peso and the U.S. dollar. These and other measures of the Respondent amounted, according to the Claimants, to breaches by the Respondent of its obligations under the Bilateral Treaty.\n\n24.\n\nThe Government announced the opening of the renegotiation process for public service contracts on February 12, 2002, and, by Decree 293/02, the Minister of the Economy was made responsible for this process, for which a Renegotiation Commission was established.\n\n25.\n\nWith regard to jurisdiction, the Claimants assert that ICSID arbitration is their chosen option under the Bilateral Treaty, since the present case deals with an investment dispute and, in accordance with Article VII of the Bilateral Treaty, the Argentine Republic had consented to submit investment disputes to ICSID arbitration. Moreover, the Claimants allege that they have tried without success to resolve this dispute through consultations and negotiation on many occasions before resorting to arbitration, and that the Argentine Republic chose not to respond, stating, through the Attorney General of Argentina, that the Government was not in a position to resolve such a dispute amicably. According to the Claimants, the present dispute arose on August 30, 2000; hence, at the time of the submission of the Request for Arbitration on December 21, 2001, more than six months had elapsed since the date on which the dispute arose, as required in Article VII(3)(a) of the Bilateral Treaty.\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they have complied with Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, since their claims arise directly from their investments in Argentina. This is a dispute, they contend, between the Argentine Republic, which is a State party to the Convention, and LG&E, a national of the United States, another State party.\n\n27.\n\nIn its Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Respondent seeks the following relief:\n\n277. The Argentine requests the Tribunal to issue an award declaring that LG&E\u2019s claims are inadmissible or that the [T]ribunal lacks jurisdiction over LG&E\u2019s claim.\n\n278. It is also requested that LG&E be ordered to pay all the costs of these proceedings, including the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses, and the costs of the Argentine Republic legal counsel, as well as any other cost incurred in by the Argentine Republic as a result of LG&E\u2019s claim.\n\n28.\n\nIn support of the relief sought, the Respondent raises six objections:\n\n29.\n\nFirst, LG&E lacks standing or *jus standi* in respect of all the disputes it raises:\n\n\u2022 LG&E\u2019s claims can only be brought by the Licensees.\n\n\u2022 Argentine law establishes that shareholders and corporations have a distinct legal personality and does not allow shareholders to file claims for indirect damages.\n\n\u2022 International law recognizes that the shareholders and the company have a distinct personality, and, as a general rule, it precludes claims for indirect damages raised by shareholders.\n\n\u2022 The lack of an express provision in a Treaty cannot be construed as allowing a *jus standi* that is clearly in opposition to national law and incompatible with international law.\n\n30.\n\nSecond, the disputes submitted by LG&E do not arise directly out of an investment as required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention since they are not related to the investment described by LG&E and concern general measures taken by the Argentine Government.\n\n31.\n\nThird, admitting an indirect claim as the one filed by LG&E constitutes a violation of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention regarding nationality and does not qualify under Article VII(8) of the Bilateral Treaty.\n\n32.\n\nFourth, the six months period has not elapsed from the moment the additional dispute was brought and its submission to ICSID arbitration, as provided in the Bilateral Treaty.\n\n33.\n\nFifth, the disputes submitted by LG&E involve the performance or breach of the licenses and belong therefore in the sphere of jurisdictional commitments between the Federal Government and the Licensees.\n\n34.\n\nSixth, the original dispute has already been submitted to the federal courts, and this precludes international arbitration according to the Bilateral Treaty.\n\n35.\n\nIn their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Claimants request the following relief in the form of a Decision on Jurisdiction:\n\n(a) An order that the dispute is within the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal;\n\n(b) An order dismissing all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to the admissibility of the dispute and all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal;\n\n(c) An order that the Respondent pay all costs of the proceedings on jurisdiction, including the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses and the costs of Claimant\u2019s legal representation, subject to interest; and\n\n(d) Such other relief as might be right and proper.\n\n36.\n\nIn support of the relief sought, the Claimants make the following submissions:\n\n37.\n\nFirst, the Claimants are asserting international investment claims under the Bilateral Treaty which are independent of contract claims that might be asserted by the Licensees.\n\n38.\n\nSecond, the Claimants have *jus standi'.*\n\n\u2022 The issues in this case are governed by the Bilateral Treaty and general international law.\n\n\u2022 The Treaty expressly authorizes an investment claim by a shareholder such as LG&E.\n\n\u2022 International jurisprudence upholds the *jus standi* of shareholder investors under BITs.\n\n\u2022 There is no restriction on the *jus standi* of investors that are minority shareholders.\n\n\u2022 The Respondent\u2019s policy arguments against the Claimants\u2019 *jus standi* have no merit.\n\n\u2022 Each of the Claimants is entitled to he protection of the Treaty.\n\n39.\n\nThird, the present dispute arises directly out of an investment.\n\n40.\n\nFourth, Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention is irrelevant to the present proceeding.\n\n41.\n\nFifth, this Tribunal has jurisdiction and competence in respect of the entire proceeding:\n\n\u2022 The so-called \"Original Dispute\" and \"Additional Dispute\" are aspects of a single, continuous dispute.\n\n\u2022 All temporal conditions have been satisfied and the Respondent has suffered no prejudice.\n\n\u2022 The Centre has jurisdiction and the Tribunal has competence to hear the so-called \"Additional Dispute\" as an incidental or additional claim under the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules.\n\n\u2022 Policy considerations favor the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction over the so-called \"Additional Dispute\".\n\n42.\n\nSixth, the jurisdictional provisions of the Licenses are irrelevant to ICSID jurisdiction of this dispute.\n\n43.\n\nSeventh, no aspect of the dispute has been submitted to Argentine jurisdiction.\n\n44.\n\nIn its Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent argues:\n\n(a) The privatization process in the gas industry was carried out in the form of \"national and international biddings.\" In other words, investors were called in general, notwithstanding their nationality. None of the major instruments in the privatization process (public tenders, licenses, transfer contracts) indicates that any kind of recognition of a different \"foreign status\" was ever given to those taking part in the privatization process. The framework of rights and obligations was exactly the same, without any distinction between nationals and foreigners.\n\n(b) It is irrelevant whether the privatization process promoted the use of local holding companies or the use of intermediaries between the Licensees and those aspiring to acquire shares. What the Tribunal must analyze is how the Bilateral Treaty resolves this situation, limiting its scope of operation *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae,* through the definition of the terms \"investor\" and \"investment.\" Neither the Licensees nor the licenses can be included in the scope of application of the Bilateral Treaty.\n\n(c) It is evident that the Tribunal cannot resolve the dispute without first determining the existence and scope of the rights of the Licensees, in accordance with the licenses. A local company may qualify as a foreign investment only if it is owned, or directly or indirectly controlled, by a foreign company. LG&E is only an indirect shareholder, and its direct holdings in the Licensees do not allow it to exercise direct and substantial control over them.\n\n(d) It is true that the privatization process is protected by investment treaties and, in particular, that the investment of LG&E is protected by the Bilateral Treaty, which implies that LG&E is entitled to assert claims for any act attributable to the Argentine Republic that affects its shareholder status. However, it cannot assert rights relating to a license belonging to a third party that does not qualify either as an investment or as an investor under the Treaty.\n\n(e) LG&E invested in a local company that signed an administrative contract governed by Argentine law for the provision of a public service. They are not only trying to use the Bilateral Treaty as an insurance policy against the general economic crisis, but also desire to enrich themselves illegitimately in such a context.\n\n(f) The issue of *jus standi* is not merely a jurisdictional issue, and therefore should not be exclusively decided under the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Treaty. The law applicable to the merits of the dispute should also be applied. Thus, Argentine domestic law is a source that should be taken into account, pursuant to Article 42 of the ICSID Convention. The distinction established under Argentine law between shareholders and corporations, as well as their consequent legal status, has therefore not been modified by the Bilateral Treaty.\n\n(g) The Bilateral Treaty provides that a dispute may be submitted to ICSID for arbitration after six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose and may not have been submitted as part of a previously agreed dispute-settlement procedure. Ignoring this rule, LG&E submitted its request without even reporting the existence of an investment dispute related to the additional dispute, since the Argentine Republic was negotiating the rights relative to the license with its holders, i.e., Centro, Cuyana, and GasBan.\n\n(h) Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the Arbitration Rules require that the dispute be within the scope of the consent of the parties to submit to ICSID arbitration. LG&E is not in compliance with the time limit established in the Bilateral Treaty. The arbitral jurisdiction established in the Bilateral Treaty is exceptional, and strict respect for this time limit is the *quid pro quo* of a dispute settlement mechanism that does not require investors to exhaust domestic remedies.\n\n(i) The danger of the claims asserted by LG&E is that they might lead not only to an increase in the number of proceedings on the same facts and rights (those of the Licensees), but also to a multiplication of remedies and awards.\n\n45.\n\nIn their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimants allege that they have demonstrated that their claims, under the Bilateral Treaty, cannot be separated into two different disputes. Likewise, they contend to have shown that the temporal requirements for resorting to ICSID arbitration under the Bilateral Treaty, in relation to the additional request, have been met. They also state that Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the Arbitration Rules require that claims should arise directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute and not simply that one should depend on the other.\n\n**III. CONSIDERATIONS ON THE OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nAs agreed by the parties, the objections of the Respondent to the jurisdiction of the Centre or, for other reasons, the competence of the Tribunal, are to be decided as a preliminary question (Article 41 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 41 of the Arbitration Rules). Whilst the parties have advanced many arguments, including those pertaining to the merits, the Tribunal will consider hereafter only those that are relevant to its decision regarding the objections of Respondent to admissibility and jurisdiction.\n\n47.\n\nThis being the case, the Tribunal must, for the sole purposes of determining its competence under the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Treaty, examine the following criteria:\n\n(a) That the dispute is between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State and that the Claimants have the standing *{jus standi)* to act in the present proceedings.\n\n(b) That the dispute is a legal dispute arising directly from an investment.\n\n(c) That the parties have expressed their consent in writing to submit to arbitration and, specifically, to ICSID arbitration.\n\n(d) That the other requirements under the Convention and the Bilateral Treaty for submission to arbitration have been met.\n\n**A.** ***Jus standi***\n-----------------------\n\n48.\n\nIn determining *jus standi,* consideration is to be given to the scope *ratione personae* of the ICSID Convention, which, as its name indicates, involves the presence of a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. There is no doubt about the status of the Argentine Republic. The question arises, however, with the Claimants. They are companies with United States nationality that have made investments in Argentina through local (Argentine) companies, and whose participation in this process has been questioned by the Respondent, because the Argentine companies were directly responsible for operating the activity covered by the license agreements.\n\n49.\n\nPursuant to Article 25 (2)(b) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\" \u2018National of another Contracting State\u2019 means:... (b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\"\n\n50.\n\nIn the present case there is no need of determining what type of control the parent company exercises. Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention refers to \"foreign control\" in the context of who may qualify as an investor with a right to ICSID arbitration (it includes local companies in the host State subject to foreign control). A companion provision can be found in Article VII(8) of the Bilateral Treaty (without the express requirement of control). The present case, however, is concerned with shares held by the Claimants in local companies which the Claimants allege to have been affected by breaches of the Respondent of its obligations under the Bilateral Treaty. Those shares are the investment within the meaning of Article I(1)(a)(ii) of the Bilateral Treaty. The Respondent has not disputed that those shares are \"owned or controlled directly or indirectly\" by the Claimants. In that connection, it is irrelevant whether the shares are majority or minority shares.\n\n51.\n\nIt is also to be noted that the arbitral tribunal in the *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic* case stated that the Convention does not really make control a central tenet of ICSID jurisdiction, but only as an alternative for very specific purposes (\u00a7 58).1\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Jurisdiction, July 17, 2003.\n\n52.\n\nOn the other hand, the reliance by the Respondent on the *Barcelona Traction* case2 is misplaced. Whatever may be the merits of that case, it concerned diplomatic protection by a State to its nationals whilst the present case involves the contemporary concept of direct access to dispute settlement by an investor in investor-State arbitration.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light & Power Co. Ltd. (Belgium v. Spain),* Judgment of February 5, 1970, ICJ Reports 1970, 3.\n\n53.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the license was granted to Argentine companies and not to the Claimants, and therefore the latter alleged that they were shareholders in the Licensees. This argument appears to be incorrect since Article I(1)(a)(ii) of the Bilateral Treaty provides:\n\n\" \u2018investment\u2019 means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes without limitation:.... (ii) a company or *shares of stock* or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof.\" (emphasis added)3.\n\nIn this sense, see the Arbitral Tribunal in *Azurix Corp. v. Argentina* (ICSID Case ARB/01/12), Decision on Jurisdiction of December 8, 2003, para. 73.\n\n54.\n\nArticle VII(8) of the Bilateral Treaty, invoked by the Respondent, is not applicable to this case. It refers to the situation in which a company, legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulation of a State Party, is deemed to be \"an investment of nationals or companies of the other [State] Party\" and, as such, it may resort to international arbitration and \"shall be treated as a national or company of such other [State] Party in accordance with Article 25 (2) (b) of the ICSID Convention.\" Rather, Article VII(8) reinforces the Tribunal\u2019s analysis in the sense that it refers to \"a national or company\" without setting any limit, such as \"foreign control\" as mentioned by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n55.\n\nWith respect to Argentine domestic law, the situation is similar to that established by Article I(1)(a)(ii) of the Bilateral Treaty. Article 2(1) of Act 21,382, adopted through Decree No. 1853/1993 (B.O. 08/09/1993) on the regulation of foreign investment, defines such investment as \"any contribution of capital belonging to foreign investors, applied to economic activities carried out in the country;\" it also includes \"the acquisition of shares of capital in an existing local company by foreign investors.\" In turn, a foreign investor means \"any natural or juridical person domiciled outside the national territory who owns an investment in foreign capital....\"\n\n56.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to Article X of the Bilateral Treaty. That Article does not appear to be relevant either. It merely provides that the Bilateral Treaty shall not derogate from laws and regulations, etc., \"that entitle investments or associated activities to treatment more favorable than that accorded by this Treaty in like situations.\" That is a right addressed to the investor and not the host State.\n\n57.\n\nAs regards the position of the Licensees, on December 17, 1992, National Executive Decree No. 1189/92 ordered the constitution of the Licensees (i.e., Distribuidora de Gas del Centro, Distribuidora de Gas Cuyana and Gas Natural Ban) which were empowered to receive foreign investments for their operations, in order to implement the privatization process. This power is shown in Resolution No. 874/92, which, pursuant to Decree No. 1189/92 of July 10, 1992, ordered the opening of public international bidding for the privatization of the companies referred to therein, including the Licensees. Thus, the investment received by the latter included, among others, capital from LG&E Energy Corp., through LG&E Capital Corp., of which it owns 100%, and LG&E International Corp., wholly owned by LG&E Capital Corp., according to the unrebutted expert report by Bradford Rives, First Vice-President of Finances and Controller of LG&E Energy Corp., dated March 31, 2003.\n\n58.\n\nThis affirmation also supports the inapplicability of the Basic Rules of the License (Dec. 2255/92 of December 2, 1992, published on December 7, 1992, and annexed to the License Decrees issued by the National Executive of the Argentine Republic: Nos. 2453/92, of December 16, 1992; 2454/92 of December 18, 1992; 2460/92 of December 21, 1992 (all published on December 22, 1992). It applies especially in relation to Rule 16(2), according to which:\n\n\"[t]he Licensee agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the administrative courts of the city of Buenos Aires with regard to all the effects derived from this License and concerning the relation with the Licensor. In those disputes involving other parties that are related to the License, the federal courts shall have jurisdiction.\"\n\n59.\n\nConsidering that these rules are intended to regulate the license, the purpose of which, in accordance with Rule 2(1), \"is to grant to the Licensee the authorization to exploit the licensed service,\" they cannot be considered binding on foreign investors, for whom legal protection is provided by the special rules on the subject, as recognized by the Respondent in Decree 669/00, issued by the National Executive on July 17, 2000, which although of a later date than that on which the licenses were granted, is sufficient evidence of the Argentine Republic\u2019s attitude towards treaty law, in recognizing the special application of bilateral treaties on encouragement and protection of investments to gas privatization.\n\n60.\n\nThe proper distinction between a national company having the license and the investors is reaffirmed in the decision on jurisdiction cited above in the *CMS Gas Transmission Company* case, according to which:\n\n\"Because, as noted above, the rights of the Claimant can be asserted independently from the rights of TGN and those relating to the License, and because the Claimant has a separate cause of action under the Treaty in connection with the protected investment, the Tribunal concludes that the present dispute arises directly from the investment made and that therefore there is no bar to the exercise of jurisdiction on this count\" (\u00a7 68).\n\n61.\n\nThis principle was also accepted in the *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. & Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux v. Argentine Republic,*4 especially in relation to Article 16(4) of the concession contract between Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija and the province of Tucum\u00e1n. In this decision, which is apposite to the present case, it is stated that the provision: \"does not divest this Tribunal of jurisdiction to hear this case because that provision did not and could not constitute a waiver by CGE of its rights under Article 8 of the BIT to file the pending claims against the Argentine Republic.\" As formulated, \"these claims against the Argentine Republic are not subject to the jurisdiction of the contentious administrative tribunals of Tucum\u00e1n, if only because, *ex hypothesi,* those claims are not based on the Concession Contract but allege a cause of action under the BIT\" (\u00a7 53). That decision was affirmed in the *CMS Gas Transmission Company* case, as follows: \"[T]he clauses in the License or its Terms referring certain kinds of disputes to the local courts of the Republic of Argentina are not a bar to the assertion of jurisdiction by an ICSID tribunal under the Treaty, as the functions of these various instruments are different\" (\u00a7 76).\n\n***Compania de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. & Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux v. Argentine Republic*** (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Award of the Tribunal, November 21, 2000.\n\n62.\n\nSimilarly, in the case of *Lanco International Inc. v. Argentine Republic,5* it is affirmed that in the case where an investor is also party to a concession contract or license agreement with the host State, this situation does not affect the jurisdiction arising from the provisions of the BIT, since it provides a direct right of action to shareholders (\u00a715).\n\n***Lanco International Inc. v. Argentine Republic*** (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6), Preliminary Decision of the Tribunal, December 8, 1998, in ***International Legal Materials,*** vol. 40, 2001, p. 457.\n\n63.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Tribunal must reject Respondent\u2019s submissions with respect to the question of *jus standi* and conclude that, for the purposes of the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Treaty, the Claimants should be considered foreign investors, even though they did not directly operate the investment in the Argentine Republic but acted through companies constituted for that purpose in its territory.\n\n**B. Investment dispute**\n-------------------------\n\n64.\n\nWithin the framework of ICSID jurisdiction, it is necessary to determine how the term \"dispute\" is to be understood in the proper context. This term is defined in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention as being any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State. This provision again stresses the foreign status of the natural or juridical person making the investment, an aspect which is even more important in the present case. It should be recalled that even though the obligations stipulated in the license agreements are fulfilled by an Argentine company, the investment is effectively made by a group of United States companies, a fact which qualifies this investment as being foreign.\n\n65.\n\nArticle VII of the Bilateral Treaty, for its part, lists the criteria for defining an \"investment dispute.\" The most relevant of these is found in subparagraph (c), according to which: \"an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to... an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\"\n\n66.\n\nRespondent repeatedly emphasizes that Claimants\u2019 claims are to be equated to claims under the license agreement and that the bringing of such claims is impermissible in the present case. However, it appears that Claimants\u2019 claims are based on alleged breaches of the Bilateral Treaty with respect to their investment. Consequently, the present case constitutes an investment dispute within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Treaty.\n\n67.\n\nFinally, Respondent\u2019s argument that the disputes submitted by the Claimants concern general measures taken by the Argentine Government, the Tribunal shares the analysis and conclusion of the Arbitral Tribunal in *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic:6*\n\n\"On the basis of the above considerations the Tribunal concludes on this point that it does not have jurisdiction over measures of general economic policy adopted by the Republic of Argentina and cannot pass judgment on whether they are right or wrong. The Tribunal also concludes, however, that it has jurisdiction to examine whether specific measures affecting the Claimant\u2019s investment or measures of general economic policy having a direct bearing on such investment have been adopted in violation of legally binding commitments made to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts.\"(\u00a7 33)\n\n***CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic*** (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Jurisdiction, July 17, 2003.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal also concludes in the present case that the fact that the Claimants have demonstrated *prima facie* that they have been adversely affected by measures adopted by the Respondent is sufficient for the Tribunal to consider that the dispute, as far as this matter is concerned, is admissible and that it has jurisdiction to examine it on the merits.\n\n**C. Consent to submit to ICSID arbitration**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nFor the attribution of jurisdiction to the Centre, Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention requires, in addition to the necessary participation of a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State and the existence of a dispute arising directly out of an investment, the written consent of the parties to submit to the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n70.\n\nIt is necessary, then, to determine whether both parties have expressed their consent to submit to the Centre, since consent of the parties is \"the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre. Consent to jurisdiction must be in writing and once given cannot be withdrawn unilaterally.\"7\n\nReport of the Executive Directors of ICSID, Doc. ICSID/2, para. 31.\n\n71.\n\nIn relation to the expression of consent by the Contracting States, it is necessary to consider, first, the affirmation in the preamble to the ICSID Convention \"that no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\"\n\n72.\n\nThe Bilateral Treaty contains a multiple clause under which resort can be made to ICSID arbitration or to the Additional Facility of ICSID; to an ad hoc arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties (Article VII(3)).\n\n73.\n\nThe system for establishing consent is clearly set forth in the Bilateral Treaty. The investor, on his part, has to make a choice under the multiple clause by giving consent in writing, subject to a number of conditions (Article VII(3)). The host State, on its part, has already given its consent. In that respect Article VII(4) provides: \"Each Party [i.e., the Argentine Republic and the United States of America] hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3.\" The mutuality of consent is completed by the provision: \"Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for: (a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for the purposes of Chapter II [i.e., Articles 25-27] of the ICSID Convention...\" (Article VII(4) *in fine).* Thus, in accordance with Article 25(1) *in fine,* \"When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\" This system is, for example, confirmed by the Arbitral Tribunal in the *Azurix v. Argentina* case.8\n\n***Azurix*** v. ***Argentina*** (ICSID Case ARB/01/12), Decision on Jurisdiction of December 8, 2003, para. 73., para. 42\n\n74.\n\nIt may be added that the multiple clause has been interpreted on other occasions by ICSID tribunals. One of these is the decision in the *Lanco* case, in which it is stated:\n\n\"the Argentina-US Treaty establishes the possibility of the investor choosing between the local courts (recourse to the courts which in any event are available to natural and legal persons by virtue of the basic principle of the right to effective judicial protection) and other means of dispute settlement, such as arbitration, which requires the previous agreement of the parties. In addition, the Argentina-US Treaty, once certain requirements are met, allows the investor to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration. The Argentina-US Treaty therefore gives the investor the power to choose among several methods of dispute settlement: consequently, once the investor has expressed its consent in choosing ICSID arbitration, the only means of dispute settlement available is ICSID arbitration\" (\u00a731).\n\n75.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants chose to submit their investment disputes to ICSID and are therefore not restricted by the fact that the Licensees have resorted to local tribunals.\n\n76.\n\nSince the investor has the power to choose one of the four forums established in Article VII(3) of the Bilateral Treaty, it is noteworthy in this case that Claimants did not submit the dispute to the Argentine courts or to any other dispute settlement mechanism mentioned in Article VII(2) or (3). Thus, no question regarding the \"fork in the road\" provision arises in the present case.\n\n77.\n\nIt is also important to consider the possibility of exhausting Argentine local remedies as a prerequisite for resorting to ICSID. Thus, Article 26 of the ICSID Convention provides that: \"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention.\" Interpreting this rule, and in application of the multiple clause of the Argentina-United States Bilateral Treaty, the Tribunal held in the *Lanco* case:\n\n\"Article 26 is merely a standard for interpretation, a presumption that arbitration is the exclusive remedy, but that the parties may require exhaustion of domestic remedies. The stipulation to the contrary, if any, would merely eliminate the presumption as to the exclusivity of ICSID arbitration, giving rise to the existence of another forum in which to settle the dispute. This would result in a concurrence of jurisdictions, which would have to be resolved in light of the provision in the second sentence of Article 26. Thus, the second sentence is precisely the waiver, by the Contracting State party, of the prior exhaustion requirement, a requirement that the State may reserve to itself, through such second sentence, which operates as a rule of judicial abstention, such that the local courts to which the State submits a dispute with an investor who is a foreign national should refer the Parties to ICSID arbitration.\" (\u00a7 38).\n\n78.\n\nAs the Tribunal in the *Lanco* case indicated, this criterion was also used in the *MINE v. Republic of Guinea* case9*and Mobil Oil Corporation et al. v. New Zealand.10*\n\n*MINE* v. *Republic of Guinea* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4)\n\n*Mobil Oil Corporation et al.* v. Aew *Zealand* (ICSID Case No. ARB/87/2).\n\n**D. Other requirements**\n-------------------------\n\n79.\n\nAccording to the pleas submitted by the Respondent, no negotiations took place between LG&E and the Argentine Republic with regard to the additional request of the Claimants.\n\n80.\n\nSince more than six months elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose (i.e., 24 January 2002 for the so-called \"Additional Dispute\"), there is no bar to initiating the arbitral proceeding.\n\n81.\n\nThe acts of the Respondent complained of by the Claimants in the \"Additional Request\" are sequential to those alleged by the Claimants in their original Request. Already for that reason and for reasons of efficiency, they need not be addressed in a separate proceeding. Moreover, the Respondent had not shown any prejudice in having the disputes adjudicated in one single set of proceedings. It is also in compliance with Article 46 of the ICSID Convention, according to which:\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"\n\n82.\n\nFurther, it is irrelevant that the Licensees may be in a process of negotiation with the Respondent. They do so from their own (corporate) perspective. If and to the extent that such negotiations have an effect on Claimants' investment, such an effect may form part of the Tribunal's consideration of the merits of the case. This may also apply to the outcome of cases brought by other investors in the Licensees under the Bilateral Treaty against the Respondent.\n\n83.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal need not consider the parties\u2019 other contentions, including those regarding Article 11(1) of the Bilateral Treaty (the most favored nation clause).\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n84.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) holds that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal;\n\n(b) dismisses all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to the admissibility of the dispute and all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal;\n\n(c) ORDERS by virtue of Rule 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules the continuation of the procedure pursuant Section 15.2 of the Minutes of the First Session;\n\n(d) reserves all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and of the parties for subsequent determination."}, {"Title": "Decision on Liability", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2006-10-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Liability\n---------------------\n\n**I. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nClaimants, LG&E Energy Corp, and LG&E Capital Corp, are corporations created and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, in the United States of America, with domestic and foreign operations.1 LG&E International Inc. is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America. Claimants hereinafter will be referred to collectively as \"LG&E\" or \"Claimants.\"\n\nUntil 1 December 2005, Claimants were LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. However, on 26 January 2006, Claimants informed the Tribunal that the name of two of the companies had been modified: LG&E Energy Corp, is now E.ON.US LLC and LG&E Capital Corp, is now E.ON.US. Capital Corp. LG&E International Inc. kept its name. Upon request by the Tribunal, LG&E submitted documents that, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, only prove the change of name but not its effects. Respondent remained silent on this issue.\n\n2.\n\nLG&E has a shareholding interest in three local, gas distributing companies in Argentina created and existing under the laws of Argentina by commandment of the Argentine Government: Distribuidora de Gas del Centro (\"Centro\"), Distribuidora de Gas Cuyana S.A. (\"Cuyana\") and Gas Natural BAN S.A. (\"GasBan\"), hereinafter collectively referred to as \"the licensees\". LG&E owns a controlling equity interest in Centro and minority equity interests in GasBan and Cuyana.\n\n3.\n\nRespondent is the Argentine Republic, which along with the United States of America, is a party to the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"ICSID Convention\" or \"Convention\"), ratified by the Argentine Republic in 1994 and by the United States of America in 1966. The Bilateral Investment Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments was signed on 14 November 1991 (\"BIT\", \"the Bilateral Treaty\" or the \"Treaty\") (and entered into force on 20 October 1994).\n\n**II. THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------\n\n4.\n\nOn 31 January 2002 the Centre\u2019s Secretary-General registered Claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention. In accordance with Rule 7 of the Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"the Institution Rules\"), the Secretary-General gave notice to the parties of the registration of Claimants\u2019 Request and invited them to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n5.\n\nForthwith, the parties agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal should be formed by three arbitrators, one appointed by the Claimants, another by the Argentine Republic and the third one, called to preside over the Tribunal, would be appointed by the Centre\u2019s Secretary-General in accordance with the method agreed upon by the parties.\n\n6.\n\nOn 20 June 2002, the Claimants appointed Professor Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of the Netherlands, as an arbitrator for this case. Said appointment was ratified by the Claimants by letters to the Centre dated 15 and 28 August 2002. The Argentine Republic, by letter dated 26 August 2002, appointed Judge Francisco Rezek, a Brazilian citizen, as an arbitrator. On 7 November 2002, the Centre\u2019s Secretary-General, with the parties\u2019 agreement, appointed Dr. Tatiana B. de Maekelt, a citizen of Venezuela, as the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s President.\n\n7.\n\nOn 13 November 2002, the ICSID\u2019s Secretariat, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), notified the parties that all the arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was deemed to be constituted and the proceeding deemed to begun as from that date. On this same day, in accordance with Rule 25 of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, the parties were informed that Dr. Claudia Frutos-Peterson would act as the Tribunal\u2019s Secretary.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 28 December 2001, ICSID received from LG&E a request for arbitration dated 21 December 2001 against the Argentine Republic.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter dated 24 January 2002 the Claimants filed with ICSID a supplement to their request for arbitration. Claimants asserted that Respondent had committed further violations of the BIT as a result of the enactment by the Government of the Public Emergency and Currency Exchange Law (\"Emergency Law\"), which allegedly adversely affected Claimants\u2019 investment in Argentina.\n\n10.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 13, the Tribunal held its first session with the parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. on 19 December 2002. The parties agreed to set the following schedule for the written proceedure: Claimants were to file a Memorial on 31 March 2003. Upon receipt of Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Respondent could choose to file an answer within either 60 or 90 days. In its answer, Respondent was entitled to file exceptions on jurisdiction, and to the extent it deemed necessary, could respond to Claimants\u2019 arguments on the merits. In the event that the Respondent filed a Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Claimants were to file their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction within 30 days from their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, followed by Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction within 20 days following receipt of Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, and Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction to be filed 20 days from receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction.\n\n11.\n\nWith respect to oral procedure, it was also agreed during the first session to set the following schedule based on the written submissions. In the event that Respondent filed its answer within 60 days and if the Tribunal decided so, there was to be a hearing on jurisdiction between 22 and 23 September 2003. In the event that Respondent filed its answer within 90 days, the hearing on jurisdiction, if the Tribunal were in agreement, was to be held on 20 and 21 October 2003. The hearing on the merits was scheduled for 8 through 12 March 2004.\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants filed their Memorial on 31 March 2003.\n\n13.\n\nSubsequently, under covenant, the parties decided to amend the schedule of proceedings concerning the objections to jurisdiction. Respondent and Claimants informed the ICSID Secretariat of this amendment on 1 and 2 July 2003, respectively. Under the new schedule, Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction was to be filed on 21 July 2003; Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, on 29 August 2003; Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, on 22 September 2003, and Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, on 13 October 2003. It was also agreed that the hearing on jurisdiction was to be held on 20 and 21 October 2003, but subsequently, the Tribunal, in joint agreement with the parties, decided that the hearing on jurisdiction should be held between 20 and 21 November 2003, at The Hague, Netherlands.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with the terms set, on 21 July 2003, Respondent formally filed objections to ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction. In its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Respondent presented the grounds upon which it based said objections and attached documents in support of its arguments. On 29 August 2003, Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction. On 22 September 2003, the Argentine Republic filed its Reply on Jurisdiction, and on 14 October 2003, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n15.\n\nOn 30 October 2003, Respondent filed a motion to suspend the proceedings and requested, as an alternative measure, a stay of the hearing on jurisdiction. On 31 October 2003, the President of the Tribunal asked Claimants to submit their comments on said motion by 3 November 2003. On 3 November 2003, the Claimants filed an objection to the stay motion. On 5 November 2003, the members of the Arbitral Tribunal deliberated on the Argentine Republic\u2019s motion and denied Respondent\u2019s motions to suspend these proceedings and stay the hearing on jurisdiction scheduled for 20 and 21 November 2003.\n\n16.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction was held on the date set, at the seat of the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, the Netherlands. Messrs. Eugene D. Gulland and Oscar M. Garibaldi of the law firm of Covington & Burling from Washington, D.C. acted as counsel for the Claimants. Also present at the hearing were Ms. Dorothy O\u2019Brien, Deputy General Counsel for LG&E Energy Corp, and Mr. S. Bradford Rives, Chief Financial Officer of LG&E Energy Corp.\n\n17.\n\nMessrs. Carlos Ignacio Su\u00e1rez Anzorena and Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9s, on behalf of Dr. Horacio Daniel Rosatti, the then-Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, atended the hearing on behalf of the Respondent.\n\n18.\n\nDuring the hearing, the parties presented their arguments on the jurisdictional issues. The Tribunal posed questions to the parties in accordance with Rule 32(3) of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n19.\n\nOn 30 April 2004, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, holding that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. In so holding, the Tribunal considered the following criteria:\n\na. That the dispute should be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State and that Claimants should have *jus standi* to act in these proceedings;\n\nb. That the issue should be a dispute of a legal nature arising directly from an investment;\n\nc. That the parties should have given their consent, in writing, to submit to arbitration and, specifically to the ICSID arbitration; and\n\nd. That all the other requirements of both the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Treaty should be met in order to submit a dispute to arbitration.\n\n20.\n\nWith respect to criteria (a), regarding *jus standi,* the Tribunal was of the opinion that, for purposes of the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Treaty, Claimants should be considered foreign investors, even though they did not directly operate the investment in the Argentine Republic, but acted through companies constituted for that purpose in its territory (Decision on Jurisdiction, 63).\n\n21.\n\nWith respect to criteria (b), which requires that the issues before the Tribunal be a dispute of a legal nature arising directly from an investment, the Tribunal concluded that, at the jurisdictional phase, it was to be presumed that Claimants\u2019 claims were based on alleged breaches of the Bilateral Treaty affecting Claimants\u2019 investments within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Treaty (Decision on Jurisdiction, 66).\n\n22.\n\nWith respect to criteria (c), requiring the consent of the parties to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration, the Tribunal was of the opinion that the Argentine Republic\u2019s consent was given through Article VII(4) of the Bilateral Treaty. In turn, when Claimants resorted to ICSID, they decided to submit their investment disputes to the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction. It is noteworthy, in this case, that Claimants did not submit the dispute to the Argentine courts or to any other dispute settlement mechanism mentioned in Article VII of the Bilateral Treaty. For this reason, no question regarding the \"fork in the road\" provision arises in the present case (Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b669 *et. seqj.*\n\n23.\n\nFinally, with respect to criteria (d), concerning verification of the other requirements of the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Treaty, the Tribunal concluded that the claims are not time barred, and that the claims asserted in the additional request filed by Claimants are sufficiently sequential to the originally stated claims as to permit their review by this Tribunal for the sake of efficiency. The fact that the license holders may have begun negotiations with Respondent is outside this arbitral proceeding, inasmuch as the license holders, which are different legal entities, are pursuing that process from their own (corporate) perspective. Thus, in view of the fact that more than six months elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, i.e. 24 January 2002, there is no bar in initiating the arbitral proceedings (Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b680 *et. seq).*\n\n24.\n\nBased on these considerations, the Tribunal:\n\na. Held that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal;\n\nb. Dismissed all of the Respondent\u2019s objections as to the admissibility of the dispute and all of the Respondent\u2019s objections to the jurisdiction of ICSID and the competence of this Tribunal;\n\nc. Ordered, pursuant to Rule 41(4) of the Arbitration Rules, the continuation of the proceeding;\n\nd. Reserved all questions concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the parties for future determination.\n\n25.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1 dated 4 May 2004, Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits on 18 June 2004, seeking dismissal of LG&E\u2019s claims. On 6 August 2004, Claimants filed their Reply.\n\n26.\n\nRespondent filed its Rejoinder on the merits on 27 September 2004, in which it asked the Tribunal, among other legal and factual arguments, to exclude Claimants\u2019 witness, Mr. Patricio Perkins, from the hearing on the merits on grounds of an alleged conflict of interest. Claimants objected to Respondent\u2019s motion to exclude the witness on 1 November 2004.\n\n27.\n\nBy means of Procedural Order No. 3, dated 23 November 2004, the Arbitral Tribunal decided (i) to admit the witness depositions offered by Respondent; (ii) to grant Claimants the opportunity to offer additional evidence regarding the witness depositions produced by Respondent in its Rejoinder, at the latest on 20 December 2004 and to cross-examine said witnesses during the hearing on the merits; (iii) to admit the testimony of Mr. Patricio Perkins, subject to cross-examination by Respondent.\n\n28.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Orders Nos. 4 and 5, dated 13 and 18 January 2005, respectively, the hearing on the merits was held between 23 and 29 January 2005, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C.

The parties filed their observations with the Tribunal on that date.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n33.\n\nBefore considering the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal deems it necessary to set forth the facts that it considered relevant for its decision.\n\n**A. Late 1980s and 1990s**\n---------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe present claims are to be viewed against the historic background and especially the economic upheaval in Argentina and the Government\u2019s reaction to the several economic crises suffered by the country in the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\n35.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Argentina underwent an economic crisis characterized by deep recession and hyperinflation. As part of its economic recovery plan, the Government began an ambitious privatization program with the enactment of the State Reform Law in August 1989. Within this framework, large Government-owned businesses and entities were privatized or granted on concession (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6121).\n\n36.\n\nOne March 27, 1991, Argentina enacted Law No. 23,928, referred to as the *Convertibility Law,* which ordered the implementation of a fixed exchange rate, pegging the *austral* (the then-Argentine currency) to the United States dollar.2 The Convertibility Law also banned price or value indexation.\n\nThe *austral* later was replaced by the **peso** at the rate of 1,000 *australs* to 1 **peso**\n\n37.\n\nOne of the primary goals of the Government\u2019s plan was the privatization of *Gas del Estado S.E.,* the national natural-gas transport and distribution monopoly. Pursuant to the Government\u2019s privatization plan, investors could purchase shares in newly-formed, licensed private corporations that would offer gas transport and distribution services. Such shares were available to domestic and foreign investors.\n\n38.\n\nTo implement its plan, the Government enacted in June 1992, the *Ley del Gas* (\"Gas Law\"), which established a comprehensive regulatory structure for the provision of natural-gas transport and distribution services, and created a public agency, called *Ente Nacional Regulador del Gas* (ENARGAS) to oversee the industry.\n\n39.\n\nThe Gas Law adopted a tariff structure under which ENARGAS would collect tariffs on the price of gas paid by consumers. Under the provisions of the Gas Law, ENARGAS was required to set the transport and distribution tariffs at fair and reasonable levels that would allow licensed utility providers to recoup a \"reasonable rate of return,\" after accounting for costs, defined as a rate similar to that applied to activities of similar risk and adequately related to the level of efficiency and satisfactory performance of the transport or distribution service. Profitability was to be measured against other activities of comparable risk.\n\n40.\n\nENARGAS was to set maximum tariffs for a period of five years. At the end of the five-year period, the tariffs were to be reviewed and adjusted based on international market indicators that reflected changes in the value of the goods and services representative of the activities of service providers.\n\n41.\n\nThe Gas Law was implemented by regulations adopted on 28 September 1992 by Decree No. 1738/92. Pursuant to these regulations, transport and distribution tariffs were to be calculated in U.S. dollars and then expressed in Argentine pesos, and the Government could not rescind or modify the licenses without the consent of the licensees.\n\n42.\n\nOn 7 December 1992, the Government adopted Decree No. 2255/92, called *Reglas B\u00e1sicas de la Licencia* (Basic Rules of the License), which supplemented the Gas Law and the above-mentioned regulation and approved prototype licenses for natural-gas transport and distribution. The prototype licenses included a schedule of the maximum tariffs for the first five-year period (1993-1997) of service. The Basic Rules of the License obligated the Government to compensate the licensees fully for any losses resulting from changes to the guaranteed tariff system. The Basic Rules of the License also implemented the semi-annual tariff review based on the U.S. Producer Price Index (\"PPI\"), to be conducted in January and June of each year (\"PPI adjustment\").\n\n43.\n\nUnder this framework comprised of the Gas Law, its regulations and Basic Rules of the License, the five-year review was to be a comprehensive review of the method used to calculate tariffs.\n\n44.\n\nBy Decree No. 1189/92, published on 17 July 1992, Argentina approved the procedure for the privatization of *Gas del Estado S.E.* It was restructured into two distinct transport business units and eight separate distribution business units, each responsible for a geographic region of the country. Each of the ten business units were transferred to the newly-created companies, which were to operate with a license under the legal framework in force.\n\n45.\n\nAn international bidding process was set in place by Resolution No. 874/92 issued by the Ministry of Public Works and Services and conducted pursuant to the *Pliego de Bases y Condiciones para la Licitaci\u00f3n* (\"Bidding Rules\"). Under these Bidding Rules, both foreign and domestic investors were free to bid on the shares. The purpose of the Bidding Process was the purchase and sale of the majority interest in each of the licensed companies created by Decree No. 1189/92. Three of those majority interests were sold during that bidding process: 60% of Cuyana\u2019s shares, 70% of GasBan\u2019s shares, and 90% of Centro\u2019s shares.\n\n46.\n\nIn December 1992, the Argentine Government awarded the contracts for the purchase of the majority of shares in the ten newly-formed licensees into which *Gas del Estado S.E.* had been restructured. The licenses relevant to this dispute were approved by Decrees Nos. 2454/92 for Centro, 2460/92 for GasBan and 2453/92 for Cuyana, and became effective on 22 December 1992.\n\n47.\n\nThe blocks of shares of Centro, GasBan and Cuyana that were subject to privatization were awarded to private investors: 90% of the shares of Centro were awarded to a consortium formed by *Societ\u00e0 Italiana Per II Gas S.p.A.* (\"Italgas\"), an Italian company, and *Sideco Americana S.A.,* an Argentine company (\"Sideco\"); 70% of the shares of GasBan were awarded to a consortium formed by *Gas Natural SdG S.A.,* a Spanish company, *Compania General de Combustibles S.A.* and *Manra S.A.,* both Argentine companies; and 60% of the shares of Cuyana were awarded to a consortium formed by Italgas and Sideco.\n\n48.\n\nThree Argentine investment companies were created as vehicles for the acquisitions: (i) *Inversora de Gas del Centro S.A.* to acquire the privatized shares of Centro; (ii) *Invergas S.A.* to acquire the privatized shares of GasBan; and (iii) *Inversora de Gas Cuyana S.A.* to acquire the privatized shares of Cuyana. The successful bidders or their affiliates became shareholders of the respective investment companies, which then entered into Transfer Agreements with the Respondent concerning the shares subject to this arbitration.\n\n49.\n\nThe privatization scheme created by Respondent targeted foreign investors because foreign capital was deemed essential for the successful operation of the Government\u2019s economic recovery plan. Foreign investors were encouraged to purchase shares with guarantees, such as tariffs calculated in U.S. dollars, automatic and periodic adjustments to the tariffs based on the PPI, a clear legal framework that could not be unilaterally modified, and the granting of \"licenses\" instead of \"concessions\" with a view to offering the highest degree of protection to prospective investors.\n\n50.\n\nAs part of its marketing efforts, Argentina distributed an Information Memorandum in foreign markets, including the United States and Europe. The Information Memorandum summarized the legal framework governing the privatization, the terms and conditions for the bidding, the bidding process and the legal and the regulatory framework that would apply to the new industry after privatization. The information in the memorandum concerning the privatization, prepared and distributed by investment banks, contained descriptive information and included disclaimers to discourage investors from relying solely on the information therein.\n\n51.\n\nDuring this period, Argentina undertook to provide enhanced legal protection to investors so as to attract foreign investment in support of its privatization scheme. The Respondent ratified several treaties relating to international investment obligations, such as the ICSID Convention and a great number of bilateral investment treaties, including the Argentina-U.S. Bilateral Investment Treaty at issue in this dispute. As mentioned above, the Convertibility Law, which pegged the peso to the U.S. dollar, was also enacted at this time.\n\n52.\n\nIn reliance on the legal guarantees offered by the Argentine Government for the privatized energy industry, and based on its positive prior experience investing in the privatized Argentine gas market in 1992, Claimants chose to purchase shares of three licensed companies in the gas-distribution market. In February 1997, LG&E purchased a 45.9% interest in Centro and a 14.4% interest in Cuyana. In March 1999, LG&E purchased a 19.6% interest in GasBan.\n\n53.\n\nFrom 1993 until the end of 1999, Claimants agree that the gas-distribution licensees and Respondent abided by their respective obligations under the licenses and law governing the privatization scheme. According to Claimants, the licensees invested heavily in Argentina\u2019s natural-gas-distribution infrastructure. GasBan invested about US$372 million in a new plant and equipment, even though originally required to invest US$90.9 million; Centro invested US$92 million, although originally required to invest US$10 million; and Cuyana invested more than US$120 million, although originally required to invest US$10 million. In return, Argentina honored the provisions of the licenses and other legal obligations, including the semi-annual tariff adjustment under the PPI indicator, and calculation of the tariffs in U.S. dollars.\n\n**B. Economic Crisis and the Emergence of the Dispute -1999-2001**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nA new economic crisis developed in Argentina in the late 1990s. In the third quarter of 1998, the Argentine economy plunged into a period of recession that was to last four years and triggered, in Respondent\u2019s opinion, the worst economic crisis since Argentina\u2019s inception in 1810 (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 782).\n\n55.\n\nIn 1999, Argentina\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (\"GDP\") decreased causing a dramatic fall in domestic prices. Private consumption and investments began falling in August 1998 and Argentina entered a deflationary period. The period was marked by widespread decline in the value of assets located in Argentina. By the end of the 1990s, many economists considered the peso as overvalued, and predicted that the currency board would have to be abandoned, which would inevitably devalue the peso. Argentina\u2019s country risk premium increased, gradually excluding the country from the international credit market. These economic indicators were accompanied by social problems -unemployment, poverty and indigence levels began to increase. On 10 December 1999, Mr. Fernando de la R\u00faa took office as the President of Argentina. His administration tried to maintain the peg of the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar as mandated by the Convertibility Law.\n\n56.\n\nAgainst this background, public services rates, as specified in the contracts, were due to be adjusted in January 2000 based on the PPI. At the time, the United States was experiencing a high inflationary period, while Argentina was experiencing a significant deflationary period. As established in the Gas Law, the tariffs were to be adjusted to reflect changes in the cost structure of utility providers (Gas Law, Article 41). Argentina considered that the pending tariff adjustments based on the U.S. rate were unreasonable because they would result in a significant increase in utility rates within a recessionary and deflationary context.\n\n57.\n\nArgentina met with the gas-distribution licensees to discuss a temporary suspension of the semi-annual tariff adjustments. Two agreements that the Government and the licensees entered in 2000 formed part of Claimaints\u2019 original claim submitted to this arbitration.\n\n58.\n\nOn 6 January 2000, the Government and the licensees entered an agreement *(Acta Acuerdo)* whereby the licensees agreed to a one-time, six-month postponement of the tariff adjustment due in January 2000. Pursuant to the agreement, the tariffs would be recovered with interest from 1 July 2000 to 30 April 2001. Therefore, through resolutions published on 10 January 2000, ENARGAS approved the tariff effective as from 1 January 2000 without the PPI adjustment. The ENARGAS resolutions provided that the legal regime governing the tariffs would remain intact.\n\n59.\n\nDuring the first six months of 2000, the situation in the Argentine economy continued to deteriorate. The semi-annual PPI adjustment would have forced a second tariff increase in a continued deflationary period. Although the licensees had agreed to only one-time tariff adjustment postponement, the Government urged the gas-distribution licensees to accept a second postponement of the tariff adjustments; including the previously postponed adjustments that were scheduled to be recovered beginning on 1 July 2000 in accordance with the *Acta Acuerdo* of 6 January 2000.\n\n60.\n\nOn 17 July 2000, by Decree No. 669/00, effective 4 August 2000, the licensees and the Government agreed to a second postponement of the tariff adjustments until 30 June 2002. Pursuant to the agreement, a stabilization fund would be created to recover the postponed amounts, subject to certain ceilings and floors, with interest. As with the previous agreement, this agreement reaffirmed the Government\u2019s commitments and guarantees provided to the licensees and their investors under the legal structure created for the privatization of the gas industry, specifically recognizing the enforcement of Argentina\u2019s bilateral investment treaties and the semi-annual PPI adjustments as an integral component of the tariff system.\n\n61.\n\nOn 3 August 2000, the Argentine National Ombudsman filed a lawsuit in an Argentine Federal Court, seeking an injunction against the operation of Decree No. 669/00. On 18 August 2000, the Court issued an order provisionally enjoining the application of Decree No. 669/00 and of the agreement of 17 July 2000. On 5 October 2001, the Court of Appeal ratified the order and the case is presently pending before the Supreme Court (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 255).\n\n62.\n\nENARGAS declared in November 2001 that no further adjustments to the tariffs would be approved until final judgment in the lawsuit. No further adjustments to the tariffs have occurred to date.\n\n**C. The Emergency Law - 6 January 2002**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nArgentina\u2019s crisis deepened at the end of 2001. The Government experienced increased difficulties in repaying its foreign debt. As poverty and unemployment soared, Argentines feared that the Government would default on its debt and immobilize bank deposits. Therefore, savings were massively withdrawn from the banks. In response, the Government issued Decree No. 1570/01, known as *\"Corralito,\"* on 1 December 2001, restricting bank withdrawals and prohibiting any transfer of currency abroad. Amid widespread discontent and public demonstrations, including violence that claimed tens of lives, President De la Rua and his Cabinet resigned on 20 December 2001. A succession of presidents took office and quickly resigned.\n\n64.\n\nFinally, President Eduardo Duhalde took office and implemented a new economic plan, which contained measures that form the additional claim submitted by Claimants. On 6 January 2002, Congress enacted Law No. 25,561, the Public Emergency and Foreign Exchange System Reform Law (known as \"the Emergency Law\"). The Emergency Law abrogated the Convertibility Law so that the one-to-one peg of the Argentine peso to the United States dollar no longer existed. The Emergency Law provided for the switch into Argentine pesos of debts owed to the banking system, debts arising from management contracts governed by public law, and debts under private agreements. The law further provided for the renegotiation of private and public agreements to adapt them to the new exchange system.\n\n65.\n\nThe Emergency Law adopted measures modifying public-service contracts, such as establishing that tariffs and prices for public services were to be calculated in pesos, instead of U.S. dollars; abolishing all clauses calling for tariff adjustments in U.S. dollars or other foreign currencies; eliminating all indexing mechanisms; and directing the Executive Branch to renegotiate all public-service contracts.\n\n66.\n\nBy Presidential Decree No. 214 of 3 February 2002, the Government adopted a currency conversion scheme under which all obligations payable in dollars existing on the date of enactment of the Emergency Law would be converted into pesos at the fixed one-to-one exchange rate.\n\n67.\n\nThe switch into Argentine pesos, also called \"pesification,\" which affected the entire Argentine economy, was characterized by Respondent as a necessary process to return the country to the path of economic stability.\n\n**D. Renegotiation of the Public Service Contracts**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nOn 12 February 2002, Argentina announced the renegotiation of all public service contracts. By Decree No. 293/02, licenses for transport and distribution of natural gas were subject to mandatory renegotiation by a Renegotiation Committee within the Ministry of Economy. Under the Decree, the Government could either sign a renegotiated agreement or rescind the contract. By Resolution No. 38/02, issued on 9 March 2002, ENARGAS was ordered to discontinue all tariff reviews and to refrain from adjusting tariffs or prices in any way.\n\n69.\n\nAfter enactment of the Emergency Law, the licensees and the Argentine Executive launched three initiatives to implement an emergency increase in the natural gas and electricity tariffs. Each of these initiatives was successfully challenged by consumer organizations and ombudspersons in the Argentine judiciary and consequently did not become effective. The Argentine Government attempted twice more in 2003 to obtain tariff increases through Presidential Decrees but both these efforts were also quashed by the judiciary.\n\n70.\n\nOn 25 May 2003, a new Argentine President, Dr. N\u00e9stor Kirchner, took office after a popular election was held on 26 April 2003, replacing the transition authorities that had been appointed by the Argentine Congress. Respondent states that with the new administration, a period of institutional stabilization at the federal level began (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, 317).\n\n71.\n\nBy Presidential Decree No. 311/03, published on 4 July 2003, and Law No. 25,790, passed on 22 October 2003, the Argentine Government extended the renegotiation process. Centro, Cuyana and GasBan have been involved in the renegotiation process under threat of rescission of contract. During the renegotiation process, the Government has not offered to restore the legal guarantees that were eliminated by the Emergency Law, or compensate Claimants for any losses incurred.\n\n**E. Request for Relief**\n-------------------------\n\n72.\n\nBearing in mind the background already described, Claimants request the following relief (Request for Arbitration, 111 as revised in Claimants\u2019 Memorial at 208):\n\n(i) Declaring that the Respondent has breached its obligations under Article II(2)(c) of the Bilateral Treaty by failing to observe obligations that it entered into with regard to the Claimants\u2019 investment;\n\n(ii) Declaring that the Respondent has breached its obligations under Article II(2)(a) of the Bilateral Treaty by failing to accord to the Claimants\u2019 investment fair and equitable treatment and by according treatment less than that required by international law;\n\n(iii) Declaring that the Respondent has breached its obligations under Article II(2)(b) of the Bilateral Treaty by taking arbitrary and discriminatory measures that impair the use and enjoyment of the Claimants\u2019 investment;\n\n(iv) Declaring that the Respondent has breached Article IV(1) of the Bilateral Treaty by indirectly expropriating the Claimants\u2019 investment without complying with the requirements of the Bilateral Treaty, including observance of due process of law and payment of prompt, adequate, and effective compensation;\n\n(v) Ordering the Respondent to pay the Claimants full compensation in the amounts set forth in the Memorial, plus pre- and post-award compound interest;\n\n(vi) Ordering the Respondent to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the cost of the Claimants\u2019 legal representation, plus interest thereon in accordance with the Bilateral Treaty; and\n\n(vii) Such other or additional relief as may be appropriate under the Bilateral Treaty or may otherwise be just and proper.\n\n73.\n\nAccording to Claimants\u2019 Reply fl| 287), the relief they seek is stated as follows:\n\n1. Finding the Argentine Republic to be in breach of its obligations under the Treaty;\n\n2. Ordering the Argentine Republic to pay LG&E: (i) compensation in the amounts specified in Part VI of [the] Reply; (ii) all costs and fees of the arbitration, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees; and (iii) compound interest on the monetary award from the date of the award until the date of actual payment; and\n\n3. Ordering such additional relief as may be appropriate under the applicable law or otherwise just and proper.\n\n74.\n\nThe monetary relief sought by Claimants is US$ 248 million or, if the Tribunal concludes that there was expropriation, US$ 268 million, plus compound pre-award and post-award interest and costs.\n\n75.\n\nRespondent denies that it has violated the Treaty and seeks an order from this Tribunal dismissing LG&E\u2019s claims and holding LG&E liable for costs. In asserting its defense, Respondent contends in the alternative that the circumstances warrant application of the state of necessity defense, thus exempting it from liability for any Treaty violations.\n\n**V. PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n76.\n\nIn the analysis below, the Tribunal has not only considered the positions of the parties as summarized in the various sections above, but also their numerous detailed arguments in support of those positions as well as the arguments made at the hearing. To the extent that these arguments are not referred to expressly, they must be deemed to be subsumed in the analysis below.\n\n**A. Jus Standi**\n-----------------\n\n77.\n\nWith respect to *jus standi,* the Tribunal re-affirms its conclusions adopted in the Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 30 April 2004. As determined in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Centre has jurisdiction over LG&E\u2019s claims and this Tribunal is competent to decide on Claimants\u2019 claims.\n\n78.\n\nArgentina continues to argue that this Tribunal shall only have jurisdiction if Argentina\u2019s non-compliance with an international obligation is verified (Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, 521(a)). Pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction issued on 30 April, 2004, the Tribunal deems that all the obligations in discussion are international because they relate to the Treaty. Thus, LG&E\u2019s minority-shareholder status has no bearing on its standing to bring these claims or on the Tribunal\u2019s competence to rule upon them.\n\n79.\n\nIt should be pointed out that, as this Tribunal stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the subject matter of this arbitration focuses on the investments made by LG&E in the Argentine licensees. Accordingly, the Tribunal has insisted on the independent treatment of LG&E regarding the licensees, both from the point of view of the legal personality of each entity and from the actions of each. This does not mean, however, that certain actions of the licensees, by the fact that they are the investment\u2019s beneficiaries, may have, in some cases, effects on the investment itself. For such reasons, on occasion, the Tribunal shall be bound to refer to the licensees and their actions without implying a reference to LG&E. One should bear in mind that the recognition of the independence among these entities was the basis on which the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal were supported.\n\n**B. Law Applicable**\n---------------------\n\n**1. Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants argue that their claims asserted arise under the Treaty. The law that applies to the dispute is therefore the Treaty and general international law. Claimants contend that this approach comports with the first part of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. In Claimants\u2019 view, Argentine law merely establishes a factual predicate for the claims under the Treaty and general international law (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6155-56).\n\n81.\n\nRespondent does not deny the application of the Bilateral Treaty to this dispute, but argues that in the absence of an agreement on the applicable law, the relationship between LG&E and the Argentine Government should be subject to the second part of Article 42(1) of the ICSD Convention, which establishes the precedence of sources of law; therefore, the Argentine law should be applied first. Respondent asserts that \"where an investor makes an investment in a State it is subject -as are local investors- to the laws of the country where the investment is made\" (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b625). Argentina stresses the insufficiency of the Treaty to govern the dispute at issue, particularly in light of the substantive framework regarding the foreign investment\u2019s treatment under Argentine law.\n\n**2. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n82.\n\nIn accordance with Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\n\"(1) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of International Law as may be applicable.\"\n\n83.\n\nThis rule grants the parties\u2019 autonomy in choosing the law applicable to the substance of the dispute in an arbitration administered by ICSID. If no applicable law is chosen, the Tribunal must resort to the second sentence of Article 42(1).\n\n84.\n\nIt is evident that the parties hereto had not agreed on the applicable law in this dispute. This is usually found in the investment agreement, though this does not hold in this case. Nor is there any express reference to the applicable law in other documents related to the investment by LG&E, a fact that would result in the application of the second part of Article 42(1).\n\n85.\n\nIt is to be noted that the Argentine Republic is a signatory party to the Bilateral Investment Treaty, which may be regarded as a tacit submission to its provisions in the event of a dispute related to foreign investments. In turn, LG&E grounds its claim on the provisions of the Treaty, thus presumably choosing the Treaty and the general international law as the applicable law for this dispute. Nevertheless, these elements do not suffice to say that there is an implicit agreement by the Parties as to the applicable law, a decision requiring more decisive actions. Consequently, the dispute shall be settled in accordance with the second part of Article 42(1).3\n\nSchreuer, Christoph, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 573.\n\n86.\n\nIn addition to the indication of the applicable law, there are two other concepts embedded in the second part of Article 42(1) which deserve comment \u2014the references to private international law and to the rules of international law \"as may be applicable\".\n\n87.\n\nAs to the reference to the private international law, the Tribunal has not found in the ICSID records any case in which the Arbitral Tribunal has resorted to the rules of conflict of law of the State party to the dispute. It has been so observed in the *Amco v. Indonesia* case, in which the Arbitral Tribunal, presided by Berthold Goldman, affirmed that it did not deem it necessary to enter into a discussion on the rules of conflict, inasmuch as the parties make constant references to the law of the State party in the dispute and, moreover in \"the dispute before the Tribunal relating to an investment in Indonesia, there is no doubt that the substantive municipal rules of law to be applied by the Tribunal are to drawn from Indonesian Law.\"4 The Tribunal in this case shares the same criterion.\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia,* Award of 20 November 1984, 1 ICSID Rep. 413 (1993).\n\n88.\n\nWith reference to the rules of international law and, particularly, to the language \"as may be applicable,\" found in Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal holds the view that it should not be understood as if it were in some way conditioning application of international law. Rather, it should be understood as making reference, within international law, to the competent rules to govern the dispute at issue.5 This interpretation could find support in the ICSID Convention\u2019s French version that refers to the rules of international law \"en *la mati\u00e8re\"6*\n\n*\"It simply means that the relevant rules of international law are to be applied. \"* Schreuer, Cristoph, *The ICSID Convention... op.cit.,* p. 622.\n\n*Convention CIRDI, Art. 42: \"(1) (1) Le Tribunal statue sur le diff\u00e9rend conform\u00e9ment aux r\u00e8gles de droit adopt\u00e9es par les parties. Faute d\u2019accord entre les parties, le Tribunal applique le droit de l\u2019Etat contractant partie au diff\u00e9rend\u2014y compris les r\u00e8gles relatives aux conflits de lois\u2014ainsi que les principes de droit international*  ***en la mati\u00e8re*** (emphasis added). In: *http://www.worldbank.Org/icsid/basicdoc-fra/partA-chap04.htm#s03.*\n\n89.\n\nLikewise, applying the rules of international law is to be understood as comprising the general international law, including customary international law, to be used as an instrument for the interpretation of the Treaty. For example, where a term is ambiguous, or where further interpretation of a Treaty provision is required, the Tribunal will turn to its obligations under Articles 3 land 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, signed in 1969.\n\n90.\n\nHaving made this part clear, the Tribunal proceeds to analyze the extension of the remission to the domestic law contained in the second part of Article 42(1), whereby the Tribunal shall apply \"the law of the Contracting State Party to the dispute...\" The Argentine doctrine contributes to gaining insight into the remission\u2019s scope: \"the situation is much clearer by virtue of the incorporation of the international law to the Argentine law and the hierarchical relation conferred by the 1994 constitutional reform to international treaties in Article 75, paragraph 22,7 of the National Constitution.\"8\n\n\"... the treaties and concordats are hierarchically superior than laws...\"\n\nTawil, Guido Santiago, *Los conflictos en materia de inversi\u00f3n, la jurisdicci\u00f3n del CIADI y el Derecho aplicable: a prop\u00f3sito de las recientes decisiones en los casos \"Vivendi\", \"Wena\"* y *\"Maffezini\".* in *RAP,* October 2002 Year XXV, N\u00b0 239, pp. 241 *etseq.,* especially pp. 256-257.\n\n91.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that as part of the Argentine legal system, the Bilateral Treaty prevails over domestic law, \"especially, inasmuch as in most of the Bilateral Treaty\u2019s assumptions there is an express mention of international law, be it when referring to the treatment to be given to investments, or to the compensation in the event of expropriation or any other like measure, etc.\"9\n\n*Idem,* p. 256. The author bases liis opinion on the *Vivendi* case.\n\n92.\n\nThis interpretation has been accepted in Argentina \"as long as the litigation is linked to the violation of the BIT [bilateral investment treaty] and of international law and not to the mere pretensions of infringement of a local contract and as the parties should have not provided expressly the law applicable to the first of said disputes, the decision shall be governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and applicable international law. Thus, the BIT becomes the *lex specialis* regarding disputes appearing in matters of investment between the foreign investor and the Host State.\"10\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n93.\n\nIt is this Tribunal\u2019s opinion that obviating application of international law, specifically of the ICSID Convention and the Bilateral Treaty, would entail ignoring the fact that \"international treaties move away from the principle according to which foreign investment is subject to the law and jurisdiction of the host state and seek international solution of conflicts.\"11 This thesis, held by part of the Argentine doctrine, indicates that when submitting the settlement of a dispute to an Arbitral Tribunal acting within the framework of an international agreement, like ICSID, the dispute falls under public international law; thus its rules are to be applied.12 However, the problem is more complex as has been admitted by several scholars, who are of the opinion that it is necessary to \"balance the weight that domestic law and international law should have upon the settlement of the dispute\"13, this is, to establish an order of precedence of the sources.\n\n*See Investment for foreigners in Argentina:* www. *enplenitud. com/*\n\nGrigera Na\u00f3n, Horacio, *Choice of Law Problems in International Commercial Arbitration,* J.C.B. Mo In- (Paul Siebeck) T\u00fcbingen, Germany, 1992, p. 115.\n\nVives Chillida, Julio, *El Centro Internacional de Arreglos de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones* *(CIADI),* Madrid, McGraw Hill, 1998, p. 195.\n\n94.\n\nInternational law overrides domestic law when there is a contradiction since a State cannot justify non-compliance of its international obligations by asserting the provisions of its domestic law.\n\n95.\n\nIf this contradiction does not exist, it is not an easy task to establish the relationship between international law and domestic law. In the original draft of the ICSID Convention, the conjunction \"and\" was not present in the rule, but rather the conjunction \"or\" was in its place, so that it read, \"The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide the dispute submitted to it in accordance with such rules of law, whether national or international as it shall determine to be applicable.\"14 The intention in the language of the original draft was not to establish an order of preference, but rather to establish the possibility of alternatives. Initially, scholarly authorities and some ICSID Tribunals admitted that the conjunction \"and\" meant that \"and in case of lacunae, or should the law of the Contracting State be inconsistent with international law.\"15 However, any limitation to the role of international law under these terms would imply accepting that international law may be subordinate to domestic law and would obviate the fact that there are a growing number of arbitrations initiated on the basis of bilateral or multilateral investment treaties.\n\nSchreuer, Christoph, *The ICSID Convention... op. cit.,* p. 623\n\nGaillard, Emmanuel and Banifatemi, Yas, *The Meaning of \"and\" in Article 42(1), second sentence, of the Washington Convention: The Role of International Law in the ICSID choice of the law process,* ICSID Review, Foreign Investment Law Journal, 2003, Vol. 12, No. 2, pp. 375 et seq., especially pp. 381-382. See also: Schreuer, Christoph, *op. cit,* p. 263.\n\n96.\n\nIt is this Tribunal\u2019s opinion that \"and\" means \"and,\" so that the rules of international law, especially those included in the ICSID Convention and in the Bilateral Treaty as well as those of domestic law are to be applied. In the *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* case, the Tribunal affirmed that \"and means and\", but accepted the supremacy of international law.16\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case N\u00b0 ARB/98/4, Decision on Application for Annulment, Feb. 5, 2002, 41 ILM 933 (2002).\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, as the tribunal concluded in the *Asian Agricultural Products,* Ltd, *(AAPL) v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,* Award of June 27, 1990, that the Treaty \"is not a self-contained closed legal system limited to provide for substantive material rules of direct applicability, but it has to be envisaged within a wider juridical context in which rules from other sources are integrated through implied incorporation methods, or by direct reference to certain supplementary rules, whether of international law character or of domestic law nature.\"17\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. (AAPL) v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3, Final Award, June 27, 1990, 6 ICSID Review 533 (1991).\n\n98.\n\nIn short, one must also recall that between Argentina and LG&E there is no binding contractual agreement. The existence of such relationship would have allowed the parties to agree on stabilization clauses in the event of changes in certain circumstances. But, in the absence of such agreement, one is bound to resort to a legal system regulating those events. The fact that there is no contract between the Argentine Republic and LG&E favors in the first place, the application of international law, inasmuch as we are dealing with a genuine dispute in matters of investment which is especially subject to the provisions of the Bilateral Treaty complemented by the domestic law.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion**\n----------------------------\n\n99.\n\nIn order to settle this controversy, the present Tribunal shall apply first the Bilateral Treaty; second and in the absence of explicit provisions therein, general international law, and, third, the Argentine domestic law, particularly the Gas Law that governs the natural gas sector. The latter is applicable in view of its relevance for determining the Argentine Republic\u2019s liability and the defenses to which it may resort vis-\u00e0-vis the allegations made by Claimants.\n\n**VI. LIABILITY**\n-----------------\n\n**A. Article II(2)(a): Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n100.\n\nBased on the circumstances of this case as described in Section IV above, LG&E claims that the Argentine Republic breached Article II(2)(a) of the Bilateral Treaty, which guarantees that LG&E\u2019s investment in Argentina will at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment.\n\n101.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, by committing itself to the Treaty, Argentina made promises to the United States as to how it would treat the investments of U.S. nationals in Argentina. In Article II, Argentina agreed to maintain an investment environment that is even-handed towards all investors, foreign and domestic alike, free of arbitrary and discriminatory laws and regulations, and ultimately fair and equitable, offering full protection and security to the investments of U.S. nationals.\n\n102.\n\nClaimants explain that fair and equitable treatment in the context of this Treaty, requires a stable and predictable legal framework for the investment. Claimants support their interpretation of the standard on the basis of the Preamble of the Treaty, which sets forth the object and purpose of the Treaty and specifically the provision on fair and equitable treatment, as well as three recent opinions of arbitral tribunals considering the question in a similar context.18 Claimants contend that, under this standard, a State cannot grant treatment that affects the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. Considering that the Treaty\u2019s objective was to promote foreign investment, Claimants argue that the stability and predictability of the legal framework that laid the foundations for their investment and granted protection to its value are particularly important.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/00/02 Award \u00b6 154 (29 May 2003)\n\n; *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7 Award \u00b6 113 (25 May 2004); *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case No. UN 3467 Final Award (1 July 2004).\n\n103.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2019s reliance on the *Genin* case, Claimants argue that as the *Genin19* case is merely a standard for evaluating the fairness and equity of State procedures, such a standard should be evaluated in light of more recent cases.\n\n*Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. The Republic of Estonia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2 Award, \u00b6 367 (25 June 2001).\n\n104.\n\nClaimants also contend that the extent to which the fair and equitable standard relates to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law makes no difference in this case because that standard has evolved since the *Mondev20* case to include the reasonable expectations of the investor.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)99/2, Award, \u00b6116 (October 11, 2002).\n\n105.\n\nUnder this articulation of the standard, Claimants state that Argentina treated LG&E\u2019s investment in an unfair and inequitable manner. *First,* Argentina repudiated the guarantees that it had offered to the foreign investors at the time it induced them to invest in Argentina. *Second,* Argentina singled out the gas-distribution industry and other public utility industries, for treatment that was less favorable than the treatment granted to all other sectors of the economy. *Third,* Argentina publicized unfounded charges against the foreign investors and coerced the gas-distribution companies to waive their rights under the licenses and renegotiate the licenses. *Fourth,* Argentina held the licensees responsible for strict compliance with the terms of the licenses while the Government froze the gas-distribution tariffs. *Finally,* Claimants allege that Argentina foreclosed the licensees from pursuing judicial or arbitral remedies (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 171).\n\n106.\n\nArgentina had attracted Claimants with the guarantees derived from the Treaty and the legal framework for privatization, under which its laws and regulations guaranteed how Argentina would treat LG&E\u2019s investment. In making their decision to invest in Argentina, Claimants relied on Argentine laws that granted protection against currency fluctuation and inflation, while providing for adjustment of utility rates, thus ensuring reasonable rates of return and that the Argentine Government would not freeze utility rates, but rather maintain a dynamic tariff system, regulated by an expert agency.\n\n107.\n\nClaimants did not expect their investment to be free of risk, or that Article II of the Bilateral Treaty should protect them from all risks associated with their investment. But they insist that the gas regulatory framework that Argentina put in place made their investment free from risk of regulatory alterations or changes in the rules in which they had invested. LG&E understood that it would bear what it calls \"commercial risks,\" such as industry demand, recession and substitution of natural gas by alternative fuels (Hearing on the Merits, Perkins, 24 January, 2005, Spanish Transcript, p. 369; Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, 8).\n\n108.\n\nClaimants allege that, during the economic crisis, Argentina abandoned the guarantees that it made to investors in the gas-distribution sector. In January 2002, the Emergency Law swept away the protection against inflation. Argentina forced licensees to enter into two agreements postponing the PPI adjustments, after which an Argentine court issued an order that ENARGAS interpreted as an injunction against the PPI adjustment. The Emergency Law permanently abolished the PPI adjustment.\n\n109.\n\nThe Emergency Law also abandoned the protection against currency fluctuations. The Gas Law had guaranteed that the tariffs would be calculated in dollars and converted into pesos. In reliance on this protection against any sharp devaluation of the peso, Claimants decided to invest in the licensees.\n\n110.\n\nIn light of these prior measures, Claimants argue that Argentina repudiated its guarantee that generally prohibited the freezing or control of tariffs (Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b615-31).\n\n111.\n\nWhile Claimants acknowledge that the material used by Respondent in order to make the offer was not binding, the laws and promises referenced therein were (Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 9). Claimants add that if establishing the tariffs had been left to the State, investors would have never invested.\n\n112.\n\nRespondent objects to the definition given to fair and equitable treatment. In Respondent\u2019s view, the standard should be defined by impartial and objective rather than personal and arbitrary criteria. They conclude that Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the standard is so vague as to ignore the parties\u2019 obligations and rights (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 603-604).\n\n113.\n\nCiting *Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. The Republic of Estonia21* and *Robert Azinian, Kenning Davitian & Ellen Baca v. The United Mexican Stated22,* Respondent concludes that the fair and equitable treatment principle refers to the international minimum standard of treatment owed to an investor, and as such, constitutes a minimum pattern for substantive justice (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 620). Respondent also contends, citing *S.D. Myers Inc. v. The Government of Canada23* that a violation of the fair and equitable standard \"occurs only when it is shown that an investor has been treated in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective\" (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, 621-622).\n\nSee *Genin,* footnote No. 19 *supra.*\n\n*Robert Azinian and others v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, \u00b6\u00b6 83 and 87, (1 November 1999).\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada,* NAFTA Arbitration under UNCITRAL Rules, Partial Award, \u00b6 263, (13 November 2000).\n\n114.\n\nRegarding the list of guarantees cited by Claimants, Respondent contends that the Gas Law does not provide for what Claimants call \"exchange protection\" (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 74a). Respondent points out that, in fact, when Claimants\u2019 witnesses were examined, they were not able to identify where any such \"protection\" had been established. Respondent also asserts that the tariff calculation in U.S. dollars was linked to the existing fixed rate of exchange between the peso and the U.S. dollar as established by the Convertibility Law. None of Claimants\u2019 witnesses was able to prove the opposite. Respondent adds that maintaining tariffs linked to the U.S. dollar after the convertibility system was abandoned lacks any economic logic. Respondent points out that none of the Government\u2019s guarantees address the abandonment of convertibility.\n\n115.\n\nWith respect to the tariff guarantee, Respondent argues that it is possible that the Argentine authorities had considered guaranteeing the calculation of the tariffs in U.S. dollars regardless of the Convertibility Law, but such plan was rejected due to the fact that the Government concluded that the Convertibility Law provided sufficient protection to the investment (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, 26).\n\n116.\n\nWith respect to the PPI adjustments, Respondent argues that from mid-1998, application of the PPI as the rate adjustment index became unreasonable and failed to fulfill the goal it was conceived for - namely, reflecting the changes in the value of the goods and services involved in the activity of service providers (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 44). Additionally, Respondent states that the measure did not cause loss to the licensees. Citing the opinions of Schwartz and Lapuerta, Respondent contends that suspension of the PPI adjustment would have affected tariffs only by approximately 2% between August 2000 and October 2002 (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, 1146).\n\n117.\n\nRespondent agrees that the tariffs must be fair and sufficient, yet not abusive, something that would occur if the Claimants\u2019 position were sustained (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 74c).\n\n118.\n\nRegarding the claim that the Claimants were \"induced\" to invest in the Argentine Republic, Respondent argues that there is no proof of such inducement (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, 647). Respondent points out that the Claimants rely on non-binding documents, such as reports and minutes without any legal relevance. According to Respondent, these documents were irrelevant to the laws that should have been considered in deciding whether or not to invest in the Argentine gas-distribution market (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 17).\n\n**2. Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion Concerning Argentina\u2019s Guarantees to Investors**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Gas Law and its implementing regulations made four guarantees to investors in the gas transport and distribution centers:\n\n1. Article 41.1 of Decree No. 1738/92,24 and Section 9.2 of the Basic Rules of the License25 mandated that the tariffs would be calculated in U.S. dollars before conversion into pesos.\n\n2. Section 9.4.1.1 of the Basic Rules of the License guaranteed that the tariffs would be subject to semi-annual adjustments according to the PPI.26\n\n3. Article 38 of Law No. 24,076 provided that tariffs were to provide an income sufficient to cover all costs and a reasonable rate of return.27\n\n4. Section 9.8 of the Basic Rules of the License guaranteed that the tariff system would not be subject to freezing or price controls without compensation.28\n\nArticle 41.1 provides: \"Transportation and Distribution rates shall be calculated in United States dollars. The resulting Rate Schedule shall be stated in Argentine pesos and shall be convertible as stated in Law No. 23,928, using for the retranslation into Argentine pesos the parity set forth in Article 3 of Argentine Presidential Decree No. 2,128/91.\"\n\nSection 9.2 provides: \"The tariff has been calculated in U.S. dollars. The adjustments referred to in point 9.3 will be calculated in U.S. dollars.\"\n\nSection 9.4.1.1 provides: \"Distribution tariffs will be adjusted semiannually according to the variation operated in the PPI.\"\n\nArticle 38 provides: \"The services rendered by distributors will be offered at tariffs in line with the following principles:  \n a)To provide distributors who operate economically and prudently the opportunity to obtain sufficient income to meet all reasonable operating costs applicable to the service, taxes, amortization, and a reasonable rate of return, as determined in the following article.\"\n\nSection 9.8 provides: \"Licensee\u2019s tariff system will not be subject to freezing, administration and/or price control. If, in spite of this stipulation, Licensee is forced to adapt to a price control system establishing a lower level than that arising from the Tariff, Licensee will have the right to be compensated by the Government in an equivalent amount.\"\n\n120.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that as a matter of fact, the Emergency Law, passed on 6 January 2002, declared that the tariffs would no longer be calculated in U.S. dollars but directly in pesos (Article 8), and that there would be no further semi-annual tariff adjustments according to the PPI (Article 8). The Tribunal notes that since July 1999, there have not been any PPI adjustments in the tariffs relating to the licensees and the five-year review due in 2002 was not conducted - both affecting the level of the tariffs in the gas-distribution sector and, as a consequence, Claimants\u2019 rate of return on their investment. Argentina took these steps without compensating Claimants and forcing Claimants to renegotiate (a process in which an Argentine official recommended that investors waive their claims against the Government relating to the licenses) or face rescission of the licenses. (Decree No. 293/02, Article 2 and Claimants\u2019 Memorial \u00b6\u00b6120 *et seq).*\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe question before the Tribunal is whether the measures implemented by Argentina violated Argentina\u2019s obligation under Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty to give fair and equitable treatment to LG&E\u2019s investment.\n\n122.\n\nThe Treaty does not define what is meant by fair and equitable treatment. In these circumstances, the Tribunal must interpret this provision in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms in their context, and in light of its object and purpose, as required by Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n123.\n\nThe Treaty, following the general trend with investment treaties, provides for treatment applicable to investors in the host State through the establishment of a series of internationally recognized standards.29 Due to the fact that such international standards have a generic nature and that their interpretation varies with the course of time and with the circumstances of each case, it becomes difficult to establish an unequivocal and static concept of these notions.\n\nThe notion of a standard appeared for the first time in a 1948 treaty, the Havana Charter for an International Trade Organization, and it was considered a protection against state actions violating internationally-accepted rules. In the 1960s it was related to the protection given to foreign properties. In international case law, the standard existed pursuant to the interpretation provided in the 1920s in the emblematic *Neer* case, which required that State conduct be deemed outrageous, wrongful, open injustice, an atrocity, bad faith or voluntary negligence of duty for a violation to be found. That interpretation is not the same that is given today. What was considered an \"atrocity\" in 1926 might not be so today, and what may be considered \"violent\" now, may not have been at that time. See *\"Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law\",* OECD, Working Paper on International Investment, November 2003/4.\n\n124.\n\nIn considering the context within which Argentina and the United States included the fair and equitable treatment standard, and its object and purpose, the Tribunal observes in the Preamble of the Treaty that the two countries agreed that \"fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective use of economic resources.\" In entering the Bilateral Treaty as a whole, the parties desired to \"promote greater economic cooperation\" and \"stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic development of the parties\". In light of these stated objectives, this Tribunal must conclude that stability of the legal and business framework is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment in this case, provided that they do not pose any danger for the existence of the host State itself.\n\n125.\n\nSeveral tribunals in recent years have interpreted the fair and equitable treatment standard in various investment treaties in light of the same or similar language as the Preamble of the Argentina - U.S. BIT.30 These tribunals have repeatedly concluded based on the specific language concerning fair and equitable treatment, and in the context of the stated objectives of the various treaties, that the stability of the legal and business framework in the State party is an essential element in the standard of what is fair and equitable treatment.31 As such, the Tribunal considers this interpretation to be an emerging standard of fair and equitable treatment in international law.\n\nSee, e.g., *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8 Award (12 May 2005) (Argentina-U.S. BIT); *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case No. UN 3467 Final Award (1 July 2004) (U.S.-Ecuador BIT - almost identical language); *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile SA. v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7 Award \u00b6 113 (25 May 2004) (Malaysia-Chile BIT); *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l Award \u00b6 75 (30 August 2000). (An underlying objective of Article 102(1) of NAFTA is \"to promote and increase cross-border investment opportunities and ensure the successful implementation of investment initiatives\").\n\n*CMS,* \u00b6 274; *Occidental,* \u00b6183. See also *Metalclad,* 99 (\"Mexico failed to ensure a transparent and predictable framework for Metalclad\u2019s business planning and investment\").\n\n126.\n\nAlthough the Chile - Malaysia BIT does not include express reference in its Preamble with respect to fair and equitable treatment, the tribunal in *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* referred to the objectives of the Treaty set forth in the Preamble, and concluded that in light of these objectives, fair and equitable treatment meant treatment in an \"even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment.\"32\n\n*MTD,* \u00b6113.\n\n127.\n\nIn addition to the State\u2019s obligation to provide a stable legal and business environment, the fair and equitable treatment analysis involves consideration of the investor\u2019s expectations when making its investment in reliance on the protections to be granted by the host State. Indeed, this view is reflected in the *Tecmed* decision, that has been adopted by a succession of tribunals:\n\n\"The Arbitral Tribunal considers that this provision of the [BIT], in light of the good faith principle established by international law, requires the Contracting Parties to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations.33\"\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/02, Award \u00b6 154 (29 May 2003); *cited in e.g.,* *MTD,* \u00b6 114; *Occidental,* \u00b6 185; *CMS,* \u00b6279.\n\n128.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Waste Management, Inc. v. The United Mexican States,* interpreting the fair and equitable treatment standard under NAFTA Article 1105(1) concluded that in applying the fair and equitable treatment standard, \"it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"34 This means that violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard may arise from a State\u2019s failure to act with transparency -that is, all relevant legal requirements for the purpose of initiating, completing and successfully operating investments made, or intended to be made under an investment treaty should be capable of being readily known to all affected investors.35\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. The United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award \u00b6 98 (30 April 2004).\n\nSee e.g., *Tecmed,* \u00b6 154; *CMS,* 278-79 and *Occidental,* \u00b6 185 (citing the *Tecmed* and *Metalclad* passages referring to transparency).\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that bad faith or something comparable would ever be necessary to find a violation of fair and equitable treatment. The tribunal in *Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. The Republic of Estonia,36* did not reach this conclusion either. The tribunal merely stated: \"Acts that would violate this minimum standard *would* *include* acts showing a willful neglect of duty... or even subjective bad faith\" (emphasis added).37 The tribunal concluded that bad faith was not a requirement for a finding of a violation of fair and equitable treatment.38\n\n*Genin,* \u00b6 367.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\nSee, e.g., *Mondev,* \u00b6 116 October 11, 2002 (\"To the modem eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith.\"); *see also Occidental,* 63 (\"this is an objective requirement that does not depend on whether the Respondent has proceeded in good faith or not.\"); *see also* *Tecmed,* \u00b6 153 (relying *on Mondev)', Waste Management,* \u00b6 93 (rejecting the standard set forth in the *Neer* case involving willful neglect of duty and bad faith).\n\n130.\n\nIt can be said that the investor\u2019s fair expectations have the following characteristics: they are based on the conditions offered by the host State at the time of the investment; they may not be established unilaterally by one of the parties; they must exist and be enforceable by law; in the event of infringement by the host State, a duty to compensate the investor for damages arises except for those caused in the event of state of necessity; however, the investor\u2019s fair expectations cannot fail to consider parameters such as business risk or industry\u2019s regular patterns.\n\n131.\n\nThus, this Tribunal, having considered, as previously stated, the sources of international law, understands that the fair and equitable standard consists of the host State\u2019s consistent and transparent behavior, free of ambiguity that involves the obligation to grant and maintain a stable and predictable legal framework necessary to fulfill the justified expectations of the foreign investor.\n\n**4. Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion**\n----------------------------\n\n132.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that Argentina violated the fair and equitable treatment provision in the Bilateral Treaty for the following reasons.\n\n133.\n\nEmerging from the economic crisis of the late 1980s, Argentina created an economie recovery plan mainly dependent upon foreign capital. Argentina prepared with the investment banks an attractive framework of laws and regulations that addressed the specific concerns of foreign investors with respect to the country risks involved in Argentina. In light of these risks, Claimants relied upon certain key guarantees in the Gas Law and implementing regulations, such as calculation of the tariffs in U.S. dollars before their conversion into pesos, the semi-annual PPI adjustments, tariffs set to provide sufficient revenues to cover all the costs and a reasonable rate of return, and compensation in the event that the Government altered the tariff scheme. Having created specific expectations among investors, Argentina was bound by its obligations concerning the investment guarantees vis-\u00e0-vis public utility licensees, and in particular, the gas-distribution licensees. The abrogation of these specific guarantees violates the stability and predictability underlying the standard of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n134.\n\nSpecifically, it was unfair and inequitable to pass a law discarding the guarantee in Decree No. 1738/92 that the tariffs would be calculated in U.S. dollars and then converted into pesos. As pointed out by Claimants, this was not merely an economic and monetary policy of the Argentine Government which materialized through the Convertibility Law. Rather, it was a guarantee laid down in the tariff system. This guarantee was very important to investors to protect their investment, which was made in dollars, from a subsequent devaluation of the peso.\n\n135.\n\nArgentina also acted unfairly and inequitably in the manner in which it abrogated the guarantees of the Gas Law and its implementing regulations, adversely affecting the gas-distribution sector but not affecting other sectors of the economy. For example, certain contracts, such as those in the export industry, were excluded from the forced conversion to pesos regulation, or the conversion was performed at a more favorable rate to the individual or company.\n\n136.\n\nArgentina acted unfairly and inequitably when it prematurely abandoned the PPI tariff adjustments and essentially froze tariffs prior to the onset of the public disorder and threats to its essential security in December 2001, and when it refused to resume adjustments when conditions had normalized in April 2003, forcing instead the licensees to renegotiate.39 History has shown that the PPI adjustments that initially were supposed to be postponed have been abandoned completely and are now being \"negotiated\" away.\n\nAs described more fully below, Argentina is excused from liability for the measures taken during the extreme circumstances of December 2001 until April 2003 in order to maintain public order and protect its essential interests. It was fair that during this period of time, Argentina suspended the guarantees of the Gas Law and postponed the PPI tariff adjustments until such time as the Government could manage to resume its obligations.\n\n137.\n\nArgentina also has acted unfairly and inequitably in forcing the licensees to renegotiate public service contracts, and waive the right to pursue claims against the Government, or risk rescission of the contracts. Even though the Gas Law provided for the renegotiation of public service contracts, in practice there was no real renegotiation, but rather the imposition of a process.\n\n138.\n\nLikewise, the Government\u2019s Resolution No. 38/02 issued on 9 March 2002, which ordered ENARGAS to discontinue all tariff reviews and to refrain from adjusting tariffs or prices in any way, also breaches the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal nevertheless recognizes the economic hardships that occurred during this period, and certain political and social realities that at the time may have influenced the Government\u2019s response to the growing economic difficulties. Certainly, LG&E was aware of the risks inherent in investing in a foreign State. But here, the Tribunal is of the opinion that Argentina went too far by completely dismantling the very legal framework constructed to attract investors.\n\n**B. Article II(2)(b): Discriminatory and Arbitrary Treatment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Discriminatory Treatment**\n-------------------------------\n\n**(i) Parties\u2019 Positions**\n--------------------------\n\n140.\n\nClaimants contend that the Argentine Government adopted measures that discriminated against the downstream gas sector (transport and distribution) compared to upstream businesses (production), large industrial customers, and other sectors not dominated by foreign investors, such as alternative energy and the public. In their view, such discrimination violates Article II(2)(b) of the Bilateral Treaty, which provides that \"[n]either Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments.\"\n\n141.\n\nClaimants state that, from the time of the first PPI adjustment until the enactment of the Emergency Law of 6 January 2002, the gas industry received treatment different from that accorded to similarly situated public utilities, including electricity and water distribution companies. These other public utilities continued to enjoy the PPI adjustment until the enactment of the Emergency Law.\n\n142.\n\nClaimants also support their contention by pointing out that, following enactment of the Emergency Law on 6 January 2002, the Government subjected most of the privatized public-utility sector, including the gas-distribution industry, to the least favorable of several regimes devised for the conversion of dollar obligation into pesos. Within the public-utility sector, Claimants also allege that the Government discriminated against the gas-distribution industry by excluding other public-service companies from the conversion of tariffs into pesos. The Government imposed upon the privatized gas-distribution companies what was considered the worst exchange and tariff system during the Argentine crisis.\n\n143.\n\nClaimants stress that if one compares the measures that affected sectors such as gas production, alternative energy sources or even those of the public sector, with those affecting gas transportation or distribution, the Tribunal can only conclude that the Argentine Government discriminated against the gas distribution and transportation sectors. The alleged discrimination is particularly obvious in Claimants\u2019 view by the fact that most of the investors in the gas-distribution sector are foreigners.\n\n144.\n\nRespondent argues that the measures it adopted were not discriminatory because they were general measures without any unreasonable distinction. Respondent questions whether Argentina\u2019s measures can be considered discriminatory, if one acknowledges, as Claimants have, that other industries related to public services were affected by the measures adopted regarding the PPI (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 700).\n\n145.\n\nRespondent explains that each public service is regulated by its own set of tariff rules, and for that reason, the effect may not have been exactly the same for all sectors, including the field of public services. Respondent alleges that \"[i]t is irrational and illegitimate to compare one utility to a different one, subject to different rules, different agreements and different characteristics, and then hold that it is discriminatory to treat differently the different utilities at stake\" (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 703, emphasis omitted).\n\n**(ii) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n146.\n\nIn the context of investment treaties, and the obligation thereunder not to discriminate against foreign investors, a measure is considered discriminatory if the intent of the measure is to discriminate or if the measure has a discriminatory effect.40 As stated in the *ELSI Elettronica* *Siculo. SpA* case *(United States of America v. Italy),* ICJ Report 1989 RLA 56 at 61-62 (20 July 1989), in order to establish when a measure is discriminatory, there must be (i) an intentional treatment (ii) in favor of a national (iii) against a foreign investor, and (iv) that is not taken under similar circumstances against another national.\n\nSee Vandevelde, Kenneth J., *United States Investment Treaties: Policy and Practice,* Kluwer Law and Taxation, 1992, p. 77.\n\n**(iii) Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion**\n-------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nWhile the Tribunal concludes that based on the evidence presented, Respondent treated the gas-distribution companies in a discriminatory manner, imposing stricter measures on the gas-distribution companies than other public-utility sectors, Claimants have however not proven that these measures targeted Claimants\u2019 investments specifically as foreign investments.\n\n148.\n\nCertainly, all the gas-distribution companies were affected by the economic crisis and by the Government\u2019s measures like all other companies within the public-utility sector. However, Argentina suspended PPI adjustments for the gas industry two years before enacting the Emergency Law. It did not take the same action with respect to the public-utility companies such as the electricity and water distribution companies, in which case it continued to adjust their tariffs until enactment of the Emergency Law. Instead, the gas-distribution companies were subjected to unfavorable regimes devised for the conversion of dollar obligations and tariffs into pesos. Even though it was not proved that these measures had been adopted with the purpose of causing Claimants\u2019 foreign investments damage, discrimination against gas distribution companies vis-\u00e0-vis other companies, such as water supply and electricity companies, is evident.\n\n**2. Arbitrary Treatment**\n--------------------------\n\n**(i) Parties\u2019 Positions**\n--------------------------\n\n149.\n\nClaimants characterize Argentine Government\u2019s course of conduct towards the gas-distribution licensees as arbitrary in violation of Article II(2)(b) of the Bilateral Treaty. Claimants articulate the standard for what constitutes an \"arbitrary\" act as \"disregard for the rule of law\" (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 176).\n\n150.\n\nClaimants argue that, in taking measures against the gas-distribution licensees and other public utilities, the Argentine Government acted in disregard for the rule of law. According to Claimants, the Government acted under the trappings of laws, decrees, resolution, regulations and court decisions, but by willfully repudiating the commitments it made to the gas-distribution licensees and their shareholders, the Government followed \"the rule of power, not the rule of law\" (Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 44). In Claimants\u2019 view, the Government\u2019s wholesale repudiation of the tariff system was unnecessary to achieve the stated aims of the PPI suspension or those of the Emergency Law, since the the tariff system was sufficiently flexible to allow Respondent to reduce tariffs unilaterally, for any reason, as long as it paid compensation to the licensees. Instead, the Government chose to dismantle the whole tariff system without granting due compensation (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 176).\n\n151.\n\nClaimants argue that when Respondent\u2019s Bilateral Treaty obligations and the promises made to the foreign investors became politically and economically inconvenient, Respondent ignored its obligations and repudiated the Gas Law\u2019s key provisions. These measures, they assert, not only surprise but also contradict any sense of Respondent\u2019s ownership of its legal obligations, and accordingly they are arbitrary in nature. Claimants refute as without evidence any assertion by Respondent that if the guarantees had not been abolished, tariffs would have tripled or quadrupled in price (Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, 44).\n\n152.\n\nIn its defense, Respondent contends that the measures were not arbitrary; on the contrary, they were reasonable and proportionate to the end pursued. In Argentina\u2019s view, the tariff system was not dismantled. Rather, it was modified by the measures that the Government was forced to put in place during the economic crisis. Respondent suggests that under the circumstances, the deferment of the PPI adjustment in the year 2000 was a reasonable measure. This position, as Respondent views it, is supported by both a decision of a court of first instance and by the Federal Court of Appeal (C\u00e1mara Federal de Apelaciones), which concluded that the adjustment at issue was unreasonable within the recessive economic context endured by the Argentine Republic. The stability that Claimants argue should characterize the legal system does not mean that the system will exist in perpetuity, immutability or immobility. Any requirement of \"freezing the law\" without considering the social and economic circumstances under which the laws were enacted, is transforming the Argentine legal system into a \"frivolous rite\" (Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, 638-639).\n\n153.\n\nRespondent contends that linking the tariff adjustments to the peso (pesificaci\u00f3n) is not arbitrary or discriminatory. Had there been no link to the peso, many customers could not have had access to the gas service, which would have resulted in the collapse of the distribution industries themselves, and tariffs would have been no longer fair but abusive.\n\n154.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, none of the measures adopted by the Argentine Government may be qualified as arbitrary or discriminatory. On the contrary, they were proportionate and reasonable under the circumstances and accordingly, not a violation of Article II(2)(b) of the Bilateral Treaty (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, 112).\n\n**(ii) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n----------------------------\n\n155.\n\nArticle II(2)(b) of the Bilateral Treaty provides that \"[n]either Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments.\"\n\n156.\n\nThe term \"arbitrary\" is left undefined by the Bilateral Treaty. Thus, the Tribunal looks to its plain meaning for international law to determine whether the measures adopted by Argentina could be classified as arbitrary.\n\n157.\n\nAccording to international law, arbitrariness has been described as \"a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.\"41 The tribunal in *Ronald S. Lauder v. The Czech Republic,* referring to the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, defined the term as \"depending on individual discretion; (...) founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact.\"42\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.pA. (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy),* 1989 I.C.J. 15, 76 (Judgment of 20 July).\n\n*Ronald S. Lauder v. The Czech Republic,* Final Award \u00b6221 (3 September 2001) *(citing* Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 100 (7th ed. 1999)).\n\n158.\n\nIt is apparent from the Bilateral Treaty that Argentina and the United States wanted to prohibit themselves from implementing measures that affect the investments of nationals of the other Party without engaging in a rational decision-making process. Such process would include a consideration of the effect of a measure on foreign investments and a balance of the interests of the State with any burden imposed on such investments. Certainly a State that fails to base its actions on reasoned judgment, and uses abusive arguments instead, would not \"stimulate the flow of private capital.\"43\n\nPreamble, Argentina - U.S. BIT (1994).\n\n159.\n\nThe *Genin* case quoted by Respondent provides a good example of a State measure upholding a guarantee similar to the prohibition in the Estonia -U.S. BIT against arbitrary treatment. There, the tribunal concluded that the Bank of Estonia\u2019s annulment of a license occurred in the course of exercising its statutory obligations to regulate the Estonian banking sector, and therefore was not arbitrary.44 In so concluding, the tribunal accepted Estonia\u2019s explanation that the circumstances of political and economic transition prevailing in Estonia at the time justified heightened scrutiny of the banking sector, and that such regulation by a State reflects \"a clear and legitimate public purpose.\"45\n\n*Genin,* \u00b6 370.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n160.\n\nIn contrast, the *Lauder* tribunal determined that the acts of the Czech Republic\u2019s Media Council were arbitrary. Such acts consisted in forcing a private investor in the newly-privatized company that held the state television license to exchange a direct participation in the company for a contractual relationship.46 The tribunal reasoned that the act was motivated by fear of the political implications of having a foreigner influencing Czech television broadcasts47\n\n*Lauder,* \u00b6 222-32.\n\n*Lauder,* \u00b6\u00b6229, 232.\n\n**(iii) Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion**\n-------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThis case lands between the two cases mentioned above, but ultimately the Tribunal concludes that the acts of Argentina were not arbitrary, and therefore did not violate Article II(2)(b) for the following reasons.\n\n162.\n\nWhile Claimants have alleged Argentina\u2019s political motivation to use foreign investors in the public utility sector as an excuse to justify the economic mistakes committed in the country, Argentina has explained that the Government\u2019s motivation was its desire to avoid its full economic collapse. To this end, it entered into agreements with the licensees in 2001, in addition to other actions taken. Bearing in mind the Tribunal\u2019s analysis, characterizing the measures as not arbitrary does not mean that such measures are characterized as fair and equitable or regarded as not having affected the stability of the legal framework under which gas transportation companies in Argentina operated. On the contrary, this means that Argentina faced severe economic and social hardships from 2001 onwards and had to react to the circumstances prevailing at the time. Even though the measures adopted by Argentina may not have been the best, they were not taken lightly, without due consideration. This is particularly reflected in the PPI adjustments which, before deciding on their postponement, Argentina negotiated with the investors. The Tribunal concludes that the charges imposed by Argentina to Claimants\u2019 investment, though unfair and inequitable, were the result of reasoned judgment rather than simple disregard of the rule of law.\n\n163.\n\nLikewise, it was not arbitrary, though unfair and inequitable, not to restore the Gas Law or the other guarantees related to the gas distribution sector and to implement the contract renegotiation policy.\n\n**C. Article II(2)(c): The Umbrella Clause**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n164.\n\nLG&E claims that Argentina violated Article II(2)(c) of the BIT when it assumed certain fundamental obligations with regard to investments in its gas-distribution sector and the foreign investors and then repudiated each of these legal commitments without compensating Claimants for their loss.\n\n165.\n\nAs LG&E explains it, Argentina used foreign capital investment as the cornerstone of its economic recovery plan in the early 1990s. Respondent designed the privatization of *Gas del Estado S.E.* as an international bidding process, in which the conditions for bidding on local enterprises could be met only by a consortium involving foreign investors. Argentina wooed foreign investors with promises of return on investment that would always be reasonable, protections against currency exchange and inflation, adjustment of rates pursuant to international indexes, no unilateral changes and no price controls without indemnification. Argentina bound itself to these promises in the form of legal obligations.\n\n166.\n\nAccording to Claimants, these are the promises that the umbrella clause is meant to address. The Tribunal need not decide that every commitment regarding investments embodied in general legislation or regulations gives rise to obligations that must be observed under that clause. Rather, liability derives from this article of the Treaty when in the particular circumstances of this case, Respondent failed to observe its obligations.\n\n167.\n\nThe problem with LG&E\u2019s claim, according to Respondent, is that it assumes that general legislation relating to the natural gas distribution and transportation industry falls within Article II(2)(c)\u2019s parameter. Respondent suggests that such promises do not qualify as specific representations that make the umbrella clause effective.\n\n168.\n\nRespondent also asserts that LG&E\u2019s claims are nothing more than claims of contractual breaches, which are to be considered under the specific jurisdictional clauses of the contract and not adjudicated in an international forum under application of the umbrella clause.\n\n**2. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n169.\n\nArticle II(2)(c) of the Treaty provides that \"[e]ach party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"\n\n170.\n\nSuch clause, referred to as an \"umbrella clause,\" is a general provision included in a fairly large number of bilateral treaties that creates a requirement for the host State to meet its obligations towards foreign investors, including those that derive from a contract. Hence such obligations receive extra protection by virtue of their consideration under the bilateral treaty.\n\n171.\n\nIn many cases it has been considered that the umbrella clause is activated not by obligations set forth in municipal law, but in contracts between the State and the investor.48 Several of those tribunals have concluded that the breach of a contractual obligation in a contract between the State and the investor gives rise to a claim under the umbrella clause.49\n\n*See e.g.,* *CMS,* \u00b6 300 (citing cases).\n\n*CMS,* \u00b6 303; *SGS v. Republic of the Philippines,* Decision on Jurisdiction, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6 (29 January 2004), \u00b6\u00b6127-28.\n\n172.\n\nThe issue for the Tribunal\u2019s consideration is whether the provisions of the Gas Law and its implementing regulations constitute (i) \"obligations\" (ii) \"with regard to\" LG&E\u2019s capacity as a foreign investor (iii) with respect to its \"investment,\" such that abrogation of the guarantees set forth in the Gas Law and its implementing regulations give rise to a violation of the Treaty.\n\n173.\n\nIn this case, it will be necessary to establish whether LG&E\u2019s claims fall under the umbrella clause\u2019s protection.\n\n174.\n\nIn order to determine the applicability of the umbrella clause, the Tribunal should establish if by virtue of the provisions of the Gas Law and its regulations, the Argentine State has assumed international obligations with respect to LG&E and its investment. To this end, it is necessary to remember that the provisions of the Gas Law and its regulation fixed and regulated the tariff scheme ensuring the value of Claimants\u2019 investment; that the purpose of Claimants\u2019 investment was to increase the value of its shares in the Licensees through a fragile balanced management of profits and costs, represented by the tariffs fixed by Argentina in light of the already mentioned Gas Law and its regulation. In view of the statements above, the Tribunal concludes that these provisions were not legal obligations of a general nature.50 On the contrary, they were very specific in relation to LG&E\u2019s investment in Argentina, so that their abrogation would be a violation of the umbrella clause.\n\n*SGS v. Philippines,* \u00b6 121 (\"For [the umbrella clause] to be applicable, the host State must have assumed a legal obligation, and it must have been assumed vis-\u00e0-vis the specific investment - not as a matter of the application of some legal obligation of a general character.\").\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion**\n----------------------------\n\n175.\n\nAs such, Argentina\u2019s abrogation of the guarantees under the statutory framework - calculation of the tariffs in dollars before conversion to pesos, semi-annual tariff adjustments by the PPI and no price controls without indemnification - violated its obligations to Claimants\u2019 investments. Argentina made these specific obligations to foreign investors, such as LG&E, by enacting the Gas Law and other regulations, and then advertising these guarantees in the Offering Memorandum to induce the entry of foreign capital to fund the privatization program in its public service sector. These laws and regulations became obligations within the meaning of Article II(2)(c), by virtue of targeting foreign investors and applying specifically to their investments, that gave rise to liability under the umbrella clause.\n\n**D. Considerations on Indirect Expropriation**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n176.\n\nLG&E seeks a declaration from this Tribunal that Argentina expropriated LG&E\u2019s investment in the Argentine gas-distribution sector without compensation in violation of Article IV of the Treaty, which provides, in part:\n\n\"1. Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (\"expropriation\") except for a public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article 11(2).\"\n\n177.\n\nLG&E articulates its expropriation claim as one of indirect expropriation. In other words, LG&E argues that the Argentine Government\u2019s treatment of Claimants\u2019 investment in the Licensees constitutes an indirect expropriation of the investments because the value of LG&E\u2019s holdings in the Licenses has been reduced by more than 90% as a result of Respondent\u2019s abrogation of the principal guarantees of the tariff system (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6 180).\n\n178.\n\nLG&E contends that, pursuant to Article IV of the Bilateral Treaty, it is entitled to compensation equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation was committed. Claimants pinpoint the date of expropriation in this case as the date on which Respondent\u2019s course of conduct finally resulted in the virtual destruction of the value of the investment -not later than August 2000, when the Argentine court enjoined implementation of the 17 July 2000 agreement and any further PPI adjustments (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, 181).\n\n179.\n\nUnder Claimants\u2019 theory, indirect expropriation occurs when government action substantially impairs the value of an investment (Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 53 *citing* Dolzer Reb., 56). In this case, the Claimants consider that the Argentine Government\u2019s actions had a substantial effect on LG&E\u2019s shares in the Licensees, which are an investment protected under Article I(1)(a) of the Treaty. The value of LG&E\u2019s investment was based on a tariff system and depended on the Respondent respecting the system. The value of LG&E\u2019s shares in the Licensees now fluctuates according to general speculation around the future tariff relief that Argentina may or may not grant (Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, 53).\n\n180.\n\nClaimants add that when it comes to establishing whether there was effectively an indirect expropriation, there is no relevance to the fact that the Licensees continue to operate or control their gas-distribution business, or as to whether Claimants hold title to the shares. In the case of indirect expropriation, it does not matter whether title to the licenses has been transferred to the State. It is enough to show that their investment has been impaired as a result of government action, which they claim is the case here as there allegedly has been a substantial appropriation of value by the State and transfer of wealth from the gas industry to gas consumers, especially large industrial consumers (Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 53-54).\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent denies that any expropriation under Article IV of the Bilateral Treaty has occurred. Respondent contends that, in order for the Argentine Government to have either directly or indirectly expropriated Claimants\u2019 investment, the measures at issue would have had to have been designed to transfer title to the investment to the State. The sole difference between direct and indirect expropriation in this case, according to Respondent, is that with indirect expropriation, no formal transfer of title is required, since its purpose is that of \"masking, disguising the expropriating event and of eluding the resulting liability\" (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 103).\n\n182.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants have not proven that the PPI\u2019s suspension constitutes an expropriating event. Respondent contends that the suspension of the PPI adjustments would have affected tariffs by approximately 2%, and states that under no circumstance could a tribunal conclude that such a small loss qualifies as an expropriation subject to compensation.\n\n183.\n\nArgentina argues that in any event there could not have been any expropriation during the economic crisis. The fact that the licensees may have been affected by the crisis, along with everyone else, does not lead to the conclusion that their investment was expropriated. Respondent denies any causal link between the measures adopted by the Argentine State during this time and the fluctuations in the value of LG&E\u2019s shares in the licensees. In its opinion, the fluctuation in the value of LG&E\u2019s investment is attributable to the \"macroeconomic conditions affecting the Argentine Republic\", rather than the measures adopted by the Argentine State (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 109). Argentina points out that between 1997 and 2000, LG&E earned higher income than expected through its investments in the licensees.\n\n184.\n\nFinally, after objecting the expropriation claim because the company remains de facto and by law the owner of the investment, Respondent alleges that, in fact, the share prices of Claimants\u2019 investment have increased in value from the period immediately preceding the suspension of the PPI adjustments. As such, Respondent argues that where property is worth more today than it was prior to the measures\u2019 adoption, the property may not be deemed expropriated (Respondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6110-111).\n\n**2. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n185.\n\nIn order to establish the sustainability of an indirect expropriation, the Tribunal must define the concept. Generally, bilateral treaties do not define what constitutes an expropriation -they just make an express reference to \"expropriation\" and add the language \"any other action that has equivalent effects.\" Likewise, Article IV of the Bilateral Treaty does not define the term \"expropriation\" and does not establish which measures, actions or conduct would constitute acts \"tantamount to expropriation.\" Therefore, the Tribunal shall look to international law in determining the relevant criteria for evaluating this claim.\n\n186.\n\nA State may, at its discretion, under Article IV of the Bilateral Treaty and in accordance with general principles of international law, make use of its sovereign power to expropriate private property with the purpose of satisfying a public interest. However, expropriation in any of its modalities requires due process and compensation under international law.\n\n187.\n\nAlthough in scholarly authority two kinds of expropriation are known, we will obviously skip the direct one, understood as the forcible appropriation by the State of the tangible or intangible property of individuals by means of administrative or legislative action. The parties admit that the claim at issue does not involve a direct expropriation. In the case of the Argentine Republic, one could not say that it appropriated Claimants\u2019 investment, which is the indispensable requirement if one is to talk of direct expropriation. Instead, we shall limit ourselves to the assumption of the indirect expropriation, one qualified by the Bilateral Treaty itself as \"measures tantamount to expropriation.\"\n\n188.\n\nGenerally, the expression \"equivalent to expropriation\" or \"tantamount to expropriation\" found in most bilateral treaties, may refer both, to the so-called \"creeping expropriation\" and to the **de facto** expropriation. Their common point rests in the fact that the host State\u2019s actions or conduct do not involve \"overt taking\" but the taking occurs when governmental measures have \"effectively neutralize[d] the benefit of property of the foreign owner.\"51 Ownership or enjoyment can be said to be \"neutralized\" where a party no longer is in control of the investment, or where it cannot direct the day-to-day operations of the investment.52 As to the differences, it is usual to say that indirect expropriation may show itself in a gradual or growing form \u2014creeping expropriation\u2014 or through a sole and unique action, or through actions being quite close in time or simultaneous \u2014 **de facto** expropriation.\n\n*CME Czech Republic v. Czech Republic,* Partial Award, \u00b6 604 (13 September 2001).\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Canada,* Interim Award, \u00b6 100 (26 June 2000).\n\n189.\n\nIn order to establish whether State measures constitute expropriation under Article IV(1) of the Bilateral Treaty, the Tribunal must balance two competing interests: the degree of the measure\u2019s interference with the right of ownership and the power of the State to adopt its policies.\n\n190.\n\nIn evaluating the degree of the measure\u2019s interference with the investor\u2019s right of ownership, one must analyze the measure\u2019s economic impact - its interference with the investor\u2019s reasonable expectations - and the measure\u2019s duration.\n\n191.\n\nIn considering the severity of the economic impact, the analysis focuses on whether the economic impact unleashed by the measure adopted by the host State was sufficiently severe as to generate the need for compensation due to expropriation. In many arbitral decisions, the compensation has been denied when it has not affected all or almost all the investment\u2019s economic value. Interference with the investment\u2019s ability to carry on its business is not satisfied where the investment continues to operate, even if profits are diminished.53 The impact must be substantial in order that compensation may be claimed for the expropriation.\n\n*Pope & Talbot,* \u00b6\u00b6101-02.\n\n192.\n\nThe tribunal in *Tecmed* required a finding that Claimant had been \"radically deprived of the economical use and enjoyment of its investments, as if the rights related thereto -such as the income or benefits related to the [investment...]- had ceased to exist.\"54 In other words, if due to the actions of the Respondent, the assets involved have lost their value or economic use for the Claimants and the extent of the loss.55\n\n*Tecmed,* \u00b6 115.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n193.\n\nSimilarly, one must consider the duration of the measure as it relates to the degree of interference with the investor\u2019s ownership rights. Generally, the expropriation must be permanent, that is to say, it cannot have a temporary nature, unless the investment\u2019s successful development depends on the realization of certain activities at specific moments that may not endure variations.\n\n194.\n\nThere is no doubt that the facts relating to the severity of the changes on the legal status and the practical impact endured by the investors in this case, as well as the possibility of enjoying the right of ownership and use of the investment are decisive in establishing whether an indirect expropriation is said to have occurred. The question remains as to whether one should only take into account the effects produced by the measure or if one should consider also the context within which a measure was adopted and the host State\u2019s purpose. It is this Tribunal\u2019s opinion that there must be a balance in the analysis both of the causes and the effects of a measure in order that one may qualify a measure as being of an expropriatory nature. It is important not to confound the State\u2019s right to adopt policies with its power to take an expropriatory measure. \"This determination is important because it is one of the main elements to distinguish, from the perspective of an international tribunal between a regulatory measure, which is an ordinary expression of the exercise of the state\u2019s police power that entails a decrease in assets or rights, and a *de facto* expropriation that deprives those assets and rights of any real substance.\"56\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n195.\n\nWith respect to the power of the State to adopt its policies, it can generally be said that the State has the right to adopt measures having a social or general welfare purpose. In such a case, the measure must be accepted without any imposition of liability, except in cases where the State\u2019s action is obviously disproportionate to the need being addressed. The proportionality to be used when making use of this right was recognized in *Tecmed,* which observed that \"whether such actions or measures are proportional to the public interest presumably protected thereby and the protection legally granted to investments, taking into account that the significance of such impact, has a key role upon deciding the proportionality.\"57\n\n*Tecmed,* \u00b6122.\n\n196.\n\nAs is observed by *The American Law Institute \u2019s Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States,* \"a state is not responsible for loss of property or for other economic disadvantage resulting from *bona fide* general taxation, regulation, forfeiture for crime, or other action of the kind that is commonly accepted as within the police power of the states, if it is not discriminatory...\"58. This criterion was used by the Tribunal of Iran-United States of America claims in the *Too v. Greater Modesto Insurance Associates.59*\n\n*Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States,* American Law Institute, Volume 1, 1987, Section 712, Comment g.\n\n*Too v. Greater Modesto Insurance Associates,* 23 Iran-United States Cl. Trib. Rep. 378, Award of December 29, 1989.\n\n197.\n\nAs was stated in the *Oscar Chinn* affair of 1934, adopted by the Permanent Court of International Justice:\n\n\"No enterprise... can escape from the chances and hazards resulting from general economic conditions. Some industries may be able to make large profits during a period of general prosperity, or else by taking advantages of a treaty of commerce or of an alteration in customs duties; but they are also exposed to the danger of ruin or extinction if circumstances change. Where this is the case, no vested rights are violated by the State.\"60\n\n*Oscar Chinn* affair, P.C.I.J, 1934, Ser A/B, Case No. 63.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion**\n----------------------------\n\n198.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, although the State adopted severe measures that had a certain impact on Claimants\u2019 investment, especially regarding the earnings that the Claimants expected, such measures did not deprive the investors of the right to enjoy their investment. As in *Pope & Talbot,* the true interests at stake here are the investment\u2019s asset base, the value of which has rebounded since the economic crisis of December 2001 and 2002.\n\n199.\n\nFurther, it cannot be said that Claimants lost control over their shares in the licensees, even though the value of the shares may have fluctuated during the economic crisis, or that they were unable to direct the day-to-day operations of the licensees in a manner different than before the measures were implemented.\n\n200.\n\nThus, the effect of the Argentine State\u2019s actions has not been permanent on the value of the Claimants\u2019 shares\u2019, and Claimants\u2019 investment has not ceased to exist. Without a permanent, severe deprivation of LG&E\u2019s rights with regard to its investment, or almost complete deprivation of the value of LG&E\u2019s investment, the Tribunal concludes that these circumstances do not constitute expropriation.\n\n**E. State of Necessity**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n201.\n\nRespondent contends in the alternative that, if Argentina would have breached its Treaty obligations, the state of political, economic and social crisis that befell Argentina allowed it to take action contrary to the obligations it had assumed with respect to the gas-distribution licensees. Thus, even if the measures adopted by the State in order to overcome the economic crisis suffered during the years 1998 through 2003, resulted in a violation of the rights guaranteed under the Treaty to foreign investments, such measures were implemented under a state of necessity and therefore, Argentina is excused from liability during this period.\n\n202.\n\nRespondent pleads its defense as a \"state of necessity\" defense, available under Argentine law, Treaty in Articles XI and IV(3), as well as customary international law.\n\n203.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent\u2019s contentions regarding the alleged state of necessity defense. Claimants contend that Article XI is not applicable in the case of an economic crisis because the public order and essential security interests elements are intentionally narrow in scope, limited to security threats of a physical nature.\n\n**2. General Comments on Article XI**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Preliminary Considerations**\n----------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nArticle XI of the Bilateral Treaty provides:\n\n\"This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.\"\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s analysis to determine the applicability of Article XI of the Bilateral Treaty is twofold. First, the Tribunal must decide whether the conditions that existed in Argentina during the relevant period were such that the State was entitled to invoke the protections included in Article XI of the Treaty. Second, the Tribunal must determine whether the measures implemented by Argentina were necessary to maintain public order or to protect its essential security interests, albeit in violation of the Treaty.61\n\nRespondent has not relied upon the third element of Article XI, \"the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security.\"\n\n206.\n\nThe Tribunal reiterates that to carry out the two-fold analysis already mentioned, it shall apply first, the Treaty, second, the general international law to the extent that is necessary and third, the Argentine domestic law. The Tribunal underscores that the claims and defenses mentioned derive from the Treaty and that, to the extent required for the interpretation and application of its provisions, the general international law shall be applied (See section V. B *supra).*\n\n**(ii) The Question of Whether Article XI is Self-Judging**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nBefore turning to its substantive analysis of Article XI, the Tribunal must determine whether Article XI is *self-judging.*\n\n208.\n\nRespondent has argued that because Article XI is a self-judging provision, it is for the State to make a good faith determination as to what measures are necessary for the maintenance of public order, or the protection of its essential security interests. According to Respondent, under this self-judging exception, the Tribunal must decide only whether Argentina acted in good faith or not.\n\n209.\n\nRespondent considers Article XI is ambiguous and characterizes such ambiguity as a \"strategic ambiguity\" on the part of the United States, since it does not clearly define who should determine if the measures to maintain public order or protect essential security interests are necessary. Respondent recognizes that the United States\u2019 1987 Model BIT, upon which the Argentina-U.S. BIT was based, does not clarify the United States\u2019 position, nor does any of the documentation related to the negotiation or ratification of the Argentina-U.S. BIT. However, Respondent contends that subsequent to the conclusion of the Argentina-U.S. BIT, the United States shifted its position permanently with regard to essential security clauses, stating in 1992 that the United States considered such clauses to be self-judging, presently and retroactively (Slaughter Witness Statement, \u00b6\u00b612-31).\n\n210.\n\nClaimants disagree that Article XI is self-judging, and argue instead that its application requires that the Tribunal conduct its own analysis of whether the conditions necessitated measures to maintain public order or protect Argentina\u2019s essential security interests within the meaning of Article XI.\n\n211.\n\nClaimants contend that neither the plain meaning of Article XI, nor the context or purpose of the Treaty suggest that Article XI is self-judging, and that the position of the United States at the time the parties signed the Treaty was that such clauses were not self-judging (Hearing on the Merits, 28 January 2005, Alvarez, Spanish Transcript, p. 925 **et seq.).** Claimants argue that Respondent has not proven that the parties to the Treaty intended Article XI to be self-judging, which they characterize as \"an exceptional thing.\" (Hearing on the Merits, 28 January 2005, Alvarez, Spanish Transcript, p. 932 **et seq.).** Claimants contend that the United States did not consider essential security clauses as self-judging until the Russia-U.S. BIT of 1992 and the 1992 U.S. Model BIT, both of which post-date the Argentina-U.S. BIT, and both of which noted explicitly the change in the United States\u2019 policy that these provisions were to be self-judging.\n\n212.\n\nCertainly, the language of the BIT does not specify who should decide what constitutes essential security measures -either Argentina itself, subject to a review under a good faith standard, or the Tribunal. Based on the evidence before the Tribunal regarding the understanding of the Parties in 1991 at the time the Treaty was signed, the Tribunal decides and concludes that the provision is not self-judging.\n\n213.\n\nThe provisions included in the international treaty are to be interpreted in conformity with the interpretation given and agreed upon by both parties at the time of its signature, unless both parties agreed to its modification. In that case, the date to be considered is November 1991. It is not until 1992, with the ratification of the Russia - US BIT, that the United States begins to consider that the application of the essential security measures are *self judging-,* both instruments post-date the bilateral treaty between the United States and the Argentine Republic and, in both cases, this change was explicitly clarified.\n\n214.\n\nWere the Tribunal to conclude that the provision is self-judging, Argentina\u2019s determination would be subject to a good faith review anyway, which does not significantly differ from the substantive analysis presented here.\n\n**(iii) Necessary Nature of the Measures Adopted**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-------------------------\n\n215.\n\nArgentina defends the measures it implemented as necessary to maintain public order and protect its essential security interests. It contends that under any interpretation, the financial crisis, riots and chaos of the years 2000 through 2002 in Argentina constitute a national emergency sufficient to invoke the protections of Article XI (Slaughter Witness Statement, \u00b6 45).\n\n216.\n\nConcerning \"public order\", Respondent reinforces its arguments on the necessary nature of the measures it had implemented by pointing to numerous reports of waves of sudden economic catastrophe, massive strikes involving millions of workers, fatal shootings, the shut down of schools, businesses, transportation, energy, banking and health services, demonstrations across the country, and a plummeting stock market, culminating in a \"final massive social explosion\" in which five presidential administrations resigned within a month (Slaughter Witness Statement, 46-49). Under these circumstances, Argentina argues that price controls by the Argentine Government would have been fully justifiable under the public order provisions of Article XI. Additionally, Respondent argues that actions to freeze price increases in the gas-distribution sector were justifiable to maintain the country\u2019s basic infrastructure, which was dependent on natural gas energy.\n\n217.\n\nArgentina also defends its measures as necessary to protect its essential security interests. Argentina asserts that Article XI\u2019s \"essential security interests\" element encompasses economic and political interests, as well as national military defense interests. Respondent cites several United States\u2019 officials who have propounded a broad interpretation of \"essential security interests\" (Slaughter Witness Statement, \u00b6 38).\n\n218.\n\nRespondent attacks Claimants\u2019 basis for asserting that the clause is narrow, reserved only for military actions. Furthermore, in all of the cases cited by Claimants, the point was whether the use of military force was justifiable under international law - a narrow reading of essential security clauses in these cases would be expected.\n\n219.\n\nBecause economic stability, in Respondent\u2019s view, falls within a State\u2019s essential security interests, Respondent defends the measures it took as necessary to protect its economic interests. Respondent argues that during the crisis period, the health, safety and security of the Argentine State and its people were threatened, and that the economic melt-down had the potential to cause catastrophic state failure. Thus, the public emergency that Argentina declared and the Emergency Law the Government passed altering its financial arrangements were necessary to protect the State\u2019s essential security interests.\n\n220.\n\nClaimants identify the four measures at issue here -suspension and abolishment of the PPI adjustment, freezing the gas-distribution tariffs, and abandonment of the calculation of the tariffs in dollars, all taken unilaterally- and contend that Respondent must prove that each measure was necessary in order to maintain public order and protect Argentina\u2019s essential security interests (Reply, \u00b6 209). By the term \"necessary,\" Claimants contend that these measures must have been the only option available to Argentina in order to invoke protection under Article XI.\n\n221.\n\nClaimants define public order measures as \"actions taken pursuant to a state\u2019s police powers, particularly in respect of public health and safety\". Based on this definition, Claimants state that the measures in dispute in this case were not aimed at bringing calmness to the collapse that was threatening the country. Consequently, such measures cannot be deemed necessary to maintain public order.\n\n222.\n\nWith respect to \"essential security interests,\" Claimants reiterate that such interests do not include economic interests -only defense or military concerns. They compare a State\u2019s interest in essential security to a national security threat, while a \"national emergency,\" the alleged circumstance in which Respondent invokes the protection, has an entirely different meaning. In Claimants\u2019 view, economic crises should not be elevated to an essential security interest, and that doing so would disregard the object and purpose of the Treaty. They argue that an economic crisis is precisely when investors need the protections offered by a BIT.\n\n223.\n\nClaimants argue that in any event, Article XI does not relieve Argentina of its obligations to compensate Claimants for damages suffered as a result of breaches of the Treaty.\n\n224.\n\nClaimants also reject the possibility of applying the rule provided by Article IV(3) of the Treaty. They are of the opinion that this provision does not apply to economic crises, and it does not authorize the host State to revoke or suspend the protections given to foreign investors (Reply, 229).\n\n225.\n\nClaimants invoke Article 27 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on State Responsibility. Claimants contend that even if the state of necessity defense is available to Argentina under the circumstances of this case, Article 27 of the Draft Articles makes clear that Argentina\u2019s obligations to Claimants are not extinguished and Argentina must compensate Claimants for losses incurred as a result of the Government\u2019s actions. Article 27 provides that \"invocation of a circumstance precluding wrongfulness in accordance with this chapter is without prejudice to (a) compliance with the obligation in question... (b) the question of compensation for any material loss caused by the act in question\" (Reply, 226-228).\n\n**b. Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n--------------------------\n\n226.\n\nIn the judgment of the Tribunal, from 1 December 2001 until 26 April 2003, Argentina was in a period of crisis during which it was necessary to enact measures to maintain public order and protect its essential security interests.\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the initial date for the state of necessity is the effective date of the Emergency Law, 6 January 2002, because, in the first place, the emergency had already started when the law was enacted. Second, should the Tribunal take as the initial date the day when the Emergency Law became effective, it might be reasonable to take as its closing date the day when the state of emergency is lifted by the Argentine State, a fact that has not yet taken place since the law has been extended several times.\n\n228.\n\nIt is to be pointed out that there is a factual emergency that began on 1 December 2001 and ended on 26 April 2003, on account of the reasons detailed below, as well as a legislative emergency, that begins and ends with the enactment and abrogation of the Emergency Law, respectively. It should be borne in mind that Argentina declared its state of necessity and has extended such state until the present. Indeed, the country has issued a record number of decrees since 1901, accounting for the fact that the emergency periods in Argentina have been longer than the non-emergency periods. Emergency periods should be only strictly exceptional and should be applied exclusively when faced with extraordinary circumstances. Hence, in order to allege state of necessity as a State defense, it will be necessary to prove the existence of serious public disorders. Based on the evidence available, the Tribunal has determined that the situation ended at the time President Kirchner was elected.\n\n229.\n\nThus, Argentina is excused under Article XI from liability for any breaches of the Treaty between 1 December 2001 and 26 April 2003. The reasons are the following:\n\n230.\n\nThese dates coincide, on the one hand, with the Government\u2019s announcement of the measure freezing funds, which prohibited bank account owners from withdrawing more than one thousand pesos monthly and, on the other hand, with the election of President Kirchner. The Tribunal marks these dates as the beginning and end of the period of extreme crisis in view of the notorious events that occurred during this period.\n\n231.\n\nEvidence has been put before the Tribunal that the conditions as of December 2001 constituted the highest degree of public disorder and threatened Argentina\u2019s essential security interests. This was not merely a period of \"economic problems\" or \"business cycle fluctuation\" as Claimants described (Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 14). Extremely severe crises in the economic, political and social sectors reached their apex and converged in December 2001, threatening total collapse of the Government and the Argentine State.\n\n232.\n\nAll of the major economic indicators reached catastrophic proportions in December 2001. An accelerated deterioration of Argentina\u2019s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) began in December 2001, falling 10 to 15 percent faster than the previous year. Private consumption dramatically dropped in the fourth quarter of 2001, accompanied by a severe drop in domestic prices. Argentina experienced at this time widespread decline in the prices and in the value of assets located in Argentina. The Merval Index, which measures the share value of the main companies of Argentina listed on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, experienced a dramatic decline of 60% by the end of December 2001. By mid-2001, Argentina\u2019s country risk premium was the highest premium worldwide, rendering Argentina unable to borrow on the international markets, and reflecting the severity of the economic crisis.\n\n233.\n\nAt this time, capital outflow was a critical problem for the Government. In the fourth quarter of 2001, the Central Bank of Argentina lost US$ 11 billion in liquid reserves, amounting to 40%. The banking system lost 25% of its total deposits.\n\n234.\n\nWhile unemployment, poverty and indigency rates gradually increased from the beginning of 1998, they reached intolerable levels by December 2001. Unemployment reached almost 25%, and almost half of the Argentine population was living below poverty. The entire healthcare system teetered on the brink of collapse. Prices of pharmaceuticals soared as the country plunged deeper into the deflationary period, becoming unavailable for low-income people. Hospitals suffered a severe shortage of basic supplies. Investments in infrastructure and equipment for public hospitals declined as never before. These conditions prompted the Government to declare the nationwide health emergency to ensure the population\u2019s access to basic health care goods and services. At the time, one quarter of the population could not afford the minimum amount of food required to ensure their subsistence. Given the level of poverty and lack of access to healthcare and proper nutrition, disease followed. Facing increased pressure to provide social services and security to the masses of indigent and poor people, the Government was forced to decrease its per capita spending on social services by 74%.\n\n235.\n\nBy December 2001, there was widespread fear among the population that the Government would default on its debt and seize bank deposits to prevent the bankruptcy of the banking system. Faced with a possible run on banks, the Government issued on 1 December 2001 Decree of Necessity and Emergency No. 1570/01. The law triggered widespread social discontent. Widespread violent demonstrations and protests brought the economy to a halt, including effectively shutting down transportation systems. Looting and rioting followed in which tens of people were killed as the conditions in the country approached anarchy. A curfew was imposed to curb lootings.\n\n236.\n\nBy 20 December 2001, President De la Rua resigned. His presidency was followed by a succession of presidents over the next days, until Mr. Eduardo Duhalde took office on 1 January 2002, charged with the mandate to bring the country back to normal conditions.\n\n237.\n\nAll of these devastating conditions -economic, political, social- in the aggregate triggered the protections afforded under Article XI of the Treaty to maintain order and control the civil unrest.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the notion that Article XI is only applicable in circumstances amounting to military action and war. Certainly, the conditions in Argentina in December 2001 called for immediate, decisive action to restore civil order and stop the economic decline. To conclude that such a severe economic crisis could not constitute an essential security interest is to diminish the havoc that the economy can wreak on the lives of an entire population and the ability of the Government to lead. When a State\u2019s economic foundation is under siege, the severity of the problem can equal that of any military invasion.\n\n239.\n\nClaimants contend that the necessity defense should not be applied here because the measures implemented by Argentina were not the only means available to respond to the crisis. The Tribunal rejects this assertion. Article XI refers to situations in which a State has no choice but to act. A State may have several responses at its disposal to maintain public order or protect its essential security interests. In this sense, it is recognized that Argentina\u2019s suspension of the calculation of tariffs in U.S. dollars and the PPI adjustment of tariffs was a legitimate way of protecting its social and economic system.\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that Argentina\u2019s enactment of the Emergency Law was a necessary and legitimate measure on the part of the Argentine Government. Under the conditions the Government faced in December 2001, time was of the essence in crafting a response. Drafted in just six days, the Emergency Law took the swift, unilateral action against the economic crisis that was necessary at the time (Hearing on the Merits, 25 January 2005, Ratti, Spanish Transcript, pp. 415-419).\n\n241.\n\nIn drafting the Emergency Law, the Government considered the interests of the foreign investors, and concluded that it \"could not leave sectors of the economy operating with the brutally dollarized economy -[the] system was in crisis, so we had to cut off that process, and we had to establish a new set of rules for everybody.\" (Hearing on the Merits, 25 January 2005, Ratti, Spanish Transcript, p. 417). Argentina\u2019s strategy to deal with the thousands of public utility contracts that could not be individually assessed during the period of crisis was to implement \"across-the-board solutions\" and then renegotiate the contracts (Hearing on the Merits, 26 January 2005, Roubini, Spanish Transcript, p. 635). The Tribunal accepts the necessity of approaching enactment of a stop-gap measure in this manner and therefore rejects Claimants\u2019 objection that Argentina\u2019s unilateral response was not necessary.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the provisions of the Emergency Law that abrogated calculation of the tariffs in U.S. dollars and PPI adjustments, as well as freezing tariffs were necessary measures to deal with the extremely serious economic crisis. Indeed, it would be unreasonable to conclude that during this period the Government should have implemented a tariff increase pursuant to an index pegged to an economy experiencing a high inflationary period (the United States). The severe devaluation of the peso against the dollar renders the Government\u2019s decision to abandon the calculation of tariffs in dollars reasonable. Similarly, the Government deemed that freezing gas tariffs altogether during the crisis period was necessary, and Claimants have not provided any reason as to why such measure would not provide immediate relief from the crisis.\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal will now turn to Article IV(3) of the Treaty, which provides:\n\n\"Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, *state of national emergency,* insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded treatment by such other Party no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n244.\n\nArticle IV(3) of the Treaty confirms that the States Party to the Bilateral Treaty contemplated the state of national emergency as a separate category of exceptional circumstances. That is in line with the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of Article XI of the Treaty. Furthermore, the Tribunal has determined, as a factual matter that the grave crisis in Argentina lasted from 1 December 2001 until 26 April 2003. It has not been shown convincingly to the Tribunal that during that period the provisions of Article IV(3) of the Treaty have been violated by Argentina. On the contrary, during that period, the measures taken by Argentina were \"across the board.\"\n\n245.\n\nIn the previous analysis, the Tribunal has determined that the conditions in Argentina from 1 December 2001 until 26 April 2003 were such that Argentina is excused from liability for the alleged violation of its Treaty obligations due to the responsive measures it enacted. The concept of excusing a State for the responsibility for violation of its international obligations during what is called a \"state of necessity\" or \"state of emergency\" also exists in international law. While the Tribunal considers that the protections afforded by Article XI have been triggered in this case, and are sufficient to excuse Argentina\u2019s liability, the Tribunal recognizes that satisfaction of the state of necessity standard as it exists in international law (reflected in Article 25 of the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles on State Responsibility) supports the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion.62\n\nArticle 25 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts provides:  \n 1. \"Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:  \n a) Is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and  \n b) Does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.  \n 2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:  \n a) The international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or  \n b) The State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\"  \n The ILC\u2019s Draft Articles, after some debate regarding the original prepared under the auspices of the Society of Nations in 1930, was abandoned and then resumed by the General Assembly in 1963. Its definitive version, due mainly to the works of Mssrs. Roberto Ago, Willem Riphagen and Gaetano arango-Ruiz, was approved in 1981 and subject to a revision in 1998, which was approved in 2001, during the 85th plenary session of the United Nations\u2019 General Assembly. (Session dated 12 December 2001, during the fifty-sixth session, Agenda item 162 of the Program, A/RES/56/83).\n\n246.\n\nIn international law, a state of necessity is marked by certain characteristics that must be present in order for a State to invoke this defense. As articulated by Roberto Ago, one of the mentors of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility, a state of necessity is identified by those conditions in which a State is threatened by a serious danger to its existence, to its political or economic survival, to the possibility of maintaining its essential services in operation, to the preservation of its internal peace, or to the survival of part of its territory.63 In other words, the State must be dealing with interests that are essential or particularly important.64\n\nUnited Nations, Report A/CN.4/318/ADD.5, p. 3.\n\nStrupp. K., *Les r\u00e8gles g\u00e9n\u00e9rales du Droit de la paix,* Recueil des Cours, 1934 I, T. 47, pp. 259-595, especially p. 568. Similarly, the ILC has defined the state of necessity as that situation where the only means of safeguarding an essential interest of the State against a grave and imminent peril is an act that is not in conformity with an international obligation binding that State with another State. In shaping the concept of state of necessity, one must make a compulsory reference to the Russian seal furs case. There, the Russian government banned the hunting of seals near the Russian shorelines, including international waters and founded such decision on the absolute need to adopt immediate provisional measures. In a communication addressed, on the occasion of this incident, by the Russian foreign Minister, Chickline, to the British Ambassador, Morier, the main elements of the state of necessity were established: the absolutely exceptional nature of the alleged situation; the imminent character of the threat against an important State interest; the impossibility of avoiding the risk with other means, and the necessarily temporary nature of this justification, linked to the due danger\u2019s persistence. *See* United Nations, Report of the International Law Commission on the work performed during its 32nd session, p. 87.\n\n247.\n\nThe United Nations Organization has understood that the invocation of a state of necessity depends on the concurrent existence of three circumstances, namely: a danger to the survival of the State, and not for its interests, is necessary; that danger must not have been created by the acting State; finally, the danger should be serious and imminent, so that there are no other means of avoiding it.\n\n248.\n\nThe concept of state of necessity and the requirements for its admissibility lead to the idea of prevention: the State covers itself against the risk of suffering certain damages. Hence, the possibility of alleging the state of necessity is closely bound by the requirement that there should be a serious and imminent threat and no means to avoid it. Such circumstances, in principle, have been left to the State\u2019s subjective appreciation, a conclusion accepted by the International Law Commission. Nevertheless, the Commission was well aware of the fact that this exception, requiring admissibility, has been frequently abused by States, thus opening up a very easy opportunity to violate the international law with impunity. The Commission has set in its Draft Articles on State Responsibility very restrictive conditions to account for its admissibility, reducing such subjectivity.65\n\nUnited Nations, Report A/CN.4/315, p. 78.\n\n249.\n\nJames Crawford, who was rapporteur of the Draft Articles approved in 2001, noted that when a State invokes the state of necessity, it has full knowledge of the fact that it deliberately chooses a procedure that does not abide an international obligation.66 This deliberate action on the part of the State is therefore subject to the requirements of Article 25 of the Draft Articles, which must concur jointly and without which it is not possible to exclude under international law the wrongfulness of a State\u2019s act that violates an international obligation.\n\nCrawford, James, *Second Report on State Responsibility,* UN General Assembly, International Law Commission, 51st Session, Geneva, 23 July 1999, A/CN.4/498/Add 2, p. 27-28.\n\n250.\n\nTaking each element in turn, Article 25 requires first that the act must be the only means available to the State in order to protect an interest. According to S.P. Jagota, a member of the Commission, such requirement implies that it has not been possible for the State to \"avoid by any other means, even a much more onerous one that could have been adopted and maintained the respect of international obligations. The State must have exhausted all possible legal means before being forced to act as it does.\"67 Any act that goes beyond the limits of what is strictly necessary \"may not be considered as no longer being, as such, a wrongful act, even if justification of the necessity may have been admitted.\"68\n\nUnited Nations, Report A/CN.4/SER.A/1980, pp. 155 and 175.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n251.\n\nThe interest subject to protection also must be essential for the State. What qualifies as an \"essential\" interest is not limited to those interests referring to the State\u2019s existence. As evidence demonstrates, economic, financial or those interests related to the protection of the State against any danger seriously compromising its internal or external situation, are also considered essential interests. Roberto Ago has stated that essential interests include those related to \"different matters such as the economy, ecology or other.\"69 Julio Barboza affirmed that the threat to an essential interest would be identified by considering, among other things, \"a serious threat against the existence of the State, against its political or economic survival, against the maintenance of its essential services and operational possibilities, or against the conservation of internal peace or its territory\u2019s ecology.\"70\n\nUnited Nations, Report A/CN.4/SER.A/1980, p.174.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n252.\n\nJames Crawford has stated that no opinion may be offered *a priori* of \"essential interest,\" but one should understand that it is not the case of the State\u2019s \"existence\", since the \"purpose of the positive law of self-defense is to safeguard that existence.\"71 Thus, an interest\u2019s greater or lesser essential, must be determined as a function of the set of conditions in which the State finds itself under specific situations. The requirement is to appreciate the conditions of each specific case where an interest is in play, since what is essential cannot be predetermined in the abstract72\n\nCrawford, James, *Second Report on State Responsibility, op. cit.,* p. 30.\n\n*Ibidem.*\n\n253.\n\nThe interest must be threatened by a serious and imminent danger. The threat, according to Roberto Ago, \"must be \u2018extremely grave\u2019 and \u2018imminent.\u2019\"73 In this respect, James Crawford has opined that the danger must be established objectively and not only deemed possible74 It must be imminent in the sense that it will soon occur.\n\nUnited Nations, Report A/CN.4/318/ADD.5-7. p. 20.\n\nCrawford, James, *Second Report on State Responsibility op. cit.,* p. 31. In fact, this is so reflected in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, adopted by the United Nations\u2019 Conference on Environment and Development in 1992.\n\n254.\n\nThe action taken by the State may not seriously impair another State\u2019s interest. In this respect, the Commission has observed that the interest sacrificed for the sake of necessity must be, evidently, less important than the interest sought to be preserved through the action.75 The idea is to prevent against the possibility of invoking the state of necessity only for the safeguard of a non-essential interest.\n\nUnited Nations, Report A/CN.4/318/ADD.5-7. p. 20.\n\n255.\n\nThe international obligation at issue must allow invocation of the state of necessity. The inclusion of an article authorizing the state of necessity in a Bilateral Investment Treaty constitutes the acceptance, in the relations between States, of the possibility that one of them may invoke the state of necessity.\n\n256.\n\nThe State must not have contributed to the production of the state of necessity. It seems logical that if the State has contributed to cause the emergency, it should be prevented from invoking the state of necessity. If there is fault by the State, the exception disappears, since in such case the causal relationship between the State\u2019s act and the damage caused is produced. The Tribunal considers that, in the first place, Claimants have not proved that Argentina has contributed to cause the severe crisis faced by the country; secondly, the attitude adopted by the Argentine Government has shown a desire to slow down by all the means available the severity of the crisis.\n\n257.\n\nThe essential interests of the Argentine State were threatened in December 2001. It faced an extremely serious threat to its existence, its political and economic survival, to the possibility of maintaining its essential services in operation, and to the preservation of its internal peace. There is no serious evidence in the record that Argentina contributed to the crisis resulting in the state of necessity. In this circumstances, an economic recovery package was the only means to respond to the crisis. Although there may have been a number of ways to draft the economic recovery plan, the evidence before the Tribunal demonstrates that an across-the-board response was necessary, and the tariffs on public utilities had to be addressed. It cannot be said that any other State\u2019s rights were seriously impaired by the measures taken by Argentina during the crisis. Finally, as addressed above, Article XI of the Treaty exempts Argentina of responsibility for measures enacted during the state of necessity.\n\n258.\n\nWhile this analysis concerning Article 25 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility alone does not establish Argentina\u2019s defense, it supports the Tribunal\u2019s analysis with regard to the meaning of Article XI\u2019s requirement that the measures implemented by Argentina had to have been necessary either for the maintenance of public order or the protection of its own essential security interests.\n\n259.\n\nHaving found that the requirements for invoking the state of necessity were satisfied, the Tribunal considers that it is the factor excluding the State from its liability vis-\u00e0-vis the damage caused as a result of the measures adopted by Argentina in response to the severe crisis suffered by the country.\n\n260.\n\nWith regard to Article 27 of the United Nations\u2019 Draft Articles alleged by Claimants, the Tribunal opines that the article at issue does not specifically refer to the compensation for one or all the losses incurred by an investor as a result of the measures adopted by a State during a state of necessity. The commentary introduced by the Special Rapporteur establishes that Article 27 *\"does not attempt to specify in what circumstances compensation would be payable''76* The rule does not specify if compensation is payable during the state of necessity or whether the State should reassume its obligations. In this case, this Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of Article XI of the Treaty provides the answer.\n\nCrawford, James, *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility,* Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 178 *et seq.*\n\n261.\n\nFollowing this interpretation the Tribunal considers that Article XI establishes the state of necessity as a ground for exclusion from wrongfulness of an act of the State, and therefore, the State is exempted from liability. This exception is appropriate only in emergency situations; and once the situation has been overcome, i.e. certain degree of stability has been recovered; the State is no longer exempted from responsibility for any violation of its obligations under the international law and shall reassume them immediately.\n\n**(iv) Consequences of the State of Necessity**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThree relevant issues arise with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s finding Argentina is entitled to invoke the state of necessity as contemplated by Article XI, and general international law.\n\n263.\n\nThe first issue deals with the determination of the period during which the state of necessity occurred. As previously indicated, in the view of the Tribunal, the state of necessity in this case began on 1 December 2001 and ended on 26 April 2003, when President Kirchner was elected *(see* the Tribunal\u2019s Analysis). All measures adopted by Argentina in breach of the Treaty before77 and after the period during which the state of necessity prevailed, shall have all their effects and shall be taken into account by the Tribunal to estimate the damages.\n\nThe period before the state of necessity initiates with the injunction issued by the Argentine Court on 18 August 2000.\n\n264.\n\nThe second issue related to the effects of the state of necessity is to determine the subject upon which the consequences of the measures adopted by the host State during the state of necessity shall fall. As established in the Tribunal\u2019s Analysis, Article 27 of ILC\u2019s Draft Articles, as well as Article XI of the Treaty, does not specify if any compensation is payable to the party affected by losses during the state of necessity. Nevertheless, and in accordance with that expressed under paragraphs 260 and 261 *supra,* this Tribunal has decided that the damages suffered during the state of necessity should be borne by the investor.\n\n265.\n\nThe third issue is related to what Argentina should have done, once the state of necessity was over on 26 April 2003. The very following day (27 April), Argentina\u2019s obligations were once again effective. Therefore, Respondent should have reestablished the tariff scheme offered to LG&E or, at least, it should have compensated Claimants for the losses incurred on account of the measures adopted before and after the state of necessity.\n\n**(v) Conclusions of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nBased on the analysis of the state of necessity, the Tribunal concludes that, first, said state started on 1 December 2001 and ended on 26 April 2003; second, during that period Argentina is exempt of responsibility, and accordingly, the Claimants should bear the consequences of the measures taken by the host State; and finally, the Respondent should have restored the tariff regime on 27 April 2003, or should have compensated the Claimants, which did not occur. As a result, Argentina is liable as from that date to Claimants for damages.\n\n**VII. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL ON LIABILITY**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders its decision, partially granting LG&E\u2019s claims, as follows:\n\na. The claim for expropriation of the investment is hereby dismissed.\n\nb. Argentina breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment, no less favorable treatment than that to be accorded under the international law, and adopted discriminatory measures, causing damage to LG&E. Argentina\u2019s abrogation of the guarantees under the statutory framework, as indicated under paragraph 175 *supra,* violated its obligations to Claimants\u2019 investments, giving rise to liability under the umbrella clause.\n\nc. The standard prohibiting the adoption of arbitrary measures is not deemed to have been violated.\n\nd. Between 1 December 2001 and 26 April 2003, Argentina was in a state of necessity, for which reason it shall be exempted from the payment of compensation for damages incurred during that period.\n\ne. The Argentine Republic is liable for damages to Claimants for the aforementioned violations, except during the period of the state of necessity, which damages, including interest, as well as specification of the periods during which Respondent has incurred in violation of its international obligations, shall be determined in a next phase of the arbitration and in respect of which the Tribunal retains jurisdiction.\n\nf. Any decision on the costs of the arbitration is reserved."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2007-07-25T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 3 October 2006, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Liability (the \"Decision on Liability\"), in which the Tribunal found the Argentine Republic (\"Respondent\" or \"Argentina\") to be in breach of its obligations under the Bilateral Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment (\"BIT\", the \"Bilateral Treaty\" or the \"Treaty\") with respect to (i) the standard of fair and equitable treatment and the prohibition to accord treatment less favorable than that required by international law under Article II(2)(a); (ii) the prohibition of discriminatory measures under Article II(2)(b); and (iii) the obligations covered by the \"umbrella clause\" under Article II(2)(c).\n\n2.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal found that the Respondent\u2019s conduct was justified under the State of Necessity as contemplated by Article XI of the Treaty and general international law. The Respondent was therefore exempted from responsibility while this situation lasted, i.e., from 1 December 2001 until 26 April 2003.\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal consequently determined that Argentina was liable for damages to LG&E Energy Corp. LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. (the \"Claimants\" or \"LG&E\") for breaches of the Treaty, except during the period of the State of Necessity, and retained jurisdiction to determine such damages in a subsequent phase of the arbitration.\n\n4.\n\nOn 3 November 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 in which it invited the parties to comment on the method proposed by the Tribunal to establish the amount of damages suffered by the Claimants. The Secretary of the Tribunal circulated the parties\u2019 comments on 5 December 2006. On 12 April 2007, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed under Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n5.\n\nThis Award deals **exclusively** with the determination of damages including interest (Section II) and costs (Section III). The Decision on Liability, dated 3 October 2006 and the Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, dated 30 April 2004, rendered by this Tribunal, form an integral part of this Award.\n\n6.\n\nIn determining the damages suffered by the Claimants, the Tribunal has considered, together with allegations and evidence submitted by the parties and their experts, the financial and economic expertise provided at its request and with the parties\u2019 consent mainly by Geoffrey Senogles of LBC International Investigative Accounting, Switzerland, and by *Oxford Economic Forecasting.1* The Tribunal wishes to express its gratitude to the experts for their valuable collaboration as well as to the parties and their experts for their thorough allegations.\n\nWith assistance from Vanessa Rossi and Simon Knapp of Oxford Economic Forecasting and also Douglas Glassford.\n\n**II. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n7.\n\nPrior to the issuance of the Decision on Liability, the parties explained at length their position with respect to damages in their submissions and in the expert reports that accompanied them. The arguments on damages were discussed during the Hearing held in Washington D.C. from 23 to 29 January 2005, in which the parties\u2019 experts were also examined. The Post-Hearing Briefs (\"PHB\") of both parties likewise contained allegations on damages.\n\n8.\n\nSubsequently, the parties presented their positions with regard to the Tribunal\u2019s method for establishing the amount of damages suffered by the Claimants, contained in Procedural Order No. 6 (the \"Tribunal\u2019s method\").\n\n9.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal\u2019s analysis for the determination of damages will follow this sequence: it will first present and examine the parties\u2019 general positions on damages that have lead the Tribunal to establish the principles concerning the assessment of compensation that underlie the Tribunal\u2019s method, included in Procedural Order No. 6 (Section A). The Tribunal will then present and examine the parties\u2019 positions concerning the proposed method (Section B), and will finally quantify the amount of compensation (Section C).\n\n**A. The Principles Concerning the Assessment of Damages**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Parties\u2019 General Positions on Damages**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Argentina\u2019s treaty violations substantially eliminated the value of their investment in Distribuidora de Gas del Centro (\"Centro\"), Distribuidora de Gas Cuyana S.A. (\"Cuyana\") and Gas Natural BAN S.A. (\"GasBan\") (together the \"Licensees\"). Consequently, Claimants are entitled to full compensation for the damages sustained, including (i) the full market value of their loss; (ii) pre- and post-Award compound interest at a reasonable commercial rate; and (iii) the costs and expenses associated with the arbitration proceedings (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6184).\n\n11.\n\nIn respect to the value of their loss, Claimants allege that the general principle governing compensation for breaches of international law was set out by the Permanent Court of Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* Case. In accordance with this principle, the Claimants are entitled to compensation that fully eliminates the effects of the Respondent\u2019s breach of its obligations (Claimants\u2019 Memorial at \u00b6\u00b6183-185).\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants explain that full compensation in international law is measured by the fair market value (\"FMV\") of the loss to the investor. In the case of expropriation, the appropriate measure of the Claimants\u2019 loss is the FMV of the investment at the time of expropriation. In the case of the other claims, such measure is the same FMV of the investment minus the residual value (Claimants\u2019 Memorial at \u00b6188).\n\n13.\n\nLG&E alleges that the preferred method to establish the FMV of a publicly-traded corporation is to determine the market value of its shares. The price paid by an investor for a share in an arms-length transaction shortly before the government\u2019s interference with the investment is likewise reliable evidence of the FMV of the asset.\n\n14.\n\nBased upon the opinions of their experts, Professor Eduardo Schwartz and Carlos Lapuerta, Claimants calculate the FMV of their investments in Cuyana and GasBan by using the sale price for their publicly-traded shares. The value of their investment in Centro, which is not publicly traded, was estimated from the stock price information of the three publicly-traded gas distribution companies (GasBan, Cuyana and MetroGAS). The market values were allegedly confirmed by analysis of several large block sales of shares of gas-distribution companies.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 experts estimated the value of LG&E\u2019s investments at US$268 million on 18 August 2000, when the Respondent first breached the Treaty by suspending the PPI adjustment, and US$20 million in October 2002, once trading activity on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange had adjusted to the enactment of the Emergency Law. Consequently, the Claimants allege that compensation for their expropriation claim is in the order of US$268 million and US$248 million (US$268 million minus US$20 million) on their remaining claims (excluding interest and costs) (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6193-194).\n\n16.\n\nClaimants defend that August 2000 and October 2002 are the dates that best reflect the difference in value of LG&E\u2019s investment with and without legal protections. In their opinion, it is pertinent to begin measuring damages from August 2000 because it was at that time that the Argentine Government began to dismantle the legal protections provided by the regulatory framework for the gas-distribution companies. Accordingly, Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s preference for taking November 2001 as the beginning period because, by that time, stock prices were already depressed by Respondent\u2019s breaches of the Treaty, and thus LG&E\u2019s damages would not reflect the previous decline in the value of its stock resulting from Respondent\u2019s breaches and the consequent market uncertainty over the Government\u2019s commitment to the legal protections of the tariff regime (Reply, \u00b6260).\n\n17.\n\nClaimants defend October 2002 as the period by which time the market had accepted that legal protections of the tariffs were no longer to be upheld and that the Government would no longer implement tariff relief or provide compensation. Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s suggestion to use recent stock prices in order to establish the end value of LG&E\u2019s investment. Stock prices subsequent to October 2002 reflect the market speculation over uncertain tariff relief for an industry no longer protected by a stable regulatory framework. In addition, using recent stock prices would allow the Respondent to unfairly benefit from its failure to remedy its breaches and to manipulate stock values in order to reduce damages (Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6257-262).\n\n18.\n\nAt a later stage, and in response to Argentina\u2019s arguments, the Claimants\u2019 experts also performed an abbreviated DCF analysis based on the forecast of the dividends that LG&E would have likely received from its companies up until the end of the Licenses. The net present value of lost dividends was estimated at US$271 million (without pre-Award interest), allegedly confirming the experts\u2019 calculations based on the stock market value (Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b679-80; Schwartz & Lapuerta second rebuttal report p. 17).2\n\nThe value used by the Claimants in their PHB was corrected to reflect the use of 2027 as the date for termination of the Concession.\n\n19.\n\nClaimants emphasize that the destruction of the value of their investment was caused by the Argentine Government\u2019s breach of its legal commitments rather than by economic factors (Claimants\u2019 Reply, \u00b6\u00b6l266-267). LG&E points out that, while the legal protections offered by the tariff regime were still in effect, gas-distribution company stocks remained stable and retained their value despite the recession. In fact, the gas industry suffered no major losses linked to the drop in demand during the economic recession, since it is relatively insensitive to price fluctuations and customers do not readily switch to alternatives. Thus, but for the elimination of the requirement that tariffs be calculated in U.S. dollars *(pesification),* the value of LG&E\u2019s investment would have weathered a devaluation of the peso (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6l98).\n\n20.\n\nFinally, Claimants deny that the country risk premium allegedly included in the gas distribution tariffs provided compensation for the dismantling of the tariff regime. In particular, Claimants note that (i) this premium was not included in the initial tariffs and that, when introduced by ENARGAS in the first tariff review, it applied only to a reduced portion of the tariff; (ii) LG&E\u2019s actual returns were much lower than the cost of equity that ENARGAS calculated for the tariff reviews; and (iii) exonerating the Respondent because investment returns included such a premium would be tantamount to saying that high-risk borrowers may violate their legal obligations without consequence because their lenders may have charged them higher rates (Claimants\u2019 PHB, \u00b6\u00b685-88).\n\n21.\n\nWith regard to interest, Claimants allege that they are entitled to pre-Award interest measured by the one-month interest rate earned on U.S. Treasury Bills, compounded monthly as from August 2000. As to post-Award interest, Claimants will seek appropriate market-based rates when and if required for the enforcement of an unpaid award (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6206).\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent invokes the following grounds to oppose the claim for compensation: (i) the inadequacy of the methods used by the Claimants\u2019 experts to value LG&E\u2019s investment; (ii) the arbitrariness in the choice of valuation dates for LG&E\u2019s investment; (iii) the unjust enrichment of the Claimants; and (iv) the effect of the country risk premium in excluding compensation for the Claimants.\n\n23.\n\nFirstly, in respect to the inadequacy of methods used by the Claimants\u2019 experts to value LG&E\u2019s investment the Respondent argues that: (i) stock prices for GasBan and Cuyana are unreliable due to the illiquidity and volatility of the Argentine market (Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6377-385); (ii) information on MetroGAS and GasBas is not appropriate to estimate the value of Centro given the significant differences between the companies\u2019 business structures, in particular their leverage (Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6391-393); and (iii) of the six arms-length transactions examined by the Claimants\u2019 experts, only three can be referenced to the stock prices current at the time of the transaction and, in all three cases, the difference between the transaction price and the stock prices is considerable (Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6386-388). Alternatively, the Respondent\u2019s expert, Mr. Fabian Bello, proposes the use of DCF as a more appropriate and rigorous method to value the investments (Bello\u2019s Report of September 2004, \u00b6\u00b635-36).\n\n24.\n\nSecondly, as to the dates chosen by the Claimants to perform the valuation of their investment, the Respondent argues that they are arbitrary and chosen to maximize their loss since they compare the best possible trading values with the worst historical trading values (Counter-Memorial, \u00b6366). In particular, the Respondent asserts that (i) the suspension of the PPI did not cause any damage to the Claimants\u2019 investments since the decrease in their value during 2000 and 2001 was the result of the economic recession that affected all assets during that period; the use of August 2000 avoids reflecting such deterioration in value (Counter-Memorial \u00b6367); and (ii) after October 2002 the value of LG&E\u2019s investment increased considerably: by January 2004 the values for Cuyana and Centro exceeded their November 2001 values by 42% and 26% respectively. The 13% decreased in value experienced by GasBan cannot be blame on the Respondent but on the financial policy of the company, notably on it excessive leverage.\n\n25.\n\nConsequently, the Respondent alleges that LG&E\u2019s claims for damages are inadmissible, since no damage has been inflicted, and premature, since the value of the Licensees is exposed to strong fluctuations and is dependant on the result of the renegotiation process (Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6394-395; Rejoinder, \u00b6417).\n\n26.\n\nThirdly, the Respondent argues that compensating the Claimants would result in unjust enrichment because: (i) if compensation for expropriation were conceded, LG&E\u2019s return for the period 1997-2002 would be considerably higher (in excess of 16% per annum) (Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6449-458); and (ii) if compensation for the violation of other Treaty protections is granted, LG&E would be in the \"absurd\" situation in which it would receive an amount higher than that invested and, in addition, would retain its stake in the Licensees (that have increased its overall value since October 2002), being entitled to future dividends (Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6459-466).\n\n27.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s opinion that the country risk premium calculated by ENARGAS and included in the tariffs has already compensated LG&E for the risk of investing in a country like Argentina (Rejoinder. \u00b6\u00b6405-407).\n\n28.\n\nFinally, the Respondent objects to LG&E\u2019s claims concerning interest. In the event that the Tribunal decides to grant the Claimants\u2019 request for interest, they should be simple and not compounded (Counter-Memorial, \u00b6357). In addition, since Claimants received profits during 2000 and 2001, awarding interest from August 2000 would result in double recovery (Rejoinder, \u00b6474).\n\n**(2) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n29.\n\nIt is well established in international law that the most important consequence of the committing of a wrongful act is the obligation for the State to make reparation for the injury caused by that act.3 The questions arise as to the applicable standard and measure of compensation and the method to quantify it.\n\n*Case Concerning Certain German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Germany v. Poland)* (\"Factory at Chorzow\"), Permanent Court of International Justice Proceeding, Merits 1928, P.C.I.J. Series A. No. 17, p.21.\n\n30.\n\nThese questions are particularly thorny when it comes to defining the standard and measure of compensation applicable for treaty breaches other than expropriation. There are no express provisions in the Treaty addressing these issues and preexisting guidance in arbitral jurisprudence is very limited. In establishing the standard of reparation; the measure of compensation; and the method to quantify it applicable in this case, the Tribunal takes recourse to the principles governing reparation under international law and the few precedents in investment treaty arbitration. In the same manner the Tribunal includes the claim for interest as part of the Claimants\u2019 compensation.\n\n(a) *The Applicable Standard for Reparation*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the appropriate standard for reparation under international law is \"full\" reparation as set out by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Factory at Chorzow* case and codified in Article 31 of the International Law Commission Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the *Draft Articles* or *DARS).4* In accordance with the PCIJ, reparation:\n\n\"[...] must, so far as possible wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability have existed if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear [...]\"5\n\nFor an explanation as to the origin of the Draft Articles *see* the Decision on Liability, \u00b6 245 footnote 62.\n\n*Factory at Chorzow,* p. 47.\n\n32.\n\nReparation can thus take the form of restitution or compensation.6 Claimants have requested compensation measured by the fair market value of their loss.7 The Tribunal, however, does not follow Claimants\u2019 request for the measure of compensation for the reasons set out below.\n\nArticle 34 of the DARS also includes satisfaction as a third form of reparation. Satisfaction is, however, irrelevant for the purposes of this case and will not be considered by the Tribunal.\n\nHowever, Claimants, in their comments to Procedural Order No. 6, include a request that resembles restitution and that will be analyzed in the context of the method for the quantification of compensation in section II.B.(2) below.\n\n(b) *The Measure of Compensation*\n---------------------------------\n\n(i) The Inapplicability of Fair Market Value as the Measure of Compensation\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nAt the heart of the Claimants\u2019 argument lies the valuation of their loss by reference to the fair market value of that loss. Respondent do not oppose the use of the FMV, but rather, the method for its estimation.\n\n34.\n\nTo determine the FMV of their loss, the Claimants establish the value of the gas distribution companies (and of LG&E\u2019s investment using the percentage of shares owned) based on stock price and large share purchase values. The only difference in the valuation for the expropriation claim and the other claims is in the subtraction of the residual value in the later case. Argentina proposes DCF as the method to calculate such value but does not conduct a calculation.\n\n35.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this type of valuation is appropriate in cases of expropriation in which the claimants have lost the title to their investment or when interference with property rights has led to a loss equivalent to the total loss of investment. However, this is not the case. The Tribunal rejected the claim for indirect expropriation put forward by the Claimants on the basis that Argentina\u2019s measures:\n\n\"[...] did not deprive the investors of the right to enjoy their investment [...] the true interests at stake here are the investments\u2019 asset base, the value of which has rebounded since the economic crisis of December 2001 and 2002 [...] the effect of the Argentine State\u2019s actions has not been permanent on the value of the Claimants\u2019 shares, and Claimants\u2019 investment has not ceased to exist.\"8\n\nLG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability of October 3, 2006, \u00b6\u00b6 198-200.\n\n36.\n\nFor the Tribunal, compensation in this case cannot be determined by the impact on the asset value; it does not reflect the actual damage incurred by Claimants. The measure of compensation has to be different.\n\n37.\n\nIt may be added that FMV is referred to in Article IV of the Treaty as the measure of compensation in cases of expropriation. The Tribunal considers that its application does not extend similarly to other treaty standards. As noted by the tribunal in *SD Myers* when analysing the analogous situation under NAFTA, the treaty does not state that it applies to all breaches of its provisions but *\"expressly attached it to expropriations.\"9*\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc v. Government of Canada* (\"SD Myers I\"), UNCITRAL Rules, First Partial Award of November 13, 2000, \u00b6307.\n\n38.\n\nFurthermore, there may be a difference between \"compensation\" as the consequence of a legal act and \"damages\" as the consequence of the committing of a wrongful act.10 This distinction has been noticed by various tribunals.11 If FMV is not the proper measure of compensation for unlawful expropriation, it is *a fortiori* not appropriate for breaches of other Treaty standards.\n\nMarboe, Irmgard, *Compensation and Damages in International Law. The Limits of \"Fair Market Value\",* The Journal of World Investment and Trade, October 2006, Vol. 7 No. 5, p. 726. The Tribunal wishes to highlight the general lack of consistency in the use of the terms \"compensation\" and \"damages\" noted by Marboe. In spite of their different connotations, they are used interchangeably and normally not linked to a specific legal subject matter. The result is that the different legal concepts behind the terms are mixed, creating confusion. This lack of clarity seems to have been aggravated by the fact that the ILC in its DARS chose the term \"compensation\" for the consequence of an illegal act of the State. *See* Marboe, pp. 723-726.\n\n*See e.g.* *AGIP S.p.A. v. People\u2019s Republic of the Congo,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/77/1), Award of November 30, 1979, 1 ICSID Reports \u00b695 (1993); *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), Award of May 20, 1992, 3 ICSID Reports, \u00b6183 (1995) 189; *Amoco International Finance Corp. v. Islamic Republic of Iran* (Partial Award), 15 Iran -US CTR 189 (1987-11), 27 ILM 1314 \u00b6265 (1987); *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. The Republic of Hungary,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16), Award of October 2, 2006, \u00b6481.\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, however, that when addressing the question of the absence of applicable treaty compensation standards for breaches other than expropriation, recent tribunals have opted to apply FMV. Yet, their decisions were grounded on the correspondence between the situation under analysis and expropriation. In *Azurix v. Argentina* the tribunal decided that \" *compensation based on the fair market value of the Concession would be appropriate, particularly since the Province has taken it over.\"12* The tribunal in *CMS v. Argentina* noted that \" *While this standard* [FMV] *figures prominently in respect to expropriation, it is not excluded that it might also be appropriate for breaches different from expropriation if their effect results in important long-term losses.* \"13 The Tribunal considers that the situation in *Azurix* is different from that of LG&E because the Licenses, the main asset of the Licensees, are still in force. With respect to *CMS,* the Tribunal is of the view that *\"important long-term losses\"* in the circumstances of this case are too uncertain and have not been adequately proven.\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* (\"Azurix\"), (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award of July 14, 2006, \u00b6424.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmissions Company v Argentine Republic* (\"CMS\"), (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of May 12, 2005, \u00b6410.\n\n40.\n\nApart from Article IV, no other provision of the Treaty deals with issues of compensation. The silence of a treaty in this respect has been interpreted as an indication of the intention of the parties *\"to leave it open to tribunals to determine a measure of compensation appropriate to the specific circumstances of the case, taking into account the principles of both international law and the provisions of the NAFTA.\"14* On the basis of this discretion, the Tribunal now turns to the determination of the applicable measure of compensation in this case.\n\n*See S.D. Myers, Inc v. Government of Canada* (\"SD Myers II\"), UNCITRAL Rules, Second Partial Award of October 21, 2002, \u00b6309 ; *Marvin Roy Feldman v. United Mexican States* (\"Feldman\"), (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/l), Award of December 16, 2002, \u00b6195.\n\n(ii) The \"Actual Loss\" Incurred \"As a Result\" of the Wrongful Acts as the Appropriate Measure of Compensation\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nPursuant to Article 36 of the DARS *\"[t]he State is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby\"* and compensation *\"shall cover all financially assessable damage including loss of profits in so far as it is established.\"* The determination of compensation depends on the identification of the damage caused by Respondent\u2019s wrongful acts and the establishment of lost profits.\n\n42.\n\nAs to the damage caused, it is useful to recall the definition of this concept made in the *Lusitania* case:\n\n\"The fundamental concept of \u2018damage\u2019 is [...] reparation for a loss suffered; a judicially ascertained compensation for wrong. The remedy should be commensurate with the loss, so that the injured party may be made whole.\"15\n\n*See Opinion in the Lusitania Cases,* UNRIAA, vol. VII, p. 39 (emphasis in original). Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with Commentaries, United Nations (2005) *(ILC Commentary),* Article 36(3), p. 245.\n\n43.\n\nAfter considering this definition and again the dictum of the *Factory at Chorzow* case,16 the *ILC Commentary* concludes that the function of compensation is *\"to address the*  *actual losses incurred as a result* *of the internationally wrongful act\"17*\n\n*Factory at Chorzow,* p. 47.\n\n*ILC Commentary* Article 36(4) p. 245. (Emphasis added).\n\n44.\n\nFollowing this approach and to establish compensation for discriminatory treatment, the tribunal in *Feldman v. Mexico* noted that\n\n\"[...] in case of discrimination [...] what is owed by the responding Party is the amount of loss or damage that is adequately connected to the breach [...] if loss or damage is the requirement for the submission of a claim, it arguably follows that the Tribunal may direct compensation in the amount of the loss or damage actually incurred.\"18\n\n*Feldman,* \u00b6194. (Emphasis added). *See also* SD Myers, \u00b6\u00b6100, 1074; and *Petrobart Limited v. Kyrgyz Republic,* Arb. No. 126/2003, Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, (Energy Charter Treaty), pp. 77-78 (29 March 2005).\n\n45.\n\nAccordingly, the issue that the Tribunal has to address is that of the identification of the *\"actual loss\"* suffered by the investor *\"as a result\"* of Argentina\u2019s conduct. The question is one of *\"causation\"-,* what did the investor lose by reason of the unlawful acts?\n\n46.\n\nThe starting point of this analysis is to recall what the unlawful acts were. In its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal identified the abrogation of the specific guarantees provided by Argentina in the gas regulatory framework as the fundamental act giving rise to the breach of the Treaty obligations. In particular, the Tribunal considered that (i) the abolition of the right to calculate tariffs in dollars before conversion to pesos; (ii) the abandonment of the PPI adjustments;\u00a0(iii) the suspension of the tariff reviews; and (iv) the forced renegotiation of the licenses violated the standard of the fair and equitable treatment and the umbrella clause and resulted in discriminatory treatment against the gas distribution companies.\n\n47.\n\nWhat was the loss suffered by LG&E as a result of these measures? The Claimants argue that they resulted in the \"destruction\" of their investment, with a reduction in value of 93% between August 2000 and October 2002. As noted above, the Tribunal found that the value of LG&E\u2019s investment has \"rebounded\" since the economic crisis and that the effect of the measures has not been permanent on the value of the Claimants\u2019 shares. In fact, the loss of the capital value has not crystallized. Had LG&E sold its investment, as did other foreign investors, for a depressed value resulting from the measures, capital value would become a practicable basis for determining compensation. The Tribunal believes that the claim for the loss in capital value is, as noted by Respondent, premature and therefore rejects it as basis for compensation.19\n\nSimilarly, in *Feldman,* the tribunal discards the claim for capital value, stating that *\"CEMSA\u2019s \u2018going concern value \u2019 is to be dismissed because this item requires a finding of expropriation, which is not the present case\u2019'. See* *Feldman,* \u00b6198.\n\n48.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the measures - in particular, the abolition of calculation of tariffs in dollars before conversion into pesos, and the abolition of the PPI and five-year adjustments - have resulted in a significant decrease in the Licensees\u2019 revenues that, in turn, has produced a decrease of dividends distributed to shareholders. Had the basic guarantees of the gas regulatory framework been maintained, the level of dividends received by the Claimants would have been higher. In that manner, the Tribunal determines that the actual damage inflicted by the measures is the amount of dividends that could have been received *but for* the adoption of the measures.\n\n49.\n\nThe Tribunal considers damages to begin with the adoption of the first of these measures, being the injunction to suspend the PPI adjustments on 18 August 2000. Damages have continued throughout the period in which Argentina\u2019s conduct remained not in conformity with the Treaty. Whether Argentina has restored the tariff regime or has provided for an alternative solution that would put an end to the wrongful act, remains to be established on the basis of the evidence submitted. As will be explained below, the Tribunal has found that, as of 28 February 2005, Argentina\u2019s breach had continued.\n\n50.\n\nArgentina argues that the loss in value of Claimants\u2019 investments was due to the economic collapse that affected all assets in the country and not to the alleged breaches of the tariff regime. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it appears evident that the value of assets such as those owned by LG&E would have been negatively impacted by the economic situation. However, the Tribunal considers that the loss incurred by Claimants is the dividends they could have earned had the tariff regime not been abrogated. Respondent\u2019s conduct is the proximate cause of this loss.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimants raise the claim for loss of profits, in response to the method proposed by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 6. This claim will be addressed in the context of the analysis of the Tribunal\u2019s method. However, as a matter of principle, it is necessary to outline at this point the distinction between accrued losses and lost future profits. Whereas the former have commonly been awarded by tribunals, the latter have only been awarded when *\"an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be considered legally protected interests of sufficient certainty to be compensable\"20* Or, in the words of the Draft Articles, *\"in so far as it is established\".* The question is one of \" *certainty\".* *\"Tribunals have been reluctant to provide compensation for claims with inherently speculative elements.\"21*\n\n*ILC Commentary Article 36(27) pp. 259-260*\n\n*ILC Commentary Article 36(27) pp. 259-260*.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal makes a final remark with respect to the allegations on the impact of the country risk premium on compensation. Although this premium was included in the calculation of tariffs, it does not excuse Argentina for the abrogation of the tariff regime. The tariff regime was an essential feature for enticing foreign investors to invest in the gas industry and an express commitment of the Argentine Government. The tariff regime offered additional conditions than those covered by the country risk premium. In addition, acknowledging Respondent\u2019s arguments, as noted by the Claimants, would result in the absurd situation that high-risk borrowers would be excused from their international responsibility.\n\n53.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Tribunal has decided to adopt a method of calculation that accounts for the principles stated by the Tribunal and at the same time assures that the Claimants are \"fully\" compensated for the damage incurred as a result of Argentina\u2019s wrongful acts. This method is described and discussed at Section II.B below.\n\n(c) *Interest*\n--------------\n\n54.\n\nClaimants seek compound interest from 18 August 2000 through the date of the Award at a rate equal to the one-month interest rate earned on U.S. Treasury bills. Respondent rejects this claim for interest and argues that, were the Tribunal to award it, simple interest should be applied. Respondent also defends that interest be calculated from August 2000. In its view, during 2000 and 2001, LG&E received dividends and awarding interest would result in double recovery.\n\n55.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, interest is part of the \"full\" reparation to which the Claimants are entitled to assure that they are made whole. In fact, interest recognizes the fact that, between the date of the illegal act and the date of actual payment, the injured party cannot use or invest the amounts of money due. It is therefore decisive to identify the available investment alternatives to the investor in order to establish \"full\" reparation.22\n\n*See Marboe, op. cit., supra* at 10, p. 754.\n\n56.\n\nIt has been acknowledged that in \"modern economic conditions\", funds would be invested to earn compound interest. For instance, the tribunal in *Azurix* notes that *\"[...] compound interest reflects the reality of financial transactions, and best approximates the value lost by an investor\"23* Likewise, the tribunal in *MTD* v. *Chile* considers that *\"compound interest is more in accordance with the reality of financial transactions and a closer approximation to the actual value lost by an investor.24*\n\n*See Azurix,* \u00b6440.\n\n*See MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile SA.* v. *Republic of Chile* (\"MTD\"), (Caso CIADI No. ARB/01/7), Award of May 25, 2004, \u00b6 251.\n\n57.\n\nBased on these considerations, the Tribunal will decide in the section on quantification and after assessing the parties\u2019 position on the Tribunal\u2019s method, the type of interest due, the applicable rate and the period covered.\n\n**(3) Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions**\n------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments and their expert reports, the extensive evidence submitted and the particular circumstances of this case, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants are entitled to \"full\" reparation in the form of compensation that wipes out the consequences of Argentina\u2019s breach of the Treaty protections. Compensation is to be measured by the actual loss incurred by the Claimants as a result of Argentina\u2019s wrongful acts. This loss corresponds to the amount of dividends that Claimants would have received *but for* Argentina\u2019s breaches. The method to quantify compensation should account for the principles stated by the Tribunal and at the same time assures that the Claimants are \"fully\" compensated for the damage incurred as a result of Argentina\u2019s breaches. Finally, interest that best identifies the investment alternatives for the Claimants will be added until the date of payment in full.\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s Method for the Quantification of Compensation**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 6**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the loss incurred by Claimants is the amount of dividends that they would have earned *but for* the abrogation of the basic guarantees, the methods for quantifying the loss initially discussed by the parties in their submissions are inadequate. Neither the stock market price of shares nor the DCF would properly account for the accrued loss as noted in Procedural Order No. 6. Consequently, the Tribunal has decided to adopt the method described in that Procedural Order and summarized as follows:\n\n\"A calculation will be made of the dividends that would or could have been generated without any change in the tariff system. Dividends received by the Claimants will be subtracted from this figure, after which the damages suffered during the State of Necessity will be subtracted from this amount.\"\n\n60.\n\nThe method is based on the premise that, had Argentina maintained the tariff regime, the dividends received by Claimants between 18 August 2000 and 28 February 2005 would have been in effect greater than those actually paid out. As a result, the \"but for\" dividend calculation includes the restoration of the basic guarantees of the tariff regime, i.e. the elimination of the measures that the Tribunal found to have caused the loss, at \u00b646 above. The purpose is to put the Claimants into the position they would have been in had the measures not been adopted.\n\n61.\n\nThe calculation takes into account the following assumptions:\n\n\u2022 The maintenance of the tariff regime which included the PPI adjustment, the five-year adjustments and the calculation of the tariff in dollars before its conversion into pesos *(pesification).*\n\n\u2022 The point of departure for the analysis of each company is the annual average dividend during the period preceding the State of Necessity.25\n\n\u2022 Payment of annual dividends is made every six months maintaining the previous company practice.\n\n\u2022 Effective PPI adjustments in January and July of each year are based on the U.S. *Bureau of Statistics.*\n\n\u2022 The five-year review that may have been made during the second half of 2002 would have repeated factor \"X\" of the adjustment made in 1997 for each company.\n\n\u2022 Dividends would have been affected by fluctuations in the peso in relation to the dollar.\n\n\u2022 Dividends actually paid by the companies are considered on the dates and in the amounts established in the public records and in the financial bylaws.\n\n\u2022 The percentage of LG&E\u2019s shares in gas companies has remained constant.\n\n\u2022 Each company continued to apply the same dividend policy as before August 2000.\n\n\u2022 Losses incurred during the State of Necessity (1 December 2001 -26 April 2003) are to be subtracted.\n\nThe pertinence of focussing on past performance was noted by the Governing Council of the United Nations Compensation Commission when analyzing claims for loss relating to income-producing properties for a given time period (arising from the 1990/91 invasion and occupation of Kuwait by Iraq). The Governing Council noted:  \n\"In principle, the economic value of a business may include loss of future earnings and profits where they can be ascertained with reasonable certainty. In the case of the loss of businesses and their earning capacity resulting from the invasion and occupation of Kuwait, it can be expected that a number of such businesses can be or could have been rebuilt and resumed. The method of a valuation should therefore be one that focuses on past performance rather than on forecasts and projections into the future. Compensation should be provided if the loss can be ascertained with reasonable certainty based on prior earnings or profits. For example, the loss of any earnings or profits during the relevant time period could be calculated by a multiple of past earnings and profits corresponding to that time period.\"  \nUnited Nations Compensation Commission, Governing Council decision 9. *Proposition and Conclusions on Compensation for Business Losses: Types of Damages and Their* Valuation. S/AC/.26/1992/9 (March 1992). The United Nations Compensation Commission is a subsidiary organ of the United Nations Security Council. It was established by the Security Council in 1991 to process claims and pay compensation for losses resulting from Iraq\u2019s invasion and occupation of Kuwait.\n\n62.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6 finally noted that interest will be due on the amount of loss dividends up until the date of payment in full.\n\n**(2) Parties\u2019 Position on the Tribunal\u2019s Method**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nClaimants\u2019 comments on the Tribunal\u2019s method set forth in Procedural Order No. 6 were submitted on 4 December 2006, together with the comments from their experts and the witness statement of Mr. Enrique Jorge Flaiban, LG&E\u2019s Country Manager - Argentine Business.\n\n64.\n\nAlthough Claimants acknowledge that the Tribunal\u2019s method eliminates many uncertainties, they argue that it is unfair to them since it results in damages that are far lower than damages calculated according to other techniques used in such circumstances. However, they consider that a prompt award of damages using an adjusted version of the Tribunal\u2019s method would be preferable to further delays that would result from \"perpetuated debates over how to calculate damages.\" (\u00b62).26 Accordingly, Claimants (i) set out their disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s method; (ii) elaborate on its shortcomings; and (iii) propose a revised method and calculation of damages relying upon it.\n\nReferences to paragraphs or pages in this section correspond to the parties\u2019 respective comments to the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s method lies on their perception that the \"damages-in-arrears\" approach is unwarranted and improper. Firstly, the Claimants believe the approach to be inconsistent with their right to full compensation under international law (\u00b628). In the Claimants\u2019 view, the breach of Argentina\u2019s obligations has continued well after the Tribunal\u2019s cut-off date for damages (28 February 2005) and there is no indication that Argentina is willing to restore the tariff regime (129). The Award should therefore include damages for the continuing injury expected to occur (i.e. lost future profits), as long as such damages can be calculated on the basis of reasonable criteria. The Claimants\u2019 propose a revised method that would seek to include a calculation of projected lost dividends and permits the inclusion of these damages with a \"reasonable degree of certainty\" (\u00b633).\n\n66.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants allege that the approach is unfair and burdensome because it would force them to seek periodic additional relief at great cost and expense. This would place on them the whole burden of the risk and uncertainty resulting from Argentina\u2019s conduct and would reward it for persisting in its illegal conduct (\u00b628). Further, it would perpetuate the investment dispute and, therefore, maintain the adversary relationship between the Claimants and the Licensees, on the one hand, and the Argentine Government, on the other (\u00b638).\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the chief shortcoming of the Tribunal\u2019s method is its failure to give fair and consistent consideration to the past and future growth of the business. In fact, the methodology assumes no inherent business growth in the dividends that the Claimants would receive in the absence of breach and subtracts the actual dividends being received by the companies to calculate the lost dividends. Yet the subtracted actual dividends reflect the growth of the Licensees\u2019 business. This inconsistency depresses the calculation of lost dividends with every passing year (\u00b625).\n\n68.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants argue that the damage-in-arrears approach creates a \"time lag\" in the recovery of damages resulting from the interaction of the Tribunal\u2019s cut-off date of February 28, 2005 and the assumption that dividends would be paid following previous company practice i.e., dividends are paid and declared after termination of the year in which they were generated. In that manner, the methodology would prevent the Claimants from receiving, as of 28 February 2005, dividends that should have earned during the course of 2004 because the hypothetical dividends for that calendar year would not have been formally declared and paid until April 2005. The impact of this methodological feature could be substantial for the calculation of damages (\u00b6\u00b63, 9).\n\n69.\n\nConsequently, the Claimants propose that a fair solution would be to apply the proposed method including a calculation that takes account of projected lost dividends. In addition, the Tribunal should invite the Respondent to give formal assurances that it will fully restore the basic guarantees of the gas regulatory framework by a date certain. The Claimants would be able to accurately calculate their loss based upon the Respondent\u2019s reaction. The Claimants\u2019 proposal will be described in more detail in Section II.B.(3)(a) below.\n\n70.\n\nThe values resulting from the calculations performed in accordance with Claimants\u2019 proposal and accounting for the correction of the \"time lag\" are as follows: (i) damages through 28 February 2005: US$40.7 million; (ii) damages from March 2005 to December 2006: US$29.8 million; (iii) additional damages from 1 December to 31 December 2007 (should Argentina not restore tariff regime guarantees): US$20.7 million; and (iv) damages measuring the currently impaired value of the investment (from 1 January 2008 until the end of the term of the Licenses in 2027): US$174 million.\n\n71.\n\nAlthough Claimants\u2019 calculations incorporate pre-judgement interest at a yield available on one-month United States treasury bills, the Claimants\u2019 experts suggest that interest should be calculated at a rate equal to Argentina\u2019s borrowing rate, that is, substantially higher, to prevent Argentina from benefiting financially from the difference in rates by delaying payment of damages.\n\n72.\n\nFinally, the Claimants allege that, should the Tribunal decide to defer consideration of damages to future periods, it should afford the parties notice of its intention to allow them to comment on the form of the Award (\u00b654).\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its comments as to the Tribunal\u2019s method on 1 December 2006. It did not present any expert opinion or witness statement. These comments refer to (i) the average historical and paid dividends; (ii) the PPI; and (iii) the interest rate.\n\n74.\n\nFirstly, the Respondent notes that, according to the Licensees\u2019 financial statements, the average annual dividends for the 1993-2001 period were lower than those used in Procedural Order No. 6 (page 1). In addition, average annual dividends between 18 August 2000 and 28 February 2005 for GasBan and Centro were underestimated, and those for Cuyana were overestimated (page 2). The Respondent provides revised calculations for these amounts.\n\n75.\n\nSecondly, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal\u2019s method should consider the agreements of January and July 2000, signed by the Licensees, to temporarily suspend the PPI adjustment. To be consistent with regulation, the January and July adjustments envisaged in Procedural Order No. 6 should be calculated on the basis of the PPI values of April and October.\n\n76.\n\nFinally, the Respondent proposes the adoption of a pre-judgement interest rate based on short-term U.S. Treasury bills.\n\n**(3) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimants raise a number of concerns relating to (a) the principles underlying the Tribunal\u2019s method, and (b) certain methodological shortcomings. These concerns will be considered in detail below. The Tribunal will also consider the parties\u2019 comments on interest (c).\n\n78.\n\nAs to the comments made by Argentina, the Tribunal has checked the figures for average historical and paid dividends; considered the dates for the PPI values; decided that the contention to the starting date for the calculation of damages was inadmissible in view of the actual date in which the dismantling of the tariff regime began; and noted the Respondent\u2019s acceptance of the interest rate initially proposed by Claimants.\n\n(a) *The Principles Underlying the Tribunal\u2019s Method*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nFor the Claimants, the method proposed does not provide \"full\" compensation because it disregards the continuous breach of Argentina\u2019s obligations and does not account for the damages resulting from this continuous breach. It also imposes upon the Claimants the risk and uncertainty created by Argentina\u2019s conduct and the burden to seek periodic additional relief at great cost and expense.\n\n80.\n\nAccordingly, LG&E argues that a fair solution would be to apply the Tribunal\u2019s method while incorporating a calculation that includes projected lost dividends and proposes:\n\n81.\n\nFirstly, that the Tribunal *\"invite\"* the Respondent to give formal assurances that it will fully restore the basic guarantees of the gas regulatory framework by a given date.\n\n82.\n\nSecondly, if Respondent gives such assurances, the Tribunal should enter a final award comprising (i) *historical lost dividends,* from 18 August 2000 through 30 November 2006, with the exception of lost dividends attributable to the State of Necessity period; (ii) *projected lost dividends,* from 1 December 2006 up until the date at which the Respondent has committed to restore the basic guarantees in accordance with *per diem* calculations; and (iii) an *order* directing Respondent to comply with that commitment \u00b6\u00b642-44; 54).\n\n83.\n\nThirdly, if the Respondent declines to make formal commitments to restore the basic guarantees, the Tribunal should enter a final award comprising: (i) *historical lost dividends,* from 18 August 2000 through 30 November 2006 with the exception of lost dividends attributable to the State of Necessity period; (ii) *damages* from 2006 up until the date of the Award using *per diem* calculations; and (iii) the *present value of lost dividends* up until the final date of the respective Licenses. Lost dividends would be calculated using the Tribunal\u2019s method corrected to overcome its shortcomings \u00b6\u00b642-44; 54).\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with the Claimants\u2019 proposition. Firstly, the Tribunal notes that what Claimants finally label as an *\"invitation\"* is in fact a requirement that the Tribunal *\"direct\"* that *\"by 15 March 2007, the Respondent may formally commit itself to restoring the full tariff regime on or before 31 December 2007\"* ( \u00b6\u00b66 **,** 11). Such restoration would actually result in the re-establishment of the situation that existed prior to the wrongful act.27 This is the effect of restitution.\n\n*ILC Commentary,* Article 35(1), p. 237.\n\n85.\n\nFurthermore, the Tribunal notes that it agrees with Claimants that the abrogation of the basic guarantees of the gas tariff regime constitutes a continuous breach that extends to the entire period during which such abrogation continues and remains not in conformity with the Treaty (except during the State of Necessity period that justifies such breach).28 During this period and provided that the obligation is still in force, the State is under a duty to perform the obligation breached.29 It is also obliged to cease the wrongful act.30 Ceasing the wrongful act would imply restoration of the basic guarantees of the tariff regime. The result of cessation in this case would be indistinguishable from restitution.31\n\nThe *ILC Commentary* notes that examples of continuing wrongful act include \u2018the maintenance in effect of legislative provisions incompatible with treaty obligations of the enacting State\u2019. *ILC Commentary,* Article 14(3), p. 139.\n\nArticle 29 of the DARS\n\nArticle 30 of the DARS.\n\nThis eventuality was noted by the *ILC Commentary* at Article 30(7), p. 218.\n\n86.\n\nIf approached as cessation, the Claimants\u2019 request is in no way different from a demand for the reiteration of Argentina\u2019s obligations under international law. The Tribunal clearly states in its Decision on Liability that upon termination of the State of Necessity period, Argentina\u2019s obligations were once again effective; it should therefore have re-established the tariff scheme offered to LG&E or compensated the Claimants for the loss incurred.32 As Argentina has chosen not to restore its tariff obligations, the Tribunal sees no point in repeating its order and would consequently order and quantify the payment of compensation.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6265.\n\n87.\n\nLikewise, if approached as restitution, the Tribunal cannot go beyond its fiat in the Decision on Liability. The judicial restitution required in this case would imply modification of the current legal situation by annulling or enacting legislative and administrative measures that make over the effect of the legislation in breach. The Tribunal cannot compel Argentina to do so without a sentiment of undue interference with its sovereignty. Consequently, the Tribunal arrives at the same conclusion: the need to order and quantify compensation.\n\n88.\n\nSecondly, the Tribunal has noted that it agrees with the Claimants\u2019 observation as to the continuing nature of Argentina\u2019s breach. However, it can only award compensation for loss that is certain. The Tribunal is not convinced of the certainty of the lost future dividends and therefore rejects this claim.\n\n89.\n\nAs noted before, lost future profits have only been awarded when *\"an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be considered legally protected interests of sufficient certainty to be compensable* \"33 Prospective gains which are highly conjectural, \"too remote or speculative\" are disallowed by arbitral tribunals.34\n\n*ILC Commentary,* Article 36(27), pp. 259-260.\n\nJim\u00e9nez de Arechaga, E, *International Responsibility,* in M. Sorensen (ed.), *Manual of Public International Law* p. 570 (1968).\n\n90.\n\nIn this case, the Tribunal judges that future loss to the Claimants is uncertain and any attempt to calculate it is speculative. The uncertainty concerning lost future profits in the form of lost dividends results from the fact, noted above, that Claimants have retained title to their investments and are therefore entitled to any profit that the investment generates and could generate in the future. Any attempt to calculate the amount of the lost dividends in both the actual and \"but for\" scenarios is a highly speculative exercise. If the Tribunal were to compensate LG&E for lost future dividends while it continues to receive dividends distributed by the Licensees at a hypothetical low amount, a situation of double recovery would arise, unduly enriching the Claimants.\n\n91.\n\nTo support its claim for lost future profits, the Claimants invoke a number of cases in which such profits have been awarded by tribunals.35 However, these cases differ from LG&E\u2019s on one essential point: in each case the investors had lost title to their property or the relevant contracts or licenses had been put to an end. In such circumstances, it is certain that the claimants would have lost the opportunity to earn any future profit.36\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 comments to Procedural Order No. 6, dated 4 December 2006, at \u00b620.\n\nIn *Amco II,* the claimants\u2019 hotel is seized and the investment license cancelled *(*Amco Asia Corporation v. The Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Award in Resubmitted Case (5 June 1990) 89 I.L.R 580 (1992)*); in *LETCO* the government deprives claimant of its concession *(Liberian Eastern Timber Corporation (LETCO) v. Republic of Liberia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/83/2, Award (31 March 1986); in *Sapphire* the allegation is for termination of a contract as a result of breaches by the defendant *(Sapphire International v. NIOC,* Award (15 March 1963), 35 *International Law Reports* p. 136) (1967); in *Lena Goldfields,* the Soviet government puts the claimant\u2019s concession to an end and takes over the plants and secret technical processes *(Lena Goldfields Company Ltd. v. Soviet Union,* 36 Cornell L.Q. 42 (1951-1952); in *Shufeldt* the concession agreement for chicle-extraction is terminated by the *Guatemalan government (United States of America (on behalf of P.W. Shufeldt) v. Republic of Guatemala,* 24 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. 799 (24 July 1930). With respect to *Robert May,* although it referred to the termination of a contract to manage an operate a railroad, the *ILC Commentary* notes that in that case lost profits were not awarded beyond the date of adjudication. *See, ILC Commentary,* Article 36(31) footnote 608. Finally, the tribunal in *SD Myers* does not award lost future profits, but rather, the net income streams lost, the abridgment of the time available to the claimant and the value of income delayed as a result of the Canadian closure. \" [Canada] *is not responsible for more. \" SD Myers,* at \u00b6228.\n\n92.\n\nThirdly, as to the date for calculating accrued losses, Claimants contend that the cut-off date should be December 2006, the date of submission of their comments on Procedural Order No. 6. According to Claimants, there is *\"no justification\"* for using 28 February 2005 as the cut-off date once evidence is produced that *\"the breach has continued and is continuing\".* Claimants claim to have produced this evidence by submitting the witness statement of Mr. Enrique Flaiban who testified on the status of the Licensees\u2019 tariff levels.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Claimants that, if evidence is produced, damages should be awarded. However, Claimants forget that, for evidence to be considered by this Tribunal, Argentina must be given the opportunity to react to such evidence. The Respondent did not have this opportunity with regard to Mr. Flaiban\u2019s witness statement.\n\n94.\n\nThe Tribunal decided during the Hearing that no further submissions or evidence would be presented after 28 February 20 05,37 the date of the PHB in which conclusive remarks concerning each parties\u2019 case were to be exposed. The Claimants themselves opposed the introduction of new evidence by Argentina after this date.38\n\n*See* Hearing in the merits, January 29, 2005, Hearing Transcripts, vol. 7, at 1616-24.\n\nArgentina attempted on three occasions to introduce evidence regarding the alleged progress in the renegotiation process (Letters of 2 September 2005, 12 January 2006 and 11 April 2006). The Claimants opposed to the Tribunal\u2019s acceptance of such evidence (Letters of 14 September 2005, 24 January 2006 and 27 April 2006). The Tribunal, based in its previous decision that no further submissions be filed, rejected the introduction of the evidence (Letters of 5 October 2005, 30 January 2006 and 9 May 2007).\n\n95.\n\nRespect for due process obliges this Tribunal to only consider evidence that the other side has been able to test. On the basis of this evidence, the Tribunal assesses Argentina\u2019s continuous breach of its obligations between 18 August 2000 and 28 February 2005. Any event occurring after 28 February 2005 that could be seen to remedy the Respondent\u2019s breaches and affect the calculation of damages (like the progress on the renegotiation process) is not considered in the present procedure, as indicated in Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n96.\n\nFourthly, Claimants\u2019 arguments that they would have to bear the risk and uncertainty resulting from Argentina\u2019s conduct and the burden to seek periodic additional relief at great cost and expense are not entirely without merit. However, the Claimants have chosen to maintain their investments in Argentina regardless of its reluctance to re-establish the gas regulatory framework following the end of the State of Necessity period. The decision to maintain their investments in Argentina has its consequences: (i) the impact of Argentina\u2019s conduct on the value of investments has not crystallized and is subject to the changing regulatory environment and fluctuations of the stock market; (ii) lost future profits are uncertain and their calculation is speculative; and (iii) compensation could only be awarded for damages actually suffered and sufficiently proven.\n\n97.\n\nThis is in no way a reward to Argentina for its continued wrongdoing. This Tribunal has established that the abrogation of the basic guarantees of the gas tariff regime has breached Argentina\u2019s obligations under the Treaty. This breach makes Argentina liable for the payment of compensation as long as Argentina fails to restore such regime after 28 February 2005. The recognition of this responsibility is, on the contrary, an incentive to Argentina to restore the tariff regime or a least to engage in genuine arms-length negotiations to avoid future condemnatory decisions.\n\n98.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal does not agree with Claimants that it has to request the parties\u2019 views as to the form of this Award. The parties have had the opportunity to comment on the Tribunal\u2019s method, including the eventuality of future proceedings.\n\n(b) *The Alleged Methodological Shortcomings*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nClaimants make two contentions in this respect: (i) that the Tribunal\u2019s method does not allow consistent consideration of the business growth; and (ii) the existence of a rolling \"time lag\" in the recovery of damages resulting from the difference in time between declaration and payment of dividends.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that Claimants\u2019 arguments as to the impact of business growth on the dividends that would have been generated by the distribution companies between 2000 and 2005 but for abrogation of the basic guarantees of the gas tariff regime, are reasonable. In fact, the underlying growth (other than PPI and X-factor adjustments) would lead to increased dividend payouts. Consequently, damages have been calculated to account for this fact. The calculation considers available information as to the levels of business activity of the distribution companies during the relevant period. It takes the appropriate measure of actual growth to be the average annual growth rate of gas volumes.\n\n101.\n\nThe contention as to the \"time lag\" is similar to the choice of accounting frameworks, between cash accounting or accruals accounting. Cash accounting recognizes revenue and expenditure transactions only on the date that cash or bank movements take place whereas, by contrast, accruals accounting recognizes the benefit or liability incurred based on the timing of the underlying event. Accruals accounting is more widely used than cash accounting since it reflects more fully and accurately the financial position of an entity. Accordingly, the Tribunal has included in its calculations those dividends paid and payable in April 2005 but, on the same basis, has excluded any dividends found to have been paid to shareholders during the early months of the loss period.\n\n(c) *Interest*\n--------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal disallows the Claimants\u2019 expert proposal to use Argentina\u2019s borrowing rate as speculative and extemporaneous. The Tribunal notes further that Argentina has supported the use of a pre-judgement interest rate based on short-term U.S. Treasury bills. This is therefore the rate of interest to be applied.\n\n103.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal is of the opinion that compound interest would better compensate the Claimants for the actual damages suffered since it better reflects contemporary financial practice.\n\n104.\n\nAs far as the period is concerned, interest should be paid from the period 18 August 2000 until the date of this Award. The Tribunal disagrees with Argentina that payment of interest from 2000 would result in double recovery. Interest is due on the amount of dividends that Claimants would have received but for abrogation of the tariff regime minus the dividends actually received and is distinct from the dividends actually received. Lost dividends compensate Claimants for Argentina\u2019s breach and interest compensates Claimants for the impossibility to invest the amounts due.\n\n105.\n\nFinally, in case the amount awarded is not paid in full by 30 days after the dispatch of this Award, the Respondent shall pay compound interest at a rate of six-month U.S. Treasury bills until the date of payment in full of this Award.\n\n**(4) Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions**\n------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s method to quantify compensation calculates the dividends that Claimants would have received *but for* Argentina\u2019s breaches and subtracts from such dividends those that were actually received by Claimants. Losses during the State of Necessity period are subsequently subtracted. The method was adjusted to account for the Claimants\u2019 comments on the methodological shortcomings and the verification of the dividend figures and the PPI data. Compound interest at the rate of six-month U.S. Treasury bills will be added.\n\n**C. Quantification of Compensation**\n-------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nBased on the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal has used the following figures for the quantification of compensation:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | Cuyana | Centro | GasBan |\n| Total PPI adjustments (a) | **$ 1.5m** | **$ 1.4m** | **$ 3.2m** |\n| Total 5-year adjustment (b) | **$ -0.6m** | **$-0.6m** | **$ -1.2m** |\n| \u2018But for\u2019 dividends Aug. 2000- Feb. 2005 *[including* a and b above] | **$ 117.6m** | **$ 112.3m** | **$ 247.0m** |\n| Actual dividends paid Aug. 2000-Feb 2005 | **$ 41.9m** | **$ 38.1 m** | **$ 69.6 m** |\n| Average annual growth rate of gas volumes [2000-2005] | **4.21%** | **3.32%** | **4.22%** |\n| LG&E shareholding | **14.4%** | **45.9%** | **19.6%** |\n\n108.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal establishes that the actual loss incurred by Claimants is quantified as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Cuyana (million US$)** | **Centro (million US$)** | **GasBan (million US$)** | **Total (million US$)** |\n| **LG&E** **dividends loss** | 10.9 | 34.0 | 34.8 | 79.7 |\n| **Minus; Loss suffered during the period of emergency** | -4.3 | -12.6 | -11.9 | -28.8 |\n| **Subtotal** | 6.6 | 21.4 | 22.9 | 50.9 |\n| **Interest39** | **+0.9** | **+2.7** | **+2.9** | +6.5 |\n| ****Total**** | **7.5** | **24.1** | **25.8** | **57.4** |\n\nCalculated up to 11 July 2007.\n\n109.\n\nIn the light of all of the above, the Tribunal awards Claimants US$57.4 million as compensation for the damages suffered as a result of Respondent\u2019s continuing breach of its Treaty obligations between 18 August 2000 and 28 February 2005, including interest up until the date of the Award.\n\n**III. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. The Principles Concerning the Allocation of Costs**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Parties\u2019 Positions**\n--------------------------\n\n110.\n\nLG&E requests that the Tribunal award it all costs and expenses for the arbitration, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees in consideration of Respondent\u2019s breaches of its obligations under the Treaty and its denial to accept responsibility (Claimants\u2019 Memorial, \u00b6207).\n\n111.\n\nThe sole reference to costs made by the Respondent is found in the Rejoinder of its Request for Relief, in which it asks the Tribunal for the \" *costas\"* meaning *the costs* of the proceedings.40\n\nIn fact, Article 77 of the Argentine Procedural Code provides that \"La *condena en costas comprender\u00e1 todos los gastos causados u ocasionados por la sustanciaci\u00f3n del proceso [...].\"*\n\n**(2) Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 28 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules grant discretion to ICSID tribunals with regard to the award of costs. The Tribunal further notes that there is no uniform practice in treaty arbitration with regard to this matter. However, recently, tribunals have made recourse to the basic principle \" *costs follow the event\"* or \" *loser-pays-rule\"* according to which the cost of the arbitration should be borne by the unsuccessful party.41 The outcome of the case becomes the most significant factor in determining the allocation of costs.\n\n*International Thunderbird Gaming v. United Mexican States,* UNCITRAL (NAFTA) Award of January 23, 2006; *Methanex v. United States of America,* UNCITRAL (NAFTA) Award of August 3, 2005; *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka v. Slovakia,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4), Award of December 14, 2004.\n\n113.\n\nIn the present case, not all Claimants\u2019 claims are successful; likewise, some of the Respondent\u2019s defences prevail. This result would call for an equitable allocation of costs. The Tribunal decides therefore that each party should bear its own costs, expenses and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\n**(3) Tribunal\u2019s Conclusion**\n-----------------------------\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that each party should bear its own costs, expenses and attorney\u2019s fees.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n115.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders its decision as follows:\n\na. Within 30 days of the date of dispatch of this Award, Argentina shall pay to LG&E, the sum of US$57,400,000.00, as well as compound interest on that amount at a rate of six-month U.S. Treasury bills until the date of payment in full of this Award."}, {"Title": "Decision on Claimants' Request for Supplementary Decision", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2008-07-08T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Claimants' Request for Supplementary Decision\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 3 October 2006, the Tribunal rendered a Decision on Liability (the \"Decision on Liability\") in which it found the Respondent to be in breach of its obligations under the Treaty.1 It retained jurisdiction to determine damages in a subsequent phase of the arbitration.\n\nCapitalized terms not defined in this Decision have the meaning provided for in the Decision on Liability and the Award.\n\n2.\n\nOn 3 November 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (the \"P.O. No. 6\") proposing a methodology for the calculation of damages. In this Order, the Tribunal stated that Claimants' claim for future damages in the form of lost profits was too uncertain and, for this reason, it ruled to \"*limit the damages to be awarded to the period between 18 August 2000 and 28 February 2005, with the exception of the period of State of Necessity, and without prejudice to Claimants' rights to claim damages from Respondent in the present or other proceedings in the event that Respondent continues to breach its obligations after 28 February 2005*.\" (Footnotes omitted)\n\n3.\n\nOn 5 December 2006, the Secretary of the Tribunal circulated the parties' comments regarding P.O. No. 6. In their comments, Claimants contested the cut-off date for the calculation of damages and submitted the witness statement of Mr. Flaiban, LG&E's Country Manager - Argentine Business, offering new evidence on the Respondent's continuous breaches of the Treaty.\n\n4.\n\nThe final decision on damages was embodied in the Award issued on 25 July 2007 (the \"Award\"). In the Award, the Tribunal, after consideration of the whole spectrum of the parties' arguments on damages, including their comments on P.O. No. 6, ordered the Respondent to pay US$57,400,000 plus interest for damages suffered by the Claimants between 18 August 2000 and 28 February 2005.\n\n**B. PROCEDURE**\n----------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 23 August 2007, Claimants submitted a Request for a Supplementary Decision (the \"Request\"), in accordance with Article 49 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Respondent filed its Observations on the Request (the \"Observations\"), on 26 October 2007.\n\n6.\n\nOn 12 November 2007, Claimants filed their Reply to the Observations (the \"Reply\") and Respondent submitted its Rejoinder to the Request (the \"Rejoinder\"), on 26 November 2007.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 29 February 2008, the Tribunal informed the parties that no further submissions were required and that no hearing would be held. The proceeding was declared closed on 7 July 2008.\n\n**C. PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n-------------------------\n\n8.\n\nClaimants note that the Tribunal chose not to consider their evidence of continuing breach and continuing damages, submitted with their comments to P.O. No. 6, on the grounds that the Respondent had not had the opportunity to respond to this evidence. Claimants allege that, in doing so, the Tribunal left unresolved the issue of post-28 February 2005 damages. Consequently, Claimants request that \"*in the interest of justice and efficiency*\" the Tribunal update the quantum of compensation owed by Respondent for damages sustained from 1 March 2005 to 31 July 2007 and avoid the delays and costs of new proceedings. For this purpose, Claimants submit a supplemental declaration by Mr. Flaiban as further evidence of the Respondent's continuous breach, alleging that the Respondent has not restored any of the guarantees of the Regulatory Framework and has not paid due compensation. Claimants further submit an approximate calculation of such compensation.\n\n9.\n\nIn its Observations, Respondent asserts that the recourse provided for in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention is designed to correct inadvertent and non-substantial omissions occurring in an Award. The Claimants' Request, therefore, exceeds the limits of a supplementary decision because: (a) it does not refer to an \"inadvertent\" omission but to a deliberate decision adopted by the Tribunal; (b) it does not attempt to amend a minor error but to address substantial issues such as the extension of the damages period and the duplication of the Award's quantum; (c) it purports to treat a question that has already been resolved, while the purpose of Article 49(2) is not to reopen proceedings; (d) it does not address the Award itself but the preliminary acts, in particular P.O. No. 6; and (e) it introduces new alleged facts and evidence for the Tribunal's consideration.\n\n10.\n\nFinally, Respondent draws attention to the controversial nature of the evidence submitted by the Claimants and brings to light other relevant facts that would need to be taken into account in the determination of additional damages, in particular, the agreement signed with the Licensee in the renegotiation process, the retroactive increase of tariffs, new legislation concerning the emergency and LG&E's disposal of its investment. It contends that granting the Request would result in the Tribunal's exceeding its powers and a violation of the Respondent's right to due process and defense since it would not be permitted to contest such evidence; recourse to a supplementary decision not being the appropriate means. Consequently, the Respondent asks for the Request to be dismissed and for costs to be covered by Claimants.\n\n11.\n\nIn their Reply, Claimants allege that, although Respondent had been given the opportunity to challenge their arguments and rebut the evidence, it had chosen to remain silent and to raise unfounded procedural objections as well as vague and speculative allegations regarding tangential facts that are irrelevant to the question of damages. In the Claimants' view, the Respondent's objections are unfounded because they mischaracterize the purpose of recourse to a supplementary decision, as set out in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, or are inapplicable to this case. Moreover, Claimants allege that, since the absence of restoration of the guarantees and the amount of dividends received by Claimants in the relevant period are uncontroversial, the Tribunal should proceed to apply the methodology adopted in the Award to supplement it with an additional calculation of compensation. Claimants note, however, that the Respondent should be given full opportunity to defend its interests.\n\n12.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent sustains its arguments concerning the nature and scope of recourse to a supplementary decision and denies the Claimants' allegation that it consented to the facts and evidence submitted by them. The Respondent underlines that submitting new facts and evidence is strange to such remedy and that, therefore, the Respondent's Observations to the Request are not the appropriate means by which to respond to them. Accordingly, Respondent reiterates its demand for the dismissal of the Request and the allocation of costs to Claimants.\n\n**D. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------\n\n13.\n\nIt is undisputed that the purpose of recourse to a supplementary decision, as set out in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, is to provide a remedy to questions that the Tribunal has omitted to decide in an award. Claimants' Request, however, does not concern a question that the Tribunal has omitted to decide in the Award.\n\n14.\n\nIn its Award, the Tribunal dealt at length with the Claimants' arguments concerning the cut-off date for calculating accrued losses. Its third consideration in determining the appropriate method for the quantification of compensation, at paragraphs 92 to 95, reads as follows:\n\n92. Thirdly, as to the date for calculating accrued losses, Claimants contend that the cut-off date should be December 2006, the date of submission of their comments on Procedural Order No. 6. According to Claimants, there is \"*no justification*\" for using 28 February 2005 as the cut-off date once evidence is produced that \"*the breach has continued and is continuing*\". Claimants claim to have produced this evidence by submitting the witness statement of Mr. Enrique Flaiban who testified on the status of the Licensees' tariff levels.\n\n93. The Tribunal agrees with Claimants that, if evidence is produced, damages should be awarded. However, Claimants forget that, for evidence to be considered by this Tribunal, Argentina must be given the opportunity to react to such evidence. The Respondent did not have this opportunity with regard to Mr. Flaiban's witness statement.\n\n94. The Tribunal decided during the Hearing that no further submissions or evidence would be presented after 28 February 2005,37 the date of the PHB in which conclusive remarks concerning each parties' case were to be exposed. The Claimants themselves opposed the introduction of new evidence by Argentina after this date.38\n\n95. Respect for due process obliges this Tribunal to only consider evidence that the other side has been able to test. On the basis of this evidence, the Tribunal assesses Argentina's continuous breach of its obligations between 18 August 2000 and 28 February 2005. Any event occurring after 28 February 2005 that could be seen to remedy the Respondent's breaches and affect the calculation of damages (like the progress on the renegotiation process) is not considered in the present procedure, as indicated in Procedural Order No. 6.\n\n*See* Hearing in the merits, January 29, 2005, Hearing Transcripts, vol. 7, at 1616-24\n\nArgentina attempted on three occasions to introduce evidence regarding the alleged progress in the renegotiation process (Letters of 2 September 2005, 12 January 2006 and 11 April 2006). The Claimants opposed to the Tribunal's acceptance of such evidence (Letters of 14 September 2005, 24 January 2006 and 27 April 2006). The Tribunal, based in its previous decision that no further submissions be filed, rejected the introduction of the evidence (Letters of 5 October 2005, 30 January 2006 and 9 May 2007).\n\n15.\n\nWith respect to due process, the Tribunal decided that it would not consider further evidence on the breach of the Respondent's obligations after 28 February 2005. It appears, therefore, that Claimants are attempting to reopen the discussion of a question that has been dealt with and disposed of by the Tribunal.\n\n16.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants misconceive the function of the recourse to a supplementary decision by asserting that it allows Argentina to respond to their new arguments and evidence. The supplementation process is not a mechanism by which parties can continue proceedings on the merits or seek a remedy that calls into question the validity of the Tribunal's decision. Referring to Professor Schreuer, the *ad hoc* Committee in the *Vivendi* case noted:\n\n[...] it is important to state that that procedure [by which ICSID awards and decisions may be supplemented and rectified], and any supplementary decision or rectification as may result, in no way consist of a means of appealing or otherwise revising the merits of the decision subject to supplementation or rectification.2\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning Annulment of the Award, \u00b611 (28 May 2003).\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of the Claimants' concern about their available means to claim post-28 February 2005 damages. It cannot, however, disregard the principle of due process nor the purpose of the supplementation process, as provided for in Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, to address this concern. Claimants are not, however, deprived of their right to claim additional damages. The possibility of starting new proceedings under the ICSID Convention still remains.\n\n18.\n\nWith regard to costs of the present proceedings concerning a supplementary decision, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal are determined at US$74,954.74, which shall be bore by the Claimants. In view of the circumstances of the case, each party shall bear its own legal and other expenses.\n\n**E. TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n--------------------------\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders the following decisions:\n\n(a) Claimants' Request is denied;\n\n(b) The fees and expenses of the Tribunal are determined at US$74,954.74, which shall be borne by the Claimants; and\n\n(c) Each party shall bear its own legal and other expenses."}]}
