Background The**\n---------------------\n\n**Request for Arbitration**\n---------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn October 10, 2006, City Oriente Limited, the Claimant in these proceedings, filed a request for arbitration with ICSID against the Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal de Petroleos del Ecuador. The parties will be hereinafter referred to as \"City Oriente,\" \"Ecuador,\" and \"Petroecuador.\"\n\n2.\n\nIn its request for arbitration, Claimant stated that, on March 29, 1995, it had entered into a Hydrocarbons Production Share Contract recorded on a notarial instrument and attested to by Notary Public No. 1 in and for the city of Quito, Dr. Jorge Machado Cevallos, by and between Claimant and the State of Ecuador, acting through Petroecuador. The Contract was signed by the then Constitutional President of Ecuador, Ing. Sixto Duran Ball\u00e9n, as an honor witness. The purpose of the Contract was the exploration and production of hydrocarbons in the so-called \"Oil Block No. 27,\" located in the Province of Sucumbios; pursuant to clause 22.2., the parties became subject to the laws of Ecuador.\n\n3.\n\nOnce executed, the Contract was performed by the parties in compliance with the terms thereof until April 25, 2006, when Law 2006-42, the Law Amending the Hydrocarbon Law, came into full force and effect. Pursuant thereto, Section 44 of the Hydrocarbon Law came to read as follows:\n\n*\"On account of hydrocarbon field exploration and production, the State shall receive no less than the following revenue: initial premiums, surface rights, royalties, compensation payments, contributions through compensation works, a share of extra revenue from oil sales prices; on account of transportation, it shall receive a share of the tariffs. \"* [Unofficial translation.]\n\n4.\n\nFurthermore, Law No. 2006-42 added an additional provision to the Hydrocarbon Law, as follows:\n\n*\"Section... State's share of unexpected or non-negotiated extra revenue from oil sales prices. Irrespective of the volume of their crude oil share, contractors holding hydrocarbon exploration and production contracts in force with the State of Ecuador subject to the provisions hereof shall, if the actual monthly average FOB sales price for Ecuadorian crude oil exceeds the monthly average sales price in force as of the date of execution of the contract -stated in constant currency as of the month of its calculation- pay to the State at least 50% of the extraordinary revenue received as a result of the difference between said prices. For the purposes of this section, extraordinary revenue shall mean the above-described price difference multiplied by the number of barrels produced. The price of oil as of the date of the contract to be used as reference to calculate such difference shall be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index of the United States of America, as published by the Central Bank of Ecuador. \"* [Unofficial translation.]\n\n5.\n\nAccording to Claimant, by means of Law No. 2006-42 Ecuador tried to unilaterally modify the Contract (thereby affecting, among others, clauses 5.3.2, 8.1 and 10), in conflict with the express provisions of said Contract and the *pacta sunt servanda* principle, as the contents of the contract may not be amended unless upon mutual consent by the parties.\n\n6.\n\nCity Oriente further argues that Petroecuador has demanded that it pay the relevant State share of the so-called extra revenue from oil sales prices under Law No. 200642, payment of such extra revenue not being provided for in the Contract. Such demand for payment apparently amounts to an attempt to unilaterally amend the Contract, in conflict with the express provisions thereof, therefore entailing a breach of the Contract.\n\n7.\n\nIn the face of such a breach, pursuant to Section 1505 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code [\"C.C\"] - the provisions of which apply where so agreed by the parties - the party *in bonis* may choose between contract performance or contract termination, with a claim for damages in either case. Claimant opted to demand performance, reserving its right to a potential claim for damages. According to City Oriente, such claim entails respondents' undertaking to refrain from instituting proceedings for an administrative declaration of Contract termination or adopting measures impairing regular Contract performance.\n\n8.\n\nThe Contract contains an ICSID arbitration clause. Specifically, clause 20.3 provides as follows:\n\n*\"...as of the date in which the Agreement on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and other States ' Nationals (the \"Agreement\"), subscribed by the Republic of Ecuador, as Member State of the International Reconstruction and Development Bank, on January fifteen (15), nineteen eight six (1,986), Official Registration number three hundred eighty six (386) on March three (3), nineteen eight six (1,986), is ratified by the Ecuadorian National Congress, the parties commit themselves to submit controversies or disagreements related to or resulting from this Contract to the jurisdiction of the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disagreements (ICSID) for their solution according to the provisions of such Agreement. \"*\n\n9.\n\nCity Oriente initiated this arbitration based on the above-transcribed arbitration agreement.\n\n**City Oriente's first request for provisional measures**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nOn October 9, 2007, Claimant filed its first request petitioning the adoption of provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention [\"Convention\".] The requested provisional measures consisted in an order that Respondents refrain from prosecuting the enforced collection of any present or future amounts disputed in this arbitration, and that they refrain from initiating a proceeding for the administrative declaration of termination of the concession on account of non-payment of said moneys pending the final arbitral award. Such request was supplemented with a further document filed the next day, on October 10.\n\n**The Tribunal's response**\n---------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal invited Ecuador and Petroecuador to submit their position in connection with the request for provisional measures by October 25, 2007. The next day, October 11, the Tribunal transmitted a new document to the parties, scheduling a hearing to be held on November 8 and 9 in Washington, D.C., to deal, among other issues, with the provisional measures and the procedural aspects of the arbitration.\n\n**City Oriente's second request**\n---------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOne day later, on October 11, Claimant filed a new submission repeating its request that the Tribunal order the provisional measures *\"immediately, since Respondent's recent attitude entails serious danger to... City Oriente\"* [unofficial translation]. Specifically, City Oriente argued that the State Attorney General had announced the filing of a criminal complaint with the Ecuadorian Prosecutor's Office against City Oriente's representatives and managers. For evidentiary purposes, City Oriente filed two media articles reporting on the fact that the Attorney General's Office would file enforcement actions and complaints with the Prosecutor's Office in connection with non-payment of the extra oil revenue.\n\n**The Tribunal's first communication to the parties**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nOn October 16, the Tribunal transmitted a communication to both parties, stating as follows:\n\n*\"... after considering and deliberating on said letters, the Tribunal has decided to request that, pending a decision by the Tribunal on the provisional measures requested by Claimant through its letter of October 9, 2007, both parties refrain from engaging in any conduct -including, without limitation, any act, resolution or decision- that may directly or indirectly affect or modify the legal situation existing as of such date between the parties under the Contract dated March 29,**1995, particularly in connection with the effectiveness or administrative termination of said Contract or the enforced collection of any moneys.*\n\n*If either party intends to take any measure that may violate the provisions set forth herein, prior notice must be served to the Tribunal, granting enough time so that the Tribunal may proceed as appropriate. \"* [Unofficial translation.]\n\n**Ecuador's first submission**\n------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn October 19, acting on behalf of Ecuador, the State Attorney General's Office filed its first submission, arguing that it was currently in the process of selecting an international law firm to defend the interests of both Respondents. Accordingly, it requested that the deadline set for Respondents to respond to the request for provisional measures be extended from October 25, 2007 to January 15, 2008, and that the hearing set for November 8 and 9 be rescheduled to January 17 and 18, 2008. In said submission, the State Attorney's Office did not object to the hearings being held in Washington, D.C.\n\n**City Oriente's third request**\n--------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn October 22, 2007, Claimant filed a new submission reporting that Respondents had failed to abide by the Tribunal's decision of October 16, as two criminal complaints had been filed against City Oriente's executives:\n\n16.\n\n(a) The first complaint had been filed by national Representative Gongora Zambrano with the Ecuadorian Prosecutor against former Minister of Energy and Mines Ing. Ivan Rodriguez Ramos and three executives of City Oriente (Messrs. Ford, Y\u00e9pez and Paez Cruz) on October 17, on charges of embezzlement allegedly perpetrated as a result of City Oriente's failure to pay the State's share of the extra revenue from hydrocarbon, as required by Law No. 2006-42; as evidence, Claimant provided a copy of the complaint, stamped by the Attorney General's Office.\n\n17.\n\n(b) The second complaint had been submitted a day later, on October 18, by the Representative of the State Attorney General with the Ecuadorian Prosecutor for the District of Pichincha, as evidenced by the Press Release of October 2007, issued by the State Attorney General's Office and published on the Office's web page, which document was also produced by Claimant. In this case, the complaint was filed only against City Oriente's executives on allegations that City Oriente had refused to make several payments provided for in Law No. 2006-42, which refusal led other contractors to take a similar position. Apparently, said company had expressly acknowledged its decision not to pay the extra revenue provided for in the aforementioned Law through its October 10, 2006 letter to the ICSID's Secretary-General in the course of these proceedings.\n\n18.\n\nNext, City Oriente argued that, one day later, on October 19, Petroecuador's Executive President sent an official letter to Claimant, accompanied by commercial invoice No. 000011, for USD 28,023,363, on account of moneys allegedly owing under Law No. 2006-42. In such official letter, Petroecuador *\"respectfully* [demands that City Oriente] *immediately settle said amounts, notwithstanding any proceedings\"* [unofficial translation].\n\n**The Tribunal's second communication to the parties**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nOn October 24, 2007, the Tribunal transmitted a second communication to the parties whereby, after acknowledging Claimant's submission of October 22, it stated as follows:\n\n*\"... The Tribunal has verified that, as per the website of Ecuador's State Attorney General's Office as online on October 18, 2007 (attached as Exhibit 3 to Claimant's letter of October 22), the State Attorney General requested the Pichincha District Prosecutor to start a preliminary investigation in order to determine whether City Oriente Limited's refusal to make payment of the amounts provided for in the Law Amending the Hydrocarbon Law entails an unlawful act. In any event, the Tribunal has verified that, by means of the letter of October 19, 2007 (attached as Exhibit 7 to Claimant's letter of October 22), Petroecuador did officially notify City Oriente Limited of the issue of Invoice No. 000011 for USD 28,023,363, on account of the application of the Law Amending the Hydrocarbon Law, demanding that it immediately settle such amount notwithstanding any pending proceeding. It is the Tribunal's view that said actions may undermine the effectiveness of the provisional relief requested by Claimant, thereby depriving Claimant of its lawful right to have its interests effectively protected. Accordingly, the Tribunal hereby orders that, pending a ruling on the provisional measures requested by City Oriente Limited, the Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador) refrain from:*\n\n*Instituting or prosecuting any judicial action of any nature against City Oriente Limited or its officers or employees arising from or in connection with the Contract of March 29, 1995, and/or enforcing the application of the Law Amending the Hydrocarbon Law to said Contract;*\n\n*Demanding that City Oriente Limited make payment of any amount as a result of the application of the Law Amending the Hydrocarbon Law to the Contract;*\n\n*Engaging in any other conduct that may directly or indirectly affect or alter the legal situation existing under the Contract of March 29, 1995, as thereby agreed upon and executed by the parties.*\n\n*This letter shall become ineffective upon the Tribunal's ruling on the provisional measures requested by Claimant. \"* [Unofficial translation.]\n\n20.\n\nThrough that same communication, the Tribunal denied Respondents' request for a deadline extension for the submission of their arguments in connection with the request for provisional measures. Given the urgent and serious nature of Claimant's factual allegations, it was the Tribunal's view that such period could not be extended.\n\n**Ecuador's second submission and Petroecuador's first submission**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn October 24, the State Attorney General's Office acknowledged the orders issued by the Tribunal that same day, *\"and will raise any objections within its purview, \"* [unofficial translation], without prejudice to the general duty to comply with and enforce the law. In any event, the State Attorney General \"*reserves its right to further elaborate on the circumstances surrounding the proceeding during the conference call \"* [unofficial translation] organized by the Tribunal to be held on October 31.\n\n22.\n\nOn October 29, Petroecuador filed its first submission in this arbitration, explaining the passing of Law No. 2006-42, laying emphasis on the fact that said Law did not in the least affect the Production contract in place with City Oriente, *\"since there is no contract clause providing for a State's share of the extra revenue from production in excess of the limit set in each contract as of the date of execution; therefore, it is evident that such issue is at the sovereign discretion of the State of Ecuador, which, in exercise of its powers, defined the general parameters for application in the national territory; this is even more evidently so as the contracts remained unchanged and in full performance by the oil companies'\"* [unofficial translation].\n\n23.\n\nLastly, Ecuador invoked its national sovereignty and argued that *\"anywhere in the world, a national or foreign citizen who commits a crime that qualifies as such and for which a sentence is defined will obviously be imposed the relevant sentence by the appropriate court, due process observed and after being afforded an opportunity to defend themselves, without this entailing an impairment of City Oriente 's rights, as it seeks to establish, misleading the members of the Tribunal\"\"* [unofficial translation.]\n\n**City Oriente's fourth and fifth submissions**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nOn October 25, City Oriente notified the Tribunal that, on that same day, it had received notices sent by the Ecuadorian Prosecutor to company executives Ford, Paez and Y\u00e9pez. They were thereby requested to appear before the Ecuadorian Prosecutor, in the company of legal counsel, \"*in order to take their not-sworn statement providing a free version of the facts in connection with the alleged embezzlement, as a result of the complaint filed by representative Luis Laxner G\u00f3ngora Zambrano\"\"* [unofficial translation] on November 1, 5 and 7, 2007.\n\n25.\n\nLastly, on October 31, Claimant filed a new submission replying to Respondents' allegations set forth in their submissions of October 24 and 29.\n\n**The conference call**\n-----------------------\n\n26.\n\nA conference call was held on October 31, 2007 between legal counsel for City Oriente, the Attorney General and attorneys from the State Attorney General's Office, acting on behalf of Ecuador, and Petroecuador's legal counsel, as well as the Tribunal and the Secretary. During said conference call the participants discussed the request for provisional measures and the development of the proceedings. Claimant requested that the hearing to discuss the provisional measures and the procedural aspects of the arbitration be held on November 8 and 9, as scheduled, given the urgent nature of its request, as further aggravated by the criminal complaints filed against the company's executives. On the other hand, Respondents requested that the hearing be pushed back to January or February 2008, claiming that they needed extra time to select and hire an international law firm to represent them.\n\n27.\n\nAlso on October 31, after hearing the parties, the Tribunal rendered a decision\n\n- Allowing Respondents' request, pushing back the procedural hearing to January 11, 2008 in order that Respondents may hire legal counsel;\n\n- Given the urgent nature of the request for provisional measures filed by Claimant, and in the light of the provisions of Rule 39 (2) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings [the \"Rules\"], maintaining the date of the hearing on provisional measures, to be held on November 9, 2007 in Washington, D.C.;\n\n- In preparation for such hearing, the Tribunal ordered that, no later than November 8, Ecuador file a written submission providing a detailed description of any actions taken that were covered by the Tribunal's decision of October 24, 2007, including, without limitation, any criminal actions filed;\n\n- Lastly, the Tribunal stated it was willing to suspend the November 9 hearing and the filing of the submission provided for in the preceding paragraph provided, however, that, before November 6, Ecuador submitted a statement undertaking to abide by the Tribunal's order of October 24, 2007 in strict compliance with the terms thereof; such obligation would remain fully effective pending the Tribunal's ruling on the requested provisional measures.\n\n28.\n\nEcuador did not file its statement of commitment by November 6. Ecuador also failed to file, by November 8, the submission providing a detailed description of any actions taken.\n\n29.\n\nMeanwhile, on November 5, ICSID's Secretary-General gave notice to the parties of the specific arrangements made in connection with the hearing to be held on November 9 at the World Bank's offices in Washington, D.C.\n\n**Respondents' submissions of November 9**\n------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nIn the evening of November 8, 2007, a letter was received from the State Attorney General's Office giving notice of \"*its decision not to appear in Washington D.C. on November 9\"* [unofficial translation]. The Attorney General's Office argued that clause 20.3.3 of the Contract expressly defines the city of Quito as the place of any arbitration proceedings.\n\n31.\n\nFurthermore, Ecuador argued that the urgency claimed by City Oriente is not such, as the State has taken no measure whatsoever against it that entails an alteration to its Block 27 operations. Moreover, a proceeding for administrative termination takes over one year. Ecuador intends to engage in a renegotiation of the contracts currently in place and, should this not be feasible, to observe and abide by existing contracts subject to the applicable laws and regulations. The fact that Petroecuador sent an invoice is not an extraordinary occurrence but, rather, a new instance of repeated conduct and, as such, it does not create urgency. As regards the criminal proceeding instituted on the initiative of Mr. Gongora, such filing cannot be deemed an act of the State, as the complaint was filed by him in his personal capacity. Lastly, Ecuador suggests that the Tribunal has overstepped its powers under the Convention and the Rules, as it cannot pass provisional measures as interim measures adopted prior to final measures, as no such measures exist. Neither may the Tribunal order provisional measures without previously affording the parties the opportunity to raise observations.\n\n32.\n\nA document from Petroecuador was also received on November 9, 2007, whereby Petroecuador insisted on its request for a rescheduling of the hearing on provisional measures to February 2008, allowing that entity the time allegedly required to select and hire a law firm. However, it noted that it objected to Claimant's request, as the provisional measures were allegedly only intended to avoid payment of its obligations to the State of Ecuador. As evidence, it provided an *Aide-M\u00e9moire* delivered by City Oriente on October 29, whereby, according to Petroecuador, City Oriente allegedly acknowledged its debt outstanding to the State under Law No. 2006-42. Lastly, Respondent argued that the urgent nature of City Oriente's request to the Tribunal is unfounded and at odds with the actual facts. The Tribunal's excessive diligence in dealing with one of the parties allegedly pushed Petroecuador into a position *\"of complete defenselessness\"* [unofficial translation].\n\n**The November 9, 2007 hearing**\n--------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nAt 9:00 a.m. on November 9, 2007, Claimant's legal counsel, as well as the members of the Tribunal and the Secretary's Office, appeared at the Washington offices of the World Bank. No representative of the Republic of Ecuador or Petroecuador appeared thereat. At 9:45 a.m., the President started the hearing, a stenographic transcript of which was recorded. A copy of the transcript was provided to each party, including Respondents, on November 13, 2007.\n\n34.\n\nFirst, the President asked the Secretary to let the record reflect the manner in and times on which Respondents had been called to the hearing. Next, the President asked City Oriente to state whether the hearing should be held in the absence of Respondents, and whether it agreed that it be held at the ICSID seat in Washington, D.C.; City Oriente answered both questions in the affirmative.\n\n35.\n\nThen, the Tribunal allowed Claimant its turn to submit its arguments on the request for provisional measures.\n\n36.\n\nCity Oriente started by reporting that, two days earlier, on November 7, Petroecuador's Executive president had requested the Minister of Mines and Oil to start the procedure for an administrative declaration of termination of the production Contract for oil Block No. 27, on the grounds of the company's constant refusal to settle the amounts due to the State of Ecuador after the enactment of Law No. 200642. As evidence of its allegations, it submitted a copy of Press Release No. 180, issued by Petroecuador itself and published on its website, publicly announcing such decision. Claimant also stated that the State's share of oil companies' extra revenue under Law No. 2006-42 had recently been raised to 99%. Claimant went on to claim that City Oriente officers Messrs. Ford, Paez and Y\u00e9pez, who had been personally charged in the criminal actions in Ecuador, had to leave the country for fear of being arrested, and had been in the U.S. for three weeks now. They did not dare to return to Quito as they had been scheduled to appear before the Prosecutor on November 19, 21 and 23, 2007. City Oriente also stated that, because of the other contracting party's breaches, in 2006 it had to suspend its investment plan for Block 27.\n\n37.\n\nAfter explaining the applicable law, Claimant ended by asking the Tribunal to order the provisional measures in the same terms as under its October 24, 2007 decision.\n\n38.\n\nFollowing Claimant's presentation, the Tribunal asked, among other questions, whether, should the provisional measures requested against Ecuador and Petroecuador be passed and observed and complied with, City Oriente would be willing to reinstate its investment plan for Block 27. In responding to such question, City Oriente stated as follows:\n\n*\"In the event that the provisional measured passed by the Tribunal should allow our operations to be resumed, as we expect, then City Oriente would most certainly be willing to continue to perform the Contract regularly as it has done so far. That is precisely City Oriente 's goal, to have the Contract complied with and performed until its expiration in 2021. There will certainly be an aspect that might present problems in Contract performance, such as maintaining its financing or recovering the financing in place before the measures were adopted by the Government of Ecuador. However, City Oriente's intention and goal is most certainly to perform the Contract. And, should the measures remain in place until an award is rendered, then it is certainly willing to do so. \"* [Unofficial translation.]\n\n**II. Legal analysis**\n----------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe dispute underlying this arbitration is strictly contractual in nature. On March 29, 1995, City Oriente, Ecuador and Petroecuador entered into a Contract governed by the laws of Ecuador; the parties thereby agreed that any disputes would be settled through ICSID arbitration. In its claim on the merits, Claimant has asked that the Contract be performed, pursuant to Section 1505 of the C.C., reserving its right to claim for damages, if necessary.\n\n40.\n\nBasically, City Oriente has argued that the Contract was regularly performed as agreed since its execution in 1995 until the enactment of Law No. 2006-42. As a result of the application of said Law, Petroecuador demanded that City Oriente make an additional payment that was not originally provided for in the Contract, in an amount in excess of USD 28 million, pursuant to said Law 2006-42. The fact that such additional payment was actually demanded has been evidenced by means of an invoice1 sent by Petroecuador to City Oriente on October 18, 2007, whereby the former claimed payment of USD 28,023,383, on account of:\n\n*\"APPLICATION OF THE LAW AMENDING THE HYDROCARBON LAW, No. 2006-42, PUBLISHED IN SUPPLEMENTARY OFFICIAL GAZETTE No. 257 OF APRIL 25, 2006, AND THE REGULATIONS SUBSTITUTING SAID LAW'S REGULATIONS AND PASSED BY MEANS OF DECREE No. 672, PUBLISHED IN THE SECOND SUPPLEMENTARY OFFICIAL GAZETTE No. 312, OF JULY 13, 2006,**FOR THE PERIOD APRIL 2006 - AGOSTO 2007.\"* [Unofficial translation.]\n\nExhibit 7, attached to City Oriente's submission of October 22, 2007\n\n41.\n\nPetroecuador has not brought into question the genuine nature of the invoice or the demand for payment attached to it.\n\n42.\n\nSupplementing its claim on the merits, City Oriente has asked that the Tribunal order these provisional measures in order that the *status quo ante, i. e.* the legal situation in place prior to the institution of this arbitration, be maintained pending a final award conclusively ending the proceeding.\n\n43.\n\nThe issue of provisional or precautionary measures presents a difficult situation to any Tribunal: on the one hand, granting such measures may be necessary in order to keep the dispute from becoming even worse or to keep Claimant's rights from being impaired and Claimant from being thus deprived of the effective judicial protection to which it is entitled; on the other hand, however, a provisional measure is passed before the Tribunal has had the chance to conduct an in-depth analysis of the arguments on the merits and might be viewed as a preliminary overview of the final award. Therefore, the Tribunal would like the record to reflect that a potential granting of the provisional measures sought by Claimant does not in any wait entail a prejudgment of Claimant's case on the merits, in general, or specifically on the possible effects of Law No. 2006-42 in connection with the Contract. The Tribunal is very much aware that the Law was passed by the Legislative Branch of the State of Ecuador in exercise of its legitimate and undisputed national sovereignty and that, later on, the Ecuadorian Constitutional Tribunal issued the Resolution of August 22, 2006, declaring that such enactment does not entail a violation of the Constitution. It is the duty and right of the branches of the Ecuadorian government to enact such laws as they may deem appropriate in furtherance of common good for Ecuador, and the Tribunal cannot and does not wish to interfere in such law-making task. The Tribunal's role in this case is limited to disposing of any disputes arising in connection with the Contract.\n\n44.\n\nIn order to decide on Claimant's request, the Tribunal shall take the following steps: (1) it will first analyze its own jurisdiction to pass the requested measures, as well as the scope of its decision, (2) next to analyze whether the requirements that need to be met in order for the request to be granted have actually been satisfied, taking proper consideration of Respondents' allegations.\n\n**1. The Tribunal's jurisdiction to order provisional measures and the scope of said measures**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe subject of provisional measures is dealt with both in the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States and in the Arbitration Rules. Because it was so agreed by the parties in clause 20.3.1 of the Contract, the applicable rules are those contained in document *\"ICSID 15'\",* published by the Centre on January 1985.2\n\nSuch agreement between the parties prevails over the rule contained in Article 44 of the Convention, as expressly provided for in the latter provision.\n\n46.\n\nArticle 47 of the Convention provides as follows:\n\n*\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party. \"*\n\n47.\n\nMoreover, Rule 39 (1) provides as follows:\n\n*\"At any time during the proceeding a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures. \"*\n\n48.\n\nThe Contract contains no provision whatsoever prohibiting the adoption of provisional measures. Accordingly, it seems a quite clear fact that the Tribunal is empowered to recommend provisional measures.\n\n49.\n\nIn its November 7, 2007 submission, Petroecuador expressly reserved its right to challenge the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. So far, neither Respondent has done so formally; however, it is true that, pursuant to Rule 41 (1), Respondents are allowed to raise objections to jurisdiction until the expiration of the deadline for filing their memorial.\n\n50.\n\nIrrespective of Respondents' right, which is still valid, to raise an objection to jurisdiction at some point in the future, the fact remains that, at least on a *prima facie* basis and without prejudging its decision, it is the Tribunal's view that, should such an objection be raised, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to make this decision. It should be noted that ICSID's Secretary-General registered City Oriente's request for arbitration, upon the required conclusion (pursuant to Article 36 (3) of the Convention) that the dispute is not manifestly outside of the Centre's jurisdiction. The Tribunal has verified that the Contract, the existence or validity of which has not been brought into question by either party, contains the parties' submission to ICSID arbitration in clause 20.3.3\n\nUnder clause 20.3, effective submission to ICSID arbitration is made conditional upon the Convention -which Ecuador had already signed on January 15, 1986- having been ratified by the Congress of Ecuador. According to Claimant's statements, such ratification took place on February 7, 2001 by virtue of Congress resolution No. R-22-053.\n\n51.\n\nAnother preliminary issue has to do with the binding nature -or otherwise- of any measures potentially ordered by the Tribunal. The questions in this regard arises from the fact that, in accordance with Article 47 of the Convention and Rule 39 (3) of the Rules, the Tribunal is allowed to *\"recommend\"* such provisional measures as it may deem appropriate, even though other provisions of said legal instruments use the word *\"order\"\"* to refer to binding decisions.\n\n52.\n\nThe distinction, however, is more apparent than it is real, since Rule 39 (1) itself does, in its Spanish version, mentions the *\"dictation\"\"* [ordering] of the provisional measures, which demonstrates that, as far as the Rules are concerned, such words are used interchangeably. Even disregarding such semantic discussion, a teleological interpretation of both provisions leads to the conclusion that the provisional measures recommended are necessarily binding. The Tribunal may only order such measures if their adoption is necessary to preserve the rights of the parties and guarantee that the award will fulfill its purpose of providing effective judicial protection. Such goals may only be reached if the measures are binding, and they share the exact same binding nature as the final arbitral award. Therefore, it is the Tribunal's conclusion that the word *\"recommend\"* is equal in value to the word \"*order.\"\"*\n\n53.\n\nIn any event, whatever the meaning ascribed to such words, a failure to comply with orders given to Respondents by the Tribunal in accordance with Article 47 of the Convention will entail a violation of Article 26 thereof, and engage Respondents' liability.\n\n**2. The requirements to be met for the ordering of provisional measures**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe requirements that the Tribunal can take into consideration in ordering provisional measures are (A) that the adoption of such measures be necessary to preserve petitioner's rights, (B) that their ordering be urgent, and (C) that each party has been afforded an opportunity to raise observations. All three requirements will be analyzed next, taking into consideration the arguments raised by Respondents against the granting of the measures.\n\n**(A) Preservation of petitioner's rights**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nBoth Article 47 of the Convention and Rule 39(1) of the Rules require that the provisional measures be necessary to preserve the rights of the requesting party, without providing any further explanations on the subject. This notwithstanding, the works drafted in preparation for the Convention stated that the purpose of the provisional measures needed to be to preserve the *status quo* as between the parties pending a final award by the Tribunal. In other words, it is the Tribunal's view that Article 47 of the Convention provides authorization for the passing of provisional measures prohibiting any action that affects the disputed rights, aggravates the dispute, frustrates the effectiveness of the award or entails having either party take justice into their own hands. Where there is an agreement in place between the parties that has so far defined the framework of their mutual obligations, then the rights to be preserved are, precisely, those that were thereby agreed upon.\n\n56.\n\nCity Oriente is requesting that the Tribunal order provisional measures to maintain the *status quo* existing prior to the enactment of Law No. 2006-42, which it describes as a situation of compliance with the rights and obligations arising from the Contract, pursuant to the terms thereof.\n\n57.\n\nIn the opinion of this Tribunal, the provisional measures requested by Claimant are necessary to preserve Claimant's rights and the claims it has asserted in this arbitration. Indeed, City Oriente is seeking to have the Contract performed pursuant to its original terms and conditions. Ecuador and Petroecuador consider that the rights and obligations arising from the Contract have not been affected or modified as a result of the application of Law No. 2006-42, which is to be fully enforced. Respondents may or may not be right -an issue for the merits of the case on which the Tribunal cannot and should not rule at this stage in the proceedings. However, pending a decision on this dispute, the principle that neither party may aggravate or extend the dispute or take justice into their own hands prevails. Consequently, Ecuador and Petroecuador are required to continue to comply with the obligations voluntarily undertaken through the Contract, as it was executed, and they are required to refrain from declaring its termination or otherwise modifying its content.\n\n58.\n\nClaimant has identified four actions by Ecuador and Petroecuador which, in Claimant's opinion, alter the *status quo* and need to be suspended.\n\n**The demand for payment**\n--------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe first such action is a demand for the payment of over USD 28 million, made by Petroecuador through the issue of the invoice dated October 19, 2007, which was already discussed above. In the Tribunal's view, Respondents are required to refrain from demanding settlement of such payment or any other amount accrued not on account of the application of the original terms and conditions of the Contract but, rather, of Law No. 2006-42. Respondents may obviously file a counterclaim and, should they succeed, the Tribunal will render an award ordering City Oriente to make payment of all such amounts, which award may be enforced by execution of any of City Oriente's rights and assets in Ecuador. However, in the meantime, the *status quo* must be maintained and the principles that the dispute is not to be aggravated and of *pacta sunt servanda* must prevail *.*\n\n**The request for administrative termination**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe second action complained of is Petroecuador's filing of a request for the administrative declaration of termination of the Contract, through its official letter to the Minister of Mines and Oil, based on the company's continued refusal to make payment of the amounts due on account of the application of Law No. 2006-42. Such termination proceeding needs to be stayed since, pursuant to the Contract, all disputes between the parties are to be settled through arbitration. Should Respondents consider that there are grounds warranting termination of the Contract due to the breach of City Oriente's obligations, then such claim must be raised and ruled on in this arbitration.\n\n**The criminal investigation by the Ecuadorian General Prosecutor**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe third action is the opening of a criminal investigation by the Ecuadorian General Prosecutor against Messrs. Ford, Y\u00e9pez and Paez, based on a complaint filed by congressional Representative Gongora Zambrano.\n\n62.\n\nBefore looking further into this subject, the Tribunal notes that it has great respect for the Ecuadorian Judiciary and that it acknowledges Ecuador's sovereign right to prosecute and punish crimes of all kinds perpetrated in its territory. However, it is the Tribunal's view that such undisputed right of the Republic of Ecuador should not be used as a means to coactively secure payment of the amounts allegedly owed by City Oriente pursuant to Law No. 2006-42, since this would entail a violation of the principle that neither party may aggravate or extend the dispute or take justice into their own hands.\n\n63.\n\nThis is precisely the case with the criminal investigation opened by the Ecuadorian General Prosecutor. According to the complaint itself, the alleged crime -embezzlement- was precisely perpetrated through the non-payment of the amounts accrued on account of the application of the new Law.4 Such being the case, it is the Tribunal's view that Ecuador is required to pass such measures as may be required in order for the General Prosecutor, a member of Ecuador's Judiciary and, accordingly, an officer for which the Republic of Ecuador is responsible, to stay any proceedings and actions stemming from the criminal investigation underway that may affect Claimant or Claimant's officers or employees or may require them to make an appearance.\n\nExhibit 1, attached to Claimant's submission of October 22, 2007.\n\n64.\n\nIn its submission of November 8, 2007, Ecuador insisted that the complaint filed by Representative Gongora Zambrano may not be viewed as an act of the State, as it was filed by such person on a personal capacity. The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador on this. Neither the complaint filed by Gongora nor a complaint filed by any other citizen may be attributed to the Republic of Ecuador. However, what should actually be viewed as an act of the State, for which Ecuador is accountable, is the institution of a criminal proceeding by the Prosecutor's Office based on such complaint.\n\n**The complaint filed with the Prosecutor for the District of Pichincha**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe fourth action complained of is the criminal complaint filed by the State Attorney General's Office with the Ecuadorian Prosecutor for the District of Pichincha. According to the statements in the complaint,5 the crime consists in City Oriente's non-payment of the sums due as a result of the application of Law No. 2006-42. The complaint even makes express reference to certain statements made by City Oriente in this arbitration.\n\nExhibit 2, attached to Claimant's submission of October 22, 2007.\n\n66.\n\nFor the reasons set forth in the above paragraphs, it is the view of this Tribunal that Ecuador is required to take such measures as may be necessary in order that the Ecuadorian Prosecutor's Office will not pursue any procedures or make any inquiries that may affect Claimant or Claimant's officers or employees, or which may require them to make an appearance, throughout the full force and effect of this provisional measure.\n\n**(B) Urgency**\n---------------\n\n67.\n\nNeither the Convention nor the Rules make express reference to the urgency requirement in order that the Tribunal may order provisional measures; however, it seems evident that provisional measures are only appropriate if it is impossible to wait for a specific issue to be settled at the merits stage.\n\n68.\n\nIn its submission of November 8, 2007, Ecuador argued that there is no urgency in adopting the measures requested by City Oriente. The termination procedure entails the performance of certain administrative steps; experience has it that a termination proceeding takes over one year. Petroecuador's sending of the invoice is not an extraordinary occurrence but, rather, a new instance of conduct that has been repeated ever since the enactment of Law No. 2006-42. The sending of the latest invoice does not, therefore, create urgency.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with Ecuador on its arguments in this regard. The letter which Petroecuador attached to its latest invoice differs from all previous letters, as it includes a demand for payment *\"notwithstanding any pending proceeding.\"\"* It is thus an attempt to change the pre-existing *status quo.* The same is true of the institution of the proceeding for administrative termination. In the Tribunal's opinion, the passing of the provisional measures is indeed urgent, precisely to keep the enforced collection or termination proceedings from being started, as this operates as a pressuring mechanism, aggravates and extends the dispute and, by itself, impairs the rights which Claimant seeks to protect through this arbitration. Furthermore, where, as is the case here, the issue is to protect the jurisdictional powers of the tribunal and the integrity of the arbitration and the final award, then the urgency requirement is met by the very own nature of the issue.\n\n**(C) Time for raising observations**\n-------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nPursuant to Rule 39(4), the Tribunal \"shall only recommend provisional measures, or modify or revoke its recommendations, after giving each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.\" It should be noted that such provision does not require that each party has actually submitted its observations, but that it has been afforded an opportunity to do so - where, provided that such opportunity has been afforded, a party has failed to do so or has partially done so, the Tribunal will have met the regulatory requirement and there is no obstacle to the ordering of provisional measures.\n\n71.\n\nBefore analyzing Respondents' arguments on this subject, a brief outline of the facts is in order, starting by the steps taken by the Tribunal:\n\n- Through the document dated October 10, 2007, the Tribunal invited Ecuador and Petroecuador to submit their position on the request for provisional measures by October 25;\n\n- Through the document dated October 11, 2007, the Tribunal called Respondents to a first hearing to discuss the requested provisional measures, to be held in Washington, D.C. on November 8 and 9; such call was repeated through the notices of October 31 and of November 5 and 8, 2007, each of which stated that the hearing would be held at the ICSID offices in Washington, D.C.;\n\n- Through the document of October 31, 2007, the Tribunal asked Ecuador and Petroecuador to file, no later than November 8, 2007, a submission providing a detailed description of any actions taken that were covered by the Tribunal's decision of October 24;\n\n- A conference call was held on October 31, 2007; the State Attorney General and legal counsel for Petroecuador participated and had a voice in such conference call.\n\n72.\n\nThe reaction of Ecuador and Petroecuador to the steps taken by the Tribunal was as follows:\n\n- Ecuador filed its first submission on October 19, 2007, requesting a deadline extension; it filed its second submission on October 24, acknowledging the orders issued by the Tribunal on October 24, and stating its intention to comply, as well as asserting allegations based on Section 119 of Ecuador's Constitution;\n\n- Petroecuador filed its first submission on October 29, 2007, containing several allegations in connection with the inapplicability of the claims raised by Claimant;\n\n- On November 8, 2007, a few hours before the start of the hearing scheduled for November 9, Ecuador filed a second submission stating that it would not attend the hearing on the grounds that such hearing was actually to be held in Quito, pursuant to the provisions of clause 20.3.3 of the Contract; said submission included several different additional arguments in support of a denial of the provisional measures requested by Claimant, accompanied by such documentary evidence as Ecuador deemed relevant;\n\n- On the day of the hearing, Petroecuador filed its second submission, also accompanied by documentary evidence, requesting that the requested provisional measures be denied, and arguing that it was \"*in a position of complete defenselessness;\"\"*\n\n- Neither Ecuador nor Petroecuador attended the hearing of November 9, 2007.\n\n73.\n\nBasically, two are the issues raised by Respondents to which the Tribunal must respond: the first one is whether the hearing of November 9, 2007 should have been held in Quito, and the second one is whether Ecuador and Petroecuador were in a position of defenselessness.\n\n**The place of the hearing**\n----------------------------\n\n74.\n\nIt is a true fact that, as noted by Ecuador in its submission of November 9, 2007 and previously indicated during the conference call of October 31, clause 20.3.3 of the Contract starts as follows: \"*The arbitrage will be installed and performed in the city of Quito.*\" However, the same clause goes on to state *\"notwithstanding the arbitration committee's [i.e.* the Tribunal's] *right to move wherever is necessary to perform its duties.* \u2019\u2019Accordingly, clause 20.3.3 allows the Tribunal broad discretion to take procedural steps at any other location it may deem necessary.\n\n75.\n\nIrrespective of the express language of clause 20.3.3 of the Contract, such clause needs to be interpreted in connection with the Convention and the Rules, since the parties subjected themselves to said instruments in the arbitration agreement. The Convention addresses the \"Place of Proceedings\" in Chapter VII, specifically Articles 62 and 63:\n\n\"***Article 62***\n\n*Conciliation and arbitration proceedings shall be held at the seat of the Centre except as hereinafter provided.*\n\n***\"Article 63***\n\n*Conciliation and arbitration proceedings may be held, if the parties so agree:*\n\n*(a) at the seat of the Permanent Court of Arbitration or of any other appropriate institution, whether private or public, with which the Centre may make arrangements for that purpose; or*\n\n*(b) at any other place approved by the Commission or Tribunal after consultation with the Secretary-General. \"*\n\n76.\n\nMoreover, Regulation 26 (1) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations provides as follows:\n\n\"***Regulation 26 Place of Proceedings***\n\n*(1) The Secretary-General shall make arrangements for the holding of conciliation and arbitration proceedings at the seat of the Centre or shall, at the request of the parties and as provided in Article 63 of the Convention, make or supervise arrangements if proceedings are held elsewhere. \"*\n\n77.\n\nThe above-transcribed provisions lead to the conclusion that, as a general rule, ICSID arbitration is held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C., unless the requirements laid down in Article 63 of the Convention are met \u2014the satisfaction of which was not demonstrated by Ecuador.\n\n78.\n\nAccordingly, it is the Tribunal's view that the hearing of November 9 was correctly organized and held at the seat of ICSID in Washington, D.C. That said, the Tribunal notes that it does not object to the performance of future procedural steps in Quito, provided that the requirements prescribed in the Convention are satisfied.\n\n79.\n\nLastly, the Tribunal notes that the call to the Washington hearing was issued on October 11, 2007, virtually one month before the date scheduled for the hearing. The call was repeated on several occasions, in spite of which neither Ecuador nor Petroecuador did at any time object to the place of proceedings set by the Tribunal. It was only a few hours before the scheduled time of the hearing that Respondent first objected to the selected place. An objection raised so late, at a time when both Claimant and the members of the Tribunal had already traveled to Washington, D.C., is to be dismissed as it is evidently untimely.\n\n**Respondents' alleged defenselessness**\n----------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nPetroecuador has argued that, by actually holding the November 9, 2007 hearing, the Tribunal pushed Respondents into a *\"position of complete defenselessness.*\" According to Petroecuador, the reason for this is that neither Respondent was afforded enough time to select an international law firm to defend their rights in this arbitration.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal understands and respects Ecuador and Petroecuador's desire to have legal counsel adequately representing them in this arbitration. That said, the Tribunal notes that the request for arbitration was filed on October 10, 2006, and Ecuador and Petroecuador have thus had almost one year to appoint legal counsel. Furthermore, the law applicable to the merits of the case is the law of Ecuador and, accordingly, the State Attorney General's Office and Petroecuador's internal counsel, made up of highly qualified attorneys who are experts in Ecuadorian law, should have sufficient technical knowledge to adequately defend Respondents' interests. That said, in a gesture of deference to the problems mentioned by Ecuador, the Tribunal has stated that it is willing to postpone the procedural hearing to January 11, 2008. However, the Tribunal considers that no such extension may be granted in connection with the provisional measures. By their very own nature, such measures are urgent. Rule 39(2) requires that \"*the Tribunal shall give priority to the consideration of a request\"* for provisional measures. It is only in breach of this provision that the Tribunal could have possibly postponed the November 9 hearing.\n\n**Summing up**\n--------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it has afforded Respondents the opportunity to present their observations to the request for provisional measures as required under Rule 39(4). Respondents have actually filed their respective submissions containing their allegations, accompanied by such evidence as they deemed relevant. The Tribunal has carefully analyzed the arguments set forth in such submissions and has replied to them in this decision. There has been no violation of due process or any step that may have caused Respondents to become defenseless.\n\n**3. Ordering of provisional measures**\n---------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that City Oriente's request for provisional measures must be granted, as it meets the requirements laid down in the Convention and the Centre's Arbitration Rules: the measures are necessary to preserve Claimant's rights, their passing is urgent and they are recommended once each party has been afforded sufficient opportunity to raise observations.\n\n84.\n\nIn rendering this decision, the Tribunal has taken careful consideration of Claimant's promise to reinstate its investment plan, as stated in paragraph 38 above, provided that Respondents have previously effectively and continuously complied with the provisional measures hereby ordered.\n\n85.\n\nEven though they were afforded sufficient opportunity to raise observations, which they did in fact do in writing, it is a fact that Respondents chose not to appear at the November 9 hearing, to which they had been repeatedly called. The Tribunal regrets Respondents' decision and does not intend for Respondents' failure to appear to deprive them of their lawful right to submit arguments on an equal footing with Claimant, and as extensively as possible. By their very own nature, provisional measures may be modified or revoked at any time. The Tribunal has scheduled a new procedural hearing for January 11, 2008. Should either party and, specifically, either Respondent, request that the agenda for such hearing be extended to include the modification or revocation of the provisional measures, the Tribunal will be willing to do so.\n\n86.\n\nAt the hearing, Claimant requested that the costs arising in connection with these ancillary proceedings be borne by Respondents. It is the Tribunal's view that this is not the appropriate stage for such a decision to be made, and it will therefore postpone such decision until the rendering of the final award.\n\n**III. Case Law**\n-----------------\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal has arrived at this decision by carrying out an independent analysis, applying and interpreting the Contract, the Convention and the Arbitration Rules. In its arguments, Claimant made reference to a number of awards and decisions rendered in other cases in which the tribunals were faced with similar situations. The Tribunal finds it appropriate to check its own conclusions against those reached in such cases, as consistency across different awards will increase legal predictability and certainty. However, the Tribunal notes that the decisions of ICSID or other Tribunals are not binding and that each case needs to be analyzed in the light of its own circumstances.\n\n88.\n\nClaimant has brought up the early decision of the International Court of Justice in *The**Electricity Company of Sofia - Belgium v. Bulgaria.6* Both the facts and the decision are actually closely connected to the instant case.\n\nPCIJ, Ser. A/B, No. 79, 1939.\n\n89.\n\nThe dispute between the parties concerned certain amounts which the Sofia Electricity Company allegedly owed to the Municipality of Sofia. While the arbitration was pending, the Municipality of Sofia started enforced collection of the amounts owed. Belgium, which was the claimant in that case, requested that the Court issue provisional measures, staying such enforced collection. The hearing was scheduled to be held on December 4, 1939. Bulgaria did not appear, on account of the declaration of World War II. The Court did hold the hearing nevertheless and, next, a provisional measure was granted, ordering Bulgaria to take all measures required in order not to impair the rights asserted by Belgium and not to aggravate or extend the dispute pending before the Court.\n\n90.\n\nA similar conclusion was arrived at in the \"Decision on Provisional Measures\" in the ICSID case of *Victor Pey Casado and Fundacion Presidente Allende v. The Republic of Chile.7* In such decision, the Tribunal *\"invit[ed] the parties to strictly observe the general legal principle under which either party to a lawsuit is required to make sure to prevent any action that might entail prejudgment of the rights of the other party at the time of enforcement of the arbitral award on the merits, and to prevent any action of any nature whatsoever which might aggravate or extend the dispute pending before the tribunal \"* [unofficial translation].\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/98/2\n\n91.\n\nThe possibility that a provisional measure issued in the course of an ICSID arbitration will extend to proceedings and decisions by the judiciary of the respondent State was accepted in *Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v The Republic of Slovakia,8* in which the Tribunal recommended that a bankruptcy proceeding pending in Slovakia be stayed, insofar as it interfered in the dispute submitted to arbitration.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Procedural Order No. 4.\n\n92.\n\nThe conclusion by the Tribunal in the instant case that, for the purposes of Article 47 of the Convention, the words \"order\" and \"recommend\" are used interchangeably has been supported in, at least, two earlier decisions. In *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. the Kingdom of Spain9* the Tribunal interpreted the textual language and the purpose of said article and arrived at the conclusion that \"*the word \u2018recommend' [is] of similar value as the word \u2018order. '\"* A similar conclusion was established in the Tribunal's decision in *Victor Pey Casado,* which has already been mentioned above. In its arguments, the Tribunal relied not only on the interpretation of Article 47 of the Convention but also on the International Court of Justice's decision in *LaGrand -Germany v. U.S.A..10* Article 41 of the Statute of the Court allows the Court to *\"indicate\"\"* provisional measures. In *LaGrand,* the Court held that, in spite of the specific verb used, provisional measures indicated in accordance with said article are binding.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No.2.\n\n*LaGrand* Case (F.RG. v. U.S.), 2001 I.C.J.\n\n**IV. Decision**\n----------------\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal unanimously decides to adopt the following provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention:\n\n1. The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador) shall refrain from\n\n- Instituting or prosecuting, if already in place, any judicial proceeding or action of any nature whatsoever against or involving City Oriente Limited and/or its officers or employees and arising from or in connection with the Contract of March 29, 1995 and/or the effects of the application of Law No. 2006-42, the Law Amending the Hydrocarbon Law, to said Contract;\n\n- Demanding that City Oriente Limited pay any amounts as a result of the application of Law No. 2006-42, the Law Amending the Hydrocarbon Law, to the Contract of March 29, 1995;\n\n- Engaging in, starting or persisting in any other conduct that may directly or indirectly affect or alter the legal situation agreed upon under the Contract of March 29, 1995, as thereby agreed upon and executed by the parties.\n\n2. These provisional measures shall remain in full force and effect unless and until modified or revoked by the Tribunal or until the rendering of the final award.\n\n3. The Tribunal's communication of October 24, 2007 is hereby invalidated.\n\n4. The Tribunal preserves for later resolution its decision on the costs arising from this ancillary proceeding."}, {"Title": "Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures and Other Procedural Matters", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2008-05-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Revocation of Provisional Measures and Other Procedural Matters\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Procedural Issues**\n------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn November 19, 2007, the Arbitral Tribunal unanimously resolved to order the following provisional measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention [hereinafter, the \"Provisional Measures\"]1:\n\n\"1. The Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador [Petroecuador] shall refrain from\n\n- Instituting or prosecuting, if already in place, any judicial proceeding or action of any nature whatsoever against or involving City Oriente Limited and/or its officers or employees and arising from or in connection with the Contract of March 29, 1995, and/or the effects of the application of Law No. 2006-42, the Law Amending the Hydrocarbon Law, to that Contract;\n\n- Demanding that City Oriente Limited pay any amounts as a result of the application of Law No. 2006-42, the Law Amending the Hydrocarbon Law, to the Contract of March 29, 1995;\n\n- Engaging in, starting or persisting in any other conduct that may directly or indirectly affect or alter the legal situation agreed upon under the Contract of March 29, 1995, as thereby agreed upon and executed by the parties.\n\n2. These provisional measures shall remain in full force and effect unless and until modified or revoked by the Tribunal or until the rendering of the final award.\n\n3. The Tribunal\u2019s communication of October 24, 2007, is hereby invalidated.\n\n4. The Tribunal preserves for later resolution its decision on the costs arising from this proceeding.\"\n\n*See* the Decision dated November 19, 2007 for an account of procedural developments prior to the passing of the Provisional Measures.\n\n2.\n\nThe Provisional Measures ordered that a procedural hearing be held [the \"First Session\"], the Agenda of which could include, at the request of either party, a motion to amend or revoke such Provisional Measures.\n\n3.\n\nThereafter, through a letter dated November 27, 2007, Claimant informed the Tribunal of certain events occurred following the passing of the Provisional Measures, which\u2014in Claimant\u2019s opinion\u2014entailed a violation of such Measures.\n\n4.\n\nThus, Claimant requested that the Tribunal order the State\u2019s Attorney General to communicate the Provisional Measures to all Government Authorities.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal notified that request to Respondents, establishing that any allegations in connection therewith were to be submitted by November 30, 2007. Respondents objected to the contents of Claimant's letter through letter dated November 30, 2007, and argued that the term established by the Tribunal to present further allegations was insufficient, and reserved themselves the right to present those allegations at a later date. In response to Respondents\u2019 request, the Tribunal extended the term until December 5.\n\n6.\n\nWithin the new term, by letter dated December 4, 2007, Respondents alleged that notice of the Provisional Measures had been served on both the Chief Justice of the Second Division of the Supreme Court of Justice and the Ecuadorian Prosecutor, and once again denied the contents of Claimant\u2019s letter.\n\n7.\n\nBy a communication sent to the parties on December 20, 2007, the Tribunal convened the parties to the First Session, provided for in rule 13(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, to be held on January 11, 2008, at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C., as previously communicated in the Provisional Measures. Moreover, it informed the parties of the provisional agenda of that session and urged them to cooperate to come to an agreement on certain procedural aspects.\n\n8.\n\nIn response to the invitation to the First Session made in the Provisional Measures, Respondents requested that the amendment or revocation of the Provisional Measures be incorporated into the Provisional Agenda.\n\n9.\n\nIn turn, on December 27, 2007, Claimant informed the Tribunal of the procedural arrangements agreed upon regarding the schedule, the nonseparation of the decision on jurisdiction and the decision on the merits, and the method for the filing of written submissions. The agreements were later ratified by Respondents. Additionally, the parties requested that the date of the First Session be postponed.\n\n10.\n\nBy a communication dated January 7, 2007, the Tribunal acknowledged the agreements reached by the parties and set the hearing for March 6, 2008.\n\n11.\n\nThrough a letter dated January 11, 2008, Respondents informed that the parties had agreed on a specific schedule for the filing of pleadings related to a potential revocation of the Provisional Measures. Moreover, they requested that the Tribunal render a decision on whether to uphold or, if applicable, revoke the Provisional Measures based solely on the parties\u2019 submissions on the issue, without an audience, and asked Claimant to express their view on the matter. By letter dated January 22, 2008, Claimant stated that it had no objections to such proposal.\n\n12.\n\nIn response to the request made by the Tribunal through letter dated January 7, 2008, the parties informed the Tribunal of the agreements reached on all items on the provisional agenda communicated to the parties on December 20, 2007, except for two items, namely:\n\n- Fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal (item 2 on the Provisional Agenda);\n\n- Place of the Proceeding (item 13 on the Provisional Agenda.)\n\n13.\n\nAccordingly, through a communication dated February 21, 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal resolved as follows:\n\n- To cancel the hearing scheduled for March 6, 2008; and\n\n- To open a simultaneous proceeding until March 3, 2008, for the parties to file their written submissions regarding the two procedural issues pending agreement.\n\n14.\n\nPursuant to the schedule agreed upon, on February 1, 2008, Respondents filed their Request for Revocation of the Provisional Measures [hereinafter, \"Request for Revocation.\"] Likewise, on February 22, 2008, Claimant filed its Reply to the Request for Revocation of the Provisional Measures [hereinafter, \"Reply to the Request.\"]\n\n15.\n\nFinally, the parties timely filed their written submissions on the two procedural issues pending agreement.\n\n16.\n\nAs a result, this decision has a threefold purpose:\n\n- first, to rule on the Request for Revocation of the Provisional Measures filed by Respondents (II);\n\n- second, to determine the rules applicable to the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal (III); and\n\n- finally, to set the place where the proceeding is to be held (IV).\n\n**II. Request for Revocation of the Provisional Measures**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n17.\n\nBefore embarking on an in-depth analysis of the request for revocation of the Provisional Measures, we will provide a brief outline of the most significant facts underlying this claim in order to set the framework of the dispute:\n\n- On March 29, 1995, City Oriente, Ecuador and Petroecuador entered into a Contract subject to the laws of Ecuador, and the parties agreed that any controversy arising in connection therewith was to be settled by way of arbitration before the ICSID;\n\n- On October 10, 2006, City Oriente filed a request for arbitration with ICSID demanding that Ecuador and Petroecuador be ordered to perform the Contract pursuant to Section 1505 of the Civil Code [the \"Civil Code\"] which, in Claimant\u2019s opinion, grants such relief. Moreover, City Oriente reserved its right to a potential claim for damages, if necessary;\n\n- City Oriente\u2019s main argument is that the Contract was regularly performed as agreed, since its execution in 1995 until the enactment of Law No. 2006-42 on April 25, 2006. Under that Law, regulated by Decree No. 1672 dated July 11, 2006, Petroecuador demanded that City Oriente make an additional payment that was not originally provided for in the Contract, in an amount in excess of USD37 million2; and Claimant has refused to make such payment;\n\n- Then, Petroecuador filed an administrative claim requiring that the termination of the Contract be declared due to City Oriente\u2019s failure to pay the amounts owed under Law No. 2006-42;\n\n- On October 17, 2007, the Ecuadorian Prosecutor ordered that a criminal investigation be opened against Messrs. Ford, Y\u00e9pez and P\u00e1ez, executives of City Oriente, on alleged charges of embezzlement due\u2014precisely\u2014to the failure to pay the additional amounts owed by Claimant as a result of the application of the newly enacted law;\n\n- On October 18, 2007, the State's General Attorney's Office filed a complaint with the Prosecutor of Pichincha alleging that City Oriente\u2019s failure to pay the amounts owed under Law 2006-42 constituted a crime.\n\nAccording to a letter sent by Petroecuador dated January 15, 2008, the debt amounted to USD 37,730,481 ; Cf. Exhibit 1 to the Reply to the Request filed by City Oriente.\n\n18.\n\nIn light of these events, on November 19, 2007, the Arbitral Tribunal ordered the Provisional Measures pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention. On February 1, 2008, Respondents requested that the Provisional Measures be overturned and Claimant objected to such request in its Reply dated February 22.\n\n19.\n\nIn their submission, Respondents based their request on three major arguments: first, that the Provisional Measures seek to protect an inexistent right; second, that they are not necessary to prevent irreparable harm; and finally, that the decision on provisional measures entails a ruling on the merits. Each of these lines of argumentation is addressed individually below.\n\n20.\n\nBefore addressing each of the arguments raised by Respondent, it must be noted that this decision relates to the Provisional Measures, not to the merits of the case. Thus, the party requesting the measure need only prove that its claim has the appearance of good right, *fumus boni inris,* or, in other words, the petitioner must prove that the rights invoked are plausible. Accordingly, the Tribunal\u2019s decision is merely provisional and is subject to revocation at any time; moreover, the passing of such measures does not at all impact the decision on the merits to be eventually rendered once the proceedings have been fully substantiated.\n\n**2. The Provisional Measures Seek to Protect an Inexistent Right**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\n(i) Ecuador and Petroecuador argue that no demand for performance of the Contract has been filed under Ecuadorian Law, and that the Arbitral Tribunal cannot interfere with the application of Law No. 2006-42. Claimant mistakenly cites Section 1505 of the Civil Code, related to performance, but this section does not apply to the case under analysis, for administrative contracts are not subject to implied termination provisions nor do the rights granted by such provisions in private law apply to such contracts. The alleged breach by the State could only give rise to a claim for damages, and would never result in Ecuador being subject to any prohibition.\n\n22.\n\n(ii) Respondents further allege that City Oriente is not entitled to the rendering of an award annulling the termination provided for under this Law. Termination is a public power of the Ecuadorian State, recognized by both the Hydrocarbon Law and by Clause 21 of the Contract. It is an extraordinary power for self-protection, by virtue of which the contracts entered into by the State are subjected to a regime different from the one applicable to contracts entered into by private parties. The State may protect itself in certain conditions without need of seeking judicial protection. Thus, the termination exceeds the scope of this arbitration, and the Arbitral Tribunal cannot order its stay.\n\n23.\n\n(iii) Furthermore, Respondents argue that Law No. 2006-42 sets forth a new duty to pay an additional amount of money which does not result from the Contract but from the Law, pursuant to Section 1453 of the Civil Code. No Judicial Court -let alone an Arbitral Tribunal\u2014can stay the effects of a law enacted by the Ecuadorian Congress.\n\n24.\n\n(iv) Ecuador and Petroecuador finally argue that there is no general, autonomous and abstract principle to prevent the aggravation of the dispute that would automatically justify the passing of provisional measures. If there is no substantive right to be protected, the principle of non-aggravation does not warrant the passing of provisional measures. In any case, since the only remedy available to Claimant would be a potential damage award, the increase of such damages could never constitute sufficient grounds for the passing of the Provisional Measures.\n\n25.\n\nThis summarizes the arguments submitted by Respondents. The Tribunal will now analyze each of the four lines of argumentation individually.\n\n*(i) Ecuadorian Law does Not Provide for Demand for Specific Performance*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nFirst, Respondents argue that City Oriente demands \"specific performance\" of the Contract, and that there is no legal basis underpinning such claim in Ecuadorian Law.\n\n27.\n\nIn effect, City Oriente does not demand \"*specific* performance\" of the Contract, but merely its \"performance.\"3 This is more than a mere semantic distinction. Claimant is not requesting that the Arbitral Tribunal *force* Respondents to perform the Contract, which clearly exceeds the power of any arbitrator. In these arbitration proceedings, City Oriente is only asserting a claim for contract performance. In other words, all it asks is that Respondents be ordered to fulfill the commitments undertaken under the applicable contract, and an arbitrator does have the power to issue such an order. Later, if the party ordered to perform the contract refuses to comply with such order, a different issue will arise in connection with the recognition and enforcement of the arbitration award; this issue exceeds the claims made by the parties to this arbitration proceedings and the jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal.4\n\nCf. Request for Arbitration, at 17.\n\nCf. Article 54 of the Convention and Schreuer\u2019s Comment: *\"The ICSID Convention\",* Cambridge 2001, page 1110 *et seq.*\n\n28.\n\nThus, City Oriente requests that Ecuador and Petroecuador be ordered to fulfill their duties, and seeks to base this claim on Section 1561 and 1505 of the Civil Code, which provide as follows:\n\nSection 1561:\n\n\"Any contract duly executed constitutes law for the parties and may only be voided by mutual consent or on legal grounds.\"\n\nSection 1505:\n\n\"Any bilateral contract is subject to an implied termination provision upon default by one of the parties. In that event, the nonbreaching party may demand, at its discretion, termination or performance of the contract, with a claim for damages.\"\n\n29.\n\nAccording to Claimant, it clearly arises from interpreting the sections above that, in the event of default of a bilateral contract, the party *in bonis* (\"the nonbreaching party,\" in the terms of Section 1505 Civil Code) may choose (\"demand, at its discretion\") between two alternatives: to demand performance or to terminate the contract, apart from a claim for damages. City Oriente explains that the Ecuadorian State is attempting to amend the Contract unilaterally in violation to the provisions set out in Section 1561 Civil Code, and that, faced with this violation, it has chosen the first alternative provided by Section 1505 Civil Code - a demand for performance of the Contract.\n\n30.\n\nIn response to Claimant's arguments, Respondents have based their defense on two basic arguments:\n\n- that Section 1505 of the Civil Code does not apply to this case because administrative contracts are not subject to any such implied termination provision; and\n\n- the alleged default on the part of the State could only give rise to a claim for damages.\n\n31.\n\nThe first argument is untenable, for it rests on a misinterpretation of Claimant\u2019s request: City Oriente has not opted for the right to termination provided for under Section 1505 of the Civil Code, also known as implied termination provision in Civil Law. Conversely, it has chosen to demand performance of the Contract. Thus, the issue whether a contractor party to an administrative contract subject to Ecuadorian Law may or may not terminate the contract in the event of default on the part of the State is completely irrelevant for the purposes of this arbitration.\n\n32.\n\nThe second argument underpinning Respondents\u2019 defense is that oil production administrative contracts are not subject to Ecuadorian Civil Law other than by way of exception; thus, upon default by the State, contractor cannot demand performance of contractual duties, and the only remedy at its disposal is a claim for damages.\n\nExpert Opinion by Dr, Andrade Ubidia\n------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nRespondents have cited no Ecuadorian Laws, doctrine or jurisprudence in support of their arguments, but only the opinion of a lawyer, Dr. Andrade Ubidia.5 In this opinion, which the Tribunal has found to be undated, Dr. Andrade Ubidia bases his analysis on the assumption that the administrative contract subject matter of his opinion has already expired due to an administrative sanction. Based on this assumption, he concludes that the Contract is \"fatally concluded; and it would be futile to seek performance or termination thereof.\"\n\nDocument RA 7.\n\n34.\n\nThe expert refers to facts which are completely different to those that gave rise to these arbitration proceedings, where the case is precisely the opposite: this Contract has not expired, but is still in force (despite the expiration proceedings commenced by the State), and the contractor requests that the State be ordered to fulfill the duties undertaken under such contract. The opinion of Dr. Andrade Ubidia does not contribute to proving the allegations made by Respondents that the sole remedy available to a contractor upon default by the State under Ecuadorian Administrative Law is a claim for damages, and that it has no right to demand performance.\n\n35.\n\nIn response to Dr. Andrade Ubidia\u2019s expert opinion, Claimant has offered a series of judicial decisions which\u2014in its opinion\u2014would prove that the principles set forth in the Civil Code apply to Contracts entered into by the State,6 so that the action for performance provided for under Section 1505 of the Civil Code may also be asserted in this type of contracts.\n\nReply to the Request for Revocation, \u00b6 71.\n\n36.\n\nAmong the Decisions cited, there is one related to facts similar to those analyzed in these arbitration proceedings: *Tecco v. LEOS,* Supreme Court of Justice, Fourth Division, July 25, 1983.7\n\nC 38.\n\n***Tecco v. IEOS***\n-------------------\n\n37.\n\nTecco C\u00eda. Ltda. [\"Tecco\"] was a construction company that had entered into an administrative contract with the Ecuadorian Body of Sanitation Works [\"IEOS,\" for its Spanish acronym] for the construction of a dam on the Paj\u00e1n River. Upon commencement of construction works, the IEOS refused to make the down payment required under the contract. Faced with IEOS default, Tecco commenced judicial proceedings requesting that the IEOS be ordered to perform the contract and to make the down payment required thereunder, and a court declaration that the 18-month period would commence upon such payment and an order to commence the works. The lower court dismissed the defenses raised by the IEOS, admitted plaintiffs claims and ordered the IEOS to perform the contract. The Supreme Court of Justice upheld the lower court decision on appeal, arguing as follows:\n\n\"Five: Sections 1582 [now 1561] and 1532 [now 1505] of the Civil Code provide that any contract properly executed constitutes law to the parties thereto, and may only be voided by mutual consent or on legal grounds. These sections further provide that all bilateral contracts contain an implied termination provision upon default by one of the parties. In such event, the non-breaching party may demand, at its discretion, termination or performance of the contract, with a claim for damages. In the case under analysis, to date, the contract has not been voided, and plaintiff has chosen to demand performance. Thus, it is entitled to a down payment, which payment shall accrue interest at a rate of 14% from the date of service of the complaint; and the term for construction shall begin upon payment of such amount and upon issuance of an order instructing that works be commenced.\"\n\n38.\n\nThus, there is at least one decision of an Ecuadorian High Court where Sections 1561 and 1505 of the Civil Code were applied to a contract entered into by and between a private person and a public body, where the Court admitted Plaintiffs claim and ordered the public entity to perform its contractual duties. Now well, the Arbitral Tribunal passes no judgment as to whether this Decision constitutes case law, whether it reflects a consistent and uniform position in Ecuadorian Law or whether it applies to this case.\n\n***Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador***\n-------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nRespondents also cite an arbitration decision rendered in another ICSID case in support of their argument that an ICSID Tribunal lacks the power to order a public entity to comply with an administrative contract, namely, the decision on Provisional Measures in the case between *Occidental Petroleum* and the Republic of Ecuador.8 In this decision, the Arbitral Tribunal came to the following conclusion:\n\n\"It is well established that where a State has, in the exercise of its sovereign powers, put an end to a contract or a license, or any other foreign investor\u2019s entitlement, specific performance must be deemed legally impossible.\"9\n\n*Occidental Petroleum Corporation and Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/01); Decision on Provisional Measures dated August 17, 2007; RA 4.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures cited in Note 8, \u00b6 79.\n\n40.\n\nThe *Occidental Petroleum* case differs greatly from these proceedings.\n\n41.\n\n(a) In the *Occidental Petroleum* case, on May 15, 2006, the Ministry of Energy and Mines entered a *Caducidad* Decree (Expiration Order) ordering the termination of the participation contract entered into between the parties on May 21, 1999. In response to such measure, Occidental Petroleum filed a request for arbitration with the ICSID, seeking (among other things) an order to declare null and void the *Caducidad* Decree. The case is precisely the opposite in these proceedings: on October 10, 2006, City Oriente filed a Request for Arbitration arguing that the counterparty had defaulted upon the contract by demanding payment of additional amounts under Law No. 2006-42 and demanding performance with the contractual commitments undertaken. It was not until later that Petroecuador requested the issuance of an Expiration Order based on the same events that had led City Oriente to file this arbitration: non-payment of the additional amounts demanded under Law No. 2006-42.\n\n42.\n\n(b) There is a second difference, of a legal nature: the *Occidental Petroleum* case is governed by the BIT between the US and the Republic of Ecuador;10 while at the current stage of these proceedings, the Arbitral Tribunal must examine a request for provisional measures in the framework of a case where Claimant demands that Respondents be ordered to perform a Contract subject to Ecuadorian Law.\n\nDecision on Provisional Measures cited in Note 8, \u00b6 2.\n\n43.\n\nThe differences between both arbitrations are material. The *Occidental Petroleum* Tribunal has concluded that in arbitration proceedings subject to international law a claimant cannot demand performance of a contract previously terminated by the State by virtue of its sovereign powers. Nonetheless, this conclusion may not be directly extended to contract arbitration such as these proceedings, which, moreover, were commenced before the expiration order.\n\n44.\n\nIn this regard, the Republic of Ecuador has argued in a submission filed to defend its position in *Occidental Petroleum* that Claimant cannot demand performance of the contract terminated through an expiration order, because the contract may only be terminated through a judicial complaint *[recurso de plena jurisdicci\u00f3n]* before the Ecuadorian Courts.11 The recognition of the existence of this remedy by the Republic itself, added to the decision of the Supreme Court of Justice in the *Tecco* case mentioned above12 would seem to indicate\u2014at least initially\u2014that, under certain circumstances, under Ecuadorian Law a Court may order the performance of administrative contracts at the request of one of the parties.\n\nRequesting that the administrative termination order be declared null and void; cf. \u00b6 46 of the Decision on Provisional Measures cited in note 8.\n\nCf. \u00b6 36 *supra.*\n\n45.\n\nTo sum up: at this stage, the sole decision to be made by the Arbitral Tribunal is whether the party requesting the provisional measures, City Oriente, has been able to prove *fumus boni inris,* an appearance of good right. Weighing and analyzing the evidence offered by the parties so far, and without advancing a decision on the merits, the Arbitral Tribunal does not discard the conclusion that under Ecuadorian Law a contractor may demand that the public entity it contracted with be ordered to fulfill its commitments.\n\n46.\n\nFor Claimants have proven the appearance of such right, pursuant to Article 47 of the Convention the Arbitral Tribunal may order any Provisional Measures it deems necessary to protect such right. Thus, the Tribunal dismisses Respondents\u2019 Request that the Provisional Measures be revoked on these grounds.\n\n*(ii) The Expiration Order Cannot be Stayed*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nSecond, Respondents argue that City Oriente is not entitled to an award staying the expiration order issued pursuant to Ecuadorian Law and ratified in Clause 21 of the Contract. The expiration order would then exceed the scope of these arbitration proceedings and the Arbitral Tribunal would not have jurisdiction to order the stay thereof.\n\n48.\n\nIt is undisputed that Clause 21 of the Contract expressly provides that an expiration order issued by the Ministry of Energy and Mines [now the Ministry of Mines and Oil] on the grounds and through the procedure established in the Hydrocarbon Law would terminate the Contract.\n\n49.\n\nThe termination procedure set forth in the Hydrocarbon Law and in Clause 21 of the Contract is one of the mechanisms for self-protection awarded by the legal regime to the Public Administration, as correctly asserted by Respondents. Under Ecuadorian Law, congress and the courts have admitted that public entities have a right to terminate an administrative contract unilaterally\u2014either through the implied termination provision established in the Civil Code13 or through the special procedures provided for under Specific Laws. It is undisputed that the termination procedure provided for under the Hydrocarbon Law belongs in this last category.\n\nFor example, see the Decision *Narvaez Camacho c. INECEL,* Case 3168, Official Gazette of the Administrative Court, No. 10, 1991, at 129 *et seq.* RA 18.\n\n50.\n\nNow well, the Contract also contains Clause 20.3, which provides as follows: \"the parties commit themselves to submit controversies or disagreements related to or resulting from this Contract to the jurisdiction of the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disagreements (ICSID);\" and the same Clause 20.3.5 goes on to add that the filing of a request for arbitration shall not cause the suspension of the Contract, but the Contract will continue to be regularly performed. Finally, Clause 21.4 sets forth that arbitration will be the method of choice to decree the termination of the Contract, without prejudice to an expiration order by the State itself (pursuant to the Hydrocarbon Law.)\n\n51.\n\nThus, clauses 20.3 and 21 of the Contract raise a difficult issue concerning the relationship between these arbitration proceedings and the administrative expiration proceedings, considering that the parties have provided scarce allegations. At this stage in the proceedings, the Arbitral Tribunal does not need to decide whether expiration proceedings must be commenced seeking termination of the Contract once the other party has already filed a request for arbitration demanding performance thereof in a case where the factual background of both proceedings is exactly the same. The Tribunal must resolve upon another issue: the Tribunal must determine whether it must order a stay of the expiration proceedings in order to protect the rights that City Oriente apparently has.14\n\nCf. Art. 47 of the Convention.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal has already established, *prima facie,* that under Ecuadorian Law a contractor has the right to demand the public entity with which it contracted to perform the duties undertaken in the contract; in the specific case of City Oriente, it is so demanding through this arbitration. This right would be impaired if, during these arbitration proceedings, Respondents may commence expiration proceedings and terminate the Contract unilaterally. Were the Tribunal to allow such a course of events, any hypothetical final award in favor of Claimant ordering performance of the Contract would be impossible to execute, for the Contract would no longer be in existence, and City Oriente would have already been forced to surrender all of its assets to the State and would no longer be in charge of hydrocarbon exploitation.15\n\nClause 21.2. of the Contract and Section 75 of the Hydrocarbon Law.\n\n53.\n\nLet us now analyze the opposite scenario: if the Tribunal finally renders a final award in favor of Respondents, thus dismissing City Oriente\u2019s claims, there would be no obstacles hindering the enforcement of such decision. Respondents would then be free to resume the expiration proceedings forthwith, terminate the Contract and take over City Oriente's assets.\n\n54.\n\nUpon weighing the interests at stake, the Arbitral Tribunal must choose to protect the possibility of enforcing a hypothetical award favorable to Claimant, even at the cost of temporarily depriving Respondents\u2019 of their contractual right to self-protection. Thus, given that Claimant has already commenced arbitration proceedings demanding performance of the Contract, Claimant has a right to request that Respondents refrain from performing any act that may lead to early termination of the Contract. Given that Claimant has proven an appearance of good right, Article 47 of the Convention empowers the Arbitral Tribunal to order any Provisional Measures required to protect such right. Accordingly, the Tribunal thus rejects Respondents\u2019 Request that the Provisional Measures be revoked on these grounds.\n\n*(iii) The Effects of a Law Enacted by the Congress of Ecuador cannot be Stayed*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThird, Respondents argue that Law No. 2006-42 imposes a duty on Claimant to make additional payments, which duty arises from the Law rather than from the Contract (pursuant to Section 1480 of the Civil Code.)16 No Judicial Court\u2014and especially not an Arbitral Tribunal\u2014may stay the effects of a law enacted by the Congress of Ecuador.\n\nSection 1480 of the Civil Code: \"Duties are created by an actual meeting of the minds of two people or more, such as a contract or agreement; by a voluntary act on the part of the party liable, such as upon acceptance of an inheritance or legacy and almost any unilateral act; or by an event that causes harm or damage to another person, as is the case with crimes and torts; and may arise from the law or from the family tie between parents and children.\"\n\n56.\n\nIn their Request for Revocation, Respondents cite17 paragraph 43 of the Decision on Provisional Measures, where the Tribunal stated as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal is very much aware that the Law was passed by the Legislative Branch of the State of Ecuador in exercise of its legitimate and undisputed national sovereignty and that, later on, the Ecuadorian Constitutional Tribunal issued the Resolution of August 22, 2006, declaring that such enactment does not entail a violation of the Constitution. It is the duty and right of the branches of the Ecuadorian government to enact such laws as they may deem appropriate in furtherance of common good for Ecuador, and the Tribunal cannot and does not wish to interfere in such lawmaking task. The Tribunal\u2019s role in this case is limited to disposing of any disputes arising in connection with the Contract.\"\n\n*See* \u00b6 36.\n\n57.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal assertively ratifies the conclusion above. An arbitrator lacks any power whatsoever to impair Ecuador\u2019s law-making rights or to overturn the laws enacted by the Congress of Ecuador, and the Tribunal has never intended to do so\u2014let alone order such a thing. As clearly stated in paragraph 43, *in fine,* of its Decision,18 \"[t]he Tribunal\u2019s role in this case is limited to disposing of any disputes arising in connection with the Contract.\" And this is precisely the case: the Provisional Measures ordered by the Arbitral Tribunal are not directed to stay the effects of a law enacted by the legislative branch of Ecuador, but any compulsory or coercive measure or act on the part of Petroecuador or Ecuador interfering with duties arising from the Contract, including Claimant\u2019s right to demand performance thereof.\n\nPhrase immediately following the text cited by Respondents.\n\n58.\n\nCity Oriente has a right that the *status quo ante* be maintained for as long as these arbitration proceedings are pending, and that the Contract continues to be regularly performed as agreed by the parties (as expressly required by Clause 20.3.5 of the Contract) and it also has a right that Petroecuador and Ecuador refrain from adopting any unilateral compulsory or coercive measure impairing contractual balance. The Arbitral Tribunal wishes to reiterate that its decision to preserve the *status quo* does not imply any judgment as to which position will prevail in the final award. If Respondents\u2019 position finally prevails and it is determined that the Law effectively imposes additional duties on City Oriente, the Tribunal may then issue an award ordering payment of any amounts accrued during these proceedings.\n\n59.\n\nIn the meantime, given that there is a right that the *status quo ante* be maintained, Article 47 of the Convention provides authorization to the Arbitral Tribunal to order any Provisional Measures required for the protection of such right. Thus, the Tribunal dismisses Respondents\u2019 Request that the Provisional Measures be revoked on these grounds.\n\n*(iv) The Principle of Non-aggravation of the Dispute does not* Ipso Jure *Warrant the Passing of Provisional Measures*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nFinally, Ecuador and Petroecuador point out that there is no general, autonomous, abstract right to the non-aggravation of the dispute warranting, *ipso jure,* the passing of provisional measures. Where there is no substantive right requiring protection, the principle of non-aggravation does not justify the adoption of provisional measures. Moreover, given that Claimant would only be entitled to damages, the aggravation of such damages does not constitute grounds for ordering provisional measures.\n\n61.\n\nWith all due respect, the Arbitral Tribunal does not agree with Respondents\u2019 argumentation.\n\n62.\n\n(a) First, the Tribunal disagrees because it has concluded, *prima facie,* that under Ecuadorian law the concessionaire has a right to demand contract performance upon default by the State; and this is precisely what City Oriente is seeking through these arbitration proceedings. Without the Provisional Measures, Respondents may coercively collect amounts that were not required under the Contract, or even declare the expiration of the Contract. That would not result in the aggravation of the dispute, but it would put an end to Claimant\u2019s right to demand performance of the Contract, and any potential award in its favor would be thus impossible to enforce and illusory.\n\n63.\n\n(b) Second, the Arbitral Tribunal agrees with Respondents\u2019 argument to the effect that any increase in potential damages does not generally constitute basis for ordering provisional measures.19 That having been said, the Tribunal disagrees with Respondents in that City Oriente\u2019s sole remedy would be damages.\n\nThe Decision on Provisional Measures in the Occidental Petroleum case, cited in note 8 *supra* cites that principle in \u00b6 97: \"Provisional measures are not designed to merely mitigate the final amount of damages. Indeed, if they were so intended, provisional measures would be available to claimant in almost every case.\"\n\n64.\n\nFaced with the alleged default by the other party, City Oriente could have demanded enforcement of the implied termination provision established in Section 1505 of the Civil Code, and then seek a ratification of the termination of the contract, plus any applicable damages, by way of arbitration. In that case, Respondents would have been right: Claimant would, at best, have a right to restitution and damages, and the Tribunal would have applied the principle that a possible aggravation of a debt does not generally warrant the ordering of provisional measures.\n\n65.\n\nHowever, in effect, City Oriente did not choose termination, but the other alternative available under the Civil Code: it chose an action for performance; it requested that the other party be ordered to perform its contractual duties. It is precisely in this kind of action that provisional measures play their most important role, for they prevent one party from performing any unilateral act that may affect the *status quo ante* in its own benefit, or that may turn it impossible to perform a hypothetical future award.\n\n66.\n\nThus, since there is appearance of a good right, the protection of which is sought by this arbitration, Article 47 of the Convention provides authorization to the Arbitral Tribunal to order any Provisional Measures required to protect such right. Thus, the Tribunal dismisses Respondents\u2019 Request that the Provisional Measures be revoked on these grounds.\n\n**3. The Provisional Measures are Not Necessary to Prevent Irreparable Harm**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe first argument raised by Respondents, which the Arbitral Tribunal analyzed in the chapter above, was based on the allegation that Claimants did not have any right requiring protection. The second argument was based on the fact that Provisional Measures may only be granted to prevent irreparable harm, while Ecuador and Petroecuador argue that there is no such possibility in the case under analysis.\n\n*(i) Arguments o f the Parties*\n-------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nRespondents\u2019 arguments may be summarized as follows: the Provisional Measures ordered pursuant to Article 47 of the Convention and Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules are only justified in cases of urgency and to prevent irreparable harm. Conversely, requests for measures must be rejected when the alleged breach may be compensated through the payment of damages. Moreover, Respondents argue that City Oriente is not entitled to demand performance, and that the sole remedy available to it is a claim for damages. Law No. 2006-42 imposes a duty to pay an amount of money. Any alleged breach of the Contract due to non-payment of such amount would result in a new debt.\n\n69.\n\nIn response to these allegations made by Respondents, City Oriente has argued that neither Article 47 of the Convention nor Rule 39 of the Rules contain a requirement that the provisional measures be ordered to prevent irreparable harm; and that that requirement is thus inapplicable. City Oriente adds that, even if there were such a requirement, it is met in this case, because if it were to make the additional payments required under the new law, City Oriente would be forced out of business, incurring losses of almost USD 23 for every barrel of produced oil.\n\n*(ii)* *Analysis of the Arbitral Tribunal*\n------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal has verified that neither Article 47 of the Convention nor Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules require that provisional measures be ordered only as a means to prevent irreparable harm. The only requirement arising from the wording of Rule 39 is the traditional urgency requirement; this requirement was analyzed by the Arbitral Tribunal in paragraphs 67 *et seq.* of the Decision dated November 19, 2007, and the Tribunal concluded that it has effectively been fulfilled.\n\n71.\n\nIn the cited Decision, the Tribunal concluded that the urgency requirement had been met because it deemed that \"the passing of the provisional measures is indeed urgent, precisely to keep the enforced collection or termination proceedings from being started, as this operates as a pressuring mechanism, aggravates and extends the dispute and, by itself, impairs the rights which Claimant seeks to protect through this arbitration.\"20 If anything, fulfillment of that requirement is even firmer now, since the expiration proceedings are progressing and Petroecuador has continued to serve demands for payment.\n\nCf. Decision on Provisional Measures dated November 19, 2007, \u00b6 69.\n\n72.\n\nNow, is there a second requirement to be fulfilled stating that provisional measures must be necessary to prevent irreparable harm? Rule 39 only refers to \"circumstances that require such measures\". It is the opinion of the Tribunal that this wording requires only that provisional measures must not be ordered lightly, but only as a last resort, after careful consideration of the interests at stake, weighing the harm spared the petitioner and the damage inflicted on the other party. It is not so essential that provisional measures be necessary to prevent irreparable harm, but that the harm spared the petitioner by such measures must be significant and that it exceed greatly the damage caused to the party affected thereby.21\n\nCf. Article 17 A 1 c) UNCITRAL Model Law: \"Harm not adequately reparable by an award of damages is likely to result if the measure is not ordered, and such harm substantially outweighs the harm that is likely to result to the party against whom the measure is directed if the measure is granted.\"  \nThe Arbitral Tribunal in the *Occidental Petroleum* Case seems to have based its decision on the same grounds (note 8 *supra),* \u00b6 93: \"...the Tribunal notes that provisional measures may not be awarded for the protection of the rights of one party where such provisional measures would cause irreparable harm to the rights of the other party.\"\n\n73.\n\nIn ordering the provisional measures when it did and in upholding them in this decision, the Tribunal has always attempted to so weigh the interests at stake.22\n\nAlso, cf. \u00b6 54 *supra.*\n\n74.\n\nWe must remember the basis of the proceedings: the main relief sought by Claimant is the performance of the Contract, and after careful consideration of the allegations presented by the parties so far, the Arbitral Tribunal *prima facie* considers that this claim is admissible under Ecuadorian Law. In response to this petition, Respondents proceeded as follows:\n\n- Petroecuador has repeatedly claimed that City Oriente make an additional payment not originally required under the Contract for an amount in excess of USD 37 million; City Oriente\u2019s returns for 2007 amounted to USD 16,971,089;23\n\n- Petroecuador and Ecuador have commenced an administrative proceedings which could result in an expiration order carrying the termination of the Contract;\n\n- The Ecuadorian Prosecutor and the State General Attorney\u2019s Office brought criminal charges against Messrs. Ford, Y\u00e9pez and P\u00e1ez, executives of City Oriente, on alleged charges of embezzlement due\u2014precisely\u2014to the failure to pay the additional amounts owed by Claimant as a result of the application of the newly enacted law;\n\nTable prepared by Mr. Esteban P\u00f3lit, Administrative Financial Manager of City Oriente, presented at the Hearing and updated in \u00b6\u00b6 159 *et seq.* of the Reply to the Request.\n\n75.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, to adequately weigh the interests at stake, the Tribunal must analyze two potential scenarios where the interests of the parties would be affected: (a) first, the Tribunal resolves to revoke the Provisional Measures and the final award on the Merits is favorable to City Oriente; (b) second, the Tribunal resolves to maintain the Provisional Measures and Respondents\u2019 position prevails in the merits stage.\n\n76.\n\n(a) In the first case, if the Provisional Measures are revoked, the expiration proceedings would go on with a high risk that the Contract may be finally terminated by an administrative declaration unilaterally adopted by the State. Moreover, Petroecuador would become entitled forthwith to demand that City Oriente pay an amount of money not originally required under the Contract that doubles the total return earned in FY 2007. In this case, if these proceedings result in a final award granting the relief sought by Claimant, the decision would be impossible to perform, for the Contract would have already been terminated. Besides, the amounts claimed by Respondents are so high that there is a risk that the early payment of such amounts may j eopardize the company's economic feasibility.\n\n77.\n\n(b) In the second case, where the Provisional Measures are maintained and the final award favors Respondents, Petroecuador would be entitled to demand payment of the additional amounts owed under Law No. 2006-42, plus applicable interest and the State would then be authorized to resume the expiration proceedings stayed by order of this Tribunal. The damage suffered due to the delay in payment would be compensated by payment of interest, City Oriente's creditworthiness would remain unaffected because its investments, concessions, and assets located on Ecuadorian territory would continue to exist, thus guaranteeing enforcement of the final award, and the expiration proceedings could advance regularly (and would only have been delayed.)\n\n78.\n\nIn this state of affairs, the Arbitral Tribunal's sole remedy is to ratify the Provisional Measures previously ordered, for having weighed the interests at stake, it is the opinion of this Tribunal that such measures prevent serious\u2014 and even irreparable\u2014damage to the petitioner at the cost of lesser and reparable damage caused to Respondents.\n\n*(iii) Precedents Cited*\n------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThis decision having been made, the Tribunal must now cite certain awards and decisions entered in other cases concerning similar facts, cited by Respondents in their submission.\n\n80.\n\nThe first decision mentioned is Procedural Order No. 3 issued in the ICSID arbitration in *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine.**24* This case was an investment case where Claimant demanded compensation for a violation of the Lithuania-Ukraine BIT. Following a first request for provisional measures granted by the tribunal, Claimant requested that the tribunal issue a new order staying a criminal proceeding against an executive commenced before the request for arbitration, revoking the seizure of certain assets and suspending an investigation carried out by the District Attorney. The tribunal rejected this request, arguing that for a provisional measure to be granted under Article 47 of the Convention, it must be necessary and urgent. And it is only considered necessary if \"there is a threat or possibility of irreparable harm to the rights invoked.\"25 Upon analyzing the facts of the case, the *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* tribunal found that the second provisional measures requested failed to fulfill the above requirements.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Procedural Order No. 3 dated January 18, 2005.\n\n\u00b6 8, citing as precedent the Dissenting Opinion of Jim\u00e9nez de Ar\u00e9chaga in the case *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf of* the International Court of Justice of 1976.\n\n81.\n\nThe decision is irrelevant for the purposes of this arbitration.\n\n82.\n\nFirst, it appears to be an isolated decision, and no other case has been cited where an ICSID Arbitral Tribunal has embraced the interpretation of Article 47 of the Convention proposed in Procedural Order No. 3 of the *Tokio Tokel\u00e9s* case.\n\n83.\n\nSecond, the *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* Tribunal itself had previously granted in OP. Number l26 a first request for provisional measures filed by Claimant, and in that Procedural Order No. 1, the tribunal made no reference whatsoever to any hypothetical requirement of irreparable harm and ordered the stay of any judicial procedure liable to affect the final award or aggravate the existing dispute.\n\nNot cited by Respondents, dated July 1, 2003; between Procedural Order Number 1 and Procedural Order Number 3 the President was replaced\n\n84.\n\nMoreover, in the *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* decision, the Tribunal cited the ICJ decision in the *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf* case, in 1976, of doubtful application to this arbitration due to the factual and legal background of such case, the deciding body and the date, very remote.\n\n85.\n\nRegardless of the weight that may be given to the decision adopted in Procedural Order No. 3 in the *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* case from a strictly legal standpoint, it is still irrelevant for the purposes of this arbitration for reasons that are purely factual; if the Provisional Measures are not maintained, the damage sustained by Claimant could be irreparable, and the performance of the award would become illusory. Since the requirement established in the *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* case has been met in this case, there is no need for the Tribunal to analyze whether there is such a legal requirement.\n\n86.\n\nRespondents also cite decisions entered in *Occidental Petroleum27* and *Plama28* ICSID cases in support of their argument that mere monetary damages do not constitute irreparable harm. Once again, there is no need for the Arbitral Tribunal to render an opinion on these decisions, because both cases present a material difference with the case under analysis: these are investment arbitrations, where the sole relief sought by Claimants is damages. The facts of this case are completely different, because what City Oriente seeks through this arbitration is contractual performance. The conclusions in *Occidental Petroleum* and *Plama* are completely immaterial for the purposes of this decision.\n\nCf. Note 8, *supra*\n\n*Plama Consortium Limited c. Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Decision of September 6, 2005.\n\n87.\n\nAll in all, the precedents cited by Respondents do not affect the conclusions reached by this Tribunal.\n\n**4. The Decision on Provisional Measures Rules Fully on the Request for Arbitration**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe third and last argument raised by Respondents to object to the Provisional Measures is that a complaint cannot be settled on a provisional basis. Any request for provisional measures seeking early recognition and ratification of the same rights constituting the merits of the case must necessarily be rejected. In the opinion of Ecuador and Petroecuador, since the Provisional Measures were ordered Claimant would be trying this case with the benefit of an anticipated victory. The Measures would imply an undue interference with the exercise of the powers of a Sovereign State on its natural resources, and would cause Ecuador to sustain irreparable harm in violation of Article 47 of the Convention, which forces the Arbitral Tribunal to preserve \"the respective rights of either party.\"\n\n89.\n\nWith all due respect, the Arbitral Tribunal disagrees with the arguments presented by Respondents.\n\n90.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal would like to state once again29 its respect for the sovereign powers of the Republic of Ecuador and the right to dispose of its natural resources pursuant to any laws deemed appropriate by the branches of government of Ecuador. The Provisional Measures do not interfere with the exercise of those powers. Conversely, their sole effect is to order that natural resources be exploited pursuant to a Contract executed by Ecuador's Branches of Government, considering it a valid and effective tool to regulate its natural resources for as long as a decision is pending on the impact of a new law. If Respondents consider that City Oriente owes them certain amounts, this arbitration is the perfect forum to make such claim.\n\nAs previously established in \u00b6 43 of the Decision dated November 19, 2007.\n\n91.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal wishes to remind the parties that the Provisional Measures do not entail a prejudgment on the merits, and do not at all constitute an \"anticipated victory\" on the part of Claimant, as alleged by Respondents.\n\n92.\n\nThird, the Provisional Measures ordered by Tribunal do not entail any ruling on the Request for Arbitration. City Oriente, Ecuador and Petroecuador entered into a Contract and performed it regularly as agreed by the parties. Following the enactment of Law No. 2006-42, Petroecuador sought to collect certain additional amounts not required under the original Contract. Faced with these attempts, City Oriente decided to file this request for arbitration and demand performance of the contract plus any applicable damages. The sole purpose of the Provisional Measures is to maintain the *status quo ante* while a decision is pending on this proceeding and while the Tribunal determines who is right under Ecuadorian Law, chosen by mutual agreement of the parties as applicable laws.\n\n93.\n\nThe Provisional Measures in no way grant the demand for Contract performance which constitutes the claim of City Oriente in this arbitration. In fact, the granting of such demand would translate into an award ordering that the Contract must continue to be performed pursuant to its original terms notwithstanding the enactment of Law No. 2006-42. The Provisional Measures lack that scope; they are not based on the analysis of the impact of Law No. 2006-42 on the duties of the parties; they merely establish that, provisionally, pending a decision on this proceeding, Claimants must refrain from aggravating the dispute or unilaterally modifying the *status quo ante,* which\u2014it must be reiterated\u2014is the one resulting from the terms and conditions freely established by the parties.\n\n94.\n\nFinally, for the reasons explained in the chapter above, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that the maintenance of the Provisional Measures does not cause irreparable harm to Respondents, while their revocation may cause such harm to City Oriente.\n\n95.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal thus resolves to reject Respondents\u2019 Request that the Provisional Measures be revoked on these grounds.\n\n96.\n\nTo sum up, having analyzed the different arguments presented by Respondents in support of their request for revocation of the Provisional Measures, the Arbitral Tribunal has come to the conclusion that as of today, and based on the legal and factual arguments presented by the parties, the request previously mentioned must be rejected. The decisions on Provisional Measures do not constitute *res judicata,* so that the Provisional Measures ratified hereby may be amended, expanded or revoked at the request of either party at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n**III. Regime of Fees and Expenses of the Members of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThrough the communication dated February 21, 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal asked the parties to make simultaneous submissions containing their argumentation related to the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal by March 3, 2008, and both parties complied with such request.\n\n98.\n\nThe regime of fees and expenses of the Tribunal is regulated in Clause 20.3.7 of the Contract, which provides as follows:\n\n\"The expenses incurred in this arbitration shall be borne by the Party ordered to pay by the arbitration commission in its decision; the foregoing notwithstanding, each Party shall pay the fees of the arbitrator designated by it or by the one appointed at its direction, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration. The fees of the chairman of the arbitration commission shall be divided equally between the parties and paid by them. Any anticipated expenses required to be incurred during the arbitration proceedings shall be paid on a provisional basis by the Party that requested the arbitration.\"30\n\nCf. Contract, Clause 20.3.7.\n\n99.\n\nRegulation 14(3)(d) of ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, in turn, sets forth the following rule concerning the advance payments the parties are required to make during the proceedings:\n\n\"(3) In order to enable the Centre to make the payments provided for in paragraph (2), as well as to incur other direct expenses in connection with a proceeding (other than expenses covered by Regulation 15):\n\n(d) in connection with every conciliation proceeding, and in connection with every arbitration proceeding unless a different division is provided for in the Arbitration Rules or is decided by the parties or the Tribunal, each party shall pay one half of each advance or supplemental charge, without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of an arbitration proceeding to be made by the Tribunal pursuant to Article 61(2) of the Convention.\n\n100.\n\nClaimant suggests a narrow interpretation of Clause 20.3.7 of the Contract. This clause refers to any \"anticipated expenses required to be incurred during the arbitration\" and provides that such expenses shall be borne fully by claimant. In the opinion of City Oriente, this type of expenses regulated in the arbitration clause would only include the expenses effectively incurred in connection with the procedures, but would not include the fees paid to the ICSID or the expenses incurred by the arbitrators, which expenses must be borne equally by both parties.\n\n101.\n\nClaimant then argues that Regulations 14(3)(a), (c) and (d) of the Regulations make a distinction between two different types of expenses: initial expenses, which are required by the Secretary-General at the commencement of the proceeding, and supplementary anticipated expenses, required when the former have been exhausted. In Claimant\u2019s opinion, the \"anticipated expenses incurred during the arbitration\" referenced in Clause 20.3.7 of the Contract would only cover the former. These should be contributed in full by Claimant, while supplementary expenses should be borne pursuant to the general principle established in Regulation 14(3)(d), that is, equally by both parties.\n\n102.\n\nIn turn, Respondents do not agree with City Oriente on the scope of the meaning of the phrase \"advance expenses incurred during the arbitration\" established in Clause 20.3.7 of the Contract. In Respondents\u2019 opinion, these expenses would cover all the expenses resulting from the procedure, without limitation (expenses and fees of the Arbitral Tribunal, ICSID fees, expert fees and witnesses, hearing expenses) and without any distinction on whether they are initial or supplementary. All of these expenses must be paid fully by Claimant.\n\n103.\n\nRespondents further argue that they have already made an advance payment in the amount of USD 100,000. They request that that amount be allocated to the fees and expenses of arbitrator Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C., appointed by Respondents, and to 50% of the fees of the Chairman, but that it not be applied to support any other expenses. This allocation would be appropriate because Clause 20.3.7 of the Contract sets forth that each party shall be liable for payment of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator appointed by such party, as well as for 50% of the fees of the Chairman of the Tribunal.\n\n104.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that any analysis must start with an examination of the Centre's Administrative and Financial Regulations adopted by the parties under the arbitration clause included in the Contract. Regulation 14(3)(d) provides that, as a general rule, both initial and supplementary expenses must be borne equally by both parties. However, the rule also authorizes the parties to modify the expense distribution scheme, and this is precisely what happened in this case. Under Clause 20.3.7. of the Contract, the parties agreed that \"any anticipated expenses required to be incurred during the arbitration proceedings shall be paid on a provisional basis by the Party that requested the arbitration.\" It is thus clear that the parties intended to exclude the solution established by Regulation 14(3)(d) of the ICSID Regulations and replace it with the new rule set forth in Clause 20.3.7 of the Contract.\n\n105.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason warranting such a narrow interpretation of the contract clause, limiting its scope of application. The parties agreed to establish a regime to fund advance expenses different from the one provided by the Regulations. Given such intention, there is no indication that the parties intended that that special regime would apply only to certain advance expenses to the exclusion of others. Pursuant to Section 1603 of the Civil Code, \"if the intent of the parties to the contract is sufficiently clear, such intention shall prevail over the literal wording.\" Thus, the reference to \"anticipated expenses\" contained in Clause 20.3.7 of the Contract must be understood to include all the expenses covered by Regulation 14(3) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, regardless of whether they are labeled as anticipated expenses, supplementary payments or additional advance payments.\n\n106.\n\nThat having been said, the Tribunal concludes that, pursuant to the express agreement between the parties, Claimant shall pay all anticipated expenses, whether initial or supplementary, required during the arbitration proceeding.\n\n107.\n\nThis decision shall only apply to anticipated expenses. The final allocation of arbitration costs and expenses shall be ordered in the final award, pursuant to the provisions set out in Clause 20.3.7 of the Contract, the Convention, the Arbitration Rules and the Regulations. At that time, the Arbitral Tribunal shall also decide the allocation of advance payments already made by Respondents. In the meantime, these payments shall be allocated, as required by Respondents,31 to the payment of fees and expenses of the arbitrator appointed by Respondents and 50% of the fees of the Chairman.\n\nSubmission dated March 3,2008, at 2.\n\n**IV. Place of the Proceedings**\n--------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nLike it did in connection with the regime applicable to fees and expenses, through communication dated February 21, 2008, the Arbitral Tribunal invited the parties to file simultaneous submissions in connection with the place of the arbitration proceedings by March 3, 2008, and both parties filed their submissions within the stated term.\n\n109.\n\nThe place of the proceedings is governed both by Clause 20.3.3 of the Contract and by Regulation 26 of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, by Rule 13(3) of the Arbitration Rules and by Article 63(b) of the Convention.\n\nClause 20.3.3 of the Contracts provides as follows:\n\n\"The arbitrage will be installed and performed in the city of Quito notwithstanding the arbitration committee\u2019s right to move wherever is necessary to perform its duties.\"\n\nIn turn, Regulation 26 provides as follows:\n\n\"Place of Proceedings\n\n(1) The Secretary-General shall make arrangements for the holding of conciliation and arbitration proceedings at the seat of the Centre or shall, at the request of the parties and as provided in Article 63 of the Convention, make or supervise arrangements if proceedings are held elsewhere.\n\n(2) The Secretary-General shall assist a Commission or Tribunal, at its request, in visiting any place connected with a dispute or in conducting inquiries there.\"\n\nIn turn, Rule 13(3) of the Arbitration Rules provides as follows:\n\n\"Sessions of the Tribunal\n\n(3) The Tribunal shall meet at the seat of the Centre or at such other place as may have been agreed by the parties in accordance with Article 63 of the Convention. If the parties agree that the proceeding shall be held at a place other than the Centre or an institution with which the Centre has made the necessary arrangements, they shall consult with the Secretary-General and request the approval of the Tribunal. Failing such approval, the Tribunal shall meet at the seat of the Centre.\"\n\nFinally, Article 63 of the Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"Conciliation and arbitration proceedings may be held, if the parties so agree, (a) at the seat of the Permanent Court of Arbitration or of any other appropriate institution, whether private or public, with which the Centre may make arrangements for that purpose; or (b) at any other place approved by the Commission or Tribunal after consultation with the Secretary-General.\"\n\n110.\n\nClaimant alleges that under Clause 20.3.3 of the Contract, the parties established Quito exclusively as \"the place of preference for the proceeding to take place\", leaving it at the discretion of the Arbitral Tribunal to decide on the final place for the proceedings. In this line of reasoning, Claimant considers that this is the reason for the inclusion of the wording stating \"notwithstanding the arbitration committee\u2019s right to move wherever is necessary to perform its duties.\"\n\n111.\n\nClaimant does not object to the designation of Quito as place of the proceedings; it points out, however, that Quito may lack the minimum safety conditions to protect the attendants to a hearing, and that the regular course of the proceedings may be affected by potential social and media pressure due to the strong political essence of the arbitration.\n\n112.\n\nIn turn, Respondents believe that, since the Contract contains a clause that expressly establishes that the proceeding is to be held in Quito, this implies that the parties have exercised the right conferred by Regulation 26 of the Regulations, Rule 13 of the Arbitration Rules and Article 63 of the Convention. Respondents further argue that there is no obstacle preventing the parties from establishing the territory of the Respondent State as place of the proceeding in exercise of such power, and cite Professor Shreuer in support of such argument: \"But there are also clauses in contracts providing that ICSID arbitration proceedings are to be held in the host state. This was the case in Mobil Oil v. New Zealand. In that case the majority of the Tribunal\u2019s sessions were held in Auckland, New Zealand.\"32\n\nCf. Respondents\u2019 Letter dated February 19, 2008, page 2.\n\n113.\n\nIn line of the foregoing, Respondents request the Arbitral Tribunal to consult with the Secretary-General of the ICSID regarding the possibility of designating Quito as place of the proceedings, pursuant to Article 63 of the Convention, to guarantee the application in Quito of the immunity regime all ICSID arbitrations are subject to, which request had already been communicated by Respondents to the Arbitral Tribunal in writing on February 19, 2008. They further argue that there should be no problem hindering the designation of Quito as place of the proceedings, since similar ICSID arbitrations have previously been carried out with seat in Ecuador33.\n\nFor example, they cite *Repsol YPF Ecuador* SL4. v. *Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10) among others, Cf. Respondents\u2019 Letter dated March 3, 2008.\n\n114.\n\nIn light of the arguments presented by the parties, the Arbitral Tribunal now considers that its decision on this procedural aspect calls for a definition of the scope of Clause 20.3.3 and a clarification of ICSID general rules.\n\n115.\n\nICSID rules establish that the place of the arbitration proceedings must be determined pursuant to the following order:\n\n- Preferably, the place of the arbitration proceedings shall be the seat of the Centre (Article 62 of the Convention);\n\n- Without prejudice to this general principle, the parties have the right to agree that the proceeding be held in a different place, which may be the seat of the Permanent Court of Arbitration or of any other appropriate institution, whether private or public, with which the Centre may make arrangements for that purpose;34 (Article 63(a) of the Convention); and\n\n- Additionally, the parties may establish any other place for the proceedings, provided that such decision must be subject to the approval of the Arbitral Tribunal after consultation of the Secretary-General (Article 63(b) of the Convention).\n\nThe Centre has agreements of this kind with Cairo, Kuala Lumpur, Melbourne, Singapore and Sidney, but not with Quito.\n\n116.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal understands that when the parties exercised the right conferred upon them by ICSID regulations and established, in the contract, that \"The arbitrage will be installed and performed in the city of Quito,\" they intended to establish that Quito was to be the place of the proceedings, in the terms of ICSID regulations. This fulfills the requirement established in Article 63 of the Convention, first paragraph, which requires the agreement of the parties to choose a place for the proceeding other than the seat of the Centre (\"if the parties so agree\"). There is no obstacle preventing that such consent be given in advance, in a contract clause.35\n\nIn the same regard, see Schreuer, *op. cit.* note 4, at 1252.\n\n117.\n\nThe second requirement established in Article 63 of the Convention is yet to be fulfilled. Given that there is no ICSID office in Quito and that the Centre has not entered into any agreement with any public or private Ecuadorian institution, it is not possible to apply paragraph (a) in this case. Under paragraph (b) the proceeding may be performed in any other place, provided two conditions are fulfilled: (i) a consultation with the Secretary-General; and (ii) approval by the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n118.\n\nThe consultation to the Secretary-General and the approval of the Tribunal are required on a case-by-case basis, every time a hearing must be held and attended by the parties, because it is possible for the same arbitration proceeding to develop in different places.36 At present, the procedural calendar is incomplete: the parties have only agreed on the exchange of Memorial, Counter-Memorial, Reply and Rejoinder\u2014which process will only be completed on November 11, 2008. There is no specific provision regarding the celebration and agenda of the next hearing.\n\nCf. Schreuer, *op. cit.* note 4, at 1247.\n\n119.\n\nThe Arbitration Tribunal thus requests both parties to state, in their Reply and Rejoinder, respectively (i) whether they deem it necessary to hold a hearing; (ii) if they so deem it, to propose the general structure for development and list the people that must be called to such hearing; (iii) to state the place where the hearing is to be held, in their opinion.\n\n120.\n\nIf Claimant, in the Reply, or Respondents, in the Rejoinder, should request that the hearing be held in Quito, the Arbitration Tribunal would proceed forthwith to consult the Secretary-General to make a decision pursuant to Rule 13(3) of the Arbitration Rules."}]}
