PRELIMINARY MATTERS**\n--------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Hungarian People's Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated 9 March 1987 (the \"**UK-Hungary BIT**\" or the \"**BIT**\" or the \"**Treaty**\")1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 and became binding on Hungary on 6 March 1987 and on the United Kingdom on 18 January 1967 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\nUK-Hungary BIT, CL-1.\n\n**A. THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants (together referred to as the \"**Claimants**\") are:\n\n(i) Magyar Farming Company Ltd (\"**Magyar**\"), a company incorporated and existing under the laws of the United Kingdom (the \"**UK**\");2\n\n(ii) Kintyre Kft (\"**Kintyre**\"), a company incorporated and existing under the laws of Hungary;3 and\n\n(iii) In\u00edcia Zrt. (\"**In\u00edcia**\"), a company incorporated and existing under the laws of Hungary.4\n\nCertificate of Incorporation of Magyar Farming Company Limited, 15 October 1997, C-26.\n\nExtract from Kintyre Kft's shareholder register, 17 March 2017, C-1.\n\nExtract from In\u00edcia Zrt's shareholder register, 17 March 2017, C-2.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is Hungary (\"**Hungary**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"), a sovereign State and a member of the European Union as well as a contracting State to the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**\". The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**B. THE DISPUTE**\n------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute arises out of Hungary's measures regulating possession and disposal of State- owned agricultural land, which, according to the Claimants, resulted in the expropriation of their leasehold rights to 760 hectares of State-owned land located in Hungary's NorthWestern region of Ikr\u00e9ny (the \"**Land**\") and in a diminution of the value of their farming business in Hungary (the \"**Farm**\").\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, pursuant to the lease agreement between In\u00edcia and Hungary's State-owned asset management agency, concluded on 25 July 19945 and amended and extended in 19996 and 20067 (the \"**Lease Agreement**\" or the \"**Lease**\"), In\u00edcia had a contractual and a statutory pre-lease right to the Land. For the Claimants, this entailed that, if Hungary intended to lease the Land to a third party upon the expiration of the Lease Agreement (in July 2014), it should inform In\u00edcia of any offer from a third party that it intended to accept. The pre-lease right, so say the Claimants, then entitled In\u00edcia to \"step in and assume the offer from the third party\" and thereby enter into a renewed lease agreement upon the terms of that offer.8\n\nLease Agreement of 25 July 1994 between the State Property Agency and In\u00edcia Zrt (the \"1994 Lease Agreement\"), C-33.\n\nLease Agreement of 1 November 1999 between State Privatisation and Property Plc and In\u00edcia Zrt (the \"1999 Lease Agreement\"), C-38.\n\nLease Agreement of 16 November 2006 between National Land Fund Management Organisation and In\u00edcia Zrt (the \"2006 Lease Agreement\"), C-40.\n\nCM, \u00b6 123.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, in 2011, the Parliament passed an amendment to the land law,9 which precluded lessees of State-owned agricultural land plots from exercising their statutory pre-lease rights in cases where the National Land Agency (the \"**NLA**\") leased the land out by way of a tender. According to the Claimants, the Respondent then \"orchestrated a rigged tender process whereby, despite the Respondent's prior assurances and despite the Claimants' superior bids, the leases were \u2018won' by third parties in January 2014.\"10 As a result, according to the Claimants, security guards acting under the direction of the Respondent, evicted them from the Land in blatant disregard of their pre-lease rights and the interim possessory protection that In\u00edcia had obtained from the local authorities.\n\nAct No. LXXXVII of 2010 on the National Land Fund, C-43.\n\nCM, \u00b6 235.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent's measures constitute an unlawful expropriation of the Claimants' leasehold rights to the Land contrary to Article 6 of the BIT and request the Tribunal to award full compensation of damages resulting from the Respondent's wrongful conduct.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent fully rejects these claims. As a preliminary matter, it submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to resolve the dispute, since the dispute resolution provision of the BIT is inapplicable due to Hungary's accession to the European Union in 2004, and in any event, because the Claimants' alleged rights in relation to which the dispute arises either expired on their own terms or do not constitute an investment for the purposes of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n10.\n\nOn the merits, the Respondent submits that the Claimants held no rights capable of being expropriated at the time of the disputed measures, and in any event, the measures did not constitute a sovereign interference or a taking of the purported pre-lease rights. The Respondent also rejects having expropriated the Claimants' investment as a whole, as the Claimants still continue their farming activity in Hungary at profit.\n\n11.\n\nThe Respondent further opposes the Claimants' quantification of the alleged loss as grossly overstated. It submits that any award for damages should be limited to the fair market value of the allegedly expropriated asset and not extend to remote consequential losses as the Claimants claim. In addition, according to the Respondent, the Claimants failed to mitigate their loss, which should result in a further reduction of the claimed compensation. Considering these factors, the Respondent offers an alternative valuation of the Claimants' alleged loss.\n\n**C. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n--------------------------\n\n12.\n\nThe Claimants formulated their request for relief in the Reply11 as follows:\n\n[T]he Claimants respectfully invite the Tribunal to render a Final Award:\n\na. Declaring that the Respondent has breached the BIT by expropriating the Claimants' investment without complying with the requirements of Article 6 of the BIT, including payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation;\n\nb. Ordering the Respondent to pay to the Claimants damages representing full reparation for losses sustained as a result of the expropriation in the sum of \u20ac17.9m, plus the costs and expenses of these arbitration proceedings (including lawyers' and experts' fees and expenses, and the fees and expenses of ICSID and the Tribunal), and the costs and expenses of the local court proceedings in Hungary (in the sum of HUF 57,222,236), together with interest compounded semi-annually at the rate of 7.87% until the date of payment;\n\nc. Alternatively, as regards costs and expenses, ordering the Respondent to pay to the Claimants, as costs, all the costs and expenses of these arbitration proceedings (including lawyers' and experts' fees and expenses, and the fees and expenses of ICSID and the Tribunal), as well as the costs and expenses of the local court proceedings in Hungary (HUF 57,222,236), together with interest compounded semi-annually at the rate of 7.87% until the date of payment.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 372.\n\n13.\n\nThe Respondent formulated its request for relief in the Rejoinder12 as follows:\n\nRespondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to:\n\n- Declare that it does not have jurisdiction over Claimants' claims;\n\n- To the extent it decides it has jurisdiction over Claimants' claims, dismiss all of Claimants' claims under Article 6(1) of the BIT;\n\n- To the extent it declares Respondent to be responsible for a violation of Article 6(1) of the BIT,\n\no declare that Claimants failed to mitigate their losses and therefore determine that the amount payable by Respondent as compensation cannot exceed EUR 930,000; or\n\no if it determines that Claimants did not fail to mitigate their losses, determine the compensation payable by Respondent in an amount not exceeding the fair market value of Claimants' alleged pre-lease right.\n\n- Order Claimants to pay Respondent's expenses (including legal and expert fees and disbursements) and all other costs of the arbitration.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 581.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing the Hearing, in its letter of 21 June 2019, the Respondent presented an amended request for relief, which reads as follows:\n\nRespondent respectfully requests the Tribunal to:\n\n- Declare that it does not have jurisdiction over Claimants' claims;\n\n- To the extent it decides it has jurisdiction over Claimants' claims, dismiss all of Claimants' claims under Article 6(1) of the BIT;\n\n- To the extent it declares Respondent to be responsible for a violation of Article 6(1) of the BIT,\n\no declare that Claimants failed to mitigate their losses and therefore determine that the amount payable by Respondent as compensation cannot exceed EUR 930,000; or\n\no if it determines that Claimants did not fail to mitigate their losses, determine the compensation payable by Respondent in an amount not exceeding the fair market value of Claimants' alleged pre-lease right; or\n\no if it determines that the compensation payable by Respondent should be determined by subtracting the Actual Value of the Farm from the But For Value of the Farm:\n\n\u2022 direct Claimants to keep Respondent informed of any sale of the Farm; and\n\n\u2022 subtract from the compensation payable by Respondent all sums Claimants may receive above the Farm's Actual Value (as determined by the Tribunal) in case they sell the Farm before the Award is paid, or\n\n\u2022 order that Claimants shall pay to Respondent all sums Claimants may receive above the Farm's Actual Value (as determined by the Tribunal) in case they sell the Farm after the Award is paid.\n\n- Order Claimants to pay Respondent's expenses (including legal and expert fees and disbursements) and all other costs of the arbitration.\n\n15.\n\nThe Claimants object to the admissibility of the amendment of the Respondent's request for relief.13\n\nClaimants' email of 24 June 2019 to the Tribunal.\n\n**D. THE TRIBUNAL**\n-------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal was constituted on 4 January 2018 in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules.

Box 552  \nCH-1211 Geneva 4 Switzerland   \nTel: +41 22 809 6193\n\n19.\n\nThe functions of the Assistant are set out in the Tribunal's letter of 15 January 2018, which the Parties accepted as recorded at paragraph 8.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n**E. PLACE OF PROCEEDINGS**\n---------------------------\n\n20.\n\nPursuant to Article 62 of the ICSID Convention, the place of the proceedings is Washington, D.C. However, as confirmed in ICSID's email of 8 May 2019, the Parties agreed to conduct the Hearing at the World Bank offices in Paris, France.\n\n**F. APPLICABLE LAWS**\n----------------------\n\n**(1) Procedure**\n-----------------\n\n21.\n\nPursuant to Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, the procedure of this arbitration is governed by the following instruments and rules in the following order of precedence:\n\n\u2022 Section I of Chapter IV of the ICSID Convention;\n\n\u2022 Any rules of procedure agreed upon by the Parties; and\n\n\u2022 The ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**ICSID Rules**\").\n\n22.\n\nIf a question of procedure arises which is not covered by the instruments listed in the preceding paragraph, the Tribunal shall decide the question. Accordingly, the Tribunal has issued multiple procedural directions throughout this arbitration, including, but not limited to, Procedural Orders Nos. 1, 2 and 3.\n\n**(2) Merits**\n--------------\n\n23.\n\nPursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, when resolving the dispute, the Tribunal must primarily apply the law agreed upon by the Parties; in the absence of which, it shall apply the laws of the respondent State and international law as may be applicable:\n\nThe Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\n\n24.\n\nIt is common ground that the Parties have made no explicit choice of law. For the Claimants, however, the merits of the dispute is subject to international law, since the claims are based on the BIT, *i.e.* an international treaty.15 The Respondent in turn points to the fact that the BIT contains no choice-of-law clause and argues that the choice of international law cannot be implied from the sole fact that the claims may arise out of the BIT.16\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 24-32.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 33-44.\n\n25.\n\nICSID jurisprudence supports the approach that, when the disputing parties have made no express choice-of-law, such choice cannot be implied from the mere fact that the claims arise under an international treaty.17 For instance, according to the tribunal in *Perenco v. Ecuador*, where \"the Treaty does not contain an express applicable law clause [\u2026] the Tribunal must apply Article 42(1), second sentence, of the ICSID Convention\".18 Prominent commentators of the ICSID Convention also affirm that \"an agreement under Art. 42(1) requires an affirmative choice and should be express.\"19 In this respect, it is telling that the Claimants themselves rely on Hungarian law when addressing the issues such as the nature and the scope of their alleged leasehold rights.\n\n*Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability, 14 December 2012 (\"*Burlington v. Ecuador*\"), RL-60, \u00b6 178; *Perenco Ecuador Limited v. Republic of Ecuador and Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on the Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability, 12 September 2014 (\"*Perenco v. Ecuador*\"), RL-46, \u00b6\u00b6 532-533.\n\n*Perenco v. Ecuador*, RL-46, \u00b6\u00b6 532-533.\n\nSchreuer, Malintoppi, Reinisch and Sinclair, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 2009), RL-75, Article 42, \u00b6 76.\n\n26.\n\nTherefore, in the absence of a choice-of-law provision in the BIT, or elsewhere for that matter, the default rule of the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention applies. This provision does not allocate specific matters to either international or domestic law. Instead, it calls for the application of either of these laws \"as may be applicable\" to a particular issue in dispute. It is thus for the Tribunal to determine whether a particular issue is subject to national or international law.20 In doing so, the Tribunal will be guided primarily by the BIT.\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador*, RL-60, \u00b6 179.\n\n27.\n\nWhen applying the law, whether municipal or international, the Tribunal is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the Parties. The principle of *iura novit arbiter* allows the Tribunal to form its own opinion of the meaning of the law, provided that it does not surprise the Parties with a legal theory that was not subject to debate and that the Parties could not anticipate.21\n\n*Mr. Patrick Mitchell v.

SCOPE OF THIS AWARD**\n--------------------------\n\n28.\n\nPursuant to the Procedural Calendar established with the agreement of the Parties at the outset of the proceedings,22 the present award finally resolves the Respondent's preliminary objections as well as the issues of liability and quantum.\n\nAnnex A to Procedural Order No. 1, 14 February 2018.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n29.\n\nOn 14 July 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 4 July 2017 from the Claimants against Hungary, together with exhibits C-1 through C-25 and legal authorities CL-1 and CL-2 (the \"**Request**\").\n\n30.\n\nOn 1 August 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n31.\n\nBy emails of 5 September 2017, the Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third, the presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter of 12 September 2017, the Claimants appointed Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, as arbitrator in this case, who accepted his appointment on 13 September 2017.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of 9 October 2017, the Respondent appointed Dr. Inka Hanefeld, a national of Germany, as arbitrator in this case, who accepted her appointment on 10 October 2019.\n\n34.\n\nBy emails of 10 November 2017, the Parties informed the Centre that they had agreed to appoint Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs, a national of Germany, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter of 14 November 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that Professor Dr. Sachs had declined his appointment.\n\n36.\n\nBy emails of 17 November 2017, the Parties informed the Centre that they had agreed to request the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council to appoint the presiding arbitrator. Accordingly, on 12 December 2017, ICSID sent the Parties a ballot inviting them to consider a list of candidates to act as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n37.\n\nBy emails of 21 December 2017, the Parties informed the Centre that they had conferred over the names proposed in the ballot and that they had agreed to appoint Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as presiding arbitrator.\n\n38.\n\nOn 4 January 2018, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules, notified the Parties that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, Dr. Alexandrov, and Dr. Hanefeld had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Laura Bergamini, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n39.\n\nBy emails of 8 January 2018, the Parties indicated that, unless the Tribunal had a preference for an in-person hearing, they agreed to hold the first session by telephone.\n\n40.\n\nBy letter of 15 January 2018, the Tribunal (i) proposed to hold the first session by telephone conference on 26 January 2018 and invited the Parties to confirm their availability; (ii) circulated a draft Procedural Order No. 1 and a draft agenda for the Parties to comment in preparation of the first session; and (iii) proposed the Parties to appoint Mr. David Khachvani, a lawyer from the President's firm, as Assistant to the Tribunal in this case.\n\n41.\n\nBy email of 17 January 2018, the Claimants confirmed the Parties' availability for a first session on the proposed date. The Claimants also indicated that:\n\n[T]he Claimants (who are first, and hopefully last, time users of the ICSID process) are initially uncomfortable with the Tribunal's proposal to delegate many important tasks to an assistant and to add a not inconsiderable costs line for this assistant in the draft procedural order. The Claimants reserve their position on this issue.\n\nIn the event that the parties agree to the appointment of an assistant, the parties respectfully propose that the assistant's role in \"preparing initial drafts of\u2026awards\" should be amended to read \"preparing initial drafts of the Procedural Background, Factual Background and Parties' Positions sections of any award\".\n\n42.\n\nBy email of the same date, the Respondent confirmed its availability on the proposed date for the first session. The Respondent further informed the Tribunal that it had no issue with the proposed appointment of Mr. Khachvani as Assistant to the Tribunal, but indicated that it \"would appreciate if the description of the role of the assistant in drafting procedural orders and awards was refined in a way to involve drafting \u2018appropriate parts' of such documents only.\"\n\n43.\n\nBy letter of 17 January 2018, the Tribunal confirmed that the first session would be held on 26 January 2018 by telephone conference.\n\n44.\n\nOn 24 January 2018, the Parties submitted a draft Procedural Order No. 1 containing their consolidated comments, along with their respective proposals for the procedural calendar.\n\n45.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 26 January 2018 by telephone conference.\n\n46.\n\nOn 2 February 2018, the Tribunal circulated a revised draft Procedural Order No. 1 and informed the Parties that such Procedural Order would become effective on 9 February 2018 unless a party requested the correction of a clerical mistake or raised a substantiated objection to a matter that had not already been the subject of discussion during the first session. The Tribunal also circulated the declaration signed by Mr. Khachvani.\n\n47.\n\nOn 9 February 2018, the Parties submitted their joint proposal for a revised draft Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n48.\n\nBy letter of 13 February 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was minded to accept the Parties' revised draft Procedural Order No. 1 subject to certain modifications, to which the Parties agreed by emails of the same date.\n\n49.\n\nOn 14 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of the proceedings would be Washington, D.C., USA. It also establishes the procedural calendar for the proceedings.\n\n50.\n\nBy letter of 30 March 2018, the Respondent raised a jurisdictional objection due to the outcome of the case *Slovak Republic v. Achmea* before the Court of Justice of the European Union, and requested that the Tribunal issue a decision to bifurcate the proceedings and hear this jurisdictional objection in a preliminary phase.\n\n51.\n\nBy letter of 4 April 2018, the Claimants presented their observations on the Respondent's request of 30 March 2018, as per the Tribunal's instructions.\n\n52.\n\nBy email of 5 April 2018, the Tribunal indicated that it understood that the Parties had presented their positions on the Respondent's request of 30 March 2018 and that, consequently, it would proceed with rendering the decision on bifurcation. The Tribunal also indicated that the procedural calendar set out in Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1 remained in force.\n\n53.\n\nOn 10 April 2018, the Tribunal decided on the Respondent's request of 30 March 2018 as follows:\n\nFor reasons of efficiency, especially because the agreed calendar which did not provide for bifurcation is already well under way, the Tribunal is of the view that the proceedings should now continue as scheduled. The Achmea defense (and any others) can be addressed in the context of the Counter-Memorial and of the further submissions.\n\n54.\n\nOn 27 April 2018, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits, together with the witness statement of Mr. Andrew Alexander Hunter, the expert report of Mr. James Gilbey FCA, the expert opinion of Professor G\u00e1bor Halmai, exhibits C-26 through C-131, and legal authorities CL-3 through CL-29.\n\n55.\n\nBy email of 4 May 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to indicate their preference in respect of the place of the hearing.\n\n56.\n\nBy email of the same date, the Claimants indicated their preference for a hearing in Paris, France.\n\n57.\n\nBy email of 8 May 2018, the Respondent indicated that, despite its preference to hold the hearing in Washington, D.C., it remained amenable to compromise on the hearing to take place in Paris, France.\n\n58.\n\nOn 8 May 2018, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would be held at the World Bank offices in Paris, France.\n\n59.\n\nOn 22 August 2018, the European Commission filed an application to intervene as a non-disputing party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2) (the \"**Commission's Application**\").\n\n60.\n\nOn 30 August 2018, the Parties filed their observations on the Commission's Application.\n\n61.\n\nOn 5 September 2018, the Tribunal decided that it:\n\n(i) grants the Commission leave to file a written amicus curiae submission by 20 January 2019, limited to the legal consequences of the Achmea Judgment for the present case;\n\n(ii) allows the Commission to access the relevant parts of the Parties' written submissions (excluding evidence) as set out above;\n\n(iii) denies the Commission's request to attend hearings and to present oral arguments.\n\n62.\n\nOn 7 September 2018, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction, together with the witness statement of Dr. M\u00e1rton \u00d6rs Bitay, the expert opinion of Professor Attila Menyh\u00e1rd, the expert report of Messrs.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe following summary, which does not purport to be exhaustive, aims at providing the general factual background for the Tribunal's analysis. The Tribunal will address the facts relevant to its reasoning in more detail in Sections IV to VI.\n\n**A. OVERVIEW OF THE AGRICULTURAL LAND REGULATION IN HUNGARY**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nFollowing the fall of the communist regime in Hungary in 1989, the Hungarian agriculture industry experienced a profound transformation. From 1990 to 1994, the State privatized a substantial portion of its farmland, dividing it into small individual parcels.23 At the end of the privatization process, over 85% of the agricultural land was privately owned, less than 15% remaining in State ownership. That being so, the division of land into small parcels stood in the way of mechanization and efficient farming. These factors seriously hampered the productivity of the Hungarian agriculture industry in the years that followed.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 31.\n\n110.\n\nTo regulate the acquisition and ownership of the newly privatized agricultural land, on 27 June 1994, the Hungarian Parliament enacted the Arable Land Act (the \"**1994 Arable Land Act**\").24 Under the new Act, only physical persons of Hungarian nationality were authorized to acquire agricultural land, while domestic and foreign corporations, as well as foreign nationals were barred from such acquisition. The latter were, however, allowed to lease agricultural land from Hungarian nationals or from the State. Leases were limited to a maximum term of 10 years and a maximum surface area of 300 hectares.25 In addition, the 1994 Arable Land Act conferred a statutory pre-lease right on lessees of agricultural land in the following terms:\n\nThe ex-lessee shall be entitled to the right of pre-lease for the arable land taken on usufructuary lease, except if the contract of usufructuary lease ceased to exist as a consequence of termination by notice with immediate effect by the lessor.26\n\nThe 1994 Arable Land Act, 27 July 1994, R-4.\n\nThe 1994 Arable Land Act, 27 July 1994, R-4, Sections 13, 25.\n\nThe 1994 Arable Land Act, 27 July 1994, R-4, Section 21.\n\n111.\n\nIn spite of the fragmentation of the agricultural land ownership into small parcels, under the new Act, certain large-scale farming enterprises managed to amass considerable portions of arable land by obtaining leases of private and State-owned land. As a result, by the end of the century, \"[s]trong disconnection between land use and land ownership became a typical feature of the farming structure\" in Hungary.27\n\nRCM, \u00b6 29.\n\n**B. THE CLAIMANTS' FARMING BUSINESS IN HUNGARY**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nIt was against this background that, in 1997, a group of British farming professionals led by Mr. Andrew Hunter decided to invest in the agricultural sector in Hungary.28 A tenant farmer's son from Yorkshire, Mr. Hunter managed a large agricultural enterprise in the UK.29 Together with his partners, Mr. Simon Weaver and Mr. Michael Papworth, Mr. Hunter travelled to Hungary several times in the summer of 1997 to visit several farms on sale.\n\nCM, \u00b6 2; Hunter First WS, Section 3.\n\nCM, \u00b6\u00b6 2, 20; RCM, \u00b6 74.\n\n113.\n\nAfter going from farm to farm, Mr. Hunter and his partners came across a livestock farm owned by In\u00edcia in the region of Ikr\u00e9ny, close to the Hungarian border with Austria and Slovakia. The farm had been privatized in 1994 by the statutory transformation of a State farming enterprise into a company limited by shares.30 It was composed of two livestock units and held a lease for approximately 760 hectares of State-owned land surrounding the livestock units. In addition, it had about 155 hectares of freehold agricultural land and approximately 300-400 hectares of privately leased land.31\n\nCM, \u00b6 23.\n\nHunter First WS, \u00b6 15; Minutes of the meeting of Gy\u0151r-Moson-Sopron County Local Authority, 11 November 1993, C-93.\n\n114.\n\nTo facilitate the purchase of the farm, Mr. Hunter and his partners incorporated Magyar Farming Company Ltd as a holding company in the UK32 and Kintyre Agricultural Trade and Serice Kft as its Hungarian subsidiary. On 13 January 1998, Kintyre acquired 95.13% shares of In\u00edcia for a purchase price of HUF 106.5 million.33 Mr. Hunter moved to Hungary as the managing director of the farm.\n\nCertificate of Incorporation for Magyar Farming Company Limited, 15 October 1997, C-26.\n\nShare Sale Purchase Agreement of In\u00edcia dated 13 January 1998, C-34, Section 1, paragraph 1.\n\n115.\n\nOver the following 16 years, the Claimants transformed what they call \"an indebted farm\" into a successful agricultural enterprise.34 In 1998-99, the Claimants imported 696 pregnant heifers from Holland and renovated the existing cow accommodation, building a 304-cow cubicle shed, workshops and tractor sheds as well as a 3,000-ton grain store and straw shed.\n\nCM, \u00b6 22; Summary of In\u00edcia's Debt Payments, C-35.\n\n116.\n\nApart from cow farming, the Claimants started producing potatoes and, in 2009, built a new 5,000-ton potato storage and packing facility. In 2011, the Claimants also constructed a 637kW biogas power plant, producing electricity from cow manure and supplying it to the national grid. The farm employed 45 local people and received various certificates of acclaim from local authorities.35\n\n2005 Best Taxpayer's Certificate issued by Enese Community, C-29; Letter from the Tax Office of 15 September 2014, C-30.\n\n**C. THE LEASE AGREEMENT AND THE PRE-LEASE RIGHT**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nOne of the assets that In\u00edcia held when the Claimants acquired it in 1998 was the Lease.36 This was a ten-year profit lease (*\"haszonberlet\"*) covering 760 hectares of State-owned land. Pursuant to the Civil Code of Hungary, a profit lease entitles the lessee in exchange of payment \"to use and collect the proceeds of a designated parcel of agricultural land or some other profitable thing for a specific time\".37 The lease was concluded in 1994 and was therefore due to expire in 2004. However, it provided for a pre-lease right:\n\nAt the request of the lessor, the tenant shall agree to the extension of the contract term, with the same business, payment and contractual conditions at least. In respect of these plots of land, the lessor grants a pre-lease right to the current tenant.38\n\n1994 Lease Agreement, C-33.\n\nExtracts from the Civil Code, C-62, Section 452(1).\n\nLease Agreement, 25 July 1994, C-6.\n\n118.\n\nThe Parties agree on the following general description of the pre-lease right under Hungarian law:\n\nIf a person has a pre-lease right over property, and the property owner intends to lease this property, then the owner must inform the holder of the pre-lease right about any offer from a third party that he or she intends to accept. Thereafter, the holder of the pre-lease right, by exercising the pre-lease right by unilateral declaration, may step in and assume the offer from the third party and thereby create a lease contract between the owner and the holder of the pre-lease right upon the terms offered by the third party.39\n\n[\u2026]\n\nA pre-lease right is not an option to lease. The holder of the pre-lease right cannot oblige the owner to enter into a lease if the property owner does not want to lease out his or her property [\u2026] The owner does not have to offer the property first to the pre-lease right holder. The prelease right applies only if an offer has already been made for the lease of the property and the owner accepts such offer.40\n\nCM, \u00b6 123; RCM, \u00b6 70.\n\nCM, \u00b6 124; RCM, \u00b6 96.\n\n119.\n\nIt is also common ground that a pre-lease right can be statutory or contractual. The former is a right created by law and existing irrespective of the Parties' agreement, while the latter is the result of an agreement and its scope and terms depend on the content of such agreement. In addition to the pre-lease provision in the Lease, In\u00edcia had a statutory pre-lease right pursuant to the 1994 Arable Land Act, in the following terms:\n\nThe ex-lessee shall be entitled to the right of pre-lease for the arable land taken on usufructuary lease, except if the contract of usufructuary lease ceased to exist as a consequence of termination by notice with immediate effect by the lessor.41\n\n1994 Arable Land Act, 27 July 1994, R-4, Section 21.\n\n120.\n\nIn 1999, In\u00edcia and the State Privatization and Property Plc, an agency managing the State property, concluded an amendment to the Lease (the \"**1999 Lease Amendment**\"), which envisaged the conclusion of the renewed lease over the Land for a period of 10 years starting from 1 July 1999.42 The effect of the 1999 Lease Amendment was that the Lease, which was previously due to expire in 2004, was extended by five years to 2009. The language of the provision concerning the pre-lease right remained unaltered.\n\n1999 Lease Agreement, C-38.\n\n121.\n\nIn 2002, an amendment to the 1994 Arable Land Act modified the maximum permissible duration of agricultural leases from 10 to 20 years.43 Three years later, in April 2005, upon a reminder from the State Tenant Association, In\u00edcia requested from the State a modification of the Lease in order to benefit from the new 20-year maximum duration.44 The NLA informed In\u00edcia that the 20-year lease term would start running from the date of the original conclusion of the Lease in 1994, with the result that the renewed Lease would expire in 2014. Given that the expiry of the Lease was otherwise due in 2009, the proposed amendment would effectively extend the Lease by five more years. Therefore, In\u00edcia went ahead with its request.\n\nAct XXIII of 2002, C-41, Article 22(5).\n\nLetter of 26 April 2005 from AFOSZ to In\u00edcia, C-39.\n\n122.\n\nOn 16 November 2006, In\u00edcia and the NLA thus entered into an amendment to the Lease (the \"**2006 Lease Amendment**\"), under which the Lease was extended to 25 July 2014.45 In addition, the 2006 Lease Amendment carved out a 75-hectare plot from the scope of the Lease.46 Most importantly, the new agreement modified the previous language of the pre-lease provision to read as follows:\n\nWith regard to the plots of land subject to the lease, the Tenant enjoys a pre-emption right and a pre-lease right that may be exercised in accordance with the applicable laws effective at all times, and which may not be registered in the Land Registry. [\u2026] Tenant is not entitled to exercise its pre-lease right, if the lease ceased to exist or was terminated for a cause arising on the side of the Tenant.47\n\n2006 Lease Agreement, C-40, Section 4.\n\nHunter First WS, \u00b6 38; 2006 Lease Agreement, C-40.\n\n2006 Lease Agreement, C-40, Section 5.1.\n\n123.\n\nThe Parties dispute the effect of the new language of the provision. In particular, they diverge on whether the 2006 Lease Amendment extinguished the contractual pre-lease right, leaving In\u00edcia only with the statutory pre-lease right.\n\n**D. BACKGROUND AND ADOPTION OF THE 2011 AMENDMENT**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nAs described above, as a result of the privatization process, agricultural land in Hungary was fragmented into multiple small parcels owned mainly by private citizens and, in a smaller part, by the State. Large agricultural enterprises, such as In\u00edcia, then leased many of those parcels for farming, given that enterprises were not themselves allowed to own agricultural land.\n\n125.\n\nIn 1998, the Hungarian Civic Alliance (\"**Fidesz**\"), a national-conservative political party, came to power in Hungary. As it was unsatisfied with the established composition of the agricultural sector and, in particular, with the erosion of the rural population, the new government made agricultural land reform one of its main priorities. The reform was primarily aimed at \"citizenisation of the countryside\" by supporting \"family-based agricultural businesses\" so that \"they c[ould] stay in competition with large companies.\"48\n\nFIDESZ 1998-2002 Programme, R-7, point 11.\n\n126.\n\nWithin the ambit of the reform, the government created the NLA, a management body for the State-owned agricultural land.49 In 2002, the Hungarian Parliament amended the 1994 Arable Land Act by introducing a ranking system for the exercise of pre-lease rights, granting priority to family farmers and local villagers, while placing former lessees, such as the Claimants, in an inferior position.50 As described above, this amendment also extended the maximum permissible duration of a lease from 10 to 20 years.\n\nAct CXVI of 2001 on the National Land Reserves, 1 January 2002, R-8.\n\nSections 13 and 21 of the 1994 Arable Land Act, in force from 22 February 2002 to 2 September 2002, C-122.\n\n127.\n\nThe reform was, however, put on hold due to a change of government in 2002. The new socialist government re-amended the 1994 Arable Land Act to reinstitute the former system, placing former lessees first in the order of priority.51\n\nSection 21 of the 1994 Arable Land Act, in force from 2 September 2002 to 15 December 2013, C-123.\n\n128.\n\nIn 2004, Hungary's accession to the European Union further affected Hungarian small farmers, placing them at a competitive disadvantage with the significantly more developed European agriculture industry. This accelerated the ongoing process of erosion of the country's rural population.52\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 50-52.\n\n129.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Fidesz government returned to power in 2010. It resumed the agricultural reform that was halted in 2002. On 12 August 2010, the Hungarian Parliament enacted the Act on the National Land Agency (the \"**2010 Act**\"). The 2010 Act mandated the re-distribution of the State-owned agricultural land with the aim of promoting \"viable family farms\".53 The implementation decree of the 2010 Act set out a procedure governing the tenders for leasing State-owned agricultural land.54 The procedure favored local family farms and individuals with professional agricultural credentials over large farming enterprises.\n\nAct LXXXVII of 2010 on the National Land Fund, 12 August 2010 (the \"2010 NLA Act\"), R-12, Section 1.\n\nDecree 262/2010 on the Detailed Rules of the Utilization of Land Parcels Assigned to the National Land Fund, 17 November 2010, C-44.\n\n130.\n\nAt that time, the implementation decree maintained the existing pre-lease rights with the result that, if the winning bidder of the tender was not the same person as the pre-lease right holder, the NLA was to communicate to the pre-lease right holder, by way of public notice, the fact that a winning bid had been filed. If the pre-lease right holder then submitted an identical offer to the winning bid, the NLA would conclude the lease agreement with the pre-lease right holder instead of the winner of the tender.55\n\nDecree 262/2010 on the Detailed Rules of the Utilization of Land Parcels Assigned to the National Land Fund, 17 November 2010, C-44, Sections 27 and 28.\n\n131.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the government soon realized that maintaining the pre-lease right for incumbent lessees contradicted the objectives of the land reform. In particular, it did not allow for the redistribution of the land to the favored categories of farmers, such as local, young (less than 40 years old) individuals or family entrepreneurs, holding agricultural qualifications and preferably being at a start-up stage. Even if such individuals managed to win tenders due to the ranking system that was favorable to them, the incumbent lessees with pre-lease rights could defeat the tender results by submitting a matching offer.56\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 130 and 136; See the Reasoning for Act CI of 2011 on the amendment of certain acts relating to agricultural land, 19 July 2011, C-45.\n\n132.\n\nTherefore, on 9 July 2011, the Parliament amended the 2010 Act (the \"**2011 Amendment**\"), precluding the exercise of statutory pre-lease rights in cases where State-owned land was leased through a tender:\n\nIn case of leasehold of rural land or farm, a pre-lease right arising from legal regulations may not be exercised.57\n\nAct CI of 2011 on the amendment of certain acts relating to agricultural land, 19 July 2011, C-45, Article 11.\n\n133.\n\nIt is undisputed that this provision affected only statutory, as opposed to contractual prelease rights.\n\n**E. THE 2014 TENDERS**\n-----------------------\n\n134.\n\nPursuant to the 2010 Act and its implementing directive, the NLA started organizing tenders for leasing State-owned agricultural land as the existing lease agreements were expiring. The process was named the \"Land for Farmers Programme\".\n\n135.\n\nThe scoring system for the tenders was set out in the Instruction of the Minister of Agriculture.58 Apart from other criteria, such as the viability of the business plan and environmental conservation, the system favored local family farmers with agricultural diplomas and young farmers:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Evaluation criteria** | **Achieved score** | **Evaluation weighting value** | **Cumulated score** |\n| 1. | **Candidate's economic situation** |  |  |  |\n| 1.1. | Legal and structural form of the entity: Family fanner Individual agricultural entrepreneur: Primary poducer (if acquired the title) Cooperative, company or other commercial entity | 10 8 7 3 | 1 |  |\n| 1.2. | The ditance between the candidate's residence or seat and the applied plots of land (according to Section 11.2. j) of the Tender Notice) between 0-10 km between 10-20 km | 10 8 | 2 |  |\n| 1.3. | The candidate obtains a diploma relevant to the duties involved (yes/no): Yes / **No** | 10 1 | 1 |  |\n| 1.4. | The candidate's relevant farming experience: between 3-5 years between 5-10 years over 10 years | 3 5 10 | 1 |  |\n\nTender Evaluation Sheet, R-18.\n\n136.\n\nAs set out above, the Lease was due to expire on 25 July 2014. Thus, starting from March 2013, the NLA announced a series of tenders for granting new leases over the Land. More precisely, in line with the objectives of promoting small family farms, the NLA divided the Land into 16 plots and announced a separate tender for each of the plots (the \"**Tenders**\").59 Pursuant to the 2011 Amendment, the announcement specified that the incumbent lessee could not exercise the pre-emption or pre-lease rights over the land forming the subject of the Tenders.60\n\nCall for Tender, 5 April 2013, C-64; CM, \u00b6 55; RCM, \u00b6 127.\n\nCall for Tender, 5 April 2013, C-64.\n\n137.\n\nConcerned with the prospect of losing the Lease, in April 2013, the Claimants wrote to Hungary's Ambassador in London, describing the background of their investment in Hungary and highlighting the importance of stability of the Lease for the continuation of their business.61 The Embassy responded on 29 May 2013, stating that the problem of the renewal of lease contracts would be \"satisfactorily resolved\" by \"the new Act\".62\n\nLetter of 22 April 2013 from Magyar Farming to Hungarian Embassy, C-12.\n\nLetter of 29 May 2013 from Hungarian Embassy to Magyar Farming, C-13.\n\n138.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the reference to \"the new Act\" was to the 2013 amendment to the 2010 Act (the \"**2013 Amendment**\"), which the Parliament had passed on 22 May 2013, a few days before the Embassy's letter. The 2013 Amendment granted the NLA a discretionary power to extend the duration of existing leases for lessees who benefitted from EU or national subsidies until they discharged their subsidy obligations.63 The Ministry of Rural Development clarified, however, that this possibility did not apply to leases that had already reached the statutory maximum duration of 20 years.64\n\nAct LXXXVII of 2010 on the National Land Fund, 23 May 2013, R-13, Section 18 (1c).\n\nMinistry of Rural Development, \"Framework Programme for the Implementation of the National Rural Development Strategy\", August 2013, R-14.\n\n139.\n\nThe Claimants attempted to take advantage of the 2013 Amendment by submitting a request to the NLA to renew the Lease for a period of five years, arguing that many national and EU subsidies they had received were contingent upon pursuing their farming activities beyond the expiration of the Lease in July 2014. On 9 July 2013, the NLA rejected the Claimants' request, stating that the 2013 Amendment conferred on it a discretion to renew lease agreements and that it was under no obligation to do so.65\n\nLetter of 9 July 2013 from the NLA to In\u00edcia Zrt, C-14.\n\n140.\n\nIn addition to the exchanges with the Hungarian Embassy, on 30 May 2013, the Claimants attended a meeting organized by the British Embassy in Hungary. Mr. Hunter made a PowerPoint presentation of the Claimants' farming business in Hungary.66 The Claimants assert that, after the meeting, the Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Fazekas assured Mr. Hunter that \"he could not see anyone entering the tender with a stronger claim, so In\u00edcia just needed to enter the tender and there would be nothing to worry about.\"67\n\nPowerPoint presentation, C-51.\n\nCM, \u00b6 54, referring to Hunter First WS, \u00b6 45.\n\n141.\n\nIn\u00edcia thus submitted bids for the Tenders in June 2013.68 In January 2014, the NLA announced the results of the Tenders. All 16 of In\u00edcia's bids were unsuccessful. The plots were awarded to local farmers. The names of the winning bidders were published on the NLA's website.69 In February 2014, the NLA proceeded to conclude 20-year lease agreements with the winners.70\n\nCM, \u00b6 55; RCM, \u00b6 140.\n\nExtract from the Tender Results, C-59.\n\nCM, \u00b6 63.\n\n142.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the reasons for In\u00edcia's loss. The Claimants contend that the NLA awarded In\u00edcia's bids artificially low scores in the discretionary component of the \"professional and commercial well-foundedness of the business plan\".71 The Respondent in turn suggests that In\u00edcia's bids were unsuccessful as they were not overall in line with the policy-related criteria for awarding leases of the State-owned land, including the criteria that favored local and young family farmers. In addition, according to the Respondent, in five instances In\u00edcia's bids were simply disqualified on the basis that they failed to attach all supporting documents that the tender rules required.72\n\nCM, \u00b6 210.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 279; See, Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10234, C-158; Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10235, C-159; Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10274, C-160; Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10277, C-161; Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10278, C-162.\n\n143.\n\nAccording to the 2015 statistical report of the Ministry of Agriculture, the tenders that the NLA conducted between 2010 and 2015 significantly altered the demographics of the State-owned land holding. Specifically, the number of tenants rose drastically by more than tenfold, from 600 in 2010 to 7500 in 2015. Nearly 85% of the new tenants were natural persons, and 21% of them were young farmers under the age of 40.73\n\nRCM, \u00b6 159; Summary of Results of the \"Land for Farmers\" Programme 2010-2015, R-19, p. 2\n\n**F. DOMESTIC PROCEEDINGS**\n---------------------------\n\n144.\n\nOn 31 January and 5 February 2014, after the announcement of the results of the Tenders, In\u00edcia wrote to the NLA, affirming the entitlement \"to the pre-lease right established in Section 5.1 of the lease agreement concluded with the National Land Agency on 26 November 2006\".74 In\u00edcia also requested the NLA to disclose the content of the winning bids. The NLA did not respond.\n\nLetter of 31 January 2014 from In\u00edcia's lawyers to the NLA, C-16; Letter of 5 February 2014 from PWC to the NLA, C-63.\n\n145.\n\nIn May 2014, a Hungarian court ordered the NLA, upon In\u00edcia's application, to disclose the winning bids,75 but the NLA failed to comply. After In\u00edcia engaged bailiffs to enforce the court's order, the NLA disclosed the winning bids in March 2017.76\n\nThe Metropolitan Court Order of 13 May 2014, C-17.\n\nCM, \u00b6 64.\n\n146.\n\nIn addition, In\u00edcia commenced court proceedings to obtain disclosure of the scoring sheets for the Tenders.77 The first instance court ordered the NLA to disclose the documents on 27 October 2017.78 The second instance court confirmed the order on 31 January 2018.79 The Respondent requested an *ex parte* extraordinary review of the second instance court decision by the Supreme Court (also referred to as the \"**Curia**\"), which is still pending. In the meantime, however, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to disclose the scoring sheets in a document production exercise in this arbitration. The Respondent complied with the order.80\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 174.\n\n1st Instance Court Judgment to disclose documents, 27 October 2017, C-145.\n\n2nd Instance Court Judgment to disclose documents, 31 January 2018, C-146.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 175; C-147 to C-162.\n\n147.\n\nSeparately, on 29 April 2014, In\u00edcia formally notified the NLA that it exercised the pre-lease rights and requested the NLA to sign lease agreements with In\u00edcia \"with the same conditions as were granted to the winning tender applicants\".81 Receiving no response, on 6 June 2014, In\u00edcia filed an action against the NLA and the winners of the Tenders before the first instance court at the Pest district, requesting the judicial recognition of its exercise of the pre-lease right under Section 5.1 of the Lease and enjoinment of the NLA to conclude lease agreements with In\u00edcia upon the terms of the winning bids.\n\nLetter of 29 April 2014 from In\u00edcia to the NLA, C-20; CM, \u00b6 78.\n\n148.\n\nThe dispute was entertained at all levels of the Hungarian judiciary and involved the following steps:\n\n\u2022 The first instance court of the district of Pest dismissed In\u00edcia's claims on 21 October 2014.82 The court primarily based its decision on the fact that the winners of the Tenders were acting in good faith, without the knowledge of In\u00edcia's claims in relation to the Land.\n\n\u2022 In\u00edcia appealed the first instance court's judgment before the second instance court (also referred to as the \"**Metropolitan Court**\"). The Metropolitan Court dismissed the appeal on 12 November 2015, finding that the language of the Lease and in particular the new language of the pre-lease clause introduced by the 2006 Lease Amendment did not grant In\u00edcia a contractual pre-lease right.83\n\n\u2022 In\u00edcia then initiated a review procedure before the Supreme Court. On 25 January 2017, Panel V of the Curia annulled the Metropolitan Court decision due to a lack of sufficient reasoning and remanded the case back to the Metropolitan Court for reconsideration.84\n\n\u2022 On 7 December 2017, the Metropolitan Court once again dismissed In\u00edcia's claims.85 The court relied on the interpretation of a similar pre-lease provision that another panel of the Curia, Panel VI, gave in a separate case (so-called Szell\u0151h\u00e1t Case).86\n\n\u2022 In\u00edcia filed a request for extraordinary review with the Curia, which is still pending.87\n\nJudgment of First Instance (No. 25.P.52795/2014/17) 21 October 2014 (\"the In\u00edcia Case\"), C-115.\n\nJudgment of Second Instance (No. 44.

EVICTION**\n---------------\n\n149.\n\nA few days prior to the expiry of the Lease, on 21 July 2014, the NLA wrote to In\u00edcia, expressing the intention to retake the possession of the Land.88\n\nLetter of 21 July 2014 from the NLA to In\u00edcia, C-21.\n\n150.\n\nOn 24 July 2014, In\u00edcia obtained an order from the local municipality89 granting protection against eviction pending resolution of the proceedings that In\u00edcia had started before the District Court of Pest.90\n\nLocal Authority Orders of 24 July, 31 July and 5 August 2014, C-23.\n\n*Supra* \u00b6 147.\n\n151.\n\nNevertheless, on 25 July 2014, two NLA representatives arrived at the farm and invited In\u00edcia to sign a minute recording the takeover of the Land. Mr. Hunter signed the minute with a written reservation that In\u00edcia would not hand over the Land since it had properly exercised the pre-lease right and had obtained the protective order from the local municipality the day before.91\n\nMinute of 25 July 2014, C-22.\n\n152.\n\nIn\u00edcia subsequently obtained, on 31 July and 5 August 2014, three further orders from the local municipality granting protection against eviction pending the resolution of the court proceedings.92\n\nLocal Authority Orders of 24 July, 31 July and 5 August 2014, C-23.\n\n153.\n\nNevertheless, the NLA purported to transfer physical possession of the land to the winners of the Tenders on 16 October 2014. In\u00edcia refused to leave. The winners started arriving at the Land with their tractors to do seasonal works. This gave rise to a number of unpleasant incidents. According to the Respondent, on one occasion, Mr. Hunter physically assaulted a farmer.93\n\nRCM, \u00b6 181, referring to video footage R-23.\n\n154.\n\nIn turn, the Claimants contend that in an attempt to intimidate Mr. Hunter, the Respondent arrested him in February 2015. According to Mr. Hunter's testimony, he was taken to the local police station without any explanation. His request for access to a lawyer was denied. He was released the following morning without charge or any explanation for his detention.94\n\nHunter First WS, \u00b6 70.\n\n155.\n\nThe winners of the Tenders in turn obtained possessory protection against In\u00edcia from local notaries. In\u00edcia sought to overturn the notarial order before the first instance court in Gy\u0151r. On 21 May 2015, the court dismissed In\u00edcia's request, finding that, \"[n]otwithstanding the dispute regarding the pre-lease right [\u2026] the claimant [In\u00edcia] has no valid legal title\" and thus the NLA \"may request [In\u00edcia] to cease the nuisance.\"95\n\nRuling No. P.22.564/2014/12, 21 May 2015, R-21.\n\n156.\n\nThe confrontations between the new lessees and the Claimants lasted for almost a year. Finally, on 14 July 2015, the State Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture, Dr. M\u00e1rton Bitay, appeared in the fields with a television crew and armed private security guards. He vowed to \"protect the Hungarian agricultural land under all circumstances, not only legally, but physically as well\".96 The security guards remained on the Land to ensure In\u00edcia's eviction and the harvesting of crops by the winners of the Tenders. In the end, In\u00edcia was forced to abandon the Land.\n\nVideo footage and the Ministry of Agriculture Press Release of July 2015, C-24.\n\n157.\n\nSince the eviction, In\u00edcia continues its farming activities on the remainder of the land that it owned or leased from private owners. The Parties dispute the impact that the eviction from the Land had on the Claimants' farming business in Hungary.\n\n**H. SETTLEMENT EFFORTS**\n-------------------------\n\n158.\n\nOn 11 February 2014, shortly after the results of the Tenders had been announced, the British Ambassador, Jonathan Knott, met with Dr. M\u00e1rton Bitay of the Ministry of Agriculture (also referred to as the \"**Ministry of Rural Development**\") to discuss the position of the British farmers in Hungary in the face of the agricultural reform.97 In a follow up letter, Dr. Bitay wrote to the Ambassador, pointing out that the farmers had enough time to adjust to the new realities after the 2011 Amendment. Dr. Bitay suggested that if the farmers wished to offer their farms for sale to the Hungarian State, they should have contacted Dr. S\u00e1ndor Fazekas, Minister of Agriculture Hungary.98\n\nBritish Embassy email Note of Meeting of 11 February 2014, C-74.\n\nLetter of 17 March 2014 from Dr. Bitay to the British Embassy, C-75.\n\n159.\n\nIn\u00edcia's legal representatives from PricewaterhouseCoopers Legal (\"**PWC**\") thus wrote to Dr. Fazekas on 10 April 2014 offering to sell In\u00edcia's shares for HUF 4.95 billion (approx. EUR 16 million).99 On 30 May 2014, Dr. Bitay acknowledged receipt of the Claimants' offer.100 After several months of silence, on 16 September 2014, In\u00edcia re-submitted its offer.101\n\nLetter of 10 April 2014 from PWC to Dr. Fazekas, C-76.\n\nLetter of 30 May 2014 from Dr. Bitay to the British Ambassador, C-77 (The Ministry appears to have received the PWC offer of 10 April on 15 April 2014).\n\nLetter of 16 September 2014 from PWC to Dr. Fazekas, C-78.\n\n160.\n\nOn 6 November 2014, the British Ambassador met again with Dr. Bitay. According to the Embassy's notes, Dr. Bitay saw a contradiction in In\u00edcia's actions, as it purported to negotiate with the State, while at the same time litigating before the Hungarian courts.102\n\nBritish Embassy email Note of Meeting of 6 November 2014, C-79.\n\n161.\n\nOn 24 November 2014, Dr. Gyula Budai, the State Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, wrote to the British Ambassador stating that there was \"nothing in the way [of] beginning the acquisition negotiations, however, the documentation provided by In\u00edcia did not contain sufficient information for the evaluation of the business case.\"103\n\nLetter of 24 November 2014 from Dr. Budai to the British Ambassador, C-80.\n\n162.\n\nIn January 2016, Prime Minister Cameron and Prime Minister Orb\u00e1n reached a \"gentlemen's agreement\" that the Respondent would buy the Claimants' farm.104 In light of this agreement, Dr. Budai met with the British Ambassador on 3 February 2016. At the meeting, Dr. Budai suggested that the Claimants had two courses of action. First, the State could purchase their farm in exchange of compensation. Second, the Claimants could secure new leases for other comparable State-owned land plots, for which Mr. Hunter could participate in auctions announced by the NLA.105\n\nBritish Embassy email 12 June 2017, referring to the Cameron-Orban agreement, C-92.\n\nBritish Embassy email Note of Meeting of 3 February 2016, C-82.\n\n163.\n\nHowever, on 13 April 2017, the Claimants received a letter from the Hungarian National Asset Management Agency (\"**MNV**\") stating that \"the acquisition of ownership in In\u00edcia [\u2026] for the benefit of the Hungarian state [\u2026] [did] not fit into the government's current strategic plans and goals.\"106 On 27 April 2017, the British Ambassador swiftly arranged a meeting with Dr. Budai, who assured him that the option of purchasing the Claimants' farm was still on the table.107\n\nLetter of 13 April 2017 from the MNV to PWC, C-90.\n\nBritish Embassy email Note of Meeting of 27 April 2017, C-91.\n\n164.\n\nIn the meantime, the Respondent retained KPMG to value the Claimants' Hungarian subsidiaries, Kintyre and In\u00edcia. According to the Respondent, KPMG's highest valuation came to HUF 1.7 billion for the two companies (approximately USD 6.2 million at the rates in effect at the time). According to Mr. Hunter, he was allowed to consult the report on 10 July 2017 upon signing a non-disclosure agreement, and when he asked KPMG why the valuation was so low, he was told that it was due to the farm's shortage of land.108\n\nHunter First WS, \u00b6 86.\n\n165.\n\nAfter exchanges spanning over a period of almost three years, on 3 July 2017, the MNV communicated its counter-proposal to purchase the farm for HUF 700 million (EUR 2.2 million) to the Claimants.109 Given the stark difference between the proposals, the Parties failed to reach an agreement. The Claimants thus initiated the present arbitration on 4 July 2017.\n\nHunter First WS, \u00b6 85; See also, British Embassy email Note of Meeting of 8 June 2017, C-92.\n\n166.\n\nThe Parties dispute the impact of the loss of the Land on the Claimants' farming business. While the Claimants assert that Hungary's measures rendered their farm \"unsaleable\"110, the Respondent points to the fact that the Claimants continue to derive profit from their Hungarian farm to this day.111\n\nCM, \u00b6 112.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 198.\n\n**IV. JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Respondent raises two jurisdictional objections. First, it contends that its consent to arbitrate contained in the BIT was rendered inapplicable by Hungary's accession to the EU in 2004 and therefore there is no valid arbitration agreement (A). Second, it claims that the present dispute does not arise out of an investment that would be capable of being expropriated and thus the dispute is outside the subject-matter scope of the BIT and the ICSID Convention (B). Beyond those objections, which will be dealt with below, the Parties do not dispute the jurisdiction of the Centre or the competence of the Tribunal, and rightly so.\n\n168.\n\nIt is undisputed that the Tribunal has the authority to resolve the objections to its competence and the jurisdiction of the Centre pursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:\n\n(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\n\n(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\n\n169.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will deal with each of the Respondent's objections in turn.\n\n**A. INTRA-EU OBJECTION**\n-------------------------\n\n170.\n\nIt is common ground that Article 8 of the BIT contains Hungary's consent to arbitration.112 The Parties dispute, however, whether that consent was rendered inapplicable by Hungary's accession to the EU and its consequent ratification of the Treaty on the European Union (\"**TEU**\") and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"**TFEU**\") (together the \"**EU Treaties**\").\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37; R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 55.\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction since the BIT's offer to arbitrate, which the Claimants purported to accept by their trigger letter of 12 November 2015 and in the Request for Arbitration,113 had long been extinguished by virtue of Hungary's accession to the EU Treaties in 2004.\n\nRfA, \u00b6 23.\n\n***a. Article 8 BIT is incompatible with the EU Treaties***\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the BIT's dispute resolution provision is incompatible with the EU Treaties. It primarily relies on the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"**CJEU**\") in *Slovak Republic v. Achmea B.V.* (the \"**Achmea Decision**\"),114 in which the CJEU determined that the dispute resolution provisions in the investment treaties concluded between the EU Member States were contrary to the EU Treaties:\n\nArticles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.115\n\n*Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, Case C-284/16, Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber), 6 March 2018, EU:C:2018:158, RL-12.\n\n*Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, Case C-284/16, Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber), 6 March 2018, EU:C:2018:158, RL-12, \u00b6 62.\n\n173.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Achmea Decision is dispositive of the incompatibility between the BIT's dispute resolution provision and the EU Treaties, since the CJEU decisions have *erga omnes* effect vis-\u00e0-vis all EU Member States*.*116 This was confirmed by the 2019 Declarations as issued by 23 EU Member States, including Hungary and the UK, affirming that \"all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus inapplicable.\"117 As the PCIJ held in the *Jaworzina* opinion, the treaty-making parties \"acting in consensus remain the masters of their treaty and can, therefore, determine its meaning with binding force.\"118\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 76.\n\nDeclaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union (15 January 2019), RL-76; Declaration of the Representatives of the Government of Hungary on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union (16 January 2019), RL-77.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 85, citing D\u00f6rr, Schmalenbach, *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary* (Springer, 2018), RL-19, 570, \u00b6 20.\n\n174.\n\nAccording to Hungary, the Claimants are asking the Tribunal to ignore the authoritative decision of the CJEU and the binding interpretation given by the BIT's Contracting States. This request should be rejected as, contrary to the Claimants' arguments, there is no reason for a different conclusion. More specifically, Hungary makes the following submissions:\n\n\u2022 While the Claimants rely on the fact that this is an ICSID arbitration, unlike the one at issue in the Achmea Decision (the \"**Achmea Arbitration**\"), this is all the more reason to follow the analysis of the Achmea Decision. There, the CJEU reasoned that the courts of the Member States did not retain sufficient control over the Achmea Arbitration in respect of the application of EU law, despite the fact that the arbitration was seated in Frankfurt and that Member State courts had jurisdiction over the ensuing award in set aside and enforcement proceedings. In turn, the Contracting States of the ICSID Convention are arguably under an obligation to enforce ICSID awards without scrutinizing them even for the limited ground of public policy.119 The absence of substantive review of the application of EU law by courts sitting within the EU system is precisely the reason why the Achmea Decision held that there was an incompatibility between the intra-EU BITs and the EU Treaties. This incompatibility is amplified in the ICSID context.\n\n\u2022 The Claimants' contention that the existence of the conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and the EU Treaties should be viewed from the public international law perspective is uncontested but does not change the fact that there is an incompatibility between these successive treaties. As a result of the Achmea Decision, the incompatibility is itself a rule of public international law. In this respect, the Claimants' reliance on pre-Achmea investment awards is misguided, as the value of these awards cannot be compared with that of a CJEU decision. Again, the CJEU determines the content of the EU Treaties with mandatory and *erga omnes* effect.\n\n\u2022 The Claimants' argument that the BIT and the EU Treaties do not regulate the same subject matter and therefore one cannot prevail over the other under Article 30(3) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\") is also unavailing. Scholars suggest that the notion of subject matter must be understood broadly, because a strict interpretation \"leads to a *reductio ad absurdum*.\"120\n\n\u2022 Similarly, the Claimants' argument that the Achmea Decision was based on a different BIT \"in which, unlike the UK-Hungary BIT, the law of an EU Member State was expressly incorporated as part of the governing law\"121 is inapposite. On the basis of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, in the absence of a choice of law in the treaty, the law of the host State, including EU law applies to the merits of the dispute. This difference between the BIT applicable here and the Slovak-Netherlands BIT at issue in the Achmea Decision is, therefore, immaterial.122\n\nRCM, \u00b6 284.\n\nReport of the Study Group of the International Law Commission, Fragmentation of International Law \u2013 Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, A/CN.4/L.682 (13 April 2006), RL-27, \u00b6 22.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 70(ii).\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\n175.\n\nFor these reasons, according to Hungary, the Claimants' reliance on the pre- *Achmea* decisions of investment tribunals, such as *Electrabel v. Hungary,*123 and *RREEF Infrastructure v. Spain*124 is unavailing as those decisions were not informed by the CJEU's authoritative interpretation of the EU Treaties.\n\n*Electrabel S. A. v.

Spain*\"), CL-41.\n\n***b. The EU Treaties prevail***\n--------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the incompatibility between Article 8 of the BIT and the EU Treaties should be resolved in favor of the EU Treaties, as the CJEU authoritatively determined in the Achmea Decision. More specifically, the EU Treaties are later in time and should prevail pursuant to Article 30(3) of the VCLT, which contains the rule that *lex posterior derogat priori*. Contrary to the Claimants' assertion, it does not matter that the EU Treaties may have been in effect in some form since the 1957 Treaty of Rome. What matters, according to Hungary, is that it acceded to the EU in 2004 and the EU Treaties then became applicable between Hungary and the UK.125 Thus, in respect of the BIT, the EU Treaties constitute a *lex posterior*.126\n\nAct concerning the conditions of accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded, AA2003/ACT/en 1 (2003), RL-11.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 150-154.\n\n177.\n\nAnother conflict of treaties rule also speaks in favor of EU Treaties, namely the rule found in Article 30(2) of the VCLT, which reads as follows:\n\nWhen a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.\n\n178.\n\nArticle 351 of the TFEU is precisely the type of rule envisaged by Article 30(2) of the VCLT. It provides that the obligations set out in the EU Treaties prevail over those contained in agreements concluded prior to the accession to the EU.\n\n179.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants read Article 351 of the TFEU incorrectly when they argue that it \"only applies to agreements between EU Member States and \u2018third countries'\" and not to agreements between EU Member States. That argument is belied by consistent case law of the CJEU.127 The Claimants' reliance on *Vattenfall v. Germany* is unhelpful. In that case, the ICSID Tribunal found that there was no conflict between the Energy Charter Treaty's dispute resolution provision and the EU Treaties. It was therefore unnecessary to apply Article 351 of the TFEU.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 300-308, citing *Commission of the European Economic Community v. Government of Italian Republic*, Case No. 10/61, Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber) 27 February 1962, ECLI:EU:C:1962:2, p.10, Section B, RL-25; *Annunziata Matteucci v. Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise of Belgium and Commissariat general aux relations internationals (Foreign Relations Department) of the Communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise of Belgium*, Case No. 235/87, Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber), 27 September 1988, ECLI:EU:C:1988:460, RL-26, \u00b6 22; Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission, Fragmentation of International Law \u2013 Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law, A/CN.4/L.682 (13 April 2006), RL-27, \u00b6 283.\n\n180.\n\nHad the *Vattenfall* tribunal wished to assess the meaning of Article 351 of the TFEU, the Respondent submits that it would have relied on the CJEU's binding interpretation of this provision. Even if the *Vattenfall* tribunal had conducted a full analysis under treaty law, it would have concluded that this provision applies to treaties between EU Member States.\n\n181.\n\nAs for the Claimants' argument that it was incumbent upon Hungary and the UK to eliminate any incompatibilities between the BIT and the EU Treaties, the Respondent suggests that there exists no international obligation on States to remedy an incompatibility between successive treaties. Instead, the incompatibility is dealt with by Article 30(3) of the VCLT, which is clear in that the later treaty shall prevail. Therefore, no inferences can be drawn from the fact that the EU Member States have not formally amended or renounced their intra-EU BITs.128\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 73, citing *Vattenfall AB and others v. Federal Republic of Germany*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/12, Decision on the *Achmea* issue, 31 August 2018 (\"*Vattenfall v. Germany*\"), RL-22, \u00b6 208.\n\n182.\n\nFurther, for Hungary, the Claimants erroneously invoke Article 11 of the BIT, which provides in relevant part that \"[i]f the [\u2026] obligations under international law [\u2026] contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over the present Agreement.\"129 The Claimants wrongly suggest that this is a subordination clause of the type contemplated in Article 30(2) of the VCLT. Apart from the fact that Article 11 of the BIT does not at all address a *conflict* with other treaties, it only allows the application of more favorable \"treatment\" to the \"investment\". It does not deal with procedural mechanisms. Indeed, access to arbitration does not qualify as \"treatment\" of an investment but constitutes a procedural right.130\n\nUK-Hungary BIT, CL-1.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 133-138.\n\n183.\n\nIn any event, even if Article 11 were deemed a conflict rule, according to the Respondent, it would be in direct contradiction with Article 351 of the TFEU, which is a later conflict rule applicable between Hungary and the United Kingdom.\n\n184.\n\nAs to the Tribunal's question on the possible impact of the UK's announced withdrawal from the EU (\"**Brexit**\") jurisdiction must be assessed, so says Hungary, by reference to the date of the institution of the arbitral proceedings. At that time, the UK was an EU Member. In addition, despite Brexit, the UK subscribed to the 2019 Declarations, vowing to \"take the necessary measures to inform [arbitral tribunals]\" that \"[Article 8 of the BIT is] contrary to Union law and thus inapplicable.\"131\n\nDeclaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union, 15 January 2019, RL-76, pp. 1-3.\n\n185.\n\nFinally, contrary to the Claimants' contention, the Respondent argues that the principles of good faith and estoppel would not justify upholding jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case. The Claimants' good faith, which is not disputed, is not a reason for the Tribunal to rewrite the law and assume jurisdiction without the Respondent's consent.132 As for estoppel, under international law a party must make a clear statement or engage in consistent conduct on which the other party relies to its own detriment.133 The Claimants do not even come close to establishing that Hungary made a statement or engaged in conduct suggesting the compatibility of the BIT with the EU Treaties, and that the Claimants acted in reliance on such conduct.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 162.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 157, citing *Case concerning the land and maritime boundary between Cameroon and Nigeria (Cameroon v. Nigeria)*, International Court of Justice, Preliminary Objections, 11 June 1998, RL-88, \u00b6 57.\n\n**(2) The Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n186.\n\nThe Claimants submit that there is a valid arbitration agreement between the Parties, as they accepted the Respondent's offer to arbitrate contained in Article 8 of the BIT. Article 8 of the BIT contained a valid offer at the time when it accepted it by a letter of 12 November 2015 and in the Request for Arbitration of 4 July 2017. Indeed, (a) that provision is compatible with the EU Treaties, and (b) in any event, the EU Treaties do not prevail over the BIT.\n\n***a. Article 8 BIT is compatible with the EU Treaties***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Achmea Decision is not binding on this Tribunal, which should conduct an independent inquiry into its own jurisdiction under Article 41(1) of the ICSID Convention. As numerous investment treaty tribunals have made clear, this inquiry must be conducted under public international law and not exclusively under EU law.134\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59, *Electrabel v. Hungary*, RL-6, \u00b6 4.112; *RREEF Infrastructure v. Spain*, CL-41, \u00b6\u00b6 75 and 87.\n\n188.\n\nIt is also well-established in investment treaty jurisprudence that the dispute settlement provisions in investment treaties are easily reconcilable with the EU Treaties,135 and in particular with Articles 344 and 267 of the TFEU. These provisions read as follows:\n\nArticle 344\n\nMember States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties.\n\n[...]\n\nArticle 267\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning:\n\n(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;\n\n(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union.\n\n*Ivan Peter Busta and James Peter Busta v. The Czech Republic*, SCC Case No. V 2015/014, Final Award, 10 March 2017 (\"*Busta v. Czech Republic*\"), CL-42; *Anglia Auto Accessories Limited v. The Czech Republic,* SCC Case No. V 2014/181, Final Award, 10 March 2017; *Vattenfall v. Germany*, RL-22.\n\n189.\n\nIn the Claimants' submission, these provisions relate to actions brought by the Member States and say nothing about private parties bringing claims regarding the interpretation and application of a BIT. The test of incompatibility under the VCLT is strict and \"the mere fact that there was a difference between the provisions of a later treaty and those of an earlier treaty d[oes] not necessarily mean that there exist[s] an incompatibility\".136\n\nSinclair, *The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties* (2nd edition, 2018), CL-33, 97.\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimants further observe that the finding of incompatibility in the Achmea Decision was based on the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT which, different from the UK-Hungary BIT, chose the law of an EU Member State as part of the governing law. Although the Achmea Decision contains general language applying to other investment treaties \"such as\" the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, the words \"such as\" should be construed to refer only to ISDS clauses in investment treaties that contain governing law clauses similar to that of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT.\n\n***b. The EU Treaties do not prevail***\n---------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nEven if there were a conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and the EU Treaties, the Claimants submit that the latter would not prevail. The temporal conflicts rule contained in Article 30(3) of the VCLT only applies to successive treaties with the same subject matter. It is well established in public international law that this \"expression \u2018relating to the same subject-matter' must be construed strictly\" and that it does \"not cover cases where a general treaty impinges indirectly on the content of a particular provision of an earlier treaty.\"137 Many tribunals have made the obvious point that the subject matter of investment treaties is different from that of the TFEU, which concerns the functioning of the European Union.138 Therefore, the EU Treaties would not prevail over the BIT, even if they were in conflict.\n\nSinclair, *The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties* (2nd edition, 2018), CL-33, 98.\n\n*Busta v. Czech Republic*, CL-42, \u00b6\u00b6 115-16; *Oostergetel and Theodora Laurentius v. The Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Jurisdiction, 30 April 2010 (\"*Oostergetel v. Slovakia)*, \u00b6 75.\n\n192.\n\nEven if Article 30(3) is applied, it is unclear to the Claimants how the EU Treaties can be considered later in time than the BIT. In *Vattenfall v. Germany*, the ICSID tribunal noted that \"Articles 267 and 344 TFEU have existed in substantively similar form\" as part of the Treaty of Rome of 1957. Hence, for that tribunal \"it [was] by no means clear that the EU Treaties [were] the \u2018later treaty' under Article 30 VCLT.\"139\n\n*Vattenfall v. Germany*, RL-22, \u00b6 218.\n\n193.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants submit that the BIT should prevail over the EU Treaties pursuant to Article 30(2) of the VCLT. In particular, the Claimants suggest that Article 11 of the BIT is a subordination clause envisaged by Article 30(2) of the VCLT. The relevant part of Article 11 to which the Claimants refer reads as follows:\n\nIf [...] obligations under international law [...] established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more favourable prevail over the present Agreement.140\n\nUK-Hungary BIT, CL-1.\n\n194.\n\nFor the Claimants, the obvious *a contrario* reading of Article 11 is that the parties to the BIT intended the BIT to prevail to the extent that any later treaty offered less favorable treatment to the investments of investors. If the rules of the EU Treaties render Article 8 of the BIT inapplicable, then such rules would clearly result in less favourable treatment for the Claimants, and therefore the BIT terms would prevail.\n\n195.\n\nIn this connection, the Claimants consider the Respondent's invocation of Article 351 of the TFEU ill-conceived. As the *Vattenfall v. Germany* tribunal clarified, this provision, which obliges the EU Member States to eliminate incompatibilities with other treaties, applies to the treaties which bind EU Member States to third countries.141 According to the Claimants, the Respondent admitted as much in the Rejoinder.142 In any event, Article 351 TFEU does not render incompatible provisions automatically inapplicable, but instead makes it incumbent upon the Member States to remedy such incompatibilities. In the present case, the Respondent has not done so before the Claimants accepted the offer to arbitrate. Given that an arbitration agreement was concluded, it is no longer open to the Respondent to renege on the offer.\n\n*Vattenfall v. Germany*, RL-22, \u00b6 225.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6 14, citing R-Rejoinder, \u00b6 109.\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimants further reject the Respondent's interpretation of the 2019 Declarations that the EU Member States issued as a result of the Achmea Decision. As a matter of public international law, these declarations are a non-binding expression of the States' intention to undertake future actions.143 They do not constitute joint interpretative statements or notes clarifying the meaning of Article 8 of the BIT and can certainly not remove the consent to arbitrate given in an international treaty. Even if the 2019 Declarations were considered to be joint interpretative statements, they would not be binding upon this Tribunal. Such statements are only one of the interpretative tools available under the VCLT. They fall under Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT which provides that in interpreting a treaty \"any subsequent agreement between the parties [\u2026] shall be taken into account.\" However, such interpretative agreements cannot change the plain ordinary meaning of the treaty text.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22, citing, *inter alia*, Shaw, *International Law,* (8th edition, Cambridge), CL-74, p. 88.\n\n197.\n\nIn connection with the Tribunal's question concerning the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the Claimants agree with the Respondent that jurisdiction must be assessed on the date of the commencement of the present proceedings.144 That said, they point to the Respondent's \"hypocritical\" position, which disregards events postdating the commencement of the arbitration, such as Brexit, and at the same time relies on other post-commencement events, such as the Achmea Decision and the 2019 Declarations.145\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6 37.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6 35.\n\n198.\n\nFinally, the Claimants insist that reasons of good faith and justice mandate the Tribunal to assume jurisdiction under Article 8 of the BIT. In particular, by statements (*e.g.*, \"the unexpected outcome in the Achmea decision\")146 and conduct (*e.g.*, failing to take any steps to amend, suspend or terminate Article 8 and electing not to file any equivalent jurisdictional objection in the *Accession v. Hungary* case filed in 2011 under the same BIT)147, the Respondent tacitly accepted that Article 8 of the BIT was still in force on the institution of these proceedings.\n\nRespondent's letter of 30 March 2018, C-133.\n\n*Accession Mezzanine Capital L.P. and Danubius Keresked\u00f6h\u00e1z Vagyonkezel\u00f6 Zrt. v.

Hungary*\"), RL-42.\n\n199.\n\nThus, so argue the Claimants, it would be manifestly unjust under the present facts if they were deprived of access to arbitral justice due to an alleged incompatibility between EU Treaties and the Respondent's unambiguous expression of consent in Article 8 of the BIT.148\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 70.\n\n**(3) Analysis**\n----------------\n\n200.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention requires *inter alia* that the respondent State and the national of another Contracting State consent in writing to arbitrate their dispute:\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, *which the parties to the dispute consent in writing* to submit to the Centre.149\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n201.\n\nWhen the Claimants served their request for arbitration on 4 July 2017, they purported to accept Hungary's offer to arbitrate which is embodied in Article 8 of the BIT and reads as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as \"the Centre\") for the settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any legal dispute arising under Article 6 of this Agreement between that Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the former.150\n\nUK-Hungary BIT, CL-1.\n\n202.\n\nHungary objects that, at the time of the Claimants' acceptance, the offer was no longer valid due to Hungary's accession to the EU Treaties in 2004.\n\n203.\n\nThe Parties agree that the question whether the EU Treaties override the dispute resolution clause of the BIT must be assessed under international law, and rightly so. Indeed, the BIT's offer to arbitrate is contained in an international treaty, and its validity and interpretation is governed by the VCLT of which Hungary and the UK are both contracting parties. In addition, this arbitration is conducted under the ICSID Convention and, thus, is not subject to a national legal system. As a result, the validity of the arbitration agreement or arbitrability of the dispute is not governed by a national *lex arbitri*. Therefore, for the purposes of the present case, the Tribunal does not need to consider the consequences, if any, of the application of a particular national *lex arbitri* to the dispute or the arbitration agreement.\n\n204.\n\nBefore analyzing whether the EU Treaties preclude the application of Article 8 of the BIT pursuant to the VCLT (c), the Tribunal will address the Respondent's argument that this Tribunal is bound by the Achmea Decision (a) and the 2019 Declarations (b).\n\n***a. Is the Achmea Decision binding on the Tribunal?***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nIn its judgment in *Achmea* issued on 6 March 2018, the CJEU held that \"Articles 267 and 344 [of the] TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States [...] under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.\"151\n\n*Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, Case C-284/16, Judgment of the Court (Grand Chamber), 6 March 2018, EU:C:2018:158, RL-12.\n\n206.\n\nAccording to Hungary, the Achmea Decision did not change the content of the existing law. Instead, \"[t]he Achmea Decision has only said what the law was all along.\"152 For the Respondent, since both Hungary and the UK empowered the CJEU to determine the interpretation and application of the EU Treaties and accepted to be bound by such determination, \"the Achmea Court's interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 is an authoritative interpretation\", with the result that \"as a matter of law, there is no scope for reinterpreting\".153\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 24:7-14.\n\nTranscript, Day 1, p. 22.\n\n207.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced that it is bound by the CJEU's decision over the conflict between the BIT and the EU Treaties. Under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, the UK, Hungary and the other 155 contracting States, including non-EU States, agreed that an arbitral tribunal constituted under the ICSID Convention \"shall be the judge of its own competence\", and that:\n\nAny objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, *shall be considered* by the Tribunal [\u2026].154\n\nEmphasis added.\n\n208.\n\nIn other words, the ICSID Convention empowers tribunals acting under its aegis to decide over their own jurisdiction, that is to say that it grants them *Kompetenz-Kompetenz*. In the exercise of such power, the Tribunal must analyze whether there is a valid consent to arbitrate under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. An ICSID tribunal cannot abandon this mandate and blindly follow the determination of another adjudicatory body. It must carry out its own analysis.\n\n209.\n\nIn any event, the CJEU's interpretative authority extends to the interpretation and application of the EU Treaties.155 The CJEU has no such (arguably) exclusive or ultimate mandate in respect of the interpretation of the BIT or the VCLT rules on treaty conflicts. Yet, in order to determine whether Article 8 of the BIT is precluded by the EU Treaties, it does not suffice to interpret the EU Treaties. This determination requires the interpretation of both the EU Treaties and the BIT, in order to answer crucial questions such as (i) whether the BIT and the EU Treaties govern the same subject matter as provided in Article 30 of the VCLT and, if so, (ii) whether there is a normative conflict between these treaties as understood under the VCLT.\n\n*Da Costa en Schaake N.V., Jacob Meijer N.V. and Hoechst-Holland N.V. v Nederlandse Belastingadministratie*, ECJ Cases 28, 29 and 30/62, 27 March 1963, RL-18.\n\n210.\n\nNot only does the CJEU have no exclusive authority to answer these questions, but it did not even purport to address them in the Achmea Decision. Even a cursory review of that decision reveals that the CJEU did not undertake a conflicts analysis under the VCLT. Thus, even if the Tribunal were willing to pay deference to the CJEU's reasoning, the Achmea Decision would give no guidance on the issues which must be resolved to determine whether the EU Treaties preclude the application of Article 8 of the BIT as a matter of international law. The Tribunal finds confirmation for this observation for instance in *United Utilities v. Estonia*, according to which the Achmea Decision \"assume[s] that the issue must be considered through, and only through, the lens of EU law.\"156\n\n*United Utilities (Tallinn) B.V. and Aktsiaselts Tallinna Vesi v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/24, Award, 21 June 2019 (\"*United Utilities v. Estonia*\"), \u00b6 539.\n\n211.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal is bound to undertake an independent analysis as to whether the EU Treaties override the consent to ICSID arbitration given in the BIT, which analysis is subject to the VCLT.\n\n***b. What is the value of the Member States Declarations?***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nIn January 2019, 23 EU Member States, including Hungary and the UK, made declarations affirming that \"all investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and thus inapplicable.\"157 The Parties dispute the legal value of the 2019 Declarations.\n\nDeclaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union (15 January 2019), RL-76; Declaration of the Representatives of the Government of Hungary on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union (16 January 2019), RL-77.\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Contracting States are the masters of the treaty. In general, the Tribunal agrees with this statement. Indeed, when the Contracting States are in agreement, they may even go as far as to terminate the treaty.158 That said, the UK and Hungary have not terminated the BIT pursuant to the rules of Section 3 of the VCLT. Even if they had done so by virtue of the 2019 Declarations, however, the Claimants accepted the BIT's offer to arbitrate prior to its purported termination. Pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, \"[w]hen the parties [i.e. the investor and the State] have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\" Indeed, it is common ground between the Parties that the relevant time for determining jurisdiction is the date of the initiation of the arbitration.\n\nArticle 54(b) of the VCLT.\n\n214.\n\nThus, the consent to arbitrate, in the sense of a meeting of the minds, which is perfected by the investor's acceptance of the State's offer to arbitrate expressed in the BIT would not be retroactively invalidated by a subsequent termination of the BIT. In other words, even if the Tribunal were to regard the 2019 Declarations as an agreement to terminate the BIT, *quod non*, that agreement could not have invalidated the consent to arbitrate because it was entered after the consent was formed.\n\n215.\n\nThe 2019 Declarations might also arguably be viewed as a \"subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty\", as envisaged by Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT. This seems to be the Respondent's position, which states that the 2019 Declarations are \"a clarification of the meaning and the effect that these [treaties] have always had. It is not a forward-looking policy statement [\u2026]. It is a statement of what they understand the law to have been since the treaties came into effect.\"159\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 35:22-36:6.\n\n216.\n\nHowever, the 2019 Declarations themselves are not clear on whether they purport to offer a joint interpretation of the intra-EU BITs. In pertinent part, their title reads: \"Declaration [\u2026] on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union.\"160 This wording suggests that the Member States seek to explain the legal consequences of the Achmea Decision, rather than to give an interpretation of the meaning of intra-EU investment treaties.\n\nDeclaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union (15 January 2019), RL-76; Declaration of the Representatives of the Government of Hungary on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union (16 January 2019), RL-77.\n\n217.\n\nThis suggestion is corroborated by the fact that, prior to the Achmea Decision, Hungary participated in an ICSID arbitration under the present BIT without objecting that Article 8 was extinguished due to its accession to the EU.161 This instance shows that Hungary did not consider that its offer to arbitrate expressed in the BIT had ceased to be effective as a result of its accession to the EU. Instead, as the title of the 2019 Declarations demonstrates, such ineffectiveness or extinguishment is presented as a consequence of the Achmea Decision. Yet, as discussed above, the Claimants accepted Hungary's offer to arbitrate prior to the Achmea Decision. Hence, according to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, it is no longer open for Hungary to renege on this consent.\n\n*Accession v. Hungary*, RL-42.\n\n218.\n\nBe that as it may, joint interpretative declarations or agreements are not an exclusive and dispositive method of treaty interpretation. Pursuant to Article 31(3) of the VCLT they are but one circumstance that \"shall be taken into account, together with the context\" of the relevant treaty terms. What is more, context is itself one of the means of interpretation under Article 31(1) of the VCLT, together with the ordinary meaning and object and purpose of the treaty. Thus, an interpretative declaration, as its name indicates, can only interpret the treaty terms; it cannot change their meaning:\n\nUnlike interpretation, the subsequent modification of a treaty can hardly be left to informal agreements as the amendment must be on the same legal level as the original treaty as foreseen in the treaty.162\n\nHafner, \"Subsequent Agreements and Practice: Between Interpretation, Informal Modification, and Formal Amendment\", in Nolte (Ed.) *Treaties and Subsequent Practice* (OUP 2013) 115; See also, D\u00f6rr, Schmalenbach, *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary* (Springer 2012) 553, \u00b6 73.\n\n219.\n\nHere, the provision that is purportedly subject to interpretation is Article 8 of the BIT, which was already quoted and reads as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as \"the Centre\") for the settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any legal dispute arising under Article 6 of this Agreement between that Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the former.163\n\nUK-Hungary BIT, CL-1.\n\n220.\n\nThe ordinary meaning of the language of this provision leaves no doubt that it contains binding consent (in the meaning of offer) to ICSID jurisdiction. The Respondent accepts the binding nature of this offer when it states in so many words that \"Hungary never denied that \"\u2018consents' means consents\"\" and that \"Hungary obviously intended to and did consent to the submission of disputes to ICSID arbitration when it signed the BIT.\"164 If Hungary and the UK intended to modify the words of an international treaty ratified by both of them, issuing an interpretative declaration by representatives of their governments was not a suitable means for achieving that purpose. If it had been their intent to amend the express language of the BIT, the States would have chosen a different course. The Member States obviously acknowledge that they cannot modify existing BITs by mere declarations, when they state in the 2019 Declarations:\n\nMember States will make best efforts to deposit their instrument of ratification, approval or acceptance [\u2026] of any bilateral investment treaty terminating bilateral investment treaties between Member States no later than 6 December 2019.165\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 55.\n\nDeclaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union (15 January 2019), RL-76; Declaration of the Representatives of the Government of Hungary on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in *Achmea* and on Investment Protection in the European Union (16 January 2019), RL-77.\n\n221.\n\nHad the 2019 Declarations been sufficient to change the BITs, then the termination of such treaties would be superfluous. In this respect, the Tribunal agrees with the ICSID tribunal in *United Utilities v. Estonia* that the language of the 2019 Declarations \"necessarily implies [\u2026] that the BIT remains in force and that its Article 9 [comparable to Article 8 here] can therefore constitute a valid offer to arbitrate, which Claimants accepted.\"166\n\n*United Utilities v. Estonia*, \u00b6 559.\n\n222.\n\nThe Tribunal's finding that the 2019 Declarations were not the proper procedure to terminate or amend the BIT is not based on mere formalism. The BIT is an international treaty that confers rights on private parties. While the Contracting States remain the masters of their treaty, their control is limited by the general principles of legal certainty and *res inter alios acta, aliis nec nocet nec prodest*.167 This is evident for instance from Article 13(3) of the BIT, which grants a guarantee of stability to investors who have made investments in reliance on the BIT:\n\nIn respect of investment made whilst the Agreement is in force, its provisions shall continue in effect with respect to such investments for a period of twenty years after the date of termination and without prejudice to the application thereafter of the rules of general international law.\n\nPursuant to Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT, treaties are to be interpreted in light of other rules of international law applicable between the parties. Pursuant to Article 38(1) of the ICJ Statute, this includes general principles of law; See also, Article 69(2) of the VCLT.\n\n223.\n\nThis provision shows that, even where the Contracting Parties terminate the treaty on mutual consent, they acknowledge that long-term interests of investors who have invested in the host State in reliance on the treaty guarantees must be respected. This is the purpose served by the 20-year sunset provision. If the protection of existing investments outlives an unambiguous termination of the Treaty, then the protection must continue *a fortiori* in respect of a decision of an adjudicatory body constituted under a different treaty or of declarations that purport to clarify the legal consequences of that decision.\n\n224.\n\nFor these reasons, the 2019 Declarations cannot retroactively invalidate or render inapplicable the offer to arbitrate that the Claimants accepted through their request for arbitration. That being said, it remains to be seen whether, by the time of the commencement of these proceedings, Article 8 of the BIT had been overridden as a consequence of Hungary's accession to the EU, pursuant to the conflict provisions of Article 30 of the VCLT.\n\n***c. Do the EU Treaties preclude the application of Article 8 of the BIT?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nIn reliance on the conflict rules of Article 30 of the VCLT, the Respondent argues that Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU override Article 8 of the BIT. The Claimants dispute the applicability of the conflict rules of Article 30 of the VCLT and submit that, even if they were applicable, the terms of the BIT would prevail.\n\n226.\n\nArticle 30 of the VCLT sets forth rules to resolve conflicts between successive treaties that govern the same subject matter. In relevant part, it reads as follows:\n\nArticle 30 Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter\n\n1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.\n\n2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.\n\n3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.\n\n4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one:\n\n(a) as between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in paragraph 3;\n\n(b) as between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs their mutual rights and obligations.\n\n227.\n\nIn order to determine whether the TFEU prevails over Article 8 of the BIT, the Tribunal must first answer two threshold questions: (i) do the BIT and the TFEU have the same subject matter as required by paragraph 1 of Article 30 of the VCLT and, if in the affirmative, (ii) is Article 8 of the BIT in conflict with Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU?\n\n**(i) Same subject matter**\n---------------------------\n\n228.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the interpretation of the same subject-matter requirement under Article 30(1) of the VCLT. According to most prominent commentators, the formulation should be understood widely.168 That being said, it cannot be reduced to a requirement that the two treaties be potentially applicable to the same set of circumstances. Such a reduction would render the requirement superfluous. Indeed, if two treaties do not apply to the same set of circumstances, they are not in conflict and Article 30 does not come into play.\n\nD\u00f6rr, Schmalenbach, *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary* (Springer, 2012) 510, \u00b6 12.\n\n229.\n\nTherefore, to satisfy the same subject-matter requirement, it does not suffice that the successive treaties potentially govern the same facts. This was the conclusion in *EURAM v. Slovak Republic* for instance:\n\nEven if two different rules deal with issues arising from the same facts, it does not necessarily mean that they have the same subject matter. This can be seen from a simple example: a treaty on environmental protection and a treaty on trade may both apply to the same factual situation but the subject matter with which they deal is quite different.169\n\n*European American Investment Bank AG (EURAM) v. Slovak Republic,* UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction, 22 October 2012, RL-8, \u00b6 169. The tribunal also warned that the ILC's interpretation conflates the same subject-matter requirement with the separate requirement of incompatibility.\n\n230.\n\nInvestment treaty tribunals have understood that the subject-matter of a treaty is defined by the matters with which the treaty's constituent provisions deal. In the words of the *Oostergetel* tribunal:\n\nThe requirement [\u2026] that the two treaties relate to the \"same subject matter\" has to be construed in line with the dominant view expressed in scholarly writings to the effect that two treaties can be considered to relate to the \"same subject matter\" only if the overall objective of these treaties is identical and they share a degree of general comparability.170\n\n*Oostergetel v. Slovakia*, \u00b6 79.\n\n231.\n\nIn respect of the EU Treaties, investment jurisprudence is consistent in holding that investment treaties do not share the subject matter with the EU Treaties. By contrast, the Achmea Decision is silent on whether the intra-EU investment treaties and the TFEU govern the same subject matter for the purposes of Article 30 of the VCLT.\n\n232.\n\nAmong investment awards, the *Wirtgen* tribunal found it \"obvious\" that intra-EU investment treaties and the TFEU did not relate to the same subject matter,171 and noted:\n\nTo take but one example, Article 10 of the Treaty allows an investor to sue a host state. No parallel provision exists in the TFEU. [\u2026] Similarly, EU law does not provide a protection similar to the FET found in the BIT.172\n\n*J\u00fcrgen Wirtgen, Stefan Wirtgen, Gisela Wirtgen and JSW Solar (zwei) GmbH & Co. KG v. Czech Republic,* PCA Case No. 2014-03, Final Award (\"*Wirtgen v. Czech Republic*\"), 11 October 2017, RL-10, \u00b6 253.\n\n*Wirtgen v. Czech Republic*, RL-10, \u00b6 253*.*\n\n233.\n\nEarlier, the *Eastern Sugar* tribunal had observed that \"the BIT [\u2026] provides for a special procedural protection in the form of arbitration between the investor state and the host state and, especially arbitration of a \u2018mixed' or \u2018diagonal' type between the investor and the host state\". That tribunal thus emphasized that \"[f]rom the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the arbitration clause is in practice the most essential provision of Bilateral Investment Treaties,\" and added that \"EU law does not provide such a guarantee.\"173\n\n*Eastern Sugar B.V. (Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic*, SCC Case No. 088/2004, Partial Award, 27 March 2007, CL-37, \u00b6\u00b6 164-165.\n\n234.\n\nIn addition, as the most evident distinction, the application of the BIT is contingent upon an investor of one State making a cross-border investment in the other State. In turn, the EU Treaties provide guarantees for nationals of the EU Member States irrespective of an investment. Due to this crucial distinction, the substantive protections afforded to a foreign investor under the Treaty are unsurprisingly not comparable to, or of the same nature as, those offered to EU nationals under the BIT. By way of an example, as the *Eureko v. Slovakia* tribunal observed, the protections afforded by BITs under the FET standard are not limited to the existing EU law provisions prohibiting discrimination.174 Similarly, while EU law may condition expropriatory takings upon public interest and fair compensation, it has not been established that it offers comparable protections to those available under the Treaty in case of indirect expropriations, or that it applies the protections to \"every kind of asset\".\n\n*Achmea B.V. v. The Slovak Republic*, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. 2008-13 (formerly Eureko B.V. v. The Slovak Republic), Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, 26 October 2010, RL-9, \u00b6 250.\n\n235.\n\nThe BIT and the EU Treaties also differ in their overarching goals. As the *Oostergetel* tribunal underscored, the EU Treaties' objective is to promote economic integration, including by creating a common market, among the Member States, whereas the objective of BITs (including the Treaty) is to provide for specific guarantees in order to encourage the international flows of investment into particular States.175\n\n*Oostergetel v. Slovakia*, \u00b6 75.\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no reason to diverge from the consistent line of investment awards according to which the EU Treaties and investment treaties do not share the same subject matter. Consequently, the conflict rules embodied in Article 30 of the VCLT do not apply to possible conflicts between the BIT and the EU Treaties.\n\n237.\n\nThe Parties have not pointed to, and the Tribunal is not aware of the existence of, provisions in the VCLT or of norms of customary international law that would govern the resolution of possible conflicts between successive treaties that *do not* share the same subject matter. Importantly, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the VCLT, \"[t]he validity of a treaty or of the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the application of the present Convention.\"\n\n238.\n\nFor these reasons, the conclusions that the BIT and the EU Treaties do not have the same subject matter and thus Article 30 of the VCLT does not apply dispose of the question whether the BIT's offer to arbitrate was valid and applicable at the commencement of this arbitration. The analysis could stop here. Yet, because the Parties have extensively briefed these issues, the Tribunal will review the existence of a conflict assuming same subject matter.\n\n**(ii) Conflict**\n-----------------\n\n239.\n\nEven if it were considered that the BIT and the EU Treaties share the same subject matter, the BIT's consent to arbitrate would not be precluded by operation of the EU Treaties, since there is no conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU.\n\n240.\n\nWhen States subscribe to successive treaties, without thereby terminating or amending any of them, it should be presumed that they did not intend to create a normative contradiction. This presumption of non-conflict derives from the principle of harmonious interpretation of international law:\n\nThere is a general principle under international law whereby the interpreter tries to smooth out or even to avoid conflict by way of \"harmonizing interpretation\" (presumption of non-conflict). This rule is based on the assumption that when States wanted different rules to be applicable they could not at the same time have wanted normative contradiction.176\n\nKolb, *The Law of Treaties: An Introduction* (Elgar, 2016) 183.\n\n241.\n\nAs a leading commentary to the VCLT suggests, \"[i]f apparently conflicting treaty provisions can be interpreted in such a way that they are compatible with each other, this approach is the first to be chosen.\"177 This harmonious interpretation should not be understood as a suggestion to ignore outright conflicts. An outright conflict \"arises only where a Party to the two treaties cannot simultaneously comply with its obligations under both treaties,\"178 or in different words:\n\nTreaties are incompatible with each other if their obligations cannot be complied with simultaneously, ie if a State Party to both treaties cannot comply with one of them without breaching the other.179\n\nD\u00f6rr, Schmalenbach, *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary* (Springer, 2012) 511, \u00b6 13.\n\nJenks, *The Conflict of Law-Making Treaties* (BYIL, 1951) 403.\n\nD\u00f6rr, Schmalenbach, *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties: A Commentary* (Springer, 2012) 511, \u00b6 13.\n\n242.\n\nBearing these explanations in mind, the Tribunal fails to see a conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU. Article 344 reads as follows:\n\nMember States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for [in the Treaties].\n\n243.\n\nThe language of this provision does not limit or prohibit the submission of disputes with investors based on an investment treaty to other adjudicatory bodies. Instead, it limits the power of the Member States to litigate (or arbitrate) disputes concerning the interpretation or application of the EU Treaties by means other than those provided in the EU Treaties.\n\n244.\n\nIn line with this distinction, Article 8 of the BIT provides for international arbitration of disputes \"arising under Article 6 [of the BIT]\", not of \"a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the [EU] Treaties\". It is true that a dispute arising under Article 6 of the BIT may involve, as preliminary or incidental issues, matters calling for the interpretation or application of the EU Treaties. At most, one might argue that Article 344 of the TFEU carves out from the subject-matter scope of Article 8 of the BIT potential investment disputes that also involve \"interpretation or application of the [EU] Treaties\". The Tribunal can leave this question open as the present dispute does not call for the interpretation or application of the EU Treaties. Therefore, at the time when the Claimants commenced these proceedings, the BIT's offer to arbitrate was valid in respect of the subject-matter scope of the present dispute.\n\n245.\n\nThe next provision that the Respondent considers to be in conflict with Article 8 of the BIT is Article 267 of the TFEU, which reads as follows:\n\nThe Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning:\n\n(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;\n\n(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union.\n\n246.\n\nHere the potential for a normative conflict is even more remote. This provision confers the power to give preliminary rulings on the CJEU. It is unclear how this power conflicts with the submission of a dispute under a BIT to international arbitration. It is true that an investment treaty tribunal is not empowered to resort to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. This alone does not give rise to a normative conflict with Article 267. Indeed, the language of Article 267 does not create an obligation for the Member States to ensure that each and every adjudicatory body potentially applying EU law may seek a preliminary ruling from the CJEU. Even at the level of the domestic courts of the EU Member States, there is no such obligation. In addition, if that were the meaning of Article 267, the Member States would violate Article 267 by allowing commercial arbitration as well as arbitration under extra-EU investment treaties, since arbitral tribunals constituted under these mechanisms may be called upon to apply EU law and have no standing to request preliminary rulings.\n\n247.\n\nIn any event, as with Article 344, resorting to the principle of harmonious interpretation, Article 267 might at most be understood as a carve out \u2013 as opposed to a complete preclusion \u2013- from the subject-matter scope of Article 8 of the BIT in respect of disputes that relate to the interpretation of the EU Treaties, or the validity and interpretation of acts of the EU institutions. Here again, the Tribunal leaves this issue open as the present dispute does not fall in that category.\n\n248.\n\nFor these reasons, subject to the Respondent's objection to the subject-matter jurisdiction, which will be addressed next, the Tribunal concludes that at the time of the initiation of these proceedings the BIT's offer to arbitrate was standing and that a valid arbitration agreement was formed when the Claimants accepted this offer, thus creating the consent to arbitrate required under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. SUBJECT-MATTER JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nIt is common ground that the Claimants' farming business in Hungary constitutes an investment within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. The Parties disagree, however, on whether the consent to arbitrate \"any legal dispute arising under Article 6 [the expropriation provision]\" of the BIT extends to the present dispute and, in particular, whether Hungary's measures were capable of constituting an expropriation of the assets constituting an investment.\n\n**(1) The Respondent's Position**\n---------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the present dispute does not fall within the subject-matter scope of the BIT's dispute resolution provision, since none of the conduct alleged by the Claimants is capable of constituting an expropriation.\n\n251.\n\nFirst, although the Claimants' farming business in Hungary indisputably constitutes an investment,180 the farm as a whole is not the subject of the expropriation claim, since the Claimants continue to derive profit from it.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 253.\n\n252.\n\nSecond, the Lease cannot be the subject of an expropriation either, because it expired on 25 July 2014 on its own terms.181 In this respect, the Respondent counters the Claimants' submission that a new lease was formed by virtue of their exercise of the alleged pre-lease right on 29 April 2014. At that time, so says the Respondent, the Claimants no longer possessed a contractual pre-lease right as it was extinguished by the 2006 Lease Amendment.\n\n2006 Lease Agreement, C-40, Section 4.\n\n253.\n\nIn any event, as the Respondent's legal expert Professor Menyh\u00e1rd explains, the exercise of a pre-lease right does not automatically result in the conclusion of a new lease. For that result to ensue two conditions must be met: (i) the lessee who purports to exercise the pre-lease right must demonstrate that he/she is capable of performing the lease under the terms offered by the relevant third party and (ii) no lease contract must yet be concluded with a *bona fide* third party.182 The Claimants' purported exercise of the pre-lease right on 29 April 2014 met none of these conditions. Thus, at most, In\u00edcia only possessed a right to seek damages from the NLA for breach of contract.183\n\nMenyh\u00e1rd Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 41-50.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 192.\n\n254.\n\nThird, the alleged pre-lease right and right to claim damages for the conduct of the Tenders do not constitute an investment under the BIT and are thus not capable of being expropriated. In particular, pre-lease rights, being non-transferable184 and lacking intrinsic value, do not constitute \"assets\" within the meaning of the definition of investment contained in Article 1 of the BIT. In the proper context and in light of the object and purpose of the BIT, the term \"asset\" should be understood to denote proprietary rights. This understanding is confirmed by the arbitral jurisprudence185 and legal scholars.186\n\nSection 373(4) of the 1959 Civil Code explicitly renders the transfer of a pre-emption right \"null and void\". Under, Section 373(5), pre-emption rights, and hence pre-lease rights, \"do not pass onto successors\". The Parties' experts are in agreement that rules concerning pre-emption rights in the 1959 Civil Code apply *mutatis mutandis* to pre-lease rights.

The Respondent argues that under Hungarian constitutional law, \"a pre-lease right does not belong to the core of the content of a lease contract: it does not provide the right to acquire a lease.\"187 Thus, as Professor Menyh\u00e1rd opines, even if a lease were to enjoy constitutional protection as property under certain circumstances, it does not automatically follow that such protection extends to pre-lease rights.188\n\nRejoinder, para. 213, referring to Constitutional Court 16/2015 (VI.5.) AB hat, 5 June 2015, R-16, \u00b6 128.\n\nMenyh\u00e1rd Second ER, \u00b6 9.\n\n256.\n\nIn addition, continues the Respondent, the notice for the Tenders expressly stated that \"no pre-lease right can be exercised in connection with the tender.\"189 By taking part in the Tenders, the Claimants accepted these terms. As the Constitutional Court held in a case involving strikingly similar circumstances, a lease holder's participation in the tender under such terms undermines his alleged \"entitlement to property\" with respect to the land.190\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 216.\n\nRuling no. 3129/2018 (IV. 9.) AB of the Constitutional Court, R-29.\n\n257.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the alleged right to damages arising out of the Tenders does not constitute an asset qualifying as an investment and being susceptible of being expropriated. An unadjudicated claim, even if founded, has no ascertained monetary value and is not transferable. Therefore it does not constitute assets.191 In *Emmis v. Hungary*, the ICSID tribunal determined that \"[i]t is the asset itself \u2013 the property interest or chose in action \u2013 and not its contractual source that is the subject of the expropriation claim.\"192 In any event, the measures complained of are not an expropriation of a damages claim that may result from the Claimants' loss of the Land following the Tenders. Indeed, the Claimants do not allege that Hungary passed legislation preventing them from pursuing their claim for damages. These alleged claims are not therefore in dispute and cannot serve as the basis for the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nDouglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims*, (Cambridge University Press, 2009), RL-4, \u00b6\u00b6 434-435.\n\n*Emmis v. Hungary*, RL-37, \u00b6 169.\n\n258.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that the alleged pre-lease rights and the claims arising under the Tenders do not qualify as investments within the meaning of the ICSID Convention, as they do not bear the hallmarks of an investment.193 They do not involve (i) a commitment of resources, (ii) over a certain duration, (iii) involving a risk and (iv) making a contribution to the host State's economic development. The Claimants' position that the term \"investment\" has no independent meaning under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is untenable as demonstrated by a wealth of ICSID awards.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 368-369, 381-382.\n\n259.\n\nFor these reasons, the Respondent maintains that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the present dispute.\n\n**(2) The Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the investment for present purposes is constituted of the leasehold rights over the Land, which \"comprise a lease (created as a result of the exercise of the contractual pre-lease right on 29 April 2014), a contractual pre-lease right, a statutory pre-lease right and a right to damages arising from the manipulated tender scoring\".194\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 98.\n\n261.\n\nFirst, the Claimants counter the Respondent's argument that the Lease expired on its own terms. According to the Claimants, a new lease was created in April 2014, when In\u00edcia exercised the contractual pre-lease right.195 The NLA's conclusion of a competing lease with the winners of the Tenders, who were acting in good faith, does not alter the fact that under the rules governing the pre-emption and pre-lease rights, In\u00edcia's exercise of the pre-lease right resulted in a new lease. In such case, as Professor Menyh\u00e1rd himself explains in his scholarly writings, \"the contracts concluded one after the other represent equal ranking obligations.\"196 If the obligor chooses to perform one of the conflicting contracts to the detriment of the other, it owes damages to the creditor of the latter contract, being understood that both contracts are valid and enforceable. The Respondent's position that In\u00edcia's exercise of the pre-lease right did not result in the creation of a new lease because of the NLA's choice to lease the Land to others is therefore unsupported by the applicable rules.197\n\nCM, \u00b6 79.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6 48, citing Menyh\u00e1rd, \"Law of things\", ELTE E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Kiad\u00f3 (Budapest, 2014), p. 130, filed as C-137 refiled with completed translation as C-239.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 47-56.\n\n262.\n\nSecond, the Claimants argue that the definition of \"investment\" agreed between the parties in the BIT governs as *lex specialis*. This definition, according to the Claimants, \"is both the starting and the end point for the Tribunal's determination of what constitutes an 'investment' for the purposes of these proceedings.\"198 The ICSID Convention is deliberately silent on the definition of investment, so that the BIT parties could give their own definition.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 106.\n\n263.\n\nIn any event, the *Salini* criteria to which the Respondent refers should not be regarded as jurisdictional requirements but merely as typical characteristics of investments under the ICSID Convention.\n\n264.\n\nThird, for the Claimants, their leasehold rights fall within the definition of investment in the BIT. In particular, the ordinary meaning of the word \"asset\" used in Article 1 of the BIT is not limited to rights *in rem*. ICSID tribunals and scholars widely opine that *in personam* rights can also qualify as investments under categories such as \"claims to money and other assets or to any performance under contract having a financial value\",199 and thus be expropriated.200 Indeed, the Claimants' right to use and collect the proceeds of the Land pursuant to the Lease, as it arises from the Hungarian Civil Code,201 is a claim under a contract having financial value.\n\nUK-Hungary BIT, Article 1, CL-1.\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v.

This approach is shared by investment tribunals, which have held that \"the notion of property or assets is not to be narrowly circumscribed\" and rights that are not traditionally regarded as *in rem* rights should also be \"protected from expropriation\".205\n\nHalmai First ER, \u00b6 54.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 133, citing Constitutional Case No. 64/1993 (XII.22), VI. 2. a), cited at fn 106 of C-Reply.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 136.\n\n*Emmis v. Hungary*, RL-37, \u00b6 163.\n\n266.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, their leasehold rights have the functional characteristics of property. First and foremost, they incorporate a right to possession, which is a fundamental component of property opposable to the public as a whole, including the lessor himself.206 In addition, a lease is transferable, albeit by consent of the lessor.207 It does not terminate upon the death of the lessee and passes to the heirs.208 Nor is the lease terminated by a change of lessor.209 In any event, if the Respondent insists on a narrow category of *in rem* rights, then the Claimants contend that the right to possess the Land that derives from the Lease and the leasehold rights, is the subject of the expropriation claim.210\n\nCM, \u00b6 118, C-Reply, \u00b6 151.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 147, see, fn 120.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 148.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 149; Halmai First ER, p. 9.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 151.\n\n267.\n\nAs for the pre-lease rights, the Civil Law Chamber of the Supreme Court211 as well as Hungarian scholars consider that a \"pre-emption right based on statute necessarily has an *in rem* effect, because, as a result of its very nature, it obliges the owner or right holder of the asset at issue at all time.\"212 Both the Lease and the pre-lease right contained within the Lease are thus investments capable of expropriation.\n\nOpinion 2/2009 (VI. 24.)

In that case, the applicant leaseholder challenged the results of a tender by which it had lost the leased land. The Constitutional Court dismissed the application on the grounds that (i) the previous lease which was for a limited term had expired, (ii) that lease could not have been transformed into a lease for an indefinite term, and (iii) the applicant had no pre-lease right.213 If anything, this reasoning implies that, had there been a pre-lease right, the applicant would have held a constitutionally protected property right.214 It is thus unsurprising that the Respondent's own expert does not rely on this decision.\n\nRuling no. 3129/2018 (IV. 9.) AB of the Constitutional Court, R-29.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6 78.\n\n269.\n\nFifth, the Claimants assert that the pre-lease right is a transferable right that has an intrinsic financial value. In particular, under the Civil Code, a pre-lease right can be transferred by appointment of a third party to exercise the right. Such appointment differs from an assignment, which, as the Respondent points out, is null and void.215 An appointment does not require the owner's consent, and often third parties are prepared to pay for the appointment allowing them to exercise the pre-emption or pre-lease rights.216 In addition, a pre-lease right passes on to the legal successors of its holder together with the lease.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6 80.\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6 81.\n\n270.\n\nFinally, the Claimants' loss of the Land as a result of the manipulated tender scores is actionable under Hungarian law in the form of a damages claim, *i.e.,* a chose-in-action, which is a form of intangible property.217 This claim is a further right that can be expropriated.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 169.\n\n**(3) Analysis**\n----------------\n\n271.\n\nThe scope of the Tribunal's jurisdiction is set out in Articles 25 of the ICSID Convention and 8.1 of the BIT, which read as follows:\n\nArticle 25\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nArticle 8.1\n\nEach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter referred to as \"the Centre\") for the settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any legal dispute *arising under Article 6* [expropriation provision] of this Agreement between that Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party *concerning an investment* of the latter in the territory of the former.218\n\nUK-Hungary BIT, CL-1, emphases added.\n\n272.\n\nThree jurisdictional requirements related to the subject matter of the dispute derive from these provisions:\n\n\u2022 The dispute must arise directly out of an investment (Article 25 of the ICSID Convention);\n\n\u2022 The dispute must \"concern the investment\" (Article 8.1 of the BIT);\n\n\u2022 The dispute must arise under Article 6, which is the expropriation provision of the BIT (Article 8.1 of the BIT).\n\n273.\n\nThe first two requirements appear met. The Parties do not dispute that the Claimants' farm is an investment within the meaning of both the ICSID Convention and the BIT. The present dispute, which concerns the alleged expropriation of the Claimants' leasehold rights, does arise out of that overall investment of the Claimants.\n\n274.\n\nIt is well established in the investment treaty jurisprudence that, for purposes of subject-matter jurisdiction, the existence of an investment must be assessed holistically. So, for instance, in the words of the *Holiday Inns v. Morocco* tribunal:\n\n[I]nvestment is accomplished by a number of juridical acts of all sorts. It would not be consonant either with economic reality or with the intention of the parties to consider each of these acts in complete isolation from the others.219\n\n*Holiday Inns, Occidental Petroleum and others v. Kingdom of Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1, Decision on Problems Raised with Regard to the Connections between the Basic Agreement and the Loan Contracts, 12 May 1974, p. 3.\n\n275.\n\nSimilarly, in *Inmaris v. Ukraine*, the tribunal held that \"[f]or purposes of this Tribunal's jurisdiction [\u2026] the Tribunal need only determine the existence of a covered investment in the transaction as a whole.\"220 In addition, in *CSOB v. Slovak Republic*, the tribunal found that a dispute related to a loan agreement fell within its jurisdiction, since the loan was part of a broader consolidation transaction, which qualified as an investment.221 Had the tribunal singled out the loan agreement, it would likely not have deemed it an investment and would have declined jurisdiction.\n\n*Inmaris Perestroika Sailing Maritime Services GmbH and others v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 March 2010, CL-52, \u00b6 92.\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v. The Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, RL-1.\n\n276.\n\nIn other words, the Tribunal should look at the investment as a whole and ascertain whether the dispute has a sufficiently direct link with the overall investment. This is clearly the case here, where the dispute arises directly out of the activities of the Farm.\n\n277.\n\nAs for the third requirement, Article 8 of the BIT requires that there be \"a legal dispute arising under Article 6\". According to the definition given by the PCIJ in *Mavrommatis*, under international law \"[a] dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.\"222 The ICJ also defines a legal dispute broadly as \"a situation in which the two sides hold clearly opposite views concerning the question of the performance or non-performance of certain treaty obligations.\"223\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v. Great Britain)*, Judgment of 30 August 1924, 1924 PCIJ Series A, No. 2, p. 11.\n\n*Interpretation of the Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania*, Advisory Opinion, 30 March 1950 (first phase), ICJ Reports (1950) 65, at 74.\n\n278.\n\nHence, for the Tribunal to have subject-matter jurisdiction under Article 8 of the BIT, it must be satisfied that the Parties are in \"disagreement on a point of law or fact\" concerning Hungary's performance or non-performance under Article 6 of the BIT. When assessing this requirement, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to establish whether the Claimants' assets have actually been expropriated. It is in the nature of a dispute that it may eventually be decided against the Claimants.\n\n279.\n\nHungary argues that, by the time of the alleged measures, the Claimants no longer held any leasehold rights capable of being expropriated. The Claimants object that they had leasehold rights, which were in fact expropriated by the Respondent's measures, including the 2011 Amendment. For the purposes of its jurisdictional inquiry, the Tribunal need not go further. This disagreement is precisely a \"legal dispute arising under Article 6\" over which the Parties conferred jurisdiction to this Tribunal. In other words, the jurisdictional requirement is fulfilled and the Tribunal must decide this dispute on the merits.\n\n280.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that its jurisdiction pursuant to Article 8 is restricted to reviewing whether there is a breach of Article 6 of the BIT. The Tribunal will not inquire into breaches of other rules of the BIT or international law. In other words, the effect of the subject-matter limitation of Article 8 of the BIT is that the Tribunal will scrutinize the Respondent's measures through narrow lenses that limit its vision to alleged violations of Article 6. In doing so, the Tribunal gives effective meaning to the subject-matter limitation of Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n281.\n\nIn conclusion, the disagreement on whether the Claimants held rights capable of being expropriated and whether Hungary's measures were expropriatory constitutes \"a legal dispute arising under Article 6\" of the BIT. It thus falls within the Tribunal's jurisdiction pursuant to Article 8 of the BIT.\n\n**V. LIABILITY**\n----------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether the Respondent's conduct constituted an expropriation of the Claimants' investment. It is the Claimants' position that Hungary acting through the NLA expropriated In\u00edcia's leasehold rights. By contrast, the Respondent submits that the actions of the NLA were not sovereign acts but were contractual in nature, and therefore not treaty violations. It further opposes the expropriation claim on the ground that In\u00edcia did not hold rights capable of being expropriated, and that Hungary's conduct was in any event an exercise of regulatory police powers that is not compensable under international law.\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimants submit that Hungary's measures were sovereign acts attributable to Hungary (1), which resulted in an expropriation of the Claimants' leasehold rights, including the contractual and statutory pre-lease rights as well as the new 20-year lease that was concluded upon In\u00edcia's exercise of the pre-lease right in April 2014 (2). They object to the Respondent's police powers defense and argue that Hungary's measures were arbitrary and discriminatory, as they were motivated by political favoritism and thinly veiled xenophobia (3).\n\n**(1) Hungary exercised sovereign powers**\n------------------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nThe Claimants first point out that one of the key acts which they challenge and which resulted in the expropriation of the statutory pre-lease right was the 2011 Amendment, which is a legislative Act passed by Parliament. As such, it indisputably constitutes sovereign conduct attributable to Hungary.\n\n285.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants' physical eviction from the Land was carried out with direct participation of the State. The contract that the NLA signed with the private security guards shows that the NLA was contracting as a representative of the State.224 Dr. Bitay, State Secretary at the Ministry of Agriculture, confirmed in his witness statement that he personally arranged the physical eviction of the Claimants as the representative of the State.225 By this admission, the State has embraced the NLA's conduct as its own, pursuant to Article 11 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility (the \"**ILC Articles**\").\n\nContract with Private Security Guards, C-181.\n\nBitay First WS, \u00b6 29.\n\n286.\n\nIn addition, as Section 3 of the NLA Act shows, the NLA is nothing but an instrumentality of the Hungarian Minister of Agriculture:\n\nThe minister in charge of the agricultural sector (hereinafter referred to as \"minister\") shall exercise ownership rights and discharge obligations in connection with the National Land Fund in the name and on behalf of the Hungarian State through the [NLA].226\n\nAct LXXXVII of 2010 on the National Land Fund, 23 May 2013, R-13, Section 3.\n\n287.\n\nThe NLA is set up as a so-called \"central budgetary organ\", as opposed to a corporation, foundation, association or other civil or corporate law entity.227 Its officials are public servants who are under a duty to make public disclosure about their finances, which are reviewed by the State audit office.228\n\nAct LXXXVII of 2010 on the National Land Fund, 23 May 2013, R-13, Section 4.1.\n\nDeed of foundation of the NLA, C-187; Bylaws of the NLA, C-188.\n\n288.\n\nIn addition, Hungary exercises close control over the NLA, which includes the right to issue the Deed of Foundation and the bylaws of the NLA; to approve the bylaws of the Council of the NLA; to appoint the Chairman and, upon the motion of the latter, the Deputy Chairmen of the NLA; to appoint the Chairman and the Members of the NLA Council; to approve the NLA's yearly plan and to submit to the government for approval the NLA's mid-term strategic plan relating to the use and exploitation of the assets of the NLA; and to decide upon the financial appropriations relating to the budget of the NLA. According to the Claimants, there is thus no doubt that the NLA's conduct is attributable to Hungary.\n\n289.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants contend that the management of State land is not a commercial activity and that the Respondent itself admits it when arguing that the NLA's conduct was in line with the State's social policy in the field of agriculture.229 Hungary cannot have it both ways. If it intends to defend the NLA's conduct on the basis that it formed part of the implementation of the Respondent's social policies, it cannot at the same time, so say the Claimants, argue that the NLA merely engages in the commercial management of State land. When the NLA defines the tender rules in order to implement the State landholding policies, it exercises public authority and fulfils a public function.230\n\nCiting RCM, \u00b6 510.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 203.\n\n290.\n\nTherefore, in the Claimants' submission, the cancellation of In\u00edcia's statutory pre-lease right, the manipulation of the tender scores, the failure to publish or communicate the winning bids to the Claimants, the purported transfer of possession of the Land in October 2014, and the physical eviction of the Claimants from the Land in July 2015 using private armed security guards are far from being simple contractual breaches as they involve the exercise of sovereign powers.231\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 208.\n\n**(2) Hungary expropriated the contractual pre-lease right**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent's conduct amounted to expropriation of their leasehold rights, including the contractual and statutory pre-lease rights and the renewed 20-year lease which they obtained in July 2014, as well as the statutory pre-lease right, which the 2011 Amendment rendered nugatory.\n\n292.\n\nIn respect of the contractual pre-lease right, the Claimants request the Tribunal to discard the Metropolitan Court's decision of 7 December 2017, which erroneously held that the 2006 Lease Amendment granted no contractual pre-lease right to In\u00edcia.\n\n293.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Metropolitan Court's judgment contradicted the practice of other lower courts holding that the standard language of Section 5.1 of the 2006 Lease Amendment did grant contractual pre-lease rights. Panel V of the Curia, Hungary's highest court, had sustained this interpretation in the so called *Gyula* case.232 This is the same panel that remanded In\u00edcia's case to the Metropolitan Court for lack of sufficient reasons. The Metropolitan Court chose to rely on the interpretation given by another panel of the Curia, Panel VI, and to declare that Section 5.1 of the Lease (as amended by the 2006 Lease Amendment) did not provide a contractual pre-lease right. In doing so, the Metropolitan Court failed to address several crucial arguments of In\u00edcia.\n\nJudgment of the Curia (No. Pfv.V.22.072/2015/6), 2 March 2016 (\"the Gyula Case\"), C-113.\n\n294.\n\nIn particular, the Metropolitan Court did not apply the rule *contra proferentem* set out in Section 207(2) of the Civil Code. The NLA drafted the disputed pre-lease provision of the 2006 Lease Amendment, which it used as a standard term for numerous leases of State-owned land. Thus, under the principle *contra proferentem*, any ambiguity in the pre-lease provision had to be interpreted against the NLA. The very fact that different courts reached different outcomes when interpreting the pre-lease provision proves the ambiguity. In addition, the provision meets all the criteria for the application of Section 207(2) of the Civil Code as (i) it was defined unilaterally by the NLA as a standard term; (ii) the NLA used the same term for more than one lease agreement with different lessees; and (iii) In\u00edcia has not participated in an individual negotiation of the pre-lease provision.\n\n295.\n\nIn respect of the last element, the Claimants clarify that, although In\u00edcia had an opportunity to familiarize itself with the terms of the draft 2006 Lease Amendment, this does not mean that the relevant contractual provisions were not standard terms for the purposes of the *contra proferentem* rule. The requirement that the other party have an opportunity to familiarize itself with the standard term is a condition for the standard term to become part of the parties' agreement (Section 205.B.1 of the Civil Code). It says nothing about whether the term in question is a standard term (Section 205.A.1). A term is standard when it was drafted by one party and not negotiated. This is the test for the application of the *contra proferentem* rule.\n\n296.\n\nIn addition, according to the Claimants, if the Respondent is right that the 2006 wording of the pre-lease provision removed the contractual pre-lease right that existed in the 1999 version of the Lease, then this removal must be regarded as a surprise term. According to Section 205.B.2 of the Civil Code, surprise terms do not become part of the contract, unless they have been specifically notified. The Claimants received no such notification. Therefore, the removal of the contractual pre-lease right, if this indeed was the effect of Section 5.1 of the 2006 Lease Amendment, meant that the change never became part of the agreement, and that the previous version of the contract that included the contractual pre- lease right continued to apply.\n\n297.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants validly exercised their contractual pre-lease right by a notice of 29 April 2014, resulting in the conclusion of a new lease agreement. The Respondent refused to give effect to the valid exercise of the Claimants' rights and eventually physically evicted the Claimants from the Land. These actions constitute an expropriation of the Claimants' contractual pre-lease right and of the new lease that was entered into as a result of the valid exercise of that right.\n\n**(3) Hungary expropriated the statutory pre-lease right**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants argue that, even if they had no contractual pre-lease right, the Respondent expropriated their statutory pre-lease right by passing the 2011 Amendment, which prohibited its exercise in the context of NLA tenders. According to the Claimants, the pre-lease right that the legislation conferred on lessees of agricultural land was a vested right, guaranteeing legal certainty in order to induce investment. According to Professor Halmai, the 2011 Amendment was unconstitutional as it \"deprived lessees of their acquired right to renew their leases without appropriate transitory rules or compensation\".233\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6288.\n\n299.\n\nThe Claimants oppose Professor Menyh\u00e1rd's interpretation of the Constitutional Court Decision in Case No. 16/2015, where the court held that the 2011 Amendment did not violate the principle of freedom of contract under the Constitution. According to the Claimants, this ruling determined that the 2011 Amendment was not a violation of the right to property, although this issue was not put to the court.234 The only two judges on the court appointed before Fidesz's return to power issued a joint dissent. They held that the statutory pre-lease rights had been acquired \"at the time of the execution of the lease contracts\" and that they \"had a concrete, quantifiable value\", with the result that \"depriving the lessees from this right, as an already acquired right, without compensation violates the principle of legal certainty, which is the theoretical basis of the protection of acquired rights\".235\n\nC-Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 68-74.\n\nConstitutional Court Decision 16/2015, C-192.\n\n**(4) Hungary's measures were not a lawful exercise of police powers**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants dispute the Respondent's police powers defense. According to them, the doctrine of police powers applies in a limited set of circumstances and only in the context of regulatory expropriation, which is a form of indirect expropriation. Here, the Respondent directly expropriated the Claimants' rights, both by removing the leasehold rights and by physically seizing the Land. Thus, the doctrine of police powers is of no avail to Hungary.\n\n301.\n\nIn addition, so say the Claimants, Hungary's measures served none of the grounds justifying the exercise of police powers, as they were not taken to protect public order and morality, human health or the environment. Even if they did, it would not absolve Hungary from the obligation to pay compensation for the expropriation. As the tribunal in *Pope & Talbot v. Canada* observed, \"a blanket exception for regulatory measures would create a gaping loophole in international protections against expropriation.\"\n\n302.\n\nIn any event, for the Claimants, the Respondent cannot validly invoke the police powers defense since it expropriated the Claimants' leasehold rights in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. In particular, the 2011 Amendment nullified the pre-lease rights only in respect of tenders of State-owned land and not private land. If the government really aimed at promoting local and family farms, the policy should have applied to the leases of private land as well. The reason why the Government rid itself of existing acquired rights of incumbent lessees of State-owned land was political favoritism, a phenomenon which the Claimants describe by reference to a book published by Professor J\u00f3szef \u00c1ngy\u00e1n, who resigned from the government in protest in 2012. Professor \u00c1ngy\u00e1n writes about what he calls the post-soviet mafia State set up by the Fidesz government. Among other examples, Professor \u00c1ngy\u00e1n mentions that the sister-in-law of the Prime Minister's daughter won each of the tenders in which she bid because she was conveniently awarded much higher \"subjective points\" than other bidders for her business plan despite her low \"objective points\", or that the Prime Minister's childhood friend, Mr. L\u0151rinc M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros, a former gas fitter and now Hungary's second richest man, owned no land in 2010 and now owns or leases over 36,000 hectares of agricultural land through family members and related companies.236\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 306; Financial Time Article 21 December 2017, C-194.\n\n303.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, contrary to Hungary's rhetoric that the land reform aimed at making the land available to local family farmers, only a minority of leases were in fact awarded to locals. The Respondent's reliance on the fact that the average surface area of the leases was 24.81 hectares is misleading. Behind this average there is an extremely unequal distribution where the top 1.9% of the winners were awarded 24-25% of the land and the top 0.4% of winners obtained 11% of the land. In addition, a significant portion of the State-owned land was leased to favored individuals without a tender.237\n\nReport of Dr. J\u00f3zsef \u00c1ngy\u00e1n of 1 January 2014, C-67.\n\n304.\n\nThe Claimants suggest that the Fidesz government deliberately acted with the covert agenda of political favoritism. When the Parliament passed the 2011 Amendment, the opposition harshly criticized the almost unfettered discretion that the NLA was accorded in distributing State-owned land by using the subjective scoring element for the \"professional and commercial well-foundedness of the business plan\".238 Tellingly, the Claimants lost the Tenders precisely due to their low scores in this entirely subjective component of the scoring system.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 300.\n\n305.\n\nBy contrast, the owner of a sister farm similar to that of the Claimants, Mr. Lorant Szasko, who is a founding member of the Fidesz party, won all 25 tenders that the NLA announced on his land. Were it not for the high subjective scores he received for his business plan, he would have lost 22 out of the 25 tenders.\n\n306.\n\nDismayed with the public scrutiny, on 25 May 2013, Hungary amended the NLA Decree whereby, after awarding a lease, the NLA returned every bid to the bidders, with the exception of the winning bid, thereby rendering it impossible to make any comparison of the scoring of the bids.239 The Respondent also eliminated the requirement to aggregate the landholdings of family members and related companies when calculating an individual's compliance with the legal maximum landholding, paving the way for the favored families to appropriate large tracts of land.\n\nSection 23A of the NLA Tender Decree, C-60.\n\n307.\n\nIn this respect, the Claimants allege that they \"are aware, from their local knowledge, that several of the 'winners' of their tenders use and/or own large tracts of agricultural land through their families and related companies.\"240 In the document production phase, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to produce extracts from the Land Use Register and the Land Registry showing the total agricultural land used and/or owned by these winners and their families and companies. However, the Respondent failed to comply. According to the Claimants, \"[t]he inference to be drawn is obvious\".241\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 313, citing Hunter Second WS, \u00b6 16; Minimum aggregate land holding estimates for certain winners of the tenders, C-197.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 313; Claimants' email of 4 December 2018.\n\n308.\n\nFurthermore, it is the Claimants' submission that the government officials implementing Hungary's land policies did not veil their xenophobic motives, making statements such as: \"we will protect Hungarian agricultural lands\"242 and \"ensure that farmland, be it leased or owned, remains with Hungarian people\";243 \"whoever owns the land owns the country\";244 and referring to \"the battle against foreign penetration\".245\n\nVideo footage and Ministry of Agriculture Press Release of July 2015, C-24.\n\nPublic Statement of Dr. Fazekas in February 2014, C-69.\n\nNLA website, Greeting by Dr. Fazekas, July 2015, C-18.\n\nNLA website, Greeting by Dr. Fazekas, July 2015, C-18.\n\n309.\n\nNor were the Claimants afforded due process in the course of the expropriation. Besides being denied the opportunity to consult crucial tender documentation until ordered by this Tribunal, the Respondent handled the Claimants' physical eviction from the Land in disregard of its own laws, without giving a fair notice and using private security guards hired by the NLA, all despite the possessory protection orders that the Claimants had obtained from the local courts.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the expropriation claim. It submits that one category of the impugned measures \u2013 the alleged improper conduct of the Tenders \u2013 has no bearing on the expropriation claim as the Claimants had no vested right that was at stake at the time of the Tenders (1). For the Respondent, the expropriation claim also fails in respect of the alleged pre-lease rights, since the contractual pre-lease rights ceased to exist as a result of the 2006 Lease Amendment (2) and the statutory pre-lease rights conferred no vested right subject to expropriation (3). In any event, the Respondent argues that the 2011 Amendment was a lawful exercise of police powers that is not compensable under international law (4).\n\n**(1) The Tenders are irrelevant to the expropriation claim**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the manner in which the NLA conducted the Tenders has no connection with the alleged expropriation, since the Claimants cannot seek damages for the expropriation of a lease that In\u00edcia did not hold. The Lease expired in July 2014 and In\u00edcia's participation in the Tenders could thus not lead to the renewal of the Lease, but only to the conclusion of a new lease, which admittedly did not happen. At the time of the alleged \"manipulation\" of the Tenders, the Claimants neither held a lease; nor could they claim an unconditional right to win the Tenders. Hence, according to the Respondent, even assuming that the Tenders were biased to ensure that the Claimants lost, they could not give rise to an expropriation claim.\n\n312.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent rejects the Claimants' allegation that the Tenders were manipulated. It argues that the circumstances on which the Claimants rely are either unsupported by evidence or irrelevant. Specifically, it makes the following submissions:\n\n\u2022 The NLA did not communicate the winning bids to In\u00edcia because In\u00edcia had no legal right to receive full details of such bids. In\u00edcia would only have been entitled to communication if it had an exercisable pre-lease right, which it did not. As for other tender documents, such as scoring sheets, In\u00edcia and the NLA were engaged in domestic litigation on In\u00edcia's right to access to that information. However, as a sign of good faith, the Respondent promptly complied with the Tribunal's order to produce the relevant documents in this arbitration.246\n\n\u2022 The Claimants' contention that they lost 15 out of the 16 Tenders on account of artificially low scores received for its business plan is demonstrably false. Even absent this component, which is worth 30 points out of a possible 105, In\u00edcia would have failed in at least eight tenders. The scoring sheets reveal that in three instances, the winners prevailed against In\u00edcia on all the other scores too.247 In five further instances, In\u00edcia's bids were simply disqualified as they did not attach all the required documentation.248\n\n\u2022 The Claimants purport to compare their farm with the farm of Mr. Szajko, who won the tenders in respect of the land which his farm was leasing. They suggest that Mr. Szajko's farm was \"similar\" to theirs in \"almost every respect\".249 There is, however, no evidence to support this assertion. In any event, the fact that Mr. Szajko won an unrelated tender says nothing about whether the Claimants lost the Tenders in an unfair manner.\n\n\u2022 Similarly, the Claimants do not substantiate their allegation that the winners of the Tenders and their families hold large tracts of land. Even if Mr. Hunter's assertion that the winners lease hundreds or in some cases one thousand hectares of land were true, this would not exceed the permitted maximum landholding limit, which is 1,800 hectares.250\n\nProcedural Order No. 2, Claimants' Requests No. 1 and 2.\n\nTenders HU22-10197, HU22-10198, HU22-10206. See Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10197, C-148, Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10198, C-149, Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10206, C-153, at the bottom of p. 2, note entitled \"Points without business plan\".\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 279, citing Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10234, C-158; Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10235, C-159; Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10274, C-160; Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10277, C-161; Point Scoring Sheet, Tender ID Number HU22-10278, C-162.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 182.\n\nHunter Second WS, \u00b6 14.\n\n313.\n\nTherefore, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimants' submission concerning the conduct of the Tenders, as such conduct cannot constitute an expropriation and the claim is in any event unsupported by evidence.\n\n**(2) Hungary did not expropriate the contractual pre-lease right**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants had no contractual pre-lease right under the 2006 Lease Amendment and that, even if they had, the NLA's denial of the exercise of that right would constitute a breach of contract, not a violation of international law.\n\n315.\n\nAccording to Hungary, while the 2006 Lease Amendment allowed In\u00edcia to extend the Lease for 10 years, it envisaged that In\u00edcia would give up the contractual pre-lease right that had figured in earlier versions of the Lease. In particular, it removed the language \u2013 \"[i]n respect of these plots of land the lessor grants a pre-lease right to the current tenant\" \u2013 present in Section 3.2 of the 1999 Lease Agreement251 and substituted it with Section 5.1 of the 2006 Lease Amendment, which reads as follows:\n\nWith regard to the plots of land subject to the lease, the Tenant enjoys a pre-emption right and a pre-lease right that may be exercised in accordance with the applicable laws effective at all times, and which may not be registered in the Land Registry.252\n\n1999 Lease Agreement, C-38.\n\n2006 Lease Agreement, C-40.\n\n316.\n\nIn 2017, the Metropolitan Court \u2013 a court with exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising under the 2006 Amendment253 \u2013 ruled unequivocally, so says the Respondent, that this language did not confer a contractual pre-lease right to In\u00edcia.254 As a consequence, only circumstances akin to denial of justice could empower the Tribunal to reopen this ruling. The Claimants do not allege such circumstances, but instead re-argue their case before this Tribunal on the ground that the Metropolitan Court's judgment is \"not persuasive\".255 A treaty tribunal cannot assume a mandate of a global court of appeal, purporting to correct the local courts' interpretations of municipal law.\n\nSection 7.4 of the 2006 Lease Amendment, C-40 (\"*The Parties to the current agricultural land lease contract declare to subject themselves exclusively to the jurisdiction of Pest Central District Court, and if the value of the subject of litigation warrants it, then to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Court, which will have competence regarding the legal relation of the lawsuit.*\")\n\nJudgment of Second Instance No. 44.Pf.633.704/2017/14, 7 December 2017, C-105.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 218.\n\n317.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants' unsupported contention that In\u00edcia had filed a request for extraordinary review of the judgment of the Metropolitan Court to the Curia does not alter this analysis. As a matter of Hungarian law, a judgment of the Metropolitan Court is not subject to appeal.256 While it can be subject to annulment, the annulment proceedings do not stay enforcement of the Metropolitan Court's judgment. As a result, the judgment must be deemed to carry *res judicata* effects.257\n\nPursuant to Section 218 of the 1952 Hungarian Code of Civil Procedure (the \"1952 CPP\"), a decision that cannot be appealed becomes final upon its publication. Sections 233 and 233A of the 1952 CCP provide an exhaustive list of decisions subject to appeal. This list does not include the judgments of a court of second instance, such as the judgment of 7 December 2017 rendered by the Metropolitan Court (See Extracts from the 1952 Hungarian Code of Civil Procedure, R-33).\n\nPursuant to Section 275 of the 1952 CPP, extraordinary review by the Curia can lead to the annulment of a final decision. However, Section 273(3) of the 1952 CPP specifies that a petition for review does not have the effect of staying enforcement of the decision subject to review (See Extracts from the 1952 Hungarian Code of Civil Procedure, R-33).\n\n318.\n\nIn any event, so argues the Respondent, the Metropolitan Court's interpretation of Section 5.1 of the 2006 Lease Amendment is fully tenable. The Claimants' contrary arguments based on the rules *contra proferentem* and against surprise terms do not withstand scrutiny. Hungary does not contest that these provisions apply to standard contracts. However, as the opinion PK 2/2011 of the Curia holds, a contract is not a standard contract \"if the consumer had a real opportunity to modify the contract term, meaning the party establishing the contract term in advance has actually made it possible for him to consider its content and to enforce his will in this regard.\"258\n\nOpinion PK 2/2011 of the Supreme Court, R-34. This decision was rendered by the Court in the context of consumer contracts (private individuals). The rational applies *mutatis mutandis* and, even so more, to contracts concluded with business entities.\n\n319.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it is undisputed that In\u00edcia received a draft 2006 Lease Amendment in advance of the signature. Yet, it did not use this opportunity to seek changes to the contract, unlike other lessees who concluded their leases contemporaneously. For instance, the lessee involved in the *Gyula* litigation succeeded in including the clause providing for the pre-lease right into the amended lease contract.259 Consequently, the terms of the 2006 Lease Amendments were open to negotiation. The Claimants' reliance on the result of the *Gyula* litigation is misplaced.\n\nRCM, \u00b6 448. The relevant provision in the *Gyula* litigation granted the pre-lease right as follows \"the lessee acknowledges that the pre-emption and pre-lease right provided under this amendment to the contract, and further by law\", See *Gyula* litigation documents: Judgment of First Instance (No. 1.P.20.249/2015/7) dated 16 June 2015, C-109; Judgment of Second Instance (No. 9.Pf.25.447/2015/7), 19 October 2015, C-110; Judgment of the Curia (No. Pfv.V.20.054/2016/10), 2 March 2016 (\"the Gyula Case\"), C-113.\n\n320.\n\nIn any event, the invocation of the rule *contra proferentem* is inapposite for yet another reason. According to the Respondent, this rule applies when contractual terms are ambiguous. Section 5.1 of the 2006 Lease Amendment clearly refers to a pre-lease right that \"may be exercised in accordance with the applicable laws effective at all times\". These words unambiguously refer to the statutory pre-lease right. The fact that the Parties diverge on the interpretation of the provision is not sufficient to conclude that a provision is ambiguous.\n\n321.\n\nSimilarly, in respect of the rule on surprise terms embodied in the Civil Code, the Respondent contends that, even if Section 5.1 were to be regarded as a surprise term, the only consequence would be that it would be unenforceable. It would not mean that the pre-lease provision of the 1999 Lease Agreement would be reinstated. And, even if Section 3.2 of the 1999 Lease Agreement were reinstated, that lease and any pre-lease right it established would in any event have expired in 2009, *i.e.* well before In\u00edcia purported to exercise the pre-lease right in 2014.\n\n322.\n\nFor these reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to reject the Claimants' attempt to re-litigate issues of national law which the Hungarian courts with exclusive jurisdiction have already resolved.\n\n323.\n\nFinally, Hungary argues that even if the Tribunal were to find that In\u00edcia was entitled to the contractual pre-lease right, the NLA's refusal to comply with this right would constitute no more than a contractual breach. Hungary has not passed any legislative or administrative measures prohibiting the exercise of a contractual pre-lease right. The Claimants' argument that the NLA had the status and function of a State organ is misconceived. Status and function of a given body can be relied upon to determine whether an entity is an emanation of a State and whether its acts are attributable to the State. However, they cannot establish whether the acts complained of in a particular instance were committed in the exercise of sovereign power. Numerous treaty tribunals have clearly stated that a simple denial of a contractual right by a State party amounts to a breach of contract, as opposed to an internationally wrongful act.260\n\n*Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v. Republic of Ghana*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award, 18 June 2010, RL-98, \u00b6\u00b6 190-191; *United Parcel Services of America Inc v. Government of Canada*, Award on the Merits, 24 May 2007, RL-99, \u00b6\u00b6 63-78; *Consortium RFCC v. Morocco*, CL-59, \u00b6\u00b6 51, 65.\n\n324.\n\nThe NLA's denial of In\u00edcia's alleged contractual pre-lease right arose in the course of ordinary business between a landlord and a tenant. The same observation applies to the alleged \"'attempt to take back possession of the land on 25 July 2014,' the purported 'transfer of possession of the land in October 2014' and the 'physical eviction [\u2026] using private armed security guards.'\"261 Here too, the NLA acted as an ordinary landlord without resorting to government prerogatives. Its conduct is therefore not subject to scrutiny under the BIT.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 379, citing C-Reply, \u00b6 208.\n\n**(3) Hungary did not expropriate the statutory pre-lease right**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n325.\n\nThe Respondent further counters the Claimants' allegation that it expropriated In\u00edcia's statutory pre-lease right. It submits that the statutory pre-lease right is not a vested right under international or Hungarian law. Instead, it is a right conferred by general legislation which can change based on policy considerations and bear circumstances. In this context, it is undisputed that the Claimants never received any assurances that the legislation would remain unchanged.\n\n326.\n\nThe Respondent refers to decisions of investment treaty tribunals, according to which, in the absence of specific assurances, the State retains the power to change its laws.262 The distinction that the Claimants draw arguing that the present case is a direct not an indirect expropriation is unavailing. The 2011 Amendment did not directly remove the statutory pre-lease right; it only limited the exercise of that right in connection with the tenders organized by the NLA. Thus, it was not a measure of direct expropriation.\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, RL-53, \u00b6 332.\n\n327.\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Hungary confirmed that the statutory pre-lease right is not a vested right. It held that statutory pre-lease right holders must consider \"that the law may change.\"263 The Claimants and their legal expert Professor Halmai purport to rebut this settled law by reference to the principles of \"legal certainty\" and \"lawful expectations\" arguing that \"the 2011 Amendment was unfair and unjustified (and therefore unconstitutional).\"264 This does little to show that Hungary's measures were expropriatory. The Contracting States to the BIT limited the Tribunal's mandate to deciding disputes exclusively in respect of expropriatory conduct, and the Tribunal ought to respect this undisputed limitation.\n\nConstitutional Court 16/2015 (VI.5) AB hat, 5 June 2015, R-16, \u00b6\u00b6 130-131.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 407, citing C-Reply, \u00b6 288.\n\n**(4) Hungary exercised police powers**\n---------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the 2011 Amendment was a regulatory measure carried out within the bounds of its police powers. It opposes the Claimants' argument that the doctrine of police powers applies only to indirect expropriations on two grounds. First, numerous tribunals have referred to the police powers doctrine when assessing the existence of a direct expropriation.265 Second, the 2011 Amendment was not a direct expropriation as it did not remove or invalidate In\u00edcia's statutory pre-lease right. It merely restricted its exercise in the context of NLA tenders. The defense of police powers is therefore available to the Respondent.\n\n*Burlington v. Ecuador*, RL-60, \u00b6 506: \"[U]nder the standard applicable to direct expropriation [\u2026] a State measure constitutes expropriation under the Treaty if (i) the measure deprives the investor of his investment; (ii) the deprivation is permanent; and (iii) the deprivation finds no justification under the police powers doctrine.\"; See, also *Quiborax S.A. and Non Metallic Minerals S.A. v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Award, 16 September 2015 (\"*Quiborax v. Bolivia*\"), CL-15, \u00b6 200: \"The tribunal in *Burlington* which the Claimants cite, articulated the standard for a direct expropriation as follows: 'a State measure constitutes expropriation under the Treaty if (i) the measure deprives the investor of its investment; (ii) the deprivation is permanent; and (iii) the deprivation finds no justification under the police powers doctrine.' This Tribunal agrees with this enunciation of the relevant standard.\"\n\n329.\n\nThe Respondent strongly denies the Claimants' allegations that Hungary's organs, including the government and the legislature, had ulterior motives of political favoritism and xenophobia with respect to the land reform. When implementing the land reform, Hungary states that it acted in pursuit of the common welfare objective of \"promoting the establishment of viable family farms\".266 As the primary means to implement its newly defined landholding policies, Hungary introduced a tender procedure in 2010. The system of statutory pre-lease rights was incompatible with the tender system because it prevented the redistribution of the State-owned land on the basis of the criteria established for the tender. This incompatibility was admitted by Professor \u00c1ngy\u00e1n, the former politician on whose politically-biased 2014 report the Claimants rely.267 The 2011 Amendment, which proscribed the exercise of statutory pre-lease rights in the context of the NLA tenders, evidently aimed at implementing Hungary's general welfare objectives.\n\nSection 1(3)(a) of the 2010 NLA Act, R-12.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 420, citing Parliamentary speech of Dr. J\u00f3zsef \u00c1ngy\u00e1n of 28 May 2013, R-35.\n\n330.\n\nIn addition, the Parliament passed the 2011 Amendment in accordance with standard legislative procedures, involving multiple rounds of consultation and the implementation of many of the opposition's comments. As a result, the opposition supported the bill.268\n\nAgricultural Committee Minutes of 28 June 2011, C-47.\n\n331.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants' contentions of manipulation of the Tenders are also unfounded. The report of the Supervisory Committee of the NLA, which the Claimants invoke, concluded that the tender evaluation system was in line with Hungarian law and landholding policy.269\n\nR-Rejoinder, paras. 429-432; NLF Supervisory Report of 22 March 2012, R-37 (additional translation of the original text in C-66)\n\n332.\n\nProfessor \u00c1ngy\u00e1n's bold statement that the tenders did not achieve the stated public policy objectives does not help the Claimants' case either. While the land reform may not have been as successful as the government had hoped, it still achieved important results. In particular, the number of tenants rose drastically from 600 in 2010 to 7500 in 2015. Nearly 85% of these new tenants were natural persons, and 21% of them were under the age of 40. The average size of the land awarded by tender was 24.81 hectares.270\n\nRCM, \u00b6 159; Summary of Results of the \"Land for Farmers\" Programme 2010-2015, R-19, p. 2.\n\n333.\n\nAs to the 16 Tenders in which In\u00edcia participated, In\u00edcia's low scores for the subjective business plan element did not determine the outcome. In line with the policy objectives of the land reform, the Land was awarded to 16 farmers all of whom were locals. Six of the winners were family farmers, six were individual entrepreneurs and four were primary producers. Moreover, seven winners were young farmers and five were new entrants.271 The Claimants supply no evidence that the winners of the Tenders were politically favored individuals affiliated with the Fidesz party or otherwise related to the government.\n\nPoint Scoring Sheets of NLA, C-147 to C-162.\n\n334.\n\nSimilarly unsupported is the Claimants' contention that Hungary abolished the maximum landholding limitation applicable to family members in order to benefit families with connections to politicians. According to the Respondent, this abolishment contributed to the government's aim of keeping local farmers, who often belong to the same family, from migrating to the cities and abandoning the agricultural sector.272\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 450.\n\n335.\n\nThe Claimants' allegations of discrimination should also be dismissed, so pleads Hungary. None of their brandish allegations of xenophobic motives relate to the 2011 Amendment. As for the Claimants' assertion that the 2011 Amendment \"only applied in the context of tenders for leases of State-owned, and not privately owned, land\",273 the Respondent points out that there are objective differences between State-owned land and leases for privately-owned land, which cannot therefore be compared. In particular, leases of State-owned land can be attributed only by means of a public tender and benefit from significantly lower rental fees.274\n\nCM, \u00b6 268.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 466.\n\n336.\n\nFinally, Hungary challenges the Claimants' allegation that In\u00edcia's eviction did not follow due process. At the time of the eviction, the Claimants no longer had possessory title to the land. Thus, the NLA acting in its capacity of a landlord secured the eviction after giving multiple notices to In\u00edcia to vacate the Land. As Professor Menyh\u00e1rd explains, the orders that the Claimants had obtained from local authorities did not create a legal title to possession.275 In any event, even assuming that the eviction of In\u00edcia had breached these orders, that would at most constitute a violation of a temporary procedural right \u2013 not a taking of the leasehold right. In addition, the intervention of the private security guards did not occur until after the Pest District Court had rejected In\u00edcia's claims to the pre-lease rights in their entirety in October 2014.276 The claim of a breach of due process is therefore without merit.\n\nMenyh\u00e1rd Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 57, 58.\n\nJudgment of First Instance (No. 25.P.52.795/2014) 21 October 2014 (\"the In\u00edcia Case\"), C-115.\n\n337.\n\nFor these reasons, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to declare that the 2011 Amendment was a valid exercise of police powers and therefore did not constitute a compensable expropriation.\n\n**C. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n338.\n\nThe Claimants allege an expropriation of their leasehold rights. According to them, these rights include the following four categories: (i) the contractual pre-lease right under the Lease, (ii) the renewed lease agreement created by In\u00edcia's exercise of the contractual pre-lease right through its letter of 29 April 2014,277 (iii) the right to damages arising out of the NLA's manipulation of the Tenders, and (iv) the statutory pre-lease right, the exercise of which was prevented by the 2011 Amendment.\n\nLetter of 29 April 2014 from In\u00edcia to the NLA, C-20; CM, \u00b6 78.\n\n339.\n\nIn its analysis of liability, the Tribunal will first review Hungary's measures in terms of expropriation of the statutory pre-lease right (1). Given the conclusion which it will reach, in respect of such right, it will dispense with the analysis of the alleged expropriation of the remaining categories of the purported leasehold rights. Thereafter, the Tribunal will assess whether the 2011 Amendment constituted a non-compensable exercise of Hungary's police powers (2). Finally, it will turn to the lawfulness of the expropriation under Article 6 of the BIT (3).\n\n**(1) Did the 2011 Amendment expropriate the statutory pre-lease right?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nIt is common ground between the Parties that the 2011 Amendment prohibited the exercise of statutory pre-lease rights in relation to the NLA tenders. The Parties also agree that, at the time when the statute was passed, In\u00edcia had a valid statutory pre-lease right under Hungarian law. The Respondent argues, however, that such statutory pre-lease right is not capable of being expropriated.\n\n341.\n\nThe Parties made it clear in their answers to the Tribunal's questions that international law governs the question whether a particular right can be expropriated.278 By contrast, the existence and content of the right is subject to national law. Thus, while the expert evidence provided by the Parties in respect of rights capable of being expropriated within the meaning of Hungarian constitutional law may be helpful by analogy, it is not dispositive. The Tribunal must conduct an analysis under the BIT and international law in order to determine what types of rights or interests are protected under Article 6 of the BIT.\n\nTranscript, Day 4, 824:13-14, 912:21-913:2.\n\n342.\n\nArticle 6 of the BIT prohibits the expropriation of \"the investments of investors\", except for a public purpose, with due process, in a non-discriminatory manner and against compensation. Article 1 of the BIT in turn defines the term \"investment\" as \"every kind of asset connected with economic activities which has been acquired since 31 December 1972\".279 In this context, the Respondent argues that \"a right that is not vested or acquired as a matter of International Law is not susceptible of expropriation.\"280 Be this as it may, at the time of the 2011 Amendment, the Claimants did hold a vested right in the form of the statutory pre-lease right, as will be further addressed below.\n\nUK-Hungary BIT, CL-1.\n\nTranscript, Day 4, 913:12-14.\n\n343.\n\nThe doctrine of acquired or vested rights is well recognized in international and municipal laws. In the words of the *Aramco* tribunal:\n\nThe principle of respect of acquired rights is one of the fundamental principles both of Public International Law and of the municipal law of most civilized States.281\n\n*Saudi Arabia v. Aramco*, Award, ILR 1963, at 117 et seq; See also, Permanent Court of International Justice, German Interests in Polish Upper Silesia (Merits), Judgment of 25 May 1926, 1926 PCIJ Series A, No. 7, p. 22; German Settlers in Poland, Advisory Opinion of 10 September 1923, 1923 PCIJ Series B, No. 6, p. 362.\n\n344.\n\nThe term expropriation used in Article 6 of the BIT should be interpreted in light of this doctrine as mandated by Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT. The doctrine suggests that, while the State may change general statutes based on its policy decisions, where the statute provided for a possibility of acquiring rights with economic value and a private party availed itself of this possibility, subsequent regulatory changes must respect that vested right.282 As an example, a State can well change the rules applicable to pension entitlements. However, if an individual has acquired a right to pension entitlements under the existing statute, *e.g.* because he or she has reached the relevant retirement age, the detrimental legislative change must comply with this vested right.\n\nLalive, \"The Doctrine of Acquired Rights\", in *Rights and Duties of Private Investors Abroad* 145 (1965), RL-52, 165; *EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN3481, Award, 3 February 2006 (\"*EnCana v. Ecuador*\"), \u00b6 183.\n\n345.\n\n*EnCana v. Ecuador*, to which both Parties referred in the closing submissions, is helpful in this respect. There, the tribunal recognized that, although a State is free to change its laws, it may be held liable for expropriation if it retrospectively invalidates vested rights:\n\nIn the Tribunal's opinion, a law which cancels a liability the State already has to an investor [...] is capable of amounting to expropriation. The right under the law of the host State to refunds of VAT in respect of the past acquisition of goods and services is a material benefit, and it does not matter whether refunds take the form of tax credits or rights to actual payment of the amount due. There is an important distinction here between a law which changes the incidence of taxation in respect of future transactions and one which seeks to do so retrospectively. If the State wishes to provide by law that in respect of future transactions there is liability to VAT and no right to a refund, then *prima facie* at least that falls within the scope of its normal prerogative to determine and vary the incidence of a tax. But once a right to a refund has accrued in respect of past transactions (so that all that remains is the question of accounting for receipts and payments) the corresponding right to be paid is capable of falling within the broad scope of \"amounts yielded by an investment\", and it does not matter that the right arises under the public law of the State concerned.283\n\n*EnCana v. Ecuador*, \u00b6 183.\n\n346.\n\nThe *EnCana* tribunal made a crucial distinction between rights (to VAT refunds) that had accrued and rights that had not yet accrued at the time when Ecuador passed the 2004 Act that suppressed these rights. According to the tribunal, \"it is for Ecuador to determine for the future the regime of its tax law\". However, the \"position is different with respect to the period before 2004,\"284 as the rights that accrued prior to the legislative change attracted protection from uncompensated taking.\n\n*EnCana v. Ecuador*, \u00b6\u00b6 187-188.\n\n347.\n\nThroughout its written and oral submissions, Hungary heavily relied on the fact that the statutory pre-lease right was a right provided by general legislation, which the State could modify for policy reasons. The State's power to change its laws based on its policy determinations is unquestioned. This power must, however, be exercised in compliance with the international obligations of the State, including those in the field of the protection of investments. International law, and in particular the non-expropriation standard contained in Article 6 of the BIT, provides a certain degree of protection for vested rights. If a general statute gives private parties a possibility to acquire rights of economic value, changes to that legislation should not affect rights that had already been acquired under the statute. In this sense, the doctrine of vested rights is closely intertwined with the principles of non-retroactivity and legal certainty.\n\n348.\n\nThis said, a distinction must be drawn between a statute conferring mere privileges or powers on private parties and the latter's subsequent exercise of these powers by acquiring what can be regarded as a vested right, *i.e.* an entitlement that is correlated with duties of a specific counterpart.\n\n349.\n\nThe 1994 Arable Land Act provided the right (better termed a power) for any eligible person to enter into a lease agreement and thereby acquire a statutory pre-lease right. This power is not itself a vested right or an asset, and therefore the State could in principle change it without compensation.285 In turn, once a private party availed itself of this power and entered into a lease agreement, that party will hold a vested right.\n\nProvided that other general limitations, such as non-arbitrariness, non-discrimination and due process are respected.\n\n350.\n\nThus, while the Respondent was at liberty to change its laws and remove or otherwise alter the provision allowing to enter into a lease agreement and acquire a statutory pre-lease right, the private parties who had previously availed themselves of this possibility by entering into specific lease agreements had vested rights that ought to have been respected.\n\n351.\n\nIt is undisputed that the 2011 Amendment contained no transitory arrangements, nor did it exempt pre-lease rights of incumbent lessees.\n\n352.\n\nThe question that remains is whether the statutory pre-lease right was among the vested rights that a lessee acquired by entering into a lease agreement. In the affirmative, the 2011 Amendment would be deemed expropriatory, because it prevented the Claimants from exercising their statutory pre-lease right and failed to exempt vested pre-lease rights under incumbent leases.\n\n353.\n\nThe Claimants' legal expert Professor Halmai opined that the statutory pre-lease right was a vested right as of the conclusion of the relevant lease agreement.286 He explained his opinion in reference to the legislative intent behind the statutory pre-lease right, which was to induce long-term investment in the agricultural sector and, for that purpose, to enhance legal security for the lessees. As for the Respondent's legal expert Professor Menyh\u00e1rd, he called the pre-lease right a vested right in his expert report.287 However, at the Hearing, he preferred not to elaborate, given his expertise in private law.288\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 667-668.\n\nMenyhard Second ER, \u00b6 19.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, pp. 749-753.\n\n354.\n\nProfessor Halmai's opinion is substantiated by the dissenting opinion of a judge of the Constitutional Court, who reasoned that, by passing the 2011 Amendment, \"the legislator deprived the above lessees [i.e. the lessees that had lease agreements at the time of the entry into force of the 2011 Amendment] of a right with a property value that they acquired already at the time of the execution of the lease contracts\".289 Notably, the majority of the court did not address whether the 2011 Amendment could amount to an expropriation of vested rights in violation of the right to property, since this question as such was not before the court.\n\nConstitutional Court Decision 16/2015, C-192, \u00b6 185.\n\n355.\n\nThe opinion of Professor Halmai appears convincing. If one bears in mind that enterprises and foreign nationals are barred from owning agricultural land in Hungary, land lease agreements largely fulfil the same functions as property rights. As the Claimants explain, investments in the agricultural sector take time. In order to encourage long-term investments, the 1994 Arable Land Act provided for a pre-lease right, but this right could only induce long-term investments if the lessees could rely on it when entering into lease agreements.\n\n356.\n\nIt is certainly true that the exercise of the pre-lease right is subject to conditions. However, as Professor Halmai rightly notes, the conditional nature of a right does not negate its existence or its nature as a vested right. For instance, as the Respondent observed, when making a long-term investment in reliance on the lease and the pre-lease right, the lessee should consider the possibility that, upon the expiry of the lease, the owner may decide to use the land, in which case the pre-lease right could not be exercised. While this is true, Mr. Hunter correctly remarked that the risk that the State would decide to become a farmer instead of leasing its land was negligible.290 And indeed, it is not the materialization of this risk that made the exercise of the pre-lease right impossible for In\u00edcia. It was the legislative act that proscribed the exercise of pre-lease rights, without providing exceptions for lessees that had already acquired the pre-lease right under the incumbent lease agreements.\n\nTranscript Day 1, 190:22-191:6.\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondent further points to the pre-lease clause in the 2006 Lease Amendment, according to which a pre-lease right \"may be exercised in accordance with the applicable laws effective at all times\".291 This language subjects the exercise of the contractual pre-lease right to the applicable law. It has no bearing, however, on the statutory pre-lease right, the exercise of which is restricted by the 2011 Amendment in the following terms:\n\nIn case of leasehold of rural land or farm, a pre-lease right arising from legal regulations may not be exercised.292\n\n2006 Lease Agreement, C-40, Section 5.1.\n\nAct CI of 2011 on the amendment of certain acts relating to agricultural land, 19 July 2011, C-45, Article 11.\n\n358.\n\nThe nature and scope of the *statutory* pre-lease right must be assessed by reference to the relevant statute, *i.e.* the 1994 Arable Land Act. Pursuant to Section 21 of that Act, a lessee of a usufructuary lease was entitled to a pre-lease right.293 As described above, given the purpose and context of this statutory provision, the entitlement to and the reliance on the pre-lease right arose upon the conclusion of a usufructuary lease agreement. Thus, In\u00edcia's entitlement to the statutory pre-lease right existed by virtue of Section 21 of the 1994 Arable Land Act and of the Lease. The contractual pre-lease clause does not alter the nature and scope of the statutory pre-lease right. Indeed, even if the 2006 Lease Amendment contained no pre-lease provision at all, In\u00edcia would still benefit from the statutory pre-lease right under Section 21 of the 1994 Arable Land Act because it had entered into a usufructuary lease agreement.\n\nThe 1994 Arable Land Act, 27 July 1994, R-4, Section 21.\n\n359.\n\nThe Parties have also debated whether the pre-lease right is a right *in rem* or not. That debate seems largely inapposite for the purposes of this analysis. As the Parties' legal experts confirmed, the scope of the rights protected from expropriation is not congruent with the closed list of *in rem* rights in civil law.294 While the dichotomy between *in rem* and *in personam* rights has its place in determining the rights and obligations of private parties vis-\u00e0-vis one another, the prohibition of uncompensated expropriation is a rule restricting the State authority towards private parties. Because of the different legal functions involved, the civil law dichotomy should not be mechanically transposed into public law. Indeed, it would be excessively formalistic and not consonant with economic reality, if the BIT protected a usufruct-holder from an uncompensated taking, while at the same time withholding that protection from a lessee with a pre-lease right for the sole fact that such right is not *in rem*.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 629:20-630:20 (Halmai); Menyh\u00e1rd Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 11-13.\n\n360.\n\nIt does not appear disputed that the function of the statutory pre-lease right was to guarantee stability and legal certainty for lessees of agricultural land, and thus induce long-term investments. In a situation where corporations and foreign nationals were barred from owning agricultural land, the pre-lease right brought stability of the lease that was viewed as a functional alternative to ownership. For these reasons, the Tribunal shares Professor Halmai's opinion that, due to the pre-lease right, the lease fulfilled the same function as ownership in terms of the investor's expectations of legal certainty and stability. As a result, the pre-lease right must be deemed to benefit from the protection against uncompensated State interference. In other words, a deprivation of already vested pre-lease rights should have been accompanied by compensation even if the State acted with a legitimate public purpose, evenhandedly and with procedural propriety.\n\n361.\n\nFinally, the Parties have discussed whether the statutory pre-lease right has a financial value.295 It seems evident that a right, albeit a conditional one, to extend a lease agreement has a financial value as the right-holder is in an economically more advantageous position than a lessee without a similar right. The financial value of a pre-lease right can also be seen from the market practice, whereby incumbent lessees sometimes appoint third persons to exercise the pre-lease right in their stead in exchange for consideration.296 The fact that the value of the pre-lease right may be difficult to quantify does not mean that the right lacks value. The Respondent's own valuation expert sought to convince the Tribunal that the value of the pre-lease right could be established independently by using freehold ownership as a proxy.297\n\nUnder Article 1(1)(iii) of the BIT, one of the examples of an asset constituting and investment is \"claims to money and other assets or to any performance under contract having a financial value\", CL-1.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, pp. 723-724.\n\nVersant Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 180-181.\n\n362.\n\nFor these reasons, while Hungary was at liberty to remove or otherwise alter the statutory pre-lease provision contained in the 1994 Arable Land Act in a prospective manner, such a change should not have applied retrospectively to already vested rights. Or else, the State should have provided compensation. Specifically with respect to the Claimants' investment, the 2011 Amendment resulted in the expropriation of the statutory pre-lease right that In\u00edcia had acquired pursuant to the 1994 Arable Land Act by entering into the Lease.\n\n363.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Tribunal dispenses with analyzing whether the Respondent also expropriated In\u00edcia's contractual pre-lease right, or whether such right was extinguished as a result of the 2006 Lease Agreement. Subject to the police powers defense addressed in the next section, the finding that Hungary expropriated In\u00edcia's statutory pre-lease right suffices to hold Hungary liable for the harm caused to the Claimants as a result of the loss of the Lease. Had the 2011 Amendment carved out the pre-lease rights of incumbent lessees, In\u00edcia would in all likelihood have exercised that right and kept its Lease. Therefore, a finding that the contractual pre-lease right was also expropriated would have no impact on the assessment of damages. Nor would the claims concerning the alleged manipulation of tender results have an independent impact on the quantification of the loss. Therefore, for reasons of judicial economy and procedural efficiency, the Tribunal will dispense with addressing these additional issues.\n\n**(2) Was the 2011 Amendment a non-compensable regulatory measure?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nInvestment treaty jurisprudence recognizes that, in certain circumstances, a *bona fide* exercise of the State's right to regulate is exempt from the duty to provide compensation.298 That being said, creating an unqualified exception from the duty of compensation for all regulatory measures would hardly be compatible with the language of non-expropriation provisions of investment treaties, such as Article 6 of the BIT, which require compensation for direct and indirect expropriation even if the measures at issue are for a public purpose, non-discriminatory and compatible with due process of law. As the tribunal in *Pope & Talbot v. Canada* warned, such blanket exception \"would create a gaping loophole in international protections against expropriation.\"299\n\n*Crompton (Chemtura) Corp. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL Award, 2 August 2010 (\"*Chemtura v. Canada*\"), \u00b6 266; *Philip Morris Brands S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A. and Abal Hermanos S.A. v. Oriental Republic of Uruguay*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award, 8 July 2016 (\"*Philip Morris v. Uruguay*\"), \u00b6 305; see also, Harvard Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens; Third Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States (1987); OECD Working Paper on Indirect Expropriation and Right to Regulate.\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, NAFTA, Award, 16 December 2002, \u00b6 105.\n\n365.\n\nThere is no comprehensive test that may be used to distinguish regulatory expropriation, for which compensation is required, from an exercise of police or regulatory powers, which does not give rise to a duty of compensation. In the words of *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, \"international law has yet to identify in a comprehensive and definitive fashion precisely what regulations are considered 'permissible' and 'commonly accepted' as falling within the police or regulatory power of States and, thus, non-compensable.\"300\n\n*Saluka Investments B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006 (\"*Saluka v. Czech Republic*\"), RL-54, \u00b6 263.\n\n366.\n\nThis being so, a review of investment awards shows that measures annulling rights of the investor \u2013 as in the present case \u2013 can be exempt from the otherwise applicable duty of compensation only in a narrow set of circumstances. These circumstances can be categorized in two broad groups:\n\n\u2022 First, the exemption from compensation may apply to generally accepted measures of police powers that aim at enforcing existing regulations against the investor's own wrongdoings, such as criminal, tax and administrative sanctions, or revocation of licenses and concessions.301 It is evident that the 2011 Amendment does not pertain to this group.\n\n\u2022 The second group consists of regulatory measures aimed at abating threats that the investor's activities may pose to public health, environment or public order.302 This line of case law relates to measures such as the prohibition of harmful substances, tobacco plain packaging, or the imposition of emergency measures in times of political or economic crises. The 2011 Amendment does not fall in this group either.\n\n*Invesmart, B.V. v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Award (Redacted), 26 June 2009, RL-55; *Tza Yap Shum v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/6, Award, 7 July 2011; *Saluka v. Czech Republic*, RL-54; *RosInvestCo UK Ltd. v. Russian Federation*, SCC Case No. V079/2005, Final Award, 12 September 2010.\n\n*Chemtura v. Canada* ; *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Final Award on Jurisdiction and the Merits, 3 August 2005, RL-109; *AWG Group Ltd. v. The Argentine Republic*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Liability, 30 July 2010; *Philip Morris v. Uruguay*.\n\n367.\n\nIt rather emerges from the record that the 2011 Amendment was inspired by Hungary's decision to change its agricultural land holding policy. While Hungary was fully entitled to change its policies, in doing so it was required to respect vested rights. In other words, it is not immediately apparent why this policy change - which purportedly benefited Hungarian society as a whole - should have been carried out at the expense of the Claimants' vested rights. Unlike in the above two groups of situations, there is no rationale that would justify exempting Hungary from its duty to pay compensation under Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n**(3) Was the expropriation lawful?**\n-------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nIt is undisputed that Hungary has not compensated the Claimants for the expropriation of their statutory pre-lease right. Thus, the expropriation is unlawful for lack of compensation. Whether an expropriatory measure is unlawful for additional reasons may have an impact on the calculation of damages in certain instances.\n\n369.\n\nMost importantly, a finding that expropriation is unlawful for reasons other than the lack of compensation may entitle a claimant investor to request compensation for the value of the expropriated asset on an *ex post* basis, *i.e.* on the date of the award.303 Yet, in the present case, the Claimants seek the value of their leasehold rights *ex ante*, *i.e.* as of July 2015, which is the date of their eviction from the Land.\n\nSee *Quiborax v. Bolivia*, CL-15, \u00b6\u00b6 370-383.\n\n370.\n\nThey do so by subtracting the value of the Farm without the Lease from the value of the Farm with the Lease. This approach seems to yield the value of the expropriated pre-lease rights. Indeed, without expropriation of their pre-lease right, the Claimants would in all likelihood have renewed the lease by matching the offers made by the winners of the Tenders. The Respondent's valuation expert concedes that \"the lost value of the leasehold rights could be quantified by comparing the value of the Farm with and without those rights. In other words, the difference in the value of the Farm with and without the leasehold rights is equal to the lost value of those rights.\"304 Therefore, the Claimants do not appear to be claiming more than \"the fair market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation\", which is the compensation standard for lawful expropriations under Article 6 of the BIT. Thus, in this respect, it makes no practical difference whether the expropriation is unlawful for reasons other than lack of compensation.\n\nSequeira First ER, \u00b6 46.\n\n371.\n\nAnother aspect of the valuation for which a finding of lawfulness may theoretically make a difference is pre- and post-award interest. However, Article 6 of the BIT requires an award of interest \"at a normal commercial rate\". As explained in the relevant section below, even if the principle of full reparation is applied, the Claimants would not be entitled to more than a normal commercial rate of interest in the circumstances of the present case.\n\n372.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal comes to a conclusion that it may dispense with determining whether the expropriation was unlawful for reasons other than lack of compensation.\n\n**VI. QUANTUM**\n---------------\n\n373.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute about the calculation of the damages allegedly suffered by the Claimants as a result of the Respondent's conduct. Each of them relied on a valuation expert to support its position.\n\n**A. THE CLAIMANTS' POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nThe Claimants seek compensation for the expropriation of the pre-lease right. They rely on a valuation expert report by Mr. James Gilbey of Mazars LLP, who primarily valued the expropriated leasehold by comparing the actual value of the Farm (without the leasehold rights) with the but-for value of the Farm (with the leasehold rights).305 More precisely, Mr. Gilbey valued the leasehold rights by reference to the stream of profits that those rights could have been expected to produce for the Claimants' farming business if they had not been expropriated.306 The but-for scenario thus assumes that the Lease would be renewed for 20 years starting from 2014.307\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 337; Mazars First ER, \u00b6\u00b6 2.2.5-2.2.8.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 343.\n\nMazars First ER, \u00b6 2.2.7.\n\n375.\n\nAs for the valuation date, Mr. Gilbey considered that the expropriation crystalized in July 2015, which is the time of the physical eviction of the Claimants. He thus took July 2015 as the valuation date.\n\n376.\n\nFurther, the Claimants seek to rebut the Respondent's criticism that Mr. Gilbey calculated the but-for value of the Farm on an *ex ante* basis, *i.e.* in July 2015, while he assessed the actual value *ex post*. According to the Claimants, for the actual value, Mr. Gilbey used July 2015 as a valuation date, but he used \"actual cash-flows for the years up to and including 2017\", instead of projecting hypothetical cash flows from 2015 on.308 For the event that the Tribunal accepts the Respondent's criticism, Mr. Gilbey prepared a \"secondary\" valuation, which only takes into account *ex ante* data for both the but-for and the actual values of the farm.\n\nMazars Second ER \u00b6 2.3.10.\n\n377.\n\nThe Claimants also reject the Respondent's allegation that they have failed to mitigate the loss. They point out that the burden of proof is on the Respondent to demonstrate that there were reasonable and economically feasible alternative actions available to them.309 For them, the Respondent failed to discharge this burden, due to the fact that they have in reality engaged in multiple efforts to continue their farming business in Hungary. Yet, despite these efforts, their Farm lost significant value. Specifically, the Claimants stress the following mitigating actions:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Hunter described how the Claimants sought to lease replacement land from private individuals by publishing an advertisement and an article in a local newspaper.310 They only received an offer for 15 hectares of land 50 km away. In any event, the privately-owned land is encumbered by statutory pre-lease rights, meaning that the Claimants would be pre-empted by the incumbent lessees.\n\n\u2022 In\u00edcia's employees travelled sometimes hundreds of kilometers to purchase feed for and dispose of digestate from the cows.311\n\n\u2022 Mr. Hunter personally made efforts in (i) qualifying as a 'local farmer' in 2015 in order to bid at auctions to buy agricultural land for the farm; and (ii) sitting for the examination to become a Hungarian citizen in order to persuade the Respondent to sign the contract with him for the 86-hectare parcel of land that he subsequently won at auction. Despite these efforts, Mr. Hunter was ultimately deprived of this opportunity to mitigate Claimants' losses by Mr. R\u00e1cz, the son of a local Fidesz mayor, who exercised his statutory pre-emption right to take over the ownership of this parcel of land in place of Mr. Hunter.312\n\n\u2022 The Claimants obtained temporary and unnotified sublets to the portions of the Land from the winners of the Tenders. In particular, they sub-leased (i) 86 hectares won by Robert R\u00e1cz (Tender No. 10213); (ii) 13 hectares from the plot won by Viktor Huszar (Tender No. 10211); and (iii) 8 hectares from the plot won by Zoltan Kov\u00e1cs (Tender No. 10212).313\n\nC-Reply, 356, citing *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6, Award, 12 April 2002, CL-32, \u00b6 170.\n\nHunter First WS, \u00b6 98; CM, \u00b6 573.\n\nHunter First WS, \u00b6\u00b6 92-94.\n\nHunter Second WS, \u00b6\u00b6 45-47.\n\nHunter Second WS, Section 4.1.3.\n\n378.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants argue that the criticism raised by the Respondent's expert at the milk prices, applied in Mr. Gilbey's valuation as equal to EU prices, is also unmeritorious. It fails to consider that In\u00edcia actually achieved to sell milk at EU prices in 2018 and that many of its contracts are pegged to German milk prices, which are even higher than the EU average price.314\n\nMazars Second ER, \u00b6 4.2.8.\n\n379.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Respondent's criticism of Mr. Gilbey's calculation of the price of calves and in-calf heifers is equally unfounded. While the Respondent is right that the Claimants have historically sold culled cows at a 70% discount, they have never sold cows producing milk or in-calf heifers. Therefore, Mr. Gilbey's assumption that those could be sold at a market value is reasonable.\n\n380.\n\nThe Claimants also refute the comments by Respondent's expert Mr. Sequeira according to which Mr. Gilbey assumed that certain costs would remain fixed despite his projection of a significant increase in the size of the herd and the production of milk. As Mr. Hunter explains, \"[t]he costs of running the facilities (which can cater for up to 2500 animals) are fixed.\"315\n\nHunter First WS, \u00b6 93.\n\n381.\n\nIn connection with interest rates, Mr. Gilbey has applied 7.87% by reference to the rate of return on capital that the shareholders of Magyar had realized historically and thus could reasonably have expected to enjoy in the future, but for the expropriation. Contrary to the Respondent's criticism, the \"normal commercial rate\" of interest envisaged in the BIT's expropriation provision is not applicable here, since this is an unlawful expropriation. Similarly, the Respondent's expert wrongly suggests that Mr. Gilbey's proposal to compound interest *semi-annually* is incompatible with his choice of the *annual* rate of return as the interest rate. As Mr. Gilbey explains, when computing the compound interest he did not simply divide 7.87% in two, which would have given 3.94%, but instead reduced the semi-annual rate to 3.86% to take into account that the interest is compounded semi-annually.316\n\nMazars Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 7.3.2-7.3.3.\n\n382.\n\nFinally, the Claimants also request compensation for the costs of the Hungarian court proceedings. They point to the jurisprudence of investment tribunals, which confirms that such costs are recoverable under the principle of full compensation.317 Following the Respondent's comment that the supporting invoices included unrelated transactions, the Claimants subtracted three out of five invoices from the claimed amount calculations, as these dealt with costs related to the Claimants' Serbian farm.\n\n*Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award, 1 June 2009, CL-68, \u00b6 593; *Swisslion DOO Skopje v. The Former Yusgoslav Rpeublic of Macedonia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/16, Award, 6 July 2012, RL-111, \u00b6\u00b6 344 and 350.\n\n383.\n\nWith respect to the Respondent's criticism that Mr. Gilbey double-counted the litigation costs, since these costs were already accounted for in the but-for value of the Farm, the Claimants point to the passage of Mr. Gilbey's report, where he explains that, since legal and professional costs were unusually high in the year 2014, he took the average of the prior two years (2012 and 2013) to reflect these costs more accurately.318 Therefore, the litigation costs are not included in the but-for value of the farm.\n\nC-Reply, \u00b6 370; Mazars First ER, \u00b6 3.6.4.\n\n384.\n\nFor these reasons, the Claimants request the Tribunal to award full compensation for damages resulting from the Respondent's unlawful expropriation of their leasehold rights in the amount of EUR 17,900,000, plus costs and expenses of these proceedings, as well as costs and expenses and of the litigation in Hungary in an amount of HUF 57,222,236, together with interest at 7.87% compounded semi-annually until the payment is made in full.\n\n**B. THE RESPONDENT'S POSITION**\n--------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Respondent relies on a valuation report prepared by Mr. Kiran Sequeira of Versant Partners LLC. Mr. Sequeira has estimated the range of the Claimants' loss between EUR 3,400,000 and EUR 5,600,000.\n\n386.\n\nThe Respondent first contends that the standard of compensation should be the \"fair market value of the investment expropriated\", as envisaged by Article 6(1) of the BIT, and not that of consequential loss, as suggested by the Claimants. The BIT standard of compensation for expropriation is entirely in line with the principle of full reparation, since in modern economics the value of an asset captures the expected profits that the asset can generate.319 Since the value of the expropriated asset already includes all possible future profits, adding further elements to the valuation, as the Claimants and their expert do, results in double-counting and overcompensation.\n\nRCM, \u00b6\u00b6 551-553; *Tenaris S.A. and Talta - Trading e Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal Lda. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela II*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/23, Award, 12 December 2016, RL-104, \u00b6\u00b6 396-397.\n\n387.\n\nAccording to Hungary, Mr. Gilbey did not seek to determine the market value of the expropriated leasehold rights but chose, instead, to value the entire farming business by comparing the actual with the but-for value of the Farm. While Mr. Gilbey suggests that by this method he valued the Claimants' leasehold rights, he does not explain why the result is much higher than the value of the land owned by In\u00edcia. Indeed, on one hand, Mr. Gilbey's documents show that the 105 hectares of land owned by In\u00edcia was worth EUR 6,900 per hectare. On the other hand, Mr. Gilbey values the leasehold rights to the Land at EUR 15,650 to EUR 18,867 per hectare.320 This is a clear overstatement.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 515; Versant Second ER, \u00b6 45.\n\n388.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Gilbey determined the but-for value of the Farm as of July 2015 (*ex ante* basis), while he assessed the actual value of the Farm as at December 2017 (*ex post* basis). Mr. Sequeira explains that this approach is defective as it results in compensating the Claimants by an additional EUR 4,100,000 for market factors that impacted the value after the alleged breaches and are wholly unrelated to them.321\n\nVersant Second ER, \u00b6 59.\n\n389.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimants have failed to mitigate the loss by not obtaining a substitute lease for privately owned land. It in particular points to the following contentious facts and evidence:\n\n\u2022 Data obtained from the Hungarian Land Use Registry shows that each year between 2011 and 2015, a substantial amount of agricultural leases had been registered in the area surrounding the farm, meaning that agricultural land often changed lessees. In 2015 alone, new leases were registered for a total of more than 166,000 hectares in the area, for a total of 5,923 registration applications.322\n\n\u2022 The Claimants do not provide evidence that they ever offered a price above market price to secure alternative land. As Mr. Sequeira calculates, even assuming that the Claimants had to pay a 50% premium over their existing rates to secure a substitute rent, the present value of this over-payment for the entire 20-year period of the lease would be EUR 930,000. This is the maximum loss amount that the Claimants may recover.\n\n\u2022 While the Claimants assert that they have partly mitigated the loss by subleasing the State-owned land from the winners of the Tenders, their expert Mr. Gilbey confirms that he did not include this mitigation in his calculation on the purported basis that these quasi sub-lease arrangements \"do not offer security of tenure to Claimants\".323 As Mr. Sequeira notes, this analysis is simply incorrect from an economic perspective and results in overcompensation.324\n\nLand Registry data sheet, Exhibit 15 to Versant Second ER; See Versant Second ER, \u00b6 67.\n\nMazars Second ER, \u00b6 2.4.5(b).\n\nVersant Second ER, \u00b6 69.\n\n390.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Gilbey concludes that the but-for value of the Farm as of July 2015 was EUR 17,600,000 (a reduction of EUR 1,300,000 compared to his first report, as he took several criticisms of Mr. Sequeira into account). Yet, Mr. Sequeira shows that Mr. Gilbey's updated calculation of the but-for value of the Farm remains overstated because it fails to rely on available, appropriate and reliable data regarding milk prices, quantity of privately leased land, livestock prices, overhead costs, fixed and variable costs, and discount rate.325\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 541, citing Versant Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 74-106.\n\n391.\n\nAs for Mr. Gilbey's calculation of the actual value of the Farm, his estimate is between EUR 5,600,000 and EUR 7,700,000 million depending on which of his three alternative approaches of the actual value of the farm is adopted: (i) December 2017 going concern; (ii) July 2015 going concern and (iii) break up basis. Mr. Sequeira disagrees with each of these three alternative valuations for the following reasons:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Gilbey's projection of the Farm's future potato production is understated and inconsistent with the Farm's actual performance.326\n\n\u2022 Mr. Gilbey's assumptions of arable farming costs erroneously excludes the portion of State land that Claimants continue to use to grow crops on a \"quasi-subletting\" basis.327\n\n\u2022 Mr. Gilbey does not adequately support his assumptions regarding which costs are fixed costs.328\n\n\u2022 Mr. Gilbey erroneously applies an illiquidity discount to the actual value of the Farm.329\n\nVersant Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 112-116.\n\nVersant Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 117-119.\n\nVersant Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 120-122.\n\nVersant Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 123-134.\n\n392.\n\nAs for the Claimants' alleged costs of litigation in Hungary, the Respondent contends that such costs are \"too remote to be compensable in this arbitration.\"330 More precisely, the Respondent points to the fact that the Claimants do not challenge the Hungarian court proceedings as part of the expropriation claim. In any event, Mr. Gilbey has included the litigation costs in his valuation twice. He has subtracted these costs from the but-for value of the Farm (thus increasing the but-for value) but not from the actual value. Hence, the claimed difference between the but-for and the actual values includes the litigation costs. If these costs are awarded separately on top of the compensation for the loss of the value of the Farm, this will clearly result in double recovery.\n\nR-Rejoinder, \u00b6 547.\n\n393.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimants' proposed interest rate of 7.87% compounded semi-annually is grossly inflated. This historical rate of return is at odds with the BIT's requirement of a \"normal commercial rate\". Multiple investment tribunals have held that applying a reasonable commercial rate results in full compensation.331 By applying the commercial return rate, Mr. Gilbey assumed that the Claimants would have invested the compensation amount in a successful venture. He did not account for the risk that the venture may have failed and that the Claimants may have lost the entire amount of the compensation. It is for this reason that valuation theory suggests adopting a risk-free rate for pre-award interest.332 In any event, the historic returns of the Claimants' shareholders were in Hungarian currency. Applying this HUF-denominated rate to a Euro-denominated claim is an obvious fallacy, for which Mr. Gilbey has no convincing explanation.333\n\n*BG Group Plc. v.

Mr. Sequeira proposes two alternatives.\n\n395.\n\nFirst, he follows Mr. Gilbey's approach in that he values the Claimants' loss by subtracting the actual value of the Claimants' farm from its but-for value. Doing so, he corrects the alleged errors and inadequacies in Mr. Gilbey's methodology and arrives at two alternative figures: EUR 5,635,621 if the *ex ante* approach is adopted, with the date of valuation in July 2015,334 or EUR 4,487,148 if the *ex post* approach is adopted, with the date of valuation in December 2017.335\n\nSee the table at R-Rejoinder, para 575.\n\nSee the table at R-Rejoinder, para 576.\n\n396.\n\nSecond, as an alternative approach, Mr. Sequeira calculated the fair market value of the Claimants' alleged leasehold rights, without accounting for other consequential losses. To do so, he (i) took as a proxy the value of 105 hectares of land *owned* by In\u00edcia, which he then (ii) adjusted to account for the difference between the value of owned land and the value of the leasehold rights. Under this approach, Mr. Sequeira determined the value of leasehold rights and thus the Claimants' loss at a maximum EUR 3,100,000.336\n\nVersant Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 180-181.\n\n397.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the second alternative approach should be preferred, since Article 6 of the BIT only requires the State to compensate for the expropriated investment itself and not for remote consequential damages.\n\n**C. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n398.\n\nIn the section on liability above, the Tribunal held that Hungary violated Article 6 of the BIT by expropriating the Claimants' vested statutory pre-lease right without compensation. This prevented the Claimants from exercising the pre-lease right in 2014 when the NLA alienated the Land through the Tenders. Had the Claimants exercised the pre-lease right, they would, in all likelihood, have matched the offers made by the winner of the tenders and would thus have obtained a 20-year extension of the Lease. Therefore, the Claimants lost their leasehold entitlement to the Land as a direct consequence of Hungary's expropriatory measure.\n\n399.\n\nThe Parties dispute the valuation of that loss. The Tribunal will first select the appropriate method of valuation (1). It will then analyze the divergences between the valuation experts (2). Thereafter, it will address mitigation (3) and interest (4).\n\n400.\n\nBefore doing so, however, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants request compensation jointly, without specifying that compensation should go to one or the other among them. The Respondent has not objected to this formulation of the Claimants' request for relief. In principle, the amount of compensation for the expropriation of the pre-lease right would pertain to the Claimant that held that right, *i.e.* to In\u00edcia Zrt. However, Article 6.2 of the BIT gives the shareholder investors a right to be compensated for the expropriation of the assets of their subsidiaries:\n\nWhere a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company which is constituted or incorporated under the law in force in any part of its own territory, and in which investors of the other Contracting Party own shares, it shall ensure that the provisions of paragraph I of this Article [i.e. the provision on expropriation] are applied to the extent necessary to guarantee prompt, adequate and effective compensation in respect of their investment to such investors of the other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.337\n\nUK-Hungary BIT, CL-1.\n\n401.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal will grant compensation to the Claimants jointly. The award will reestablish the Claimants in the position in which they would be had Hungary provided compensation for its expropriatory measure as required by Article 6 of the BIT.\n\n**(1) Method of valuation**\n---------------------------\n\n402.\n\nIn order to determine the value of the expropriated leasehold rights on the date of the expropriation (*i.e.* the eviction from the Land in July 2015), the Claimants' valuation expert Mr. Gilbey subtracts the value of the Farm without the Lease (actual value) from the value of the Farm with the Lease (but-for value). The Respondent's valuation expert Mr. Sequeira agrees in principle that, \"the lost value of the leasehold rights could be quantified by comparing the value of the Farm with and without those rights\", adding that \"the difference in the value of the Farm with and without the leasehold rights is equal to the lost value of those rights.\"338 However, he proposes to value the leasehold right by reference to ownership, taking into account that a freehold ownership is in general more valuable than a leasehold.\n\nVersant First ER, \u00b6 46.\n\n403.\n\nThe Tribunal will start by analyzing Mr. Sequeira's proposed approach using freehold ownership as a proxy to value the lost Lease. While valuation by reference to a proxy can be acceptable in certain circumstances, it is undisputed that enterprises and foreign nationals cannot own agricultural land in Hungary. Thus, the market for freeholds is far more limited than for leaseholds, a factor that Mr. Sequeira ignores.\n\n404.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Sequeira's valuation of ownership appears insufficiently substantiated. Indeed, it relies on a single transaction based on a letter of valuation provided in 2018 by Terravost to the Claimants, which referred to a sale of 105 hectares of the Claimants' land. The letter specifies that Terravost \"have not had time to investigate other specific comparables\".339 The Tribunal is not convinced that this only transaction is a sufficient comparator to adopt Mr. Sequeira's valuation. Having discarded Mr. Sequeira's approach, the Tribunal must review the Claimants' valuation method. As mentioned earlier, the Claimants' expert Mr. Gilbey presented the Tribunal with three alternative valuations: (i) a DCF valuation on a going concern basis as of July 2015 but using data of December 2017; (ii) a DCF valuation on a going concern basis as of July 2015 with the data available at that time; and (iii) a valuation whereby the Farm's actual value is determined assuming the breakup of the Farm into constituent assets and is then subtracted from the but-for value which is in turn assessed on a going concern basis.\n\nExhibit 5.1 to Mazars First ER, p. 6.\n\n405.\n\nFor the first approach, Mr. Gilbey calculated the difference between the but-for and the actual values of the Farm in July 2015. However, instead of projecting the cash flows based on the data forecasts (*e.g.* for milk prices) available at that date, he used the market data that was available in December 2017. At the Hearing, Mr. Gilbey conceded that, while he used the 2017 data for determining the actual value of the Farm, he did not do so with respect to the but-for value.340 Neither Mr. Gilbey nor the Claimants have offered a plausible explanation for this inconsistency. It is uncontroversial that the fair market value of an asset is a price at which the asset would change hands between a willing seller and a willing buyer in an arm's length transaction. Evidently, the buyer would only have access to the data available as of the valuation date, *i.e.* here July 2015. The use of data from different dates for the but-for and the actual scenarios distorts the computation and risks reaching results that do not correctly reflect the loss sustained. Consequently, the Tribunal cannot follow this approach.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 451:12-455:11.\n\n406.\n\nMr. Gilbey's secondary valuation remedies this inconsistency and uses the data available on the date of valuation for both scenarios. Mr. Sequeira has confirmed that Mr. Gilbey's secondary approach does not contain the contradiction with respect to the choice of the date of the valuation data.341 As for Mr. Gilbey's third approach, he does not sufficiently explain why the value of the Farm, which is currently operating with profit and has a track record, should be determined on a break-up basis.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 560:7-15.\n\n407.\n\nFor this reason, the Tribunal will take Mr. Gilbey's secondary valuation as a starting point for the assessment of the quantum of the Claimants' loss.\n\n**(2) Contentious points of secondary valuation**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n408.\n\nMr. Sequeira's criticism of Mr. Gilbey's second approach hinges on four points,342 summarized in Mr. Gilbey's presentation343 as follows:\n\nVersant Second ER, Appendices M and O.\n\nMazars Hearing Slides, p. 5 (p. 4 in electronic).\n\n409.\n\nThe Tribunal will address each of these points in turn. Before doing so, however, it notes that Mr. Sequeira also criticized Mr. Gilbey's use of what he called outdated forecasts of milk and livestock prices. Yet, Mr. Sequeira admitted that, if these forecasts are applied in both the but-for and actual valuations, then this error would correct itself and have a negligible impact on the final damages figure.344 Since the Tribunal adopted Mr. Gilbey's secondary valuation in which the expert uses the allegedly \"wrong\" prices in both scenarios with the result that this \"mistake\" has minimal effect if any, the Tribunal can dispense with determining whether other milk and livestock prices should be used. Instead, it will concentrate on the four contentious points that impact the damages figure.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 561-562.\n\n410.\n\n**Liquidity discount:** Mr. Gilbey applied a 25% discount on the actual value of the Farm to account for an increased exposure of the Farm to risk factors such as the milk price fluctuations. Mr. Sequeira opines that no such discount is warranted, since the loss of the Land did not render the Claimants' business inherently riskier or less liquid. According to him, the Claimants' business has always been heavily reliant on milk prices.\n\n411.\n\nMr. Sequeira does not appear to dispute that the loss of the Lease increased the Claimants' costs, in particular the cost of the cattle feed.345 Since the eviction, the Claimants have no longer been in a position to produce sufficient quantities of feed to support the Farm and have thus purchased feed on the market. As a result, they have incurred higher costs. Thus, Mr. Gilbey's opinion that, compared to the but-for scenario, in the actual scenario it would take a smaller negative shift in milk or feed prices to put the Claimants out of business appears plausible. This is consistent with Mr. Hunter's testimony that the Claimants are \"waiting for the inevitable moment when the market prices for milk and feed will turn against us\".346 Thus, in principle, the application of some increased risk factor to the actual value of the Farm seems justified.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 611:15-19.\n\nHunter First WS, \u00b6 89.\n\n412.\n\nThat being so, Mr. Gilbey conceded at the Hearing that his choice of a 25% discount rate was not substantiated by evidence or relevant valuation authorities,347 but was based on his subjective judgment:\n\nI think where Versant are correct, at least, is to say that that 25 percent liquidity discount is a subjective number, and I don't hide behind that. It is an area of judgment on my part.348\n\nTranscript, Day 2, pp. 445-448.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 448:13-17.\n\n413.\n\nWhile the Tribunal respects Mr. Gilbey's expertise, it observes that Mr. Sequeira, who is also a seasoned valuation expert, characterized the 25% liquidity discount as unreasonably high and considered that any liquidity discount would be \"marginal\".349 Based on this evidence, the Tribunal determines in its discretion that 5% would be an appropriate measure of discount to reflect the increased liquidity risk that the Farm faces in the actual scenario.\n\nTranscript, Day 4, 902:15-20.\n\n414.\n\n**Discount rate** : The disagreement leading the experts to adopt different discount rates hinges on two elements: base risk rate (*i.e.* risk free rate) and equity risk premium. For the first element, Mr. Gilbey used the Hungarian Government bonds rate of 3%. However, in July 2015 the rate was 3.5%, which is the rate applied by Mr. Sequeira.350 As for the second element, Mr. Gilbey used the equity risk premium for Hungary of 8.5%. In doing so, he admitted that he relied on the lower figure of Professor Damodaran's suggested range for Eastern Europe, since he mistakenly thought that the higher figure included the estimate for Russia, which has a higher country risk.351 Mr. Sequeira in turn took the average of the upper and lower rates proposed by Professor Damodaran as well as the rate suggested by Bloomberg.352 For these reasons, the Tribunal will apply Mr. Sequeira's suggested discount rate of 9.65%, which it deems better substantiated.\n\nVersant Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 101-106; Versant Hearing Slides, p. 13.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 524:14-525:4.\n\nVersant Second ER, \u00b6\u00b6 101-106; Versant Hearing Slides, p. 14.\n\n415.\n\n**Potato production** : Mr. Sequeira criticizes Mr. Gilbey's omission from the actual value of the Farm of the value of 3,200 tons of potatoes that the Claimants produced after the eviction on land they managed to sublease from the new lessees.\n\n416.\n\nIt is common ground between the experts that Mr. Gilbey's secondary valuation assesses the Claimants' loss on an *ex ante* basis, *i.e.* as of the date when expropriation affected the Claimants (July 2015) and with the data available at that time. If, in the years subsequent to the expropriation, the Claimants managed to grow potatoes on substitute land, this would not affect the value of the expropriated asset at the time of the expropriation. Indeed, a willing buyer would not have factored these revenues in its assessment of the Farm's value in July 2015.\n\n417.\n\nIn any event, as Mr. Gilbey rightly points out, the quasi-sublease arrangements do not provide legal security comparable to that of ownership or a lease. It would thus be unreasonable to project that the Claimants will benefit from this arrangement for 20 years. No reasonable buyer would have made such a projection, given the uncertain nature of the sublease.\n\n418.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal does not share Mr. Sequeira's criticism of Mr. Gilbey's secondary valuation in respect of potato production.\n\n419.\n\n**Potato energy:** Mr. Sequeira further criticized Mr. Gilbey's calculation of the actual value of the Farm on the basis that Mr. Gilbey inappropriately assumed that the production costs, such as the costs of the energy for packing the potatoes, would remain fixed, even though the production would decrease. Although he did not elaborate further, because this issue was \"less material\",353 Mr. Gilbey acknowledged in his slide presentation that potato energy costs are variable, albeit not in a precise correlation with production levels.354 Consequently, the Tribunal cannot follow Mr. Gilbey's assumption that the potato energy costs would remain fixed in spite of the decrease in production. It will thus adopt Mr. Sequeira's valuation in this respect.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 459:2-9.\n\nMazars Hearing Slides, p. 12.\n\n420.\n\nIn summary, Mr. Gilbey's secondary valuation figure of EUR 9,937,495 must be reduced by the amounts resulting from (i) the excess liquidity discount of EUR 2,054,455 (corresponding to 5% instead of the proposed 25% discount), (ii) the discount rate of EUR 659,091 and (iii) the potato energy costs of EUR 75,125, with the result that the damages (corresponding to the fair market value of the expropriated investment) amount to **EUR 7,148,824**.\n\n**(3) Mitigation**\n------------------\n\n421.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants failed to mitigate damages and makes the following alternative prayer for relief:\n\nDeclare that Claimants failed to mitigate their losses and therefore determine that the amount payable by Respondent as compensation cannot exceed EUR 930,000.\n\n422.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants' mitigation efforts after the date of valuation are not relevant. As explained above, a valuation cannot take into account facts that occurred after the valuation date, which a hypothetical buyer could not have considered. The Respondent's expert himself criticized Mr. Gilbey's primary valuation on the basis that it took into account events taking place after the valuation date.355\n\nSequeira Slide Presentation, p. 7.\n\n423.\n\nAt the Hearing, the Respondent linked the obligation to mitigate the loss with an amendment of its request for relief, which it made then asking the Tribunal to:\n\n\u2022 direct Claimants to keep Respondent informed of any sale of the Farm; and\n\n\u2022 subtract from the compensation payable by Respondent all sums Claimants may receive above the Farm's Actual Value (as determined by the Tribunal) in case they sell the Farm before the Award is paid, or\n\n\u2022 order that Claimants shall pay to Respondent all sums Claimants may receive above the Farm's Actual Value (as determined by the Tribunal) in case they sell the Farm after the Award is paid.356\n\nRespondent's letter of 21 June 2019.\n\n424.\n\nOn this occasion, Counsel for the Respondent explained as follows:\n\nI would just ask you to order them that, if they sell the Farm for more than the Actual Value in the calculation, then they have mitigated their loss by selling for more than what they've submitted the Actual Value of the Farm was, and anything they that they obtain above the Actual Value should be subtracted as further mitigation.357\n\nTranscript, Day 4, 963:4-10.\n\n425.\n\nSubject to the admissibility of the amendment by the Respondent of its requests for relief, which can be left open in light of the considerations that follow, these new requests are in any event not well-founded. As set out above, events taking place after the date of valuation are irrelevant. Indeed, a willing buyer of the Farm could not have factored into his/her valuation on July 2015 changes in value due to the Claimants' later failure to mitigate losses.\n\n426.\n\nIn addition, granting the Respondent's new requests would run counter to the Tribunal's duty under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention to decide the dispute, and to do so in a definitive and efficient manner. Ordering the Claimants to keep the Respondent informed of any subsequent sale of the Farm and to refund sales proceeds would not put an end to this dispute. Such an order may give rise to further disagreements over which the Tribunal would arguably have no jurisdiction, it being *functus officio*. It could thus not assist the Parties anymore in resolving these new difficulties. Creating such a situation would be contrary to the Tribunal's duty.\n\n427.\n\nFinally and in any event, the Tribunal notes that the record contains ample evidence of the Claimants' multiple efforts to mitigate the consequences of the loss of access to the land.358 This is not a surprise as mitigating the loss was primarily in the Claimants' interest. Absent compelling evidence to the contrary, the Tribunal is not prepared to speculate whether the Claimants should have exercised a better business judgment, for instance, by growing certain crops on specific parcels of land.359\n\n*Supra* \u00b6 376; Hunter First WS, \u00b6 92-98.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 587:22-588:5.\n\n428.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal will not reduce the amount of compensation on the basis of the alleged lack of mitigation, with the result that the relevant requests for relief of the Respondent are dismissed.\n\n**(4) Interest**\n----------------\n\n429.\n\nThe Claimants seek pre- and post-award interest at the rate of 7.87%, suggested by their expert Mr. Gilbey, while the Respondent's expert, Mr. Sequeira proposes applying LIBOR +2%. For the following reasons, the Tribunal will adopt Mr. Sequeira's rate.\n\n430.\n\nThe Tribunal has not heard from the Claimants a convincing response to Mr. Sequeira's criticism that the historic returns of the Claimants' shareholders were in Hungarian currency, and applying this HUF-denominated rate to a Euro-denominated claim would not be appropriate.\n\n431.\n\nAs for Mr. Sequeira's proposal of LIBOR +2%, the Tribunal in principle agrees that this corresponds to the time value of money that would compensate the Claimants for their loss. It also constitutes a \"normal commercial rate\" as envisaged by Article 6 of the BIT. Investment treaty tribunals often use floating interbank offered rates augmented with a certain premium as an accurate indication of the market value of money in a specific currency.360\n\nSee, e.g., *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 28 September 2007, RL-103, \u00b6 486; *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Award, 25 May 2004, CL-31, \u00b6 250; *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008, \u00b6 314;\n\n432.\n\nThat said, as Mr. Sequeira acknowledged in response to the Tribunal's question, LIBOR is likely to be phased out in 2022,361 with the result that the computation of interest may be rendered impossible beyond that date. For this reason, the Tribunal will instead opt for a comparable rate of 6-month EURIBOR +2%, compounded semi-annually. Interest will run from the date of valuation (July 2015) until the date of the payment. Given that the rate is for a 6-month maturity period, it should be compounded semi-annually.362\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 616:12-22.\n\nThe Respondent has not in principle objected to compounding.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n433.\n\nEach Party seeks an award of the entirety of the costs related to this arbitration, including the legal fees and expenses incurred in connection with these proceedings. They do not dispute that the Tribunal enjoys broad discretion to allocate the costs of the arbitration, as it deems appropriate pursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n434.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants' claim was for approximately EUR 17.9 million, out of which the Tribunal awards approximately EUR 7.1 million. Yet, the ratio of 17.9 to 7.1 is only one element to consider. The Respondent also raised preliminary objections, which the Tribunal denied. In addition, the Tribunal upheld the Claimants' claim of expropriation and found the Respondent liable. This outcome shows that the Claimants had no choice but to initiate this arbitration to vindicate their rights under the BIT, a factor that must also be taken into consideration when assessing costs.\n\n435.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal acknowledges that both Parties and their counsel conducted these proceedings in a professional and efficient manner. The Parties' procedural conduct can thus not influence the allocation of costs.\n\n436.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD): Arbitrators' fees and expenses\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler | 130,308.53 |\n| Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov | 77,891.83 |\n| Dr. Inka Hanefeld | 92,845.83 |\n| Mr. David Kachvani's fees and expenses | 74,021.05 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 126,000 |\n| Direct expenses (estimated) | 63,381.55 |\n| **Total** | **564,448.79** |\n\n437.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.363 As a result, each Party's share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 282,224.40.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n438.\n\nConsidering the factors mentioned above, in the exercise of its discretion, the Tribunal determines that the Respondent shall reimburse the Claimants for the expended portion of the Claimants' advances to ICSID in the amount of USD 282,224.40, for the ICSID lodging fee in the amount of USD 25,000 and for 50% of the Claimants' representation costs in the amount of GBP 296,456, EUR 19,473 and HUF 26,495,585.5.364 The Tribunal notes that the Claimants' costs appear reasonable as they constitute approximately 5% of the amount in dispute and are significantly lower than the Respondent's costs.\n\nClaimants' Statement of Costs.\n\n439.\n\nThis finding does not concern the fees and expenses of the local proceedings in Hungary. The subject matter of those proceedings were not the Claimants' rights under the BIT. In particular, there is no claim of judicial impropriety or denial of justice. Nor did those proceedings concern the validity or lawfulness of the 2011 Amendment, which the Tribunal found to be contrary to the BIT. Instead, those proceedings related to the Claimants' contractual dispute with the NLA. As a result, these costs are not recoverable in this arbitration.\n\n440.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal will give post-award interest on costs, but no pre-award interest. Indeed, costs only become due from the issuance of this award and, hence, it would not be justified to allow for interest to run before that date.\n\n**VIII. OPERATIVE PART**\n------------------------\n\n441.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders the following final award:\n\ni. The present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Center and the competence of the Tribunal;\n\nii. Hungary breached Article 6.1 of the BIT by expropriating the Claimants' investment without compensation;\n\niii. The Respondent shall pay to the Claimants compensation for the expropriation in the amount of **EUR 7,148,824**, plus interest at the rate of 6-month EURIBOR +2% compounded semi-annually, from 1 August 2015 until payment;\n\niv. The Respondent shall reimburse the Claimants for the ICSID and Tribunal costs in the amount of **USD 282,224.40,** for the ICSID lodging fee in the amount of **USD 25,000** and for the Claimants' legal costs in the amount of **GBP 296,456**, **EUR 19,473** and **HUF 26,495,585.5**, which amounts shall bear interest at the rate of 6-month EURIBOR +2% compounded semi-annually, from the date of this Award until payment;\n\nv.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis annulment concerns an application for annulment of the award rendered on November 13, 2019 between Magyar Farming Company Limited, Kintyre Kft and In\u00edcia Zrt and Hungary (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/27) (the \"Award\") by a tribunal composed of Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, as President, Dr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov and Dr. Inka Hanefeld (the \"Tribunal\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Application for annulment was filed by Hungary (the \"Respondent\" or the \"Applicant\") against Magyar Farming Company Limited, Kintyre Kft and In\u00edcia Zrt (the \"Claimants\"). The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"Parties\". The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n3.\n\nThe Award decided a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") on the basis of the Agreement between the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Hungarian People's Republic for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, dated March 9, 1987 (the \"BIT\" or \"Treaty\") and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the \"ICSID Convention\").\n\n4.\n\nAs described in the Award, the dispute in the original proceeding related to Hungary's measures regulating possession and disposal of State-owned agricultural land, which, according to the Claimants, resulted in the expropriation of their leasehold rights to 760 hectares of State-owned land located in Hungary's North-Western region of Ikr\u00e9ny (the \"Land\") and in a diminution of the value of their farming business in Hungary1.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 5.\n\n5.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal found that (i) it had jurisdiction over the dispute; (ii) the Respondent breached Article 6(1) of the BIT by expropriating the Claimants' investment without compensation; (iii) the Respondent should pay EUR 7,148,824 (plus interest) as compensation for expropriation and reimburse the Claimants for the costs of arbitration and their legal costs (plus interest)2.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 441.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent applied for annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, identifying three grounds for annulment: (i) manifest excess of powers (Article 52(1)(b))3; (ii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d))4; and (iii) the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e))5.\n\nApplication, paras 47-94.\n\nApplication, paras 95-105.\n\nApplication, paras 106-124.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn March 12, 2020, ICSID received an application for the annulment of the Award (dated March 11, 2020) from Hungary (the \"Annulment Application\"). The Annulment Application also contained a request under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"ICSID Arbitration Rules\") for the stay of the enforcement of the Award (the \"Request for Stay\").\n\n8.\n\nOn March 19, 2020, pursuant to Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary- General of ICSID registered the Annulment Application. On the same date, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 54(2).\n\n9.\n\nOn June 1, 2020, the *ad hoc* Committee (the \"Committee\") was constituted in accordance with Article 53 of the ICSID Convention. Its members are Prof. Genevi\u00e8ve Bastid Burdeau, a national of France, serving as President of the Committee, Mr. Manuel Conthe, a national of Spain, and Mr. Michael Nolan, a national of the United States of America. On the same date, the Parties were notified that Dr. Laura Bergamini, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 18, 2020, the Committee invited Hungary to confirm whether it maintained its request for stay of enforcement of the Award. Hungary confirmed that it did on June 25, 2020.\n\n11.\n\nOn June 26, 2020, the Committee invited the Parties to confer and agree upon a briefing schedule to address the Request for Stay and ruled that the provisional stay of enforcement was to continue until it could hear the Parties at the first session and reach a final determination on the Request.\n\n12.\n\nOn July 1, 2020, the Claimants informed the Committee that the Parties could not reach an agreement on the schedule to brief the Request for Stay and transmitted the relevant correspondence exchanged by the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nOn July 3, 2020, the Committee took note that the Parties agreed to exchange one round of written submissions on the Request for Stay and to have oral arguments at the first session but disagreed about the time limits for their respective written submissions. Having considered the Parties' proposals, the Committee established the schedule to address the Request for Stay. It also informed the Parties that they would be afforded the opportunity to make further observations on the Request for Stay during the first session.\n\n14.\n\nOn July 14, 2020, the Respondent filed a request for the continued stay of enforcement of the Award along with exhibits R-46 and R-47 and legal authorities RL-112 through RL-123.\n\n15.\n\nOn July 24, 2020, the Claimants submitted their observations on the Applicant's request for continuation of the stay of enforcement, along with exhibits C-256 through C-262 and legal authorities CL-76 through CL-87.\n\n16.\n\nOn July 28, 2020, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 53 and 13(1), the Committee held a first session and a hearing on the stay of enforcement with the Parties by telephone conference. During the session, the Committee and the Parties discussed draft Procedural Order No. 1, transmitted to them on June 18, 2020. The Parties also presented oral pleadings on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, which were recorded.\n\n17.\n\nFollowing the first session, on August 1, 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1, providing, *inter alia*, directions on the conduct of the annulment proceeding and setting forth the procedural calendar of the proceeding.\n\n18.\n\nOn September 11, 2020, the Committee issued a Decision on the Applicant's request for the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award, by which it decided that the stay of enforcement would unconditionally continue pending a decision on the Annulment Application. The Committee reserved its decision on costs for a later stage of the proceeding.\n\n19.\n\nOn October 19, 2020, Hungary filed its Memorial on Annulment, along with exhibits R-01 through R-05 and legal authorities RL-01 through RL-54.\n\n20.\n\nOn January 29, 2021, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Annulment, along with exhibits C-01 through C-16 and legal authorities CL-01 through CL-45.\n\n21.\n\nOn February 17, 2021, the European Commission (\"EC\") filed an Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party along with Annex 1 (the \"EC Application\"). The EC argued that its intervention would assist the Committee by bringing a \"*perspective, particular knowledge or insight that is different from that of the disputing parties concerning the EU Treaties*\"6.\n\nEC Application, para 17.\n\n22.\n\nOn February 18, 2021, the Committee invited the Parties to provide their comments on the EC Application.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants and the Respondent submitted their comments on the EC Application on February 22 and 25, 2021, respectively.\n\n24.\n\nOn March 12, 2021, Hungary submitted its Reply on Annulment, along with exhibit R-06, legal authorities RL-55 through RL-68 and legal authority RL-24 (resubmitted).\n\n25.\n\nOn March 22, 2021, the Committee issued its Decision on the EC Application, granting the European Commission leave to submit a written submission on the issues mentioned at paragraphs 23 and 25 of its Application.\n\n26.\n\nOn March 29, 2021, the European Commission submitted its *amicus curiae* brief.\n\n27.\n\nOn April 12, 2021, Hungary submitted its comments on the EC *amicus curiae* brief.\n\n28.\n\nOn April 13, 2021, the Claimants informed the Committee that they did not intend to file any comments on the EC *amicus curiae* brief.\n\n29.\n\nOn April 23, 2021, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Annulment, along with factual exhibit C-17 and legal authorities CL-46 and CL-47.\n\n30.\n\nOn May 11, 2021, the Committee held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference. During the pre-hearing organizational meeting, the Parties discussed a number of matters relating to the upcoming hearing, including whether the hearing should be held remotely or in-person.\n\n31.\n\nOn May 20, 2021, the Claimants requested leave to refer to certain documents filed in the arbitration proceeding in their opening PowerPoint presentation.

SUMMARY OF THE AWARD**\n-----------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn the framework of the agricultural land regulation in Hungary, a group of British farming professionals led by [REDACTED] invested in 1997 in the agricultural sector purchasing a farm held by In\u00edcia Zrt in the region of Ikr\u00e9ny, through Magyar Farming Company, a holding incorporated in the United Kingdom, and its Hungarian subsidiary, Kintyre Kft, which acquired 95,13% of the shares of In\u00edcia. Among its assets, In\u00edcia retained since the privatization in 1994 a leasehold right over 760 hectares, with both contractual and statutory pre-lease rights to the Land. In keeping with the agricultural land regulation in Hungary, lessees were entitled, at the expiration of the lease, to be informed by landlords about any offer from a third party that they intended to accept and to match and assume the offer of the third party and thereby create a lease contract between the landlord and the holder of the pre-lease right upon the terms offered by the third party.\n\n46.\n\nAfter several successive versions of the land regulation following political changes in Hungary, an amendment to the 2010 Act adopted by the Parliament on July 9, 2011 precluded the exercise of the statutory pre-lease rights in cases where State-owned land had been leased through a tender (\"2011 Amendment\"). The Claimants, whose lease was due to expire on July 25, 2014, unsuccessfully tried to take advantage of a 2013 Amendment to the 2010 Act. The 2013 Amendment had relaxed the 2011 text in granting the National Land Agency (\"NLA\") a discretionary power to extend the duration of existing leases for lessees who benefited from European or national subsidies until they discharged their subsidy obligations. Despite diplomatic interventions and domestic judicial proceedings initiated by In\u00edcia, the takeover of the Land took place on October 16, 2014. After the eviction, In\u00edcia continued farming activities on the land that it owned or leased from private owners.\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimants submitted the dispute to ICSID on the basis of the BIT. This followed unsuccessful attempts by the Parties to settle their dispute amicably, during which the Claimants had contended that the farm was unsaleable, and the Respondent had contended that the Claimants continued to derive profit from their Hungarian farm.\n\n48.\n\nThe Tribunal had to address two jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent. The first (i) was grounded on the alleged absence of a valid consent to arbitrate as provided by Article 8 of the BIT due to it having been rendered inapplicable as a result of Hungary's accession to the European Union in 2004. The second jurisdictional objection (ii) was that the dispute did not arise from an \"*investment*\". The Award rejected both objections.\n\n49.\n\n(i) On the intra-EU objection, the European Commission had filed an application to intervene as a non-disputing party and had been granted leave to submit an *amicus curiae* brief. The Tribunal, after having examined the scope of the decision rendered by the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"CJEU\") on March 6, 2018 in the case *Slovak Republic v. Achmea B.V.* (\"*Achmea* Decision\"), the European Union Member States' 2019 Declaration (\"2019 Declaration\") and the impact of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (\"TFEU\") provisions on the application of Article 8 of the BIT9, concluded \"*that at the time of the initiation of these proceedings the BIT's offer to arbitrate was standing and that a valid arbitration agreement was formed when the Claimants accepted this offer, thus creating the consent to arbitrate required under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention*\"10. The Tribunal's detailed analysis of the intra-EU objection begins at paragraph 200 of the Award, and \u2013 because this annulment proceeding fundamentally concerns it \u2013 the principal points of that analysis are summarized below.\n\na. The Tribunal, when assessing the question of whether the EU Treaties overrode the dispute resolution clause contained in Article 8 of the BIT, did so under international law, because, in its view, the BIT containing Hungary's consent to arbitration is an international treaty and, as such, interpretation was governed by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"VCLT\"), to which both Hungary and the United Kingdom are parties11.\n\nb. The Tribunal viewed itself to be \"*the judge of its own competence*\" pursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, and the Tribunal accordingly did not considered itself to be bound by the *Achmea* Decision. In the further judgement of the Tribunal, the interpretative authority of the CJEU extends to the interpretation and application of the EU Treaties, but not to the interpretation of the BIT or the VCLT, that the Tribunal understood to be applicable12.\n\nc. In the judgement of the Tribunal, the BIT remained in force notwithstanding the *Achmea* Decision, for the following reasons:\n\n[\u2026] the UK and Hungary have not terminated the BIT pursuant to the rules of Section 3 of the VCLT. Even if they had done so by virtue of the 2019 Declarations, however, the Claimants accepted the BIT's offer to arbitrate prior to its purported termination. Pursuant to Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, \"[w]hen the parties [i.e. the investor and the State] have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\" Indeed, it is common ground between the Parties that the relevant time for determining jurisdiction is the date of the initiation of the arbitration13.\n\nd. The Tribunal also referenced the 20-year sunset provision of the BIT, stating as follows:\n\nIf the protection of existing investments outlives an unambiguous termination of the Treaty, then the protection must continue *a fortiori* in respect of a decision of an adjudicatory body constituted under a different treaty or of declarations that purport to clarify the legal consequences of that decision14.\n\ne. In the Tribunal's view, \"[f]*or these reasons, the 2019 Declarations cannot retroactively invalidate or render inapplicable the offer to arbitrate that the Claimants accepted through their request for arbitration*\"15.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 200-247.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 248.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 203. The Award at paragraph 237 sets forth Article 42(1) of the VCLT, which states that \"*the validity of a treaty or of the consent of a State to be bound by a treaty may be impeached only through the application of the present Convention*\".\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 209.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 213.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 223.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 224.\n\n50.\n\nThe Tribunal then proceeded to consider Hungary's argument, in reliance on the conflict rules of Article 30 of the VCLT, that Articles 26716 and 34417 of the TFEU \"*override Article 8 of the BIT*\"18:\n\nArticle 30 of the VCLT sets forth rules to resolve conflicts between successive treaties that govern the same subject matter. It is in relevant part as follows:\n\nArticle 30\n\nApplication of successive treaties relating to the same subject matter\n\n1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the following paragraphs.\n\n2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions of that other treaty prevail.\n\n3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under Article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty.\n\n4. When the parties to the later treaty do not include all the parties to the earlier one:\n\n(a) as between States parties to both treaties the same rule applies as in paragraph 3;\n\n(b) as between a State party to both treaties and a State party to only one of the treaties, the treaty to which both States are parties governs their mutual rights and obligations19.\n\nArticle 267 of the TFEU reads as follows: \"*The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings concerning: a) the interpretation of the Treaties; b) the validity and interpretation of acts of institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the Union*\".\n\nArticle 344 of the TFEU reads as follows: \"*Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other that those provided for therein*\".\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 225 *et seq*.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 225.\n\n51.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal,\n\ninvestment jurisprudence is consistent in holding that investment treaties do not share the same subject matter with the EU Treaties. By contrast, the *Achmea* Decision is silent on whether intra-EU investment treaties and the TFEU govern the same subject matter for the purposes of Article 30 of the VCLT20.\n\nThe Tribunal saw no reason to diverge from the consistent line of investment awards according to which the EU Treaties and investment treaties do not share the same subject matter. Consequently, the Tribunal ruled that the conflict rules embodied in Article 30 of the VCLT did not apply to possible conflicts between the BIT and the EU Treaties21.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 231.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 236.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal summarized its analysis as follows:\n\nFor these reasons, the conclusions that the BIT and the EU Treaties do not have the same subject matter and thus Article 30 of the VCLT does not apply dispose of the question whether the BIT's offer to arbitrate was valid and applicable at the commencement of this arbitration. The analysis could stop here22.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 238.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal could have stopped there but it considered that even if the BIT and the EU Treaties, as Hungary had argued, were regarded as having the same subject matter, there is no conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and Articles 267\u00a0and 344\u00a0of the TFEU23. The Tribunal considered that \"*when States subscribe to successive treaties without terminating or amending any of them, it should be presumed that they did not intend to create a normative contradiction*\"24. Since Article 344 does not limit or prohibit the submission of disputes to an investment treaty body, but limits the power of Member States to litigate disputes concerning the interpretation of the EU Treaties by means other than those provided in the EU Treaties, and as the present dispute does not call for the interpretation or application of the EU Treaties, at the time the Claimants commenced this proceeding the BIT's offer to arbitrate was valid in respect of the subject-matter scope of the present dispute. As for Article 267 TFEU, it does not create an obligation for the Member States that each and every adjudicatory body applying EU law may seek a preliminary ruling from the CJEU25. This analysis does not make express reference to Article 351 of the TFEU26, which the Award mentions only when summarizing the Parties' positions27, and this, as will be explained, is a matter of significance to Hungary in this annulment proceeding.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 239.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 240.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 239-247.\n\nArticle 351 of the TFEU reads as follows: \"*The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before 1 January 1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Treaties. To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with the Treaties, the Member States or States concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established. Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end and shall, where appropriate, adopt a common attitude. In applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraphs, Member States shall take into account the fact that the advantages accorded under the Treaties by each Member State form an integral part of the establishment of the Union and are thereby inseparably linked with the creation of common institutions, the conferring of powers upon them and the granting of the same advantages by all the other Member States*\".\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 178, 179, 180, 183, and 195.\n\n54.\n\n(ii) On the subject-matter issue, the Tribunal emphasized that the Parties did not dispute that the Claimants' farm was an investment within the meaning of both the ICSID Convention and the BIT, that the dispute arose out of that investment envisaged holistically and that the legal dispute was limited, along with Article 8 of the BIT, to reviewing a breach of Article 6 of the BIT28. Therefore, \"*the disagreement on whether the Claimants held rights capable of being expropriated and whether Hungary's measures were expropriatory constitutes 'a legal dispute rising of Article 6' of the BIT. It thus falls within the Tribunal's jurisdiction pursuant to Article 8 of the BIT*\"29.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 271-280.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 281.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal's discussion of subject-matter jurisdiction began by noting the \"common ground\" between the Parties, as follows:\n\nIt is common ground that the Claimants' farming business in Hungary constitutes an investment within the meaning of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. The Parties disagree, however, on whether the consent to arbitrate 'any legal dispute arising under Article 6 [the expropriation provision]' of the BIT extends to the present dispute and, in particular, whether Hungary's measures were capable of constituting an expropriation of the assets constituting an investment30.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 249 (inserted material in original).\n\n56.\n\nThe Award's summary of the Parties' positions highlights the distinction that Hungary made between the Claimants' farming business and their purported lease rights, and the contended legal significance of that distinction. It states as follows:\n\n250. The Respondent contends that the present dispute does not fall within the subject-matter scope of the BIT's dispute resolution provision, since none of the conduct alleged by the Claimants is capable of constituting an expropriation.\n\n251. First, although the Claimants' farming business in Hungary indisputably constitutes an investment, the farm as a whole is not the subject of the expropriation claim, since the Claimants continue to derive profit from it.\n\n252. Second, the Lease cannot be the subject of an expropriation either, because it expired on 25 July 2014 on its own terms [\u2026]\n\n254. Third, the alleged pre-lease right and right to claim damages for the conduct of the Tenders do not constitute an investment under the BIT and are thus not capable of being expropriated31.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 250-252 and 254 (footnotes omitted).\n\n57.\n\nIn its analysis of subject-matter jurisdiction, the Tribunal proceeded on the basis that \"*the existence of an investment must be assessed holistically*\"32. It identified the following three jurisdictional requirements deriving from Article 25 of the ICSID Convention33 and Article 8(1) of the BIT34:\n\n- The dispute must arise directly out of an investment (Article 25 of the ICSID Convention);\n\n- The dispute must \"concern the investment\" (Article 8(1) of the BIT); and\n\n- The dispute must arise under Article 6, which is the expropriation provision of the BIT (Article 8(1) of the BIT)35*.*\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 274.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows: \"*The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre*\".\n\nArticle 8(1) of the BIT reads as follows: \"*Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes* [\u2026] *for the settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on 18 March 1965 any legal dispute arising under Article 6* [expropriation provision] *of this Agreement between that Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter in the territory of the former* [\u2026]\".\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 272.\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal found the first two requirements to have been met on the basis that the Parties did not dispute that the Claimants' farm was an investment within the meaning of both the ICSID Convention and the BIT36. The Tribunal further found that the present dispute \u2013 which it said \"*concerns the alleged expropriation of the Claimants' leasehold rights*\" \u2013 \"*does arise out of that overall investment of the Claimants*\"37. The Award explains as follows:\n\n277. As for the third requirement, Article 8 of the BIT\u00a0requires that there be 'a legal dispute arising under Article 6'. According to the definition given by the PCIJ in *Mavrommatis*, under international law \"[a] dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or of interests between two persons.\"38 The ICJ also defines a legal dispute broadly as \"a situation in which the two sides hold clearly opposite views concerning the question of the performance or non-performance of certain treaty obligations.\"39\n\n278. Hence, for the Tribunal to have subject-matter jurisdiction under Article 8 of the BIT, it must be satisfied that the Parties are in \"disagreement on a point of law or fact\" concerning Hungary's performance or non-performance under Article 6 of the BIT. When assessing this requirement, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to establish whether the Claimants' assets have actually been expropriated. It is in the nature of a dispute that it may eventually be decided against the Claimants40.\n\nThe Tribunal finally concluded that:\n\nthe disagreement on whether the Claimants held rights capable of being expropriated and whether Hungary's measures were expropriatory constitutes \"a legal dispute arising under Article 6\" of the BIT. It thus falls within the Tribunal's jurisdiction pursuant to Article 8 of the BIT41.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 273.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 273.\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v. Great Britain)*, Judgment of 30 August 1924, 1924 PCIJ Series A, No. 2, p. 11.\n\n*Interpretation of the Peace Treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania*, Advisory Opinion, 30 March 1950 (first phase), ICJ Reports (1950) 65, at p. 74.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 277 -278.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 281.\n\n59.\n\nOn the merits, the Tribunal considered Hungary's measures in terms of expropriation of the statutory pre-lease rights and assessed whether the 2011 Amendment had that effect. It considered undisputed that the lease fulfilled a function like ownership in terms of the investor's expectations of legal certainty and stability and that the deprivation of vested pre-lease rights should have been accompanied by compensation even if the State acted with a legitimate public purpose42. Recognizing that the 2011 Amendment was inspired by Hungary's decision to change its agricultural land holding policy, the Tribunal considered that in doing so the State was required to respect vested rights43. Whether this expropriation had been unlawful was not regarded by the Tribunal as having been raised by the Claimants, because the Claimants requested compensation for the difference in the value of the farm with and without the leasehold rights, which is equal to the lost value of those rights and to the fair market value of the investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation. Accordingly, the Tribunal did not determine whether or not the expropriation had been unlawful.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 360.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 367.\n\n60.\n\nComing to the quantum, the Tribunal having compared the expert evaluations opted for an evaluation presented by the Claimants' expert and addressed secondary points in discussion. The Tribunal reduced the evaluation presented by the Claimants' expert by certain amounts resulting from the level of the liquidity risk discount due to the actual value of the farm, the rate of the risk discount, and the cost of the energy required for packing potatoes. The Tribunal did not take into account, however, the value of potato production on the land that In\u00edcia managed to sublease from the new lessees after the eviction44.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 415-418.\n\n61.\n\nThe Award sets forth in detail, relying heavily upon testimony from [REDACTED], what the Claimants submitted had been their attempts to mitigate losses by trying to lease replacement land and to buy land by bidding at auction as a \"*local farmer*.\" None of those efforts was successful. Ultimately, the Claimants obtained from the winners of the tenders45 only temporary and unnotified sublets for about 107 hectares of the Land they had previously farmed. [REDACTED], the Claimants' expert, did not consider potato production on the sublet land as part of his damages analysis, because \"*these quasi sub-lease* [did] *not offer security of tenure to Claimants*\"46. For Hungary's expert, [REDACTED], [REDACTED]'s analysis was simply incorrect from an economic perspective and resulted in overcompensation47.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 377.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 389.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 389.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal addressed at paragraphs 415 to 418 of the Award the disagreement between the experts concerning potato production on the sublet land. In the Tribunal's assessment, both experts agreed that [REDACTED]'s valuation of the Claimants' loss was made on an *ex ante* basis, meaning as of the date when expropriation affected the Claimants (July 2015) and with the data available at that time. In the Tribunal's view, that Claimants produced potatoes on the sublet land subsequent to the expropriation did not affect the value of the expropriated asset at the time of the expropriation48. Further, the Tribunal stated that [REDACTED] had rightly pointed out that the quasi-sublease arrangements did not provide legal security comparable to that of ownership or a lease, that it would thus be unreasonable to project that the Claimants would benefit from this arrangement for 20 years, and that no reasonable buyer would have made such a projection, given the uncertain nature of the sublease49. For these reasons, the Tribunal said, it \"*does not share Mr. Sequeira's criticism of Mr. Gilbey's secondary valuation in respect of potato production*\"50.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 416.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 417.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 418.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal also dismissed a claim presented by the Respondent during the hearing to reduce the amount of compensation on the basis of alleged lack of mitigation by the Claimants. The Tribunal considered that \"[s]*ubject to the admissibility of the amendment by the Respondent of its request for relief, which can be left open in light of the considerations that follow, these new requests are in any event not well-founded*. *As set out above, events taking place after the date of valuation are irrelevant*\"51.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 425.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal awarded the Claimants compensation for the expropriation of their investment in the amount of EUR 7,148,824.\n\n**IV. THE SCOPE OF ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS IN GENERAL**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe grounds for annulment of an ICSID award are set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention:\n\nEither Party may request annulment by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n66.\n\nThe principles concerning the role and powers of annulment committees in general are summarized in the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment of May 2016 as corresponding to the generally accepted interpretation of the ICSID Convention by *ad hoc* committees, including the present Committee.\n\n(1) the grounds listed in Article 52(1) are the only grounds on which an award may be annulled;\n\n(2) annulment is an exceptional and narrowly circumscribed remedy and the role of an *ad hoc* Committee is limited;\n\n(3) *ad hoc* committees are not courts of appeal, annulment is not a remedy against an incorrect decision, and an *ad hoc* Committee cannot substitute the Tribunal's determination on the merits for its own;\n\n(4) *ad hoc* committees should exercise their discretion not to defeat the object and purpose of the remedy or erode the binding force and finality of awards;\n\n(5) Article 52 should be interpreted in accordance with its object and purpose, neither narrowly nor broadly; and\n\n(6) an *ad hoc* committee's authority to annul is circumscribed by the Article 52 grounds specified in the application for annulment, but an *ad hoc* committee has discretion with respect to the extent of an annulment, i.e., either partial or full52.\n\nUpdated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID, May 5, 2016, **RL-4**, para 74.\n\n67.\n\nThese principles have been recalled by the Claimants in their Counter-Memorial53 and oral pleadings54 without being generally challenged or commented upon by the Respondent, except concerning the limits to the discretionary power of a committee to annul partially or in whole an award, which is discussed in the Reply and will be addressed hereafter55. Rather, the Respondent preferred to concentrate on the interpretation to be given to the specific provisions of Article 52 on which its request for annulment is grounded.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 7-21.\n\nHearing Transcript, 74:19-25, 75:01-25, 76:01-25, 77:01-25, 78:01-25, 79:01-25, 80:01-25.\n\nReply, paras 112-137.\n\n68.\n\nIt must be clarified that an *ad hoc* committee has to survey the overall integrity of the award at the date it was delivered and according to the legal arguments of the parties before the tribunal, notwithstanding any legal change that could have occurred after this date and which could in any manner affect some aspects of the dispute.\n\n**A. The Parties ' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n**(1) Hungary's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n69.\n\nIn its Reply, the Respondent contends first that while *ad hoc* committees enjoy some discretion whether or not to annul sections of the award, this power is not unfettered56 and should not be exercised to the point of defeating the object and purpose of the remedy of annulment. Second, the Respondent affirms that if the tribunal's error materially affects the award as a whole or in part, the *ad hoc* committee has no choice but to annul the affected part of the award in question57: it is not for the Claimants to second guess whether an error on quantum has a \"*minor*\" or \"*major*\" material impact on the Award58.\n\nReply, para 120.\n\nReply, para 123.\n\nReply, para 129.\n\n70.\n\nConcerning the discretion of the Tribunal in determining issues of quantum, Hungary affirms that there exists no legal standard requiring a \"*gross illegitimate*\" error and no basis that only an error that affects the merits of a case or the entirety of the damages analysis would warrant annulment59. According to Hungary, the Tribunal's discretion on quantum issues finds its limits in the Tribunal's duty to abide by basic principles of law, including that of mitigation and full compensation60.\n\nReply, para 134.\n\nReply, para 135.\n\n**(2) The Claimants' Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimants in the Counter-Memorial submit that, even if the Tribunal were guilty of an \"*error of law*\", as claimed by Hungary, any such error was clearly not of such magnitude as to amount to a veritable non-application of the proper law as a whole. It further underlines that Hungary does not contest that the Tribunal applied the first and principal component and only invoked an alleged second component of the mitigation principle, relying on English law but without any reference to international law61. Finally, the Claimants submit that, if the Committee were to consider that the Tribunal's treatment of the \"*second component of the mitigation principle*\" was a manifest excess of powers, this would be a paradigm example of a case in which the Committee should exercise its undoubted discretion not to annul the Award62.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 81.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 86.\n\n72.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, the Claimants contest the reading by Hungary of the decisions in *MINE v. Guinea* and *Tidewater v. Venezuela*, emphasizing that, to the contrary, a committee should annul the affected parts of an award only when the reasoning is contradictory or frivolous63.\n\nRejoinder, para 18.\n\n**B. The Committee ' s Analysis**\n---------------------------------\n\n73.\n\nThe Parties seem to disagree mainly about the margin of discretion of the Committee to decide on partial or total annulment of the Award. It is essential to recall, and both Parties apparently agree on this point, that an annulment proceeding is not an appeal.\n\n74.\n\nIt has permanently been recalled by ICSID, by the doctrine and by all *ad hoc* committees, that pursuant to Article 53 of the ICSID Convention the \"*award shall be binding and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention*\". The consequence of this fundamental character is that the annulment review is an exceptional and limited exercise and does not provide for an appeal of the award or any form of retrial.\n\n75.\n\nConcerning the discretion to annul, Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[*t*]*he Committee shall have the authority to annul the award*\". Along with the ordinary meaning of this sentence *ad hoc* committees have adamantly considered that they have some discretion and are not under the obligation to annul the award even if a ground for annulment listed in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention is found. As stated in *MINE v. Guinea*:\n\nThe Convention does not require automatic exercise of that authority to annul an award whenever a timely application has been made and the applicant has established one of the grounds for annulment [\u2026]64.\n\n*Maritime International Nominees Establishment v. Republic of Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on the application by Guinea for partial annulment of the arbitral award dated January 6, 1988, December 14, 1989, **RL-49** (\"*MINE v. Guinea*\"), para 4.09.\n\n76.\n\nAlong with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, and as it has constantly been recalled since the *MINE v. Guinea* decision, the role of an *ad hoc* committee is to verify the overall integrity and legitimacy of the arbitral process. An annulment proceeding is not concerned with the substantive correctness of the decision, and annulment is not a remedy to correct a mere error. As recently recalled in *Orascom v. Algeria*, with reference to several previous annulment decisions:\n\nIt is not the role of *ad hoc* committees to review tribunals' findings on facts or to control their interpretation of the applicable law65*.*\n\n*Orascom TMT Investments S\u00e0RL v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Decision on annulment, September 17, 2020 (\"*Orascom v. Algeria*\"), para 124; *Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, May 3, 1985, **AL-33**, paras 61 and 128; *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, *Ad hoc* Committee decision on the application for annulment, May 16, 1986, **RL-52** (\"*Amco v. Indonesia*\"), para 23; *CDC Group PLC v. The Republic of Seychelles*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the application for annulment of the Republic of Seychelles, June 29, 2005, **CL-7**, para 45; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the application for annulment of the Argentine Republic, September 25, 2007, **CL-11**, paras 85 and 136; *Tulip Real Estate Investment and Development Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Decision on annulment, December 30, 2015, **RL-12**, para 44.\n\n77.\n\nMoreover, as recently underlined in *Orascom v. Algeria*, along with the ordinary terms of Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee has a discretionary authority to decide on the annulment and is not obliged to do so:\n\nUnder the ordinary meaning of this provision, an *ad hoc* committee has some discretion and is not under an obligation to annul even if it finds that there is a ground for annulment listed in Article 52(1)66.\n\n*Orascom v. Algeria*, para 125.\n\n78.\n\nAs has been clearly summarized in *Soufraki v. UAE*:\n\nAn *ad hoc* committee is responsible for controlling the overall integrity of the arbitral process and may not, therefore, simply determine which party has the better argument. This means that an annulment, as already stated, is to be distinguished from an ordinary appeal, and that, even when a ground for annulment is justifiably found, an annulment need not be the necessary outcome in all circumstances67*.*\n\n*Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v. The United Arab Emirates*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the application for annulment of Mr. Soufraki, June 5, 2007, **RL-6** (\"*Soufraki v. UAE*\"), para 24; *CDC Group PLC v. The Republic of Seychelles*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the application for annulment of the Republic of Seychelles, June 29, 2005, **CL-7**, para 36: \"*This mechanism protecting against errors that threaten the fundamental fairness of the arbitral process (but not against incorrect decisions) arises from the ICSID convention drafter's desire that Awards be final and binding* [\u2026]\"*.*\n\n79.\n\nThe Committee adheres to this well-established position concerning the discretion to annul.\n\n**V. THE GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT ASSERTED BY HUNGARY**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nIn its Annulment Application, Hungary sought annulment of the Award on the basis of a) incorrect analysis of the consequences of the *Achmea* Decision; b) the Tribunal's failure to address one of Hungary's key arguments on the merits of the case; and c) an egregious error by the Tribunal in interpreting and applying the mitigation principle to its damages analysis68. The grounds invoked in the Annulment Application are subparagraphs (b) (manifest excess of power)69, (d) (serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure)70, and (e) (failure to state the reasons on which the award is based) of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention71.\n\nMemorial, para 5.\n\nAnnulment Application, para 47.\n\nAnnulment Application, para 95.\n\nAnnulment Application, para 106.\n\n81.\n\nIn the Memorial as well as in the Rejoinder, however, Hungary invokes only subparagraphs (b) and (e) of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and does not elaborate on the arguments invoked in the Annulment Application under subparagraph (d). Nor has Hungary raised subparagraph (d) in the oral pleadings so that only two grounds of annulment have been advanced. This was also the understanding of the Claimants who, in their written as well as oral pleadings, discussed only subparagraphs (b) and (e) of Article 52. The *ad hoc* Committee therefore considers that only two grounds for annulment of the Award have been advanced by the Applicant and discussed among the Parties, namely manifest excess of power and failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based.\n\n82.\n\nThe points of the Award that are challenged under these two grounds concern, first, the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in consequence of the *Achmea* Decision and, second, the alleged refusal by the Tribunal to apply the principle of mitigation of damages.\n\n**A. Manifest Excess of Power by the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Hungary's Position***\n---------------------------\n\n**i. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n83.\n\nHungary's principal objection in this annulment proceeding is on the basis of the landmark 2018 ruling by the CJEU in *Slovak Republic v. Achmea B.V.* In its *Achmea* Decision, the CJEU ruled as follows:\n\nArticles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept72.\n\nCase C-284/16, *Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV*, March 6, 2018, **AL-14**, para 62.\n\n84.\n\nIn Hungary's submission, the CJEU's ruling in the *Achmea* Decision applies beyond the terms of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, including to Article 8 of the BIT at issue in this arbitration.\n\n85.\n\nHungary maintains in this annulment proceeding that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in wrongly asserting its jurisdiction based on Article 8 of the BIT\u00a0without taking into account the impact of the *Achmea* Decision\u00a0on the legal relationship between Hungary and the United Kingdom, allegedly reinforced by the 2019 Declaration of 22 Member States of the European Union. The analysis of the *Achmea* Decision and the alleged incompatibility of Article 8 of the BIT with the United Kingdom and Hungary's obligations under the EU Treaties were already presented and developed before the Tribunal both by Hungary and by the EU Commission in its *amicus curiae* brief. The Respondent takes over the demonstration already presented before the Tribunal about the analysis, the scope and authority of the *Achmea* Decision73, which should prevail among EU Member States, notwithstanding Brexit74, leading to the affirmation that the arbitration mechanism provided by Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with the international obligations of Hungary under the EU Treaties75.\n\nMemorial, paras 58-89.\n\nMemorial, paras 90-93. Hungary points out that, at the time that the Claimants instituted the arbitration proceeding against Hungary on July 14, 2017, the United Kingdom was an EU Member State, and that the United Kingdom continued to be an EU Member State when the Tribunal rendered its Award on November 13, 2019. For these reasons, Hungary maintains that the BIT constituted an intra-EU BIT between the United Kingdom and Hungary, falling squarely under the scope of application of the *Achmea* Decision, and Brexit should have no bearing upon the contended incompatibility between Article 8 of the BIT and the EU law. *See* Memorial, paras 92-93; Hearing Transcript, 124:08-15: \"*Actually, after Brexit, even the incompatibility between the sole provision of the BIT, Article 8, the dispute resolution clause, and the EU Treaties does not exist anymore, because the UK-Hungary BIT is no longer an intra-EU BIT. That incompatibility arose merely between 2004, when Hungary joined the European Union, and the period when the UK left the European Union, so Brexit marks the end date*\".\n\nMemorial, para 89.\n\n86.\n\nThe Applicant recognizes the principle of *Kompetenz Kompetenz*76, but considers that the Tribunal should have abided by the CJEU's determination of the nature and scope of the Member States' international obligations under the EU Treaties. In Hungary's submission, the authoritative nature of the CJEU's interpretation of the international obligations undertaken by the EU Member States under the EU Treaties results from the application of general principles of international law as to the deference that must be accorded to decisions of permanent jurisdictional bodies77.\n\nMemorial, para 102.\n\nMemorial, para 94.\n\n87.\n\nThus, for Hungary, the Tribunal should not have disregarded the CJEU's interpretation of the obligations arising under the EU Treaties and substituted its own analysis for the CJEU's, as concerns both Articles 344 and 267 of the TFEU78. In substituting its own analysis for that of the CJEU on the proper interpretation of the international law obligations undertaken by the United Kingdom and Hungary under the EU Treaties, Hungary submits that the Tribunal erred in its analysis of the jurisdictional issues put before it, which led to the Tribunal exceeding its powers79.\n\nMemorial, para 100.\n\nMemorial, para 103.\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the 2019 Declaration by the EU Member States was an authoritative and binding interpretation of the BIT under Article 31(3) of the VCLT. For this reason, in the Respondent's view, the Tribunal exceeded its powers by not according effect to this authority80.\n\nMemorial, paras 108-111.\n\n89.\n\nFor Hungary, there are two distinct rules of international law to resolve conflicts between the international law obligations of the United Kingdom and Hungary under the EU Treaties and under the BIT. These rules are primarily Article 35181 of the TFEU \u2013 a special orientation rule \u2013 and the \"residual\" rule expressed in Article 30(3) of the VCLT, which reflects customary international law. In its oral pleadings, Hungary submitted that Article 351 of the TFEU would constitute a *lex specialis* between EU Member States which should have preference over Article 30 of the VCLT82. Considering the conflict between Article 8 of the BIT\u00a0and the *Achmea* Decision, the Respondent reproaches the Tribunal for setting aside the special conflict rule provided in Article 351 of the TFEU and for applying the residual rule of Article 30(3) of the VCLT83. It further contests the way the Tribunal applied this last provision, considering the fact that the BIT is an earlier treaty and that the VCLT applies to successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter, which should have led to the conclusion that the later-in-time treaty should prevail84. In Hungary's view, in its analysis of Article 30(3) of the VCLT, the Tribunal disregarded that the test of \"*relating to the same subject matter*\" has been widely held to be met just by the mere existence of a conflict between the provisions of an earlier and a later treaty (as was the case, in Hungary's view, of the conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and Articles 267\u00a0and 344\u00a0of the TFEU)85.\n\nArticle 351 TFEU: \"*The rights and obligations arising from agreements concluded before 1 January 1958 or, for acceding States, before the date of their accession, between one or more Member States on the one hand, and one or more third countries on the other, shall not be affected by the provisions of the Treaties. To the extent that such agreements are not compatible with the Treaties, the Member State or States concerned shall take all appropriate steps to eliminate the incompatibilities established. Member States shall, where necessary, assist each other to this end and shall, where appropriate, adopt a common attitude*. *In applying the agreements referred to in the first paragraph, Member States shall take into account the fact that the advantages accorded under the Treaties by each Member State form an integral part of the establishment of the Union and are thereby inseparably linked with the creation of common institutions, the conferring of powers upon them and the granting of the same advantages by all the other Member States*\".\n\nHearing Transcript, 17:08-09.\n\nMemorial, paras 113-138.\n\nMemorial, paras 129-132.\n\nMemorial, para 132.\n\n90.\n\nFinally Hungary avers that the Tribunal's jurisdictional error is both \"*evident*\" and \"*serious*\" to warrant the annulment of the Award. For the Applicant, the *Kompetenz Kompetenz* principle, which Hungary accepts, does not mean, however, that the Tribunal's decision is immune from review86 and Hungary argues that the Tribunal's error in refusing to apply the relevant rules is both obvious and serious, justifying the annulment of the Award since there exists no basis to restrict the power of annulment to a failure to apply the applicable law *in toto*87.\n\nReply, para 37.\n\nReply, para 74.\n\n**ii. Mitigation**\n------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal also exceeded its powers by refusing to take account of the Claimants' mitigation efforts in the calculation of damages, thus committing an egregious error. In its Memorial, Hungary contends that misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law may, in particular cases, be so gross or egregious as substantially amount to failure to apply the proper law, warranting annulment of the award on the basis of an excess of power88.\n\nMemorial, para 145.\n\n92.\n\nAccording to the Applicant's position, the duty to mitigate damages is a well-established principle in investment arbitration that imposes, first, that the injured party cannot recover damages in respect of a loss that it could have avoided through reasonable action and, second, that any action taken by the injured party after the breach that results in a reduction of its losses should be taken into account to diminish the breaching party's liability for damages. The Applicant adds that mitigation strictly accords with the principle of full compensation and that \"[d]*amages* [\u2026] *will be overstated if mitigation events are ignored*\"89.\n\nMemorial, para 151.\n\n93.\n\nHungary contends that the Tribunal made an egregious error in not applying the mitigation principle90. The Claimants' expert having recognized that the Claimants had mitigated losses by subletting State-owned land, any profits earned as a result of the subletting should have been taken into account in the calculation of the Claimants' losses91. Hungary acknowledges that the Tribunal seemed to understand the requirement to address mitigation as a separate and subsequent component to the initial value of the Claimants' loss92. The efforts of the Claimants to grow potatoes on sublet land should have, says Hungary, resulted in deducting the profits made on these activities from the calculation of the final amount of damage suffered by the Claimants, the profits being quantified between EUR 375,000 and EUR 390,00093. The Tribunal, having considered that \"*a valuation cannot take into account facts that occurred after the valuation date, which a hypothetical buyer could not have considered*\"94 and consequently confusing, according to Hungary, the issue of the valuation of the asset with the issue of the actual loss suffered by the investor, committed an egregious misapplication of the mitigation principle constituting a manifest, obvious error95 with the consequence that this part of the Award should be annulled96. For Hungary, the Committee has no discretion to refuse to annul this part of the Award, as the Tribunal failed to apply an established legal principle97.\n\nMemorial, para 146.\n\nMemorial, para 158.\n\nMemorial, para 162.\n\nMemorial, paras 167 and 174.\n\nMemorial, para 168, quoting Award, para 422.\n\nMemorial, para 174.\n\nMemorial, paras 176-179.\n\nReply, para 135.\n\n94.\n\nIn its Reply, Hungary used the following heading for its discussion of what it contended to be the Tribunal's manifest excess of power respecting mitigation: \"*B. The Tribunal Manifestly Exceeded its Powers Due to an Egregious Error of Law in the Context of its Damages Analysis*\"98. Hungary stated as follows:\n\nAs Hungary established in the Memorial, the Tribunal further manifestly exceeded its powers in its award of damages by proceeding on the basis of a flagrant and egregious error of the law of damages. This egregious error consisted in the Tribunal's mistaken and illogical confusion of two distinct and separate components of any damages analysis: the *ex ante* valuation of the expropriated asset and the subsequent adjustment of the amount of damages to reflect the Claimants' *ex post* mitigation of their losses99.\n\nIn Hungary's further submission, the Tribunal \"*failed to deduct at least 375,000 euros from the damages awarded to Claimants*\"100, and the Tribunal's \"*egregious error of law led it to award damages in manifest excess of its power, justifying annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention*\"101. The \"*Tribunal's error*\" \u2013 that it \"*confused*\" mitigation of damages and valuation of an asset \u2013 \"*is plainly obvious*\", Hungary submits102.\n\nReply, p. 12.\n\nReply, para 48 (footnotes omitted; emphasis in the original).\n\nReply, para 49.\n\nReply, para 50.\n\nReply, para 51.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n**i. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimants first presented the annulment mechanism in the ICSID Convention in general as already mentioned above in paragraph 67, insisting on the principle that the Committee should exercise discretion even when a ground for annulment under Article 52(1) can be identified.\n\n96.\n\nThe Claimants then analyze Article 52(1)(b) and insist on the fact that it imposes a dual requirement of an \"*excess of power*\" that is \"*manifest*\". Concerning the existence of an excess of power, the Claimants recall that the drafters of the ICSID Convention anticipated an excess of power when a tribunal went beyond the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement, decided points which had not been submitted to it or failed to apply the law agreed by the parties. They further consider that the drafters intended to draw a distinction between failure to apply the proper law and an incorrect or erroneous application of that law, a distinction reflected in the case law103. The Claimants criticize Hungary's attempt to blur this distinction between failure to apply and error in the application of the law104. Coming then to the \"*manifest*\" excess of power, the Claimants contend that the excess of power must be obvious and substantially serious as well as immediately identifiable and not only consist of a \"*wrong*\" application of law as contended by Hungary105. The Claimants also contest Hungary's contention that the \"*manifest*\" requirement would be always satisfied when a decision about jurisdiction is wrong, considering that the case law indicates in their view that no distinction is to be made between jurisdiction and other issues106. They insist on the fact that, as tribunals are judges of their own competence, *ad hoc* committees have been reluctant to annul awards on the basis of an alleged lack of jurisdiction107.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 26-30.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 31-33.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 35-37.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 40-42; Hearing Transcript, 76:16-25, 77:01-13.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 42-44.\n\n97.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants strive to demonstrate that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers by upholding jurisdiction. They insist that, because the arguments concerning the *Achmea* Decision\u00a0have already been examined by the Tribunal, a new appraisal by the *ad hoc* Committee would \"*cross the line that separates annulment from appeal*\"108. Thus for the Claimants, the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction *ratione volontatis*109 was not an excess of power, and even, *quod non*, if it would exist it could not be qualified as \"*manifest*\" since the Tribunal diligently considered the jurisdictional objections raised by Hungary in relation to the *Achmea* Decision and concluded that, even if the United Kingdom and Hungary had terminated the BIT, a conclusion which Claimants reject, the Claimants had accepted the BIT's offer to arbitrate prior to its purported termination110.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 46-51.\n\nAnd not \"*voluntaris*\"!\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 55-57.\n\n**ii. Mitigation**\n------------------\n\n98.\n\nIn their initial statement of their position respecting the Tribunal's handling of mitigation, the Claimants begin with the observation that, unlike the primary argument that the Claimants had failed to mitigate their loss, Hungary's alternative argument that damages should be reduced to take account of the \"*quasi-subletting*\" was raised for the first time in the arbitration only briefly in the rejoinder, and then again during the hearing. According to the Claimants, the legal argumentation advanced in support of Hungary's case in this annulment proceeding was not included in Hungary's submissions during the arbitration111.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 63.\n\n99.\n\nThe Claimants, having recalled that Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention does not provide for annulment on the basis of an error of fact or law, observe that Hungary's complaint about mitigation does not relate to the Tribunal's interpretation of the duty to mitigate damages but to an alleged corollary of that duty. According to the Claimants, Hungary's complaint is just that the damages payable to the Claimants should be reduced by any amount saved through the mitigation steps112. Moreover, no valuation for the subletting with all components was presented to the Tribunal by the experts, and the claim relied only on Hungary's counsel's calculation113. The Claimants emphasize that the Tribunal recognized the investor's efforts to mitigate its damages by \"*quasi-subletting*\" but contend that mitigation efforts after the date of valuation are irrelevant. They argue that Hungary does not contend that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law to its argument on mitigation114 and they contest the existence of a second component of the mitigation principle, which would exist in English law but not in international law115. The Claimants recall that anyhow a misapplication of the applicable law is not an annullable error116 and has to be distinguished from the non-application of law. They affirm that even if the Committee were to consider that the Tribunal's treatment of the \"*second component of the mitigation principle*\" was a manifest excess of power, it should exercise its discretion not to annul this part of the Award117.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 60-63.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 63-69.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 73.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 81.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 76-80.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 86-90.\n\n100.\n\nThe Claimants comment on what they describe as a \"*shift*\" in Hungary's position, stating as follows:\n\nRealizing the absurdity of conflating the alleged misapplication of a subset (\"*second component*\") of a subset (mitigation) of a subset (law of damages) of the applicable law (international law) with a \"*veritable non-application of the proper law as a whole*\", Hungary shifts the emphasis in its Reply from mitigation to the law of damages in general and reconstructs its case as an egregious error in the application of principles of international law relating to damages, including the principle of full compensation and unjust enrichment [\u2026]118.\n\nThe Claimants tell the Committee that \"[t]*he only real point of interest in Hungary's Reply is its decision to downgrade its Request for Relief in respect of the Tribunal's mitigation analysis from annulment of the entirety of the Award on quantum to a partial annulment of \u20ac375,000*\"119.\n\nRejoinder, para 15.\n\nRejoinder, para 16.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n***a. Jurisdiction***\n---------------------\n\n101.\n\nHungary contends that the Tribunal committed an excess of power because it exercised a jurisdiction it did not have in not properly addressing the issue of consent to arbitration. The Tribunal should have refused to consider Article 8 of the BIT as the basis of its jurisdiction, since the *Achmea* Decision and the 2019 Declaration by the EU Member States had confirmed that all bilateral investment treaties between EU Member States were contrary to their commitments as EU Member States. Hungary does not contest, however, that at the date of the initiation of this proceeding it had considered that Article 8 of the BIT could be relied on.\n\n102.\n\nThe notion of manifest excess of power has been generally analyzed as implying that a tribunal has manifestly stepped entirely outside the scope of its authority and manifestly disregarded the boundaries of it powers and the term \"*manifest*\" has been interpreted as \"*clear*\", \"*obvious*\", \"*self-evident*\" and also substantively serious120. This would mean here that the Tribunal went beyond its jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* or *ratione materiae*.\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE*, paras 39-40.\n\n103.\n\nDuring the arbitration proceeding, the issues of whether the *Achmea* Decision\u00a0was binding and of the value of the 2019 Declaration were discussed in detail, and the Tribunal concluded that the BIT's offer to arbitrate was standing and that a valid arbitration agreement was formed when the Claimants accepted this offer, thus creating the consent to arbitrate required under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention121. The Tribunal emphasized that, even if the State parties had actually decided to terminate the BIT, the investor would be protected pursuant to the 20-year sunset clause. And if the protection of existing investment outlives an unambiguous termination of the BIT, the protection must continue *a fortiori* in respect of a decision (i.e. the *Achmea* Decision) of an adjudicatory body constituted under a different treaty or of declarations (i.e. the 2019 Declaration) that purport to clarify the legal consequences of that Decision122. All arguments presented by the Respondent have been carefully examined and answered in the Award, which contains an interpretation of the scope of the *Achmea* Decision and of the 2019 Declaration that is consistent with that of all tribunals and committees seized on that issue. It follows that no excess of power on these different aspects of the jurisdiction issue has been demonstrated.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 248.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 223.\n\n104.\n\nThe Committee has identified no error, let alone any manifest error, in the Tribunal's decision as to why the offer to arbitrate contained in Article 8 of the BIT\u00a0was valid and capable of acceptance by the Claimants when they commenced arbitration against Hungary. In particular, this Committee does not see any excess of power by the Tribunal in its determinations that (i) as an ICSID Tribunal, it could not abandon its mandate and blindly follow the determination of another adjudicatory body such as the CJEU but to the contrary was required to perform its own analysis; (ii) the CJEU has no exclusive or ultimate jurisdiction in respect of the interpretation of the BIT or the VCLT rules on treaty conflicts; and (iii) in order to determine whether Article 8 of the BIT is precluded by the EU Treaties, it does not suffice to interpret only the EU Treaties. To the contrary, such a determination requires the interpretation of both the EU Treaties and the BIT, in order to answer questions such as whether the BIT and the EU Treaties govern the same subject matter as provided in Article 30 of the VCLT and, if so, whether there is a normative conflict between these treaties as understood under the VCLT123. The Tribunal considered that pursuant to Article 8 of the BIT and to the Convention and absent any manifestation of the contrary, there has been a valid consent of the Parties on its jurisdiction since the filing of the request. It cannot therefore be considered that the Tribunal manifestly disregarded the boundaries of its authority and it follows that as no excess of power on these different aspects of the jurisdiction *ratione voluntatis* issue has been demonstrated, the discussion whether it would be manifest has not to be opened.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 208-209.\n\n***b. Mitigation***\n-------------------\n\n105.\n\nHungary contends that the Tribunal made an egregious error constitutive of an excess of power in not taking into account, for the determination of the quantum, the profits drawn by In\u00edcia from the production of potatoes on sublet State-owned land after the expropriation. The obligation for the injured party to minimize or avoid losses is a well-established principle in international law124 as well as the principle of mitigation, which has been recognized in investment arbitration and especially in the ICSID case law:\n\n[\u2026] that general principle of international law [\u2026] requires an innocent party to act reasonably in attempting to mitigate its losses125.\n\n*Amco v. Indonesia*, paras 167-169; E. Gaillard, *La jurisprudence du CIRDI*, Pedone, 2004, p. 307; *General Electric Company, on Behalf of Its Aircraft Engine Business Group v. The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Military Industries Organization, Iran Aircraft Industries and Bank Markazi Iran*, IUSCT Case No. 386, Award, March 15, 1991, para 43, according to which the claimant *\"was not only permitted, but indeed obligated, to mitigate its damages*\".\n\n*Hrvatska Elektroprivreda D.D. v. Slovenia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/24, Award, December 17, 2015, **RL-63**, para 215.\n\n106.\n\nAs for the measures employed by the injured party, it appears in the ICSID case law that the tribunals have constantly considered that they had to appreciate *in concreto* whether such measures had been appropriate. In the present case the Tribunal deemed that the investor did comply with this obligation and this is not contested as such by the Respondent126.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 62; Award, **AF-3**, para 427.\n\n107.\n\nHowever, there is no evidence that an obligation to take into account the profits drawn from any activities undertaken by the Claimants which reduce the quantum of their losses is recognized in international law, particularly when those activities were based, as in the Claimants' case, on a quasi-sublease arrangement that, in the Tribunal's words, did \"*not provide legal security comparable to that of ownership or a lease*\"127 and whose legal basis was tenuous at best, as it emerged during the arbitration and subsequently during the Hearing of this annulment procedure. Therefore, it is difficult to consider that the Tribunal made an egregious error and thus exceeded its powers. Even if an excess of power could result from the absence of application of a rule by a tribunal, this would require that the existence of an applicable rule and its importance as for the issue would be established, which is not the case here. Therefore, the Committee considers that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers in not taking into account the value of the potatoes sale.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 417.\n\n108.\n\nHungary also contends, as explained above, that the Tribunal committed an egregious error in its alleged confusion of two distinct and separate components of damage analysis: the *ex ante* valuation of the expropriated asset and the subsequent adjustment of the amount of damages to reflect the Claimants' *ex post* mitigation of their losses. In the Committee's view, it may be argued that the cross reference by the Tribunal in paragraphs 422 and 425 of the Award, when discussing mitigation, to the principle that \"*a valuation cannot take into account facts that occurred after the valuation date*\" may lead to an incorrect understanding that the Tribunal stated - as Hungary seems to suggest - that mitigation efforts should always be irrelevant, under all circumstances, in the determination of the net loss sustained by the injured party. In the Committee's view, such an inference would be a stretch, given what the Tribunal actually wrote, which referred exclusively to *ex ante* valuations.\n\n109.\n\nHungary contended that, in this particular case, the Tribunal's misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law was so gross and egregious as to be tantamount to a failure to apply the proper law128. Although the distinction between an annulment proceeding and an appeal is invariably noted in annulment decisions, there is broad agreement that an excess of powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention may occur if a tribunal fails to apply the proper law129.\n\nReply, paras 44 to 75; Hearings transcript, 54:08-25, 55:01-25, 56:01-08.\n\nSee C. Schreuer, L. Malintoppi, A. Reinish, A. Sinclair, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*, 2d ed. 2009, **AL-10**, paras 191-270. See, e.g., *Kl\u00f6ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais*, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, May 3, 1985, **AL-33**, paras 58 to 60; *MINE v. Guinea*, para 5.03; *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa S.A. v. The Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Decision on annulment, September 5, 2007, **CL-21**, para 98.\n\n110.\n\nAlthough failure to apply the proper law may be a valid reason for annulment, it is fundamental that a mere error in the application of the proper law is not. The *ad hoc* committee in *Soufraki v. UAE* usefully explained as follows:\n\nICSID *ad hoc* committees have commonly been quite clear in their statements \u2013 if not always in the effective implementation of these statements \u2013 that a distinction must be made between the failure to apply the proper law, which can result in annulment, and an error in the application of the law, which is not a ground for annulment130.\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE*, para 85.\n\n111.\n\nIndeed, during the drafting of the ICSID Convention, a proposal was rejected that would have made \"*manifestly incorrect application of the law*\" a ground for annulment131.\n\nHistory of the ICSID Convention, Vol. II, **CL-5**, pp. 853-854.\n\n112.\n\nNotwithstanding Hungary's initial formulation in the Memorial, the objection that has been advanced in this annulment proceeding is not to the failure by the Tribunal to apply the proper law, here the international law respecting damages. Rather, Hungary's complaint is that the international law respecting damages, or more specifically that part of that international law that concerns mitigation of loss, was erroneously applied. In Hungary's submission, the Tribunal's misapplication of a portion of the properly applicable law was not merely incorrect, but egregiously incorrect. Irrespective of the claimed egregiousness of what Hungary argues to have been legal error by the Tribunal, Hungary has not, in the judgement of the Committee, advanced the sort of objection on the basis of which an excess of power within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention may be found. The Committee does not view it as necessary or appropriate in this annulment proceeding, which is not an appeal, to consider whether the Tribunal did, or did not, err in its application of the law concerning mitigation.\n\n113.\n\nThe failure to apply the proper law, as a concept, has been subject to multiple interpretations. For example, the *ad hoc* committee in *Duke Energy v. Peru* decided that what mattered for purposes of annulment was the application of the right system of law, and not the application, or failure to apply, a particular rule of law. The *Duke Energy* decision put it as follows:\n\n[\u2026] the obligation upon a tribunal under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention to apply, *inter alia*, \"*the law of the Contracting State*\" is a reference to the whole of that law, such as the Tribunal may determine to be relevant and applicable to the issue before it, and not to any particular portion of it132.\n\nIn contrast, in *Amco v. Indonesia*, the first *ad hoc* committee annulled the award because the tribunal had applied Indonesia's foreign investment law but, in the view of the committee, overlooked a provision of it133. Whether, and in what circumstances, the failure to apply some part of the properly applicable law appropriately may result in annulment has been frequently considered by *ad hoc* committees, sometimes with divergent outcomes134. In any event, although there is a question as to whether non-application of certain important rules of international law should be understood as an excess of powers for failure to apply the proper law135, Hungary's claims that the Tribunal erred in not reducing the damages awarded to reflect the value of potato production on subleased land does not present a case of that kind.\n\n*Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28, Decision on annulment, March 1, 2011, **AL-36**, para 212 (emphasis in original).\n\n*Amco v.

F ailure to S tate the R easons on which the A ward is B ased**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. Hungary's Position***\n---------------------------\n\n**i. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n114.\n\nUnder Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention Hungary recalls the two-fold duty ensuing from Article 48(3) of the Convention: the obligation for the Tribunal to address every question submitted to it, and the obligation to highlight the rationale behind those points that are essential to the Tribunal's reasoning136. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal failed to address Hungary's jurisdictional argument based on Article 351 of the TFEU137. Hungary recalls that it invoked two separate and independent conflict rules of international law to resolve the incompatibility between Article 8 of the BIT\u00a0and Articles 267\u00a0and 344\u00a0of the TFEU, namely Article 30(3) of the VCLT and Article 351 of the TFEU and, in Hungary's opinion, the Tribunal explicitly recognized these two separate basis138 but failed to take into account Article 351 of the TFEU, considering that, after finding that it was not bound by the *Achmea* Decision nor by the 2019 Declaration, the only remaining question to address was whether \"*by the time of the commencement of these proceedings, Article 8 of the BIT had been overridden as a consequence of Hungary's accession to the EU, pursuant to the conflict provisions of Article 30 of the VCLT*\"139. Without denying the applicability of Article 30(3) of the VCLT, Hungary contends that the Tribunal failed to determine whether Article 351 could apply and resolve the incompatibility, a failure that affects the jurisdiction issue and the Award as a whole, which should therefore be annulled. Hungary also avers that the requirement for the application of Article 30 of the VCLT that the successive treaties relate to the \"*same subject matter*\" does not exist under Article 351 of the TFEU and that the applicability of Article 351 should therefore be examined separately and that the Tribunal failed to address this argument of the Respondent140.\n\nMemorial, paras 182-192.\n\nHearing Transcript, 28:08-25, 29:01-25, 30:01-25, 31:01-25.\n\nMemorial, para 199.\n\nMemorial, para 201, quoting the Award, para 224.\n\nMemorial, paras 205-207; Reply paras 174-175.\n\n**ii. Qualification of the dispute**\n------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe second argument of Hungary under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention concerns the alleged failure of the Tribunal to address the investment as a whole and to consider the argument that there has been no substantial deprivation of the investment as a whole. Hungary recalls that in its closing oral submissions in the arbitration, Hungary insisted that - because the Claimants continued farming in Hungary at profit141 - their claim was not in substance an expropriation claim, but rather perhaps a claim for denial of fair and equitable treatment claim, which was not available to the Claimants under the BIT142.\n\nMemorial, paras 215-222; Hearing Transcript, 35:07-25, 36:01-25, 37:01-25, 38:01-25, 39:01-25, 40:01-25, 41:01- 25, 42:01-25, 43:01-25, 44:01-25, 45:01-25, 46:01-25, 47:01-13.\n\nMemorial, para 215.\n\n116.\n\nHungary points to paragraph 10 of the Award as establishing that the Tribunal understood its \"*investment as a whole*\" argument143. In that paragraph, the Award states that \"[t]*he Respondent also rejects having expropriated the Claimants' investment as a whole, as the Claimants still continue their farming activity in Hungary at profit*\"144. It is against this backdrop, in Hungary's submission, that the Tribunal failed to address what should have been a decisive argument in its favor145, and thereby failed to state reasons, warranting annulment of the Award pursuant to Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention146.\n\nMemorial, para 216.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 10.\n\nMemorial, para 217.\n\nMemorial, paras 222-225.\n\n**iii. Mitigation**\n-------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe third argument concerns the alleged failure of the Tribunal to state reasons with respect to mitigation. The Applicant advances the Award's totally deficient reasoning by which Hungary's mitigation argument was rejected.\n\n***b. The Claimants' Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimants recall the legal test under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention and state that the right to seek annulment only arises if the Tribunal failed to address a crucial or decisive argument147. The Claimants further contend that, even if an annullable error is found, *ad hoc* committees have discretion under Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention whether to annul the award148.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 98.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 104.\n\n**i. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimants consider that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons first on the jurisdiction issue, as the Tribunal implicitly addressed Article 351 of the TFEU. The Tribunal's determination that the issue of whether the EU Treaties overrode Article 8 of the BIT\u00a0was governed by international law explains why the analysis that followed was solely through the lens of the VCLT149 and did not diverge from the consistent line of investment awards according to which the EU Treaties and investment treaties do not bear on the same matter150. The issue of the applicability of the TFEU was also addressed by the Tribunal, considering that there is no conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and Articles 267\u00a0and 344\u00a0of the TFEU and that the applicability of Article 351 was subject to such a conflict151.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 106-108.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 109-113.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 112.\n\n**ii. Qualification of the dispute**\n------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nFor the Claimants, Hungary's argument is a \"*straw man*\", as the Claimants maintain that they made clear in their memorial that the \"*investment*\" for the purposes of the dispute was not the farm, but rather the Claimants' leasehold rights over the State-owned agricultural land. The Claimants' definition of \"*investment*\" did not include the farm, they submit152. It follows for the Claimants that the Tribunal did not have jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to decide whether the farm had been expropriated153. Thus, Hungary's argument about the absence of substantial deprivation of the investment falls short and could not have affected the outcome154.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 116-118.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 125a.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para 121.\n\n**iii. Mitigation**\n-------------------\n\n121.\n\nFinally, concerning mitigation, the Claimants state that Hungary does not contend that the Tribunal failed to provide any reasons. In the Claimants' submission, the case law establishes that a distinction is to be made between the failure to state any reasons and the failure to state sufficient reasoning or an argument that would have been decisive for the outcome of the case155.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 128-134.\n\n**(2) The Committee's Analysis**\n--------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nThe present Committee fully adheres to the statement in the *MINE v. Guinea* decision, according to which: \"[t]*he Committee is of the opinion that the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law*\"156.\n\n*Mine v. Guinea*, para 5.08.\n\n**i. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n123.\n\nHungary argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for not using the right rule to solve an alleged conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and European treaty obligations, erroneously preferring to use the rule of Article 30(3) VCLT rather than Article 351 of the TFEU. According to the Respondent, this was a crucial and decisive argument which was neglected by the Tribunal with the consequence that the requisites of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention are not met and the Award should be annulled.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal recalled that the Parties agreed that the question whether EU Treaties override the dispute resolution clause of the BIT must be assessed under international law and that the interpretation and validity of the BIT, because it is an international treaty, is governed by the VCLT, to which Hungary and the United Kingdom are parties157. The Respondent recalls that throughout the proceeding it invoked two separate and independent conflict rules of international law to resolve the incompatibility between Article 8 of the BIT\u00a0and Articles 267\u00a0and 344\u00a0of the TFEU. These are Article 30(3) of the VCLT and Article 351 of the TFEU, which were presented on the same level with distinct arguments158. The Respondent objects that the Tribunal did not address Article 351 of the TFEU to solve the conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 203.\n\nMemorial, paras 194-197.\n\n125.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal first turns to the rule of Article 30(3) of the VCLT to address the alleged conflict issue between the treaties. The Tribunal having examined whether intra-EU bilateral investment treaties and the TFEU related to the same subject matter concluded by the negative159 and explained that, in any event, it did not see any conflict between Article 8 of the BIT and Articles 267\u00a0and 344\u00a0of the TFEU160.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 228-238.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 242-247.\n\n126.\n\nThe demonstration is perfectly clear and enables the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal. After beginning with the conflict rule of Article 30(3) of the VCLT to analyze the alleged conflict between the treaties, the Tribunal was logical with the above-mentioned affirmation that the rules of general international law should be applied first. Although the Tribunal did not consider that the \"*same-subject matter*\" requirement of Article 30(3) of the VCLT had been satisfied, it nonetheless explored whether a conflict could be found between Article 8 of the BIT and Articles 267\u00a0and 344\u00a0of the TFEU. Its conclusion was that no such conflict existed. Hence, in the absence of any conflict, there was no need for the Tribunal to analyze the relevance for the case of the special conflict rule enshrined in Article 351 of the TFEU.\n\n127.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Tribunal did not fail to state the reasons on which its decision on jurisdiction was based.\n\n**ii. Qualification of the dispute**\n------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nEven if the value of the farm, with and without the lease rights, was taken into account to determine the quantum of the damages resulting from the expropriation of the lease rights, it is clear that the discussion before the Tribunal, as defined in the Claimants' claim, was bearing on the expropriation of the lease rights as a consequence of the changes of the agriculture legislation in Hungary.\n\n129.\n\nHungary is correct that the Tribunal explicitly discussed the concept of investment only when considering its own subject-matter jurisdiction and that, when doing so, it stated that \"*the existence of an investment must be assessed holistically*\"161 and that \"*the Tribunal should look at the investment as a whole*\"162.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 274.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 276.\n\n130.\n\nThe Tribunal found that the Parties disagreed as to whether, by the time of the arbitration, the Claimants continued to possess leasehold rights capable of being expropriated, and described that disagreement as a \"*legal dispute arising under Article 6*\" of the BIT, and for that reason precisely within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal163.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, paras 279-281.\n\n131.\n\nIt is also true, as argued by Hungary, that the Tribunal, after having reaffirmed its subject-matter jurisdiction, did not expressly address Hungary's argument that the 2011 Amendment did not deprive the Claimants of their investment \"*as a whole*\" and, hence, did not amount to an \"*expropriation*\" for purposes of Article 6 of the BIT164.\n\nHearing Transcript, 42:02-25, 43:01-25, 44:03-25, 45:01-04.\n\n132.\n\nThe Committee, nonetheless, shares the Claimants' view that the Tribunal consistently accepted the Claimants' assertion that the relevant \"*investment*\" for the purposes of Article 6 of the BIT\u00a0was not the farm, but rather the leasehold rights. The following are among the passages of the Award from which it is clear that the Tribunal understood the \"*investment*\" for the purposes of Article 6 of the BIT to be the pre-lease rights, rather than the farm as a whole:\n\n[\u2026] The present dispute, which concerns the alleged expropriation of the Claimants' leasehold rights [\u2026]165 (emphasis added)\n\n[\u2026] International law, and in particular the non-expropriation standard contained in Article 6 of the BIT, provides a certain degree of protection for vested rights [\u2026]166 (emphasis added)\n\n[\u2026] the lease fulfilled the same function as ownership in terms of the investor's expectation of legal certainty and stability. As a result, the pre-lease right must be deemed to benefit from the protection against uncompensated State interference167.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 273.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 347.\n\nAward, **AF-3**, para 360.\n\n133.\n\nIn the Committees' view, the Award leaves no doubt that the Tribunal decided not to accept Hungary's argument that there was no \"*expropriation*\" of an \"*investment*\" (meaning, in Hungary's submission, the farm) because the farm remained profitable even after the Claimants were deprived of the pre-lease rights, since in the Tribunal's view the relevant investment to be considered in the expropriation were the lease rights, as stated by the Claimants in their claim. It is well established that awards need not be exhaustive in expressly addressing each and every argument raised by the parties, particularly when the implicit rejection of an argument follows clearly from the stated reasoning of the award. That the Tribunal did not explicitly spell out the reasons why Hungary's \"*investment as a whole*\" argument was not accepted cannot be regarded as a serious omission, if it can be regarded as an omission at all.\n\n**iii. Mitigation**\n-------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe arguments presented by the Respondent concerning an alleged failure to state the reasons for the decision on mitigation are close to those presented under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. For the reasons already explained above, the Committee finds no deficiency in the Tribunal's determination of damages on the basis of which the Award could be annulled.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. The Parties ' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n**(1) Hungary's Costs Submissions**\n-----------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nIn requesting the *ad hoc* Committee to annul the Award in its entirety or partially and asking that the Claimants bear all costs of the proceeding, Hungary seems to endorse the rule \"*the cost follow the event*\"168. Hungary quantifies its costs in HUF 375,532,592 plus USD 349,287.20169.\n\nMemorial, para 233; Reply, para 203; Hungary's Statement of Costs, para 4.\n\nHungary's Statement of Costs, para 3.\n\n**(2) The Claimants' Costs Submissions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimants concur to the rule endorsed by Hungary that \"*costs follow the event*\" as this rule is routinely applied by *ad hoc* committees170. The Claimants quantify their costs in GBP 210,000 plus EUR 95,250171.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras 140-144; Rejoinder, paras 53-54; Email from the Claimants of July 9, 2021.\n\nClaimants' Statement of Costs, excel table.\n\n**B. The Committee ' s Decision on Costs**\n------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n138.\n\nThis provision, together with Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied by virtue of Arbitration Rule 53) gives the Committee discretion to allocate all costs of the proceeding, including attorney's fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n139.\n\nThe costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to USD:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Committee Members' fees and expenses |\n| President | 58,943.36 |\n| Manuel Conthe | 42,668.05 |\n| Michael Nolan | 37,595.46 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 84,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses172 | 6,631.29 |\n| **Total** | **229,838.16** |\n\nThis amount includes actual charges relating to the dispatch of this Decision (printing, copying and courier).\n\n140.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Applicant pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e)173.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Applicant.\n\n141.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee orders the Applicant to bear all costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses and, given that the Claimants have prevailed with respect to all the grounds for annulment advanced by Hungary, and thus are the prevailing party in this annulment proceeding, GBP 210,000 plus EUR 95,250 to cover the Claimants' legal fees and expenses, which amount the Committee regards as reasonable. Although the Committee has required the Applicant to pay the Claimants' costs, the Committee wishes to express its appreciation for the professional and useful manner in which both sides have conducted themselves in this annulment proceeding and notes that the quality of the written and oral submissions has greatly aided the Committee in its determination of the Annulment Application.\n\n**VII.
