Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nFireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company has brought a claim against the United Mexican States, alleging that Mexico has breached its obligations under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), more specifically under Article 1102 (National Treatment), Article 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), Article 1110 (Expropriation and Compensation) and Article 1405 (National Treatment) of the NAFTA, with the result that Claimant has suffered damages.\n\n2.\n\nThe United Mexican States challenges the competence of the Tribunal *ratione materiae* to hear those claims of Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company that are based on alleged violations of Articles 1102, 1105 and 1405 of the NAFTA. It contends that the measures in question are exclusively governed by Chapter Fourteen of the NAFTA relating to Financial Services. On the other hand, the United Mexican States does not object to the Tribunal\u2019s competence to hear the merits of the dispute to the extent that the alleged violation concerns Article 1110 (Expropriation and Compensation) of the NAFTA (applicable through Article 1401(2)), without prejudice to the other exceptions available under the applicable rules.\n\n3.\n\nThe present Decision rules on the challenge to its competence brought by the United Mexican States.1\n\nIn present Decision, the Tribunal uses the terms \"competence\" and \"jurisdiction\" as being equivalent legal concepts. It is to be noted that the NAFTA refers to \"jurisdiction\" (see, e.g., Article 1126(2)); 1126(8)) and the\\*Additional Facility Rules to \"competence\" (Article 46)\n\n**II. The Parties**\n-------------------\n\n4.\n\nClaimant :\n\nFireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Company 777 San Marin Drive Novato, CA 94998 United States of America\n\nhereinafter: \"Fireman\u2019s Fund\" or \"Claimant.\"\n\n5.\n\nFireman\u2019s Fund is incorporated under the laws of the Sate of California. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz of America, Inc., a Delaware corporation that is in turn wholly-owned by Allianz AG of Munich, Germany. It is a sister corporation to Allianz M\u00e9xico. It has as its principal business the provision of various types of insurance, including accident and fire insurance.\n\n6.\n\nIn these proceedings, Fireman\u2019s Fund was initially represented by Mr. Lawrence W. Newman and Mr. Raymundo E. Enriquez of the law firm Baker & McKenzie and from 9 August 2002, by Mr. Daniel M. Price of the law firm Sidley, Austin, Brown & Wood LLP, and Mr. Raymundo E. Enriquez of the law firm Baker & McKenzie.\n\n7.\n\nRespondent:\n\nThe United Mexican States General Directorate of Foreign Investments Ministry of Commerce and Industrial Development Mexico, DF, Mexico\n\nhereinafter: \"Mexico\" or \"Respondent.\"\n\n8.\n\nIn these proceedings, the Government of Mexico is represented by Mr. Hugo Perezcano Diaz, Director General de Consultor\u00eda Jur\u00eddica de Negociaciones, Secretar\u00eda de Econom\u00eda.\n\n**III. Procedural History**\n---------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 30 October 2001, Fireman\u2019s Fund submitted a Notice of Arbitration against Mexico pursuant to the provisions of Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA and requested that the claims set forth therein be submitted to arbitration trader the Additional Facility Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\").\n\n10.\n\nIn the Notice of Arbitration, Fireman\u2019s Fund alleges violations by Mexico of Article 1102,1105, 1110 and 1405 of the NAFTA and seeks, with respect to each of its claims under those Articles, \"an award of damages in its favor, and against Mexico of US$50,000,000, together with applicable interest, its attorneys\u2019 fees and the costs incurred by it in this proceeding, together with such further and additional relief as the Arbitral Tribunal may deem appropriate.\" (Notice, \u00b6 40).\n\n11.\n\nFireman\u2019s Fund supplemented its Notice of Arbitration by two letters dated 27 November 2001 and 11 January 2002.\n\n12.\n\nMexico submitted a letter dated 11 December 2001 in which it raised concerns about the applicability of Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA in the present case.\n\n13.\n\nOn 15 January 2002, the Secretary-General of lCSID informed the Parties that Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s application for access to the Additional Facility was approved and issued on the same day a Certificate of Registration of the Notice.\n\n14.\n\nOn 17 May 2002, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted. The Tribunal is composed of Professor Albert Jan van den Berg (appointed as President of the Tribunal by the Secretary-General of ICSID), of Dutch nationality, residing at Tervuren, Belgium, Professor Andreas F. Lowenfeld (appointed by Claimant), of US nationality, residing at New York, New York, and Mr. Francisco Carrillo Gamboa (appointed by Respondent), of Mexican nationality, residing at Mexico, D.F., Mexico. Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson of lCSID was designated to serve as Secretary to the Tribunal. All subsequent written communications between the Tribunal and the Parties were made through the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n15.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held, with the Parties\u2019 agreement, in Washington, D.C., on 22 July 2002. The Summary of the First Session is deemed incorporated into this Decision.\n\n16.\n\nAt the first session it was agreed by the Parties that the proceedings in the present case are divided into three phases. The first phase would concern the Preliminary Question, the second phase would concern the merits of the case only as to liability, and the third phase, if necessary, would concern the quantification of damages.\n\n17.\n\nAs to the first phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal decided to establish a written and oral phase regarding Respondent\u2019s objection to competence and scheduled the proceedings pursuant to an agreement of the Parties.\n\n18.\n\nBy letters dated 29 July 2002, Claimant and Respondent informed the Tribunal that they had agreed on Toronto, Canada, as the place of arbitration for the purposes of Article 1130 of the NAFTA.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter of 9 August 2002, Claimant informed the Tribunal that the New York office of Baker & McKenzie was substituted by the Washington office of Sidley Austin Brown & Wood LLP, whereas the Mexico office of Baker & McKenzie was to continue its representation of Claimant. In light thereof, Claimant requested an extension of the dates agreed upon at the first session of the Tribunal for the submission by Claimant and Respondent of their pleadings relating to the first phase of the proceedings. By letter dated 13 August 2002, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it did not oppose Claimant\u2019s request. Accordingly, the request was allowed and a new schedule was fixed according to Claimant\u2019s proposal.\n\n20.\n\nOn 22 August 2002, Claimant submitted a Request for Production of Documents. On 23 August 2002, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it did not require the production of any documents at this stage of the proceedings, but that it reserved its right to submit such a request at a later stage of the proceedings.\n\n21.\n\nRespondent filed objections to Claimant\u2019s Request for Production of Documents on 4 September 2002. Claimant replied on 9 September 2002. Respondent filed a rejoinder on 18 September 2002. By Procedural Order No. 1 of 19 September 2002, the Tribunal denied Claimant\u2019s Request for lack of specificity at this stage of the proceedings and failure to show whether, and if so to what extent, its Request comes within the purview of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, including \"the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusions.\" The Tribunal allowed Claimant to renew its request within 15 days after the filing of Respondent\u2019s Memorial on the Preliminary Question.\n\n22.\n\nOn 22 October 2002, Respondent filed its Memorial on the Preliminary Question with exhibits.\n\n23.\n\nOn 4 November 2002, Claimant submitted a Renewed Request for production of documents. Respondent filed its objections to the Renewed Request on 12 November 2002, Claimant replied on 14 November 2002 and, at the request of the Arbitral Tribunal, Respondent filed a rejoinder to Claimant\u2019s reply on 20 November 2002. On 22 November 2002, the Tribunal granted Claimant\u2019s Renewed Request, without prejudice as to whether the documents disclosed to Claimant would be admissible in the plenary proceedings. Respondent was requested to produce the requested documents no later than 3 December 2002.\n\n24.\n\nOn 20 December 2002, Claimant filed its Memorial on the Preliminary Question with exhibits, including an opinion by Mr. Fernando Borja Mujica, and affidavits by Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda and Dr. Gehart E. Reuss.\n\n25.\n\nBy letters dated 9 January 2003, Mr. K. Thompson, Counsel for the Government of Canada and Mr. David A. Pawlak, Attorney-Adviser for the Government of the United States of America informed the Tribunal that their respective Governments did not intend to file a NAFTA Article 1128 submission on the issue of competence. Mr. David A. Pawlak indicated further that, in accordance with the schedule adopted at the first session of the Tribunal, his Government might avail itself of the opportunity to make such a submission on 27 February 2003.\n\n26.\n\nOn 14 January 2003, Respondent requested the submission of a Reply and Rejoinder on the Preliminary Question and the postponement of the Hearing scheduled to take place on 6-7 February 2003. By letter dated 15 January 2003 Claimant objected to the Request, by letter dated 16 January 2003 Respondent replied, and by letter of 17 January 2003 Claimant reaffirmed its objections to the Request. On 23 January 2003, the Tribunal rejected Respondent\u2019s Request on the ground that it had not sufficiently substantiated the need for a Reply and a Rejoinder. The Tribunal further determined that it would safeguard both Parties\u2019 right to fully present their contentions.\n\n27.\n\nThe Parties and the President of the Tribunal held a telephone conference on 30 January 2003 concerning the organizational aspects of the Hearing (summarized in the letter dated 30 January 2003 from the Secretary of the Tribunal, which is deemed to be incorporated into this Decision).\n\n28.\n\nDuring the telephone conference, ICSID received a letter dated 29 January 2003 from Respondent submitting a \"dictamen\" by the Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito P\u00fablico (\"SHCP\") and signed by Mr. Luis Mancera de Arrigunaga. The President ordered the dictamen to be forwarded to the Claimant but not to the Tribunal members pending resolution of its admissibility into the record. At the telephone conference, Claimant voiced its concerns about the submission by Respondent. The Parties agreed that if the dictamen were admitted by the Tribunal, Claimant would be granted the opportunity to (1) cross examine the author of Respondent\u2019s submission at the Hearing, (2) conduct direct examination of Claimant\u2019s own witnesses at the Hearing to elicit views on Respondent\u2019s submission, and (3) file supplemental written affidavits or opinions in response to the submission by the close of business Tuesday 4 February 2003. By letter dated 31 January 2003, Claimant maintained its concerns and requested that the Tribunal decide whether the submission was appropriate. On the same day, the Tribunal ruled:\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the submission of the opinion issued by the Secretaria de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico as proposed by the Respondent in its letter of 29 January 2003 is not contemplated by the procedural order adopted in the present case. The Tribunal also notes that it has rejected Respondent's request to file a reply to Claimant's Counter Memorial, but that at the same time it has confirmed that it will safeguard both parties' right to fully present their case. The Tribunal further notes that the parties have agreed on certain modalities if the Tribunal were to accept the submission and that the Claimant states that the agreed modalities mitigate the reservations expressed by Claimant with respect to the filing.\n\nUnder those circumstances, having also regard to the present record regarding the jurisdictional issue and the interest of expeditious proceedings, the Tribunal declares the submission admissible, subject to the agreed modalities.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to make it clear, however, that it will not tolerate further submissions from either party that are not called for, save for exceptional circumstances.\n\n29.\n\nOn 6 and 7 February 2003, the Hearing on the Preliminary Question took place in at the offices of lCSID, Washington D.C. For Claimant appeared: Mr. Daniel M. Price, Mr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, and Judge Stephen M. Schwebel (all from Sidley, Austin, Brown & Wood, LLP), as well as Mr. Raymundo E. Enriquez (Baker & McKenzie). For Respondent appeared: Mr. Hugo Perezcano Diaz (Director General de Consultor\u00eda Jur\u00eddica de Negociaciones), Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, QC, Mr. J. Cameron Mowatt (Thomas & Partners) and Mr. Stephan E. Becker (P.C. Shaw Pittmann, LLP).\n\n30.\n\nAfter the Opening Statements, the Tribunal put forward a number of questions to the Parties to be addressed during the examination of the witnesses and/or Closing Statements (TR pp. 76-83). In the course of the Hearing, the Tribunal asked further questions (TR pp. 413-416). To the extent that the Parties and/or their witnesses addressed the above questions and to the extent that they are relevant, they will be considered below.\n\n31.\n\nThe following witnesses were examined at the Hearing:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Luis Mancera de Arrigunaga (called by Respondent)\n\n\u2022 Mr. Fernando Borja Mujica (called by Claimant)\n\n\u2022 Mr. Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda (called by Claimant)\n\n32.\n\nWith the consent of Respondent, Claimant waived calling Dr. Gehart E. Reuss who had made a witness statement for Claimant.\n\n33.\n\nThe Government of Canada was represented at the Hearing by Mr. Kevin S. Thompson, Counsel, Trade Law Bureau of the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the Department of Justice, and Mr. Dean Como of the Department of Finance. The Government of the United States of America was represented at the Hearing by Mr. David A. Pawlak, US Department of State, Office of the Legal Adviser.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter dated 13 February 2003, the Tribunal submitted to the Parties a question concerning Article 1416(7)(a) of the NAFTA. Each Party submitted a response to the above question on 24 February 2003.\n\n35.\n\nOn 27 February 2003, the Government of Canada filed a First Submission Pursuant to Article 1128 of the NAFTA. The Government of Canada took the position that the determination of whether an entity is \"authorized to do business and regulated or supervised as a financial institution\" for the purposes of Chapter Fourteen should reflect the fact that it is for the NAFTA Parties, through their respective regulatory and supervisory frameworks, to define the types of entities, and hence the scope of activities, that fall within Chapter Fourteen.\n\n36.\n\nAlso on 27 February 2003, the Government of the United States of America filed a Submission pursuant to Article 1128 of the NAFTA. The Submission by the Government of the United States of America responds to the Tribunal\u2019s question on whether a bank holding company under United States law should be considered a \"financial institution\" within the meaning of Article 1416. It stated that under United States law (i.e., the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956), United States bank holding companies meet all aspects of the definition of a \"financial institution\" in Article 1406 of the NAFTA. It also submitted that holding companies under the laws of other Parties may differ from bank holding companies under United States law, as may be the case with respect to the laws that apply to such companies.\n\n37.\n\nThe date set for rendering the present Decision was extended by the Arbitral Tribunal several times.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal deliberated at various occasions.\n\n**IV. Background**\n------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Tribunal gives the background below in the context of its decision on the Preliminary Question only. With respect to factual findings, they are based on the facts as presented by Claimant and Respondent in their written and oral submissions in the present phase of the arbitration to the extent that they are relevant to the Preliminary Question. The Tribunal\u2019s factual findings are without prejudice to its factual findings on the merits of this case.\n\n40.\n\nAt the outset it is useful to give a brief overview of the relevant competent authorities in Mexico.\n\n41.\n\nOne of the principal laws governing the financial sector in Mexico is the Ley de Instituciones de Cr\u00e9dito (\"Lic,\" Act of Credit Institutions, also called the Banking Act), which applies to the general operation of banks.\n\n42.\n\n*Banco de M\u00e9xico* is the central bank of the country and is an independent legal person of public law. Its primary objective is to maintain the stability of the national currency and, additionally, to promote the proper development of the financial system and to foster the proper functioning of the payment system.\n\n43.\n\nThe *Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores* (\"CNBV\" or \"Commission,\" formerly Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria) is authorized to supervise and regulate financial entities in order to provide for their stability and proper functioning as well as to maintain and promote the proper and balanced development of the financial system and, in connection therewith, the protection of the public interest.\n\n44.\n\nThe *Secretaria de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico* (\"SHCP,\" Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit) is a division of the federal executive power, whose principal function is to define the policies of federal Government in matters of tax, public spending, financing, creditworthiness, banking, money, currency and pricing, and tariffs for goods and services of the public sector.\n\n45.\n\nFinancial holding companies (\"sociedades controladoras de grupos financieros\") are subject to the supervision of the commission determined by the SHCP (Article 30 of the Ley para Regular las Agrupaciones Financieras of 1990, \"LRAF\"). In the present case, the SHCP determined that commission to be the CNBV. The latter has wide powers of inspection and supervision *(see* in particular Articles 1, 6, 7, 11, 12, 17, 20, 23, 26 and 30 of the LRAF, and the Ley de la Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores of 1995, \"Ley de la CNBV,\" in particular Articles 2, 3(IV), and 4). The LRAF is elaborated in various successive Circulares: No. 1158 of 1992, No. 1384 of 1997 and No. 1456 of 1999. They are also governed by the LRAF\u2019s implementing Regulations (Reglas Generales para la Constituci\u00f3n y Funcionamiento de Grupos Financieros of 1991, \"Regulations\").\n\n46.\n\nUnder the particular corporate model specified in the LRAF, an essentially passive financial holding company acquires and holds controlling interests in at least two or three financial institutions of different types. The financial holding company device thus organizes financial institutions into semi-integrated \"financial groups\" with a shared brand identity.\n\n47.\n\nThe authorized activities of a financial holding company are limited. By law, it may only (i) hold shares of financial institutions belonging to the group, (ii) enter into a guarantee arrangement (Convenio) to permit indirect pooling of assets among the financial institutions it owns, (iii) issue subordinated debentures convertible into shares representing capital, and (iv) engage in a limited range of investment and borrowing activities on its behalf *(see* LRAF, Articles 16, 23 and 28).\n\n48.\n\nFurthermore, Article 16 of the LRAF explicitly provides that a financial holding company may not engage in the financial services activities undertaken by the financial institutions that it owns. Likewise, the implementing Regulations provide that a financial holding company may not be involved in any way in the management of the operations of their financial institutions enterprises (Regulations, Title III, Section 10(8)). Similarly, Article 8 of the LRAF provides that the financial institution subsidiaries may not base any of their operations in the offices of their parent financial holding company.\n\n49.\n\nAs regards the facts, on 29 October 1992 the SHCP gave, in accordance with Article 6 of the LRAF, the authorization for the formation and functioning of Grupo Financiero BanCrecer, S.A. de C.V., a Mexican corporation (hereinafter: \"GF BanCrecer\"):\n\nARTICULO PRIMERO.- En uso de la facultad que el art\u00edculo 6o. de la Ley para Regular las Agrupaciones Financieras confiere a la Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y the Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico, se otorga autorizaci\u00f3n a Grupo Financiero Bancrecer, S.A. de C.V., para constituirse y funcionar como grupo financiero.\n\n(\u2026)\n\nARTICULO TERCERO.- La sociedad controladora tendr\u00e1 por objeto adquirir y administrar acciones emitidas por los integrantes del grupo financiero.\n\n(\u2026)\n\nARTICULO OCTAVO.- La sociedad controladora estar\u00e1 sujeta a la inspecci\u00f3n y vigilancia de la Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria.\n\n-----\n\nARTICLE FIRST.- In use of the powers granted to the Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico pursuant to article 6th of Ley para Regular las Agrupaciones Financieras, Grupo Financiero Bancrecer, S.A. de C.V., is hereby authorized to be incorporated and to operate as a financial group.\n\n(\u2026)\n\nARTICLE THIRD.- The holding company shall have the corporate purpose of acquiring and administrating those shares issued by the entities that constitute the financial group.\n\n(\u2026)\n\nARTICLE EIGHTH.- The holding company shall be subject to the inspection and supervision of the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria.\n\n50.\n\nGF BanCrecer is the holding company of BanCrecer, S.A. (hereinafter: \"Banco BanCrecer\").\n\n51.\n\nIn September 1995, Fireman\u2019s Fund purchased US$ 50 million in dollar-denominated mandatorily convertible five year subordinated debentures issued by GF BanCrecer.\n\n52.\n\nAlso in September 1995, GF BanCrecer issued similar debentures denominated in Mexican pesbs, the value of which was equivalent to US $ 50 million at the time. According to Claimant, all the pesos-denominated debentures were sold to Mexican investors.\n\n53.\n\nThe issue of the two series of debentures by GF BanCrecer in 1995 was authorized by Banco de M\u00e9xico subject to a number of limitations and conditions, including those contemplated by Article 23 of the LRAF and Article 64 of the LIC *(see* authorization granted by Banco de M\u00e9xico, 15 September 1995, Exh. R-0050-0055).\n\n54.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis in Mexico, in 1997, Banco BanCrecer encountered financial difficulties. A working group was formed to address the circumstances of Banco BanCrecer, consisting of the CNBV, the SHPC, the Banco de M\u00e9xico and the Fondo Bancario de Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro (\"FOBAPROA,\" Fund for the Protection of Bank Savings). The working group developed a Program of Rescue and Recapitalization for GF BanCrecer. Part of the Program developed by the working group was that Fireman\u2019s Funds\u2019s US$ 50 million dollar-denominated debentures would be redeemed and Fireman\u2019s Fund would, *inter alia,* invest the US$ 50 million from the debentures in the restructured Banco BanCrecer under certain conditions. Fireman\u2019s Fund participated in that part of the Program.\n\n55.\n\nAccording to Claimant, simultaneously, and without its knowledge, an alternative plan was developed to pay the holders of the peso-denominated debentures the full cash value of their debentures through a trust established by Banco BanCrecer. Claimant alleges that that repurchase was permitted and financially supported by the Mexican Government.\n\n56.\n\nClaimant contends that it obtained knowledge of the alternative plan in April 1998 only but that its request for equal treatment was denied by the President of the Commission (CNBV). The latter further denied a formal request of Claimant to that effect in April 1999.\n\n57.\n\nIn January 1999, the Instituto para la Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro Bancario (\"ipab\" Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings) took over FOBAPROA\u2019s responsibilities.\n\n58.\n\nOn 7 July 1999, Claimant requested GF BanCrecer to seek permission from Banco de M\u00e9xico for it to acquire the dollar-denominated debentures on the same terms as the peso-denominated debentures had been acquired. GF BanCrecer forwarded the request to Banco de M\u00e9xico. On 16 August 1999, Banco de M\u00e9xico denied GF BanCrecer\u2019s request.\n\n59.\n\nOn November 3, 1999, two shareholders\u2019 meetings of GF BanCrecer resolved that (1) IPAB would take control of Banco BanCrecer, (2) Banco BanCrecer would cease to be a subsidiary of GF BanCrecer, and (3) GF BanCrecer would be dissolved and liquidated.\n\n60.\n\nClaimant submitted to the Direcci\u00f3n General de Inversiones Extranjeras -Secretar\u00eda de Comercio y Fomento Industrial an amended Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration dated 29 November 2000 (replacing an earlier Notice dated 15 November 1999). The negotiations for a settlement of the dispute did not yield a result. On 30 October 2001, Claimant filed a Notice of Arbitration against Respondent with lCSID.\n\n**V. CONSIDERATION BY THE TRIBUNAL**\n------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered all written and oral submissions of the Parties and the written and oral evidence produced by them as well as the submissions of the Government of Canada and the Government of the United States of America in the present phase of the proceedings. To the extent that they are relevant to the issues concerning the Preliminary Question, they are expressly or implicitly addressed below.\n\n62.\n\nIn addressing the issues below, the Tribunal will adhere to the principle set forth Article 1131 of the NAFTA according to which \"A Tribunal established under this Section shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable rules of international law.\"\n\n63.\n\nWhen interpreting the NAFTA, the Tribunal will follow the rules of interpretation set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969. Accordingly, the text of the NAFTA is in the first place to be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Recourse can be had to supplementary rules of interpretation under the conditions stated in Article 32 of the Convention.\n\n64.\n\nClaimant submits that, as a general policy consideration, direct investor recourse to arbitration has become the rule in modem investment agreements, although there may be exceptions, and that the value of investor-state arbitral mechanism is so substantial that it should only be foreclosed when that result is unmistakably required by treaty provision. Whilst it is correct that there are more than 1,400 (some say more than 2,000) Bilateral Investment Treaties which contemplate investor-state arbitration (albeit under differing conditions) and that the value of investor-state arbitral mechanism is substantial, the Tribunal does not believe that under contemporary international law a foreign investor is entitled to the benefit of the doubt with respect to the existence and scope of an arbitration agreement.\n\n65.\n\nThe present dispute is one of the growing number of investor-state arbitrations under the NAFTA. The previous cases, so far as the Tribunal is aware, have all been brought under Chapter Eleven, the principal chapter of the NAFTA devoted to Investment. In the present case, the claim involves alleged default of some US$ 50,000,000 worth of a debt security (convertible debentures) issued by a Mexican financial holding company, and the claim arguably belongs under Chapter Fourteen, a special chapter of the NAFTA devoted to Financial Services. As examined hereafter, Claimant contends that all of its claims are to be considered under Chapter Eleven, because the conditions for application of Chapter Fourteen are not met; Respondent contends that Chapter Fourteen is applicable, because the investment in question fits the definitions of that Chapter. In moving to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction all but one of the claims presented, Respondent points to Article 1101 (3) of the NAFTA, which provides:\n\nThis Chapter does not apply to measures adopted or maintained by a Party to the extent that they are covered by Chapter Fourteen (Financial Services).\n\n66.\n\nSeveral provisions of Chapter Eleven are incorporated into Chapter Fourteen, including, as here relevant, Article 1110 concerning Expropriation and Compensation, and Articles 1115-1138 concerning the procedural aspects of dispute resolution by a tribunal such as the present one. Article 1102 on National Treatment and Article 1105 on Minimum Standard of Treatment are not incorporated into Chapter Fourteen. Accordingly, if the measures alleged to have been taken on behalf of the Government of Mexico are covered by Chapter Fourteen, this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction of the claims under Articles 1102 and 1105. Chapter Fourteen contains no counterpart to the Minimum Standard of Treatment provision of Chapter Eleven; it does contain, in Article 1405, a counterpart to the national treatment provision in Chapter Eleven, and indeed a claim for breach of Article 1405 is made in the present arbitration. However, Article 1405 is not included among the provisions to which the procedural provisions of Chapter Eleven apply (Articles 1115-1138), and Article 1414 makes clear that claims under Article 1405 are subject to state-to-state dispute settlement pursuant to Chapter Twenty, not to investor-state dispute settlement under Chapter Eleven.\n\n67.\n\nIn sum, if the measures challenged in this arbitration are covered by Chapter Fourteen, the claims brought under Articles 1102, 1105, and 1405 must be dismissed, and only the claim for expropriation pursuant to Article 1110 remains to be decided by this Tribunal. If, on the other hand, the conditions for application of Chapter Fourteen are not met, the claims under Article 1102 (National Treatment) and Article 1105 (Minimum Standards of Treatment) remain before this Tribunal, along with the expropriation claim under Article 1110.\n\n**B. Background: NAFTA and Financial Services**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThough the title of the Agreement among Canada, Mexico and the United States of America speaks of \"free trade,\" it was understood from the outset of the negotiations that transborder investment would be an important component of any plan to link the economies of the three state Parties. Furthermore, the trade to be liberalized, would not be limited to goods, but would apply, with somewhat different rules, to services as well.\n\n69.\n\nThe objectives of the NAFTA, set out in Article 102, include:\n\n(a) [to] eliminate barriers to trade in, and facilitate the crossborder movement of, goods and services between the territories of the Parties;\n\n(c) [to] increase substantially investment opportunities in the territories of the Parties.\n\n70.\n\nA particular concern of the architects of the NAFTA was the field of financial services. On the one hand, the Parties were anxious to open up the transborder exchange of financial services, particularly with Mexico, and to integrate Mexico more fully into the international financial system; on the other hand, the architects of the NAFTA understood that the principles of open access and national treatment were not suitable in all respects for the financial sector, which is subject to regulation on prudential and macroeconomic grounds by each of the state Parties. Accordingly, the negotiators of the NAFTA from the beginning contemplated a separate chapter on financial services, and for the most part the negotiations of what became Chapter Fourteen were carried on by separate teams drawn from the Finance/Treasury ministries rather than from the trade and commerce ministries of the respective governments.\n\n71.\n\nThe result is that Chapter Fourteen \"applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to (a) financial institutions of another Party; (b) investors of another Party, and investments of such investors, in financial institutions in the Party\u2019s territory; and (c) cross-border trade in financial services\" (Article 1401(1)), and that the structure of the NAFTA is such that Chapter Fourteen does not simply refer to Chapter Eleven, but rather incorporates certain of its provisions (Article 1401(2)). Chapter Fourteen has its own Annexes, including Annex VII which establishes exceptions and commitments towards liberalization. It is also to be noted that Chapter Eleven contains an underride clause in Article 1112(1) according to which in the event of any inconsistency between Chapter Eleven and any other Chapter, the other Chapter shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.\n\n72.\n\nIn regard to dispute settlement, the drafters of Chapter Fourteen drew on the two provisions for dispute settlement contained in the NAFTA. Disputes concerning prudential regulations, including allegations of violation of national treatment, were committed to state-to-state dispute settlement pursuant to Chapter Twenty; disputes about alleged expropriation as well as denials of transfers of payments and certain other prohibitions (Articles 1109 - 1111 and 1113 - 1114) were committed to investor-state dispute settlement pursuant to Chapter Eleven.\n\n73.\n\nHere again, the provisions relating the investor-state dispute settlement (Article 1115 - 1138) are \"incorporated into and made a part of this Chapter [Fourteen] *solely* for breaches by a Party of Articles 1109 through 1111, 1113 and 1114, as incorporated into this Chapter.\" (Article 1401(2), italics supplied).\n\n74.\n\nThe overall principles of the NAFTA are maintained in Chapter Fourteen, including the principle that an investor of one state Party should be permitted to establish a financial institution in the territory of another state Party (Article 1403(1)), and the principle that each state Party is to accord national treatment to investors of another Party (Article 1405). But only an investor engaged in financial services in its home country is entitled to establish a financial institution in the territory of another state Party (Article 1403(5)), and each of the three state Parties adopted significant reservations to Chapter Fourteen, reflecting differences in legislation and regulations in force at the time the NAFTA was negotiated, as well as different distribution of regulatory authority between the national governments and the respective state or provincial governments. Moreover, the reservations permitted to be taken by Mexico reflected Mexico\u2019s insistence that its financial sector not be overwhelmed by the major banks and other financial institutions based in the United States of America.\n\n75.\n\nEach country\u2019s reservations to Chapter Fourteen are contained in separate schedules set out in Annex VII, as provided in Article 1409 of the principal text. Article 2201 of the NAFTA confirms that the Annexes constitute an integral part of the Agreement, and in the view of the Tribunal, the definitions and classifications there set out are useful in construing the provisions of the Agreement.\n\n**C. Is a sociedad controladora a financial institution?**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nClaimant takes the position that Chapter Fourteen is not applicable, because Article 1401 limits the scope of the chapter (so far as here relevant) to measures relating to investors of another Party, and investments of such investors, in *financial institutions* in the Party's territory (italics supplied). Article 1416 of the NAFTA defines Financial Institutions as: any financial intermediary or other enterprise that is [i] authorized to do business and [ii] regulated or supervised as a financial institution under the law of the Party in whose territory it is located.\n\n77.\n\nThe convertible debentures in question in the present case were issued by GF BanCrecer, which, as is not disputed, was a financial holding company or \"sociedad controladora.\" Claimant asserts that a sociedad controladora does not meet the definition of financial institution, because under the law applicable to financial groups (Ley para Regular las Agrupaciones Financieras, herein LRAF) it is not \"authorized to do business,\" and because it is not regulated as a financial institution. Claimant points, *inter alia,* to Article 16 of the LRAF, which expressly prohibits financial holding companies from carrying on operations for which its financial subsidiaries are qualified, such as taking deposits if the subsidiary is a bank, or issuing insurance policies if the subsidiary is an insurance company.\n\n78.\n\nRespondent for its part asserts that a financial holding company such as GF BanCrecer is subject to approval and licensing by the Banco de Mexico, the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (Secretaria de Hacienda y Credito Publico, herein SHCP) and the National Banking and Securities Commission (Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores, herein CNBV), and thus easily passes the second test. Further, while acknowledging that the LRAF distinguishes between holding companies such as GF BanCrecer and banks or insurance companies authorized to engage in transactions directly with the public, Respondent contends that what financial holding companies are authorized to do constitutes doing business as a financial institution within the meaning of the definition of financial institution in Article 1416.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal has approached the question of whether GF BanCrecer is a financial institution within the meaning of Article 1416 of the NAFTA from the three points of view.\n\n80.\n\n*First,* the Tribunal notes that the definition of \"financial institution\" in Article 1416 is circular, except that it leaves the dispositive classification up to each State in which the enterprise in question is located. However, the Tribunal observes that the NAFTA contains chapters addressed to several distinct sectors, including energy, agriculture, telecommunications, intellectual property, and financial services. It would be strange indeed to conclude that a financial holding company such as GF BanCrecer, devoted to investing in banks and insurance companies, does not belong to the financial services sector. If it is an institution or entity, then surely GF BanCrecer must be a financial institution. Again, since it is not contested that GF BanCrecer was regulated and licensed by one or more financial regulatory agencies of the Government of Mexico, and since the task of those agencies is to regulate financial institutions, under any interpretation based on \"plain meaning\" GF BanCrecer could not fall into any category other than that of \"financial institution.\"\n\n81.\n\nClaimant stresses that in order to qualify as a financial institution under Article 1416, the entity in question should be authorized to do business as a financial institution. Claimant interprets this as meaning being able to render financial services to the public. That is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, too narrow a construction of the definition of financial institution given in Article 1416 which does not contain the language suggested by Claimant. Rather, under Mexican law, a specifically authorized financial holding company must have a majority holding in banks, insurance companies and other financial service providers. That is its very purpose and in that sense it is authorized to do business as a financial institution.\n\n82.\n\nIt should further be noted that Chapter Fourteen is not only focused on intermediaries. It also includes the organizations referred to in Article 7 LRAF, which is in itself not all inclusive (see also Ley de la CNBV). Furthermore, it is common ground between Claimant and Respondent that Mexican law does not define specifically the term financial institution. Here, notwithstanding Claimant\u2019s arguments to the contrary, it appears that financial institutions are the same as financial entities. Each financial entity is subject to regulations that are different and the requirements differ depending on what type of financial entity is involved. Common denominators are that all of them work within the framework of the financial regulations and that there is an authorization to do business. Sociedades controladoras appear to meet those common denominators. The legislation to implement Mexico\u2019s financial services undertakings under the NAFTA does not lead to a different conclusion.\n\n83.\n\n*Second,* looked at from the design of the NAFTA, it is evident that the drafters carved out the financial sector from significant portions of the general provisions, because none of the state Parties was prepared to engage in the kind of harmonization and deregulation that would have been necessary to treat banks, insurance companies, and securities firms (as well as other participants in the financial sector) in the same way as, say, the soft drink, retail trade, or shoe manufacturing industries. As noted above, Chapter Fourteen and the Annexes applicable to that Chapter contain significant differences from the general provisions on national treatment, omit a provision on \"fair and equitable treatment,\" and limit resort to investor-state arbitration. All of these differences, it is clear, are designed to leave room for national decision-making rather than harmonization, and to limit the opportunity of investors from another state Party to resort to international dispute settlement to challenge regulatory measures taken by the respective national authorities.\n\n84.\n\nAs regards Mexico, financial holding companies were expressly provided for in the LRAF, adopted prior to conclusion of the NAFTA, and were expressly provided for in the Annex to the Agreement (see below). If the Parties had intended to exclude investment in financial holding companies from the scope of Chapter Fourteen, one would have expected them to do so explicitly. No such exclusion appears either in Chapter Fourteen itself or in the corresponding Annex; in contrast, when they wanted to make other protections of the NAFTA available to investors of another Party in the financial sector, the drafters did so directly, for instance by providing that Article 1110 (as well as several other provisions of Chapter Eleven) are incorporated into Chapter Fourteen.\n\n85.\n\nThe result, as the Tribunal understands it, is that complaints by investors of another Party in the financial sector concerning regulations imposed by agencies of the host country are governed by Chapter Fourteen, and may be raised by the foreign investor only if supported by the investor's home state. If, on the other hand, a foreign investor in a financial institution claims expropriation, the standards and procedures of Chapter Eleven would be available, as they are in the present case.2 There is no indication that financial holding companies were intended to be left out of this scheme, and to be lumped instead with investments in non-financial sectors.\n\nTo avoid any possible misunderstanding, the Tribunal states that nothing in this Decision is intended to construe the scope of Article 1110 and the possible distinction under that article between a compensable taking and a non-compensable regulatory measure\n\n86.\n\n*Third,* the definitions and classifications set out in the Schedule of Mexico to Annex VII do not support Claimant\u2019s case. Following the outline of Annex VII applicable to all three state Parties, Section A defines the Sector as \"Financial Services,\" and sets out a series of reservations to Article 1403 (Establishment of Financial Institutions) and Article 1405 (National Treatment), linked to particular laws or regulations. The first reservation, linked to Article 18 of the LRAF as well as to Articles 11 and 15 of the LIC (Ley de Instituciones de Cr\u00e9dito) concerns two Sub-Sectors - Holding Companies (Sociedades Controladoras) and Commercial Banks (Instituciones de Banca M\u00faltiple). In particular, Section A of Annex VII limits aggregate foreign investment in holding companies (as well as in commercial banks) to 30 percent of common stock capital, subject to further qualification in Sections B and C. Several of the other reservations set out in Section A are applicable only to financial institutions in other Sub-Sectors, but one additional reservation is applicable to holding companies as well as to all the other Sub-Sectors - the prohibition of investment by foreign governments and foreign state enterprises, which but for the reservation would come within the definition of \"investor of a Party\" in Article 1416.\n\n87.\n\nIn respect of both of these reservations, the Schedule recognizes Holding Companies as distinct in certain aspects from other Sub-Sectors - for instance Industry Classification is not applicable. But there is no doubt that the reservations set out in Section A are expressly made applicable to foreign investors in holding companies, and that these reservations are directed to Article 1403 -\"Establishment of Financial Institutions.\"\n\n88.\n\nSection B of Mexico's Schedule to Annex VII, entitled \"Establishment and Operation of Financial Institutions,\" confirms both the distinction between holding companies and other financial institutions and the understanding that both types of institutions come within the rubric of financial institutions. Paragraph 2 sets out maximum individual capital authorized for foreign financial affiliates of commercial banks, securities firms and insurance companies, respectively, and paragraphs 5-7 set out limits on the aggregate foreign capital in these and other specified financial institutions. No corresponding limits on foreign capital are placed on financial holding companies in Section B.\n\n89.\n\nIn paragraph 14 of Section B, Mexico reserved the right to limit eligibility to establish a foreign financial affiliate in Mexico to an investor of another Party engaged in the same general type of financial service in its home country, so that, say, a Canadian insurance company could establish an insurance affiliate in Mexico, but not a bank or securities firm. Paragraph 5 of Section C, however, provides that an investor of another Party that has established or acquired a commercial bank or a securities firm in accordance with Section B may establish a financial holding company to get around the restriction in paragraph 14 of Section B. Since Claimant argued vigorously that paragraph 5 of Section C supports its contention that a financial holding company is not a financial institution within the meaning of the NAFTA, *see, e.g.,* Borja Opinion at \u00b6 37, the complete text of paragraph 5 is set out both in English and Spanish:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| An investor of another Party that in | Un inversionista de otra Parte que |\n| accordance with Section B is authorized | conforme a la Secci\u00f3n B sea autorizado |\n| to establish or acquire, and establishes | a establecer o adquirir, y establezca o |\n| or acquires, a commercial bank or | adquiera en M\u00e9xico, una instituci\u00f3n de |\n| securities firm in Mexico may also | banca m\u00faltiple o una casa de bolsa, |\n| establish a financial holding company in | tambi\u00e9n podr\u00e1 establecer una sociedad |\n| Mexico, and thereby establish or acquire | controladora de agrupaciones |\n| other types of financial institutions in | financieras en M\u00e9xico, y por ese medio |\n| Mexico, under the terms of Mexican | establecer o adquirir otros tipos de |\n| measures. | instituciones financieras en M\u00e9xico, de conformidad con las medidas mexicanas. |\n\n90.\n\nClaimant argues that \"other types of financial institutions\" refers to the right of the holding company (if the other conditions are met) to acquire a bank or an insurance company or a securities firm - an interpretation with which the Tribunal has no difficulty. It does not follow, as the Tribunal interprets this paragraph, that a financial holding company is not a financial institution. As noted above, Section B sets out a series of maximum capital restrictions applicable to investors of another Party in specified financial institutions, as well as the right to limit eligibility of establish foreign affiliates to investors of another Party with experience in the same Sub-Sector. What paragraph 5 of Section C does, is to liberalize that restriction, so that by use of a financial holding company a qualified investor of another Party is able to diversify its participation in the financial services sector of Mexico. Nothing in paragraph C-5 suggests that it is designed to contradict or limit the classification of a sociedad controladora as a financial institution, as stated in Section A.\n\n91.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal understands that financial holding companies are governed somewhat differently under Mexican law from the kinds of financial institutions that deal directly with the public, such as commercial banks, insurance companies, and securities firms. The Tribunal concludes, however, that financial holding companies (sociedades controladoras) established in Mexico are financial institutions under the law of Mexico, and thus are within the meaning of Article 1416 of the NAFTA, since they are authorized to do business as a financial institution and are regulated and supervised as a financial institution under Mexican law.\n\n**D. Do the debentures in question constitute regulatory capital?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe conclusion that a sociedad controladara is a financial institution within the meaning of Article 1416 of the NAFTA, however, does not suffice to bring it under the coverage of Chapter Fourteen since paragraph 7 of the same article requires:\n\n**investment** means \"investment\" as defined in Article 1139 (Investment-Definitions), except that, with respect to \"loans\" and \"debt securities\" referred to in that Article:\n\n(a) a loan to or debt security issued by a financial institution is an investment only where it is treated as regulatory capital by the Party in whose territory the financial institution is located;\n\n93.\n\nRespondent takes the position that the convertible debentures in question are treated as regulatory capital in Mexico. Claimant, on the other hand, submits that, assuming the GF BanCrecer is a financial institution, they were not treated as regulatory capital because the sociedad controladora faced no capital adequacy requirements. The Tribunal holds that the convertible debentures in question are regulatory capital within the meaning of Article 1416(7)(a) for the following reasons.\n\n94.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that, as it is common ground between Claimant and Respondent, the NAFTA does not provide a definition of \"regulatory capital.\" Nor do the available travaux pr\u00e9paratoires. The Tribunal therefore has to interpret that term, as required by Article 31 (1) of the Vienna Convention of 1969, \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n95.\n\nThe object and purpose of the NAFTA in general and the particular concern regarding the field of financial services were reviewed in Section B above. The context in which the term appears is \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to (a) financial institutions of another Party; (b) investors of another Party, and investments of such investors, in financial institutions in the Party\u2019s territory; and (c) cross-border trade in financial services\" (Article 1401(1)).\n\n96.\n\nTwo questions then need to be addressed. First, are the convertible debentures in question treated as \"capital\" in Mexico? Second, if the answer to the first question is affirmative, is the capital in question subject to regulation by the relevant financial authorities in Mexico?\n\n97.\n\nThe answer to first question is indeed affirmative. The treatment of the debentures in question as capital of GF BanCrecer appears to be in conformity with Cirulares 1158 and 1384 issued by the CNBV, which constitute prudential measures.\n\n98.\n\nFrom copies of the audited financial statements of GF BanCrecer for the fiscal years 1995 through 1999, submitted as evidence by Respondent (Exh. R0257 -R0373), it appears that the Mexican financial holding company in reference presented the debentures as a component of its stockholders\u2019 equity (capital contable) during such periods. These statements also show that they were prepared pursuant to accounting rules and practices applicable to Mexican financial holding companies as set forth by the Commission in the Circulares, which rules and practices, as stated by the duly authorized auditors of GF BanCrecer in some cases differ from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as applicable in Mexico.3\n\nFurther references to these differences, specifically to the inclusion of the debentures in question as a component of the stockholders\u2019 equity (capital contable) of GF BanCrecer are detailed by the auditors in the notes to each of the audited financial statements of the Mexican financial holding company in reference for fiscal years 1995 (Note 6), 1996 (Note 8), 1997 (Note 17), 1998 (Notes 5 and 8) and 1999 (Notes 2, 5 and 8). *See* Exh. R0272, R0293, R0326, R0347, R0349, R0366, R0369 and R0371.\n\n99.\n\nIf the Basle Accord of 1988 were to be taken into account, it may be that the debentures in question cannot be counted as capital as they do not exactly meet the requirements of hybrid (debt/equity) capital instruments as defined in Annex 1(C)(d) to that Accord. In particular, the \"Acta de emisi\u00f3n de obligaciones subordinadas denominadas en d\u00f3lares estadounidenses convertibles forzosamente en t\u00edtulos representativos del capital del Grupo Financiero BanCrecer, S.A. de C.V.\" does not state that interest payments are to be deferred where the profitability of the financial institution would not support payment (as required by the fourth bullet point of Annex 1(C)(d)). However, they fulfill to a large extent the description given. This is reinforced by the reference in the Basle Accord of \"mandatory convertible debt instruments in the United States\" as an example of instruments eligible for inclusion. It is also to be noted that the debentures in question were not convertible at the option of the holder (i.e., Claimant), but rather mandatorily convertible into shares of GF BanCrecer after five years (with the option of conversion by Claimant after four years). In any event, whilst the Basle Accord appears to have been a source of inspiration of the Mexican legislator, Mexico was not a Party to that Accord. Thus, the Basle Accord cannot be viewed as a measure within the meaning of Article 201(1) of the NAFTA (\"measure includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice\").\n\n100.\n\nWith respect to the second question, as it is correctly pointed out by the Claimant, regulation by authorities of capital of financial institutions is ordinarily understood to refer to capital adequacy requirements in the sense of tier 1 and tier 2 capital, spread of capital, deductions, risk asset ratios, market risk, etc. These requirements do not appear to exist as such for capital of a sociedad controladora in Mexico.\n\n101.\n\nHowever, the lack of those requirements does not mean that the convertible debentures in question are not \"regulatory\" within the meaning of Article 1416(7)(a) of the NAFTA viewed in conjunction with the Mexican regulation of sociedades controladoras. In the context of Chapter Fourteen, the term \"regulatory\" is to be interpreted in a wider sense. Such interpretation is permitted since the carefully negotiated text of the NAFTA in general and Chapter Fourteen in particular do not refer in any manner to capital adequacy requirements in the sense described above. Rather, Article 1410(1) of the NAFTA points to the wider notion of prudential measures which are the underlying rationale of regulatory capital:\n\n1. Nothing in this Part shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining reasonable measures for prudential reasons, such as:\n\n(a) the protection of investors, depositors, financial market participants, policy-holders, policy-claimants, or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial institution or cross-border service provider;\n\n(b) the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions or cross-border service providers; and\n\n(c) ensuring the integrity and stability of a Party\u2019s financial system.\n\n102.\n\nThe LRAF requires that financial groups be constituted by a holding company which holds at least 51% of the paid up capital of and has control over the subsidiaries (LRAF, Articles 7 and 15). It also requires that financial groups have the authorization of the SHCP following the opinion of the Banco de Mexico and the CNBV (or, as the case may be, the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Seguros y Fianzas) (LRAF, Article 6). Financial accounting of the financial groups is subject to rules issued by the relevant supervising authority as determined by the SHCP considering the dominant entity within a specific financial group (LRAF, Article 30). The Circulares applicable to financial institutions, including a sociedad controladora, which are subject to the supervision of the CNBV provide for the manner in which financial institutions have to conduct their financial accounting and to present their annual accounts.\n\n103.\n\nArticle 2 of the CNBV Law (concerning \"Mexican financial entities\" as listed in Article 3 of said Law), which includes financial holding companies (\"sociedades controladoras de grupos financieros\"), sets out the objectives of the regulation and supervision undertaken by the CNBV over financial holding companies:\n\n... a fin de procurar su estabilidad y correcto funcionamiento, as\u00ed como mantener y fomentar el sano y equilibrado desarrollo del sistema financiero en su conjunto, en\n\n----\n\n... procure their stability and due operation, as well as to maintain and promote the healthy and balanced development of the financial system taken as a whole, in protection of the protecci\u00f3n de los intereses del p\u00fablico interests of the public \u2026\n\n104.\n\nArticle 4 of the CNBV Law grants the CNBV powers, among others, to:\n\n(a) issue prudential regulation within its competence, which shall be complied with by financial entities (sub-section II);\n\n(b) issue accounting rules applicable to financial entities (sub-section III);\n\n(c) establish rules for valuation of assets and, as appropriate, obligations and responsibilities of financial holding entities pursuant to applicable law (sub-section IV);\n\n(d) issue rules applicable to the information that must be periodically submitted to the CNBV by financial entities (sub-section V);\n\n(e) issue generally applicable regulations setting forth the characteristics and requirements that must be fulfilled and complied with by auditors of financial entities and the opinions issued by such auditors (sub-section VI), and\n\n(f) issue all rules necessary for due exercise of the powers granted to the CNBV pursuant to the CNBV Law and other applicable legislation, for due compliance with said rules, and for due enforcement of regulations issued pursuant to the abovementioned rules (sub-section VI).\n\n105.\n\nFurther, Article 6 of the CNBV Law expressly sets forth that the prudential regulation dictated by the Commission shall be oriented towards the preservation of the liquidity, solvency and stability of financial institutions, in accordance with the applicable law:\n\nPara los efectos de la fracci\u00f3n II del art\u00edculo 4 la Comisi\u00f3n, de conformidad con lo que establezcan las leyes relativas al sistema financiero, emitir\u00e1 normas de car\u00e1cter prudencial orientadas a preservar la liquidez, solvencia y estabilidad de las entidades financieras.\n\n----\n\nFor purposes of Section II of article 4, the Commission shall, pursuant to the laws relative to the financial system, issue prudential regulation designated to preserve the liquidity, solvency and stability of financial entities.\n\n106.\n\nThe capital of a sociedad controladora, which - as noted above - includes the convertible debentures in question, is subject to specific regulations and supervision, as is made clear in Article 23 of the LRAF:\n\nEl capital pagado y reservas de capital de la controladora se invertir\u00e1 de conformidad con las disposiciones de car\u00e1cter general que expida la Secretaria de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico, en lo siguiente:\n\nI.- Acciones emitidas por los dem\u00e1s integrantes del grupo.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis is the first case under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to be heard under Chapter Fourteen, devoted to cross-border investment in Financial Services. As spelled out in more detail in the Decision on the Preliminary Question in this case, the architects of the NAFTA were aware that the Governments of each of the State Parties regulated in considerable detail the activities of financial institutions engaged in securities transactions, insurance, banking and related activities. These regulations were often of a macro-economic character and involved prudential considerations of various kinds.\n\n2.\n\nThe regulations concerning financial services were not the same in all three countries, but each of the State Parties was clear that challenges to such regulations or interpretations of the regulations and the relevant authorities should not be committed to investor-State arbitration under the NAFTA. On the other hand investment in financial institutions across borders was to be encouraged, and investors were to be protected through the NAFTA from expropriation and measures tantamount to expropriation.\n\n3.\n\nThe solution arrived at in the NAFTA was to include a separate Chapter Fourteen on Financial Services. The expropriation provisions of the NAFTA as set out in Chapter Eleven, including the provisions for investor-State arbitration, were made applicable to claims under Chapter Fourteen, but claims based on other provisions designed to protect cross-border investors and investments, including provisions for National Treatment and Most-Favored-Nation Treatment, are excluded from the competence of an arbitral tribunal in a case involving investment in financial institutions. Chapter Fourteen contains no counterpart to Article 1105 concerning Minimum Standard of Treatment.\n\n4.\n\nIn its Decision on the Preliminary Question, the Tribunal held that the dispute between Claimant Fireman's Fund and Respondent Mexico did involve an investment in a financial institution as defined in Article 1416 of the NAFTA. Accordingly, the competence of the Tribunal and the scope of the Award in the present case are limited to the issue of whether an expropriation of Claimant's property has occurred, and if so, what compensation may be owing.\n\n**II. THE CLAIM**\n-----------------\n\n5.\n\nFireman's Fund claims that the Government of Mexico expropriated its investment in Grupo Financiero BanCrecer, S.A. in violation of Article 1110 of the NAFTA. The Government of Mexico deprived Fireman's Fund of the use and value of its investment, and did so in a discriminatory and arbitrary manner. Further, according to Fireman's Fund, the Government of Mexico failed to compensate Fireman's Fund for the fair market value of that investment as required by Article 1110. In so doing, the Government of Mexico violated its obligations under Article 1110.\n\n6.\n\nFireman's Fund seeks the following relief:\n\nFor the foregoing reasons [set forth in the Reply to the Merits], and those set forth in Fireman's Fund Memorial on the Merits, Fireman's Fund respectfully requests that the Tribunal find that the Government of Mexico, through its acts and omissions described above and in its Memorial, expropriated Fireman's Fund's investment in dollar-denominated debentures issued by Grupo Financiero in violation of Article 1110 of the NAFTA. Accordingly, Fireman's Fund will request that the Tribunal award it compensation for the full value of its investment-that is, for US$ 50 million plus interest based on a 90-day LIBOR rate plus four percent from the taking until the date of payment, compounded annually.\n\nClaimant also respectfully requests an award of its legal fees and other costs incurred in connection with this proceeding.1\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 116-117, amending Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 139-140.\n\n7.\n\nRespondent Mexico does not accept the version of the facts of Fireman's Fund but maintains that in any event whatever losses Claimant may have sustained were not the result of an expropriation within the meaning of the NAFTA.\n\n8.\n\nRespondent Mexico seeks the following relief:\n\n*Por lo expuesto, el gobierno de M\u00e9xico sostiene que el Tribunal debe desechar la reclamaci\u00f3n de Fireman's Fund en su totalidad, con la correspondiente condena en costas a favor de M\u00e9xico*.2\n\n[Translation:\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Government of Mexico submits that the Tribunal should reject the claim of Fireman's Fund in its totality, with the corresponding award of costs in favour of Mexico.]\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6 316; Rejoinder on the Merits \u00b6 279.\n\n**III. THE PARTIES**\n--------------------\n\n9.\n\nClaimant :\n\nFireman's Fund Insurance Company\n\n777 San Marin Drive\n\nNovato, CA 94998\n\nUnited States of America\n\nherein: \"Fireman's Fund,\" \"FFIC,\" or \"Claimant.\"\n\n10.\n\nFireman's Fund is incorporated under the laws of the State of California, United States.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 30 October 2001, Fireman's Fund submitted a Notice of Arbitration against Mexico pursuant to the provisions of Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA and requested that the claims set forth therein be submitted to arbitration under the Additional Facility Rules of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\").\n\n15.\n\nIn the Notice of Arbitration, Fireman's Fund alleged violations by Mexico of Articles 1102, 1105, 1110 and 1405 of the NAFTA and sought, with respect to each of its claims under those Articles, \"an award of damages in its favor and against Mexico of US$ 50,000,000, together with applicable interest, its attorneys' fees and the costs incurred by it in this proceeding, together with such further and additional relief as the Arbitral Tribunal may deem appropriate.\" (Notice, \u00b6 40).\n\n16.\n\nFireman's Fund supplemented its Notice of Arbitration by two letters dated 27 November 2001 and 11 January 2002.\n\n17.\n\nMexico submitted a letter dated 11 December 2001 in which it raised concerns about the applicability of Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA in the present case.\n\n18.\n\nOn 15 January 2002, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the parties that Fireman's Fund's application for access to the Additional Facility was approved and issued on the same day a Certificate of Registration of the Notice.\n\n19.\n\nOn 17 May 2002, the Arbitral Tribunal was constituted. The Tribunal was composed of Professor Albert Jan van den Berg (appointed as President of the Tribunal by the Secretary-General of ICSID), of Dutch nationality, residing at Tervuren, Belgium, Professor Andreas F. Lowenfeld (appointed by Claimant), of US nationality, residing at New York, New York, and Mr. Francisco Carrillo Gamboa (appointed by Respondent), of Mexican nationality, residing at Mexico, DF, Mexico. Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson of ICSID was designated to serve as Secretary to the Tribunal. All subsequent written communications between the Tribunal and the parties were made through the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n20.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held, with the parties' agreement, in Washington, D.C., on 22 July 2002. The Summary of the First Session is deemed incorporated into this Award.\n\n21.\n\nAt the first session it was agreed by the parties that the proceedings in the present case would be divided into three phases. The first phase would concern the Preliminary Question, the second phase would concern the merits of the case only as to liability, and the third phase, if necessary, would concern the quantification of damages.\n\n22.\n\nBy a Decision on the Preliminary Question dated 17 July 2003, which was communicated to the parties on 13 August 2003 and is attached to this Award as an Annex, the Tribunal rendered the following decisions:\n\n(1) HOLDS that Claimant's claims brought under Articles 1102, 1105 and 1405 of the NAFTA are not within the competence of the Tribunal, but that claims brought under Article 1110 are within its competence;\n\n(2) RESERVES decision on the costs of the present phase of the arbitration;\n\n(3) DETERMINES that the further conduct of the arbitration will be determined by the Tribunal after consultation with the parties.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter of 26 August 2003, the Tribunal invited the parties to agree on an appropriate schedule for the next stage of the proceedings. By letter of 9 September 2003, the parties submitted an agreed schedule for the merits phase (the \"Schedule\"), which the Tribunal approved on 8 October 2003.\n\n24.\n\nExcept as set out below, each party made numerous requests for documents of the other party, and eventually these requests were either granted or ordered by the Tribunal or rejected. Throughout the proceedings, the parties' numerous procedural applications were promptly and unanimously decided by the Tribunal. The Tribunal is persuaded that no document that should have come before the Tribunal was missing in any way that affected the outcome of the case.\n\n25.\n\nOn 25 June 2004, FFIC submitted a Memorial on the Merits with accompanying witness statements and exhibits.\n\n26.\n\nOn 31 January 2005, Mexico filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (*Escrito de Contestaci\u00f3n*) with accompanying exhibits.\n\n27.\n\nOn 28 July 2004, FFIC had solicited the Tribunal's assistance in producing a legal opinion authored by Mr. Francisco Carrillo Gamboa, at that time one of the members of the Tribunal, and addressed to Grupo Financiero Bancrecer S.A. de C.V. (the \"Carrillo Opinion\").3 On 23 February 2005, FFIC informed the Tribunal that it had located a copy of the Carrillo Opinion and enclosed a copy thereof. On 2 March 2005, Mr. Carrillo wrote to the Secretary-General of ICSID and the other members of the Tribunal to advise them of his decision to resign as arbitrator in the present case. On 3 March 2005, the ICSID Secretariat declared the proceedings suspended in accordance with Article 16(2) of the Additional Facility Arbitration Rules and invited the Tribunal to consider the reasons for Mr. Carrillo's resignation and decide whether it consented thereto. On 7 March 2005, the Tribunal consented to the resignation of Mr. Carrillo as arbitrator. On 15 April 2005, Mexico appointed Mr. Alberto Guillermo Saavedra Olavarrieta as arbitrator in replacement of Mr. Carrillo. On 26 April 2005, the ICSID Secretariat informed the parties that Mr. Saavedra had accepted his appointment as arbitrator and that the proceedings were resumed.\n\n*See also \u00b6* 85 *infra.*\n\n28.\n\nOn 26 April 2005, the ICSID Secretariat also circulated three letters from FFIC dated 4 and 8 March 2005 and 25 April 2005, as well as a letter from Mexico dated 16 March 2005, all received during the suspension of the proceedings.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter of 4 March 2005 (circulated on 26 April 2005), FFIC alleged that Mexico had exerted pressure on the witness Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda not to testify in the second phase of these proceedings, and requested, *inter alia*, that the Tribunal issue an order calling for Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda to give testimony. Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda was formerly the President of the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores (\"CNBV\") and had testified for FFIC in relation to the Preliminary Question. Mexico denied FFIC's allegations in a letter of 27 April 2005. By Order No. 6 dated 12 May 2005, Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda was called to give testimony at the upcoming hearing, and the parties were requested to use their best efforts to agree upon all practical aspects relating to his testimony. Following correspondence between the parties regarding the ability of Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda to testify, on 23 June 2005, the Tribunal advised the parties that it had noted the unavailability of Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda as witness in the present phase of the proceedings, deciding in this respect that the evidence that he had given in the first phase of the proceedings would not be declared inadmissible, without prejudice to its relevance, weight or materiality.\n\n30.\n\nOn 31 May 2005, FFIC filed a Reply on the Merits with accompanying witness statements and exhibits.\n\n31.\n\nOn 5 August 2005, Mexico filed a Rejoinder on the Merits (*Escrito de D\u00faplica*) dated 4 August 2005 with accompanying exhibits and witness statements. A corrected version of which was submitted on 10 August 2005.\n\n32.\n\nOn 18 August 2005, the parties filed witness notifications.\n\n33.\n\nOn 2 September 2005, the Government of Canada filed a submission pursuant to Article 1128 of the NAFTA. The Government of the United States of America did not make any submission.\n\n34.\n\nOn 8 September 2005, following FFIC's request for reconsideration of its ruling of 24 August 2005, the Tribunal advised the parties that it maintained its refusal to strike certain witness statements as requested by FFIC, but gave permission to the parties to file a pre-hearing brief on any matter deemed relevant for the forthcoming hearing, which the parties did on 21 September 2005.\n\n35.\n\nOn 22 September 2005, Mexico filed objections regarding the admissibility of FFIC's Pre-Hearing Brief and the exhibit and two witness statements attached thereto. The objections were rejected by the Tribunal on 26 September 2005.\n\n36.\n\nOn 22 September 2005, a pre-hearing telephone conference was held between the President of the Tribunal and the parties to discuss procedural matters relating to the hearing to be held on the merits (the \"Hearing\").\n\n37.\n\nIn September 2005, Mr. Eduardo Cepeda Fern\u00e1ndez, the representative of JP Morgan in Mexico, proposed to be called as a witness by Claimant, advised FFIC that he would not be able to testify. By letter of 20 September 2005, FFIC alleged that Mexico had pressured Mr. Cepeda not to appear further in these proceedings. Mexico denied said allegations by letter of 21 September 2005. Pursuant to a request by the President made during the pre-hearing telephone conference, FFIC wrote on 22 September 2005 to Mr. Cepeda inviting him to reconsider his decision not to appear as witness at the Hearing. Mr. Cepeda maintained his refusal.\n\n38.\n\nThe Hearing was held from 27 September until 1 October 2005 in Washington D.C. Mr. Daniel M. Price, Mr. Stanimir A. Alexandrov, Mr. Raymundo E. Enriquez, Judge Stephen M. Schwebel, Dr. Gerhart Reuss, Ms. Katherine Crocker, Mr. Peter Lefkin, Mr. David J.

By letters of 11 and 25 October 2005, Claimant and Respondent advised the Tribunal that they had no objection to Mr. Saavedra's continued service on the Tribunal following his disclosure of 29 September 2005.\n\n42.\n\nIn the course of the Hearing, the parties submitted an agreed List of Dramatis Personae, as well as a Consolidated List of Exhibits (which was updated by FFIC on 6 October 2005).\n\n43.\n\nBy letter of 24 March 2006, FFIC drew the Tribunal's attention to the Partial Award rendered on 17 March 2006 in *Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v.* *The Czech Republic*.4 At the request of the Tribunal, FFIC submitted brief comments on the relevance of the *Saluka* award on 21 April 2006, and Mexico responded on 17 May 2006.\n\nAvailable at: http://www.pca-cpa.org/ENGLISH/RPC/SAL-CZ%20Partial%20Award%20170306.pdf\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal declared the proceedings closed on 7 July 2006.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal deliberated at several occasions.\n\n**V. FACTS**\n------------\n\n46.\n\nIn the Decision of 17 July 2003, the Tribunal made a number of factual findings relevant to the Preliminary Question without prejudice to its factual findings on the merits of this case. The factual findings in the present Chapter (and Chapter VII below) are based on the entire record in this case, including the merits phase.\n\n47.\n\nAt the outset it is useful to give a brief overview of the relevant competent authorities in Mexico:\n\n*- Banco de M\u00e9xico* is the central bank of the country and is an independent legal person of public law. Its primary objective is to maintain the stability of the national currency and, additionally, to promote the proper development of the financial system and to foster the proper functioning of the payment system.\n\n- The *Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores* (\"CNBV\" or \"Commission,\" formerly *Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria*) is authorized to supervise and regulate financial entities in order to provide for their stability and proper functioning as well as to maintain and promote the proper and balanced development of the financial system and, in connection therewith, the protection of the public interest.\n\n- The *Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico* (\"SHCP\" Ministry of Finance and Public Credit, also referred to as Ministry of Finance) is a division of the federal executive power, whose principal function is to define the policies of the federal Government in matters of tax, public spending, financing, creditworthiness, banking, money, currency and pricing, and tariffs for goods and services of the public sector.\n\n- The *Fondo Bancario de Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro* (\"FOBAPROA,\" Fund for the Protection of Bank Savings) is a Trust Fund (*fideicomiso*) established pursuant to Article 122 of the *Ley de Instituciones de Cr\u00e9dito* (Act of Credit Institutions, also called Banking Act) whose objective was to take preventive measures in order to avoid financial problems of \" *instituciones de banca m\u00faltiple* \" [multiple service banking institutions] as well as compliances of those institutions with their obligations. The Fund functioned as a form of deposit insurance. The *Comit\u00e9 T\u00e9cnico* [Technical Committee] of FOBAPROA was charged with the approval of FOBAPROA's measures.\n\n- The *Instituto para la Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro Bancario* (\"IPAB,\" Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings) took over FOBAPROA's responsibilities in January 1999.\n\n- The *Grupo de Trabajo* (\"Working Group\"), consisting of representatives of Banco de M\u00e9xico, the CNBV, the SHCP, and FOBAPROA (IPAB as of January 1999), is an inter-agency taskforce that was formed to address the financial crisis that arose in Mexico in November - December 1994. CNBV was the lead agency. The Working Group is considered in more detail in Section VII.C below.\n\n48.\n\nEnd 1994, a serious financial crisis broke out in Mexico. The Mexican peso declined significantly in relation to the United States dollar and interest rates soared. In the first semester of 1995, the Peso declined in value not less than 96%. That had a significant effect on the financial position of many Mexican banks.\n\n49.\n\nIn order to combat the financial crisis which could lead to a collapse of the Mexican financial system, the Mexican authorities adopted a series of measures, *inter alia*, to support banks and depositors and to re-establish their viability. One of those measures was the *Programa de Capitalizaci\u00f3n y Compra de Cartera* [Program of Capitalization and Acquisition of Portfolio] (the \"PCCC\"). The PCCC consisted of a scheme under which the Government, through FOBAPROA, assumed non-performing loan portfolios from the participating banks in exchange for interest bearing notes issued by FOBAPROA payable in 10 years, and guaranteed by the Government. The assumption of the loans improved the banks' financial condition by taking non-performing loans off the banks' balance sheets, and adding interest-generating Government notes to the asset side of the banks' books in their stead. The assumption of the loan portfolio and the issuance of the notes were conditioned upon the bank securing additional funds to increase the capitalization of the bank. As a rule, for each peso contributed by the shareholders or others to capital, the Government assumed two pesos' worth of loan portfolio. Some 11 banks participated in the PCCC, including BanCrecer.5 When a bank participated, it entered into an agreement called \" *Bases de Capitalizaci\u00f3n* \" with CNBV and FOBAPROA.6\n\nBanco Nacional de M\u00e9xico, S.A.; Bancomer, S.A. (merged with Banco Bilbao Vizcaya - \"BBV\"); Banco Mercantil del Norte, S.A.; Banca Serfin, S.A. (Serfin); Banco Internacional, S.A.; Banco Vizcaya-M\u00e9xico, S.A.; Banco del Atl\u00e1ntico, S.A. (Atl\u00e1ntico); Banca Promex, S.A. (Promex); Conf\u00eda, S.A. (Conf\u00eda); BanCrecer, S.A. (BanCrecer); BanOro, S.A. (BanOro, merged with BanCrecer); and Banco Mexicano, S.A. Exh. R2346.\n\n**[** *REDACTED* **]**\n\n50.\n\nGrupo Financiero BanCrecer, S.A. de C.V., (hereinafter: \"GFB\"), a Mexican corporation, is the holding company of, *inter alia*, BanCrecer, S.A., Instituci\u00f3n de Banca M\u00faltiple, (hereinafter: \"BanCrecer\" or the \"Bank\"). In 1995, GFB was owned by public shareholders (43.4%) and a so-called Core Investor Group (56.6% **[***REDACTED***]**). In 1995, GFB was in serious financial difficulties.\n\n51.\n\nAs mentioned before, Claimant Fireman's Fund Insurance Company (\"FFIC\" or \"Fireman's Fund\") of Novato, California, United States of America, is an insurance company founded some 150 years ago, whose principal business is the provision of various types of insurance, including accident and fire insurance. FFIC is part of the Allianz Group of companies, a global player in the property, life, and casualty insurance industry. FFIC is a wholly owned subsidiary of Allianz of America, Inc., a Delaware corporation (\"Allianz of America\" or \"AZOA\"), which also owns Allianz M\u00e9xico, S.A. (\"Allianz M\u00e9xico\" or \"AZMEX\"), a Mexican company involved in the provision of insurance services. Thus, FFIC and Allianz M\u00e9xico are sister companies within the Allianz Group. Allianz of America is in turn owned by Allianz AG of Munich, Germany. Two persons who played a significant role within the Allianz Group in this case need to be mentioned here: Dr. Gerhart E. Reuss, Chairman of Allianz M\u00e9xico, and Mr. Herbert Hansmeyer, member of the Board of Allianz AG and Chairman of the Board of Directors of FFIC.\n\n52.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Allianz M\u00e9xico wanted to strengthen its existing industrial insurance business in Mexico. In particular, it was interested in building up a business of so-called \"personal lines\" of insurance (life insurance, automobile insurance and household insurance). Allianz M\u00e9xico believed that the best way to expand its business was to seek an alliance with an existing Mexican bank whose branch offices could be used as outlets for sales of insurance products.8 Allianz M\u00e9xico identified BanCrecer for that purpose.\n\nReuss II, \u00b6 4.\n\n53.\n\n**[** *REDACTED* **]**, Allianz AG and GFB signed a **[** *REDACTED***]** GFB was to pass over to the Joint Venture Company all its life insurance business and Allianz M\u00e9xico was to do the same with respect to its life and health insurance.\n\n54.\n\nOn the same date, JP Morgan, retained by Allianz, made a presentation to Allianz M\u00e9xico concerning **[** *the bank holding company.***]** On 4 September 1995, JP Morgan **[** *provided additional analysis of that company.***]**\n\n55.\n\nOn 20 September 1995, GFB issued US$ 50 million in dollar-nominated mandatorily convertible five year subordinated debentures,12 which were purchased by FFIC on 29 September 1995 (the \"Dollar Debentures\").\n\nExh. R0086-0106; *see also* Exh. R0128-0145.\n\n56.\n\nAlso on 20 September 1995, GFB issued similar convertible subordinated debentures denominated in Mexican pesos, the value of which was equivalent to US$ 50 million at the time (the \"Peso Debentures\").13 It is common ground between the parties that the Peso Debentures were purchased by Mexican nationals.\n\nExh. R0107-0127; *see also* Exh. R0146-0164.\n\n57.\n\nThe issuance of the Peso and Dollar Debentures had previously been approved by Banco de M\u00e9xico on 15 September 1 995.14\n\nExh. R0050-0055.\n\n58.\n\nOn 29 September 1995, the following documents were executed:\n\n(a) **[** *An agreement that provided for an increase of BanCrecer's capital* *including the issuance by GFB of the Peso Debentures and Dollar Debentures; and provided for the assumption by FOBAPROA of part of the loan portfolio of BanCrecer against notes issued by FOBAPROA and guaranteed by the Mexican Government.***]** 16\n\n(b) **[**18*An agreement between GFB and FFIC concerning the purchase of dollar debentures.***]**\n\n(c) **[** *An agreement between GFB and Allianz of America, Inc. regarding the* *establishment of a joint venture in Mexico.***]**\n\n**[** *REDACTED* **]** \"CMM\" refers herein to the exhibits to Claimant's Memorial on the Merits.\"\n\n**[** *REDACTED* **]**\n\n59.\n\nIn October 1995, Dr. Gerhart Reuss was elected to serve as member of the Board of Directors of GFB and as a \" *miembro suplente* \" [\"alternate member\"] of the Board of Directors of BanCrecer.\n\n60.\n\nSome MPX 5,467 million worth of loan portfolio were transferred by BanCrecer and BanOro to FOBAPROA **[** *REDACTED* **]** with value date 28 September 1995. **[** *REDACTED* **]** In a report dated 20 September 1996 addressed to BanCrecer, BanOro and CNBV, Mancera, S.C. Ernst & Young determined that loans totalling MPX 426 million out of the MPX 5,467 million had the risk level \"E\" and that the loan portfolio required MXP 448 million of \" *provisiones preventivas* \" [\"contingent reserves\"] in addition to those determined by the Banks.20 That and other related matters caused further discussion between BanCrecer (and BanOro) and FOBAPROA about the loans that qualified for the transfer and the required reserves.\n\nExh. C0765-777, CMM 10. **[** *REDACTED***]**\n\n61.\n\n**[ ]** a \"Master Agreement\" **[***REDACTED***]** was to the effect that the life insurance business was left in the hands of Allianz M\u00e9xico, while BanCrecer would continue to make available its branch network to Allianz M\u00e9xico for the sale of life insurance as well car and household insurance. Allianz M\u00e9xico \"bought out\" BanCrecer by a US$ 30 million debt instrument and a US$ 10 million in the purchase of an equity interest in GFB by Allianz M\u00e9xico (which acquired as result a 3.16% interest in GFB). **[***REDACTED***]**\n\n62.\n\nIn the meantime, the financial position of BanCrecer further deteriorated. It necessitated another **[***REDACTED***]** capital injection **[***REDACTED* **]** against a further assumption by FOBAPROA of part of BanCrecer's loan portfolio **[***REDACTED***]**\n\n63.\n\nIn the year 1997, the financial position of BanCrecer again deteriorated. One of the reasons was that on 1 January 1997 new accounting principles for financial institutions entered into force in Mexico. On 28 August 1997, GFB deposited its entire paid up shareholding in BanCrecer in favour of FOBAPROA with S.D. Indeval, S.A. de C.V., Instituci\u00f3n para el Dep\u00f3sito de Valores. On 25 November 1997, GFB retained JP Morgan to assist it in the evaluation of GFB's current financial position and in making an estimation of the capital needs and projected performance of BanCrecer.\n\n64.\n\nAt the same time, and according to FFIC unbeknownst to it, BanCrecer sought permission from CNBV by two letters of 17 November 1997 to create a trust to \"repurchase\" the Peso Debentures at par value.26 According to BanCrecer, a number of Peso Debenture holders had claimed that the documentation for acquiring those Debentures was legally deficient **.** The Trust (\"Fideicomiso No. 9285-9 BanCrecer\") was created on 28 November 1997,27 which was controlled by BanCrecer. The \"repurchase\" of the Debentures by the Trust was financed by a loan of BanCrecer, originally of MXP 250 million and later increased to the full amount of the par value of the Peso Debentures of MXP 500 million to the Trust.28 By letter of 8 December 1997, CNBV gave BanCrecer permission to \"repurchase\" the Debentures, subject to a number of conditions.29\n\nExh. R0166-0168 and C0744-0751, CMM 7.\n\nExh. R0169-0171.\n\nThe original loan of MXP 250 million was authorized by BanCrecer's Executive Committee on 21 February 1998 (Exh. C0800, CMM 15), and the increase to MXP 500 million on 19 May 1998 (Exh. C0801, CMM 16).\n\nExh. R0172-0173.\n\n65.\n\nAt the end of 1997 and in the beginning of 1998, BanCrecer and JP Morgan developed a Recapitalization Plan to rescue BanCrecer for submission to the Mexican financial authorities.30 The Recapitalization Plan as developed by BanCrecer and JP Morgan met resistance of the Government officials who insisted that the entire existing equity capital in BanCrecer should be written off to zero against previous losses and capital deficits. The Recapitalization Plan would have involved a new foreign strategic partner for 40% of BanCrecer equity. JP Morgan and the Allianz Group (in particular Dr. Reuss) contacted various foreign banks for that purpose, including in particular Argentaria, a Spanish bank.\n\n**[** *REDACTED* **]**\n\n66.\n\nThe Recapitalization Plan was the subject of an urgent meeting in the evening of Thursday 26 February 1998, convened at the office of Governor of Banco de M\u00e9xico. At that meeting participated Dr. Reuss (FFIC/Allianz), Mr. Eduardo Cepeda (JP Morgan), Mr. Alc\u00e1ntara (GFB/BanCrecer), Mr. Guillermo Ortiz (Governor of Banco de M\u00e9xico), Mr. Eduardo Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda (President of CNBV), and Mr. Javier Arrigunaga (Director General of FOBAPROA). The Plan discussed at that meeting31 consisted in essence of a separation into a \"Good Bank\" and a \"Bad Bank,\" a merger of GFB and its other subsidiaries with BanCrecer, and a 40-40-20 split in shareholding, 40% for the existing Mexican shareholders, 40% for a new foreign strategic partner and 20% for FFIC in the cleaned-up bank. FFIC's 20% equity participation would consist of its US$ 50 million Debentures and an additional US$ 50 million investment. The nonperforming loan portfolio would be taken over by the Government in a trust. The new foreign partner was to contribute US$ 200 million in equity. FFIC (Allianz) would attract the foreign strategic partner. If it failed to do so, the Government would repay FFIC US$ 25 million of the US$ 50 million Debentures. The parties to the present case disagree whether the Plan as discussed at this meeting constituted an agreement between FFIC and Mexico.\n\n**[** *REDACTED***]** \"CMPQ\" refers herein to the exhibits to Claimant's Memorial on the Preliminary Question.\n\n67.\n\nThe next day, Friday 27 February 1998, FOBAPROA's Technical Committee met. The parties disagree whether the minutes of the meeting **[** *REDACTED*32**]** which were unknown to GFB, BanCrecer, FFIC and JP Morgan at the time, show that the Technical Committee approved the plan allegedly adopted the evening before.\n\n**[** *REDACTED* **]**\n\n68.\n\nOn the same day, Friday 27 February 1998, GFB and JP Morgan issued a press release.33 The three bullet points in the heading of the press release read:\n\n\u2022 Se aprueban las medidas para el saneamiento definitivo de BanCrecer.\n\n\u2022 Nuevos inversionistas, conjuntamente con un grupo de los accionistas actuales aportar\u00e1n recursos por $ 500 millones de d\u00f3lares.\n\n\u2022 El nuevo capital de BanCrecer estar\u00e1 representado en su mayor\u00eda por capital extranjero *.*\n\n[Translation:\n\n*\u2022* The measures for the definitive restructuring of BanCrecer are approved.\n\n*\u2022* New investors, jointly with a group of current shareholders, will contribute resources of US$ 500 million.\n\n*\u2022* The majority of the new capital of BanCrecer will be represented by foreign capital.]\n\nExh. C0103, CMPQ 8; *see also* R2930.\n\n69.\n\nClaimant contends that the draft of the press release was discussed with, and approved by, Mexican officials. Mexico denies this. In any event, the press release was reported in the Mexican newspapers the next day34 and the Mexican authorities did not seek a rectification of the press reports or otherwise made known that the reporting was incorrect.\n\nExh. C01180-1187, CRM 69.\n\n70.\n\nBy letter of 16 April 1998, BanCrecer sent CNBV the trust agreement of 28 November 1997.35 That letter was shown to Dr. Reuss a few days later by **[r** *a government official. Dr. Reuss reported to his management on the circumstances surrounding the repurchase of the peso-dominated debentures.***]**\n\nExh. C0104-0107, CMPQ 9.\n\n71.\n\n**[** *Dr. Reuss also reported to his management on his meeting with a high-ranking government official regarding the repurchase of the peso-dominated bonds.***]** **[***REDACTED***]**\n\n72.\n\n**[***REDACTED***]**\n\n73.\n\nThe Peso Debenture \"repurchase\" by the Trust controlled by BanCrecer was substantially completed July 1998.37 While the \"repurchase\" was initiated due to alleged deficiencies in certain subscriptions (referred to as \" *sin contrato* \" [\"without contract\"]), in the course of 1998, the decision was taken to apply it to all Peso Debentures because, as alleged by Mexico in the present arbitration, it was impossible to distinguish between Peso Debentures \" *sin contrato* \" [\"without contract\"] and \" *con contrato* \" [\"with contract\"]. On 12 August 1998, CNBV wrote to GFB that it had taken note (\" *se ha tomado nota* \") of the procedure.38 On the same day, CNBV wrote to BanCrecer with reference to the letter to GFB that its letter of 8 December 1997 had become \"without effect\" (\" *sin efecto* \").39 FFIC infers from those letters that CNBV had approved the \"repurchase\" and that CNBV had lifted the restrictions set forth in its letter of 8 December 1997. Mexico disputes that inference.\n\n*See* letter of 13 July 1998 from BanCrecer to CNBV, Exh. C0108-0110, CMPQ 10.\n\nExh. C0029, CMPQ 11.\n\nExh. C0802, CMM 17.\n\n74.\n\nThe follow up of the discussions regarding the Recapitalization Plan on 26 and 27 February 1998 was the preparation by JP Morgan of a \" *Programa de Saneamiento* *y Capitalizaci\u00f3n - Resumen de T\u00e9rminos y Condiciones\"* [\"Summary of Terms and Conditions of the Restructuring and Capitalization Program\"] dated May 1998.40 The header on each page of this document reads: \"May 1998. Terms and Conditions Sheet. DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION.\" The last page is a signature page for SHCP, Banco de M\u00e9xico, FOBAPROA, CNBV and \"Grupo de Inversionistas\" (by: Mr. Alc\u00e1ntara). The document is referred to in this arbitration as the \"Memorandum of Understanding\" or the \"Memorandum of Intent.\" The italicized introduction to the Memorandum of Intent states:\n\n*The following terms and conditions reflect the agreement reached between the Grupo Financiero BanCrecer, S.A. de C.V. (the \"Group\") shareholder group led by Mr. Roberto Alc\u00e1ntara Rojas (the \"Investor Group\"), the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (\"SHCP\"), the Bank of Mexico, the Mexican Banking and Securities Commission (\"CNBV\"), [and] the Bank Fund to Protect Savings (\"Fobaproa\"), which have been ratified by F* *OBAPROA* *'s Technical Committee to carry out the Restructuring and Capitalization Program for BanCrecer, S.A.

C0046-0055, CMPQ 5=C0703-0712, unofficial English translation at C0713-C0721.\n\n75.\n\nThe stated purpose of the Memorandum of Intent is: \"Define the terms and conditions pursuant to which the Investor Group intends to participate, with the support of the Federal Government, in the Bank's Restructuring and Capitalization Program\" (clause 1). The Memorandum of Intent deals with: Restructuring of the Bank (clause 2); Capitalization and Sale of the Bank (clause 3); Shareholder Structure (clause 4); FOBAPROA Funding (clause 5); Trust Administration (clause 6); Investor Group Commitments (clause 7); Indemnities (clause 8); Authorizations (clause 9); and Confidentiality (clause 10).\n\n76.\n\nMr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Garc\u00eda, Senior Executive Vice-President of GFB from June 1997 until July 1999, testified that the Memorandum of Intent was developed by JP Morgan \"in discussions with the Mexican financial authorities.\"41 On the other hand, the witnesses appearing for Mexico in the arbitration testified that they had not seen the Memorandum of Intent until the present arbitration.\n\nGarc\u00eda I, \u00b6 34.\n\n77.\n\nIn March - April 1998, the Mexican Government presented financial reform legislation to the Mexican Congress. Congress then embarked on a critical examination of the financial authorities dealing with the crisis, in particular, FOBAPROA. In late 1998, Congress requested an audit of FOBAPROA. Thereafter, FOBAPROA was replaced by IPAB pursuant to the *Ley de Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro Bancario* [Law for the Protection of Bank Savings] adopted by Congress in December 1998 and published in the *Diario Oficial* [Official Gazette] of 19 January 1999 (entry into force on 20 January 1999).42 Article Ninth of the Transitional Provisions of the Law43 refers to a Section Four of the \" *Resumen Ejecutivo de las Operaciones realizadas por* [FOBAPROA]\" [\"Executive Summary of the Operations carried out by [FOBAPROA]\"] in which it is mentioned that \" *se* *prev\u00e9n los montos necesarios para las operaciones de saneamiento financiero* *correspondientes a Banco del Atl\u00e1ntico, S.A., Banca Promex, S.A. y BanCrecer, S.A., y que a la fecha no se han finalizado*.\" [\"The amounts needed for the operations of financial restructuring corresponding to Banco del Atl\u00e1ntico, S.A., Banca Promex, S.A. and BanCrecer, S.A., have been planned for, but as of this date have not been finalized.\"] Article Ninth required IPAB to proceed to \" *evaluar, auditar y, en su caso, concluir, dichas operaciones* \" [\"evaluate, audit, and, as the case may be conclude said operations\"]. One of the conditions imposed by Article Ninth for concluding the operations was that \" *Se aplicar\u00e1 integralmente el capital de las instituciones mencionadas a cubrir sus p\u00e9rdidas* \" [\"The capital of the afore-mentioned institutions shall be fully applied to cover its losses\"].\n\nExh. C0217-0235, Exh. CMPQ 17. Any person who had been Secretary of SHCP, Governor of the Banco de M\u00e9xico, or President of CNBV and in that capacity member of the Technical Committee of FOBAPROA during the period 1995-1997 was prohibited from being a member of the Executive Committee or Executive Secretary of IPAB (Second Article of the Transitional Provisions, Exh. C0231).\n\nExh. C0233-0234, CMPQ 17.\n\n78.\n\nIn the meantime, FFIC and JP Morgan were actively seeking a strategic foreign partner. In the arbitration FFIC claims that it could not really interest foreign banks to participate since the Memorandum of Intent had not been signed. Moreover, it was unclear whether the split in the new bank would be 40-40-20 as foreseen in the plan but not yet legally possible in Mexico. The plan anticipated that Mexican law would change in that regard, but Congress did not adopt legislation to that effect. It was then envisaged that a foreign party would have 51% control via a subsidiary, which was possible under Mexican law. That, in turn, required convincing Mr. Alc\u00e1ntara, the principal shareholder of GFB, who initially resisted the concept of foreign control.\n\n79.\n\nIn fall 1998, the situation was described in another letter from Dr. Reuss to Mr. Hansmeyer (captioned **[** *REDACTED* **]**) as follows:44\n\n**[***REDACTED***]**\n\n**[***REDACTED***]**\n\n[capitals as in original]\n\n**[** *REDACTED* **]**\n\n80.\n\nOn 11 November 1998, FOBAPROA advised BanCrecer that it had returned the entire loan portfolio.45**[***REDACTED***]** GFB appears to have accepted the return in a letter of 14 October 1999.47\n\nExh. C0215-0216, CMPQ 16.\n\nExh. R1923-1924.\n\n81.\n\nIn January 1999, JP Morgan continued its discussions with BBV to interest them in a participation in a sanitized BanCrecer.48\n\n*See* Memorandum of 26 January 1999 and proposal to BBV (Exh. C0113-C0131, CMPQ 13, and C0132-0208, CMPQ 14).\n\n82.\n\nAs mentioned above, in January 1999 the *Instituto para la Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro Bancario* (\"IPAB\" Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings) took over\n\nFOBAPROA's responsibilities. IPAB devised a new plan for BanCrecer, whereby it would take over BanCrecer and auction it to the highest bidder.\n\n83.\n\nBy letter of 5 April 1999 from Allianz M\u00e9xico (Dr. Reuss) to SHCP, Banco de M\u00e9xico, and CNBV,49 Dr. Reuss recalled the agreement allegedly made in February 1998 on the recapitalization of BanCrecer, and in particular that US$ 25 million of the Dollar Debentures would be returned if no foreign strategic partner could be found (*see* \u00b6\u00b6 66-67 above). Dr. Reuss wrote:\n\n[N]os permitimos dirigirnos a Ustedes con referencia al proceso para la futura venta o fusi\u00f3n de BanCrecer.\n\nComo Ustedes est\u00e1n enterados, el Grupo Allianz suscribi\u00f3 en Octubre de 1996 una emisi\u00f3n de obligaciones de BanCrecer, denominados en D\u00f3lares, por valor de US D\u00f3lares 50 millones. Al mismo tiempo, BanCrecer hizo una emisi\u00f3n de obligaciones en pesos, por un monto equivalente, suscrita por tenedores mexicanos. Esta emisi\u00f3n de obligaciones suscrita por inversionistas nacionales fue totalmente liquidada por BanCrecer en 1998, con la aprobaci\u00f3n de todas las autoridades financieras competentes.\n\nEn el caso de Allianz, hab\u00edamos ofrecido a las autoridades en Febrero de 1998 el volver a invertir la totalidad de los mencionados US D\u00f3lares 50 millones en obligaciones, una vez liquidados, mas inversiones adicionales de otros US D\u00f3lares 50 millones, en un plan de recapitalizaci\u00f3n de BanCrecer en conjunto con un socio bancario extranjero, programa que hab\u00eda sido aprobad[o] por la Junta de Gobierno de FOBAPROA en el primer trimestre 1998.\n\nEn la consideraci\u00f3n original por parte de las autoridades del plan de recapitalizaci\u00f3n de BanCrecer, tambi\u00e9n hab\u00edamos aceptado el que solamente se liquidar\u00eda a Allianz un monto de US D\u00f3lares 25 millones en caso de que el plan de recapitalizaci\u00f3n no pudiese llevarse a cabo por falta de socios extranjeros interesados.\n\nPor los retrasos lamentables y ataques pol\u00edticos que sufrieron los programas pendientes de FOBAPROA, la Junta de Gobierno del FOBAPROA nunca lleg\u00f3 a entregar a BanCrecer o a J.P. Morgan, los agentes financieros de BanCrecer, una carta formal de intenciones, firmada por el FOBAPROA y cuyos t\u00e9rminos ya se hab\u00edan redactado. Esta carta de intenciones, tantas veces solicitada, era la base fundamental para que los bancos que en aquel tiempo estuvieron interesados en adquirir o recapitalizar a BanCrecer, pudiesen concretizar sus intenciones de inversi\u00f3n, ya que, evidentemente, los t\u00e9rminos de participaci\u00f3n del FOBAPROA y su acuerdo al plan de recapitalizaci\u00f3n eran condiciones imprescindibles para cualquier entrada de un socio bancario extranjero.\n\nActualmente, con la inminente formaci\u00f3n del IPAB y con la intenci\u00f3n de someter el caso de BanCrecer a un proceso de licitaci\u00f3n, la venta o fusi\u00f3n de BanCrecer posiblemente se afectar\u00eda dentro de un corto plazo.\n\nEs por este raz\u00f3n que Allianz quisiera respetuosamente volver a plantear el tema de las obligaciones para solicitar se liquiden las obligaciones, como parte del programa de reestructuraci\u00f3n de BanCrecer, tal como se procedi\u00f3 hacer para el caso de las obligaciones en posesi\u00f3n de tenedores nacionales.\n\nConfirmamos, en este contexto, nuestro compromiso, una vez liquidadas las obligaciones suscritas por el Grupo Allianz, de volver a invertir, dentro del capital de la instituci\u00f3n absorbente de BanCrecer, con el fin de fortalecer su posici\u00f3n financiera, la totalidad de los US D\u00f3lares 50 millones de obligaciones liquidadas. Claro est\u00e1 que tal re-inversi\u00f3n por parte de Allianz, as\u00ed como el compromiso de Allianz para inversiones adicionales, depender\u00edan de si una inversi\u00f3n de Allianz ser\u00eda bienvenida por la instituci\u00f3n absorbente y se otorgue en condiciones aceptables, y si la instituci\u00f3n absorbente quisiera llegar a acuerdos satisfactorios para el Grupo Allianz en cuanto a una continuaci\u00f3n de la colaboraci\u00f3n en el sector de banca-seguros.\n\n[Translation:\n\n[W]e take the liberty of addressing you in reference to the process for the future sale or merger of BanCrecer.\n\nAs you are aware, in October of 1996 the Allianz Group subscribed to an issuance of dollar-denominated debentures by BanCrecer, for a value of US Dollars 50 million. At the same time, BanCrecer carried out the issuance of peso-denominated debentures, for an equal amount, which was acquired by Mexican holders. That issuance of debentures, acquired by Mexican holders, was liquidated in its entirety by BanCrecer in 1998, with the approval of all the competent financial authorities.\n\nIn the case of Allianz, in February of 1998 we offered to the authorities that we would reinvest the entire afore-mentioned US Dollar 50 million debentures, once they were liquidated, plus an additional investment of US Dollar 50 million, in a recapitalization plan for BanCrecer, jointly with a foreign banking partner, the program which had been approved by the Governing Board of FOBAPROA, in the first quarter of 1998.\n\nIn the original consideration by the authorities of the recapitalization plan of BanCrecer, we had also accepted that only an amount equal to US Dollar 25 million was to be liquidated with respect to Allianz, in case the recapitalization plan could not be carried out by the lack of interested foreign partners.\n\nGiven the regrettable delays and political attacks suffered by the pending FOBAPROA programs, the Governing Board of FOBAPROA was never able to deliver, either to BanCrecer or to JPMorgan, the financial agents of BanCrecer, a formal letter of intent signed by FOBAPROA whose terms had already been drafted. This letter of intent, so many times requested, was the fundamental basis on which the banks that at that time were interested in acquiring or recapitalizing BanCrecer, would have been able to realize their investment intentions, given that, evidently, the terms of participation of FOBAPROA and its agreement to the recapitalization plan were essential conditions to the entry of any foreign banking partner.\n\nCurrently, with the imminent creation of IPAB and with the intention of submitting the BanCrecer case to a public bidding process, the sale or merger of BanCrecer possibly would be effected within a brief period.\n\nIt is for this reason that Allianz, respectfully, would like to revert to the issue of the debentures, in order to request their payment as part of the restructuring program of BanCrecer, just as it was carried out in the case of the debentures in possession of the national holders.\n\nIn this context, we confirm our commitment to re-invest in the equity of the entity absorbing BanCrecer the entire 50 million US Dollars, with the objective of strengthening its financial position, once the debentures acquired by the Allianz Group are liquidated. It is clear that such re-investment by Allianz as well as the commitment by Allianz for additional investments, would depend on whether an investment by Allianz would be welcomed by the absorbing entity and be granted on acceptable conditions, and whether the absorbing entity would be willing to reach agreements satisfactory to Allianz Group, regarding a continuity in the collaboration within the banking-insurance sector.]\n\nExh.

The legal opinion dated 23 June 1999 from Bufete Carrillo Gamboa, S.C. concludes that FOBAPROA's letter of 11 November 1998,51 by which it returned the entire portfolio the BanCrecer (and BanOro), was \"of questionable legality since it stems from unilateral conduct.\"52 The legal opinion was based on a number of assumptions, in particular the proper fulfilment by BanCrecer, BanOro and the shareholders of the obligations undertaken in the various agreements.

Although the opinion was mentioned on his disclosure statement in the present case at the time of his appointment in May 2002, Mr. Francisco Carrillo Gamboa resigned as arbitrator in March 2005 when it became apparent that FFIC relied on this opinion in the merits phase of the arbitration. *See* \u00b6 27 *supra.*\n\n86.\n\nOn 7 July 1999, FFIC requested GFB to seek permission from Banco de M\u00e9xico for it to acquire the Dollar Debentures on the same terms as the Peso Debentures had been \"repurchased.\"53 GFB sought the permission at Banco de M\u00e9xico by letter of 16 July 1999, to which it attached FFIC's letter of 7 July 1999.54 On 16 August 1999, Banco de M\u00e9xico denied GFB's request, asserting that \"anticipated payment\" of convertible debentures is not allowed under Mexican law.55\n\nExh.

It addresses the establishment of a trust with the knowledge of the Mexican financial authorities to acquire in the market the peso-denominated debentures, with the object of re-issuing them once the capitalization plan materialized. It also refers to the recapitalization plan that was submitted for consideration of FOBAPROA's Technical Committee at its 27 February 1998 meeting. According to such recapitalization plan, the debentures acquired by the Allianz Group would be considered as part of the investment it would make in BanCrecer, to be supplemented with an additional USD 50 million and, in the event that it would not be possible to conclude the capitalization plan on account of the foreign interested partners, Allianz would be reimbursed a sum of USD 25 million.*\n\n*\u2022 It addresses Allianz' complaint to the financial authorities, and its request that it be reimbursed for the totality of its investment in convertible debentures issued by BanCrecer, asking for the same treatment as the national holders of the peso denominated debentures that had been liquidated. It notes that the Allianz Group has made reference to their rights under investment treaties.*\n\n*\u2022 It discusses the Allianz Group's willingness to negotiate and the risks of litigation as well as the ability to attract potential foreign investors when it becomes known that unequal treatment of a foreign investor was intended. At FOBAPROA's Technical Committee meeting on 27 February 1998, those present decided to negotiate with Allianz and the group of shareholders which control GFB, on terms that would avoid disputes brought up by the debenture holders.*\n\n*\u2022 In conclusion, the CNBV recommended to negotiate with the Allianz Group.***]**\n\n**[***REDACTED***]**\n\n**[***REDACTED***]**\n\n**[***REDACTED***]**\n\n**[***REDACTED***]**\n\n**[***REDACTED***]**\n\n88.\n\n**[***REDACTED***]**\n\n89.\n\nOn 14 September 1999, by letters addressed to the Banco de M\u00e9xico and CNBV,58 GFB attempted to convert the Dollar Debentures (and Peso Debentures) into shares of GFB prior to the maturity date, 12 October 2000. FFIC asserts that this attempt was made at the instigation of IBAP.59 On 4 October 1999, FFIC was able to obtain a court injunction (*amparo*) to block the anticipatory conversion.60 By letter of 12 October 1999, Banco de M\u00e9xico denied GFB authorization to convert the Dollar Debentures prematurely.61 By a decision dated 10 November 1999,62 the Federal Mexican Court dismissed the *amparo* proceeding initiated by FFIC against actions by Banco de M\u00e9xico, the CNBV and other authorities, in connection with the delivery of an alleged authorization for the anticipated conversion of the Debentures issued by GFB.

OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe following two Sections provide an overview of the numerous factual and legal arguments of FFIC and Mexico as made in their written and oral submissions. The Tribunal will consider them in more detail, and to the extent relevant those made at the hearing, in the various Sections of Chapter VII below.\n\n**A. FFIC**\n-----------\n\n103.\n\nIn support of its claim, FFIC asserts that expropriation under NAFTA includes deprivation of the use or value of a covered investment.77 FFIC further asserts that Mexico permanently deprived it of the use and value of its investment and thereby expropriated it within the meaning of Article 1110 of the NAFTA, as informed by international law authorities and precedent, by the following:\n\n(i) In early 1998, the Government of Mexico compelled FFIC to use its investment to further the Government's Recapitalization Plan for BanCrecer.78\n\n(ii) After compelling FFIC to participate in the Government's Recapitalization Plan, the Government proceeded to thwart the Program to which it had committed itself, thereby depriving FFIC of the value of its investment as envisioned under the Program.79\n\n(iii) At or around the same time that the Government approved and then subsequently failed to carry out the Recapitalization Plan for BanCrecer, the Government discriminated against FFIC by refusing to authorize the repurchase of FFIC's Dollar Debentures at face value, as the Government had done for the Mexican investors of the Peso Debentures.80\n\n(iv) The Government of Mexico also deprived FFIC of the value of its investment by returning, in November 1998, the non-performing loan portfolios assumed by FOBAPROA from 1995-1997.81\n\n(v) The Government of Mexico, through IBAP, took the ultimate step to deprive FFIC of the value of its investment by taking control of BanCrecer in November 1999.82\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 86-96\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 98-99. At the hearing, FFIC asserted that the alleged expropriation occurred in November 1997 (Transcript of the hearing 1117:8-9).\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6100-104.\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 105-119.\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 120-122.\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6 123.\n\n104.\n\nFFIC adds that the deprivation of the use and value of its investment is not merely \"ephemeral.\"83\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6 124.\n\n105.\n\nFFIC also contends that even if the Tribunal were to find that no single one of the Government's actions individually is sufficient to support a finding of expropriation, it is clear that the totality of the acts and omissions of the Government, considered cumulatively, had the effect of depriving FFIC of the use and value of its investment, thereby expropriating it.84\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 126-129.\n\n106.\n\nFinally, FFIC asserts that it did not receive fair market value for its investment in violation of Article 1110 of the NAFTA.85\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6 130.\n\n107.\n\nIn its Memorial on the Merits, FFIC also alleges that it is entitled to the full value of its investment, being US$ 50 million, on which compound interest should be awarded.86 In its Reply on the Merits, FFIC limited itself to observing that it would present its full argument on damages when the parties reach the third phase of these proceedings.87\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 130-138.\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6 115.\n\n108.\n\nIn its Reply on the Merits, FFIC first asserts that Mexico mischaracterizes or ignores key facts regarding its expropriation of its investment. According to FFIC, these include: (a) the role of the Working Group;88 (b) the Peso Debentures Repurchase;89 (c) the Recapitalization Program;90 (d) FFIC's request for repurchase;91 (e) FFIC's participation in the Recapitalization Program;92 and (f) Mexico's destruction of the Recapitalization Program: failure to sign the Memorandum of Intent and unilateral return of the entire loan portfolio.93\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 4-8.\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 9-17.\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 18-24.\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 25-35.\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 36-41.\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 42-53.\n\n109.\n\nFFIC also contends that the Tribunal has competence to hear all facts and legal arguments pertaining to FFIC's expropriation claim.94\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 54-62.\n\n110.\n\nFFIC denies that the measures that form the basis of FFIC's expropriation claim are covered by the prudential measures exception.95\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 63-93.\n\n111.\n\nFinally, FFIC asserts that its expropriation claim falls within the core norms of expropriation prohibited under Article 1110 of the NAFTA.96\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 94-114.\n\n112.\n\nIn its Supplemental Submission of 21 September 2005, FFIC submits that: (a) the Working Group is a State organ under international law; (b) that Mexico directed and controlled the Working Group and that, in any event, its actions are attributable to Mexico; and (c) that the Government of Mexico acknowledged and adopted the acts of the Working Group.97\n\nClaimant's Supplemental Submission \u00b6\u00b6 7-17.\n\n113.\n\nIn the Supplemental Submission, FFIC addresses again the Recapitalization Plan in rebuttal of Mexico's defenses and in reliance on what FFIC describes as \"new testimony.\"98\n\nClaimant's Supplemental Submission \u00b6\u00b6 18-24.\n\n114.\n\nFFIC also addresses again the return by FOBAPROA of the loan portfolio to BanCrecer, arguing, *inter alia*, that the unilateral return by the Government made it impossible to pursue the Recapitalization Plan.99\n\nClaimant's Supplemental Submission \u00b6\u00b6 25-32.\n\n115.\n\nFinally, in the Supplemental Submission, FFIC responds to the *dictamen* of SHCP of 3 August 2005, produced by Mexico in conjunction with its Rejoinder on the Merits.100 FFIC summarizes the *dictamen* \"that all of the Government activities in its various bank rescue efforts during Mexico's financial crisis were directed to prudential ends.\" FFIC contends that: \"What is relevant here, however, is whether the Government's specific measures with respect to Fireman's Fund's investment in GFB were \u2018reasonable prudential measures.\"101\n\nExh. R2934-2947.\n\nClaimant's Supplemental Submission \u00b6\u00b6 33-38.\n\n**B. Mexico**\n-------------\n\n116.\n\nMexico emphasizes that, while being a sophisticated investor, FFIC made a risky investment in a bank at a time that there was a very serious financial crisis in Mexico.102\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6 5.\n\n117.\n\nMexico addresses and partially disputes a number of the facts as alleged by FFIC, including those relating to:103 (a) the financial rescue;104 (b) the deteriorating financial situation of BanCrecer and GFB between 1994 and 1999;105 (c) the programs implemented by FOBAPROA;106 (d) the participation by GFB and BanCrecer in the PCCC;107 (e) the *Ley de Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro Bancario* [Law for the Protection of Bank Savings];108 (f) the Debentures;109 and (g) the premature conversion of the Debentures by GFB.110\n\n*See also* Annex 2 to Counter-Memorial on the Merits (\"Admissions and Denials of the Government of Mexico with respect to Claimant's Memorial\").\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 47-58.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 59-77.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 78-112.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 113-148.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 149-168.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 169-192.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 193-196.\n\n118.\n\nWith respect to the legal arguments, Mexico contends that FFIC makes three fundamental errors in its reasoning as presented in the Memorial on the Merits:\n\n(a) First, in that it presents an inadmissible claim for denial of national treatment, disguised as a claim for expropriation.\n\n(b) Second, in that it attempts to prove an expropriation on the basis of an analysis of alleged violations of the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of Article 1110, instead of establishing that there was an expropriation and then proceeding to an analysis of the fulfilment of those requirements.\n\n(c) Third, in that it extends the concept of expropriation much beyond any concept recognized until now as an expropriation under international law.111\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6 197.\n\n119.\n\nMexico further raises a number of questions relating to the competence of the Tribunal: (1) jurisdictional limits;112 (2) the claim is based on facts and arguments that are outside the competence of the Tribunal;113 (3) the United States has considered bringing a State-to-State claim under Chapter Twenty of the NAFTA;114 and (4) the Tribunal must ignore large portions of the Memorial on the Merits.115\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 198-210.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 211-215.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 216-217.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 218-222.\n\n120.\n\nWith respect to the merits of FFIC's claim, Mexico contends that the challenged measures concern prudential measures authorized by Chapter Fourteen of the NAFTA, in particular Article 1410.116\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 223-232.\n\n121.\n\nMexico further contends that FFIC gives an incorrect interpretation of Article 1110 of the NAFTA, which, moreover, is dangerous, extensive and without precedent.117\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 233-286.\n\n122.\n\nMexico concludes that the application of the law to the facts of the present case shows that there was no expropriation.118\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 287-293.\n\n123.\n\nWith respect to FFIC's request for damages, as set forth in FFIC's Memorial on the Merits, Mexico points out that, in the present phase of the arbitration, the Tribunal is not to deal with damages since the proceedings were bifurcated.119\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 294-315. *See also* Rejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 275-278.\n\n124.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on the Merits, Mexico first disputes a number of factual allegations made by FFIC in its Reply on the Merits: (a) the Working Group;120 (b) the \"temporal acquisition\" of the Peso Debentures;121 (c) the Recapitalization Program;122 (d) the proposal to liquidate the Dollar Debentures;123 and (e) the return of the loan portfolio.124\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 16-31.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 32-60.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 61-121.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 122-131.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 132-158.\n\n125.\n\nMexico also maintains that Article 1410 of the NAFTA (Exceptions relating to prudential measures) covers the measures in question relating to the claim.125\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 159-176.\n\n126.\n\nMexico further contends that FFIC did not respond to two central arguments in Mexico's Counter-Memorial on the Merits: (1) Mexico's objection that FFIC is in reality a claim for violation of Article 1405 of the NAFTA (National Treatment); and (2) FFIC ignores that both the United States and Mexico coincide in that there is error in interpreting the NAFTA if an expropriation is shown on the basis of the criteria set forth in paragraphs (a) through (d) of Article 1110 for the purposes of determining whether an expropriation took place legally.126\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6 177.\n\n127.\n\nMexico also voices other criticisms on FFIC's Reply on the Merits, including FFIC's response to allegations that Mexico never made; FFIC's contentions regarding creeping expropriation; and the use of State funds as a concession *ex gratia*. Further, Mexico asserts that BanCrecer never complied with **[***REDACTED***]** ; that FFIC's investment had practically no value in February 1998; that FFIC voluntarily acquired the Dollar Debentures as part of the PCCC; that there was no willing buyer of the Dollar Debentures in 1998; that the Government did not \"repudiate\" its \"agreement\" by returning the loan portfolio in November 1998; that the Memorandum of Intent of May 1998 was merely a draft; and that it is a factual and legal question whether FFIC held an investment in an insolvent bank and had an acquired right for demanding a rescue by the Government.127\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 178-197.\n\n128.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on the Merits, Mexico reiterates that the Tribunal has no competence to address a claim for denial of National Treatment.128\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 202-231.\n\n129.\n\nMexico further argues that the Tribunal has no competence to determine whether acts of the Mexican financial authorities were \"inappropriate.\"129\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 232-238.\n\n130.\n\nMexico also contends that the Tribunal does not have competence over questions of internal law.130\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 239-253.\n\n131.\n\nWith respect to FFIC's contentions regarding the Working Group, Mexico submits that the Working Group cannot create acquired rights.131\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 255-259.\n\n132.\n\nFinally, with respect to FFIC's allegations concerning discrimination, without prejudice to its position that FFIC's claim is a disguised claim for denial of national treatment, Mexico contends that no discrimination occurred in regard of FFIC.132\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 260-274.\n\n133.\n\nIn its Pre-hearing brief of 21 September 2005, Mexico submitted that its arguments in its Rejoinder on the Merits responded to FFIC's arguments in its Reply on the Merits.\n\n**VII. CONSIDERATION BY THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered all written and oral submissions of the parties and the written and oral evidence produced by them as well as the submission of the Government of Canada in the present phase of the proceedings. Every question submitted to the Tribunal is expressly or implicitly addressed below.\n\n135.\n\nIn addressing the questions below, the Tribunal will adhere to the principle set forth by Article 1131(1) of the NAFTA according to which \"A Tribunal established under this Section shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable rules of international law.\"\n\n136.\n\nWhen interpreting the NAFTA, the Tribunal will follow the rules of interpretation set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 1969. Accordingly, the text of the NAFTA is in the first place to be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. Recourse can be had to supplementary rules of interpretation under the conditions stated in Article 32 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n**B. Observations as to Competence133**\n---------------------------------------\n\nIn the present Award, the Tribunal uses the terms \"competence\" and \"jurisdiction\" as equivalent legal concepts. It is to be noted that the NAFTA refers to \"jurisdiction\" (*see*, *e.g.*, Article 1126(2)); 1126(8)) and the Additional Facility Rules to \"competence\" (Article 46).\n\n137.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, Mexico raises four points under the heading \" *Cuestiones de competencia.* \"134\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 198-222.\n\n138.\n\nThe *first point* relates to the position of Allianz AG, the ultimate parent company of FFIC and incorporated under the laws of Germany.135 According to Mexico, while FFIC is an investor within the meaning of the NAFTA, a distinction should be made between the acts of FFIC and those of Allianz AG. Allianz AG concluded with GFB **[** *a memorandum of intent to form a company in Mexico.***]** Allianz of America, Inc. in turn concluded with GFB **[** *an agreement.***]** That agreement contemplates **[** *the setting up of a joint venture in Mexico.***]** In this manner, Mexico argues, the two principal parties are GFB and Allianz. Mexico adds that Dr. Reuss represented Allianz during the period 1995-1999 and that no document shows that he ever received instructions from FFIC. Mexico submits that FFIC cannot include claims on behalf of Allianz AG on the basis of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between FR Germany and Mexico of 25 August 1998.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 198-209.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that FFIC does not dispute the fact that it cannot present claims of Allianz AG under the German-Mexican BIT in the present arbitration. However, FFIC has not made such a claim and FFIC's claim in the present arbitration is based on Article 1110 of the NAFTA concerning expropriation. Mexico expressly recognizes that FFIC is entitled to bring the latter claim.138 The Tribunal's mandate is indeed only concerned with that claim. The point raised by Mexico, therefore, need not be addressed further.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6 210.\n\n140.\n\nWith respect to Dr. Reuss' authority to act on behalf of FFIC, FFIC points out that he used \"Allianz\" as a shorthand for the Allianz Group of which FFIC forms part and that it was clear that he acted for FFIC in the matters relevant to the present case.139 A review of the record indeed confirms that Mexico could not reasonably have understood Dr. Reuss' authority differently.\n\nReuss III \u00b6 4.\n\n141.\n\nThe *second point* is Mexico's submission that FFIC's claim is based on facts and arguments that are outside the competence of the Tribunal.140 Mexico contends that at the hearing concerning the Preliminary Question, FFIC recognized that its claims were mainly concerned with a violation of the obligation of national treatment and not expropriation, but that its claim in the present phase of the arbitration is a resuscitation of its claim alleging denial of national treatment, in particular in respect of allegations of discriminatory treatment. This is denied by FFIC.141\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 211-215.\n\nTranscript of the hearing 1283-84.\n\n142.\n\nIt is indeed the case that, at the hearing on the Preliminary Question, FFIC focussed on the alleged violation of the obligation of national treatment and not on expropriation. However, at that hearing, FFIC did not abandon in any manner its claim based on alleged expropriation.\n\n143.\n\nMore generally, the Tribunal wishes to recall that its competence in the present phase of the arbitration is solely concerned with FFIC's claim under Article 1110 of the NAFTA. As the Tribunal ruled in its Decision on the Preliminary Question of 17 July 2003:\n\n66. Several provisions of Chapter Eleven are incorporated into Chapter Fourteen, including, as here relevant, Article 1110 concerning Expropriation and Compensation, and Articles 11151138 concerning the procedural aspects of dispute resolution by a tribunal such as the present one. Article 1102 on National Treatment and Article 1105 on Minimum Standard of Treatment are not incorporated into Chapter Fourteen. Accordingly, if the measures alleged to have been taken on behalf of the Government of Mexico are covered by Chapter Fourteen, this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction of the claims under Articles 1102 and 1105. Chapter Fourteen contains no counterpart to the Minimum Standard of Treatment provision of Chapter Eleven; it does contain, in Article 1405, a counterpart to the national treatment provision in Chapter Eleven, and indeed a claim for breach of Article 1405 is made in the present arbitration. However, Article 1405 is not included among the provisions to which the procedural provisions of Chapter Eleven apply (Articles 1115-1138), and Article 1414 makes clear that claims under Article 1405 are subject to state-to-state dispute settlement pursuant to Chapter Twenty, not to investor-state dispute settlement under Chapter Eleven.\n\n67. In sum, if the measures challenged in this arbitration are covered by Chapter Fourteen, the claims brought under Articles 1102, 1105, and 1405 must be dismissed, and only the claim for expropriation pursuant to Article 1110 remains to be decided by this Tribunal. If, on the other hand, the conditions for application of Chapter Fourteen are not met, the claims under Article 1102 (National Treatment) and Article 1105 (Minimum Standards of Treatment) remain before this Tribunal, along with the expropriation claim under Article 1110.\n\n(....)\n\n112... (1) HOLDS that Claimant's claims brought under Articles 1102, 1105 and 1405 of the NAFTA are not within the competence of the Tribunal, but that claims brought under Article 1110 are within its competence;\n\n144.\n\nThe *third point* is that, according to Mexico, the United States is considering bringing a claim against Mexico under Chapter Twenty of the NAFTA, including a possible claim based on Article 1405 (National Treatment).142 Mexico contends that, although the present Tribunal has already rejected (*desechado*) a claim based on Article 1405, it cannot put at risk its legal position in that respect.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 216-217, and Exh. R1882, containing a letter by Ambassador Robert B. Zoellick to Secretary Fernando Canales Clariond of 28 June 2004 **.**\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of Mexico's observation. However, it needs to be made clear that, in the Decision on the Preliminary Question of 17 July 2003, the present Tribunal did not \"reject\" a claim based on Article 1405 of the NAFTA, as stated by Mexico, but only held that FFIC's claims brought under Article 1405 (as well as under Articles 1102 and 1105) are not within the competence of the present Tribunal.\n\n146.\n\nThe *fourth point* is Mexico's contention that the Tribunal should ignore substantial parts of FFIC's Memorial.143 The parts to be ignored concern, according to Mexico, those related to a treatment that is less favourable to FFIC than to the Pesos Debentures and discrimination as they are in fact a National Treatment claim. This is denied by FFIC.144\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 218-222; *see also* Rejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 198-254.\n\nReply on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 54-62.\n\n147.\n\nAs previously stated, the Tribunal is well aware of its limited competence under Chapter Fourteen, and it makes no determination concerning claims based on alleged failure to accord national treatment to FFIC. However, the Tribunal notes that FFIC makes those allegations in connection with its effort to establish expropriation within the meaning of Article 1110, which are within the competence of the Tribunal. *See* \u00b6 143 above.\n\n**C. Working Group**\n--------------------\n\n148.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal will examine the nature of the Working Group and the question whether acts of the Working Group can be attributed to the Mexican State.\n\n149.\n\nOne of the claims made in the arbitration on behalf of FFIC was based on the negotiation, development, and ultimate rejection of a Recapitalization Program of BanCrecer by the so-called Working Group (*Grupo de Trabajo*). Mexico did not deny the existence of the Working Group, but took the position that no legal claims could be based on its activities, because under Mexican law the Working Group was not a governmental organization with decision-making authority or power to bind the State.145 FFIC replied, in essence, that regardless of its internal administrative law, Mexico could not, under international law, avoid responsibility for the conduct of a body that acts on its behalf vis-\u00e0-vis third parties such as FFIC.146\n\nRejoinder on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 255-259.\n\nClaimant's Supplemental Submission \u00b6\u00b6 7-11.\n\n150.\n\nPut in this abstract form, FFIC's statement is correct. However, the evidence submitted to the Tribunal does not show a case of a commitment made on behalf of Mexico by the Working Group and subsequently repudiated by the State. Rather, the Working Group was a forum in which proposals of various kinds were discussed among the relevant Mexican agencies and with interested outside parties, subject at all times to ratification or rejection by the competent government authorities.\n\n151.\n\nThe evidence before the Tribunal, principally from Dr. Reuss on behalf of FFIC and Dra. Armend\u00e1riz Guerra on behalf of Mexico, showed clearly that - like other working groups established to coordinate the search for solutions for financial institutions caught in the Mexican financial crisis - the Working Group for BanCrecer consisted of representatives of the principal agencies of government with responsibilities in the financial sector - the Banco de M\u00e9xico, the Ministry of Finance (*Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito Publ\u00edco*), the National Banking and Securities Commission (*Comisi\u00f3n Nacional Bancaria y de Valores* or CNBV), and the Fund for Protection of Bank Savings (*Fondo Bancario de Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro* or FOBAPROA), later replaced by the Institute for the Protection of Bank Savings (*Instituto para la Protecci\u00f3n al Ahorro Bancario* or IPAB). The Working Group concerned with the situation of BanCrecer met frequently, usually with the respective agencies represented by senior civil servants, such as Dra. Armend\u00e1riz Guerra on behalf of CNBV. Though no fixed schedule of meetings was in effect and no formal minutes were kept, the BanCrecer Working Group was clearly a body that interested parties, including the creditors and shareholders of BanCrecer and GFB, had to communicate and reckon with. Correspondingly, approaches by such parties, including FFIC, to individual agencies were often met with the response that the matter in question would have to be considered by the Working Group.\n\n152.\n\nAs the Tribunal views the considerable evidence on the function of the Working Group, no major decision - whether acceptance of a given Recapitalization Plan, approval of the issuance of new securities by GFB, rejection or postponement of a Recapitalization Plan, assumption of BanCrecer's loan portfolio by FOBAPROA, or return of the loan portfolio to BanCrecer - would be taken without substantial consensus within the Working Group and (where appropriate) its Technical Committee. If the Working Group rejected a proposal, or agreement to adopt it could not be reached within the Working Group, the proposal would go no further, regardless of whether the proposal had originated in one of the Working Group's constituent agencies or had been submitted by an outside party such as FFIC or BanCrecer. No formal resolution was required to reach that result. If, on the other hand, the Working Group endorsed a given plan or proposal, it was up to the relevant agency or agencies that would have responsibility for carrying out the plan or proposal or issuing the required permit or license to give its (or their) approval at the level of Governor (for the Banco de M\u00e9xico), Minister (for Hacienda), Director General (for FOBAPROA) or President (for CNBV). It is clear to the Tribunal that the representatives of FFIC, in particular Dr. Reuss, understood this process.147\n\n*See, e.g.,* letter from Dr. Reuss to Mr. Hansmeyer of 26 February 1998, Exh. C1178-1179=R2533-2534.\n\n153.\n\nIt is certainly credible, in the estimation of the Tribunal, that FFIC and JP Morgan believed that the Government of Mexico and all the relevant agencies would approve a Recapitalization Plan discussed in the Working Group and advised to representatives of BanCrecer and FFIC on 26 February 1998.148 Evidently JP Morgan, acting for or in cooperation with FFIC, also believed this, and accordingly issued a Press Release on 27 February 1998 jointly with GFB, announcing approval of the Plan.149 But no document was produced in the arbitration purporting to be approval of the Recapitalization Plan, whether by the Working Group or by its member agencies on recommendation of the Working Group. It appears to the Tribunal that one or more of the principals did not agree with the recommendation of the Working Group, or at least wanted to postpone the decision. The Tribunal concludes that the outsiders who had been negotiating with the Working Group on behalf of BanCrecer, FFIC, and JP Morgan should have known and did know that while the recommendations of the Working Group were crucial to approval of any recapitalization or reorganization, they were recommendations, not actions and by definition not final. Indeed negotiations over various documents related to the proposal continued for several months after issuance of the Press Release, suggesting that both the government representatives and the representatives of the private parties regarded the process as incomplete. While the reluctance of Mr. Fern\u00e1ndez Garc\u00eda, the President of CNBV, either to publicly endorse or to repudiate the press release is equivocal,150 it cannot, in the view of the Tribunal, be regarded as an undertaking to be imputed to the State, the breach of which gives rise to a legal claim.\n\n*See* Reuss II \u00b6 11; Transcript of the hearing 392-400.\n\nThe representative of JP Morgan, Mr. Eduardo Cepeda Fern\u00e1ndez, submitted an Affidavit stating that the press release would not have been issued \"if we had not had the full assurance that the Mexican government had, in fact, approved the recapitalization of BanCrecer on the terms stated in the release.\" (*See* Cepeda Fern\u00e1ndez II \u00b6 7). Unfortunately, Mr. Cepeda did not testify at the hearing. While the thrust of Mr. Cepeda's statement that JP Morgan would not have issued the press release on 27 February 1998 without assurance from the Government is credible, without the possibility of cross-examination about the scope of the alleged assurance and the context in which it was given, the Tribunal could not give credence to Mr. Cepeda's statement, which was inconsistent with the evidence of Dra. Armend\u00e1riz Guerra (Second Declaration \u00b6\u00b6 45-50.)\n\n*See* testimony of Dra. Armend\u00e1riz Guerra, Transcript of the hearing 892-899.\n\n154.\n\nIf FFIC and those consulting or collaborating with it, such as JP Morgan, placed more reliance on informal recommendations not officially communicated than was justified, the consequence cannot, in the view of the Tribunal, be attributed to the Working Group and through it to the State.\n\n155.\n\nIn conclusion, putting aside the question whether rejection of the Recapitalization Plan of February 1998 could be regarded as an expropriation or element of expropriation within the meaning of Article 1110 of the NAFTA - see Section E below - the relations of the Working Group with Claimant do not give rise to liability on the part of the Government of Mexico under the NAFTA.\n\n**D. Prudential Measures**\n--------------------------\n\n156.\n\nMexico contends that the measures in question are \"reasonable measures for prudential reasons\" within the meaning of Article 1410 (Exceptions) of the NAFTA. FFIC denies that the measures fall under Article 1410, and submits that, in any event, the measures were not \"reasonable.\"\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that since the present arbitration is the first case brought under the Financial Services Chapter of the NAFTA, this is the first occasion for an international tribunal to set forth its interpretation of Article 1410(1).\n\n158.\n\nArticle 1410(1) (Exceptions) of the NAFTA provides:\n\n1. Nothing in this Part [Five, i.e., \"Investment, Services and Related Matters\"] shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting or maintaining reasonable measures for prudential reasons, such as:\n\n(a) the protection of investors, depositors, financial market participants, policyholders, policy claimants, or persons to whom a fiduciary duty is owed by a financial institution or cross-border financial service provider;\n\n(b) the maintenance of the safety, soundness, integrity or financial responsibility of financial institutions or cross-border financial service providers; and\n\n(c) ensuring the integrity and stability of a Party's financial system.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal notes, first, that the Article is entitled \"Exceptions,\" that is, it provides that a measure otherwise prohibited under \"this Part\" (i.e., including Chapter Eleven and Chapter Fourteen) will not constitute a violation of the NAFTA if it qualifies as a \"reasonable measure taken for prudential reasons.\"\n\n160.\n\nClaimant argued that if a measure adopted or maintained by Respondent is found not to be reasonable or taken for prudential reasons, it would give rise to liability, or at least to a presumption of liability, under Article 1110. The Tribunal rejects this contention. As the Tribunal understands Article 1410 within the anatomy of the NAFTA, a judgment as to whether the exception applies is called for only after an initial, at least tentative, conclusion that Article 1110 or another applicable provision of the NAFTA may have been violated.\n\n161.\n\nClaimant argued that if a measure is discriminatory, it cannot be regarded as reasonable, and therefore gives rise to liability under the NAFTA. Respondent contended that Claimant misreads Article 1410, in an attempt to bring before the Tribunal a claim for discrimination under Chapter Fourteen, when such claims are expressly excluded.\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal, noting that the exception applies to all provisions of Part Five (\"Investments, Services and Related Matters\") of the NAFTA applicable to Financial Services, including the National Treatment article (Article 1405), concludes that Article 1410(1) permits reasonable measures of a prudential character even if their *effect* (as contrasted with their motive or intent) is discriminatory. The Tribunal rejects the contention that a measure discriminatory in effect is *eo ipso* unreasonable.\n\n163.\n\nIn his book on the Financial Services Chapter of the NAFTA, Olin L. Wethington, the principal negotiator of that Chapter on behalf of the United States of America, writes:\n\nArticle 1410(1)(a)... carves out of the national treatment and other obligations of the financial services chapter a right to take reasonable measures even though discriminatory in application, to protect the safety and soundness of the financial system. This regulatory prerogative to protect the integrity of the financial system is accepted internationally.151\n\nOlin L Wethington, FINANCIAL MARKET LIBERALIZATION, at \u00a7 5.07 (Sheppard's McGraw Hill 1994).\n\n164.\n\nThe author goes on to point out that the prudential exception covers only \"reasonable\" measures, such as measures relating to capital adequacy, loan loss reserve requirements, cash reserve and liquidity requirements and various regulations pertaining to diversification of risk. However, evidently focusing on Mexico, he writes:\n\nHowever, the exception cannot be used as a guise or an indirect means for discriminating against United States or Canadian entities or for taking arbitrary action in connection with individual firm applications or approval or licensing requests. It does not constitute an exception which permits backhanded avoidance of the national treatment and other significant obligations in the financial services chapter.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts this exposition of Article 1410(1). It does not, in the context of the present case, believe that it is called upon to determine whether the challenged measures, even if they fell unevenly on Claimant, were reasonable or arbitrary, since the condition precedent for invocation of the Prudential Measures Exception, a finding of expropriation, has not been fulfilled as it will be seen later in this Award.\n\n166.\n\nThe question was also raised, though not pressed by Respondent, whether Article 1410(1) is a self-judging provision. The Tribunal rejects this suggestion. The Tribunal is clear that Article 1410(1) makes available to a State-Party an affirmative defense to be established before an impartial panel or committee.\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 1415 of the NAFTA makes special provision for decision of a defense under Article 1410 by the Financial Services Committee (i.e., by government officials of the three Parties to the NAFTA152), rather than by a tribunal such as the present one established pursuant to Section B of Chapter Eleven. However, that procedure depends on a request by the disputing State Party, and no such request was made on behalf of Mexico in the present case. Article 1415(4) provides that when no request for decision by the Committee has been presented to the tribunal concerning the validity of a defense under Article 1410, the validity of the defense is to be decided by the Tribunal. Either way, while (i) the provision of a separate Chapter on Financial Services, (ii) the express provision of a prudential measures defense, and (iii) the provision for determination of the validity of such a defense at political level, suggest a consensus in favour of substantial deference to the State Party, it is also clear that when such a defense is presented in the context of an investor-State dispute, acceptance or rejection of the defense must be made on a collegial basis, and not unilaterally by the State that has taken the challenged measure.\n\n*See* Article 1412 and Annex 1412.1 for the composition and mission of this Committee.\n\n168.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes with respect to prudential measures that Article 1410 of the NAFTA provides a defense to the State-Party if a tribunal has found a challenged measure to constitute an expropriation in violation of Article 1110 of the NAFTA. The validity of that defense, if necessary to decide a claim under Article 1110, is to be judged either by the Financial Services Committee, or if no request has been submitted for invoking the Committee procedure, by the arbitral tribunal. In the present case, the issue whether the challenged measures were reasonable or arbitrary is moot, because the Tribunal has not found these measures to constitute expropriation under the NAFTA for reasons examined in the next Section of this Award.\n\n**E. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n169.\n\nHaving examined various aspects concerning the dispute in the preceding Sections, the Tribunal will now turn to FFIC's claim that the use and value of its investment, i.e., the US$ 50 million Debentures, were expropriated by Mexico and that Mexico thereby has violated its obligations under Article 1110 of the NAFTA.\n\n170.\n\nArticle 1110 (Expropriation and Compensation) of the NAFTA provides:\n\n1. No Party may directly or indirectly nationalize or expropriate an investment of an investor of another Party in its territory or take a measure tantamount to nationalization or expropriation of such an investment (\"expropriation\"), except:\n\n(a) for a public purpose;\n\n(b) on a non-discriminatory basis;\n\n(c) in accordance with due process of law and Article 1105(1); and\n\n(d) on payment of compensation in accordance with paragraphs 2 through 6.\n\n2. Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriation took place (\"date of expropriation\"), and shall not reflect any change in value occurring because the intended expropriation had become known earlier. Valuation criteria shall include going concern value, asset value including declared tax value of tangible property, and other criteria, as appropriate, to determine fair market value.\n\n3. Compensation shall be paid without delay and be fully realizable.\n\n4. If payment is made in a G7 currency, compensation shall include interest at a commercially reasonable rate for that currency from the date of expropriation until the date of actual payment.\n\n5. If a Party elects to pay in a currency other than a G7 currency, the amount paid on the date of payment, if converted into a G7 currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that date, shall be no less than if the amount of compensation owed on the date of expropriation had been converted into that G7 currency at the market rate of exchange prevailing on that date, and interest had accrued at a commercially reasonable rate for that G7 currency from the date of expropriation until the date of payment.\n\n6. On payment, compensation shall be freely transferable as provided in Article 1109.\n\n7. This Article does not apply to the issuance of compulsory licenses granted in relation to intellectual property rights, or to the revocation, limitation or creation of intellectual property rights, to the extent that such issuance, revocation, limitation or creation is consistent with Chapter Seventeen (Intellectual Property).\n\n8. For purposes of this Article and for greater certainty, a nondiscriminatory measure of general application shall not be considered a measure tantamount to an expropriation of a debt security or loan covered by this Chapter solely on the ground that the measure imposes costs on the debtor that cause it to default on the debt.\n\n171.\n\nIt may be recalled that Article 1131(1) of the NAFTA requires the Tribunal to apply \"this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.\" The latter includes customary international law.\n\n172.\n\nIn this connection, the parties to the present case have debated the relevance of international case law relating to expropriation. It is true that arbitral awards do not constitute binding precedent. It is also true that a number of cases are fact-driven and that the findings in those cases cannot be transposed in and of themselves to other cases. It is further true that a number of cases are based on treaties that differ from the NAFTA in certain respects. However, cautious reliance on certain principles developed in a number of those cases, as persuasive authority, to the extent that they cover the same matters as the NAFTA, may advance the body of law, which in turn may serve predictability in the interest of both investors and host States.\n\n173.\n\nThe parties have in particular debated the relevance of the case law of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal. It is true that the Algiers Accords give a notion of expropriation different from Article 1110 of the NAFTA and also partially depart from customary international law (in particular: \"other measures affecting property rights\"). It is also true that some arbitral awards of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal are contradicted by others. However, keeping these caveats in mind, it is justified to rely on certain awards, or at least portions thereof, in determining the customary international law meaning of expropriation in the present case.\n\n174.\n\nIn determining whether a State Party to the NAFTA has violated its obligations under Article 1110 of the NAFTA, an arbitral tribunal has to start with the analysis whether an expropriation has occurred. Mexico correctly points out that one cannot start an inquiry into whether expropriation has occurred by examining whether the conditions in Article 1110(1) of the NAFTA for avoiding liability in the event of an expropriation have been fulfilled. That would indeed be putting the cart before the horse (\" *poner la carreta delante de los caballos* \").153 Paragraphs (a) through (d) do not bear on the question as whether an expropriation has occurred. Rather, the conditions contained in paragraphs (a) through (d) specify the parameters as to when a State would not be liable under Article 1110.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits \u00b6 237.\n\n175.\n\nFFIC seems to concede this point but argues that arbitral tribunals have relied on discrimination in their determination whether expropriation has taken place. That argument will be discussed below.154\n\n*See* \u00b6 203 *et seq. infra*.\n\n176.\n\nNAFTA does not give a definition for the word \"expropriation.\" In some ten cases in which Article 1110(1) of the NAFTA was considered to date, the definitions appear to vary. Considering those cases and customary international law in general, the present Tribunal retains the following elements.\n\n(a) Expropriation requires a taking (which may include destruction) by a government-type authority of an investment by an investor covered by the NAFTA.155\n\n(b) The covered investment may include intangible as well as tangible property.156\n\n(c) The taking must be a substantially157 complete deprivation of the economic use and enjoyment of the rights to the property, or of identifiable distinct parts thereof (i.e., it approaches total impairment).\n\n(d) The taking must be permanent, and not ephemeral or temporary.\n\n(e) The taking usually involves a transfer of ownership to another person (frequently the government authority concerned), but that need not necessarily be so in certain cases (e.g., total destruction of an investment due to measures by a government authority without transfer of rights).158\n\n(f) The effects of the host State's measures are dispositive, not the underlying intent, for determining whether there is expropriation.\n\n(g) The taking may be *de jure* or *de facto.*\n\n(h) The taking may be \"direct\" or \"indirect.\"159\n\n(i) The taking may have the form of a single measure or a series of related or unrelated measures over a period of time (the so-called \"creeping\" expropriation).\n\n(j) To distinguish between a compensable expropriation and a noncompensable regulation by a host State,160 the following factors (usually in combination) may be taken into account: whether the measure is within the recognized police powers of the host State; the (public) purpose and effect of the measure; whether the measure is discriminatory; the proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realized;161 and the bona fide nature of the measure.162\n\n(k) The investor's reasonable \"investment-backed expectations\" may be a relevant factor whether (indirect) expropriation has occurred.163\n\nA failure to act (an \"omission\") by a host State may also constitute a State measure tantamount to expropriation under particular circumstances, although those cases will be rare and seldom concern the omission alone. *See Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for International Wrongful Acts*, adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session (2001), Article 2, hereinafter \"ILC Draft Articles,\" available at: http://www.un.org/law/ilc/texts/State\\_responsibility/responsibilityfra.htm.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, at 98, available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/Mondev-Final.pdf. The tribunal in *Methanex* observed: \"[I]n *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Canada*, the tribunal held \u2018the Investor's access to the U.S. market is a property interest subject to protection under Article 1110 [n. 159 *infra*, at \u00b6 96]. Certainly, the restrictive notion of property as a material \u2018thing' is obsolete and has ceded its place to a contemporary conception which includes managerial control over components of a process that is wealth producing. In the view of the Tribunal, items such as goodwill and market share may, as Professor White wrote, \u2018constitute [] an element of value of an enterprise and as such may have been covered by some of the compensation payments' [Gillian White, NATIONALISATION OF FOREIGN PROPERTY, 49 (1961)]. Hence, in a comprehensive taking, these items may figure in the valuation.\" *Methanex Corp. v.

The factor is used by the European Court of Human Rights, *id.* at n. 140, and it may be questioned whether it is a viable source of interpreting Article 1110 of the NAFTA.\n\nThe factors attempt to close the perceived \"gaping loophole\" of a \"blanket exception for regulatory measures\" as articulated in *Pope v. Talbot*, *supra* n. 159, at \u00b6 99.

United Mexican States*, Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1, Award, 30 August 2000, at \u00b6 103, available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/MetacladAward-English.pdf (\"Thus, expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\"). In his judgment of 2 May 2001 on the application for setting aside the award, Typsoe J. observed at \u00b6 99: \"The Tribunal gave an extremely broad definition of expropriation for the purposes of Article 1110\" but held that such finding by the tribunal was a question of law that is not reviewable in the setting aside proceedings under the applicable arbitration law (available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/ documents/Metaclad-BCSCReview.pdf). FFIC also acknowledges that it \"did not cite *Metalclad* for its definition of expropriation\" (Reply on the Merits at \u00b6 110).\n\n178.\n\nAgainst the background of the foregoing, the Tribunal will turn to the question whether there was an expropriation with respect to FFIC's investment within the meaning of Article 1110 of the NAFTA.\n\n179.\n\nBefore making the analysis, a preliminary observation is in order. It relates to the nature of FFIC's investment, which were the Dollar Debentures in GFB. GFB's main asset was BanCrecer. At the time of the purchase in December 1995, BanCrecer was in a delicate financial condition (i.e., a \"troubled bank\") and Mexico was in the process of recovering from a major financial crisis. In its report of 4 September 1995, JP Morgan **[** *advised Allianz about the performance and medium- to long-term prospects of the bank holding company and its assets.***]**\n\n180.\n\nFFIC, therefore, took a commercial risk that its investment could be adversely affected. It took that risk in light of its desire to have an \"admission ticket\" to the \"personal lines\" insurance business in Mexico.167\n\n**[***REDACTED***]**\n\n181.\n\nIt soon appeared that the first Recapitalization Plan, in the context of which FFIC's Dollar Debentures had been contributed, was insufficient as the financial position of BanCrecer further deteriorated.168 It required another Recapitalization Plan in June 1996, as amended on 31 December 1996, to which Mexico made significant further contributions. In 1997, the financial position of BanCrecer again deteriorated.\n\n*See* for the development of the financial position of BanCrecer and GFB, in particular, Counter Memorial on the Merits at \u00b6\u00b6 59-77, which FFIC has not rebutted convincingly.\n\n182.\n\nAt that point in time, it can be fairly assumed that, although interest bearing, the Dollar Debentures had significantly decreased in value. A buyer would take into account that BanCrecer may collapse, which would probably have meant a default by GFB on the interest payments and make a conversion into shares illusory. In short, the Dollar Debentures had acquired a status comparable to that of junk bonds.\n\n183.\n\nFFIC's contention that Mexico had somehow the obligation to preserve the value of FFIC's investment, therefore, is already factually incorrect to large extent as there was very little value left.\n\n184.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal is mindful of the observation by the tribunal in *Waste Management* :\n\nIt is not the function of Article 1110 to compensate for failed business ventures, absent arbitrary intervention by the State amounting to a virtual taking or sterilizing of the enterprise.169\n\n*Waste Management, Inc, v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, at \u00b6 160, available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/laudo ingles.pdf. *See also Robert Azinian et al. v. Mexico,* Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2, Award, 1 November 1999, at \u00b6\u00b6 83, 87, 90-91, available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/Azinian-English.pdf.\n\n185.\n\nAs mentioned in \u00b6 103 above, FFIC asserts that Mexico permanently deprived it of the use and value of its investment because of five acts or omissions. For reasons of convenience, those acts and omissions are reproduced here:.\n\n(i) In early 1998, the Government of Mexico compelled FFIC to use its investment to further the Government's Recapitalization Plan for BanCrecer.\n\n(ii) After compelling FFIC to participate in the Government's Recapitalization Plan, the Government proceeded to thwart the Program to which it had committed itself, thereby depriving FFIC of the value of its investment as envisioned under the Program.\n\n(iii) At or around the same time that the Government approved and then subsequently failed to carry out the Recapitalization Plan for BanCrecer, the Government discriminately refused to authorize the repurchase of FFIC's Dollar Debentures at face value, as the Government had done for the Mexican investors of the Peso Debentures.\n\n(iv) The Government of Mexico also deprived FFIC of the value of its investment by returning, in November 1998, the nonperforming loan portfolios acquired by FOBAPROA from 19951997.\n\n(v) The Government of Mexico, through IBAP, took the ultimate step to deprive FFIC of the value of its investment by taking control of BanCrecer in November 1999.170\n\nThis reflects the final position put forward by FFIC. The Tribunal notes that at other times counsel for FFIC suggested other dates, going back to November 1997. *See* Transcript of the hearing p. 1117:8-9.\n\n186.\n\nThe *first* act alleged by FFIC cannot be considered by any standard a taking that deprived FFIC of the economic use and enjoyment of the Dollar Debentures.\n\n187.\n\nIn early 1998, BanCrecer, which, as mentioned, was GFB's most important asset, was in a critical situation. **[***REDACTED***]**\n\n**[***REDACTED* **]**171\n\n***[*** *REDACTED* ***]***  *See also* Transcript of the hearing 631:12-632:14 (examination of Mr. Jos\u00e9 Antonio Garc\u00eda, agreeing with the assessment by JP Morgan of the financial condition of BanCrecer).\n\n188.\n\nIf no action had been taken at that time, by way of recapitalization or otherwise, it would have been highly likely that BanCrecer would have collapsed (as it is borne out by the subsequent events). **[***REDACTED***]** 172 As a consequence, the FFIC's Dollar Debentures must be deemed to have had a very low value in early 1998. Without the Recapitalization Plan, they would have become totally worthless.\n\n***[*** *REDACTED* ***]*** The Tribunal wishes to make it clear that these findings relate to the alleged taking of property, and not to a quantification of possible damages.\n\n189.\n\nAssuming that the Government of Mexico \"compelled\" FFIC to participate in the Recapitalization Plan in early 1998, it was for the purposes of rescuing FFIC's investment, rather than taking it away from FFIC.\n\n190.\n\nMoreover, it cannot be said that the Government of Mexico \"compelled\" FFIC to participate in the Recapitalization Plan. Actually, the facts show that GFB and BanCrecer, assisted by JP Morgan, took the initiative for a recapitalization plan at the end of 1997 in consultation with FFIC and the Government authorities, because of the deteriorated financial condition of BanCrecer.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see how the alleged \"requirement\" of the Government of Mexico would have deprived FFIC of its ability to sell the investment to an interested buyer early 1998. FFIC never raised that option at the time; rather it sought to recapitalize BanCrecer. In addition, it is highly unlikely that FFIC would have found a willing buyer, at least for an amount of US$ 50 million. As mentioned, in early 1998, the financial condition of BanCrecer was such that FFIC's Dollar Debentures had very little value. The Tribunal does not consider the Trust that repurchased the Peso Debentures as a willing buyer of the Dollar Debentures for reasons explained later.173\n\n*See* \u00b6 209 *infra*.\n\n192.\n\nThe contentions regarding the *second* act as alleged by FFIC must also fail. It is based on a Recapitalization Progam that never materialized. FFIC's Dollar Debentures were never redeemed and FFIC never made the additional US$ 50 million capital contribution. Nor was the participation by a foreign bank accomplished. Consequently, the Mexican authorities cannot have proceeded \"to thwart the Program\" or \"destroy\" that Program.\n\n193.\n\nAssuming that the Government authorities had made promises, as it is alleged by FFIC, those promises did not include \"the Government's promise that Fireman's Fund would receive full value for its debentures.\"174 Rather, the Dollar Debentures would have been redeemed as capital but the Government authorities did not promise to give FFIC a guarantee about the face value of that capital.\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6 103.\n\n194.\n\nThe alleged promises are based on a meeting in the evening of 26 February 1998 at the office of the Governor of Banco de M\u00e9xico.175 The Tribunal considers it likely that what was discussed at that meeting is what FFIC has contended factually in the present proceedings and that those present at the meeting adopted the main features of the Recapitalization Plan. **[***REDACTED***]** are inconclusive, the witnesses of Mexico, to the extent that Mexico has called them, have not convinced the Tribunal of the contrary. Moreover, the Mexican authorities did not oppose in any manner the press release of GFB and JP Morgan of 27 February 1998.177\n\n*See* \u00b6 66 *supra*.\n\n*See* \u00b6 68 *supra*. *See also* n. 149 *supra.*\n\n195.\n\nHowever, FFIC must be deemed to have been aware that what was discussed at the meeting did not yet constitute a binding agreement between the parties. The reasons are set forth in \u00b6\u00b6 153-154 above. Furthermore, the introduction to the Memorandum of Intent of May 1998, designated as a \"DRAFT FOR DISCUSSION,\" makes clear that: \"[N]o obligation included herein shall be enforceable until the respective approvals are obtained,\" and that: \"The terms of the program described herein shall be documented in the final contracts executed to formalize these agreements to the satisfaction of the parties.\"178\n\n*See* \u00b6 74 *supra*.\n\n196.\n\nIt should also be added that the agreement envisaged a participation of 40-40-20, the new foreign bank retaining 40%.179 When the discussion about the agreement took place, a participation of 40% by a foreign company was legally not possible in Mexico. Subsequently, it was envisaged to have a participation of 51% via a subsidiary. Such change reinforces the finding that no definite agreement had been concluded.\n\n*See* \u00b6 78 *supra*.\n\n197.\n\nMexico, therefore, cannot be considered to have \"repudiated\" an agreement on a recapitalization in 1998. At best, the understanding reached at the meeting of 26 February 1998 constituted an agreement to agree, subject to further negotiations.\n\n198.\n\nOn the basis of the record before it, the Tribunal is of the view that the Mexican authorities did not behave appropriately in failing to pursue the conclusion of an agreement. The Tribunal is persuaded that the Mexican authorities had at least read a copy of the Memorandum of Intent at the relevant time. The reason for Mexico's failure to sign the Memorandum of Intent and to conclude the agreement may have been a change in the political climate in Mexico at the time.180 It may also be due to fact that Mexico amended its legislation in December 1998 to the effect that any rescue plan of a bank required that the existing capital be first applied to losses.181\n\n*See* \u00b6 77 *supra*.\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits at \u00b6 288, 3d bullet.\n\n199.\n\nYet, such a failure cannot be elevated to interference by a host State in the rights of an investor in the sense that it constitutes a deprivation of the investor's rights in its investment within the meaning of Article 1110 of the NAFTA. The object of the proposed agreement was to rescue BanCrecer with the participation of the Government, FFIC, shareholders of GFB and a new foreign bank. It would have had as effect that FFIC's investment was to be redeemed as capital in BanCrecer. At the time, FFIC's investment was almost valueless, due to the financially poor condition of BanCrecer. That condition was not caused by any government act or omission, but rather by the economic circumstances prevailing at the time. A failure to enter into a binding agreement to improve that condition, and possibly FFIC's investment, does not deprive FFIC's investment of its economic use since there was virtually none at the time of the Government's failure.\n\n200.\n\nThe *third* act is more troubling but does not constitute a taking under Article 1110 of the NAFTA either.\n\n201.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Peso Debentures repurchase discriminated against FFIC.182 It may be that the origin of the repurchase in November 1997 was a deficient documentation for a number of Mexican purchasers of Peso Debentures (\" *mal colocadas* \"). However, the Tribunal finds it inexplicable that, subsequently in the beginning of 1998, the repurchase of the Peso Debentures at face value was applied to *all* Peso Debentures purchases. It is unconvincing, as Mexico alleges, that it was impossible to distinguish between \" *sin contrato* \" and \" *con contrato*,\" having also regard to the large amount and number of purchasers involved. The Tribunal is further troubled by the fact that the repurchase of the Peso Debentures was organized by means of a trust set up, controlled and financed by BanCrecer, a subsidiary of GFB. The acquisition was not \"temporal\" either, as on 30 September 2002 the Peso Debentures were still on the Trust's books at almost their face value.183 Worse even, the whole repurchase scheme, as it evolved, was not disclosed to FFIC, which discovered it accidentally in April 1998 when it had been completed for some 65%.184 It is also clear that the Government authorities were, at a minimum, aware of the repurchase program and its financing as from its inception.185\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 64, 70-73 and 86 *supra*.\n\n*See* \u00b6 101 *supra*.\n\nEven though some 645 Mexican holders of debentures were involved.\n\nAs becomes clear from, *inter alia*, the letters of 8 December 1997 from CNBV to BanCrecer (Exh. R0172-0173) and 12 August 1998 from CNBV to GFB and BanCrecer (Exh. C0029-30, C0111, C0737-38, C0802). A copy of the Trust Agreement was sent by BanCrecer to CNBV by letter of 16 April 1998 (Exh. C0104-07).\n\n202.\n\nThe understandable reaction of FFIC was to ask for equal treatment by the Mexican authorities. On various occasions, the Mexican authorities refused to allow FFIC via GFB to have the Dollar Debentures repurchased at face value. While the Tribunal does not pass judgment on Mexican law or its interpretation and application, it is not convinced by the justification offered by Banco de M\u00e9xico that \"anticipated payment\" of convertible debentures is not allowed under Mexican law.186 If that were so, one can ask the question why all the Peso Debentures were allowed to be repurchased. The distinctions that Mexico attempts to make between the two are formalistic and cannot mask that, in substance, there was discrimination. Moreover, FFIC did make it clear to the Mexican authorities that it was flexible as to the manner in which the repurchase of the Dollar Debentures was to be formalized.\n\n*See* \u00b6 86 *supra*.\n\n203.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this is a clear case of discriminatory treatment of a foreign investor. If there is a \"haircut\" for holders of debentures, all should be shaven.187 Conversely, if one is allowed to escape the hands of the barber, the other should be allowed to escape as well. That was also recognized by CNBV in its Note for Discussion of 9 September 1999.188 Such treatment might have given rise to claim by an investor under Articles 1102 (National Treatment), Article 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), or Article 1405 (National Treatment) of the NAFTA, or under two or all of them. The question before the Tribunal is whether it could also give rise to a claim under Article 1110 (Expropriation and Compensation) of the NAFTA since the Tribunal lacks competence over claims under Articles 1102, 1105 and 1405.189 The Tribunal concludes that it does not rise to a claim under Article 1110.\n\nTranscript of the hearing 912:6-925:12 and 953:2-956:2 (examination of Dra. Armend\u00e1riz Guerra).\n\n*See* \u00b6 87 *supra*.\n\n*See* \u00b6 22 *supra*.\n\n204.\n\nFFIC relies upon a number of precedents in which discriminatory treatment was considered a factor in expropriation cases. These cases address discriminatory treatment in relation to expropriation in two settings.\n\n205.\n\nFirst, discriminatory treatment is used to determine whether the expropriation was unlawful. In the *L* *IAMCO* case, quoted by FFIC, the tribunal considered that \"a purely discriminatory nationalization is illegal and wrongful\" under international law.190 However, it presupposes the presence of a nationalization (or expropriation). In the present case, the question is whether there was expropriation. It cannot be argued that because there is discrimination, there is expropriation.\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6 111. *Libyan American Oil Co. v. The Government of the Libyan Arab Republic*, Award, 12 April 1977, 20 I.L.M. 1, 59 (1981).\n\n206.\n\nSecond, as mentioned before, discriminatory treatment is used as one of the factors to distinguish between a compensable expropriation and a non-compensable regulation by a host State.191 In *Schering Corp*., also quoted by FFIC, the tribunal considered: \"[t]he exchange restrictions could constitute a taking subject to compensation under international law\" and that such finding \"is dependent upon such factors as whether such restrictions are non-discriminatory, whether such restrictions are justified on bona fide economic grounds and whether such restrictions, in effect, extinguish a foreign national's enjoyment and use of its currency.\"192\n\n*See* \u00b6 176 at (h) *supra*.\n\nMemorial on the Merits n. 239. *Schering Corp. v. The Islamic Republic of Iran*, Award No. 12238-3, 13 April 1984, 5 Iran U.S. C.T.R. 361 (R. Mosk dissenting). FFIC also relies (Memorial on the Merits \u00b6 114) on the *Middle East Cement* case, in which the tribunal considered a claim for \"incurred damages\" allegedly arising out of a bank loan, foreign employees' compensation, and liquidation expenses. The tribunal rejected those claims, observing: \"To accept a claim in this regard under the BIT, the Tribunal would have to find \u2018measures the effect of which would be tantamount to expropriation' (Art. 4). The provision, thus, does not cover any losses occurring to an investor due to commercial risks or due to procedures of the State authorities and courts as long as they are under due process of law and not discriminatory (Art. 4a) and b)).\" *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A., v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6. Award, 12 April 2002, at \u00b6 153, available at: http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/MECement-award.pdf. This reliance by FFIC is unjustified since the tribunal in *Middle East Cement* considered relief sought for compensation of an alleged expropriation rather than considering the question whether there was a measure tantamount to expropriation. In any event, the passing observation by the tribunal in *Middle East Cement* cannot be relied upon in support of the proposition that if there is discrimination, there is expropriation (or a measure tantamount to expropriation).\n\n207.\n\nAssuming that the conduct of the Mexican authorities complained of by FFIC pertained to regulatory conduct, as it is argued by FFIC, it did not involve a taking. FFIC's case is premised on: \"The Government undertook to recapitalize the Bank, with the necessary effect of preserving investors' value in that enterprise.\"193 That premise is incorrect for two reasons. First, the Tribunal has not been presented with convincing evidence that there was a specific undertaking of Mexico to recapitalize BanCrecer vis-\u00e0-vis FFIC in 1995 and onwards. With respect to the Recapitalization Plan of 1998, the Tribunal has found that it did not amount to a definite agreement.194 Nor were there reasonable investor-backed expectations created by Mexico, even though Mexico should have pursued the conclusion of an agreement. Second, as pointed out above, there was little or no value left of FFIC's investment in 1998. A discriminatory lack of effort by a host State to rescue an investment that has become virtually worthless, is not a taking of that investment.\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6 116.\n\n*See* \u00b6 193 *et seq. supra*.\n\n208.\n\nFFIC further argues that international tribunals have recognized that in expropriation cases it is significant whether government's acts or omissions are unfair or inequitable.195 FFIC makes that proposition by relying on paragraph (c) of Article 1110(1) of the NAFTA which prohibits expropriation except \"in accordance with due process of law and Article 1105(1).\" Article 1105(1) concerns Minimum Standard of Treatment. FFIC's argument must fail since, as mentioned before,196 it must be determined first whether an expropriation has occurred, while paragraphs (a) through (d) specify the parameters as to when a State would not be liable under Article 1110. Moreover, FFIC's argument would conflate an Article 1110 claim with an Article 1105 claim, which is clearly inconsistent with the exclusion of Article 1105 claims from investor-State arbitration under Chapter Fourteen.\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6 117.\n\n*See* \u00b6 174 *supra*.\n\n209.\n\nA final point regarding the Trust is that it cannot be considered a \"willing buyer,\" as is contended by FFIC in support of its argument that the Dollar Debentures were worth the equivalent of US$ 50 million in 1997-1998. The Trust was set up, controlled and financed by BanCrecer, a subsidiary of GFB. Its initial objective was to restitute the original purchase price to those Mexican buyers of the Peso Debentures who claimed to have deficient documentation. The fact that, subsequently, the restitution amount (i.e., the face value of the Peso Debentures) became the repurchase price for all Mexican buyers of the Peso Debentures - a matter that is indeed surprising - does not make the Trust a genuine willing buyer who would have been prepared to pay a price in an open market.197\n\n*See also* \u00b6 182 *supra*.\n\n210.\n\nThe *fourth* act is the return of the loan portfolio by FOBAPROA in November 1998. The Tribunal can be relatively short with this claim of FFIC.\n\n211.\n\nOne would have thought that after the audit of the initial loan portfolio by Mancera, S.C. Ernst & Young, the matter was settled.198 However, BanCrecer and FOBAPROA continued discussions about the loans that qualified for the assumption and the required reserves ***[*** *REDACTED* ***]***. More discussions ensued after the further recapitalizations. In the latter cases, which added significantly to the nonperforming loan portfolio purportedly assumed by FOBAPROA, no such auditing appears to have taken place, at least it is not part of the record. ***[*** *REDACTED***]**\n\n*See also* n. 6 and \u00b6\u00b6 60, 62 and 80 *supra*.\n\n212.\n\nThe back-and-forth between FOBAPROA and BanCrecer about the various loan portfolios and the reserves is well explained ***[***  *REDACTED*  ***]*****[** *REDACTED***]**. The facts show that BanCrecer and FOBAPROA were unable to agree on the loans that qualified and the required reserves. It does not appear that BanCrecer opposed the return of the portfolio, although one may be puzzled by the fact why *all* loans were returned.\n\n213.\n\nGFB took advice from Bufete Carrillo Gamboa, S.C. some seven months later. In its opinion of 23 June 1999, Bufete Carrillo Gamboa, S.C. concluded that the return of the portfolio was of questionable legality.202 The advice is qualified by assumptions which turned out not to be correct. In particular, it assumed the proper fulfillment by BanCrecer of the obligations undertaken in the various agreements. The Tribunal infers from the record that that was one of the main issues in the discussions between FOBAPROA and BanCrecer. Since BanCrecer did not oppose the return of the portfolio, it seems that FOBAPROA's position in the discussions was not unlawful. Actually, by letter of 14 October 1999, GFB and BanCrecer accepted the cancellation of the taking-over of the portfolio, at least that part that concerned the Recapitalization Plan of 28 June 1996.203\n\n*See* \u00b6 85 *supra*.\n\nExh. R1923. FFIC contends that this letter was orchestrated by the Mexican authorities. The Tribunal has not been presented with convincing evidence that such orchestration took place.\n\n214.\n\nIn any event, the effect of the return of the portfolio in November 1998 cannot be said to have taken away the value of FFIC's investment. At that point in time, the financial position of BanCrecer was so bad, that it was *de facto* already in a state of insolvency. Moreover, the effect of the return of the portfolio appears to be included in BanCrecer's financial statements for 1999 only.\n\n215.\n\nFFIC is also incorrect about its argument relating to reasonable reliance on commitments made by FOBAPROA.204 Those commitments concerned the initial loan portfolio. The assumption of that portfolio appeared to be subject to problems of a technical nature. In addition, the next batch of non-performing loans was not only significantly larger but was also assumed by FOBAPROA well after December 1995. Hence, no legitimate expectations could have been created in that regard.\n\nMemorial on the Merits \u00b6\u00b6 121-122.\n\n216.\n\nFinally, the *fifth* act is the taking of control by IPAB of BanCrecer in November 1999. Here again, the Tribunal can be relatively brief. It appears that the shareholders of BanCrecer, i.e., GFB, voted in favour of a taking of control by IPAB over BanCrecer and a dissolution and liquidation of GFB.205 They did so in light of the hopeless financial position of BanCrecer and as a consequence of GFB. The facts do not demonstrate that the action by IPAB constituted a taking by IPAB in the sense of an expropriation on behalf of the State.\n\n*See* \u00b6 91 *supra*.\n\n217.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the acts and omissions alleged by FFIC constitutes individually, or taken together, an expropriation of FFIC's investment under Article 1110 of the NAFTA and the elements identified in \u00b6176 above.206 As a consequence, FFIC's claim to find that that the Government of Mexico, through its acts and omissions, expropriated FFIC's investment in Dollar Debentures issued by GFB in violation of Article 1110 of the NAFTA, must be rejected.\n\n**[** *REDACTED* **]**\n\nThe reliance by FFIC on the award in *Saluka*, *see* \u00b6 43 *supra*, is to no avail to it since the issue of failure to accord fair and equitable treatment on which that award was based is not within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n**F. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n218.\n\nWhile Claimant FFIC has clearly demonstrated injury - indeed loss of its investment - none of its claims, separately or in the aggregate, satisfy the concept of expropriation as understood in the NAFTA and in international law in general. FFIC undertook an investment that was risky both in terms of the economic conditions in Mexico at the time, and in terms of the specific financial institution that issued the Dollar Debentures that FFIC purchased. The NAFTA, like other free trade agreements and bilateral investment treaties, does not provide insurance against the kinds of risks that FFIC assumed, and Chapter Fourteen addressed to cross-border investment in financial institutions, places further limits on the scope of investor-State arbitration. In rejecting the claim of Fireman's Fund submitted to it in this arbitration, the Tribunal does not mean to suggest that Claimant was not subject to discriminatory and perhaps inequitable treatment by officials of the host State. It holds only that the evidence submitted to the Tribunal has not demonstrated a right to compensation under Article 1110 of the NAFTA, as incorporated by reference in Article 1401 of the NAFTA.\n\n**G. Damages**\n--------------\n\n219.\n\nSince the Tribunal has found that the acts and omissions as alleged by FFIC do not constitute expropriation under Article 1110 of the NAFTA, FFIC is not entitled to compensation on that account. Consequently, the Tribunal rejects FFIC's claim for compensation. As a further consequence, the next phase of the arbitration concerning quantification of damages (*see* \u00b621 above) is no longer necessary.\n\n**[** *REDACTED* **]**\n\n**VIII. COSTS**\n---------------\n\n220.\n\nThe parties agreed at the hearing that no cost submissions were to be made in the present phase of the arbitration.207 The Tribunal understands this agreement to be premised on the assumption that cost submissions would be made during a next phase concerning quantification of damages. In light of the conclusions reached in this Award, such a phase will not take place. Separate cost submissions are also not required since the Tribunal has reached the conclusion that each Party shall bear its own costs and shall share 50% each of the Tribunal's costs. The latter corresponds to the advances for cost made by each Party.\n\nTranscript of the hearing 1299.\n\n221.\n\nMexico prevailed on the Preliminary Question and in the present phase on the merits. On the basis of the principle set forth in *International Thunderbird Gaming Corp. v. United Mexican States*,208 it would mean that costs should be awarded in favour of Mexico. However, the circumstances of the present case are such that the Tribunal believes that it is justified to deviate from that principle. The Preliminary Question was a close one and lost by Fireman's Fund on a technicality, while Fireman's Funds had respectable claims on the merits under Section A of Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA, over which, however, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction in this case except Article 1110 concerning expropriation.\n\nFinal Award, 26 January 2006, NAFTA (UNCITRAL), at \u00b6\u00b6 210-215, available at: http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Thunderbird-Mexico-Award.pdf\n\n**IX. RESERVED INFORMATION AND RESTRICTED ACCESS**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 3 of 31 March 2004, the Tribunal ruled at paragraph 7:\n\nIf and to the extent that the Tribunal makes use of Confidential Documents or information derived therefrom in any decision, including an arbitral award, it shall designate the portions relating to such documents or information as confidential and those portions shall not be published by the persons authorized under paragraphs 3 and 4 of the present Order to third parties.\n\n223.\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 5 of 23 August 2004, the provisions of Procedural Order No. 3 were ruled to apply *mutatis mutandis* to documents submitted in response to Respondent's Request that contain business confidential information.\n\n224.\n\nAll submissions by the parties subsequent to the issuance of Procedural Orders Nos. 3 and 5 are designated as \"This Document Contains Reserved Information\" (FFIC) and \" *Este Documento Contiene Informaci\u00f3n con Acceso Restringido* \" (Mexico), while a number of exhibits and witness statements bear similar language. Having regard to this situation, it is not entirely clear to the Tribunal whether, and if so to what extent, it has relied on Confidential Documents or information derived therefrom in the present Award.\n\n225.\n\nThe parties, therefore, are ordered to attempt to reach agreement, within 30 days after the date of dispatch of this Award, on which portions, if any, of the present Award shall be redacted for the purposes of Orders Nos. 3 and 5.\n\n**X. DECISIONS**\n----------------\n\n226.\n\nFOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, the Arbitral Tribunal renders the following decisions:\n\n(1) REJECTS FFIC's request to find that the Government of Mexico, through its acts and omissions, violated Article 1110 of the NAFTA by expropriating FFIC's investment in dollar-denominated debentures issued by Grupo Financiero BanCrecer S.A. de CV;\n\n(2) REJECTS FFIC's request that the Tribunal award it compensation for the full value of its investment;\n\n(3) DETERMINES that each Party shall bear its own costs and that the Parties shall share the Tribunal's costs in equal shares corresponding to the advances on cost made by them;\n\n(4) ORDERS the Parties to attempt to reach agreement, within 30 days after the date of dispatch of this Award, on which portions, if any, of the present Award shall be redacted for the purposes of complying with Procedural Orders Nos. 3 and 5."}]}
