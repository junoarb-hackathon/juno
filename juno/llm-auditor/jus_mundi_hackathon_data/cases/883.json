PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n15.\n\nFollowing the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration (\"**Request**\") and Supplement No. 1 to the Request for Arbitration (\"**Supplement to Request**\") dated 30 July and 21 August 2009 respectively, the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**Secretary-General**\" and \"**Centre**\" respectively) registered the present dispute on 16 September 2009.\n\n16.\n\nOn 15 December 2009, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal would be constituted of three arbitrators, one arbitrator appointed by each party and the third, the President of the Tribunal, appointed by agreement of the Parties. Subsequently, the Claimant and the Respondents appointed Messrs. John Beechey and Toby Landau respectively. Both arbitrators accepted their appointments. The Parties then agreed to appoint Mr. Neil Kaplan as presiding arbitrator. Mr. Kaplan accepted his appointment and, on 8 January 2010, the Secretary-General sent a letter to the Parties announcing the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal (\"**the Tribunal**\").\n\n17.\n\nOn 9 April 2009, the Parties and the Tribunal met for the First Session at the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, the Netherlands. Shortly thereafter, the Minutes of the First Session were served on the Parties (\"**Minutes**\"). In accordance with the relevant articles of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\" or \"**the Convention**\") and the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Arbitration Rules**\"), these Minutes addressed, in relevant part, the following points:\n\n(a) apportionment of costs and advance payments to the Centre;\n\n(b) fees and expenses of the Tribunal members;\n\n(c) applicable Arbitration Rules: the 2006 ICSID Arbitration Rules;\n\n(d) place of the proceedings: The Hague, Netherlands;\n\n(e) procedural language: English;\n\n(f) transcription service at the hearing;\n\n(g) means of communications and submissions;\n\n(h) quorum of arbitrators at the hearing;\n\n(i) convening of a pre-hearing conference;\n\n(j) procedure to adopt with regards to the production of evidence through witness statements and expert reports;\n\n(k) decisions of the Tribunal and appropriate means of communication;\n\n(l) delegation of power to fix and extend time limits;\n\n(m) written and oral procedures; and\n\n(n) sequence of pleadings according to the following timetable which distinguished whether the issue on jurisdiction would be bifurcated or not.\n\n18.\n\nIn accordance with the Minutes, on 2 July 2010, the Claimant served its Memorial on the Merits Part 1 - Jurisdiction and Liability.\n\n19.\n\nOn 12 July 2010, the Respondents wrote to the Tribunal stating that the Claimant had omitted to request any relief in its Memorial of 2 July 2010. Accordingly, Respondents stated that they would rely upon the requests for relief contained in the Claimant\u2019s Request unless Claimant clearly identified the relief that it sought within 24 hours.\n\n20.\n\nOn the same day, Claimant responded that since the Merits were split in two parts, the first addressing liability, and the second addressing quantum, it was clear that the appropriate measure of damages would not be sought by Claimant until Part 2 of the submissions. In any event, Claimant contended that the opening and concluding paragraphs of its last submission included the relief sought. Claimant reiterated its reliefs as follows:\n\n(a) to hold EDC liable in damages for its repudiation of, defaults under and/or other breaches of the PPA;\n\n(b) to hold KOC liable in damages for its repudiation of, defaults under and/or other breaches of the IA;\n\n(c) to hold KOC liable pursuant to its obligation in the DOG to pay all amounts owed by EDC to CPC under the PPA; and\n\n(d) to hold KOC liable in respect of EDC\u2019s repudiation of, defaults under and/or other breaches of the PPA that are attributable to KOC under the state responsibility doctrine.\n\n21.\n\nOn the next day, the Respondents denied that the relief sought by the Claimant should be included in Part 2 of the submissions which were intended only to deal with the pure quantification of damages. The Respondents asserted that the factual and legal bases of the damages sought had to be set out in Part 1 of the submissions and therefore could not be modified in Part 2.\n\n22.\n\nOn 20 July 2010, the Respondents served their Preliminary Objections and requested that the proceedings be bifurcated.\n\n23.\n\nOn 30 July 2010, the Claimant served its Response to Respondents\u2019 Preliminary Objections, and objected to the request for bifurcation.\n\n24.\n\nBy letter on the same day, the Respondents took issue with Claimant\u2019s allegations of corruption against officials of the Cambodian government contained in Claimant\u2019s submissions. The Respondents maintained that these allegations were unfounded and unsupported by any documents, and asked the Tribunal to strike out paragraphs 78, 93, 218 and 273 of the witness statement of Mr. William Garret (\"**Mr. Garret**\"). In addition, Respondents objected to the \"*unsupported allegations made in reliance on documents not submitted by the Claimant*.\" The Respondents maintained that the Claimant should have submitted all documents upon which it intended to rely in these proceedings with its Memorial on the Merits. A list of these unsupported allegations was annexed to the letter.\n\n25.\n\nOn 3 August 2010, the Respondents wrote a letter to the Tribunal stating that the Claimant\u2019s Response to the Respondents\u2019 Preliminary Objections was in contravention of the agreed timetable as this submission was not limited to a brief description of arguments concerning bifurcation, but instead it articulated most of Claimant\u2019s case on the merits. The Respondents also stated that the Claimant had misinterpreted the Respondents\u2019 position.\n\n26.\n\nOn the next day, the Claimant objected to the Respondents\u2019 letter which presented other arguments and new legal authorities not permitted by the timetable contained in the Minutes. The Claimant added that it was unfair not to have afforded it an opportunity to respond. Finally, the Claimant denied the Respondents\u2019 allegations that the Claimant had set out its case on the merits rather than addressing the bifurcation issue in its Response to the Respondents\u2019 Preliminary Objections.\n\n27.\n\nOn 23 August 2010, the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the proceedings and to hold a hearing on jurisdiction on 6-7 December 2010 in Hong Kong (\"**the Hearing**\"). The Tribunal also provided the following directions with regard to the issues to be addressed at the Hearing (by reference to the list of issues proposed by the Respondents):\n\n*(a) Issue 1: Does the Tribunal have a jurisdiction over EDC? In other words whether or not EDC is an \"agency\" for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.*\n\n*(b) Issue 2: The admissibility of two separate claims under a single proceeding.*\n\n*(c) Issue 3: Claims under the Deed of Guarantee. The only claim here that will be heard in December is the issue relating to the allegation that no claim under the Deed was advanced in the Request for Arbitration. All other issues relating to the Deed of Guarantee will be heard in a merits hearing.*\n\n*(d) Issue 4: Whether under Cambodian company law the claimants\u2019 corporate decisions relating to the commencement of this arbitration are valid or invalid.*\n\n*(e) Issue 5: Time bar. This will be heard in a merits hearing.*\n\n*(f) Issue 6: Objections to claims of State Responsibility. The only issue here that can be heard in December is the effect of the allegation that such claims were not pleaded in the request for arbitration. The argument that the claimants\u2019 case on customary international law is wrong in principle will only be heard in a merits hearing.*\n\n*(g) Issue 7: Force Majeure. This will only be heard in a merits hearing.*\n\n28.\n\nOn 16 September 2010, the Respondents withdrew their objection to the Claimant\u2019s authority to bring the present proceedings as articulated in Section IV of the Respondents\u2019 Preliminary Objections dated 20 July 2010.\n\n29.\n\nOn 27 September 2010, after discussion between the Parties, the Tribunal ordered that Skeleton Arguments were to be exchanged on or before Monday 29 November 2010 at 5 pm E.S.T.\n\n30.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimant submitted to the Tribunal an application for permission to amend its 2 July 2010 submissions and to submit additional documentary evidence.\n\n31.\n\nOn 28 September 2010, the Respondents objected to the Claimant\u2019s application and assured the Tribunal that they would respond to this application after they had filed their Memorial on Preliminary Issues due on 6 October 2010.\n\n32.\n\nOn 6 October 2010, the Respondents served their Submissions on Preliminary Objections.\n\n33.\n\nOn 14 October 2010, the Respondents applied for the Tribunal\u2019s permission to introduce into evidence a recent decision rendered by an ICSID tribunal, namely *Gustav F W Hamester GmbH & Co KG v The Republic of Ghana, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/24, Award (18 June 2010)* (\"***Hamester***\").\n\n34.\n\nOn 15 October 2010, the Respondents wrote a letter to the Tribunal stating that three matters remained outstanding between the Parties. Respondents requested that:\n\n(a) the Claimant\u2019s corruption allegations articulated in the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits be struck out;\n\n(b) the Claimant\u2019s claims under customary international law be struck out; and\n\n(c) the Claimant\u2019s application for permission to amend its Memorial on the Merits and witness statements and to submit additional documentary evidence be denied.\n\n35.\n\nIn addition, the Respondents asked the Tribunal to issue a ruling on the costs incurred by the Respondents in reviewing and addressing the Claimant\u2019s application.\n\n36.\n\nOn the next day, the Claimant accepted the Respondents\u2019 late submission of the referenced authority, i.e. *Hamester*, but requested that Respondents submit a supplement to their submissions by 22 October 2010 so that the Claimant had a reasonable opportunity to address the Respondents\u2019 arguments in its Counter-Memorial.\n\n37.\n\nOn 20 October 2010, the Respondents submitted a letter setting out the relevance of the recent *Hamester* case.\n\n38.\n\nOn 21 October 2010, the Claimant responded to the Respondents\u2019 requests of 15 October 2010. The Claimant said that:\n\n(a) the Respondents\u2019 request to strike out portions of Mr. Garrett\u2019s testimony were without merit and not ripe for a ruling by the Tribunal;\n\n(b) the Respondents\u2019 request to strike out Claimant\u2019s claims under customary international law should be denied as those claims were properly articulated in the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits dated 2 July 2010; and\n\n(c) the Claimant\u2019s application to amend its submissions and to submit additional evidence should be granted as they did not constitute new claims.\n\n39.\n\nOn 3 November 2010, the Tribunal ruled on the three outstanding issues together with the question of costs raised by the Respondents. First, with regard to the Respondents\u2019 claim of unsupported and defamatory allegations of corruption made by the Claimant, the Tribunal decided that this was not a matter with which it could deal, and thus the Tribunal declined to strike out these allegations. Had the Claimant\u2019s allegations been defamatory, it was neither the Tribunal\u2019s mission nor within the Tribunal\u2019s power to investigate and condemn such behaviour. Second, with regard to the Respondents\u2019 objections concerning Claimant\u2019s claim under customary international law, the Tribunal decided that at this time it was premature to rule on this point. Accordingly it refused the Respondents\u2019 application to strike out the Claimant\u2019s claim based on customary international law. Thirdly, with regard to the Claimant\u2019s application for permission to amend its Memorial on the Merits and witness statements and to submit additional documentary evidence, the Tribunal noted that paragraph 14(d) of the Minutes gave it an element of discretion in this regard and therefore decided to grant the request. Fourthly, with regard to the Respondents\u2019 request for an award on costs, the Tribunal declined to make such an order at this stage.\n\n40.\n\nOn 12 November 2010, Claimant served its 167-page single-space Counter-Memorial on Respondents\u2019 Preliminary Objections (\"**Claimant\u2019s Counter Memorial**\").\n\n41.\n\nOn 29 November 2010, the Parties submitted their Skeleton Arguments.\n\n42.\n\nOn 30 November 2010, the Parties and the Presiding Arbitrator, on behalf of the Tribunal, had a case management conference by telephone.\n\n43.\n\nThe main Hearing took place from 6-7 December 2010 at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre (\"**HKIAC**\"). At the Hearing, the Claimant was represented by Mr. Richard Keck, who was assisted by Mr. Blechman both from Macmillan Keck. On the Claimant\u2019s side were also present Mr. Garrett, witness and employee of CPC and Ms. Se Muy Tan, employee of CPC. The Respondents were represented by Mr. Peter Turner and Ms. Marie Stoyanov, who were assisted by Mr. Sami Tannous and Dr. Kate Parlett, all from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer. On the Respondents\u2019 side were also present H.E. Ith Praing from MIME and H.E. Keo Rottanak from EDC. Other attendees of the hearing were Ms. Martina Polasek, Secretary of the Tribunal and Mr. Olivier Darcq, Legal Assistant to the President of the Tribunal.\n\n44.\n\nOn 13 December 2010, the Secretary of the Tribunal, acting upon instruction of the Tribunal, informed the Parties that ICSID had recently posted the award of 28 December 2009 in *Government of the Province of East Kalimantan v. P.T. Kaltim Prima Coal, et al (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/3)* (\"***East Kalimantan***\") on its website, and invited them to submit any observations on this decision by 20 December 2010.\n\n45.\n\nBy emails dated 20 December 2010, the Claimant and the Respondents submitted their observations.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND TO THE DISPUTE**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nIn 1994, KOC announced a tender process to select an independent power producer to invest in, construct, own and operate a 60MW electric power plant in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, known as the C-4 power plant project, and to sell that plant\u2019s capacity and electricity to Respondent EDC for a 20 to 25-year term.\n\n47.\n\nIn July 1995, BHA, a Delaware corporation, was invited by the Prime Minister of Cambodia to participate in a competitive bidding process and submitted an application in response to EDC\u2019s request for proposals.\n\n48.\n\nAt this time, EDC was a department within MIME. EDC was therefore part of the Government of KOC.\n\n49.\n\nIn late 1995, BHA was selected as winner of the tender. BHA, KOC and EDC then negotiated the legal documentation for the investment by BHA into the Cambodian state power industry, which later resulted in two main agreements, the PPA and the IA, as well as numerous annexed forms of other agreements to be entered into at various stages of the project.\n\n50.\n\nOn 9 March 1996, a Royal Decree declared the establishment of a new EDC. KOC transformed EDC into a state-owned limited liability enterprise duly organized and validly existing under the laws of KOC. Following this change, the rights and obligations which were those of the old EDC were diluted between the new EDC and a newly created state agency: the Electricity Authority of Cambodia (\"**EAC**\"). The new EDC remained fully owned by KOC which was also empowered to appoint its board of directors.\n\n51.\n\nThe PPA and IA were signed on 20 March 1996. The PPA was signed by BHA, KOC and EDC. However, EDC was not a party to the IA which was entered into only by BHA and KOC. The PPA contained an arbitration clause providing for an arbitration administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (\"**ICC**\") in case of a dispute. By contrast, the IA contained an arbitration clause providing for ICSID arbitration, or, as a default forum, for ICC arbitration if ICSID arbitration was not available.\n\n52.\n\nAs understood by the parties to those contracts, BHA subsequently formed the Claimant (CPC) as a limited liability project company under Cambodian law, and on 5 June and 30 September 1996, KOC, EDC, BHA and CPC entered into two Novation Agreements (\"**Novation Agreements**\") substituting CPC for BHA in the IA and PPA respectively.\n\n53.\n\nOn 9 October 1998, KOC, EDC and CPC amended the PPA (\"**PPA Amendment No. 1**\"). This included an amendment to the dispute resolution clause of the PPA, to provide for ICSID arbitration or, similarly to the provision contained in the IA, for ICC arbitration, if ICSID arbitration was not available. This ICSID arbitration clause was drafted in similar terms, albeit with some differences (the importance of those differences is contested), to the ICSID arbitration clause contained in the IA. Under this amendment, the new EDC joined the PPA as a party replacing the old EDC.\n\n54.\n\nMIME, as a ministry of KOC, executed PPA Amendment No.1 for and on behalf of KOC. According to PPA\u00a716.3(b)(iii)(A) as amended by PPA Amendment No.1:\n\n*\"MIME agrees to procure that the Kingdom of Cambodia... notifies the Centre that it has designated each of MIME and EDC as a subdivision or agency of the Kingdom of Cambodia which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Centre for the purpose of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\"*\n\n55.\n\nIn fact, KOC never notified the Centre of the designation -if any- of EDC as its agency for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n56.\n\nOn 27 March 1998, the DOG was signed between KOC (Ministry of Economy and Finance, \"**MoEF**\") and CPC. The DOG contains an arbitration clause similar to the one contained in the IA.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant contends that from 1998 to 2004, KOC and EDC repeatedly and deliberately breached their contractual obligations. As a result, CPC was not able to build the power plant, and finally decided to accept KOC\u2019s and EDC\u2019s repudiation of the project contracts. Such alleged repudiation is said to have caused CPC to lose its entire investment and the benefit of its bargain.\n\n58.\n\nOn 20 December 2004, KOC ratified the ICSID Convention, which entered into force in Cambodia on 19 January 2005.\n\n59.\n\nOn 30 July 2009, the Claimant commenced this arbitration by submitting its Request to the ICSID Centre.\n\n**V. THE DISPUTE IN BRIEF**\n---------------------------\n\n**VI. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------\n\n63.\n\nIn its most recent request for relief, the Claimant requests the Tribunal to dismiss all the preliminary objections of the Respondents heard in this bifurcated proceeding, and to award the following additional and/or other relief:\n\n(a) Declare that the claims under the PPA, IA and DOG are properly brought in this proceeding;\n\n(b) As an alternative, declare that claims under each of the PPA, IA and DOG are claims over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction in multiple parallel proceedings and order those proceedings to proceed to the merits phase on the already-agreed timetable;\n\n(c) As a further alternative, if the Tribunal decides that multiple claims are not permissible in the same proceeding, then afford the Claimant the choice of which claims to continue in this proceeding and which to voluntarily dismiss without prejudice to bringing such claims in another proceeding, and order the remaining claims to proceed on the already-agreed timetable;\n\n(d) Declare that EDC is an agency of the Kingdom of Cambodia within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention;\n\n(e) Declare that EDC has been designated to the ICSID Centre by KOC;\n\n(f) And therefore declare that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over EDC;\n\n(g) Declare that Claimant\u2019s claims against KOC under the DOG are properly brought and within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and fully admissible;\n\n(h) As an alternative, admit the claims against KOC under the DOG as additional claims under Article 46 of the Convention;\n\n(i) Declare that Claimant\u2019s claims against KOC based on state responsibility under principles of customary international law are properly brought and within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and fully admissible;\n\n(j) As an alternative, admit the claims against KOC under the state responsibility doctrine as additional claims under Article 46 of the Convention;\n\n(k) Order Respondents to pay all of the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Claimant in responding to their preliminary objections; and/or\n\n(l) Decide such further issues, make such further or alternative declarations, orders and awards, and grant such other and further relief as may be just or proper.\n\n64.\n\nIn its most recent request for relief, the Respondents request the Tribunal:\n\n(a) As regards the objection to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *rationae personae* over EDC:\n\na. to declare that EDC has not been designated to the ICSID Centre by KOC;\n\nb. further or alternatively, to declare that EDC is not an agency of KOC within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention;\n\nc. to find that it has no jurisdiction over EDC; and\n\nd. to dismiss all claims made against EDC.\n\n(b) As regards the objection to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over claims under more than one agreement:\n\na. To declare that claims under the PPA, the IA and the DOG ought to have been brought in separate proceedings; and\n\nb. To dismiss all of CPC\u2019s claims in these proceedings.\n\n(c) As regards the objection to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over claims under the DOG, and to the admissibility of such claims:\n\na. to declare that CPC\u2019s claim under the DOG is a new claim that does not fall within its jurisdiction;\n\nb. alternatively, to declare that CPC\u2019s claim under the DOG is inadmissible for failure to comply with the requirements of Article 46 of the Convention; and\n\nc. to dismiss CPC\u2019s claim under the DOG.\n\n(d) As regards the objection to the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over claims under principles of customary international law, and to the admissibility of the same:\n\na. to declare that CPC\u2019s claims under principles of customary international law are new claims that do not fall within its jurisdiction;\n\nb. alternatively, to declare that CPC\u2019s claims under principles of customary international law are inadmissible for failure to comply with the requirements of Article 46 of the Convention; and\n\nc. to dismiss CPC\u2019s claims under principles of customary international law;\n\n(e) To order the Claimant to pay all of the costs and expenses incurred by the Respondents in defending against the Claimant\u2019s claims, including, but not limited to, the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses, the fees and expenses of the Respondents\u2019 counsel, and interest, on a full indemnity basis.\n\n**VII. ISSUES FOR DETERMINATION**\n---------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Parties requested the Tribunal to consider the following issues:\n\n(a) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to decide claims arising out of the three separate agreements, namely the PPA, the IA and the DOG, in a single proceeding?\n\n(b) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction *rationae personae* over EDC?\n\n(c) Was EDC properly designated to the Centre as an agency of KOC within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention?\n\n(d) Does the designation requirement of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention require some form of communication to the Centre?\n\n(e) If yes, what type of communication is acceptable within the meaning of the Convention?\n\n(f) If yes, must such communication be made exclusively by the Contracting State itself?\n\n(g) Is EDC an agency of Cambodia for the purpose of Article 25 of the Convention?\n\n(h) Are the Respondents estopped from arguing that EDC is not an agency of KOC and/or that EDC has not been designated to the Centre as required by Article 25(1) of the Convention?\n\n(i) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to decide claims arising out of the DOG?\n\n(j) Did the Claimant need to identify the relevant consent instrument, i.e. the DOG, and indicate that a claim was made in respect of the DOG in the Request for Arbitration?\n\n(k) If yes, did the Claimant identify the DOG as a consent instrument in the Request for Arbitration?\n\n(l) If yes, did the Claimant properly articulate a claim under the DOG in the Request for Arbitration?\n\n(m) If no, can a claim under the DOG be admitted at a later stage under Article 46 of the Convention?\n\n(n) Did the Claimant properly and sufficiently articulate a claim under customary international law in the Request for Arbitration?\n\n(o) If no, can customary international law claims be admitted under Article 46 of the Convention as additional claims after the Request for Arbitration is filed?\n\n**VIII. ARGUMENTS AND DECISION**\n--------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider the above issues on a step-by-step basis.\n\n**A. TRIBUNAL\u2019S JURISDICTION OVER CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE PPA, IA AND DOG BROUGHT IN A SINGLE PROCEEDING**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe fundamental disagreement between the Parties, simply put, is whether or not there was any intention for claims arising out of separate contracts to be consolidated, or the subject of concurrent arbitral proceedings, or whether claims under each agreement could only be heard and determined by separate tribunals in separate arbitral proceedings.\n\n**1. CLAIMANT\u2019S POSITION**\n--------------------------\n\n**a. The negotiations of the contracts and the wording of the PPA, IA and DOG demonstrate the Parties\u2019 intention to consider the agreements as part of a unitary project, and to have a single proceeding in case of dispute**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimant contends that when BHA negotiated the transaction with the Cambodian state, the Parties both agreed to model the transaction documents on those previously used in an IPP in Pakistan. This was the reason why the Parties negotiated two different agreements, i.e. the PPA and the IA, but both formed part of a single transaction for the implementation of a single project.\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimant supports its assertion through the witness statement of Mr. Garrett, who testified that:\n\n*\"[i]n the end, both sides agreed that we would be better off with the two-document framework purely as a matter of convenience and efficiency.\"*\n\n70.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the negotiations and drafting history support an inference that the Parties saw all the agreements (including the DOG) as part of one, unified transaction.\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimant submits that as a result of this understanding that there was a single project articulated through separate contracts, the project agreements were drafted and executed as an interrelated set of obligations among CPC, KOC and EDC, and were meant to be read, interpreted, and enforced together in a single proceeding against both KOC and EDC.\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that KOC and EDC expressly agreed and consented in the PPA that that contract and the IA, together with the DOG, constituted a single \"*understanding*\" among all three Parties, and should be interpreted and enforced together. For instance, Section 21.2 of the PPA provides that both it and the IA:\n\n*\"together represent the entire understanding between the Parties in relation to the subject matter therein.\"*\n\n73.\n\nA similar clause is included at Section 14.2 of the IA:\n\n*\"[t]his Agreement and the [PPA] represents the entire understanding between the parties in relation to the subject matter therein\".*\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the fact that each of the PPA and IA contains this provision mirroring the other confirms that it was clearly the Parties\u2019 intention to have a unity of agreements.\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the three agreements were drafted as a suite of related agreements in such a way that it would be impossible to interpret or enforce any of them without reference to the others. In fact, so the Claimant argues, the documents must inherently be considered as one understanding, in order for there to have been valid consideration for their performance. Many obligations of KOC and EDC under each agreement can only be determined by reference to the performance or non-performance of obligations under the other agreements.\n\n76.\n\nIn support of this argument, the Claimant relies upon, among others, certain cross-default provisions in each of the agreements, as follows:\n\n(a) Section 15.2(a) of the PPA, which refers to \"default by the Royal Government of Cambodia in the making of any payment in accordance with the terms of the Government Guarantee of Payments [i.e. the DOG].\"\n\n(b) Schedule 1 of the PPA, which defines the Government Guarantee of Payments as having *\"the meaning ascribed thereto in the [IA].\"*\n\n(c) Section 15.2(d) of the PPA, which refers to \"any Change-in-Law which makes invalid, unenforceable or void any material undertaking of EDC or [KOC] under this agreement or the [IA].\"\n\n(d) Section 15.2(g) of the PPA, which refers to an event of default by KOC having \"occurred under the [IA] giving rise to the Company\u2019s right to terminate the [IA].\"\n\n(e) Section 10.2(a) of the IA, which refers to circumstances in which *\"EDC commits any material breach of the [PPA].\"*\n\n(f) Section 10.2(b) of the IA, which refers to \"default by the Royal Government of [KOC] in making any payment due and payable in accordance with the Government Guarantee of Payments [i.e. the DOG].\"\n\n(g) Section 1.1 of the DOG, which states that KOC \"irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees and promises to pay [CPC] any and every sum of money which is due and owing by EDC to [CPC] under or pursuant to the [PPA] that EDC has failed to pay in accordance with the terms of the [PPA].\"\n\n77.\n\nThe Claimant also cites other provisions of the PPA and the IA which contain intertwined rights and obligations of EDC, MIME (KOC) and CPC under the PPA, the IA and the DOG:\n\n(a) Section 3.6 of the PPA, which states that the Required Commercial Operations Date was to be extended in the case of certain delays, including those resulting from *\"any breach of contract or default by [EDC] under this Agreement [the PPA] or by MIME under the [IA]\".*\n\n(b) Section 14.2 of the PPA, which sets out representations and warranties given jointly and severally in the PPA by both KOC and EDC.\n\n(c) Section 1.1(a) of the IA, which states all expressions used in the IA that were defined in the PPA shall have their PPA meanings.\n\n(d) Section 2.2 of the IA, which ties the IA to the PPA, providing for automatic termination of the IA, if the PPA should terminate on account of the Effective Date not having occurred.\n\n(e) Section 5 of the IA, which links Claimant\u2019s PPA obligations with the IA and KOC\u2019s IA obligations, providing that *\"subject to [Claimant] complying with [its PPA obligations to apply for government consents]\"*, KOC agrees to perform its main IA obligations.\n\n78.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that Common Law jurisdictions have looked to interrelated \"*entire agreement*\" clauses as evidence that two agreements comprise a single, unitary transaction. In support of this argument, the Claimant cites *Inveresk plc v Tullis Russell Papermakers Ltd* [2009] UKSC 19 *(\"**Inveresk**\")*, where the UK Supreme Court found that, under Scottish law, obligations arising out of two separate agreements depended *\"upon one another and as each forming part of the same transaction.\"*\n\n79.\n\nThe Court added that:\n\n*\"[t]he true significance of these agreements [wa]s to be found in the respects in which they were each linked expressly with each other.\"*\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimant also cites *684733 Alberta Ltd. v. Money\u2019s Mushrooms Ltd.* [2003] B.C.J. No. 2475 *(\"**Alberta**\")*, where the Supreme Court of British Columbia decided that a share purchase agreement and a convertible promissory note were to be read together as one agreement since they were *\"executed contemporaneously with each other.\"*\n\n81.\n\nWith regard to the DOG, the Claimant refers to the second witness statement of Mr. Garrett, which articulates a practical reason as to why the guarantee was not provided in March 1996, i.e. at the same time that the PPA and the IA were signed. According to the Claimant, the budget approval of the Cambodian National Assembly was required, but had not yet been obtained. It was not therefore possible to sign the DOG on 20 March 1996. However, once signed, the DOG thus became integrated with the PPA and IA as an element of the single understanding of the Parties.\n\n**b. The similar wording of the arbitration clauses of the IA and of the PPA, as amended on 9 October 1998, demonstrates the Parties\u2019 intention to hear claims under a single proceeding**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the similarity of Section 6 of the IA and Section 16(3) of the PPA, as amended by PPA Amendment No. 1, is evidence that the Parties positively saw the two agreements as providing a single dispute resolution mechanism.\n\n83.\n\nIndeed, at the time of signature of the IA and the PPA, the latter contained no ICSID clause. The introduction of an ICSID arbitration clause in PPA Amendment No. 1 supports an inference that the Parties thereby brought the IA and PPA into line in order to harmonize their provisions, thereby allowing disputes to be heard in a single proceeding (i.e. an ICSID arbitration).\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the variations between the dispute resolution clause of the PPA, as amended by PPA Amendment No. 1, and the dispute resolution clauses of the IA and the DOG, concern no more than minor details, and do not contradict the Parties\u2019 intention to have potential claims heard in a single proceeding. It is the Claimant\u2019s assertion that these differences reflect poor drafting, as opposed to an intention to avoid consolidation, or a single proceeding for a dispute involving claims under the PPA, the IA and/or the DOG.\n\n**c. ICSID practice and Common Law jurisdictions support the consolidation of the proceedings under the present circumstances**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, previous ICSID tribunals have interpreted parties\u2019 consent to jurisdiction in one agreement such as to cover related agreements, when such agreements collectively encompass one unified investment, and such analyses have found support with commentators.\n\n86.\n\nIn *Noble Energy Inc. and Machalapower Cia. Ltda. v The Republic of Ecuador and Consejo Nacional de Electricidad, ICSID Case No. ARB/5/12, Decision on Jurisdiction (5 March 2008)* (\"***Noble Energy***\"), the tribunal found that it had jurisdiction over disputes arising out of multiple agreements where there was \"an implied consent to have the pending disputes arising from the same overall economic transaction resolved in one and the same arbitration.\" The tribunal relied upon the fact that (1) the disputes were closely related and arose out of the same investment project, and the same overall economic transaction, and (2) that the two main agreements were themselves closely linked. The Claimant contends that these two elements are also present in the instant dispute. Therefore, following the Noble Energy reasoning, the Tribunal should find it has jurisdiction over claims under the PPA, the IA and the DOG, and that those claims can be heard in a single proceeding.\n\n87.\n\nIn *Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH, Klockner Belge SA and Klockner Handelsmaatschappij BV v United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais, ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Award (21 Oct. 1983) (\"**Kl\u00f6ckner**\"),* the tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction to hear disputes arising under two agreements in a single proceeding (but not under a third). Although there was no cross-referred dispute settlement clause, the separate agreements referred disputes arising under each to ICSID arbitration, as is the case in the present dispute.\n\n88.\n\nIn *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Ouest Africaine des B\u00e9tons Industriels v Senegal, ICSID Case No. ARB/82/1, Award (25 February 1988)* (\"***SOABI***\"), the tribunal found that a construction contract formed part of another contract, on the basis of an analysis of the relevant agreements as a whole. In *SOABI*, so the Claimant observes, the construction contract lacked an ICSID arbitration clause. In contrast, in the instant case, all the agreements in question provide for ICSID jurisdiction. Therefore, according to the Claimant, in the instant case there is better cause to conclude that the Parties intended to have claims arising out of separate agreements heard in a single proceeding. In addition, in *SOABI*, the main agreement did not make explicit reference to rights and obligations under the construction contract. The Claimant asserts that in the present case, the PPA, the IA and the DOG are explicitly, repeatedly and extensively interconnected. That makes the instant case a more compelling one for a finding that the Parties\u2019 intended to have claims arising out of these contracts heard in the same arbitration.\n\n89.\n\nIn *Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a.s. v The Slovak Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (24 May 1999)* (\"***CSOB***\"), the tribunal saw its task as finding the \"common will of the parties.\" This common will was reflected in one of the agreements which specifically referred to \"a court of competent jurisdiction.\" In the present case, all agreements contain ICSID clauses. On the basis of the approach in CSOB (albeit differently to the facts of that case), the Claimant argued that this leaves room for an inference that the Parties intended an ICSID arbitration to deal with their claims under these agreements, by a single tribunal, in one proceeding.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that under English law there is a presumption that the Parties intended their disputes to be heard in a single forum. The Claimant supports this assertion by citing two English cases.\n\n91.\n\nIn *Premium Nafta Products Ltd and others v Fili Shipping Co Ltd and others* [2007] UKHL 40 (\"***Premium Nafta***\"), the House of Lords held that there was a presumption that an arbitration clause in a main contract also governed claims regarding the validity or enforceability of an underlying contract \"*unless the language makes it clear that certain questions were intended to be excluded from the arbitrator\u2019s jurisdiction.*\"\n\n92.\n\nIn *UBS AG v HAS Nordbank AG,* [2009] EWCA Civ 585 (\"***UBS AG***\"), the Court of Appeal held that sensible business people would not have intended that a dispute of this kind would have been within the scope of two inconsistent jurisdiction agreements. The Court found that the agreements were all connected and part of one package.\n\n93.\n\nIn light of all these cases, as there is no express language that could contradict the principle of consolidation, or concurrent proceedings, the Claimant contends that claims under the PPA, the IA and the DOG should be heard in a single proceeding.\n\n**2. RESPONDENTS\u2019 POSITION**\n----------------------------\n\n**a. The absence of express consolidation provisions in the PPA, the IA and the DOG demonstrates the Parties\u2019 intention to have separate proceedings in case of dispute**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nRespondents submit that claims arising out of the PPA, the IA and the DOG cannot be brought in one single proceeding since the Parties have not consented to a single tribunal having jurisdiction over all of them. The Tribunal can only take jurisdiction over claims arising out of more than one agreement if this is the Parties\u2019 intention. In the present case, it was never the intention of the Parties to have claims arising under different instruments heard in the same proceeding.\n\n95.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the arbitration clauses are plain on their face: each vests an arbitral tribunal with jurisdiction over disputes arising solely under that agreement, and does not cover disputes arising under either of the other agreements. The Respondents contend that the dispute resolution clause in each agreement is limited, by clear and unequivocal terms, to disputes arising out of each specific agreement, and the clauses do not contemplate the resolution of disputes under separate agreements in a single proceeding:\n\n(a) Article 12 of the IA defines an arbitrable dispute as one:\n\n*\"aris[ing] out of or in connection with this Agreement\".*\n\n(b) Article 7.2 of the DOG defines a dispute as:\n\n*\"any dispute or difference aris[ing] out of or in connection with this Agreement.\"*\n\n(c) Article 16.1 of the PPA also defines a dispute as a:\n\n*\"dispute or difference... between EDC and [CPC] in connection with or arising out of this Agreement.\"*\n\n96.\n\nThe Respondents accept the Claimant\u2019s argument that the three agreements were \"*carefully drafted*\", but the Respondents emphasise that the Parties nevertheless took great care not to include any provision for consolidation in any of them. This fact shows conclusively that the Parties did not intend disputes under more than one of the agreements to be heard together.\n\n**b. Significant differences in the arbitration clauses of the PPA, the IA and the DOG demonstrate the Parties\u2019 intention not to have a consolidated arbitration**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the Parties\u2019 intention not to have claims arising under the PPA, the IA and the DOG heard together can be ascertained from the words of the arbitration clauses of the various agreements, which are materially different. The Respondents submit that such differences are obvious not only in the original arbitration clause of the PPA signed on 20 March 1996, but also in the arbitration clause of the PPA signed on 9 October 1998, when both are compared to the arbitration clauses of the IA and the DOG.\n\n**(i) The negotiations of the agreements and the final wording of the arbitration clauses demonstrate the Parties\u2019 intention to exclude any consolidation in case of dispute**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the initial versions of the arbitration clauses of the PPA, IA, and DOG were potentially incompatible, as the PPA only provided for ICC arbitration whereas the IA and the DOG provided for ICSID arbitration on Cambodia\u2019s ratification of the Convention. Therefore, it is clear that from the outset, the Parties contemplated different *fora* in case of disputes brought under the several agreements.\n\n99.\n\nIndeed, Article 16.3 of the PPA, as executed on 20 March 1996, provided only for dispute resolution in accordance with the ICC Rules, with no alternative forum. By contrast, the IA, as executed on the same day as the PPA, provided for ICSID arbitration or, if ICSID arbitration was not available, ICC arbitration. The same is true for the DOG, which was signed on 27 March 1998, at which time the PPA still only referred to ICC arbitration.\n\n100.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the consent to ICSID arbitration was therefore never part of the bargain, as there was no ICSID arbitration clause in the PPA in 1996; and although there was a provision in the IA and the DOG for ICSID arbitration, it was subject to Cambodia\u2019s ratification of the Convention. Therefore it was never the Parties\u2019 intention that proceedings brought under the PPA, the IA and the DOG would be brought in a single proceeding since the arbitration clauses were incompatible.\n\n**(ii) The wording of the PPA\u2019s arbitration clause signed on 9 October 1998 demonstrates the Parties\u2019 intention to exclude any consolidation in case of dispute**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondents maintain that the Parties\u2019 intention not to have claims under the PPA, the IA and the DOG heard in a single proceeding can be deduced from the Parties\u2019 intentional omission of any consolidation provision, or the insertion of an identical dispute resolution clause, when the PPA was amended on 9 October 1998.\n\n102.\n\nPPA Amendment No. 1 amended the dispute-resolution clause to provide for ICSID arbitration, with the default forum remaining ICC arbitration. Thus, although the Parties had the opportunity to insert consolidation clauses in their agreement or, at the very least, to include identical arbitration clauses at that stage, they did not do so. According to the Respondents, this is further proof that, not only in March 1996, but also in October 1998, the Parties neither intended that disputes under the three agreements be heard in a single proceeding, nor consented in advance to consolidated proceedings.\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the dispute-resolution clause in the PPA (as amended) is materially different from the dispute-resolution clauses contained in the IA and the DOG, and that they are incompatible.\n\n104.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the significant variations in the various clauses relate to:\n\n(a) The procedure for appointment of a single arbitrator;\n\n(b) The procedure for appointment of the presiding arbitrator;\n\n(c) The qualifications of the arbitrators;\n\n(d) The need to have certified translations of documents not in English;\n\n(e) That the arbitrators shall be bound by the decision of the \"Expert\";\n\n(f) That the parties may publicise or disclose the contents of any award;\n\n(g) That the award shall be in dollars; and\n\n(h) An express waiver of all provisions of Cambodian law which may be inconsistent with Article 16 of the PPA\n\n**c. ICSID practice does not support consolidation of arbitration proceedings when there is no consent to consolidate and when the arbitration clauses are materially different**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondents contend that neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Arbitration Rules provide for proceedings under separate agreements, governed by separate arbitration clauses, to be brought in a single proceeding. ICSID practice is to appoint identical tribunals for separate but related claims, but only with the Parties\u2019 consent. In support of their assertion, the Respondents cite Schreuer:\n\n*\"these cases remain exceptional since - in the absence of an express provision in the relevant treaty - consolidation requires the consent of the parties and this cannot always be easily achieved.\" (C Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (2nd ed., 2009) (ICSID Commentary) \u00a726-131)*\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondents maintain that the only potential basis upon which this Tribunal might assume jurisdiction over the three distinct contracts under which CPC\u2019s claims arise is therefore the Parties\u2019 intention itself, which to some extent can be derived from the circumstances. However, the Respondents deny the Claimant\u2019s interpretation of several ICSID cases upon which they rely.\n\n107.\n\nIn *Noble Energy (supra)*, while the tribunal concluded that it had jurisdiction over disputes arising out of three different instruments, this decision was premised on the finding that there was *\"an implied consent to have the pending disputes arising from the same overall economic transaction resolved in one and the same arbitration.\"* Importantly, this implied consent was based on several decisive factors, a number of which are not present in the instant case.\n\n108.\n\nIn *Klockner (supra)*, the tribunal only assumed jurisdiction over a contract (*Establishment Agreement*) and a second agreement (*Protocol of Agreement*), which both contained an ICSID arbitration clause. However, the tribunal in that case did not assume jurisdiction over another contract (*Management Contract*) which contained an ICC clause.\n\n109.\n\nIn *SOABI (supra)*, four successive agreements were entered into by the parties. Only one of these agreements (*Establishment Agreement*) contained a dispute-resolution clause, referring to ICSID arbitration. The Claimant brought proceedings under two separate agreements. The tribunal assumed jurisdiction under the two agreements as they were:\n\n*\"of necessity incorporated into the [Establishment Agreement]\", and \"therefore... the disputes relating to their execution or to the rights and obligations arising thereunder fall within the scope of [the arbitration clause] of the Establishment Agreement.\"*\n\n110.\n\nHowever, the Respondents submit that the circumstances in that case materially differ from those of the instant case. Unlike the present case, in *SOABI:*\n\n(a) the respondent was a party to all the agreements, as was the claimant;\n\n(b) the incorporated agreements did not contain any dispute-resolution clause; and\n\n(c) the incorporating agreement (the Establishment Agreement) was deemed to incorporate the other two agreements.\n\n111.\n\nThe Respondents contend that in the present case, not only are the PPA and the IA not between the same parties, they also each impose precise and distinct obligations on EDC (the PPA), MIME (the IA) and the MoEF (the DOG).\n\n112.\n\nIn *CSOB (supra)*, the tribunal did not assume jurisdiction over other agreements pertaining to the wider investment operation. In its second decision on jurisdiction, and referring to its earlier finding, the tribunal forcefully stated that even though the first decision held that *CSOB*\u2019s claims related to another loan facility could qualify as part of the investment, this did:\n\n*\"not mean, however, that the Tribunal thereby automatically acquires jurisdiction with regard to each agreement concluded to implement the wider investment operation. Other requirements have to be met for such jurisdiction to be established.\"*\n\n113.\n\nIn *Duke Energy (supra)*, a \"*legal stability agreement*\" between the claimant and Peru contained an ICSID arbitration clause. The parties had entered into a series of other legal stability agreements with Peru which did not contain ICSID arbitration clauses. The tribunal made a finding regarding the qualification of the investment; however, it stated that it would not entertain any claims arising out of those other contracts and transactions. The tribunal added that:\n\n*\"in the peculiar circumstances of this case (successive agreements for the protection of the investment), the unity of the investment does not necessarily imply the unity of the protection of the investment.\"*\n\n114.\n\nThe Respondents contend that this decision makes clear that, while the broader arrangements made in relation to an investment may be taken into consideration in finding a qualifying \"investment\", or in determining a breach of a treaty, the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal is limited to the particular agreement which contains the relevant arbitration agreement.\n\n115.\n\nIn *Holiday Inns v Morocco, ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (12 May 1974)* (\"***Holiday Inns***\"), the tribunal agreed that questions arising out of loan contracts, that had been concluded in the context of a main agreement containing an ICSID arbitration clause and which themselves contained choice-of-court clauses, were within the jurisdiction of the local courts - even if these questions *\"affect[ed] the indirect or secondary aspects of the investment*. \" The tribunal thus did not \"hear a dispute\" under the loan contracts; quite the opposite. It gave due deference to the jurisdiction of the local courts over disputes arising out of the loan contracts, while at the same time fully assuming its own jurisdiction over disputes based on a contract containing an arbitration clause.\n\n**d. The three agreements are not so interrelated that they cannot be heard separately**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Respondents contend that while there are indeed cross-references to the PPA in the IA and vice-versa, a tribunal having jurisdiction over the PPA need not have jurisdiction over the IA to take the latter into account as a fact, to the extent necessary, and vice-versa. The PPA and the IA are therefore capable of being enforced on their own. This is all the more so with respect to the DOG, which can only be called upon once an award against EDC has been made.\n\n**3. TRIBUNAL\u2019S DECISION**\n--------------------------\n\n117.\n\nOn 16 September 2009, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered this arbitration as a single proceeding as presented, notwithstanding that the Request for Arbitration (according to the Claimant) embodied claims under each of the PPA, the IA and the DOG.\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondents\u2019 principal objection is not to the determination of claims arising out of the PPA, the IA and the DOG by this Tribunal, in ICSID arbitration. There is, for example, no issue that each contract contains a valid ICSID arbitration clause; that three separate Requests for Arbitration could have been filed by the Claimant (one for each agreement); and that this Tribunal could have been constituted in each of the three separate arbitral proceedings. Rather, the Respondents\u2019 complaint is to the determination of claims under each of these agreements at the same time, in a single proceeding. According to the Respondents, the joining together of all claims in a single Request for Arbitration is impermissible, and itself has the effect of depriving this Tribunal of jurisdiction for all such claims.\n\n119.\n\nIt is clear that the decision of the Secretary-General to register a single arbitral proceeding does not bind this Tribunal, which has to consider the jurisdictional arguments raised *de novo*.\n\n120.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, in the circumstances of this case the Tribunal disagrees with the Respondents\u2019 analysis.\n\n**a. Relevant principles governing consolidation of claims in ICSID proceedings**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) Consent**\n---------------\n\n121.\n\nThe uncontroversial starting point is that the consolidation of claims in ICSID arbitration (as with most other systems) depends upon the consent of the parties. Such consent may be established before or after the dispute has arisen. Absent consent, the fundamental principle of party autonomy dictates that claims under multiple contracts may not be consolidated, however inconvenient and inefficient that result may be.\n\n122.\n\nWhilst such consent usually takes the form of an express provision, whether in a contract or Treaty; by way of incorporated arbitration rules; or in a submission agreement; it can also be implied from the circumstances.\n\n123.\n\nThe various ICSID decisions that have been deployed by the Parties (as noted earlier) are significant in this regard, since they emphasise the need to interpret the parties\u2019 intentions in light of all the circumstances of each case. In the absence of an express provision on consolidation, the intentions of the parties remains the critical test in determining whether or not claims arising out of different agreements are to be heard together.\n\n124.\n\nFor example, in *SOABI (supra)* the tribunal held that:\n\n*\"the interpretation must take into account the consequences which the parties must reasonably and legitimately be considered to have envisaged as flowing from the undertakings. It is this principle of interpretation, rather than one of priori strict, or, for that matter, broad and liberal construction, that the Tribunal has chosen to apply.\"*\n\n125.\n\nIn *CSOB (supra)*, the tribunal found that its task was to determinate the \"*common will of the parties*\" and held that, in doing so, \"*each case must be assessed by reference to its specific facts*\".\n\n126.\n\nSimilarly, in *Noble Energy (supra)* the tribunal\u2019s conclusion that it had jurisdiction over disputes arising out of multiple agreements was premised upon \"*an implied consent to have the pending disputes arising from the same overall economic transaction resolved in one and the same arbitration*\", such implied consent having been deduced from a number of factors related to the purpose and configuration of the agreements in question.\n\n**(ii) The Precise Type of \"Consolidation\"**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nEstablishing requisite consent entails, however, a further level of analysis, namely identifying the precise mechanism by which it has been agreed that claims be coordinated. Whilst it is clear that ICSID tribunals have accepted jurisdiction in a number of previous cases, where a single proceeding has been commenced and registered, arising out of more than one, albeit connected, agreement, such cases in fact span a number of different situations, and it is important to distinguish between them.\n\n128.\n\nIn particular, parties may agree that disputes arising out of multiple contracts are all to be brought within the scope of one particular arbitration agreement in one of the contracts. Alternatively, separate arbitration clauses in separate agreements might be interpreted as, in truth, one single arbitration agreement. Further still, claims under multiple contracts might be merged into one arbitration proceeding, and determined by way of one award. Alternatively, separate arbitration proceedings arising out of separate arbitration agreements might be heard and determined concurrently (i.e. synchronised), whilst maintaining a separate juridical nature. Whilst all of these variations might be described as \"consolidation\", each is obviously different in nature.\n\n**b. The Parties\u2019 implied consent in this case**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nDuring the Hearing, the Tribunal pressed the Claimant to clarify the precise mechanism by which the Parties had agreed that all claims could be heard in a single proceeding.\n\n130.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal suggested (by way of example - and without limitation) the three following *scenarii* (T/day1/p156/4-22; p160/1-16):\n\n(a) Consent for the Claimant to activate one arbitration agreement under one of the contracts, and to bring within its scope claims that arise under the two other contracts;\n\n(b) Each of the arbitration clauses in the PPA, the IA and the DOG, in truth, constituting (as a matter of fact and law) a single arbitration agreement between the Parties;\n\n(c) Consent for proceedings that arise out of three distinct arbitration agreements to be brought together before the same tribunal, through either consolidation or concurrent proceedings.\n\n131.\n\nOn day 2 of the Hearing, the Claimant clarified its position, arguing that scenario (b) above was \"*in perfect harmony with [its] pleadings*\" (T/day2/p75/l16-17), albeit if this could not be established, the Claimant then also relied upon the other possible analyses.\n\n132.\n\nHaving carefully considered all the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal finds no basis for scenario (b). This scenario seems far from the present situation, since the PPA, IA and DOG arbitration clauses were concluded separately, at different times, between different (albeit connected) parties, and each as a self-contained agreement, enforceable in its own right. The three clauses are not identical and do not refer to each other. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, scenario (b) presents an *a priori* consolidation by unification of the proceedings which can only happen in two cases. First, where each arbitration clause expressly refers to the others as forming a single arbitration clause and providing for a single arbitration. Second, where there is no such express reference, but an implied consent can be inferred, for example because all arbitration clauses are identical, were concluded in parallel, are dependent upon one another or otherwise interconnected, and included in contracts which are themselves interrelated and arising out of a single project. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the agreements in this case cannot comfortably be analysed in either of these ways.\n\n133.\n\nIt follows that each of the three arbitration clauses constitutes a separate agreement, which could be activated separately. Thus, there would be nothing in principle to prevent the Claimant from commencing an arbitration, and pursuing claims, under only one of the PPA, the IA or the DOG. Were the Claimant to seek instead to commence one \"*umbrella*\" arbitration raising claims under all three agreements, it could not do so in the absence of consent of the other Parties to the agreements. That consent would necessarily have to extend to an acknowledgement that, notwithstanding any asserted incompatibilities in the three discrete arbitration agreements, no objection predicated on such a basis was raised. Such consent might be express, but there is none in this case. Alternatively, it might be implied by reference to the Parties\u2019 conduct and/or by reference to their intentions as reflected in the terms of the PPA, the IA and the DOG. (See paragraphs 135-138 below).\n\n134.\n\nEqually, the Tribunal finds no basis for scenario (a) above. Each of the PPA, IA and DOG contains its own valid arbitration clause, with a defined scope. There is nothing in the arbitration clauses themselves, or in the wider circumstances of the Parties\u2019 arrangement, to suggest any consent that one arbitration clause take precedence over the other two. To this end, as the Respondents have argued, the presence of separate arbitration clauses in each contract in this case means that previous ICSID decisions in which one arbitration clause has been extended to cover multiple contracts are of no assistance here. It may be noted, in any event, that the Claimant in its Request for Arbitration purported to activate all the arbitration clauses in the relevant contracts, rather than relying upon just one.\n\n135.\n\nBut the fact that each arbitration clause constitutes a separate agreement does not answer the question whether, if a party elects to activate more than one of the arbitration agreements at or about the same time, that party is entitled to seek to co-ordinate or combine the several proceedings before a single tribunal.\n\n136.\n\nThat brings the Tribunal to scenario (c). With regard to this scenario, where multiple arbitration clauses have been separately activated, there are two options in coordinating the various proceedings, each option bearing different consequences. First, the separate proceedings flowing from each of the separate arbitration clauses might be merged into one proceeding, and heard and determined by a single tribunal in a single award. Secondly, the separate proceedings might be kept notionally separate, but with hearings and determinations synchronised, whether before a single or multiple tribunals, and usually by way of multiple awards (often termed: \"*concurrent proceedings*\" or \"*de facto* consolidation\").\n\n137.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the first of the two options accurately reflects the intentions of the Parties in this case.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal has already set out the competing arguments at some length when summarising the Parties\u2019 respective positions. Having considered all of them very carefully, and for the particular reasons elaborated below, the Tribunal concludes that the Parties in this case undoubtedly intended that there be an option to coordinate multiple proceedings. Specifically, where claims are brought by a party pursuant to more than one arbitration clause at or about the same time, the Parties clearly intended that the party in question should be entitled to combine the claims, in order that they be heard and determined before a single tribunal. Equally, the Tribunal is confident that in structuring their project contracts, the Parties never intended multiple, parallel proceedings arising out of the same dispute, with all the burdens and risks that this would entail, where this might practically be avoided.\n\n139.\n\nIt follows that the Claimant was entitled to commence proceedings under the PPA, IA and DOG at the same time by way of a single Request for Arbitration, and to compel the Respondents to appoint a single tribunal to hear and determine all such claims. The Tribunal notes, in this regard, that even if (contrary to the analysis above) the Respondents had been entitled to object to the constitution of the same tribunal for all claims, no such objection was actually raised in a timely fashion in this case in any event (see paras [ 162-4 ] below).\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion is based on the following factors:\n\n**(i) The three agreements all arise from a single investment for a single power project**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe agreements in this case all regulate aspects of a single project, and there exists a clear connectivity and interdependence between them. Any dispute arising out of the project would almost inevitably touch upon, and give rise to claims under, each agreement, and the Tribunal finds that the Parties\u2019 intention must have been to have such claims heard together, wherever possible.\n\n142.\n\nIn reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal has taken into account (*inter alia*) the drafting history of the agreements. The Tribunal accepts Mr. Garrett\u2019s testimony that the negotiations of the project led the Parties to model the transaction documents on those used in a successful IPP in Pakistan. It appears that the Parties structured the project through three separate agreements in order to attract potential lenders and as a matter of general efficiency. According to Mr. Garrett, consideration was given to combining the PPA and the IA in one single document. This option was later abandoned, because it would have resulted in an unreadable document which would have kept away any potential investor. Contrary to the Respondents\u2019 case, the fact that the project was structured by way of three contracts rather than one, therefore, had nothing to do with any motivated desire to have three separate arbitrations in the event of a dispute.\n\n143.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Respondents emphasised that the arbitration clause in each of the PPA, the IA and the DOG was drafted with a limited scope, and that this indicates an intention that claims under each contract be resolved separately.\n\n144.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with the Respondents\u2019 interpretation of the scope of each clause. In fact, each has a formulation which allows for a broad scope (e.g. \"*aris[ing] out of or in connection with*\" (Art 12 of the IA and Art 7.2 of the DOG); \"*in connection with or arising out of*\" (Art 16.1 of the PPA). Be that as it may, the Respondents\u2019 objection would only be relevant in any event if scenario (a) above had been in question (i.e. the activation of one arbitration agreement in one of the contracts, to cover claims under all of the contracts).\n\n145.\n\nOnce the precise form of coordination is identified, this objection falls away. Unlike scenario (a), the consolidation of claims (scenario (c)) entails the activation of each of the arbitration clauses (of whatever breadth), and the merger of the resultant arbitration proceedings. Even if each separate arbitration clause had been narrowly framed, the Tribunal does not consider that this negates the Parties\u2019 intention to consolidate the various proceedings themselves.\n\n146.\n\nIn addition, as the Claimant submits, both Section 21.2 and 14.2 of the PPA and IA respectively provide that they, *\" together[,] represent the entire understanding between the Parties in relation to the subject matter therein*.\" (emphasis added)\n\n147.\n\nThere is no doubt that by these provisions, the Parties\u2019 intention was to emphasise the unity of the investment under the separate agreements. The same intention dictates that, in case of dispute, those agreements would also be considered together as part of an indivisible project.\n\n**(ii) The three agreements contain cross-default provisions**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe agreements\u2019 cross-default provisions clearly demonstrate the Parties\u2019 intention that the claims arising out of the three agreements be heard together, wherever possible.\n\n149.\n\nThe Claimant emphasised at length the numerous cross-default provisions contained in the PPA, IA and DOG. These cross-default provisions show an interdependence of the Parties\u2019 rights and obligations. The Tribunal concludes that it would be impracticable to consider the rights and obligations of the Parties arising out of one agreement without considering at least one of the two other agreements, and that this impracticality must have been evident to the Parties at the time of contracting.\n\n150.\n\nIt is quite clear that the whole transaction could not have been implemented by way of one of the three agreements alone, and thus it is not surprising that the Respondents presented no evidence that the Parties ever had the intention to disconnect each agreement from the others.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the interdependence of the three agreements reflects the intention of the Parties that there be an option for related claims arising out of the agreements to be considered together.\n\n**(iii) The Parties\u2019 effort to reach similar arbitration clauses through amendments**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondents\u2019 case is that the differences in the arbitrations clauses of the PPA, IA and DOG demonstrate that the Parties did not intend to have their claims heard together.\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the initial PPA arbitration clause was clearly different from the IA and DOG clauses. However, in a conscious effort to unify and conform them, the Parties subsequently amended the PPA arbitration clause, with the obvious intention to have the same or very similar dispute resolution provisions in each of the three agreements.\n\n154.\n\nWhilst it is true that the three arbitration clauses prior to amendment were very different, this deliberate attempt to conform them is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, very significant, and sets this case apart from many others involving multiple contracts.\n\n155.\n\nFollowing the amendment, the several arbitration clauses were substantially the same, with the remaining differences being - in the Tribunal\u2019s judgment - insignificant (and certainly not such as to be incompatible in practice). Each of the three clauses provided for ICSID arbitration after ratification of the ICISD Convention by KOC, and ICC arbitration prior to ratification, or if ICSID arbitration was otherwise not possible. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant\u2019s contention that the minor variations that remained between the clauses were likely the result of poor drafting, rather than an unconditional desire of the Parties to have their claims heard by different tribunals in separate proceedings in case of a dispute.\n\n156.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal is satisfied that it could not have been the intention of the Parties, as prudent and reasonable organisations, and on the facts of this case, that any disputes arising out of this project should only be determined by different tribunals, with all the difficulties and risks that this would inevitably entail. On the contrary, the Parties took special steps to avoid this.\n\n**(iv) The use of a single Request to activate several arbitration clauses**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Respondents\u2019 objections also raise a distinct procedural question, namely whether the Claimant was entitled to activate the three arbitration clauses, and commence three concurrent arbitrations with the same Tribunal, by filing a single Request. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this is not a matter of jurisdiction subject to Article 25 of the Convention, but rather a matter relating to the conduct of the procedure covered by Article 44 of ICSID Convention.\n\n158.\n\nThe Tribunal notes and concurs with the following statement in the *Noble Energy* decision (*supra*):\n\n*\"Article 44 of the ICSID Convention provides that arbitration proceedings are governed by the Convention, and, unless the parties agree otherwise, by the ICSID Arbitration Rules. Whenever the ICSID Convention and Rules are silent on an issue \u2018the Tribunal shall decide the question\u2019 in the exercise of its general powers.\"*\n\n159.\n\nThe starting point of the Tribunal\u2019s consideration of this issue must be the Convention itself and the Arbitration Rules. There is nothing in either which expressly prohibits an investor using a single Request to commence ICSID arbitration proceedings pursuant to more than one arbitration agreement relating to the same project and involving a single investment. Therefore, the Tribunal must exercise its power in light of its own judgment.\n\n160.\n\nThe filing of a single Request in such cases may well facilitate the consolidation of proceedings before a single tribunal, and thereby achieve a fair, expeditious and cost-efficient resolution of the dispute. Investments often are in the form of complex financial structures which require the implementation of several agreements. It would be contrary to the spirit of the Convention to require claimants in each case to file as many requests for arbitration as they have claims arising under different agreements, particularly where such claims are clearly connected as in the present case. Not only would this be onerous, but it would also represent a considerable waste of time and costs, and could lead to potential delaying tactics, and inconsistent determinations. More importantly such an approach is not mandated by the Convention or by the Rules.\n\n161.\n\nClearly, if one Request is used to activate more than one arbitration agreement, this may or may not actually achieve consolidation in any particular case, depending upon whether the respondent agrees, or (as here) is found to have consented previously to a single proceeding before a single tribunal.\n\n162.\n\nIn this case, as set out above, the Claimant is entitled to consolidation before a single tribunal. The Tribunal notes in this regard that, as recorded in the Minutes of the hearing held on 9 April 2010 in The Hague, \"*the Parties confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and that they had no objection to any of its members.\"* Whereas it is clear that the Respondents at The Hague meeting foreshadowed the possibility of jurisdictional issues, they did not then state that the Tribunal was wrongly constituted, and nor would there have been a basis to assert this.\n\n163.\n\nSome six months after the Tribunal\u2019s constitution, the Respondents suggested for the first time that they objected to the Tribunal\u2019s constitution to arbitrate all claims together. Whilst this objection was not raised timeously, in light of the Tribunal\u2019s findings as to the Parties\u2019 implied consent, it must fail in any event.\n\n164.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant acted properly when it filed its Request which articulated claims under three separate agreements, i.e. the PPA, IA and DOG.\n\n**B. DOES THE TRIBUNAL HAVE JURISDICTION** ***RATIONAE PERSONAE*** **OVER EDC?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Was EDC properly designated to the Centre as an agency of KOC within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Claimant\u2019s Position:**\n---------------------------\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s position has varied on this issue.\n\n166.\n\nFirst, in its Request, the Claimant maintained that EDC was apparently an agency of KOC, but that, to its knowledge, KOC had never designated EDC to the Centre (Request \u00a740). As a response to a request for clarification made by ICSID, the Claimant stated that the designation requirement was satisfied because the KOC and EDC had consented to arbitration in the same clause and the communication of that consent had been made to ICSID through the submission of the Request (Supplement to Request).\n\n167.\n\nSecondly, in its Memorial on the Merits, the Claimant submitted that KOC had expressly designated EDC as an \"*agency*\" for purposes of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction, and that such designation was properly communicated to the Centre by CPC through the Request (Memorial on the Merits \u00a7134).\n\n168.\n\nFinally, in the Claimant\u2019s last submission, it argues that EDC was properly designated as an agency of KOC within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention. The Claimant contends that the designation requirement of Article 25(1) of the Convention does not require formal communication of the designation to the Centre. As an alternative, the Claimant says that if such communication is required by the Convention, it was properly effectuated by the Claimant when it submitted its Request to the Centre. In addition, the Claimant submits that the Respondents are estopped from arguing that EDC was not properly designated within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n**(i) Article 25(1) of the Convention does not require notification of the designation**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, once an entity has been designated as an agency, such designation does not require notification to the Centre. The Claimant argues that the term \"*notify*\" and its related forms clearly mean something different from the term \"*designate*\" and its related forms. In the case of \"*notify*,\" the action of communicating is the essence of the term. In the case of \"*designate*,\" the essence is in the selection, appointment or setting apart itself; any communication of that act is secondary, and may be made to one or more different persons depending on the context. In support of its argument, the Claimant cites the definition of the terms \"*designate*\" and \"*notify*\" of the *American Heritage Dictionary* and the *Black\u2019s Law Dictionary*.\n\n170.\n\nThe Claimant contends that since the Convention uses both the terms \"*designate*\" and \"*notify*\" in a number of instances with each concept having a distinct meaning from the other, Article 25(1) was specifically drafted not to include an element of notification. In support of its argument, the Claimant indentifies the Convention\u2019s use of \"*notify*\" referring to a formal communication made by a specified person to a specified person or persons, which can be compared to the Convention\u2019s use of \"*designate*.\" E.g.:\n\n(a) \"*Notify*\": Articles 28(3), 49, 66(1), 70, 71, 72 and 75;\n\n(b) \"*Designate*\": Articles 12, 13, 25(1), 52(3).\n\n171.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the use of the preposition \"*to*\" in the phrase \"*designated to the Centre*\" does not require an act of communication to the Centre. The term \"*to*\" in this instance points to the purpose for which the designation is made, i.e. pointing to the institution to which a person is designated. In this regard, the Claimant cites Mr. Aaron Broches, ICSID\u2019s first Secretary-General who chaired the Legal Committee on the Settlement of Investment Disputes, and concludes that nothing in Mr. Broches\u2019 summary of the purposes of the designation requirement suggests any communication to the Centre.\n\n172.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the interpretation of Article 25(1) by ICSID tribunals supports the view that formal communication of the designation to the Centre is not required.\n\n173.\n\nAccording to the Claimant there is a consistent interpretation of Article 25(1) by the Secretary-General such that the lack of direct notification to the Centre by a Contracting State of its designation of an agency does not put a claim outside the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n174.\n\nThe Claimant cites several cases where the Secretary-General registered a request for arbitration, and relies upon two of them in particular, in which tribunals accepted jurisdiction over a respondent agency where no prior notice of designation had been given to the Centre by the Contracting State.\n\n175.\n\nIn *Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company v Arab Republic of Egypt and the General Authority for Investment and Free Zones, ICSID Case No. ARB/89/1, Decision on the Jurisdiction and the Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and on Recommendation of Provisional Measures (6 June 1991)* (\"***Manufacturers Hanover***\") (unpublished but submitted in this case as a legal authority), there was no indication that the Arab Republic of Egypt, the Contracting State, had ever notified the Centre that it had designated GAIFZ as its agency. The tribunal held that:\n\n*\"no particular form [wa]s required for such designation and approval. Whereas it may be assumed that a writing is needed, such writing can be contained in an Investment Law as Law No. 43\".*\n\n176.\n\nIn *Klockner (supra) **,*** whereas the Contracting State had not designated the relevant agency or notified the Centre of that designation when the request was registered, the tribunal made no mention of the requirement that the designation be made directly to the Centre, but instead referred to *\"an ad hoc designation of [the agency] as a party to the proceedings.\"*\n\n177.\n\nIn *Scimitar Exploration Limited v. Bangladesh and Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation, ICSID Case No. ARB/92/2, Award (5 Apr. 1994)* (\"***Scimitar Exploration***\"), the Secretary-General registered a request for arbitration by an investor against both a Contracting State and its agency as respondents, even though the Centre had apparently never received any notice of designation of the agency by the Contracting State. Although the tribunal dismissed the case based on the claimant\u2019s lack of corporate authority to bring the proceedings, it did not address the issue of designation. According to the claimant, the case nevertheless stands as another example of the Secretary-General having determined that not receiving direct notification of designation by a Contracting State did not put the claim against the Contracting State\u2019s agency \"*manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre.*\"\n\n178.\n\nIn *Cable Television of Nevis Ltd. v The Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis, ICSID Case No. ARB/95/2, Award, (16 December 1996)* (\"***Cable Television of Nevis***\"), the Secretary-General registered a request for arbitration lodged by investor claimants against a constituent subdivision of a Contracting State where there was no indication that the Contracting State had ever designated its constituent subdivision for the purposes of jurisdiction under Article 25(1).\n\n179.\n\nFinally, the Claimant contends that in the *East Kalimantan* case (*supra*), the tribunal emphasised that the designation requirement concerned the intention of the Contracting State to designate the relevant agency or constituent subdivision for the purposes of Article 25, and not the formalities of communicating that intention to ICSID\u2019s administrative body:\n\n*\"the form and channel of communication [of designation to the Centre] do not matter, provided that the intention to designate is clearly established.\"*\n\n180.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the tribunal in that case focused on evidence of the acts of the Government of Indonesia, and whether those acts showed its intention to designate East Kalimantan as being subject to the jurisdiction of the Centre. The instruments the *East Kalimantan* tribunal examined included: (a) minutes of meetings, (b) an investment agreement, and (c) a decision of a municipal court in Indonesia.\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimant then applies the *East Kalimantan* tribunal\u2019s reasoning to the present case, and draws the conclusion that no clearer evidence of KOC\u2019s intention to designate EDC for purposes of Article 25 can be imagined than KOC\u2019s negotiation and signature of PPA Amendment No. 1, in which it consented to ICSID arbitration alongside EDC, subject only to entry into force of the Convention, and explicitly stated that it had designated EDC to the Centre for the purposes of Article 25. The Claimant submits that the *East Kalimantan* tribunal also suggested that where a Contracting State joins with its constituent subdivision or agency in consenting to ICSID arbitration in the same investment agreement, that fact alone is sufficient to find an \"*implied designation*\" by the Contracting State.\n\n**(ii) KOC designated EDC as its agency**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimant submits that KOC designated EDC as an agency for purposes of Article 25(1) in PPA Amendment No. 1. In this agreement, KOC confirmed in writing that it had designated EDC as its agency subject to the jurisdiction of the Centre.\n\n183.\n\nThe Claimant emphasises that MIME expressly undertook:\n\n*\"to procure that the Kingdom of Cambodia... notifies the Centre that it **has designated**... EDC as... [an] agency of [KOC] which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Centre for purposes of Article 25(1) of the Convention\". (PPA \u00a716.3(b)(iii)(A) as amended by Amendment No. 1 \u00a782) (emphasis added)*\n\n184.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it is clear from this undertaking that the designation had already been made. The only promised future performance was to notify the Centre. The only condition was that KOC implement the Convention, which it did in 2005.\n\n185.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s argument is based on the use of the present perfect tense of the verb \"*designate*\" in \"*has designated*\", which, according to the Claimant, indicates that KOC had already perfected the action expressed by the verb. Regardless of whether or not the designation as an agency was later communicated to the Centre by KOC, its designation of EDC as an agency in PPA Amendment No. 1 was self-effectuating and became an irrevocable element of EDC\u2019s consent. Such designation had significance in that CPC could rely on it.\n\n186.\n\nFurther, the Claimant contends that because a state will generally only approve agencies\u2019 consents under Article 25(3) if it considers them to be eligible, the designation (confirmation of eligibility) might be inferred from the provision of consent. Therefore, the approval of consent that is notified to the Centre may be interpreted as an *ad hoc* designation of the constituent subdivision or agency.\n\n**(iii) As an alternative, CPC was entitled to communicate to the Centre the designation of EDC as an agency of KOC**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimant submits that because neither Article 25(1) nor any provision of the Convention indicates the specific wording, manner, form or timing in which designation of an agency of a Contracting State must be made, the Claimant, even though the investor, was entitled to communicate the designation to the Centre by filing its Request for Arbitration.\n\n188.\n\nIn support of its alternative argument, the Claimant emphasises that the *East Kalimantan* tribunal explicitly adopted this view:\n\n*\"the designation requirement may in particular be deemed fulfilled when a document that emanates from the State is filed with the request for arbitration and shows the State\u2019s intent to name a specific entity as a constituent subdivision or agency for the purposes of Article 25(1).\"*\n\n189.\n\nApplying the analysis in the *East Kalimantan* decision to the facts of the present case, the Claimant contends that the delivery of PPA Amendment No. 1 to the Centre with the Request for Arbitration, assuming Amendment No. 1 manifests KOC\u2019s intention to designate EDC, fully satisfied any requirement that the designation be communicated to the Centre.\n\n190.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the decision of the tribunal in *East Kalimantan* demonstrates each of the propositions it advances, namely that the act of designation is separate and distinct from notifying the Centre of that act; that the Contracting State must manifest its intention to designate in writing; but that the communication of that designation to the Centre can be made by an adverse party in its Request for Arbitration.\n\n**(iv) KOC is estopped from arguing that EDC was not properly designated within Article 25(1) of the Convention**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the circumstances surrounding KOC\u2019s and EDC\u2019s unequivocal consent to ICSID jurisdiction should estop the Respondents from now contending that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction based on the argument that EDC has not been properly designated to the Centre.\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, through the PPA\u2019s arbitration clause, the Respondents unequivocally promised that EDC\u2019s designation would be notified to the Centre. On this basis, the Claimant relied on the promises of the Respondents that any potential dispute would be resolved through ICSID arbitration. Therefore, the doctrine of estoppel under international law must prevent the Respondents from asserting now that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over EDC.\n\n193.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, on the basis of the promises of Respondents regarding dispute resolution, CPC invested considerable money and time in the C-4 power plant project with the expectation that any disputes with the Respondents would have the benefit of ICSID arbitration. The Respondents made these promises deliberately and solemnly, and intended that the Claimant rely on them. The Respondents should therefore be estopped from objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over EDC due to KOC\u2019s failure to fulfil its promise to notify the Centre of its designation.\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that the present case differs from *East Kalimantan* in one important respect: in that case, the tribunal found that the claimant had not proved the necessary elements of estoppel and that, even if it had, estoppel could not overcome a failure to meet the mandatory jurisdictional requirements under the Convention. The Claimant contends that, in contrast to *East Kalimantan,* it has shown that the Respondents\u2019 promise to notify the Centre of EDC\u2019s designation, and the reliance placed upon this promise by the Claimant, satisfy the elements of estoppel.\n\n**b. Respondents\u2019 Position**\n----------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe Respondents contend that no designation of EDC has been made properly, within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention. In addition, the Respondents object to the application of the doctrine of estoppel on two grounds. First, the elements required to apply this doctrine are not met in this case. Secondly, even if they were met, estoppels cannot grant jurisdiction to an ICSID tribunal, where the requirements for such jurisdiction have not objectively been satisfied, and where jurisdiction would not otherwise exist. As long as KOC has not in fact designated EDC to the Centre, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over EDC.\n\n**(i) EDC was not designated to the Centre by KOC as required by Article 25(1) of the Convention**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the designation requirement in Article 25(1) of the Convention requires some form of communication of the designation to the Centre by the Contracting State, which was not accomplished in the present case.\n\n*(a) Article 25(1) of the Convention requires communication of the designation to the Centre*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nThe Respondents submit that Article 25(1) of the Convention is plain on its face: it requires that the entity be *\"designated **to the Centre by that State**\"* (Emphasis added). It makes no distinction between the act of designating and the notification of that act to the Centre. In other words, the act of \"designation\" has implicit in it a notification to the Centre by the state, such that absent such notification, no \"designation\" would have taken place.\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondents maintain that while some commentators accept that *\"designation by a Contracting State can take any form that gives it general notoriety and comes to the Centre\u2019s attention\"*, such as the promulgation of legislation containing an express designation, the key requirement remains that: *\"[t]here must be some communication by the host State to the Centre.\"*\n\n199.\n\nIn this respect, the Respondents cite Professor Schreuer:\n\n*\"an agreement of the Contracting State with the investor or a promise to make the designation to the Centre will not suffice. There must be **some communication by the host State to the Centre**.\" (Emphasis added*.\"(Schreuer *supra* at \u00a725-252)\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondents also cite Ms. Lamm (who cites Mr. Amerasinghe):\n\n*\"Arguably, a **clear intention** on the part of the Contracting State to file a designation may be sufficient to satisfy the designation requirement so long as **that intention is somehow brought to the Centre\u2019s attention**.\" (emphasis added)* (C Lamm, \"*Jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes*\" (1991) 6 ICSID Rev-FILJ 462, p 469)\n\n201.\n\nIn support of their argument, the Respondents further refer to the interpretation of the designation requirement by previous ICSID tribunals.\n\n202.\n\nFirst, the Respondents contend that the Claimant\u2019s reliance upon certain cases that it cites is inapposite. No one challenged the categorisation of the respondent entities as \"*constituent subdivisions or agencies*\", or their designation to the Centre by the state, in *Scimitar Exploration* or *Klockner*. However, the fact that no such challenge was brought in most cases obviously does not mean that no such challenge could have been brought. Furthermore, according to the Respondents, these cases are noteworthy because, in all of them, the entity in question had been designated to the Centre by the state, i.e. it was either on the ICSID list of designated constituent subdivisions and agencies before a request for arbitration naming it as respondent was registered, or, in the case of Socame in *Klockner*, it was designated by the respondent state to the Centre after proceedings had already begun.\n\n203.\n\nSecondly, the Respondents submit that the Tribunal should not rely on the unpublished *Manufacturers Hanover* decision to decide that it may depart from the clear wording of the Convention, which requires designation to the Centre to be made by the state. The Respondents maintain that the only other case dealing with designation, which is publicly available and can therefore be examined, explained, debated and relied upon by the Parties and the Tribunal is *Cable Television of Nevis.* However, the Respondents argue, this case defeats the Claimant\u2019s proposition.\n\n204.\n\nIn *Cable Television of Nevis (supra)*, the tribunal held that in the absence of the NIA\u2019s designation to the Centre, the tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear a claim against it. The tribunal added that it could not simply ignore the Federation\u2019s failure to designate the NIA, even though its decision effectively invalidated the arbitration clause in the underlying agreement. The Respondents emphasise that in this case, there was no doubt that the NIA was a constituent subdivision of the Federation as this was expressly provided for in the constitution of St Kitts and Nevis, nevertheless the tribunal found the lack of designation fatal.\n\n205.\n\nFinally, the Respondents presented some observations on the *East Kalimantan* case. In this case, no formal designation had been made and it was undisputed that the Province of East Kalimantan was a constituent subdivision of Indonesia. The Respondents contend that in considering whether or not a designation had been made, the *East Kalimantan* tribunal misinterpreted Professor Schreuer\u2019s words. According to the Respondents, it is clear that Professor Schreuer is not of the view that a clear intention to designate coupled with some form of communication is enough to satisfy the requirements of Article 25(1) of the Convention. In any event, the *East Kalimantan* tribunal did not decide this point, as it found that there was no intention to designate.\n\n*(b) KOC never designated EDC to the Centre and the Claimant could not do so by filing its Request*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the Convention clearly provides that there must be a designation (1) \"*to the Centre\"* and (2) \"*by that State*\". The Respondents contend that even assuming that designation under Article 25(1) of the Convention could be effected in two steps and by two different parties (which it denies), KOC has never designated EDC, whether in the PPA or otherwise, so that the Claimant had no instrument of designation to bring to the Centre\u2019s attention.\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondents submit that the wording of the PPA does not contain KOC\u2019s designation of EDC as an agency. In any event, the alleged designation was never brought to the attention of the Centre by KOC. The Respondents emphasise that even the Claimant itself admits in its Request that *\"designation could not be given at the time the parties gave their consent\",* because the ICSID arbitration clause would only enter into effect upon ratification of the Convention by KOC (which had not at that stage yet occurred).\n\n208.\n\nThe Respondents maintain that it is obvious from the plain language used in the relevant provision in PPA Amendment No 1 that the Parties intended such designation could only be made at a later date. Such designation could indeed only be made if and when KOC had implemented the Convention, which implementation did not occur until 19 January 2005, by which time the PPA had, on the Claimant\u2019s own case, already been terminated.\n\n209.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, in the absence of a clear intention on behalf of KOC to designate EDC for the purposes of the Convention in the PPA, the communication of the PPA to the Centre by the Claimant through its Request is not, even on the interpretation most favourable to the investor, sufficient to fulfill the designation requirement in Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n**(ii) Claimant\u2019s estoppel argument is not applicable to the case**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the Claimant\u2019s estoppel argument does not fulfil the three fundamental conditions necessary for this doctrine to apply. First, there must be a clear and unequivocal statement. Secondly, there must be a reliance on that statement by one party. And thirdly, there must be a detriment to the party invoking the estoppel or an advantage to the party who made the statement. The Respondents submit that none of these conditions is met in the instant case.\n\n211.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, there is no suggestion of any clear and unequivocal statement in the PPA of consent to ICSID jurisdiction. First, the Respondents emphasise that there was no ICSID jurisdiction clause in the PPA as signed in March 1996, and that it was only in 1998, with PPA Amendment No. 1, that an ICSID jurisdiction clause was introduced in the PPA. Secondly, the ICSID jurisdiction clause was subject to a number of pre-conditions, one of which was ratification of the Convention by KOC, which only happened some seven years later, in January 2005. Therefore, when entering into PPA Amendment No. 1, it was clear that ICSID jurisdiction could not be invoked at the time and that the existing ICC jurisdiction clause would govern any disputes between the Parties.\n\n212.\n\nThe Respondents contend that because the possibility of having an ICSID arbitration clause was purely hypothetical and was at this time ineffective, the Claimant could not have relied on any statement by KOC or EDC as to ICSID jurisdiction. Indeed, the Claimant was perfectly content to continue investing in the project as from 1998 with no certainty that KOC would ever ratify the Convention, and thus no certainty as to whether ICSID jurisdiction would ever be available.\n\n213.\n\nFinally, the Respondents emphasise that the Claimant was not able, and has not even attempted, to show any relevant detriment to the Claimant, or relevant advantage to KOC or EDC.\n\n214.\n\nIn any event, the Respondents rely on the *East Kalimantan* case to argue that even if there was an estoppel, such an estoppel could not operate to grant an ICSID tribunal jurisdiction where the requirements for such jurisdiction were not objectively met (i.e. where jurisdiction would not otherwise exist). The Respondents also note that the *East Kalimantan* tribunal found that the existence of an alternative dispute resolution mechanism in the underlying contract, which is the situation in the present case, was fatal to any argument that the claimant had suffered detriment in reliance on the respondents\u2019 alleged conduct.\n\n**c. Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n215.\n\nThis is a crucial issue because unless the designation provision contained in Article 25 of the Convention has been complied with, the claim against EDC must fail.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal must deal with two separate issues. The Tribunal will first decide whether EDC was properly designated as an agency of KOC within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention. If the answer is negative, the Tribunal will then consider if an estoppel argument prevents the Respondents from arguing that such designation was not properly made.\n\n**(i) EDC was not properly designated as an agency of KOC so as to comply with Article 25(1) of the Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe first issue that the Tribunal needs to consider is whether designation in conformity with Article 25(1) of the Convention requires actual communication of the designation to the Centre. The second issue is, if designation requires communication, what are the forms and channels that such communication could take? Finally, a correlative question is who can communicate the designation to the Centre for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the Convention?\n\n*(a) The need for communication*\n--------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nOn the issue of whether a designation pursuant to Article 25(1) requires some sort of communication, the Claimant relies upon observations by Aaron Broches, who chaired the Legal Committee on the Settlement of Investment Disputes which ultimately produced the phrase \"*designated to the Centre by that state\".* Broches stated:\n\n*\"The limited purpose of the requirement of designation is to avoid doubt whether an entity is a constituent subdivision or agency and thus qualified to be a party to a dispute before the Centre. Failure of a formal designation should therefore not itself defeat jurisdiction if the entity concerned is proved or conceded to be a constituent, subdivision or agency of a contracting state.\"* (A. Broches, \"*Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 1965, Explanatory Notes and Survey of its Application*\" 18 YCA 627, 642 (1993))\n\n219.\n\nHowever, more recently, Professor Schreuer has considered the issue of designation and has stated that:\n\n*\"[t]here must be some communication by the host state to the Centre.\"* (C Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed., 2009) (ICSID Commentary) \u00a725-252)\n\n220.\n\nThe issue whether Broches was correct in his view that the lack of formal designation does not defeat jurisdiction was recently considered by a strong tribunal in the *East Kalimantan* case, which stated as follows:\n\n*\"[t]he Tribunal considers that the lack of a valid designation is a bar to its jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention. While holding so, the Tribunal is mindful of Aaron Broches\u2019 view that failure of a formal designation should... not by itself defeat jurisdiction if the entity concerned is proved or conceded to be a constituent subdivision or agency of a contracting state\u2019. With Christoph Schreuer, the Tribunal considers, however, that Broches\u2019 view \u2018goes too far\u2019 and that designation cannot be dispensed with altogether. Accepting jurisdiction in the absence of designation by the state would not be in line with the ICSID Convention, which expressly constrained the possibility for constituent subdivisions to submit to ICSID arbitration within specified limits*.\"(Schreuer *supra* at \u00a7186-187)\n\n221.\n\nThe present Tribunal agrees with the *East Kalimantan* decision and Professor Schreuer\u2019s position that Mr. Broches\u2019 view \"*goes too far*\" and that \"*there must be some form of communication*\".\n\n222.\n\nIn order properly to interpret Article 25(1) of the Convention, the Tribunal must of course be guided by the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (\"**Vienna Convention**\"), as a reflection of customary international law. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention provides that:\n\n*\"[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"*\n\n223.\n\nThis is a very familiar provision, that needs little elaboration here. The starting point is obviously the text of the treaty itself, and, in the words of Sir Ian Sinclair:\n\n*\"[t]he true meaning of a text has to be arrived at by taking into account all the consequences which normally and reasonably flow from the text.\"* (Ian Sinclair, *The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 121* (2nd ed. 1984))\n\n224.\n\nThe text of Article 25(1) of the Convention is clear. It imposes the following requirements as jurisdictional thresholds for constituent subdivisions or agencies of a Contracting State: (1) \"*designation*\", (2) \"*to the Centre*\":\n\n*\"Chapter II: Jurisdiction of the Centre Article 25 (1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State,...\"*\n\n225.\n\nIf \"*designation*\" alone, without any communication, were sufficient for these purposes, the words \"*to the Centre*\" would be otiose. Indeed, as the Respondents submitted, communication is inherent in the very notion of \"*designation*\" as used in this provision.\n\n226.\n\nBeyond the text itself, the Tribunal finds further support for this proposition in the Convention\u2019s object and purpose. As elaborated in the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Convention is intended to promote foreign investment within a secure framework. Article 25 plays a critical role in delimiting the scope of the Convention regime. In this context, the designation requirement in Article 25(1) itself serves at least two specific purposes.\n\n227.\n\nFirst, the designation requirement provides both clarity and a guarantee of protection to investors (or at least some certainty in this regard) as to which entities within (and in addition to) a given Contracting State may be subject to the Convention regime. This information may, for example, be critical in an investor\u2019s choice of contractual counterparty. For such clarity and certainty to be achieved, a structured and standardised system of notification is obviously necessary, which in Article 25(1) consists of communication to the Centre.\n\n228.\n\nSecondly, the designation requirement also serves a \"*gate-keeping*\" function for Contracting States. As Schreuer states, it embodies the:\n\n*\"desire on the part of the State to preserve control over semiautonomous entities in their dealings with foreign investors\"* (C.Schreuer, \"*Commentary on the ICSID Convention*\" (1996) 11 ICSID Rev-FILJ 318, \u00a7152).\n\n229.\n\nTo this end, the designation requirement is not for the sole benefit of investors. Broches himself recognised in this specific context that:\n\n*\"while in some instances the Contracting State\u2019s* approval *may not be required, it retains the right of* designation *in all cases.\"* (A Broches, \"*Awards Rendered Pursuant to the ICSID Convention: Binding Force, Finality, Recognition, Enforcement, Execution*\" (1987) 2 ICSID Rev-FILJ 287, p.298).\n\n230.\n\nContracting States have an obvious interest in such \"*gate-keeping*\", given (for example) that any award rendered against a constituent subdivision or agency could, arguably, be binding on the State itself (e.g. per Article 54(1) of the Convention). The State might also - at least arguably - have to *\"abide by and comply with the terms of the award\"* in accordance with Article 53(1) of the Convention, even if it were not a party to the arbitral proceedings. According to Broches:\n\n*\"If a constituent subdivision or an agency of a Contracting State meets the requirements of the Convention as regards designation and approval and has consented to submit or has submitted a dispute with a national of another Contracting State to arbitration under the Convention, the former Contracting State is responsible for compliance with a resulting award, whether or not the subdivision or agency is acting for or on behalf of that Contracting State\"* (A Broches, \"*Awards Rendered Pursuant to the ICSID Convention: Binding Force, Finality, Recognition, Enforcement, Execution*\" (1987) 2 ICSID Rev-FILJ 287, p.298)\n\n231.\n\nAccording to Schreuer, this responsibility would:\n\n*\"arise from [the Contracting State\u2019s] role as designating and approving authority under Art. 25(1) and (3), from the obligation of Art.54 to recognize and enforce awards, and generally from the principle of good faith.\"* (Schreuer *supra* at \u00a753-15).\n\n232.\n\nJust as with the first object and purpose identified above, for this second purpose to be achieved, a structured and standardised system of notification is also necessary. Again, in Article 25(1) this consists of communication to the Centre. If uncommunicated approvals were sufficient, Contracting States would be vulnerable to arguments from investors that designations had occurred when this may be denied.\n\n233.\n\nThe clarity of the text of Article 25(1), in the Tribunal\u2019s view, is such that no recourse to supplementary means of interpretation (e.g. per Article 32 of the Vienna Convention) is necessary. But even if it was, the materials that have been put before the Tribunal in this case support the same conclusion.\n\n234.\n\nIn particular, reference may be made (for the sake of completeness only) to the Convention\u2019s drafting history. \"*Political subdivisions and instrumentalities*\" (as they were initially called) were added to the Preliminary Draft of the Convention during the original Regional Consultative Meetings as a recognition that states may well act through other entities (e.g. *Draft provision on extension of the jurisdiction of the Center to disputes involving political subdivisions or instrumentalities of states* (COM/AF/7), circulated during the Addis Adaba consultations (*ICSID, History of the ICSID Convention: Documents Concerning the Origin and Formulation of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (1968), Vol II, p.288*). This first draft of the Convention included a requirement that any such subdivision or instrumentality be approved by the Contracting State in question. When the Working Group discussed this extension of the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction, it was considered that this approval requirement was not itself sufficient, and it was therefore proposed that:\n\n*\"each State party to the Convention could deposit a list indicating the bodies regarded by it as \u2018political subdivisions\u2019 for the purposes of this Convention.\"* (Proposal of the representative for the UK at the Legal Committee Proceedings, 25 Nov 1964 - which was later clarified as applying to both constituent subdivisions and agencies).\n\n235.\n\nThis proposal was finally approved by the Legal Committee, which agreed that, for the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction to extend beyond the Contracting State itself, to a given constituent subdivision or agency, the entity in question had to have been designated by the Contracting State to the Centre (Legal Committee Proceedings, 9 Dec 1964).\n\n236.\n\nIt is therefore clear that the requirement of \"*designation*\" was intended to be distinct from, and additional to, mere uncommunicated \"*approval*\" by a Contracting State.\n\n*(b) The mode of communication*\n-------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nNow turning to the question whether a communication of the designation can be made through a channel other than the Centre, the Tribunal is again guided by the text of Article 25(1) of the Convention, in its context and in light of the Convention\u2019s object and purposes.\n\n238.\n\nThe clear language of Article 25(1) requires that the designation be \"*to the Centre*\". As a matter of simple language, this naturally excludes designation without communication to the Centre. If this were not so, different language would obviously have been used.\n\n239.\n\nAs noted above, the requirement of a communicated designation serves the needs of both investors and Contracting States. In each case, the system is regulated and standardised by the Centre acting as (in effect) the depository of information in this regard. The Centre is the commonly accepted channel of communication between Contracting States and investors. As a matter of convenience, and with the objective of communicating the designation to all potential investors, as well as clarifying each Contracting State\u2019s potential exposure, it is logical that Article 25(1) requires designation of an agency or subdivision to be brought to the Centre\u2019s attention.\n\n240.\n\nThis is not to say, however, that a formal notification to the Centre is the only means by which a designation might be brought to the Centre\u2019s attention. So long as the designation of an entity as an agency or subdivision of a Contracting State is given public notoriety by the Contracting State such as to come to the Centre\u2019s attention, the use of other channels of communication can attain the objective of Article 25(1) of the Convention and thus comply with its designation requirement.\n\n241.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s interpretation is shared by Professor Schreuer who wrote:\n\n*\"It has been argued that where there is a clear intention to designate, it does not matter how and through whom the communication reaches the Centre. Broches has said that failure of a formal designation should not defeat jurisdiction if the entity concerned is proved or conceded to be a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State. It seems that this goes too far. Designation cannot be dispensed with all together. But it is submitted that designation by a Contracting State can take any form that gives it general notoriety and comes to the Centre\u2019s attention. Legislation by the Contracting State that clearly includes a designation in the sense of Article 25 should suffice. This would also apply to a designation in a Bilateral Investment Treaty. Despite all this, it is advisable that the Contracting State sends a clear and separate notification of the designation to the Centre in order to avoid any misunderstandings and jurisdictional difficulties.\"* (Schreuer *supra* at \u00a725-252)\n\n242.\n\nThe key requirement, therefore, is that the designation is so communicated by the Contracting State that it comes to the Centre\u2019s attention.\n\n243.\n\nIn the *East Kalimantan* case, the tribunal appears to misquote Professor Schreuer\u2019s view. This led the tribunal to conclude mistakenly that:\n\n*\"the form and channel of communication do not matter provided that the intention to designation is clearly established.\"*\n\n244.\n\nIt is clear that in the passage cited above Professor Schreuer simply records the view of some commentators that \"*it does not matter how and through whom the communication reaches the Centre*.\" However, it is not Professor Schreuer\u2019s position that anybody through any type of channel or form can communicate the designation of an agency of a Contracting State. Quite the contrary, as the Tribunal concludes in the present case, Professor Schreuer favours a serious threshold in that the form of designation must give \"*general notoriety*\" to the designation, such as to come to the Centre\u2019s attention.\n\n245.\n\nSchreuer\u2019s position was endorsed in the *Manufacturers Hanover* case where it was held by an ICSID tribunal that \"*no particular form is required for such designation*\" besides the exchange of a writing. However, in that case, the tribunal limited the channels of communication to those by which designation would achieve public notoriety. The tribunal held that since communication took place by the publication of the designation in an investment law (Law No. 43), it achieved public notoriety and complied with Article 25(1) of the Convention in this regard. Whether or not that case was correctly decided, the fact remains that the circumstances of the present case are far removed from it. Publication by a Contracting State in national legislation is quite a different act to the insertion of a reference to a designation in a private contract. The former reflects an intention to notify the world. The latter is a private act, without any public notoriety. In circumstances where the Contracting State has taken no step to bring the private contract to the attention of the Centre, the Tribunal considers that the requirements of Article 25(1) have not been met.\n\n246.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that in order for there to be a \"*designation*\" of an agency or subdivision of a Contracting State under the Convention, there has to be a written designation which is communicated to the Centre. It may be possible for this to be done other than in a direct communication from the Contracting State to the Centre, such as in a Treaty or Legislation that would inevitably have public notoriety. But in most cases, it would be by direct communication and thus cannot be complied with by the investor itself providing a document to the Centre which contains, or is said to contain, a designation.\n\n*(c) Communication by whom?*\n----------------------------\n\n248.\n\nThere is then the question as to who is competent to communicate a designation of an agency or subdivision to the Centre.\n\n249.\n\nOnce again the language of Article 25(1) is clear. It provides that the designation to the Centre must be \"*by that State*\". This is unambiguous, and susceptible of little further elaboration.\n\n250.\n\nIf needed, the analysis above as to the functions of this provision explains why it is only the Contracting State that may communicate the designation. In particular, for Article 25(1) to serve a \"*gate-keeping*\" function, whereby each Contracting State has some form of control with regard to the scope of the Convention, it is obviously essential that communication be the sole preserve of the State itself - and not a function which investors can discharge.\n\n251.\n\nTherefore, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, communication of a designation to the Centre by anyone else than the Contracting State does not comply with Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n252.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant contends that communication of the designation of EDC as an agency or subdivision of KOC was properly completed when it filed its Request.\n\n253.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal agrees with Professor Schreuer\u2019s view that:\n\n*\"designation in an agreement with the investor is not enough. It is clear that the entity concerned cannot designate itself. But even an agreement of the contracting state with the investor or a promise to make the designation to the Centre will not suffice.\"(supra)*\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the alleged designation of EDC as an agency or subdivision of KOC by the Claimant through its Request does not comply with the requirements of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\"\n\n255.\n\nEven if the Tribunal had concluded that the communication of the designation of EDC as an agency of KOC could be effected by the Claimant through its Request, the Claimant still faces the additional problem that the wording associated with designation in the amended agreements remains, at best, ambiguous. The relevant part of the clause states:\n\n*\"If and when the Kingdom of Cambodia has implemented the Convention.*\n\n*(3) MIME agrees to procure that the Kingdom of Cambodia:*\n\n*(A) notifies the centre that it has designated each of MIME and EDC as a sub-division or agency of the Kingdom of Cambodia which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Centre for the purpose of Article 25(1) of the Convention\"*\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that until KOC implemented the Convention, there could be no question of any designation having been made. MIME\u2019s agreement upon implementation was to procure that KOC would thereafter designate EDC as its agency or subdivision. The language looks to the future and the designation of EDC was an action that KOC could only have implemented once the Convention was ratified. However KOC admittedly did nothing after ratification of the Convention.\n\n257.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant\u2019s argument that the designation was complete at the time when MIME agreed to procure designation upon implementation is not accepted. The Tribunal fails to see how it can be said that designation was completed at the time of the amendment of the agreements, namely on 9 October 1998. The linguistic arguments of the Claimant (\"*has designated*\") do not appear availing to the Tribunal in the light of all of the surrounding facts. (As the Respondents stated, the formulation \"*has designated*\" need not refer to a completed event, just as: \"*tell me when you have arrived*\"). KOC could not have designated EDC prior to January 2005. It did nothing thereafter.\n\n258.\n\nTherefore, even if the Claimant had persuaded the Tribunal that designation was properly communicated to the Centre, the Tribunal is not convinced that the wording of the arbitration provisions that were so communicated demonstrated KOC\u2019s unequivocal designation of EDC as its agency.\n\n259.\n\nIn conclusion on this point, it is clear to the Tribunal that not only does designation require a public communication by the State, but that such designation must also represent an unequivocal intention of the State to consider the entity as its agency or subdivision.\n\n**(ii) The Respondents are not estopped from arguing that EDC was not properly designated within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe Claimant has a further argument in the event that the Tribunal rules that designation as required by Article 25(1) has not taken place. The Claimant contends that the Respondents are estopped from denying that KOC has designated EDC.\n\n261.\n\nBoth Parties accepted that an estoppel could apply if the necessary elements were met. Both Parties agreed on Sir Derek Bowett\u2019s statement of the principles involved (D.W. Bowett, *Estoppel before International Tribunals and Its Relation to Acquiescence*, 33 Brit. Y.B. Int\u2019L L. 176, 183-184); namely that there has to be :\n\n(a) a clear and unequivocal statement or conduct;\n\n(b) reliance on that statement or conduct by one party; and\n\n(c) detriment to the party invoking the estoppel or an advantage to the party who made the statement.\n\n262.\n\nWith regard to the first requirement, the Claimant relies upon the PPA arbitration clause (as amended in PPA Amendment No.1). It contends that this clause contains an unequivocal promise that: (1) EDC was an agency of KOC, and that (2) EDC\u2019s designation would be notified to the Centre.\n\n263.\n\nThis alleged promise can only stem from the amendments introduced in 1998 since at the time the Parties entered into the initial transaction, i.e. 20 March 1996, the Parties were all content to rely on the original ICC arbitration clause. It is plain that when the original documents were signed, there was no promise relating to either (1) or (2) above. Further, the alleged promise contained in the 1998 version of the PPA was conditional upon ratification of the Convention by KOC which did not occur until January 2005.\n\n264.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds it hard to see how in this case an unequivocal statement or conduct can be found. A statement producing an effect only upon the occurrence of a potential future event unquestionably prevents this statement from being qualified as \"*unequivocal*\". Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant fails in establishing the first leg of its estoppel argument.\n\n265.\n\nWith regard to the reliance requirement, it appears that Claimant faces an even more difficult burden. In order to satisfy this requirement, the Claimant must have assumed that KOC would definitely ratify the Convention or that any claims it had might materialise after ratification. However, the Parties were content to rely on the ICC clause either *pro tempore* or forever if no ratification took place and thus it is difficult to see how the Claimant relied upon this alleged statement.\n\n266.\n\nWith regard to the detriment requirement, the Tribunal finds that Claimant produced no evidence of detriment. Whatever was the situation, the Claimant always had recourse to arbitration under ICC Rules in the absence of ratification of the Convention by KOC, and therefore it is hard to see what detriment could have been suffered.\n\n267.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that in relation to designation by estoppel the Claimant fails to make out a case.\n\n268.\n\nHad the Tribunal been satisfied that designation had taken place or that the Respondents were estopped from denying such, the Tribunal would have had to consider whether an estoppel ran in relation to the statement in the arbitration clause that EDC was a subdivision or agency of KOC. The Tribunal can see more merit in this point, because it was only when the defence was filed that KOC denied that EDC was an agency or subdivision of KOC. This led to a report from Professor Reisman as to what is required in international law for an organisation to be an agency or subdivision of a State. All this was very interesting indeed and the Tribunal does not think that the estoppel would necessarily have failed merely because the estoppel relating to designation itself failed. There could have been two estoppel arguments on the facts of the case. However, again as interesting as it would have been to determine, it is of no help to the Claimant, because it fails at the designation hurdle and the issue of whether EDC was or was not an agency or subdivision thus becomes unnecessary to determine.\n\n269.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal comes back inevitably to the language used in Article 25(1) of the Convention. The Tribunal acknowledges all the interesting points made by the Claimant, but cannot conclude that there has, in this case, been a sufficient designation of EDC communicated to the Centre so as to comply with Article 25(1) of the Convention. By way of summary, the Tribunal decides that:\n\n(a) designation of an entity as an agency or subdivision of a Contracting State must be communicated to the Centre by that State;\n\n(b) communication of a designation within Article 25(1) of the Convention must be in a written form and can be made through channels other than direct and formal communication to the Centre, so long as the communication by the Contracting State achieves public notoriety such as to come to the Centre\u2019s attention;\n\n(c) public notoriety of a designation cannot be achieved through the Claimant\u2019s communication to the Centre of a private investment contract annexed to the Request for Arbitration;\n\n(d) in any event, the text of the arbitration agreements in this case was not sufficiently clear as to constitute an unequivocal designation of EDC by KOC as its agency; and\n\n(e) KOC is not estopped from arguing that EDC was not properly designated.\n\n270.\n\nThis means that claims against EDC cannot proceed in this ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal notes, however, that recourse against EDC may well still be available by way of ICC arbitration, and that the Parties specifically maintained this route in case ICSID arbitration was not possible.\n\n**2. Does EDC qualify as an agency of KOC within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondents have raised the issue as to whether or not EDC is, in fact, an agency or subdivision of KOC. As the Tribunal has found that no designation pursuant to Article 25(1) of the Convention has taken place, there is now no need to decide this issue.\n\n**C. DOES THE TRIBUNAL HAVE JURISDICTION TO DECIDE CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE DOG?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimant contends that its claims against KOC under the DOG are within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and competence and fully admissible. The Claimant asserts that those claims are central to the dispute as described in the Request and are within the scope of the Parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration.\n\n273.\n\nThe Claimant submits three arguments. First, the Claimant contends that the proper articulation of the claims in the Request for Arbitration is not a jurisdictional matter, but rather a procedural issue. The Claimant adds that incomplete or imprecise claims comply with the Convention and the Institution Rules. Secondly, and in any event, the Claimant argues that it properly identified the DOG in its Request. Thirdly, and in the alternative, the Claimant maintains that it is entitled to bring claims arising out of the DOG under Article 46 of the Convention.\n\n**a. Imprecision in the Request is a procedural matter which does not prevent the Tribunal hearing claims arising out of the DOG**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nThe Claimant submits that it commenced this proceeding by lodging the Request with the Centre on 31 July 2009 in compliance with Article 36((2) & (3)) of the Convention and Rule 2(1) of the Institution Rules. Before the Secretary-General registered the Request, Claimant supplemented the Request with the submission of Supplement No. 1 on 21 August 2009.\n\n275.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that, upon registration, it was entitled to plead in detail all claims and make all arguments relating to the dispute.\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it provided ample notice in its Request of its intention to assert a claim against KOC under the DOG. According to the Claimant, such a matter is a procedural issue and its Request was sufficiently articulated to meet the requirement in Institution Rule 2(1)(e) which provides:\n\n*\"[t]he request shall:...*\n\n*(e) contain information concerning the issues in dispute indicating that there is, between the parties, a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment...\"*\n\n277.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the request for arbitration in ICSID proceedings is not meant to be a comprehensive listing of all facts, legal arguments or causes of action in a dispute. These are to be pleaded in a claimant\u2019s memorial on the merits pursuant to Arbitration Rule 31(3). Rather, as the text of Institution Rule 2(1) confirms, the claimant must merely make a showing that a legal dispute exists for the purposes of jurisdiction.\n\n278.\n\nIn support of its argument, the Claimant cites the case *ADF Group Inc. v United States of America, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1, Award (9 Jan. 2003)* (\"***ADF Group***\") *,* where the tribunal, in its analysis of the requirement under the Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, construed the requirement of Institution Rule 2(1)(e) such that imprecision or incompleteness in the setting out of issues in dispute in a request for arbitration would not adversely impact upon its jurisdiction, and observed that Article 36(2) of the Convention should be similarly construed.\n\n279.\n\nTherefore, the Claimant contends that any review by the Tribunal of its jurisdiction is now conducted *de novo*. Claimant\u2019s previous compliance or non-compliance with the Institution Rules does not bear on whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute and the claims registered. In support of this argument, Claimant cites Professor Schreuer:\n\n*\"[R]eliance on Institution Rule 2 to determine jurisdiction is inappropriate. Institution Rule 2 does not set out jurisdictional requirements in addition to Art. 25. It is merely a rule of procedure. It lists the information and documentation that must be contained in the request. Its purpose is to enable the Secretary-General to decide whether a request should be registered in accordance with Art. 36(3)... Omissions, errors and other deficiencies in the request for arbitration are not an independent basis for the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction.\"* (Emphasis added) (Schreuer *supra* at \u00a7367)\n\n280.\n\nThe Claimant also refers to the ICSID case *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. 97/3, Decision on Jurisdiction (14 November 2005)* (\"***Vivendi***\"), where the respondent objected to jurisdiction on the grounds that the claimants had failed to comply with Institution Rule 2(f) in their request for arbitration. The tribunal rejected the respondent\u2019s objection and explicitly endorsed Professor Schreuer\u2019s approach.\n\n**b. The claims under the DOG were properly identified in the Request**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it identified in its Request that the DOG as a legal obligation of KOC would be one of the subjects of the arbitration. Paragraph 2 of the Request referred to the:\n\n*\"Power Purchase Agreement and Implementation Agreement, **as** **well as numerous annexed forms** [to the PPA and IA] of other agreements to be entered into at various stages of the project.\"* (emphasis added)\n\n282.\n\nIt is undisputed that the DOG is one of the \"*other agreements*\" referred to in paragraph 2 of the Request.\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that it provided a copy of the DOG in the Supplement to the Request which contained a lengthy discussion as to why EDC\u2019s consent to ICSID arbitration in the PPA extended to the ancillary agreements referenced in the PPA and IA. The Supplement to the Request introduced the DOG as follows:\n\n*\"[t]he referenced Government Guarantee of Payments was embodied in a Deed of Guarantee entered into on 24 March 1998 (a copy of which is being electronically submitted with this letter and which is being identified as Annex 18 to the Request). In Section 1.1 of the Deed of Guarantee, KOC guarantees payment to Claimant of \"any monetary damages that may be assessed or awarded against EDC and that arise out of failure by [EDC] to perform its obligations under the Power Purchase Agreement.\"*\n\n284.\n\nTherefore, the Claimant maintains that the DOG was properly articulated in the Request and that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims arising out of this agreement.\n\n**c. Alternatively, the Claimant is entitled to bring claims under the DOG under Article 46 of the Convention**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nAlternatively, the Claimant argues that if the Tribunal were to find that the claims under the DOG were not properly articulated in the Request, the Tribunal may nevertheless admit these claims as additional claims under Article 46 of the Convention.\n\n286.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, under Article 46 of the Convention, there is no requirement that consent to ICSID arbitration be contained in the same instrument or instruments identified in the request for arbitration. It is sufficient that additional claims *\"aris[e] directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute\".* The Claimant contends that, in the instant case, claims under the DOG are inextricably related (1) to the claims against EDC under the PPA, as the latter form the basis for KOC\u2019s liability under the DOG, and (2) to the claims against KOC under the IA, as the DOG was executed and delivered pursuant to the IA.\n\n287.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant contends that Article 46 provides no procedural requirements for an additional claim, and simply directs that the Tribunal *\"shall, if requested by a party, determine\"* such a claim that otherwise satisfies the requirements. There is no formal requirement that Claimant identify its claims under the DOG as additional claims under Article 46. In any event, were the Tribunal to determine that they are indeed additional claims that meet the requirements of Article 46, it has full authority and power to admit them now.\n\n**2. Respondents\u2019 Position**\n----------------------------\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the Claimant\u2019s claims made under the DOG are outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and are inadmissible since they were not properly articulated in the Request.\n\n**a. Claimant\u2019s claims are limited to those properly articulated in the Request**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, the jurisdiction *rationae materiae* of an arbitral tribunal is defined at the outset of the proceedings. The Respondents submit that while ancillary claims can be admitted at a later stage under certain conditions to expand the Tribunal\u2019s mission, they cannot expand the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Therefore, claims arising out of or under agreements not used to define the Parties\u2019 consent are outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and must be dismissed. In support of their argument, the Respondents cite the decision of the Annulment Committee in *Helnan International Hotels A/S v Arab Republic of Egypt (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19) Decision of the ad hoc Committee, 14 June 2010* (\"***Helnan***\") where it was found that:\n\n*\"[t]he question whether an ICSID arbitral Tribunal has exceeded its powers is determined by reference to the agreement of the parties. In the case of an investment treaty claim, this agreement is constituted by the BIT and by the ICSID Convention... as well as **by the filing of the investor\u2019s claim**.\"* (emphasis added)\n\n**b. Claimant\u2019s claims under the DOG were not properly articulated in the Request and thus fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nThe Respondents contend that since the DOG was not listed in the Claimant\u2019s Request as an instrument in which the Parties consented to ICSID arbitration, the claims under the DOG are outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n291.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, Claimant\u2019s claims under the DOG appeared for the first time in the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits filed on 2 July 2010. There was no mention of the DOG in the Request, which was filed on 30 July 2009, nor was the DOG initially annexed to the Request for Arbitration. The only mention of the DOG before 2 July 2010 was in a list of attachments included in the Supplement to the Request dated 21 August 2009 as *\"Annex 18 - Deed of Guarantee.\"*\n\n292.\n\nTherefore, KOC argues, that when the Request and its Supplement were registered on 16 September 2009, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction was limited to claims arising under the PPA and the IA. Since disputes under the DOG are not within the scope of the arbitration clauses of either the IA or the PPA, it follows that CPC\u2019s claim under the DOG is outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, and should accordingly be dismissed.\n\n**c. In the alternative, Claimant\u2019s claims under the DOG are not admissible under Article 46 of the Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Respondents contend that, in any event, were the Tribunal minded to assume jurisdiction over claims under the DOG, no request for admittance of a new claim under Article 46 of the Convention has been brought by the Claimant, so that its claim is inadmissible.\n\n294.\n\nThe Respondents maintain that the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as defined by the consent instruments listed in the Request and the scope of the relevant arbitration clauses is immutable and cannot be later varied. However, a party may introduce an ancillary claim, which will expand the mission of the Tribunal but not its jurisdiction, if it conforms with Article 46 of the Convention. In support of their argument, the Respondents cite Professor Schreuer:\n\n*\"[t]he inclusion of ancillary claims under **Art. 46 does not extend the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction**. Rather, the existence of jurisdiction over an ancillary claim is a precondition for the operation of this provision.\"* (Emphasis added) (Schreuer *supra* at \u00a746-86)\n\n295.\n\nThe Respondents submit that, in the instant case, the claims under the DOG are new, as they were not advanced in the Request. As such, they can only be admitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Convention. However, the Claimant has expressly indicated that:\n\n*\"the claims set forth in this Memorial... do not include any incidental or additional claims required to be within the scope of consent of KOC and EDC under Article 46 of the Convention.\"* (Memorial on the Merits at \u00a787) *.*\n\n296.\n\nTherefore, having not sought to introduce additional claims under Article 46 of the Convention when it had the opportunity to do so, and having instead maintained that the claims under the DOG did not qualify as additional claims, the Claimant should be estopped from doing so now.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s decision**\n--------------------------\n\n297.\n\nTwo questions arise from the Respondents\u2019 objections on this issue. The first question is whether a claimant is required to articulate its precise case, including facts, legal arguments or causes of action, in its request for arbitration filed with the Centre. The second issue is whether the Claimant complied with the ICSID Rules when it filed its Request and Supplement to Request.\n\n298.\n\nWith regard to the first question, the Tribunal notes that ICSID Rule 2(1)(e) only requires the request for arbitration to:\n\n*\"contain information concerning the issues in dispute indicating that there is, between the parties, a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment.\"*\n\n299.\n\nAt no point do the Rules require the request for arbitration to articulate all legal arguments or specific causes of action that the claimant relies upon.\n\n300.\n\nIn any event, such a matter is not a jurisdictional issue. The Claimant\u2019s compliance or non compliance with the Rules is a procedural issue that the Tribunal has power to decide. As Professor Schreuer puts it:\n\n*\"[o]missions, errors and other deficiencies in the request for arbitration are not an independent basis for the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction.\"* (Schreuer *supra* at \u00a736-36)\n\n301.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Respondents are wrong in arguing that the Claimant\u2019s imprecise Request bars the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the DOG.\n\n302.\n\nWith regard to the second question whether the Claimant properly complied with the Rules when filing its Request, the Tribunal notes that even though there is little doubt that the claims under the DOG were clumsily made, two points remain in the Claimant\u2019s favour.\n\n303.\n\nFirst, \u00a72 of the Request as cited above refers to \"*numerous annexed forms of other agreements to be entered to at various stages of the project*\". The Claimant submits that it is undisputed that the DOG is one such agreement. The Tribunal is ready to accept this.\n\n304.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant actually did provide a copy of the DOG in its Supplement to the Request and included the DOG in the language cited above.\n\n305.\n\nIt seems clear to the Tribunal, and must have been so to the Respondents, that the Claimant was making a claim under the DOG. After all, this was the agreement by which the State underpinned the liability of EDC and it is doubtful in the extreme whether the project would have advanced at all had that state guarantee not been provided. KOC could not have been under any misapprehension when it agreed to guarantee EDC liabilities to the Claimant, nor would these proceedings have been instituted had the Claimant not been relying on the guarantee.\n\n306.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal is entitled to have regard to both the unity of the investment and the transaction to determine whether the three agreements were sufficiently interconnected as pointed out by the Claimant in its submission.\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the Request and Supplement sufficiently referred to the DOG to enable the Tribunal to conclude that it does have jurisdiction over such claims.\n\n**D. DOES THE TRIBUNAL HAVE JURISDICTION TO DECIDE CLAIMS BASED ON CUSTOMARY INTERNATIONAL LAW?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Claimant\u2019s Position: claims under customary international law are admissible and within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nThe Claimant presents three arguments in response to the Respondents\u2019 contentions that its claims under customary international law are inadmissible and outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. First, the Claimant submits that it properly identified its claims in its Request and Supplement to the Request. Secondly, the Claimant asserts that its claims under customary international law are within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction since even in the absence of an express reference to international law in a choice of law clause, international law is always available. Thirdly, the Claimant maintains that the scope of the Parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate as set out in the arbitration clauses of the IA and PPA is sufficiently broad to cover claims of state responsibility for EDC\u2019s repudiation of the PPA.\n\n309.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it sufficiently identified potential claims of state responsibility in its Request, which stated at paragraph 64(e):\n\n*\"\u2018Respondents\u2019 acts and omissions... otherwise amount to breaches of duty actionable by Claimant and contravene established **principles of international investment law**..., for which Claimant is entitled to and claims such remedies and relief as may be just and proper.\"* (Emphasis added)\n\n310.\n\nTherefore, the Claimant\u2019s claims under customary international law were properly indentified in the Request and are thus admissible.\n\n311.\n\nThe Claimant also denies the Respondents\u2019 argument that because the PPA, IA and DOG are governed by English law, the adjudication of claims under customary international law is beyond the scope of the Parties\u2019 consent to arbitration. The Claimant contends that in the context of ICSID arbitration, commentators have held that even when parties agree that a dispute shall be decided in accordance with a particular national law pursuant to Article 42(1) of the Convention, claims under customary international law may still be pleaded. In support of its argument, the Claimant cites Professor Schreuer:\n\n*\"[t]he mandatory rules of international law, which provide a minimum standard of protection for aliens, exist independently of any choice of law made for a specific transaction. They constitute a framework of public order within which such transactions operate. Their obligatory nature is not open to the disposition of the parties. This assertion is quite different from questions of applicable law under the conflict of laws. International law does not thereby become the law applicable to the contract. The transaction remains governed by the domestic legal system chosen by the parties. However, this choice is checked by the application of a number of mandatory international rules such as the prohibition of denial of justice, the discriminatory taking of property or the arbitrary repudiation of contractual undertakings.\"* (Schreuer *supra* at \u00a74270)\n\n312.\n\nClaimant also supports its argument by citing Broches, who noted that any agreement among the parties to exclude the applicability of international law must be express. (A. Broches, *\"Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of 1965, Explanatory Notes and Survey of its Application\" 18 YCA 669, \u00a7121 (1993))*\n\n313.\n\nTherefore, as the Parties have never indicated in the IA, PPA, DOG or otherwise an express desire to exclude claims under customary international law, Claimant contends that its state responsibility claims are properly within the Parties\u2019 scope of consent to arbitration, and thus within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n314.\n\nWith regard to the Respondents\u2019 argument that a claim for expropriation under customary international law is \"*a significant incursion on state sovereignty*\", the Claimant submits that whether or not such assertion has merit is clearly outside the scope of the issues that the Tribunal decided it would hear at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n315.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the PPA and IA arbitration clauses provide that \"*any Dispute*\" falls within the Parties\u2019 consent to arbitrate. Therefore, any event that might lead to a dispute arising out of or in connection with those agreements extends the scope of consent to \"*any remedies as may be available to it in law and equity*.\"\n\n316.\n\nFinally, and in the alternative, the Claimant argues that were the Tribunal to determine that Claimant\u2019s state responsibility claims are not within the scope of the dispute as registered, the Tribunal may nevertheless admit these claims as additional claims under Article 46 of the Convention.\n\n**2. Respondents\u2019 Position: claims under customary international law are inadmissible and outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe Respondents\u2019 contentions on the Claimant\u2019s claims made under customary international law are threefold. First, the Respondents contend that such claims are inadmissible as they were not properly articulated in the Request. Secondly, the Respondents submit that under English law those claims fall outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. Thirdly, the Respondents maintain that a plain reading of the arbitration clauses demonstrates the Parties\u2019 consent to exclude claims made under customary international law.\n\n318.\n\nThe Respondents contend that the Claimant did not properly articulate any claim under customary international law in the Request, in which it merely stated that the acts and omissions of the Respondents:\n\n*\"contravene established principles of international investment law and Cambodian law, for which Claimant is entitled to and claims such remedies and relief as may be just and proper.\"*\n\n319.\n\nThe Respondents submit that even if the vague reference in the Request to *\"principles of international investment law\"* could be construed as a reference to customary international law, it fell far short of an articulation of a claim for breach of a specific principle of customary international law.\n\n320.\n\nAccording to the Respondents, it was only when the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits or, rather, the Prayer for Relief, that a claim against Cambodia under principles of customary international law was made. However, such claim had still not been sufficiently articulated either to establish the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over it or to allow the Respondents to respond to such a claim on the merits.\n\n321.\n\nThe Respondents argue that even in its Prayer for Relief, the Claimant did not identify a primary rule of international law on which it based its claim. The Claimant merely asked the Tribunal to:\n\n*\"hold [Cambodia] liable in respect of EDC\u2019s repudiation of, defaults under and/or other breaches of the [PPA] that are attributable to [Cambodia] under the state responsibility doctrine.\"*\n\n322.\n\nThe Respondents also submit that since the Claimant does not seek leave to bring the claims under customary international law pursuant to Article 46 of the Convention, the Claimant is precluded from amending its claim now. In any event, an application under Article 46 of the Convention must fail as to bring the claims under customary international law would have the effect of extending the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, which Article 46 cannot do.\n\n323.\n\nThe Respondents also contend that even if a claim for expropriation under customary international law could be said to have been sufficiently articulated by the Claimant in its Request, such a claim would not fall within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction since the adjudication of claims alleging violations of customary international law is a significant incursion on state sovereignty; that is a fundamental principle of international law. To do so in the present case would go beyond the Parties\u2019 consent to arbitration.\n\n324.\n\nIndeed, according to the Respondents, the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is confined to the Parties\u2019 arbitration agreement. Each of the PPA, the IA and the DOG is a contract governed by English law, and an arbitration clause in a contract with a sovereign state cannot be said to confer jurisdiction to determine a claim that the state has violated principles of customary international law.\n\n325.\n\nThe Respondents maintain that it is one thing for an arbitral tribunal constituted under an arbitration agreement governed by English law to find that claims in tort are admissible in relation to a contractual dispute; however, it is quite another for that tribunal to consider itself competent to decide whether a state has complied with its international law obligations relating to expropriation. In support of their argument, Respondents cite the case *Premium Nafta Products Limited (20th Defendant) and others v Fili Shipping Company Limited (14th Claimant) and others* [2007] UKHL 40 (\"***Fiona Trust**\"*),\n\n326.\n\nFinally, the Respondents emphasise that a plain reading of the relevant dispute resolution clauses leads to the inevitable conclusion that a claim for expropriation under customary international law is outside the scope of the Parties\u2019 consent. Indeed, the PPA imposes no obligations on Cambodia, but only on EDC, whereas the Claimant nevertheless purports to bring its claims under customary international law, which, by definition, must be against Cambodia. A dispute between the Claimant and KOC as to KOC\u2019s international law obligations is not a dispute between EDC and CPC in connection with, or arising out of, the PPA, and hence such a dispute cannot be within the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n**3. Tribunal\u2019s Decision**\n--------------------------\n\n327.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no basis for the Respondents\u2019 first objection to the Claimant\u2019s claim based on customary international law. In its Request, the Claimant sufficiently articulated that:\n\n*\"Respondents\u2019 acts and omissions. contravene established principles of international investment law... for which Claimant is entitled to and claims such remedies and relief as may be just and proper\".*\n\n328.\n\nIt is true that the Claimant\u2019s phrasing did not identify specific breaches on which it planned to base its claims. However, the Claimant made clear that it was seeking to raise claims under customary international law. At the stage of the Request for Arbitration, the Claimant is not required to set out its precise case by identifying the specific rules of customary international law upon which it sought to rely. This can be for a later stage when Parties exchange pleadings or memorials on the merits.\n\n329.\n\nFurther, the Respondents cannot contend that they were taken by surprise or that they did not understand what the Claimant meant by \"*principles of international investment law*\". The body of \"*international investment law*\" includes the principles of state responsibility. For that matter, the Respondents themselves acknowledged that it was *\"probable that the Claimant [wa]s making a claim for expropriation\"*. The Claimant\u2019s reference was unequivocal. The wording used, combined with the commencement of an ICSID arbitration which is the typical forum where customary international law claims are raised, should have made it clear to the Respondents that the Claimant intended to pursue claims under customary international law.\n\n330.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant sufficiently articulated in its Request that it was seeking to frame claims under customary international law.\n\n331.\n\nWith regard to the second objection raised by the Respondents, the Tribunal is not convinced by the argument. The Respondents submit that the Parties intentionally left customary international law outside of their consent to arbitration when they decided that the agreements were governed by English law. The Respondents also try to interpret *a contrario* the plain wording of the arbitration clauses. In doing so, they state that:\n\n*\"\u2018State responsibility claims\u2019 do not relate to the parties\u2019 inability to agree upon a matter as required under the terms of the PPA\",*\n\nand that:\n\n*\"the parties are more likely to have intended the term \u2018remedies\u2019 to refer to remedies available under English law. than under customary international law.\"*\n\n332.\n\nThe Respondents are wrong in their approach to this issue. First, as it is clearly explained by Professor Schreuer, customary international law exists and may be applied independently of any choice of law (Schreuer *supra*). The Tribunal also shares Mr. Broches\u2019 view that:\n\n*\"[i]t is unreasonable to assume that the specification of an applicable national law is intended to or should have [as its] effect\" to \"exclude any recourse at all to international law\".* (Broches *supra*)\n\n333.\n\nSecondly, and additionally, the express choice of English law itself has the effect of including (rather than displacing) at least a body of customary international law, since customary international law (i.e. general practices of states followed by them from a sense of legal obligation) constitutes part of the Common law by a well established doctrine of incorporation. When customary international law changes, the Common law also incorporates these changes, save to the extent that such changes conflict with domestic law.\n\n334.\n\nCustomary international law is inevitably relevant in the context of foreign investment (and ICSID arbitration), given that it comprises a body of norms that establish minimum standards of protection in this field. It is simply unrealistic to assume that the parties to a foreign investment contract such as those in question here would have intended to exclude such inherent protection by simply choosing an applicable national law.\n\n335.\n\nEqually, parties can always consent to exclude customary international law from the scope of their dispute resolution clause. However, one would expect this to be done expressly and unequivocally. In the present case, the PPA, IA, DOG do not indicate that the Parties expressly excluded customary international law from the scope of their consent.\n\n336.\n\nThe Tribunal is also satisfied that the wording of each arbitration clause is itself wide enough to cover claims based on customary international law. The IA arbitration clause, for example, provides:\n\n*\"[i]f any dispute or difference arises out of or in connection with this Agreement. the provisions of this Section 12 shall apply.\"*\n\n337.\n\nThis broad form of arbitration clause (which appears, albeit with slightly different wording, in each of the agreements) would allow the Parties to articulate claims on the basis of any remedies available in law or equity, including customary international law (as long as these are claims that could be said to arise out of or be in connection with each agreement). The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant is entitled to bring these claims in this case under each arbitration clause.\n\n338.\n\nWhether or not any of the Claimant\u2019s claims under customary international law are actually sustainable as a matter of law or fact under each agreement is, of course, a separate matter for determination at a later stage.\n\n**IX. OPERATIVE ORDER**\n-----------------------\n\n339.\n\nAccordingly, having carefully considered all the submissions presented to the Tribunal, and having heard Counsel, the Tribunal DECIDES, ORDERS, DIRECTS and DECLARES :\n\n(1) that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consider any claims against EDC on the ground that KOC did not designate EDC as an agency or subdivision of KOC within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention;\n\n(2) that the Tribunal does have jurisdiction to hear the claims against KOC based on customary international law;\n\n(3) that the Tribunal does have jurisdiction to hear the claims against KOC under the IA, PPA (if any) and the DOG;\n\n(4) that the Tribunal makes the necessary Order for the continuation of the proceedings pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4); and\n\n(5) that the Tribunal reserves all questions concerning costs for subsequent determination."}, {"Title": "Decision on Claimant's Application Concerning Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge", "Type": "Other", "Date": "2011-04-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Claimant's Application Concerning Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nBy letters of 25 March and 5 April 2011, Claimant submitted an application and request for further relief in respect of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* over EDC. Claimant, *inter alia,* sought an order for specific performance of an alleged obligation on KOC's part to designate EDC to the Centre. Respondent objected by its letters of 31 March and 6 April 2011.\n\n2.\n\nOn 13 April 2010, the Parties attended a conference call (\"Conference Call\") with the Tribunal.\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Claimant had already requested the relief for which it now applies in its counter-memorial dated 12 November 2010 when it asked the Tribunal to:\n\n*\"order KOC to fulfill its undertaking to designate EDC to the Centre and/or to notify the Centre of its previous designation of EDC, and declare that EDC has been designated to the Centre by the Kingdom of Cambodia\" (Prayer for relief (7), p.152).*\n\n4.\n\nHowever, on 7 December 2010, at the Hong Kong jurisdictional hearing (\"Hearing\"), Claimant withdrew its request. (D2/p71/l.17-24). When it did so, Claimant sought to reserve its rights in the following terms:\n\n*\"[w]e would reserve the right to the extent we have a right. I'm not asserting the Claimant does or doesn't at the moment, to do procedurally whatever we might be able to do to address that matter... we might add that as an additional claim against the government under article 46 and rule 40(2) and seek provisional measures under article 47 and rule 39. I don't know if that relief is available. I'm just saying it's a hypothetical\" (D2/p70/l.18 to p71/l.3).*\n\n5.\n\nEven if Claimant formally reserved its rights, it is also clear from the record that Claimant was not sure whether it had any right to make such a request. Further, Claimant could not identify which provision of the ICSID Convention (\"Convention\") or ICSID Arbitration Rules (\"Rules\") might form the basis of its request.\n\n6.\n\nClaimant's reservation of its rights is enforceable so long as Claimant has a right susceptible to be reserved. This means that there must be a legal mechanism to make such application at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nIn the abovementioned letters, Claimant set out several grounds for its request. However, during the Conference Call, Claimant made it clear that it no longer based its request on Articles 47, 49(2), 50 or 51 of the Convention.\n\n8.\n\nThe only ground for Claimant's request remained Article 46 of the Convention, which provides:\n\n*\"the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any incidental or additional claims or counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"*\n\n9.\n\nClaimant contends that its claims against KOC for specific performance (1) arise directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, (2) are within the scope of consent of the parties, and (3) are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre. Claimant further submits that neither the Convention nor the Rules provide a procedural time limit within which Claimant may raise such a claim.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Claimant's request fulfills the requirements of Article 46. During the Conference Call, Respondent recognised that Claimant's request was an ancillary claim to Claimant's other claims.\n\n11.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal acknowledges that no time limit is formally expressed in the Convention with regard to new claims under Article 46. However, according to Rule 40(2):\n\n*\"An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the reply and a counter-claim no later than in the countermemorial, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.\"*\n\n12.\n\nIt is clear that Rule 40(2) leaves the opportunity to Claimant to introduce an additional claim so long as any such claim is presented before the Reply.\n\n13.\n\nAccording to the new timetable agreed by the Parties, Claimant's Reply is now due on 21 October 2011. Given the fact that Claimant has already presented its request and that its Reply has not been submitted yet, the Tribunal finds that Claimant's request is timely.\n\n14.\n\nThe only remaining issue regarding the admissibility of Claimant's request is the \"*abuse of process*\" objection raised by Respondent in its letter dated 31 March 2011. Respondent reiterated this argument during the Conference Call.\n\n15.\n\nThe question whether Claimant's withdrawal and re-introduction of its request represent an abuse of process is a procedural issue, which, pursuant to Article 44 of the Convention, the Tribunal has discretionary power to decide. Article 44 of the Convention provides:\n\n*\"[i]f any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\"*\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal proposes to consider whether Claimant's request is an abuse of process in light of the circumstances of the case, and more particularly with regard to Claimant's reasons in bringing this claim at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n17.\n\nAs the Tribunal understands it, Claimant submits two main reasons as to why Claimant is now seeking the same order in respect of which it had withdrawn its previous application.\n\n18.\n\nFirst, Claimant contends that at the time of the Hearing it felt that \"*Tribunal already had a complex set of interrelated and contingent issues to decide. and* [that the Tribunal] *preferred Claimant not press for a decision on this specific issue\" (Letter 25 March 2011, p.5).*\n\n19.\n\nThere is no basis for Claimant's assumption that the Tribunal preferred not to hear Claimant's request at the Hearing. On the contrary, the Tribunal would have been ready to hear this issue if the Claimant had requested it to do so.\n\n20.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is ready to accept Claimant's second argument by which Claimant asserts that the withdrawal of its request was due to the fact that:\n\n*\"the parties had not fully briefed the issue in their submissions and the circumstances giving rise to such a claim and the relief sought had not been established\" (id.).*\n\n21.\n\nSuch reason was clearly articulated at the Hearing when Claimant said:\n\n*\"I think in fairness to the tribunal, and in fairness to both of the parties, it's not procedurally ripe, in the sense that we haven\u2019t - neither side has researched or briefed themselves or the tribunal on that issue.\"(D2/p.70/l.3-7)*\n\n22.\n\nIt is correct that Claimant had an opportunity to articulate, as an alternative claim in its submissions on jurisdiction, a claim against Respondent for specific performance to designate EDC to the Centre. Claimant did not submit such alternative claim. However, Claimant's choice to reserve its right to present this claim at a later stage does not appear to be prejudicial to Respondent.\n\n23.\n\nAt the time of the Hearing, neither Party had briefed or supported this issue, and neither was ready to do so. Claimant's withdrawal of its request was thus appropriate. Claimant's re-submission of its request at this stage of the proceedings is permitted by Article 46 of the Convention and 40(2) of the Rules. Although the Tribunal is concerned about the way in which this matter has evolved, on balance, the Tribunal does not consider that Claimant's conduct amounts to an abuse of process.\n\n24.\n\nAn issue also arose as to the nature of the Claimant's request. Claimant introduced its request as a relief invoking Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* over EDC. Respondent contends that Claimant's request should be considered as an issue on the merits. Whether Claimant's request is a jurisdictional or a merits issue bears significant consequence, so far as the way forward in the proceedings is concerned. If it is a jurisdictional issue, there might be a basis to adjourn the proceedings on the merits until the Parties have fully addressed this issue and the Tribunal has rendered its decision. On the contrary, if Claimant's request is an issue on the merits, the Parties ought to address the matter in merits submissions without a further preliminary decision and further delay.\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Claimant is wrong in presenting its request as an issue relating to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Claimant's request for specific performance might have a (future) impact on jurisdiction, beyond the scope of this particular proceeding, but it remains a remedy, along with the claim for damages, for an alleged breach of contract. A claim for breach of contract is an issue on the merits.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that Claimant's request is a merits issue falling under Article 46 of the Convention. Therefore, it ought to be addressed as part of the merits stage of the proceedings, which need not be adjourned. In furtherance of such finding, the Tribunal requests Claimant to set out in details its case on the alleged breach of the alleged undertaking and to spell out the basis of its claim as well as all reliefs sought in a Pleading appended to its Memorial on Quantum due on 10 May 2011. Respondent shall reply in its Counter-Memorial due on 29 July 2011.\n\n27.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the inclusion of this additional claim for alleged breach of contract does not mean that EDC is now brought back into this arbitration. The Tribunal has already finally decided that it has no jurisdiction over the claim against EDC and thus EDC is not and cannot be a party to this arbitration.\n\n28.\n\nEDC could only be subject to ICSID jurisdiction if (a) the Claimant's additional claim succeeds; (b) an order for specific performance, directing the Respondent to designate EDC to the Centre is granted; (c) and such an order is complied with, and a designation effected. These are matters that will only be clear after the Tribunal has rendered its Award in this case (and the result therefore cannot impact on this particular proceeding). The jurisdictional issue regarding EDC, therefore, is entirely different to other types of jurisdictional issue (e.g. the definition of \"investment\") that might be joined to the merits of a dispute, with putative parties participating in the arbitration in the meantime.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal is conscious that the Claimant would wish the jurisdictional question regarding EDC to be resolved earlier than the other merits in this case, but given the history of this matter as set out earlier, and the Tribunal's previous decision on jurisdiction, the Tribunal sees no justification to further disrupt the procedure with a second preliminary issue and, as would necessarily follow from such a course, to lose the existing hearing dates in 2012.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal must also address a timetable issue raised by the Parties. As the proceedings have been disrupted, the Parties negotiated a new timetable submitted to the Tribunal by Respondent on 1 April 2011. The Parties agreed on all points but one. The remaining issue concerns the date of filing of a request for production of documents by Respondent relating to the merits.\n\n31.\n\nDuring the Conference Call, Respondent suggested that it file such request as soon as possible and that Claimant present its objections (if any) by 29 April 2011. The non-objected documents should then be produced by 13 May 2011. Claimant firmly objected to Respondent's proposal on the ground that Respondent's early request for production of documents would cause great practical difficulties in light of Claimant's ongoing preparation of its Memorial on Quantum due on 10 May 2011.\n\n32.\n\nOn 15 April 2011, Respondent served on Claimant a 50-page request for production of documents. In its email dated 16 April 2011, Claimant reiterated its concern that addressing such considerable request would disrupt Claimant's preparation of its Memorial on Quantum. Claimant's last proposal is to produce un-objected documents and objections (if any) concurrently on 20 May 2011.\n\n33.\n\nTimetable issues are always difficult to deal with and a perfect solution is rarely attained. The Tribunal understands Respondent's argument that the stage of requesting documents on the merits is to start as soon as possible; this was suitably done when Respondent served its request for production of documents on 15 April 2011. However, Claimant has a close deadline to finalise its Memorial on the Quantum as well as its Pleading on the alleged undertaking and alleged breach of contract. In the Tribunal's view, to require Claimant to address Respondent's request by 13 May 2011 could lead to serious practical difficulties for Claimant. This would most likely result in Claimant's non-compliance with the agreed timetable.\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that Claimant's proposal will best avoid unnecessary disruption of the proceedings without causing significant hardship to Respondent, which CounterMemorial is now due on 29 July 2011. In order to keep the integrity of the schedule, the Tribunal orders Claimant to produce un-objected documents and to present any objection(s) to Respondent's request for production of documents by 20 May 2011.\n\n35.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal finds that Claimant's request for further relief is an admissible request on the merits under Article 46 of the Convention.

Prologue**\n---------------\n\n1.\n\nThe history of Cambodia, for much of the recent past, has been unhappy and difficult. This case concerns a bold project that followed the end of a bloody civil war. The Kingdom of Cambodia (\"***KO*****C** or ***Respondent***) was short of power. Without sufficient power generation the economy could not progress and take advantage of more stable times. American interests proposed a power generation project for Phnom Penh (\"***C-4 Project***\") with support at the highest levels in Washington, [REDACTED], supported the C-4 Project. But certainly at the beginning, others in the Cambodian government did not. However, the transaction documents giving rise to this dispute were executed. Financial closing never in fact took place.\n\n2.\n\nCambodia Power Company (\"***CPC***\" or \"***Claimant***\") contends that the deal did not reach fruition due to deliberate acts of KOC (or due to acts for which KOC is responsible) designed to scupper it. KOC for its part contends that it did all that was required of it, but that the project failed because the Claimant was inexperienced and, crucially, had entered into a power purchase agreement prior to securing financing - something which it never managed to do.\n\n**II. Introduction and Parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"***ICSID***\" or \"***Centre***\") on the basis of three agreements:\n\na. a Power Purchase Agreement, entered into among the Kingdom of Cambodia, Cambodia Power Company and Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge on 20 March 1996, as subsequently amended (\"***PPA***\");\n\nb. an Implementation Agreement, entered into between the Kingdom of Cambodia and Cambodia Power Company on 20 March 1996, as subsequently amended (\"***IA***\"); and\n\nc. a Deed of Guarantee, entered into between the Kingdom of Cambodia and Cambodia Power Company on 27 March 1998 *(\"**DOG**\").*\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute resolution clause in each of the three agreements provides for arbitration between the signatory parties under the aegis of ICSID.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant is a Cambodian limited liability company incorporated and existing under the laws of the Kingdom of Cambodia. For the purpose of this matter, the Claimant\u2019s registered office is [REDACTED]\n\n6.\n\nCPC is a company wholly owned by [REDACTED], a Delaware corporation, which entered into the original contracts, the subject matter of this arbitration.\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent is the KOC, a sovereign state, represented by the Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy *(\"**MIME**\").* For the purpose of this arbitration, the Respondent\u2019s address is [REDACTED] .\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the *\"**Parties\u2019**\"*. The Parties\u2019 respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**III. ARBITRATION CLAUSES**\n----------------------------\n\n9.\n\nThis arbitration arises under three different agreements, the PPA, the IA, and the DOG.\n\n**III.1 The PPA**\n-----------------\n\n10.\n\nThe PPA contains in Section 16 the following agreement to arbitrate:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n...\n\n11.\n\nThe PPA was novated on 30 September 1996, and subsequently amended. As amended, Section 16 now reads as follows:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*16.3 Arbitration*\n\n*(a) ...*\n\n*(b) (i) If and when the Kingdom of Cambodia has implemented the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"Convention\") any dispute shall, subject to Section 16.3(b)(iv) where applicable, be referred to arbitration and finally settled in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"Centre\") established by the Convention (the \"ICSID Rules\") and the parties hereby consent to arbitration thereunder;*\n\n*(ii) The Parties agree the Company shall be deemed to be a foreign controlled company for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention so long as not less than thirty (30) percent of the shares and other securities convertible into shares issued by the Company are held by Foreign Investors;*\n\n*(iii) MIME agrees to procure that the Kingdom of Cambodia:*\n\n*(A) notifies the Centre that it has designated each of MIME and EDC as a sub-division or agency of the Kingdom of Cambodia which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Centre for the purpose of Article 25(1) of the Convention;*\n\n*(B) approves the consent by MIME to arbitration under the ICSID Rules for the purpose of Article 25(3) of the Convention; and*\n\n*(C) arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to this Section 16.3 shall be held in Washington, D.C., The Hague, Cairo or Kuala Lumpur; and*\n\n*(iv) Unless and until the Kingdom of Cambodia has implemented the Convention or if for any other reason the Dispute cannot be finally settled pursuant to the terms of the Convention, any Dispute shall be referred to and finally settled by arbitration under the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (the \"ICC Rules\") as modified herein or as otherwise agreed upon in writing by the Parties. The seat of the arbitration, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, shall be Singapore or such other nearby location as the Parties may agree provided it is in a Contracting State to the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards 1958. The language of the arbitration shall be English.*\n\n*[REDACTED]*\n\n**III.2 The IA**\n----------------\n\n12.\n\nThe LA contains in Section 12 the following agreement to arbitrate:\n\n*12.1 Disputes*\n\n*If any dispute or difference arises out of or in connection with this Agreement (including in relation to the termination thereof) (each a \"Dispute\"), the provisions of this Section 12 shall apply.*\n\n*12.2 International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes*\n\n*(a) If and when the Kingdom of Cambodia has implemented the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the Convention\") it shall, subject to Section 12.3 where applicable, be referred to arbitration and finally settled in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre\") established by the Convention (the ICSID Rules\") and the parties hereby consent to arbitration thereunder.*\n\n*(b) The parties agree that the Company shall be deemed to be a foreign controlled company for the purposes of Article 23(2)(b) of the Convention so long as not less than thirty (30) per cent of the shares and other securities convertible into shares issued by the Company are held by Foreign Investors.*\n\n*(c) MIME agrees to procure that the Kingdom of Cambodia:*\n\n*(a) notifies the Centre that it has designated MIME as a sub-division or agency of the Kingdom of Cambodia which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Centre for the purpose of Article 25(1) of the Convention; and*\n\n*(b) approves the consent by MIME to arbitration under the ICSID Rules for the purpose of Article 25(3) of the Convention.*\n\n*(c) Arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to this Section 12.2 shall be held in Singapore.*\n\n*[REDACTED]*\n\n13.\n\nThe IA was novated on 5 June 1996, and amended on 20 July 1998. As amended, Section 12.2 now reads as follows:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*12.2 International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes*\n\n*(a) If and when the Kingdom of Cambodia has implemented the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"Convention\") any Dispute shall, subject to Section 12.3 where applicable, be referred to arbitration and finally settled in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (the \"Centre\") established by the Convention (the \"ICSID Rules\") and the parties hereby consent to arbitration thereunder.*\n\n*(b) The parties agree that the Company shall be deemed to be a foreign controlled company for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention so long as not less than thirty (30) percent of the shares and other securities convertible into shares issued by the Company are held by Foreign Investors.*\n\n*(c) MIME agrees to procure that the Kingdom of Cambodia:*\n\n*(i) notifies the centre that it has designated MIME as a sub-division or agency of the Kingdom of Cambodia which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Centre for the purpose of Article 25(1) of the Convention;*\n\n*(ii) approves the consent by MIME to arbitration under the ICSID Rules for the purpose of Article 25(3) of the Convention; and*\n\n*(iii) Arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to this Section 12.2 shall be held in Washington, D.C., The Hague, Cairo or Kuala Lumpur.*\n\n*[REDACTED]*\n\n**III.3 The DOG**\n-----------------\n\nThe DOG contains in Section 7.2 the following agreement to arbitrate:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*7.2.2 International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes*\n\n*(a) If and when the Kingdom of Cambodia has implemented the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the Convention\") any Dispute shall, subject to Section 7.4 where applicable, be referred to arbitration and finally settled in accordance with the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (the Centre\") established by the Convention (the ICSID Rules\") and the parties hereby consent to arbitration thereunder.*\n\n*(b) The parties agree the Company shall be deemed to be a foreign controlled company for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention so long as not less than thirty (30) percent of the shares and other securities convertible into shares issued by the Company are held by Foreign Investors.*\n\n*(c) The Guarantor agrees to procure that the Kingdom of Cambodia:*\n\n*(i) notifies the Centre that it has designated the Ministry of Economy and Finance as a sub-division or agency of the Kingdom of Cambodia which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Centre for the purpose of Article 25(1) of the Convention;*\n\n*(ii) approves the consent by the Ministry of Economy and Finance to arbitration under the ICSID Rules for the purpose of Article 25(3) of the Convention; and*\n\n*(iii) arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to this Section 7.3 shall be held in The Hague, Cairo or Kuala Lumpur.*\n\n*[REDACTED]*\n\n**IV. procedural history on the merits**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**IV.1 Jurisdiction**\n---------------------\n\n15.\n\nOn 22 March 2011, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction upholding its jurisdiction over claims against the Kingdom of Cambodia and declining jurisdiction over claims against Electricit\u00e9 du Cambodge (\"***EDC***\"). The Decision on Jurisdiction, which is annexed to this Award as Annex 1, contains at paragraphs 15-45 the procedural history in this arbitration leading up to the Decision. This Section provides the procedural history from the date of the Decision on Jurisdiction until the date of this Award, with the exception of the procedural history relating to a witness statement filed by the Respondent, which is set out in **Section V.1** below.\n\n**IV.2 The EDC Application**\n----------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThe Decision on Jurisdiction concluded that the Respondent had not designated EDC as an agency or subdivision of the Respondent within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. This ruling prompted the Claimant to file an application, dated 25 March 2011, with a number of prayers of relief relating to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione personae* over EDC (\"***EDC Application***\"). The Claimant sought, *inter alia,* that the Tribunal invite the Respondent to fulfil its alleged undertaking to designate EDC pursuant to PPA 16.3(b)(i) and 16.3(b)(iii)(A), as amended. According to the Claimant, the Tribunal had the power to compel the Respondent to designate EDC by ordering specific performance and that, once the designation was made, the Tribunal could acquire jurisdiction *ratione personae* over EDC in this arbitration.\n\n17.\n\nBy letters of 31 March and 6 April 2011, the Respondent objected to the EDC Application. The Respondent argued that the application was inadmissible under the ICSID Convention and amounted to an abuse of process. The Claimant filed responses to the Respondent\u2019s objections by letter of 5 April 2011.\n\n18.\n\nOn 13 April 2011, the Tribunal and the Parties held a telephone conference during which the Parties set out their respective positions on the EDC Application. Following the session, on 14 April 2011, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal is satisfied that it has finally decided that it has no jurisdiction over the claim against EDC and thus EDC is not and cannot be a party to this arbitration. Thus no uncertainty arises relating to EDC.*\n\n*With regard to the Claimant\u2019s claim based on the alleged breach of the alleged undertaking, this appears to the Tribunal to be a merits issue relating to an allegation of breach of contract.*\n\n*However, it seems to be ancillary to the main claim and would thus appear to qualify under Article 46. No reply has been filed. The Tribunal notes Rule 40(2).*\n\n19.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal proposed that the issue be heard as part of the proceeding on the merits, but stated that it would deal with the Respondent\u2019s claim for abuse of process in a separate ruling.\n\n20.\n\nOn 15 April 2011, each Party commented on the Tribunal\u2019s proposal of 14 April 2011. The Respondent sought further clarifications on the nature of the Claimant\u2019s designation undertaking claim, namely whether it was one for specific performance or for damages. The Claimant reserved the right to seek whatever remedies may be available for breach of the undertaking, including specific performance as well as damages.\n\n21.\n\nOn 19 April 2011, the Tribunal issued a decision on the EDC Application (\"***EDC Decision***), which is annexed to this Award as Annex 2. The Tribunal concluded that the Claimant\u2019s claims in the EDC Application were admissible under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention as additional claims, which may be introduced by a party before the filing of the Reply, in accordance with Arbitration Rule 40(2). It further concluded that the EDC Application did not amount to an abuse of process. The Tribunal thus directed the Claimant to set out its case on the alleged breach of the alleged undertaking and to spell out the basis of its claim in a pleading appended to its Memorial on Quantum, due on 10 May 2011. The Respondent was directed to reply in its Counter-Memorial due on 29 July 2011.\n\n**IV.3 Respondent\u2019s Objections to Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Quantum**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nOn 11 May 2011, the Claimant filed its Memorial on Quantum, including four witness statements, three expert reports, exhibits and legal authorities and approximately *\"4,000 documents in support of Claimant\u2019s expenses incurred in connection with the project\".* The Claimant concurrently filed two additional claims, which are described at paragraphs 214 to 219 below.\n\n23.\n\nOn 16 May 2011, the Respondent filed observations on Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Quantum taking issue with the Claimant\u2019s presentation of additional factual evidence, the introduction of a new additional claim not admitted by the Tribunal and failure to provide key evidence in support of the quantification of its claims. The Respondent requested that the Tribunal:\n\n*(1) strike out the new submissions and materials filed by the Claimant that relate to the merits of the dispute;*\n\n*(2) order the Claimant to produce all documents upon which its experts rely;*\n\n*(3) organise, translate and re-submit the \"4000 documents\" in support of the Claimant\u2019s expenses claim;*\n\n*(4) order the Claimant to quantify its claim for damages made under its Additional Claim No. 1 forthwith; and*\n\n*(5) amend the procedural timetable.*\n\n24.\n\nBy letter of 19 May 2011, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to deny the Respondent\u2019s requests of 16 May 2011 and to admit its Additional Claim No. 2 under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n25.\n\nA telephone conference was held with the Tribunal and the Parties on 26 May 2011 to address the procedural issues raised by the Respondent.\n\n26.\n\nOn 30 May 2011, the Tribunal issued a decision on the Respondent\u2019s objections concerning the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Quantum. The Tribunal:\n\n(1) Declined to strike out parts of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial on Quantum and new documentary and witness evidence, with the exception of paragraphs 257-271 of [REDACTED] Third Witness Statement which addressed a pure liability question;\n\n(2) Granted the Respondent two additional months to file its Counter-Memorial, to be filed by 29 September 2011;\n\n(3) Confirmed that its ruling of 19 April 2011 did not limit the Claimant\u2019s relief to a request for specific performance with regard to the Claimant\u2019s additional claim on KOC\u2019s undertaking to designate EDC to ICSID, but that the Claimant could not rely on promissory estoppel, which had already been dealt with at paragraphs 267-269(e) of the Decision on Jurisdiction;\n\n(4) Fixed a calendar for the Parties to file comments on the admissibility of the Claimant\u2019s Additional Claim No. 2; and\n\n(5) Declined to strike out certain of the Claimant\u2019s exhibits which had not been organized or which had not been translated into English and invited the Parties to discuss and resolve the issues between themselves.\n\n**IV.4 The Parties\u2019 Requests for Production of Documents and Further Written Submissions on the Merits**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nOn 18 June 2011, the Parties submitted to the Tribunal an agreed amended procedural timetable.\n\n28.\n\nOn 29 September 2011, pursuant to the agreed timetable, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits, including three witness statements, three expert reports, exhibits and legal authorities. The Counter-Memorial contained a witness statement of Mr Jay Lobit which was the subject of a procedural issue which eventually led to the suspension of the proceeding on the merits (this issue is described more fully in **Section V** below).\n\n29.\n\nOn 21 October 2011, the Claimant served a request for production of documents on the Respondent.\n\n30.\n\nOn 17 February 2012, after the lifting of the suspension on the proceeding on the merits, the Respondent served its objections to the Claimant\u2019s request for production of documents.\n\n31.\n\nOn 2 March 2012, the Claimant submitted its request for production of documents to the Tribunal, including the Respondent\u2019s observations. Further observations were filed by the Respondent and the Claimant by communications of 6 March 2012 and 7 March 2012, respectively.\n\n32.\n\nThe procedural calendar was further amended by agreement of the Parties on 8 March 2012.\n\n33.\n\nOn 15 March 2012, the Tribunal issued its decision with respect to the Claimant\u2019s request for production of documents.\n\n34.\n\nOn 9 May 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal and the Respondent that it would not be able to submit the entire Reply (i.e. the submission, the witness statements, the expert reports, the exhibits and the legal authorities) on the next day, as had been agreed between the Parties, and therefore requested an extension of the time limit. In support of its request, the Claimant referred to various logistical and personal issues encountered by its legal team. The Claimant suggested that it file the completed documents on a rolling basis.\n\n35.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal extended the time limit for the filing of the Claimant\u2019s Reply to 11 May 2012. The Tribunal emphasized that last minute applications should be avoided.\n\n36.\n\nOn 11 May 2012, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would not be able to comply with the deadline, as extended. Therefore, the Claimant asked the Tribunal to reconsider its decision and allow the Claimant to file its Reply and supporting documents on 14 May 2012. The Respondent strongly objected to such request for reconsideration and urged the Tribunal to order the Respondent to submit its Reply forthwith.\n\n37.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal ordered the Claimant to file its Reply over the weekend, expressing its dissatisfaction with the situation and reserving its decision on the costs associated with the extension to a later stage.\n\n38.\n\nOn 14 May 2012, the Claimant filed its Reply, including five witness statements, five expert reports, exhibits and legal authorities. The Claimant reserved the right to file a sur-reply following the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder.\n\n39.\n\nOn 15 May 2012, the Respondent reiterated that the Claimant\u2019s delay in submitting its Reply was premeditated, greatly prejudicial and that the Respondent was opposed to any further submission by the Claimant. The Respondent also noted that the Claimant had failed to provide a final prayer for relief with its Reply and sought an order from the Tribunal directing the Claimant to file the prayer for relief within 24 hours.\n\n40.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal granted the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n41.\n\nOn 16 May 2012, the Claimant submitted its Consolidated Prayer for Relief, including 60 different categories of relief sought.\n\n42.\n\nOn 7 August 2012, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the merits, including four witness statements, three expert reports, exhibits and legal authorities.\n\n**IV.5 The Main Hearing**\n-------------------------\n\n43.\n\nOn 30 August 2012, a telephone conference was held between the President and the Parties to organize the hearing on the merits (the ***\"Main Hearing***). The Parties agreed on most organizational matters, with the exception of whether or not there should be written closing submissions by the Parties following the Main Hearing. Subsequently, on 4 September 2012, the Parties filed a tentative schedule for the Main Hearing, including the sequence of witnesses and experts to testify at the Hearing.\n\n44.\n\nThe Main Hearing was held at the ICC Hearing Centre in Paris in the period 10-13 and 17-21 September 2012. The Claimant was represented by Mr Richard Keck, Mr Rory Macmillan, Mr Jason Blechman of Macmillan Keck and Mr Toby Starr of Starr & Partners LLP, and Mr William Frain-Bell, Counsel of Hardwicke Chambers. Non-legal representatives of the Claimant present at this Hearing included [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. The Respondent was represented by Mr Peter Turner, Mr Sami Tannous and Dr Kate Parlett, all of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP. The Respondent\u2019s counsel was also assisted by Mr Fred Bennett of Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP and Ms Billie Slott of Sciaroni & Associates.\n\n**IV. 6 The Post-Hearing Phase**\n--------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Parties filed Post-Hearing Submissions on 15 November (Respondent) and 16 November 2012 (Claimant) and Schedules of Costs on 29 November 2012.\n\n46.\n\nOn 19 March 2013, the proceeding was declared closed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n**V. THE LOBIT ISSUE**\n----------------------\n\n**V. 1 Procedural History Relating to the Lobit Issue**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nOn 29 September 2011, the Respondent served its Counter-Memorial, together with supporting documents which included a Witness Statement of Mr Edgar Jay Lobit *(\"**Witness Statement**\").*\n\n48.\n\nBy a letter dated 6 October 2011, the Claimant raised concerns about the Witness Statement (the \"***Lobit Issue***\"). The Claimant alleged that Mr Lobit had in the past been part of the Claimant\u2019s legal team. As a result, according to the Claimant, the Witness Statement contained a significant amount of privileged and confidential material that could not be used in this arbitration. Similarly, the exhibits submitted together with the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial *\"include[d] numerous privileged and confidential internal communications of Claimant that appear to have been supplied by Mr Lobit\"*.1\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 6 October 2011.\n\n49.\n\nBy an email dated 11 October 2011, the Respondent\u2019s counsel brought to the attention of the Tribunal a letter by the Claimant\u2019s counsel sent to Mr Lobit. In this letter, the Claimant demanded from Mr Lobit that he take all necessary steps to (i) cease to make further disclosures of confidential information; and (ii) withdraw the Witness Statement.2\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter to Mr Lobit, dated 10 October 2011.\n\n50.\n\nBy an email dated 12 October 2011, the Tribunal requested the Respondent\u2019s reply at the earliest possible date. In addition, the Tribunal asked the Claimant to refrain from taking any further actions against Mr Lobit before the Tribunal could consider both Parties\u2019 positions.\n\n51.\n\nBy a letter dated 13 October 2011, the Claimant responded to the Tribunal expressing concerns about the Tribunal\u2019s directions that the Claimant refrain from taking actions against Mr Lobit. Indeed, the Claimant explained that if it did not take prompt action, it might jeopardize its right to claim equitable relief under US Law. The Claimant recognized that an amicable solution could still be found between the Parties with regard to this matter. It subsequently agreed to forbear from further actions until 18 October 2011.\n\n52.\n\nBy a letter dated 18 October 2011, the Respondent declined to take any of the steps the Claimant had asked it to take. The Respondent denied that (i) the Witness Statement contained information protected by attorney-client privilege; and (ii) Mr Lobit owed fiduciary duties to the Claimant, including a duty not to disclose confidential information.\n\n53.\n\nBy a letter dated 19 October 2011, in view of the Respondent\u2019s position, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it would file a formal application for exclusion of Mr Lobit\u2019s evidence from the proceedings (the *\"**Lobit Application***). The Claimant subsequently filed the Lobit Application, together with the 4th witness statement of [REDACTED], exhibits and legal authorities on 26 October 2011.\n\n54.\n\nHaving given both Parties the opportunity to state their views on the procedural calendar in regard to the Lobit Issue, on 29 October 2011 the Tribunal directed the Respondent to file a response to the Lobit Application within three weeks and the Claimant to file a reply within seven days of the Respondent\u2019s response. The Parties subsequently agreed that the Respondent would be entitled to file a rejoinder.\n\n55.\n\nA conference call between the President of the Tribunal and the Parties was scheduled to discuss the approach to be adopted by the Tribunal in considering the Lobit Application, including whether or not an independent expert should be appointed to assist in deciding on the applicable legal rules and if the specific offending material would be a breach of such rules, and if a separate hearing should be convened. Hearing dates for this purpose were preliminarily reserved, with the understanding that the Main Hearing would be postponed.\n\n56.\n\nBy a letter dated 9 November 2011, Mr Lobit, through his counsel Fred G. Bennett of the law firm of Quinn Emanuel, dismissed claims that the Witness Statement contained privileged or confidential information. Mr Lobit invoked the immunity provisions contained in Articles 21 and 22 of the ICSID Convention and numerous California law provisions in support of his position. Mr Lobit urged the Claimant (i) to drop its demand that he withdraw his Witness Statement; and (ii) to confirm that the Claimant accepted that Mr Lobit was protected by the ICSID Convention\u2019s provisions on immunity, and would therefore not file actions against him.\n\n57.\n\nOn 11 November 2011, the Parties participated in a teleconference with the President of the Tribunal, during which the Parties agreed on a number of procedural issues concerning the Lobit Application. Following the teleconference, the President of the Tribunal invited the Parties to state their views on the possibility of retaining an independent expert in regard to the Lobit Application.\n\n58.\n\nBy a letter dated 14 November 2011, the Respondent objected to the appointment of an independent expert by the Tribunal. The Claimant was in favour of the appointment of an expert and objected to the Tribunal looking at the offending material *de bene esse.* By a letter dated 16 November 2011, the Claimant further developed its position with regard to the duties of Mr Lobit.\n\n59.\n\nOn 18 November 2011, the Tribunal decided the issues that would be addressed during the hearing, which would exclude looking at the allegedly offending material itself. It was subsequently agreed that the Tribunal would issue a summary decision on the Lobit issue and that the reasons upon which that decision was based would be included in this Award.\n\n60.\n\nOn 2 December 2011, the Respondent filed its response to the Lobit Application, together with a second witness statement of Mr Lobit (the \"***Second Witness Statement***\").\n\n61.\n\nOn 13 December 2011, following an extension, the Claimant filed a reply, together with legal authorities.\n\n62.\n\nOn 20 December 2011, the Respondent filed its rejoinder, together with one annex.\n\n63.\n\nOn 25 and 26 January 2012, a hearing dealing with the Lobit Issue took place in Hong Kong at the Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre. The Claimant was represented by Mr Richard Keck and Mr Jason Blechman, both of Macmillan Keck. The Claimant\u2019s counsel was also assisted by Mr Jeffrey Vale of Valle Makoff LLP. Non-legal representatives of the Claimant present at this hearing included [REDACTED]. The Respondent was represented by Mr Peter Turner, Ms Marie Stoyanov and Mr Sami Tannous, all of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP. The Respondent\u2019s counsel was also assisted by Mr Fred Bennett of Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.\n\n64.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr Lobit gave evidence and was cross-examined. The Respondent did not wish to cross-examine [REDACTED].\n\n65.\n\nOn 29 January 2012, the Tribunal issued a Decision on the Claimant\u2019s application to exclude Mr Lobit\u2019s witness statement and derivative evidence (the *\"**Lobit Decision***\")*.* The Lobit Decision, which is attached hereto as Annex 3, declined to exclude Mr Lobit\u2019s Witness Statement and to prevent him from participating in the arbitration \"*on the sole basis of his or PDC\u2019s status or relationship with CPC and its legal representatives, including objections based on agency, confidentiality, and fiduciary duties\"*. However, the Tribunal allowed the Claimant to object to any specific communication disclosed by Mr Lobit in his Witness Statement or referred to by the Respondent, on the grounds of attorney-client privilege under Californian Law. For these purposes, the Tribunal set up a specific procedure to be followed by the Parties.\n\n66.\n\nIn addition, the Lobit Decision specified that the Claimant should not take any action in any court against Mr Lobit personally in relation to his involvement in this arbitration.\n\n67.\n\nThe factual background to the Lobit Decision, and the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning on this issue, are set out below in **Sections V.2** and **V.3**.\n\n68.\n\nOn 1 February 2012, the Claimant sought modifications of the Lobit Decision with regard to the schedule and the manner in which the objections were to be submitted, together with clarifications about the status of the proceedings.\n\n69.\n\nOn 14 February 2012, the Tribunal issued an Amended Decision on the Claimant\u2019s Application to exclude Mr Lobit\u2019s Witness Statement and derivative evidence (\"***Amended Lobit Decision***\"). The Amended Lobit Decision is attached hereto as Annex 4. Among other things, the Amended Lobit Decision restructured the timetable of the procedure to deal with the Claimant\u2019s objections to Mr Lobit\u2019s direct and derivative evidence, and revoked the Tribunal\u2019s previous order suspending the proceedings on the merits.\n\n70.\n\nOn 24 March 2012, the Claimant filed a 176 page Redfern Schedule setting out its objections to Mr Lobit\u2019s testimony and derivative evidence (\"***Lobit Objections Schedule***\"). The objections included a new ground based on mediation privilege (the *\"**Mediation Objections***\"). Specifically, it was argued that Mr Lobit had been involved in mediations between the C-4 Project\u2019s lenders and between Mosbacher Power Group (\"***MPG***\") and BHA. As such, he was said to have been provided with confidential information by the parties to these mediations but had disclosed such information to the Respondent.\n\n71.\n\nOn 3 April 2012, the Respondent objected to the new ground, arguing, among other things, that the Mediation Objections were inadmissible as they should have been raised when the Claimant first raised the objections to Mr Lobit\u2019s Witness Statement and derivative evidence.\n\n72.\n\nOn 9 April 2012, the Tribunal ruled on the Mediation Objections. It dismissed them *in limine*. According to the Tribunal, the Mediation Objections should have been raised together with the other objections to Mr Lobit\u2019s evidence in January 2012.\n\n73.\n\nOn 23 April 2012, the Respondent replied to the Claimant\u2019s objections as set out in the Lobit Objections Schedule.\n\n74.\n\nOn 21 May 2012, the Claimant added its replies to the Lobit Objections Schedule. On 28 May 2012, the Respondent submitted its last round of responses in the Lobit Objections Schedule, which by this stage had reached 238 pages.\n\n75.\n\nOn 5 June 2012, the Tribunal rendered its decision on the Lobit Objections Schedule. The Tribunal rejected the Claimant\u2019s objections to passages of Mr Lobit\u2019s Witness Statement, and to documents that were given by Mr Lobit to the Respondent\u2019s Counsel. The Tribunal ruled that for each of the objections it had formulated, the Claimant had failed to identify a specific communication that was actually protected by attorney-client privilege under California law. Additionally, the Tribunal emphasized the considerable amount of time and effort it had spent on this phase of the arbitration, which appeared to have been, in the end, a substantial and needless distraction from the real issues between the Parties.\n\n76.\n\nAt this stage, the Tribunal observes that in relation to the Lobit Application alone, it was served with over 500 pages of submissions from the Parties (excluding supporting documentation).\n\n77.\n\nThe following sections set out the factual background to the Lobit Issue and the Tribunal\u2019s reasons for the Lobit Decision and Amended Lobit Decision.\n\n**V.2 Factual Background to the Lobit Issue**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**V.3 The Tribunal\u2019s Reasons for the Amended Lobit Decision**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal found that international law governed the question of admissibility of evidence in these international arbitration proceedings. However, in determining issues of impediment, privilege and other duties allegedly owed by Mr Lobit to CPC, the Tribunal held that California law was relevant.\n\n90.\n\nSpecifically, the Tribunal did not accept the Respondent\u2019s submission that international law is the only system of law to which an international arbitral tribunal should refer when determining the admissibility of evidence in international arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal notes the Respondent\u2019s acceptance that California law governed the issues of Mr Lobit\u2019s duties towards CPC, in the event that the Tribunal decided not to apply international law alone.12\n\nRespondent\u2019s response to the Lobit Application, pages 4-5, para. 17.\n\n91.\n\nThe issue before the Tribunal was whether Mr Lobit was precluded from disclosing his entire file to the Respondent\u2019s Counsel by any duty under California law. The Claimant relied on: (i) the alleged agency relationship between PDC/Mr Lobit and the Claimant;13 and (ii) Mr Lobit\u2019s alleged personal status as a trusted adviser to the Claimant.14 The Tribunal will deal with these two grounds in turn.\n\nLobit Application, pages 19-20.\n\nLobit Application, pages 19-20.\n\n*A. The Alleged Agency Relationship Between Mr Lobit/PDC and CPC*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n92.\n\nThe Claimant argued that fiduciary duties were owed by Mr Lobit to CPC, by reason of an alleged agency relationship that once existed between Mr Lobit, his firm, and their client, CPC.\n\n93.\n\nAs a preliminary remark, the Tribunal notes that PDC\u2019s Engagement Letter does not explicitly set out that PDC and its employees would be agents of CPC. Therefore, the Tribunal must apply the Californian law test on the Parties\u2019 actual conduct during their relationship in order to determine if their relationship amounted to one of agency.\n\n94.\n\nAlthough the Parties refer to different Californian cases, it is clear that, under California law, the main criteria to be met in order for an agency relationship to arise are the following:\n\na. The Agent must have the power to alter the Principal\u2019s legal relations with third parties, and\n\nb. The Principal must have the right to control the Agent\u2019s work, and the level of such control must be relatively tight.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal also takes into account other factors mandated by Californian law, including, for example, whether the Agent is engaged in a distinct occupation or business; whether the Principal supplies the tools, instrumentalities and work premises to the Agent; and whether the parties believe that they are creating an employer-employee relationship.\n\n96.\n\nAs far as the first main feature is concerned, the Tribunal accepts Mr Lobit\u2019s evidence that PDC negotiated and drafted the financing agreements relating to the C-4 Project.15 Likewise, the Tribunal accepts that Mr Lobit assumed a lead role in PDC\u2019s team during negotiations with the sponsors and third parties.16\n\nSecond Witness Statement, page 9, para. 23; Transcript of Lobit Hearing (\"***Lobit Transcript***\")*,* Day 1, page 15, lines 7-12.\n\nSecond Witness Statement, pages 9, 10, 12, 13-14, paras. 23-25, 27, 34, 36; Lobit Transcript, Day 1, page 15, lines 7-12.\n\n97.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal is not convinced that Mr Lobit or PDC had the power to alter CPC\u2019s relationships with third parties. Indeed, the Tribunal accepts Mr Lobit\u2019s evidence that the final decision on the contracts\u2019 drafting and commercial terms was for the Claimant to take. Similarly, it is clear to the Tribunal that it was the Claimant which was to sign the agreements and contracts that PDC negotiated and drafted.17\n\nSecond Witness Statement, page 9, para. 22.\n\n98.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that neither PDC nor Mr Lobit had the power to bind the Claimant or to alter its legal relations with third parties. PDC was hired to negotiate and coordinate sponsors\u2019 efforts with respect to the C-4 Project, but does not seem to have been authorized to sign or execute contracts/agreements with third parties on behalf of CPC.\n\nOn the basis of its consideration of all the evidence, the Tribunal is of the view that the relationship between Mr Lobit/PDC and the Claimant lacks one of the main features of an agency relationship.\n\n99.\n\nAs far as the second main feature is concerned, the Tribunal concluded that PDC was an independent contractor, performing its obligations according to its own internal procedures18 while acting on the Claimant\u2019s broad instructions.19\n\nSecond Witness Statement, page 14, para. 36.\n\nSecond Witness Statement, page 13, para. 34; Lobit Transcript, Day 1, pages 20-23.\n\n100.\n\nThe level of control exercised by the Claimant was defined in the Engagement Letter as follows:\n\n*PDC\u2019s personnel shall report to, and take direction from, yourself [[REDACTED]], [REDACTED] of CPC and any other person identified by either of you.*\n\n101.\n\nOn the basis of all the evidence, it is clear to the Tribunal that the level of the Claimant\u2019s control over PDC was not high enough to match that of a Principal over an Agent. Mr Lobit or PDC were in control of the manner in which they performed their obligations under the Engagement Letter. Indeed, the Tribunal notes that the fact that PDC acted with a high level of independence was all the more understandable when one considers the relative lack of experience of the representatives of CPC in the planning, management and execution of projects similar to the C-4 Project.21 Overall, the Tribunal concluded that the relationship of agency was missing as between the Claimant and PDC.\n\nLobit Transcript, Day 1, pages 19-22.\n\n102.\n\nThe Tribunal finally wishes to make the following observations with respect to the other factors that it also took into account to determine this issue (as enumerated at paragraph 95 above):\n\na. Mr Lobit made it clear that PDC had extensive experience in *\"efforts to complete the development, finalise the contract documentation that was necessary to support the project financing, so the financing could be achieved and the project could be built\".*22 The Tribunal observes that particular emphasis was indeed put on PDC\u2019s particular skills, which in this context is another indication that PDC was not the Claimant\u2019s agent;\n\nb. The Tribunal is convinced that the Parties understood that PDC was to perform its obligations as an independent services provider, and not an employee of the Claimant. This is established by the wording of the Engagement Letter, and Mr Lobit\u2019s evidence.23\n\nLobit Transcript, Day 1, page 23.\n\nR209. The Engagement Letter reads: [REDACTED] See also for example Lobit Transcript, Day 1, pages 20-23.\n\n103.\n\nThe Claimant based Mr Lobit\u2019s alleged duty of confidentiality on an alleged agency relationship as between him and the Claimant. Since the Claimant failed to establish that Mr Lobit or PDC can be considered as Agents of the Claimant under California law, it logically follows that neither can be bound by California law agency-related duties and obligations, and in particular, by the duty of confidentiality alleged by the Claimant.\n\n*B. Mr Lobit\u2019s Status as Trusted Adviser\" to the Claimant*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nIn the alternative, the Claimant argued that due to his status as a \"trusted adviser\" to the Claimant, Mr Lobit owed a duty of loyalty to the Claimant, and was thereby under an obligation not to disclose private or confidential communications of the Claimant, and not to testify against his former employer.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal was puzzled by the way in which this argument was developed by the Claimant. It seemed to the Tribunal that the Claimant failed clearly to define a *\"trusted adviser\"* and its legal status under California law (merely repeating that Mr Lobit was the Claimant\u2019s fiduciary).24 Similarly, it appeared to the Tribunal that the Claimant was unable clearly to distinguish the precise source of the alleged duties of confidentiality under this alternative thesis, and to distinguish this from general fiduciary duties that might arise from an agency relationship. Indeed, the Claimant referred to Mr Lobit\u2019s status as \"agent\" and his \"advisor\u2019s\" status as two interchangeable sources of the alleged duties.\n\nClaimant\u2019s reply on the Lobit Issue, Section 4.3.3.\n\n106.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that, in fact, the Claimant\u2019s inability to state a clear basis for both duties stems from the fact that the \"*trusted adviser*\" concept is not a legal concept capable of being clearly defined in law. This is the reason why the Claimant repeatedly referred back to the agency concept to support its submissions regarding both duties.\n\n107.\n\nIn order to illustrate this finding, the Tribunal refers to the Claimant\u2019s reply on the Lobit Issue, in which the Claimant stated, at Section 4.3.4:\n\n*Another legal impediment requiring the exclusion of Lobit\u2019s witness statement and testimony is his duty of loyalty to [the] Claimant. As noted in the [Lobit] Application, an agent or other fiduciary owes \"a fiduciary duty to act loyally for the principal\u2019s benefit in all matters connected with the agency relationship* (emphasis added).25\n\nClaimant\u2019s reply on the Lobit Issue, Section 4.3.4. By reading this excerpt, one can see that the Claimant fails to identify a clear alternative basis to the agency theory to support Mr Lobit\u2019s alleged duties towards CPC.\n\n108.\n\nOverall, having carefully considered each of the Claimant\u2019s submissions, the Tribunal concluded that the Claimant had failed to establish any alternative basis for the duties it sought to impose. Since the Engagement Letter did not expressly provide for a fiduciary status for PDC, and nor did any other document upon which the parties\u2019 relationship proceeded, the burden was on the Claimant to show that PDC was in fact the Claimant\u2019s fiduciary. It failed to do so.\n\n109.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal found that Mr Lobit was neither bound by a duty of confidentiality nor by a duty of loyalty towards the Claimant, under California law.\n\n110.\n\nAs a result, in relation to the Lobit Objections Schedule, the Tribunal gave the Claimant the opportunity to challenge the admissibility of Mr Lobit\u2019s testimony and derivative evidence only on the ground of California law attorney-client privilege.\n\n**VI. THE [REDACTED] AND BIT ISSUE**\n------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nOn 13 February 2012, the Claimant filed two further applications relating to the involvement of [REDACTED] (CPC\u2019s former legal counsel) in the dispute, and the position of [REDACTED], a Cambodian lawyer who had submitted a legal opinion in these proceedings. The Claimant sought orders to prevent the Respondent from discussing the proceedings with [REDACTED], on the basis that he was alleged to have aided the Respondent\u2019s legal team. The Claimant also requested the Tribunal to order that no action be taken against [REDACTED], who was alleged to have suffered from retaliatory actions carried out by the Respondent due to his cooperation with the Claimant.\n\n112.\n\nOn 21 February 2012, the Respondent filed a response to the [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] applications, denying the allegations. In the end, these applications were not pursued.\n\n**VII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND TO THE MERITS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nIn 1994, KOC announced a tender process to select an independent power producer to invest in, construct, own and operate a 60MW electric power plant in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, known as the C-4 power plant project, and to sell that plant\u2019s capacity and electricity to EDC for a 20 to 25-year term.\n\n114.\n\nIn July 1995, BHA, a Delaware corporation, was invited by the [REDACTED] of Cambodia to participate in a competitive bidding process, and submitted an application in response to EDC\u2019s request for proposals.\n\n115.\n\nAt this time, EDC was a department within MIME, and was therefore part of the Government of KOC.\n\n116.\n\nIn late 1995, BHA was selected as winner of the tender. BHA, KOC and EDC then negotiated the legal documentation for the investment by BHA into the Cambodian state power industry, which later resulted in two main agreements, the PPA and the IA, as well as numerous annexed forms of other agreements to be entered into at various stages of the project.\n\n117.\n\nOn 9 March 1996, a Royal Decree declared the establishment of a new EDC. KOC transformed EDC into a state-owned limited liability enterprise duly organized and validly existing under the laws of KOC. Following this change, the rights and obligations which were those of the old EDC were diluted between the new EDC and a newly created state agency: the Electricity Authority of Cambodia (\"***EAC***\"). The new EDC remained fully owned by KOC which was also empowered to appoint its board of directors.\n\n118.\n\nThe PPA and IA were signed on 20 March 1996. The PPA was signed by BHA, KOC and EDC. However, EDC was not a party to the IA which was entered into only by BHA and KOC. As set out in **Section III.1** above, the PPA contained an arbitration clause providing for an arbitration administered by the International Chamber of Commerce (\"***ICC***\") in case of a dispute. By contrast, the IA contained an arbitration clause providing for ICSID arbitration, or, as a default forum, for ICC arbitration if ICSID arbitration was not available.\n\n119.\n\nBHA subsequently formed the Claimant (CPC) as a limited liability project company under Cambodian law, and on 5 June and 30 September 1996, KOC, EDC, BHA and CPC entered into two Novation Agreements (\"***Novation Agreements***) substituting CPC for BHA in the IA and PPA respectively.\n\n120.\n\nOn 9 October 1998. KOC, EDC and CPC amended the PPA (\"***PPA Amendment No. I***\").This included an amendment to the dispute resolution clause of the PPA, to provide for ICSID arbitration or, consonant with the provision contained in the IA, for ICC arbitration if ICSID arbitration was not available. This ICSID arbitration clause was drafted in similar terms to the ICSID arbitration clause contained in the IA, albeit with some differences (the importance of which is contested). Under this amendment, the new EDC joined the PPA as a party replacing the old EDC.\n\n121.\n\nMIME, as a ministry of KOC, executed PPA Amendment No.1 for and on behalf of KOC. According to PPA Article 16.3(b)(iii)(A) as amended by PPA Amendment No. 1:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n122.\n\nIn fact, KOC never notified the Centre of the designation, if any, of EDC as its agency for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the Convention.\n\n123.\n\nOn 27 March 1998, the DOG was signed between KOC (Ministry of Economy and Finance) and CPC. As set out in **Section III.3** above, the DOG contains an arbitration clause similar to the one contained in the IA.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimant contends that from 1998 to 2004, KOC and EDC repeatedly and deliberately breached their contractual obligations. As a result, CPC was not able to build the power plant, and finally decided to accept KOC\u2019s and EDC\u2019s repudiation of the project contracts. Such alleged repudiation is said to have caused CPC to lose its entire investment and the benefit of its bargain.\n\n125.\n\nOn 20 December 2004, KOC ratified the ICSID Convention which entered into force in Cambodia on 19 January 2005.\n\n126.\n\nOn 30 July 2009, the Claimant commenced this arbitration by submitting its Request to the Centre.\n\n**VIII. THE DISPUTE IN BRIEF**\n------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, following the signature of the PPA and IA, CPC took all preliminary steps to design and obtain all permits for the building and operation of the C-4 power plant, and was prepared to proceed. It contends that it had also arranged the requisite debt and equity financing, including obtaining the approval of the board of directors of the World Bank to proceed with financing the project as anchor lender.\n\n128.\n\nHowever, according to the Claimant, from 1998 to 2004, the Respondent persistently breached its obligations to support the project, and repeatedly took actions that were inconsistent with those obligations. As a consequence of the Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions, so the Claimant argues, the power plant anticipated under the investment contracts was never built. The Claimant submits that KOC and EDC reneged on their commitments in the investment agreements; failed and refused to permit the Claimant to develop and profit from the C-4 power plant project; and denied the Claimant the fruits of its investment.\n\n129.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, KOC\u2019s and EDC\u2019s alleged obligations could never have arisen, because there was never a realistic chance that the C-4 Project could be financed. It argues that the Claimant failed to show any breach of the PPA or the IA by the KOC or EDC. On the Respondent\u2019s case, the Claimant made misconceived excuses and fraudulent misrepresentations in order to obtain extensions of time under the agreements. In addition, according to the Respondent, the claim under the DOG is outside of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and/or is inadmissible.\n\n130.\n\nAs noted earlier, whilst this ICSID arbitration was commenced against both KOC and EDC, by its Decision on Jurisdiction dated 22 March 2011, the Tribunal declined jurisdiction over the Claimant\u2019s claims against EDC.\n\n**IX. THE PARTIES\u2019 PRAYERS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**IX.1 The Claimant\u2019s Requests**\n--------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s latest prayer for relief, as submitted on 16 May 2012, is as follows:\n\n*I. In respect of CPC\u2019s claims against KOC for KOC\u2019s and EDC\u2019s repudiation of, default under and/or breach of the IA and PPA*\n\n*This portion of CPC\u2019s consolidated prayer for relief combines its prayers for relief as previously set forth in its Memorial on the Merits (Part 2) of 10 May 2011 and Additional Claim No. 2: Liability of KOC for Cross-Defaults under IA Caused by EDC\u2019s Material Breach of PPA, and as modified and supplemented in its Reply on the Merits of 13 May 2012.*\n\n*CPC seeks a monetary award against KOC based on the following findings of fact, conclusions of law, declarations, decisions and orders (including any subordinate, subsumed or additional findings of fact, conclusions of law, declarations or orders), which CPC prays that the

responsibility doctrine, declare that EDC repudiated, defaulted under and/or otherwise breached the PPA on or before 27 July 2001, bringing it to an end on or after 5 June 2004, when CPC accepted EDC\u2019s repudiation, or such other dates as the Tribunal may find based on the evidence and the law, and rendering EDC liable to pay CPC any and all damages caused by EDC at common law;*\n\n*(2) For purposes of determining KOC\u2019s liability to CPC (a) under the DOG, (b) under the IA cross-default provisions and/or (c) under the state responsibility doctrine, declare that EDC is liable under the PPA to indemnify CPC for its damages, losses and reasonable costs and expenses (including, but not limited to, legal fees and expert witness fees) in connection with, arising out of or

Tribunal, admissible in this proceeding and fully within the scope of KOC\u2019s obligations under the DOG, including by declaring that (a) a legal dispute has arisen under the DOG, (b) CPC has fulfilled any conditions precedent for making its claims under the DOG, (c) CPC's claims are for amounts due and owing by EDC to CPC, and (d) CPC's claims are recoverable under the DOG without CPC first having to bring proceedings or obtain an award against EDC;*\n\n*(4) Declare that KOC is liable under the DOG to pay CPC all amounts owed by EDC to CPC under or pursuant to the PPA as a consequence of EDC's repudiation, default under and/or other breach of the PPA and/or pursuant to the PPA indemnity provisions;*\n\n*(5) Declare that KOC is liable to CPC for damages for breach of its duty to effect a cure of the cross-default under IA section 10.3 arising from EDC's material breach of the PPA, including declaring that CPC fulfilled any conditions precedent for bringing its claim;*\n\n*(6) Declare that KOC is liable to indemnify CPC under IA section 11.2 based on the uncured cross-default under IA section 10.2(a) arising from EDC's material breach of the PPA, including declaring that CPC fulfilled any conditions precedent for bringing its claim;*\n\n*(7) Declare that KOC is liable under the doctrine of state responsibility to pay CPC all liabilities of EDC to CPC

pre-award and post-award interest on all damages assessed and awarded against KOC;*\n\n*(13) In determining causation, declare that CPC had a real or substantial chance of successfully (a) completing its project financing for the C4 power plant, (b) completing construction of the C4 power plant and (c) operating the C4 power plant in accordance with the terms and conditions of the PPA throughout the term provided therein, and that any question of certainty of loss, if damages are calculated under the normal measure, will be accounted for in assessing quantum;*\n\n*(14) Declare that EDC\u2019s repudiation of, default under and/or breach of the PPA and/or KOC\u2019s repudiation, default under and/or breach of the IA has caused CPC to incur damages in the form of CPC\u2019s loss of chance to receive the entire benefit of its bargain under the IA and PPA and that, prior to any discount for certainty of loss, those damages should be assessed in accordance with CPC\u2019s loss of expectation, the normal measure;*\n\n*(15) Declare that CPC had a 95% chance of successfully completing its project financing for the C4 power plant, or such other percentage chance as the Tribunal assesses based on the evidence and the law (the \"Financing Probability\" or \"FP\");*\n\n*(16) Declare that CPC had a 99% chance of successfully completing construction of the C4 power plant, or such other percentage chance as the Tribunal assesses based on the evidence and the law (the \"Construction Probability\" or \"CP\");*\n\n*(17) Declare that CPC had a 97% chance of operating the C4 power plant in each of the 25 years of commercial operations during the term of the PPA, or such other percentage chance as the Tribunal assesses based on the evidence and the law (the \"Operations

losses should be assessed at the scheduled dates for performance, (c) losses occurring at scheduled dates of performance after the date of the award should be discounted back to the date of the award, (d) losses occurring at scheduled dates of performance before the date of the award should be increased to the date of the award by pre-award interest, (e) the discount rate should be a reasonable and appropriate rate consistent with the 10% rate stipulated by CPC, EDC and KOC in the PPA, and (f) the discount rate should not include any discount for the risk of default or breach by KOC or EDC;*\n\n*(19) Declare that, as of the final hearing date, CPC\u2019s loss-of-expectation damages, i.e. the normal measure, caused by or resulting from EDC\u2019s repudiation of, default under and/or breach of the PPA and/or KOC\u2019s repudiation of, default under and/or breach of the IA, taking account of the Operations Probability but prior to any adjustment for Financing Probability or Construction Probability, is the amount calculated by CPC\u2019s experts, LBC International, in their third report or such other amount as the Tribunal assesses based on the evidence and the law (the \"Gross Expectancy\" or \"GE\");*\n\n*(20) Declare that the quantum of damages suffered by CPC through the loss of chance of receiving its benefit of the bargain (the \"Net Expectancy\" or \"NE\") is equal to the amount calculated using the following formula:*\n\n*NE = GE x FP x CP where:*\n\n*NE means Net Expectancy, GE means Gross Expectancy, FP means Financing Probability, and CP means Construction Probability;*\n\n*(21) Calculate and assess the quantum of CPC\u2019s Net Expectancy damages by applying the formula set out in (20);*\n\n*(22) Declare that, in addition to its Net Expectancy damages, CPC is entitled, under the normal measure, to damages for its losses and expenses incurred or suffered in mitigation, including moneys spent in mitigation, sweat equity spent in mitigation and loss of use of investment capital suffered in mitigation (or, in lieu thereof, pre-award interest during periods of delay), including by declaring that such heads of damages are within the normal measure under the first leg of Hadley v Baxendale;*\n\n*(23) Declare that the quantum of CPC\u2019s mitigation damages are the amounts set out in the third expert report of LBC International or such other amount as the Tribunal assesses based on the evidence and the law;*\n\n*(24) In the alternative to (14-23), but only if the Tribunal properly finds based on the evidence and the law that the normal measure of damages under English contract law is unavailable, declare that the amount of wasted costs damages suffered by CPC as a result of EDC's repudiation of, default under and/or breach of the PPA is the amount set out in the fourth expert report of LBC International, or such other amount as the Tribunal assesses based on the evidence and the law;*\n\n*(25) Award CPC, and order KOC to pay, CPC's damages caused by EDC for which KOC is liable;*\n\n*(26) Award CPC, and order KOC to pay, CPC's damages caused by KOC;*\n\n*(27) Award CPC, and order KOC to pay, the costs of this arbitration proceeding and CPC's own party costs;*\n\n*(28) Award CPC, and order KOC to pay, pre-award and post-award interest on all damages assessed from the date assessed to the date paid at the Default Rate specified in the PPA or such other rate as the Tribunal assesses based on the evidence and the law;*\n\n*(29) Declare that CPC's claims under the IA are not time-barred based on the six-year limitation period applicable to the IA;*\n\n*(30) Declare that CPC's claims under the DOG are not time- barred based either on the twelve-year limitation period applicable to the DOG or on the six-year limitation period applicable to the PPA;*\n\n*(31) Declare that CPC had no duty to apply to the EAC for an electricity license from and after the date the EAC began accepting applications, in mitigation of damages or otherwise, because KOC and EDC had previously repudiated the IA and PPA, and such repudiation, which was continuing from on or before 27 July 2001 through on or after 5 June 2004, when CPC terminated the IA and PPA, created impossibility of performance by CPC in obtaining project financing for the C4 power plant; and*\n\n*(32) Make such further decisions, rulings and findings and order and award such further relief as may be necessary, just or proper in connection with this proceeding.*\n\n*II. In respect of CPC's claim against KOC for failure to designate EDC to the Centre*\n\n*This section sets forth CPC's prayer for relief on its Additional Claim No. 1: Designation of EDC.*\n\n*CPC seeks a monetary award and/or an order of specific performance and other equitable relief against KOC based on the following findings of fact, conclusions of law, declarations, decisions and orders (including any subordinate, subsumed or additional findings of fact, conclusions of law, declarations or orders), which CPC prays that the Tribunal include in its final award:*\n\n*(33) Declare that EDC objectively qualifies as an agency of KOC within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the Convention;*\n\n*(34) Declare that KOC had an implied obligation under the PPA to designate EDC as its agency under Article 25(1) of the Convention if and when it had implemented the Convention;*\n\n*(35) Declare that KOC had an express obligation under the PPA to notify the Centre that it had designated EDC as its agency under Article 25(1) of the Convention if and when it had implemented the Convention;*\n\n*(36) Declare that KOC has breached its express and implied obligations to designate EDC as its agency and to notify the Centre that it had so designated EDC;*\n\n*(37) Order KOC to fulfill its undertakings to designate EDC to the Centre and to notify the Centre that it has so designated EDC;*\n\n*(38) Declare that KOC is liable to Claimant for its damages (in an amount to be proved at a later stage in this proceeding) caused by KOC\u2019s failure to fulfill its undertakings to designate EDC to the Centre and to notify the Centre that it has so designated EDC;*\n\n*(39) Award Claimant, and order KOC to pay, Claimant\u2019s damages caused by KOC\u2019s breach of its express and implied obligations to designate EDC as its agency and to notify the Centre that it has so designated EDC;*\n\n*(40) Declare that KOC is barred by promissory estoppel from raising any procedural or substantive defenses that rest on EDC\u2019s absence from this proceeding as a party.*\n\n*(41) Reject any procedural or substantive defenses raised by KOC in this proceeding that rest on EDC\u2019s absence from this proceeding as a party, including, without limitation, any defenses to CPC\u2019s right to claim or recover against KOC under the DOG;*\n\n*(42) Order KOC to pay all costs incurred by Claimant in connection with the preliminary objections regarding jurisdiction over EDC and this additional claim, which amounts will be shown when costs are assessed in this proceeding; and*\n\n*(43) Make such further decisions, rulings and findings and order and award such further relief as may be necessary, just or proper in connection with this additional claim, including, without limitation, declaring that the limitation period in respect of CPC\u2019s claims against EDC under the PPA and against KOC under the DOG ceased to run (or was tolled or suspended) from the date this proceeding was registered by the Secretary General of ICSID until a reasonable time (at least six months) after KOC notifies CPC that it has designated EDC to the Centre*\n\n*III. In respect of KOC\u2019s counterclaims for rescission and damages based on fraudulent misrepresentation*\n\n*CPC seeks dismissal of KOC\u2019s counterclaims and an award of costs against KOC based on the following findings of fact, conclusions of law, declarations, decisions and orders (including any subordinate, subsumed or additional findings of fact, conclusions of law, declarations or orders), which CPC prays that the Tribunal include in its final award:*\n\n*A. As to both counterclaims*\n\n*(44) Declare that CPC did not make any fraudulent misrepresentations to KOC;*\n\n*(45) Declare that, in any event, all PPA extensions were approved by KOC after CPC\u2019s disclosure to KOC of all relevant and material circumstances regarding the bribery allegations and related suspension of work by the IFC;*\n\n*(46) Declare that CPC had no duty to disclose the bribery allegations and IFC suspension of work to EDC insofar as KOC is concerned;*\n\n*(47) Declare that EDC\u2019s PPA defenses do not relieve KOC from DOG liability;*\n\n*(48) Make such further decisions, rulings and findings and order and award such further relief as may be necessary, just or proper in connection with KOC\u2019s counterclaims;*\n\n*B. As to KOC\u2019s counterclaim for rescission*\n\n*(49) Declare that KOC and EDC had unclean hands and this bars KOC from obtaining equitable relief;*\n\n*(50) Declare that KOC is not entitled to rescind the PPA on EDC's behalf;*\n\n*(51) Declare that KOC's rescission claim is barred by laches;*\n\n*(52) Dismiss KOC's counterclaim for rescission;*\n\n*(53) Award CPC its costs in defending KOC's counterclaim for rescission;*\n\n*C. As to KOC's counterclaim for damages*\n\n*(54) Declare that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over KOC's damages counterclaim because it is an action sounding in tort and the Parties did not consent to arbitrate tort claims;*\n\n*(55) Declare that KOC has failed to state a claim on which relief can be granted with respect to its counterclaim for damages because KOC has not shown that CPC is subject to English tort law;*\n\n*(56) Declare that KOC's counterclaim for damages is time-barred;*\n\n*(57) Declare that KOC has not shown that the alleged tort caused any loss; and*\n\n*(58) Declare that KOC has not shown any quantum of loss resulting from the alleged tort;*\n\n*(59) Dismiss KOC's counterclaim for rescission; and*\n\n*(60) Award CPC its costs in defending KOC's counterclaim for damages.*\n\n**IX.2 The Respondent's Requests**\n----------------------------------\n\n132.\n\nIn its Rejoinder on the Merits dated 7 August 2012, the Respondent formulated its prayer for relief as follows:\n\n*497. On the basis of the foregoing, the Respondent respectfully requests that the Arbitral Tribunal:*\n\n*(1) Declare that the Respondent's election to rescind Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 to the PPA is effective and as a consequence the PPA and the IA should be considered to be validly terminated;*\n\n*(a) as a consequence, dismiss all of the Claimant\u2019s claims in this proceeding;*\n\n*(b) in the alternative, order the Claimant to pay the Respondent damages in the amount of any award made against KOC, plus costs incurred in defending against the Claimant\u2019s claims;*\n\n*(2) In the further alternative:*\n\n*(a) **declare** that the Claimant\u2019s claim under the DOG is outside the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and/or inadmissible;*\n\n*(b) **dismiss** all of the Claimant\u2019s claims in this proceeding, and*\n\n*(3) In any event, **order** the Claimant to pay all of the costs and expenses incurred by the Respondent and by EDC in defending against the Claimant\u2019s claims, including, but not limited to, the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses, the fees and expenses of the Respondent\u2019s and EDC\u2019s counsel and experts, and interest, on a full indemnity basis.*\n\n**X.

THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n**XII.1 Overview**\n------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe Parties have argued their respective cases extensively and in great detail. The submissions are replete with complex factual scenarios and interesting legal questions. Before even considering the legal questions, it is essential for the Tribunal to decide what actually happened. The Tribunal has, of course, considered all the material both written and oral and makes no apology for not repeating it all in this award. Instead, it will concentrate on those parts of the facts and submissions which it considers most relevant to its determinations.\n\n263.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s case is that there were breaches of the PPA and the IA for which the Respondent is responsible. These breaches include the acts and omissions of EDC. Although EDC is no longer a party to these proceedings, and although it is not a party to the IA, its conduct remains relevant, particularly due to the cross default provisions in the IA.\n\n264.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the actions of the Respondent/EDC caused the C-4 Project to fail. The Tribunal accepts that [REDACTED] firmly believes that those who had originally opposed the project within KOC eventually got their way. If he is correct that the Respondent/EDC committed breaches of the agreements, then the Tribunal needs to go on to decide a number of issues such as the valuation of a chance, causation and damage, as well as having to consider the counterclaim.\n\n265.\n\nThe Respondent on the other hand maintains that neither it nor EDC did anything to kill the project. The project, it submits, among other things, died because the Claimant could not get its finance together, in circumstances where it had made a legal commitment to finance the project prior to proceeding to more advanced stages, such as construction.\n\n266.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the lack of expertise of [REDACTED] and his team in what was a complex endeavour, exacerbated by the unusual circumstances surrounding a transaction involving KOC which had only recently emerged from a bloody and brutal civil war.\n\n267.\n\nAlthough the facts have been set out at some length above, the Tribunal will need to go into more detail in the context of the contractual timeline which the Parties helpfully addressed on the last day of the hearing.\n\n268.\n\nMr Keck, who argued this case most tenaciously and strenuously on behalf of the Claimant, submitted that the case was about *\"buyer's remorse\"* and *\"death by a thousand cuts\"*. Giving full credit to this advocatorial hyperbole, the Tribunal will bear this firmly in mind as it reviews the detailed facts.\n\n**XII.2 The Agreements**\n------------------------\n\n269.\n\nThe starting point must of course be the Agreements, the relevant details of which are set out below.\n\n270.\n\nThe IA and PPA were signed by BHA. BHA's rights and obligations under these agreements were novated to the Claimant on 30 September 1996.\n\n*A. The PPA*\n------------\n\n271.\n\nAs stated in its recitals, the PPA was intended to further KOC's policy to encourage and promote development of independent power producers for the generation of electricity to meet consumer need.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*B. The IA*\n-----------\n\n283.\n\nThe IA set out the tenus upon which MIME on behalf of KOC would support the implementation of the power plant construction.\n\n[REDACTED] As part of this support. MIME agreed under Section 3.1 of [REDACTED]\n\n*C. The DOG*\n------------\n\n289.\n\nThe Deed of Guarantee (\"DOG\") was signed on 27 March 1998 by the Claimant and by the Ministry of Economy and Finance on behalf of the KOC. Section 1.1 of the DOG provides:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**XII.3 Analysis of the Factual Timeline**\n------------------------------------------\n\n*A. 1994 - April 1998*\n----------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n292.\n\nThe DOG was signed on 27 March 1998.\n\n*B. Amendment No. 1*\n--------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*C. The Bribery Allegation*\n---------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded that the course of action determined by [REDACTED] led to the IFC suspending its involvement with the project until the matter had been cleared up. The Claimant has not shown evidence to contradict this finding. [REDACTED] actions -whether right or wrong - clearly caused delay which was attributable to the Claimant, and not the Respondent or EDC.\n\n*D. Amendment No. 2*\n--------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n312.\n\nOne of the reasons asserted by the Claimant for a lessening of interest in the project on the part of the Respondent at this time was the suggestion that energy derived from a contract entered into with a company called [REDACTED] made the deal with the Claimant less attractive. The Tribunal cannot support this allegation. There were by this stage substantial delays in this project, and as a consequence, given the energy shortfall serious power outages in Cambodia. The deal with [REDACTED] was entered into as a temporary fix, pending the coming on line of electricity from the C-4 Project. Both EDC and KOC had a duty and a responsibility to provide power and this could not be put on hold.191\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*F. IFC Involvement*\n--------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*G.

Events Subsequent To Notices of Default*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**XII.4 Analysis of Claimant\u2019s Claims**\n---------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nThe position of the Claimant has shifted in various ways at different times during the proceedings. In the merits phase of the proceedings, the Claimant\u2019s written pleadings in Parts 1 and 2 of its Memorial on the Merits and its Reply on the Merits amounted to over 630 pages of closely argued fact and law, and this does not take into account the voluminous exhibits, the skeleton arguments and the post-hearing submissions.\n\n378.\n\nAs crystallised in paragraphs 21 to 23 of its Skeleton Argument, the Claimant put its case as follows:\n\n*21. CPC's case is that from 1998 - 2004, KOC and EDC through the acts and omissions of C4 project opponents, repeatedly and deliberately breached and renounced their contractual obligations to CPC with the intent and effect of preventing CPC from financing and building the power plants. By these actions KOC repudiated the IA and EDC repudiated the PPA. CPC accepted their repudiation in June 2004 and commenced this arbitration in July 2009.*\n\n*22. The efforts of C4 project opponents within KOC and EDC were intended to cause the death of the C4 project by a thousand cuts, although such efforts were punctuated by a series of deep cuts that speak for themselves.*\n\n*23. In CPC's case, the deep cuts include: (a) the Finance Ministers resistance, communicated to CPC's lenders, to performing KOC's undertaking to give a guarantee of payments, (b) a bribery allegation lodged against BHA and [REDACTED] in an effort to take down both in a single act, (c) KOC's and EDC's failure to act on a variety of collectively significant legal requirements to ready the project for financial closing, (d) intimation from EDC of its unwillingness to proceed on the basis of the agreed prices and technology, coupled with direct interference by EDC with CPC's lenders through communication seeking to enlist their assistance in renegotiating the PPA, (e) KOC and EDC entering into inconsistent arrangements to purchase power from Vietnam and committing to make significant capital investment in building a transmission line that would render the C4 power plant a stranded investment, (f) EDC renouncing the PPA and, when ordered by KOC to reaffirm it, establishing a situation that left the PPA in continuous limbo from February 2000 through June 2001 while continuing to lobby KOC to cancel the C4 project, and (g) KOC enacting an Electricity Law that revoked CPC's power generating licence and a bridge to other contractual rights and then refusing to address these matters after CPC raised them.*\n\n379.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr Keck made it clear that the Claimant was no longer relying upon any implied terms of the PPA and IA, and thus the allegations made have to be considered in the light of the relevant express terms of the agreement set out above.193 Having set out the allegations made, it is necessary for the Tribunal now to consider each one and evaluate it.\n\n*A. Finance Minister's Resistance to the DOG*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nIt is alleged that the Finance Minister's resistance to performing the KOC's undertaking to give the DOG and his communication of this resistance to potential lenders is itself a breach. The fact is that it took a little time to persuade the KOC that it was normal for a host state guarantee to be given in these circumstances. But ultimately, the guarantee was in fact given.\n\n381.\n\n[REDACTED] stated that investors would have been concerned about the actions of the Finance Minister even after he had signed the DOG.194 The Tribunal understands [REDACTED] view.\n\n382.\n\nOn the other hand, this has to be looked at in its temporal context. The DOG was signed on 27 March 1998. A lot of things happened after that about which both Parties complained. There is no concrete evidence on record that potential investors were in fact put off by the deal due to the initial reluctance of the Minister to sign the DOG.\n\n383.\n\nHowever, investors were entitled to conclude that once a sovereign State had executed the DOG, it would honour it if subsequently called upon to do so.\n\n384.\n\nIt is true that prior to the guarantee, [REDACTED] wrote this to [REDACTED] on 28 January 1998: [REDACTED] That may have been what Mr Steele thought at the time. There is no evidence of the World Bank trying to scuttle the project. Importantly, as a result of intervention by [REDACTED], a guarantee was signed.\n\n385.\n\nWhat is more, [REDACTED] wrote to [REDACTED] on 17 April 1998 to inform him that [REDACTED]\n\n386.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal cannot see how observations by the Minister prior to his signature of the DOG can amount to a breach. The Respondent agreed to provide a guarantee. It did so by signing the DOG. It is difficult to see how any breach has occurred in relation to the DOG.\n\n387.\n\nIn so far as it is contended that any delay in giving it was a breach, the Tribunal respectfully disagrees. In any event, there is no possible causal link between any such delay and the damage claimed.\n\n*B. Bribery Allegation*\n-----------------------\n\n388.\n\nThe bribery allegation is said to be a breach. However, although the Tribunal is prepared to accept that the allegation emanated from within Cambodia, there is simply insufficient evidence to attribute it to KOC or EDC. But in any event, as set out earlier, the major part of the delay that resulted from having to deal with the allegation was in fact caused by [REDACTED] insisting that a US DOJ investigation be undertaken as opposed to an internal legal review, as requested by [REDACTED] and IFC.\n\n389.\n\nOn the record is the letter dated 22 October 1999 from [REDACTED] President and CEO of [REDACTED] to [REDACTED], which states [REDACTED]\n\n390.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that an internal inquiry would have been speedier and thus would have reduced the period of delay. The Tribunal cannot see how this delay, even if causative of loss, can be attributed to KOC or EDC.\n\n*C. Failure to Act on Legal Requirements for Financial Closing*\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nIt is alleged that EDC failed to act on a variety of collectively significant legal requirements to ready the project for financial closing. This is a somewhat unparticularised allegation, the origin of which is in paragraph 502 of the Claimant's Memorial on the Merits. The Tribunal is not satisfied that the Claimant has established this complaint bearing in mind all the other delays to which reference has been made or will be made in this Award.\n\n392.\n\nThis allegation pre-supposes that the Claimant itself was ready for financial closing and this would obviously entail having finance available. The Tribunal will return to this crucial issue later as it is relevant to almost all of the Claimant's allegations.\n\n*D. EDC's Unwillingness to Proceed on Agreed Price and Technology and Its Interference with Lenders*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe first part of this allegation depends to a large extent on whether EDC was entitled as a matter of law to impose conditions for its agreement to extend time. Because the PPA was not terminated by any of the parties after the effective date expired, a *\"limbo period\"* existed in which there was no effective date to work towards. The difficulties to which the situation gave rise, as far as the Claimant is concerned, are illustrated in the following exchange:\n\n*MR KECK: [...] Then we get to 15th May. The government has directed EDC to give us an extension, to give Cambodia Power Company an extension. So they give them a 15-day extension to 30th May.*\n\n*THE PRESIDENT: Extend what?*\n\n*MR KECK: The effective date.*\n\n*THE PRESIDENT: But is it the contract? Is it the agreement to negotiate?*\n\n*MR KECK: Well, this is the interesting thing, which is why I would say that certainly, if we're not beginning to pick up that there is some bad faith going on here, this one seems to be a very bright example of it. We have opened up the capacity rate, the utilisation factor, the escalation factor. And even if one could say, Well, if there are only minor adjustments, we can just do those overnight and have a new contract, well, what about this fuel type and more efficient machines? It makes one wonder what was really in the mind of EDC back on 7th February when they wrote that letter, if they didn't really want those things. Certainly it was taken by the IFC to be a significant change in demands. And yet when we come up to it, then they say, You only have 15 days. What are you going to accomplish in 15 days?*\n\n*THE PRESIDENT: That's another matter. I want you to focus on what it is that is being extended to 30th May.*\n\n*MR KECK: I think that what's been extended there, sir, is the agreement to negotiate. But that's not really clear, because now EDC is not really saying it wants to negotiate these things. And I would have taken the view that because we are no longer in a time-of-the-essence period, the amount of time would have been longer than 15 days to do anything anyway. So this thing is really just window-dressing; it doesn't really do anything. It is clear when the government gets involved and says, Extend this thing, the government has something else in mind than what EDC does. They say, Well, that's because he told us he could close at the end of May, back in January, and there is some back-and-forth about whether that was an extension request or whether that was just a projected closing date; you heard evidence on that. But that was all before things were reopened on February 7th anyway.*\n\n*MR LANDA U: Can I just confirm my understanding of how you are characterising it. By this stage, on your case, here is a binding contract to negotiate?*\n\n*MR KECK: Yes.*\n\n*MR LANDAU: Binding, enforceable as a matter of its governing law?*\n\n*MR KECK: As a matter of ...?*\n\n*MR LANDAU: Its governing law, presumably.*\n\n*MR KECK: Yes, and I think with some sense of reasonableness between the parties. I don't think it is a situation where one party could just ...*\n\n*MR LANDA U: Presumably that would be a question of what the governing law will tell you about contracts to negotiate?*\n\n*MR KECK: I think so, and the governing law here I think remains English law.*\n\n*MR LANDA U: So we are into well-known English law as to what rights and obligations there may or may not be in a contract to negotiate?*\n\n*MR KECK: I think that's right.*\n\n*MR LANDAU: So, just to follow through on your characterisation, that means that, notwithstanding that the government directs EDC to give an extension of time for the effective date, that actually is simply a misunderstanding by the government of the operative contract, because at this stage -*\n\n*MR KECK: I think so.*\n\n*MR LANDAU: -- that's the wrong terms of reference, as it were.*\n\n*MR KECK: I think that's right.*\n\n*MR LANDAU: It's now an agreement to negotiate, so this has no contractual effect.*\n\n*MR KECK: That would be my view. We've got some sort of indeterminate time period that's running right now, but certainly it would be quite a bit longer than 15 days.*198\n\nTranscript, Day 9, pages 21-24.\n\n394.\n\nIn the table below the Tribunal sets out the various effective dates for the PPA. As can be clearly seen, there was a gap in time between each expiry and amendment. When an effective date passed, either party had a right to insist on new and varied terms as the price of agreement for the extension. And the delay that had occurred had caused some terms to be out of date such as the escalation factor (see above), which would now kick in far earlier in the life of the project than it would have done had there been no delays.\n\n395.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot see anything wrong in the Respondent attempting to renegotiate these factors or other terms as the price for an extension. The Claimant's allegation that the Respondent attempted to change some of the terms cannot amount to a breach in light of the timelines in this case. When the contractual date had passed, each party had the right to terminate or each had the right to agree on the terms of extension.\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Date signed** | **Effective Date (Section 3.2(d))** |\n| Original Contract | 20 March 1996 |  |\n| Amendment No. 1 | 9 October 1998 | 31 January 1999 |\n| Amendment No. 2 | 9 March 1999 | 31 July 1999 |\n| Amendment No. 3 | 24 August 2000 | 31 December 2000 |\n| Amendment No. 4 | 5 June 2001 | 31 July 2001 |\n\n396.\n\nOn the basis of the timeline of the contract set out above, once an effective date for the PPA passed and no extension was agreed, the contract still existed but could be determined by either party or either party could lay down their own terms in return for an extension.\n\n397.\n\nIf that analysis is correct, then any allegation based on an attempt to change some of the terms cannot succeed. All that would have happened is that one party would have exercised the right it had at that particular point in time having regard to the expiry of the Effective Date. No breach would be involved.\n\n398.\n\nA great deal of emphasis was placed on the fact that EDC/KOC contacted IFC directly. An enormous amount of weight was placed in particular on the letter of 7 February 2000, referred to above. But the Tribunal cannot see why EDC/KOC should not have contacted the IFC directly given the delay in financing and the paucity of information being given to it about progress. In fact, [REDACTED] the Claimant's project finance expert, could not see anything wrong in this direct approach, given the circumstances existing at the time.199\n\nTranscript, Day 7, page 186.\n\n*E. The Vietnam PPA*\n--------------------\n\n399.\n\nAlthough this allegation featured heavily in the Claimant\u2019s pleaded case and the witness statement of [REDACTED], it finds no place in the Claimant\u2019s post-hearing analysis of the evidence.\n\n400.\n\nThe Claimant had alleged that the entering into of a PPA with EVN in July 2000 constituted some form of breach. This allegation began as one of anticipatory breach but subsequently in the Reply it was put as simply part of the overall course of conduct.\n\n401.\n\nThe plain fact of the matter is that Cambodia was in dire need of power. On the basis of independent reports submitted in this arbitration, it is clear that Cambodia had legitimately explored all available sources of power. [REDACTED] agreed that it was reasonable for EDC to be sourcing supply from wherever possible.200\n\nTranscript, Day 7, pages 171-172.\n\n402.\n\nIt has to be emphasised that the Vietnam PPA was not on take-or-pay terms and thus was not incompatible with the Claimant\u2019s PPA. [REDACTED] who gave evidence for the Claimant stated that from the viewpoint of a potential equity investor he did not see any problem with the Vietnam PPA, provided it was not on take-or-pay terms.201\n\nTranscript, Day 2, page 29.\n\n403.\n\n[REDACTED] in the end frankly admitted that he did not consider the Vietnam PPA as a breach of any obligations undertaken by EDC.202 However, he did consider that it might damage the economics of the project.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, pages 211-212.\n\n404.\n\nThere are all sorts of obligations that EDC could have undertaken which might in the long run have affected its ability to pay the Claimant, but it cannot be argued that there was any prohibition on EDC from taking on other commitments of whatever nature. There was nothing in the PPA which prevented that.\n\n405.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the entering into of the PPA with Vietnam was not a breach of any obligation owed to the Claimant and it cannot form the basis of any of the claims made in these proceedings.\n\n*F. EDC Renounced, Left in \"Continuous Limbo\" and Lobbied KOC to Cancel the C-4 Project*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nThe Tribunal has given this allegation very careful thought in light of all the allegations made in this case. The Tribunal has dealt with and will deal with in subsequent paragraphs all the allegations of the Claimant. In the view of the Tribunal, this allegation is no more than a compendium of the other allegations. Taking everything into account, the Tribunal is not of the view that EDC ever unlawfully renounced the PPA. In relation to lobbying, it is clear that there were internal discussions within Cambodia as to the need for and viability of the C-4 Project. But in the end, the Project had the backing of the [REDACTED], all necessary agreements were signed, a sovereign guarantee was given and all necessary extensions were granted. The allegation that EDC established a situation that left the PPA in *\"continuous limbo\"* from February 2000 to June 2001 simply does not withstand scrutiny.\n\n*G. The Electricity Law*\n------------------------\n\n407.\n\nAs noted earlier, [REDACTED] set out the Claimant\u2019s case on force majeure in a letter dated 30 April 2001. There then followed correspondence on the issue and eventually both sides took legal opinions.\n\n408.\n\n[REDACTED] was in error when he said in his first witness statement that he had been unaware of the proposed Electricity Law prior to April 2001. It had in fact been referred to in the original bidding document. It was clearly known to those working on the C-4 Project. [REDACTED] also recognised that the law was no different to any other Electricity Law he had come across. [REDACTED], too, accepted that the Electricity Law was considered as part of Ogden's (a potential funder) due diligence of the C-4 Project.\n\n409.\n\nThere is absolutely no evidence before the Tribunal that any potential investor or lender was concerned about the Electricity Law.\n\n410.\n\nThe weight of all the evidence indicates that this was known at the time, was expected and was not unusual. The Claimant's pre-existing rights were protected by virtue of Article 76 of the Electricity Law in any event. It is also worth noting that the Claimant did not even make an application for a licence under the new scheme, and its reason for not doing so was totally unconvincing. Section 2.4 of the PPA imposed on the Claimant the obligation to obtain any necessary consents and approval. Section 3.1 of the IA requires compliance with any licensing requirements.\n\n411.\n\nOn 15 May 2001, [REDACTED] wrote to [REDACTED] who had just been appointed as chairman of the EAC which had been created by the new Electricity Law. He sought a meeting with [REDACTED] to discuss the force majeure issue.\n\n412.\n\nOn the same day he wrote to EDC with regard to a meeting next day to discuss the execution of Amendment No 4. In this letter he discussed the tariff reduction that had been required by KOC.\n\n413.\n\nOn 22 May 2001, MIME wrote to [REDACTED] rejecting the force majeure allegation and pointing out that Article 76 of the Electricity Law protected [REDACTED]\n\n414.\n\nOn 24 May 2001, [REDACTED] wrote to EDC regarding revisions to Amendment No. 4 aimed at meeting requirements of EDC's letter of 22 May, and submitting a revised Amendment No. 4 for reconsideration by EDC.\n\n415.\n\nOn 24 May [REDACTED] wrote to [REDACTED] and stated:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n416.\n\nOn 4 June 2001, EDC wrote to [REDACTED] proposing to amend the utilisation factor (\"***UF***\")as set out therein.\n\n417.\n\nOn 5 June 2001, [REDACTED] wrote to MIME setting out a *\"report on force majeure\".*\n\n418.\n\nOn the same day [REDACTED] wrote to EDC with regard to Amendment No. 4 in which he resubmitted CPC\u2019s offers regarding adjustments to the UF and the corresponding reduced tariff that would be applicable to each UF table.\n\n419.\n\nOn 16 June 2001, [REDACTED] wrote to [REDACTED] stating:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n420.\n\nOn 19 June 2001, [REDACTED] wrote to [REDACTED] and informed him that:\n\n(1) The allegation of force majeure was not acceptable;\n\n(2) EAC under Article 76 would not issue any abridging or expanding measures which would affect the rights or obligations of a contract in existence;\n\n(3) MIME\u2019s authorisation dated 18 August 1998 for CPC to establish and operate a 60 WM power plant on the C-4 site was valid: and\n\n(4) An application for a licence was required to be made and if CPC encountered any serious difficulty it could seek assistance from MIME.\n\n421.\n\nOn 26 June 2001, [REDACTED] reiterated his stance on force majeure to [REDACTED]\n\n422.\n\nOn 30 June 2001, [REDACTED] wrote to EDC stating:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n423.\n\nOn 2 July 2001, [REDACTED] wrote to [REDACTED] readdressing his concerns about the Electricity Law and underscoring his concerns relating to possible restrictions on the transfer and assignment of shares and the licence, as well as matters relating to dispute resolution.\n\n424.\n\nOn 16 July 2001, [REDACTED] for CPC wrote to the Minister for [REDACTED] setting out the legal argument in support of force majeure.\n\n425.\n\nOn 19 July 2001, the Minister for [REDACTED] wrote to [REDACTED] in response to three of his previous letters stating [REDACTED]\n\n426.\n\nThe Tribunal's conclusion on this issue is that the Claimant made a desperate attempt to use the new Electricity Law to buy further time. It is quite clear on the evidence that the Electricity Law did not take anyone by surprise. It was in fact welcomed by the investment community. It was never an event of force majeure, which argument was correctly objected to by EDC, and affords the Claimant no comfort in these proceedings whatsoever.\n\n*H. Financing*\n--------------\n\n427.\n\nThe crucial issue in this case was whether the Claimant ever had its financing arranged. If it did not, the Tribunal cannot see how it can be argued that anything KOC/EDC did or did not do could have impacted on financial closing. If financing was not arranged, what were the chances that it would have been but for the activities of EDC/KOC?\n\n428.\n\nOn the totality of the evidence, it is clear to the Tribunal that throughout this project there were substantial uncertainties relating to debt and equity financing for the project.\n\n429.\n\nAs has already been stated, there were obvious commercial risks in financing this project in Cambodia at this time. Those risks led to potential lenders such as [REDACTED] and CDC withdrawing interest in the project. In August 1999, the [REDACTED] (at the time an important potential lender) wrote to [REDACTED] saying that it was [REDACTED] Concern was expressed at EDC's credit worthiness - a concern shared by [REDACTED] himself.\n\n430.\n\nBy late 1998, [REDACTED] argued it was necessary to *\"reorganise the lending\"*. At this time it will be recalled that IFC had suspended work on the project.\n\n431.\n\nBy the summer of 1999, IFC returned to the fold. [REDACTED] accepted in cross- examination that in January 2000 none of the major documents required for financial closing had been finalised.204 Further, by late 1999 [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] had yet to begin their due diligence. [REDACTED] formerly of [REDACTED], part of the [REDACTED], agreed that there was real doubt as to whether OPIC would ever join as a lender. [REDACTED] himself agreed that by late 1999 OPIC was not *\"on board\"*.205\n\nTranscript, Day 3, page 143.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, page 114.\n\n432.\n\nIn his first witness statement, [REDACTED] had expressed the view that KEXIM and OPIC [REDACTED] By [REDACTED] own admission, this was not an accurate statement. It was one of several such inaccuracies in his testimony.\n\n433.\n\nAnother major factor was that, even if everyone had lent that which they had originally suggested, there would still have been a shortfall in required funds, as was put by the Respondent in its post-hearing brief:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nThe Tribunal is not satisfied on the evidence it has heard from [REDACTED] that [REDACTED] was a realistic investor.\n\n434.\n\nHaving regard to the state of interest in the project and the progress made to secure the necessary financing, it is clear that any case based on the allegation that EDC/KOC interfered with or prevented the financing from being made available, cannot be sustained. There was still a lot to do and no certainty at all that anyone would in fact sign up to the deal.\n\n435.\n\nThe withdrawal of the IFC for reasons unconnected with any actions on the part of EDC/KOC, was the death knell for the project. Mr Lobit\u2019s notes of a telephone conversation he had with [REDACTED] on 19 June 2000 state that [REDACTED]\n\n436.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, after the withdrawal of IFC there was no real or substantial chance of financing this project.\n\n437.\n\nIt was, however, argued that IFC could have been re-engaged. The experts disagreed. However, the best evidence before the Tribunal is the statement of [REDACTED] that in 17 years at IFC this had never occurred. The Tribunal also observes that this position is confirmed by [REDACTED] notes of his conversation with [REDACTED], which indicate [REDACTED] saying on 19 June 2000 that [REDACTED] On this issue the Claimant fails to meet its evidential burden.\n\n438.\n\nAnother factor that the Tribunal considers relevant to the failure to obtain finance is [REDACTED] inexperience in a major power project development. During the Main Hearing, [REDACTED] confirmed that the C-4 Project was his first power project. He was asked by Mr Turner to explain paragraph 15 of his Third Witness Statement, in which he wrote [REDACTED] acknowledged that his and [REDACTED] skill sets were not related to power station building experience.209\n\nTranscript Day 2, pages 60, 63 and 66-67.\n\n439.\n\nAlso at the Main Hearing both project finance experts ([REDACTED]), as well as [REDACTED], agreed that it was unusual to enter into a power pinchase agreement and an implementation agreement without first having the project finance in place. But this is exactly the way [REDACTED] approached the C-4 Project. Further, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] agreed that BHA lacked experience in power purchase projects.210\n\nTranscript Day 2, pages 107 and 176-177.\n\n440.\n\nAnother example of [REDACTED] inexperience was the original proposal to unload highly volatile naphtha to the Phnom Penh cargo port, which was a dry cargo port.\n\n441.\n\nAdding to the lack of experience in power plant development was the manner in which [REDACTED] worked with his project partners or potential equity partners. His working approach evidently had a tendency to create deep-rooted antipathy. This problem manifest in [REDACTED] letter to [REDACTED] on 22 October 1999, which merits quotation in full:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n442.\n\nBut this was not an isolated flare-up in which these points of contention were openly aired. Previously, on 1 December 1998, [REDACTED] wrote to [REDACTED] about differences concerning how to deal with the bribery allegation that echoed the type of complaints expressed in his October 1999 letter:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n443.\n\nMoreover, these types of issues were not confined to [REDACTED] dealings with [REDACTED]. They also resonate in [REDACTED] relations with HEI Power Corp. as can be seen from the letter dated 6 May 1996 from [REDACTED]of that company to [REDACTED]:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*I. Designation of EDC*\n-----------------------\n\n444.\n\nSection 16.3 of the PPA is the arbitration clause which has been set out above. Section 16.3(b)(iii) is relevant to this inquiry and for the sake of convenience the Tribunal will set it out again:\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n445.\n\nThe Claimant contends that this provision imports an obligation on KOC to designate EDC as a sub-division or agency of the State for the purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. If it contains such an obligation then clearly it has not been complied with. Further, in the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration KOC argued that EDC was not *\"an agency or sub-division of KOC\"* and the Tribunal did not find it necessary to decide that issue.\n\n446.\n\nThe point at issue now is a straightforward question of construction. Does this clause impose an obligation on KOC to designate EDC or is it merely an obligation to notify the Centre if and when that event occurs?\n\n447.\n\nIn its decision on jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that as a matter of fact EDC had not been designated to the Centre by KOC as required by Article 25(1) of the Convention. The Tribunal declined to accept the argument that designation was complete at the time when MIME agreed to procure designation upon implementation.\n\n448.\n\nIn paragraphs 258 and 259 in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded:\n\n*258. Therefore, even if the Claimant had persuaded the Tribunal that designation was properly communicated to the Centre, the Tribunal is not convinced that the wording of the arbitration provisions that were so communicated demonstrated KOC\u2019s unequivocal designation of EDC as its agency.*\n\n*259. In conclusion on this point, it is clear to the Tribunal that not only does designation require a public communication by the State, but that such designation must also represent an unequivocal intention of the State to consider the entity as its agency or sub-division.*\n\n449.\n\nThe Tribunal now returns to the wording of Section 16.3(b)(iii). Having considered all the arguments helpfully deployed on this issue by both sides, the Tribunal concludes that the provision involves an obligation of notification of something yet to occur. On a plain reading it cannot be taken to mean that KOC had already designated EDC/MIME, or that KOC was undertaking to CPC to do so. This provision and the one immediately preceding it are clearly looking to the future. KOC was promising to perfect any designation, by notifying the Centre - if and when any such designation occurred, which it had clearly not at the time of execution of the PPA. Even if the Tribunal is wrong about this, it is difficult to see what possible loss the Claimant could have suffered consequent on such a breach.\n\n450.\n\nAccordingly, the claim made on the basis of a breach of Section 16.3(b)(iii) of the PPA fails and it is thus unnecessary for the Tribunal to consider the interesting question whether in fact EDC was \"*an agency or sub-division\"* of KOC.\n\n*J. Termination*\n----------------\n\n451.\n\nAlthough neither party has contended that the agreements are still on foot, it may be helpful if the Tribunal briefly records its analysis of their termination.\n\n452.\n\nOn the basis of the Tribunal's conclusions, the notices of default served on both MIME and EDC were clearly not valid. Indeed, it is apparent on the evidence that attempts were made thereafter to continue with the contract. There is then a long silence from the Claimant between 2004 and 2009 when it hurriedly commenced these proceedings at a time which it acknowledged might give it certain limitation problems. It is difficult to point to any specific moment in time when the Claimant purported to accept the alleged repudiation of EDC and KOC.\n\n453.\n\nHowever, in the light of the various positions of the parties in this arbitration, it is clearly common ground that these contracts are no longer in effect. Both parties, albeit on different grounds, have asserted that all project contracts in this case have been terminated.\n\n*K. Conclusion*\n---------------\n\n454.\n\nAs will be readily apparent from all of the above, the Tribunal rejects all of the Claimant's claims in the merits phase of this arbitration. The Claimant has been quite unable to pinpoint any provision in the relevant agreements in respect of which the Respondent or EDC has committed a breach, or for which under the cross default provisions, KOC is liable.\n\n455.\n\nThe breach of contract claim fails completely. The Claimant's claim against KOC based on breaches of customary international law is quite unsupportable. As there was no breach of the agreements by EDC, there was no conduct on the part of KOC which can form the basis of an international law claim. None of the evidence presented in this case can support any claim based on the *\"state responsibility doctrine\"* whether put as expropriation or in any other way. The Claimant does not rely upon any implied term of the agreements. In so far as the Claimant relies on an accumulation of conduct on the part of EDC and KOC, this does not advance the Claimant's case in the absence of an identifiable breach of a specific provision of the agreements. None has been established.\n\n456.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear to the Tribunal that the Claimant's claims in the merits phase of this arbitration have been a moving target in that they have developed and then changed during the course of the various rounds of memorials and in the oral phase of the arbitration.\n\n457.\n\nThe Tribunal has some sympathy with the position of the Respondent who has had to deal with a changing case. The Claimant's approach has been of a scatter gun nature and although set out at enormous length, when stripped of hyperbole, exaggeration and inaccuracy, it is \"*as a thing writ in water\"*. As the Tribunal said at the outset, it recognises that [REDACTED] and his team feel EDC/KOC prevented this deal, on which they had been working for many years, from coming to fruition. Unfortunately, many of the problems in getting this project to the finishing post have to be laid at the door of the Claimant.\n\n458.\n\nAs has already been said, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] were complete novices in the complex field of large-scale power generation projects. [REDACTED] clearly had some connections in Cambodia, but neither she nor [REDACTED] had any experience in the financing of an international power project, let alone all the other myriad issues that needed addressing for successful conclusion.\n\n**XIII. RESPONDENT\u2019S COUNTERCLAIM, CLAIMANT\u2019S CLAIM FOR DAMAGES AND MISCELLANEOUS OTHER POINTS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nMr Turner accepted in his oral closing submission that if the claim was to fail in its entirety there would be no need to consider the Respondent's counterclaim.213 Accordingly, the Tribunal makes no findings of fact or law on the counterclaim, which is dismissed.\n\n460.\n\nThe Tribunal having dismissed all of the Claimant's claims on the merits, it is not necessary for this Tribunal to analyse the Claimant's claims for damages or the KOC's damage limitation clause defence.\n\n461.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided all points that it considers necessary for the decision to dispose of the claims and counterclaim.\n\n**XIV. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n462.\n\nPursuant to an order of the Tribunal, the Parties submitted their cost schedules on 29 November 2012. The Claimant's costs schedules were accompanied by an 11 page letter together with authorities. As directed by the Tribunal, the Parties divided up their costs to cover costs and expenses incurred during the following phases of the arbitration: (a) jurisdiction; (b) the Lobit Application and (c) the merits. The Parties' claims for costs may be summarized in United States dollars as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Claimant** | **Respondent** |\n| **Jurisdiction** | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] |\n| **Lobit Application** | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] |\n| **Merits** | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] |\n| **Total** | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] |\n\n463.\n\nIn addition, each party has contributed USD 600,000 to ICSID to cover the costs of the proceedings.\n\n464.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention confers on the Tribunal a wide discretion to deal with the costs and expenses of the proceedings. It is not unusual for ICSID tribunals to follow the principle that \"costs follow the event\". It could be said that the three events in this case are represented by the three phases of this arbitration.\n\n465.\n\nThe Respondent clearly won in the Lobit Application as well as on the merits. On the jurisdictional issue, both Parties enjoyed some success. The Claimant managed to sway the Tribunal to permit this arbitration to proceed despite the jurisdictional objections of the Respondent, but on the other hand the Respondent was successful in persuading the Tribunal that EDC for the various reasons stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction this should no longer be a party.\n\n**XIV.1 Jurisdiction**\n----------------------\n\n466.\n\nIn the jurisdictional phase the Claimant succeeded most because it persuaded the Tribunal that this arbitration could continue in the form it had been commenced save that EDC was dismissed from the proceedings due to the lack of designation. Leaving each Party to pay for its own costs of the jurisdictional phase, although superficially attractive, would not reflect fully the outcome of the phase. Taking everything into account and exercising the Tribunal\u2019s undoubted wide discretion as to costs, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent shall contribute USD 250,000 towards the Claimant's legal costs of the jurisdictional phase.\n\n**XIV.2 Lobit Application**\n---------------------------\n\n467.\n\nWith regard to the Lobit Application, the Tribunal can see no reason why the Claimant should not pay the Respondent's reasonable costs as quantified by the Tribunal.\n\n468.\n\nThe claim for Freshfields' legal fees on this issue totals USD 674,452 and they also incurred USD 90,745 in expenses. This totals USD 765,197.\n\n469.\n\nAs the Lobit Application raised matters of California law, the services of Quinn Emanuel were engaged by the Respondent. This was perfectly proper and necessary. Their fees amounted to USD [REDACTED] and they incurred expenses of USD [REDACTED] making a total of USD [REDACTED]. It seems that Quinn Emanuel spent approximately [REDACTED] hours on the Lobit matter. In contrast Mr Valle and his colleagues from the firm Valle Makoff LLP, who were engaged by the Claimant on issues related to Californian law, spent approximately [REDACTED] hours.\n\n470.\n\nThe Respondent also claims USD [REDACTED] in respect of the fees of Sciaroni and Partners, bringing the total of fees and expenses of the Respondent's legal representation on the Lobit Application to USD [REDACTED]\n\n471.\n\nIn the exercise of the Tribunal's discretion and having regard to all the circumstances surrounding this issue, the Tribunal considers it fair and reasonable for the Claimant to pay the Respondent the sum of USD 1,000,000 in respect of the Lobit Application.\n\n**XIV.3 Merits**\n----------------\n\n472.\n\nFor their legal representation on the merits phase, Freshfields charged USD [REDACTED] together with expenses of USD [REDACTED].\n\n473.\n\nFor this phase, Quinn Emanuel billed USD [REDACTED] in fees together with USD [REDACTED] in expenses.\n\n474.\n\n[REDACTED] charged USD [REDACTED] together with expenses of USD [REDACTED].\n\n475.\n\nThe experts called by the Respondent have charged a total of USD [REDACTED] together with expenses of USD [REDACTED]. The various experts retained by the Claimant charged a total of just over USD [REDACTED].\n\n476.\n\nThus the Respondent\u2019s total claim in United States dollars for the merits claim may be broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Fees** | **Expenses** | **Total** |\n| **Freshfields** | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] |\n| **Quinn Emanuel** | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] |\n| [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] |\n| **Experts** | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] | [REDACTED] |\n|  |  |  | [REDACTED] |\n\n477.\n\nIn the exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s discretion, it considers that it would be fair and reasonable in all the circumstances of the case if the Claimant paid USD 4,500,000 in respect of the Respondent\u2019s legal costs of the merits phase of the arbitration.\n\n478.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal orders Claimant to pay the Respondent USD 5,500,000 in respect of the Respondent\u2019s costs and expenses relating to the Lobit Application and the merits phase of this arbitration. The Claimant is entitled USD 250,000 credit for its fees and expenses of the jurisdictional phase leaving a net balance in favour of the Respondent of USD 5,250,000, which the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent.\n\n**XIV.4 Costs of Proceeding**\n-----------------------------\n\n479.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses are the following:214\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | USD |\n| Mr Neil Kaplan | 486,275.10 |\n| Mr John Beechey | 158,739.24 |\n| Mr Toby T. Landau | 203,871.56 |\n| ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses (estimated) | 267,448.54 |\n| Total | **1,116,334.44** |\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\n480.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses are paid out of the advances made by the Parties.215 As a result, each party\u2019s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 558,167.22. The Tribunal estimates that approximately one third of these costs relates to the proceeding on jurisdiction and two thirds to the Lobit Application and the merits. As a result, the Claimant should pay two thirds of the Respondent\u2019s costs of the proceeding, *i.e.* USD 372,111.29 to the Respondent.\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n481.\n\nThe Tribunal further orders that the Claimant shall pay interest at a rate of 2% per annum, compounded annually, on the amounts due under this Section XIV, from the date of dispatch of this Award until the date of payment.\n\n**XV. AWARD**\n-------------\n\n482.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal unanimously decides that:\n\n**(i)** The Respondent did not breach the IA, PPA or DOG directly or indirectly through the actions of EDC;\n\n**(ii)** All of the Claimant's other claims are dismissed;\n\n**(iii)** The Respondent's counterclaim is dismissed;\n\n**(iv)** The Claimant shall pay to the Respondent USD 5,250,000 for the Respondent's legal costs and expenses in this arbitration, plus interest on this amount as from the date of dispatch of this Award at the rate of 2% per annum compounded annually until the date of payment;\n\n**(v)** The Claimant shall pay to the Respondent USD 372,111.29 in respect of the Respondent's costs of these proceedings, plus interest on this amount as from the date of dispatch of this Award at the rate of 2% per annum compounded annually until the date of payment;\n\n**(vi)** All other claims and requests by the Parties are dismissed.\n\nDate: 8 April 2013\n\nANNEXES\n-------\n\n[483].\n\n1.
