PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n----------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe Tribunal incorporates by reference the procedural history set forth in paragraphs 3 to 13 of the Interim Award on Jurisdiction dated 3 December 2010.\n\n4.\n\nBy a Notice of Arbitration dated 30 October 2009, the Claimants commenced arbitration against Poland pursuant to Article 8 of the Treaty on the Mutual Encouragement and Protection of Investments between France and Poland, signed on 14 February 1989, which entered into force on 10 February 1990 (\"Treaty\" or \"BIT\") and Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976 (\"UNCITRAL Rules\").\n\n5.\n\nArticle 8 of the Treaty provides:\n\n1. Any dispute relating to investments between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the two parties concerned or, failing that, through internal means of recourse.\n\n2. However, disputes relating to the divestment measures referred to in article 5, paragraph 2, particularly those relating to possible compensation, its amount and terms of payment and the interest payable in the event of a delay in payment, shall be settled according to the following conditions:\n\nIf any such dispute has not been settled amicably within six months from the time when the matter was raised by one of the parties to the dispute, it shall, at the request of either party, be submitted to arbitration. It shall be settled definitively in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in resolution 31/98 of 15 December 1976.\n\nWhen both Contracting Parties have become parties to the Convention on the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States, signed at Washington on 18 March 1965, any such dispute which has not been settled amicably within six months from the time when the matter was raised by one of the parties to the dispute shall be submitted for arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\n3. The arbitral tribunal shall rule in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law.\n\n6.\n\nOn 20 May 2010, the Claimants filed a Statement of Claim (\"Statement of Claim\"), in which they contended, *inter alia,* that (1) they have been dispossessed of their investment in violation of Article 5(2) of the Treaty; and (2) Poland has breached Articles 3, 4(1) and 5(1) of the Treaty, including the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment; non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory treatment; national treatment; and full protection and security (\"Non-Expropriation Claims\"). The Claimants argued that, by virtue of the MFN clause in Article 4(1) of the Treaty and the wider dispute resolution provisions contained in Article 8 of the Poland-Finland BIT, this Tribunal has jurisdiction to resolve their Non-Expropriation Claims (the \"MFN Issue\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 31 May 2010, the Claimants filed a corrected version of the Statement of Claim, a corrected translation of Exhibit C-18, and a corrected version of Exhibit C-106, the Witness Statement [REDACTED]\n\n8.\n\nOn 21 June 2010, Poland raised preliminary objections to the Claimants\u2019 claims, including that: (1) the Claimants do not have a protected investment relevant to their claim under Article 5(2) of the Treaty; and, (2) the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to resolve the Claimants\u2019 Non-Expropriation Claims by virtue of the MFN clause in Article 4(1) of the Treaty. Poland sought bifurcation of the proceedings in relation to those objections, to which the Claimants objected.\n\n9.\n\nOn 16 July 2010, the Respondent filed a request for the production of documents. On 30 July 2010, the Claimants filed their response to this request. On 17 August 2010, the Tribunal issued its decision on this document production dispute.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 20 July 2010, Poland submitted that the Claimants were also seeking to assert a further and separate basis for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to the applicable law clause found at Article 8(3) of the Treaty. Poland requested that this issue also be dealt with in a preliminary phase. By letter dated 28 July 2010, the Claimants objected to Poland\u2019s qualification of their position on Article 8(3) of the Treaty, and the bifurcation of this issue. The Parties exchanged further correspondence on this matter on 29 July and 2 August 2010.\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 August 2010, the Tribunal communicated its preliminary decision to bifurcate the proceedings to address, as a first matter, the MFN Issue. On 27 August 2010, the Tribunal issued a full Decision on Poland\u2019s Application for Bifurcation of the Proceedings, in which it confirmed its decision to bifurcate the proceedings with respect to the MFN Issue only.\n\n12.\n\nBetween August and October 2010, the Parties submitted pleadings on the MFN Issue. A hearing was held on 8 October 2010. As memorialised in the provisional timetable of 27 August 2010, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal would communicate its decision on the MFN issue to the Parties as soon as practicable after the hearing to facilitate the Parties\u2019 forthcoming submissions, with a reasoned award to follow. On 14 October 2010, the Presiding Arbitrator notified the Parties of the Tribunal\u2019s decision as follows:\n\nHaving fully considered the Parties\u2019 written submissions and oral arguments presented in connection with Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections, the Tribunal is unanimously of the view that its jurisdiction has not been expanded by virtue of the MFN provisions in Article 4(1) of the Franco-Polish Investment Treaty signed on 14 February 1989.\n\nAs requested by both sides, and pursuant to the Decision on Bifurcation and Provisional Timetable of 27 August 2010, the Tribunal provides this notification of its decision for the Parties\u2019 guidance. A reasoned award on the matter will follow as soon as possible, with the target date of 3 December 2010 set in the Provisional Timetable.\n\nAs provided in Section 3 of the Decision on Bifurcation, any arguments concerning applicable law, including the effect of Article 8(3) of the Investment Treaty, will be addressed in the context of the merits phase of this case as to which hearings have been fixed for July 2011.\n\n13.\n\nOn 3 December 2010, the Tribunal issued its reasoned Interim Award on Jurisdiction to the same effect as its written notification to the Parties of 14 October.1\n\nInterim Award on Jurisdiction, paras. 121-122. For the full procedural history leading up to the rendering of the Interim Award on Jurisdiction, *see* paras. 16-23 therein.\n\n14.\n\nFollowing an exchange of correspondence between the Parties, on 19 November 2010, Poland requested an order that the Claimants produce the auditor\u2019s notes to the financial accounts of Servier\u2019s Polish subsidiaries from 2006 to 2009, to which the Claimants objected. In a decision dated 27 November 2010, the Tribunal declined to order production of the auditor\u2019s notes.\n\n15.\n\nOn 25 October 2010, the Claimants filed a request for production of documents. On 6 December 2010, the Respondent filed its response to the Claimants\u2019 request. In keeping with the provisional timetable, Servier filed a supplementary request for document production on 7 January 2011, to which Poland responded on 28 January 2011. By letter dated 8 February 2011, Servier submitted the unresolved document production issues to the Tribunal for determination, and Poland submitted its comments thereon on 9 February 2011.\n\n16.\n\nOn 2 February 2011, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to rule that partially redacted meeting minutes submitted by Poland under Exhibits R-90 and R-104 were not protected by legal privilege and should be fully disclosed. Poland objected to this request on 9 February 2011.\n\n17.\n\nAfter allowing the Parties further opportunity to comment, in a decision dated 22 February 2011, the Tribunal ruled on (1) the Parties\u2019 outstanding document production issues; and (2) the Parties\u2019 dispute concerning Exhibits R-90 and R-104. Following further disagreement between the Parties concerning the Respondent\u2019s redaction of documents responsive to Servier\u2019s request of 7 January 2011, on 23 March 2011, the Tribunal issued further directions as to the extent to which such documents could be redacted.\n\n18.\n\nOn 23 December 2010, the Respondent filed its Objections to Jurisdiction and Statement of Defence (\"Statement of Defence\").\n\n19.\n\nOn 29 March 2011, the Claimants filed their Reply Memorial (\"Reply\"). In it, they requested the Tribunal to exclude from the record of this arbitration: (1) Exhibits R-130 through R-144 inclusive; (2) the witness statement of Dr. Nopitsch-Mai; (3) Section 7 (paras. 71-91) of the witness statement of Professor Mazurek; and (4) those portions of Poland\u2019s Statement of Defence which expressly rely on the above-mentioned documents.\n\n20.\n\nOn 30 May 2011, the Claimants filed their Supplement to Claimants\u2019 Reply Memorial as agreed by the Parties on 19 May 2011 (\"Supplement\"). The Supplement addressed the Respondent\u2019s supplemental disclosure of documents made on 12 April 2011, in response to the Tribunal\u2019s document production orders of 22 February and 23 March 2011.\n\n21.\n\nOn 10 June 2011, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder Memorial (\"Rejoinder\"). At paragraph 438 of its Rejoinder, Poland requested the Tribunal to reject Servier\u2019s request noted above in paragraph 20.\n\n22.\n\nOn 21 June 2011, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing telephone conference call with the Parties. On 24 June 2011, the Tribunal issued Hearing Protocols.\n\n23.\n\nOn 20 June 2011, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that Dr, [REDACTED] be unable to attend the hearing due to a conflicting inspection. On 23 June 2011, the Respondent complained that the Claimants could have provided earlier notice of Dr. [REDACTED] unavailability, and had control over the scheduling of the conflicting inspection. Thus, the Respondent filed an application to disregard the written witness statement of Dr. [REDACTED] because he would not be able to be cross-examined at the hearing. On the same date, the Claimants retorted that they had had no control over the scheduling of the inspection.\n\n24.\n\nOn 30 June 2011, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Tribunal would reserve judgment on what weight, if any, to accord to Dr. [REDACTED] written statement.\n\n25.\n\nHaving duly considered the matter, the Tribunal declines to reject the testimony of Dr. [REDACTED] but grants it only such weight as deserved under the circumstances.\n\n26.\n\nFrom 4 to 8 July 2011, the Tribunal held a hearing at the PCA\u2019s facilities in the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands.\n\n27.\n\nOn 11 July 2011, the Respondent filed an updated Application to Exclude, in which it requested the exclusion of new arguments asserted by the Claimants for the first time at the hearing on 8 July 2011, citing the instructions issued by the Tribunal during the hearing.\n\n28.\n\nOn 15 July 2011, the Claimants submitted their response to the Respondent\u2019s Application to Exclude.\n\n29.\n\nOn 20 July 2011, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order on Post-Hearing Procedural Items. The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit post-hearing briefs providing a summary of each side\u2019s position, including rebuttal of any arguments presented during the hearing. Initial post-hearing submissions, up to 18,200 words each, were to be filed simultaneously by 29 July 2011. The second post-hearing submissions were to be filed by 19 August 2011, limited to 9,100 words each and to observations and arguments responsive to matters raised in the first post-hearing round. The Tribunal also ruled that the Parties could comment on the principles to be applied in determining the reasonableness of requests for costs in two rounds of submissions. The first submissions on costs would be limited to 4,500 words and due on 20 September 2011, while the second submissions on costs would be limited to 2,250 words and due on 30 September 2011. The Tribunal further decided that either side could require documents referenced in an expert report to be available as part of the record. Finally, the Tribunal declined to grant the Respondent\u2019s Application to Exclude the Claimants\u2019 arguments with respect to Article 24 of the EU Pharmaceutical Directive and the alleged investment in Poland by Laboratoires, and directed that the Parties address both matters in their post-hearing submissions.\n\n30.\n\nOn 27 July 2011, the Tribunal granted the Parties\u2019 joint request for extension of the deadline for filing post-hearing briefs to 31 July 2011.\n\n31.\n\nOn 31 July 2011, the Parties filed their first post-hearing submissions.\n\n32.\n\nOn 19 August 2011, the Parties filed their second post-hearing submissions.\n\n33.\n\nOn 20 September 2011, the Parties filed their first submissions on costs.\n\n34.\n\nOn 30 September 2011, the Parties filed their second submissions on costs.\n\n**III. RELEVANT TREATY PROVISIONS**\n-----------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Preamble of the Treaty provides:\n\nThe Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Polish People\u2019s Republic, hereinafter referred to as \"the Contracting Parties\",\n\nDesiring to strengthen economic cooperation between the two States and to create favourable conditions for French investments in Poland and Polish investments in France,\n\nConvinced that the promotion and protection of such investments are likely to stimulate transfers of capital and technology between the two countries in the interest of their economic development, [...].\n\n36.\n\nArticle 4 of the Treaty provides:\n\n1. Each Contracting Party shall accord in its territory and maritime areas to investors of the other Party, in respect of their investments and activities connected with such investments, the same treatment as is accorded to its own investors or the treatment accorded to investors of the most favoured nation if the latter is more advantageous.\n\n2. Such treatment shall not, however, include privileges which a Contracting Party extends to the investors of a third State by virtue of its participation in or association with a free trade area, customs union, common market or any other form of regional organization or organization for mutual economic assistance.\n\n3. This Agreement shall not include privileges extended by a Contracting Party to any third State by virtue of an agreement for the avoidance of double taxation or any other agreement with respect to taxes.\n\n37.\n\nArticle 5 of the Treaty states:\n\n1. Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party shall be fully and completely protected and safeguarded in the territory and maritime areas of the other Contracting Party.\n\n2. The Contracting Parties shall not take any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other measures which would have the effect of divesting investors of the other Party, either directly or indirectly, of investments belonging to them in its territory or maritime areas, except for reasons of public necessity and on condition that these measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking.\n\nAny divestment measures that may be taken shall give rise to the payment of prompt and adequate compensation, the amount of which shall correspond to the real value of the investments in question on the day before the measures are taken or made known to the public.\n\nSuch compensation, its amount and its method of payment shall be determined no later than the date of divestment. The compensation shall be effectively realizable, paid without delay and freely transferable. It shall yield, up to the date of payment, interest calculated on the basis of the appropriate rate of interest in force at the time of divestment.\n\n3. Investors of either Contracting Party whose investments have suffered losses as a result of war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency or uprising in the territory or maritime areas of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Party treatment no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of the most favoured nation. They shall in any event receive adequate compensation.\n\n38.\n\nArticle 8 of the Treaty provides:\n\n1. Any dispute relating to investments between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the two parties concerned or, failing that, through internal means of recourse.\n\n2. However, disputes relating to the divestment measures referred to in article 5, paragraph 2, particularly those relating to possible compensation, its amount and terms of payment and the interest payable in the event of a delay in payment, shall be settled according to the following conditions:\n\nIf any such dispute has not been settled amicably within six months from the time when the matter was raised by one of the parties to the dispute, it shall, at the request of either party, be submitted to arbitration. It shall be settled definitively in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in resolution 31/98 of 15 December 1976.\n\nWhen both Contracting Parties have become parties to the Convention on the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States, signed at Washington on 18 March 1965, any such dispute which has not been settled amicably within six months from the time when the matter was raised by one of the parties to the dispute shall be submitted for arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\n3. The arbitral tribunal shall rule in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\nA. POLAND \u2019 S REGULATORY REGIME AND HARMONISATION OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Applicable laws and regulations**\n--------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nStarting in 1991, Poland enacted a series of legislative and administrative reforms to harmonise its regulation of pharmaceuticals with that of the European Union (then called the European Communities). Thus, under the 1991 Europe Agreement between Poland and the European Communities,2 Poland was required to approximate its \"existing and future legislation to that of the Community,\" while the Polish legislature was obliged to \"use its best endeavours to ensure that future legislation is compatible with Community legislation,\" including the \"protection of health and life of humans.\" At that time, Polish pharmaceutical law was governed mainly by the 1991 Act on Pharmaceuticals, Medical Materials, Pharmacies, Wholesale Warehouses and Pharmaceutical Inspection (\"1991 Pharmaceutical Act\").\n\nThe 1991 Europe Agreement established an association between the European Communities and their Member States, on the one hand, and the Republic of Poland, on the other. *See* Statement of Defence, para. 48.\n\n40.\n\nPrior to its accession to the European Union in 2004, and in anticipation of the EU\u2019s Pharmaceuticals Directive,3 Poland proceeded to enact legislation in accordance with its obligations under the Europe Agreement. Thus, on 6 September 2001, Poland adopted the Pharmaceutical Law and the Act on Introductory Provisions of the Pharmaceutical Law (\"Act on Introductory Provisions\"). The Pharmaceutical Law and the Act on Introductory Provisions entered into force on 1 October 2002, and together they represent the main sources of regulation of pharmaceutical products in Poland.\n\nExhibit C-82, Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Community code relating to medicinal products for human use (OJ L 311, 28.11.2001).\n\n41.\n\nAncillary to those two statutes is the Act on the Office for the Registration of Medicinal Products, Medical Devices and Biocidal Products dated 27 July 2001 (\"Registration Office Act\"), which created the Office for Registration of Medicinal Products, Medical Devices and Biocidal Products (\"Registration Office\"). The Registration Office has broad administrative discretion in the areas of pharmaceutical approval and regulation.\n\n42.\n\nUnder the 1991 Pharmaceutical Act, a drug could be sold in Poland only after the issuance of a Resolution by the Registration Committee, which resulted in the drug\u2019s entry into the Register of Medicinal Products (\"Register\"). Similarly, pursuant to the EU-compliant Pharmaceutical Law, the seller of a drug in Poland must possess a marketing authorisation for that drug, issued either by the competent Polish authorities or by the European Commission. Depending on the issuing authority and issuance procedure, the marketing authorisation can be valid either in Poland specifically or in the European Union as a whole. Failure to procure a marketing authorisation for a drug on the Polish market entails regulatory and other sanctions under Polish law.\n\n43.\n\nThere is disagreement between the Parties as to whether the Pharmaceutical Law introduced \"more stringent\" requirements than the 1991 Pharmaceutical Act that it replaced. The Respondent argues that the EU-imposed requirements introduced a stricter regulatory regime,4 and points out that Servier itself referred to the \"more stringent\" requirements of the Pharmaceutical Law and the Act on Introductory Provisions.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Statement of Defence, para. 85.\n\n44.\n\nAt this point it is worth recounting the various procedures by which a seller of a pharmaceutical in Poland can procure a marketing authorisation. Broadly speaking, there are four such procedures, one of which is \"national,\" *i.e.,* governed by Polish law, and three additional ones that are governed by EU law.\n\n45.\n\nThe national procedure in Poland consists of the submission of a request for a mar keting authorisation, accompanied by the necessary documentation, to the Minister of Health through the Registration Office. Under the Pharmaceutical Law, the required documentation includes\n\n...detailed quantitative and qualitative particulars of the active substance or active substances and other substances, referring to the medicinal product, and their usual common names [i.e. the International non-proprietary names (INN) recommended by the WHO] and if such names do not exist their chemical names;\n\n...\n\nresults, summaries, and reports for:\n\na) pharmaceutical, i.e. physicochemical, biological or microbiological, studies,  \nb) preclinical, i.e. pharmacological and toxicological, studies,  \nc) clinical trials....\n\nAfter reviewing the request and associated documentation, the Registration Office is responsible for preparing a report thereon for the Minister\u2019s review. If the Minister grants the request, the marketing authorisation is valid for five years.\n\n46.\n\nThe Polish Pharmaceutical Law also contains provisions mandating the denial of an application for a marketing authorisation. Specifically, under Article 30(1) of that law:\n\nThe minister competent for health matters shall issue the decision refusing to grant the authorisation if:\n\n1) the application and the dossier submitted in support of the application do not comply with the requirements laid down in the Act;\n\n2) the results of tests and studies demonstrate that the medicinal product is characterised by risk of use unbalanced by the expected therapeutic effect within the framework of the indications, contraindications and prescribed dosing stated in the application;\n\n3) the results of tests and studies demonstrate that the medicinal product does not have the declared therapeutic efficacy or the therapeutic efficacy is insufficient;\n\n4) the results of tests and studies demonstrate that the qualitative or quantitative composition or another qualitative characteristic of the product is not as declared;\n\n5) the withdrawal period specified by the MAH is not long enough to ensure that the foodstuffs derived from the treated animals do not contain products posing a potential risk to human health or such period is not sufficiently evidenced.\n\n47.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n48.\n\nAccording to Poland, Servier\u2019s argument relies on a false factual premise.8 Poland's decisions not to renew the marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup were grounded explicitly on [REDACTED]9. The Respondent does dispute that neither application sought a new marketing authorisation, or that its decisions with respect to harmonisation applications were not permitted to be grounded in [REDACTED]. However, Poland denies that harmonisation applications were governed by a lesser standard than new applications, or were subject to a less stringent evaluation. Rather, following a full review of the dossiers for each drug, Poland was required to satisfy itself that the registrations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup complied with the standards of quality, safety, and efficacy under the *acquis.* Its decisions with respect to each drug were based on [REDACTED]10.\n\nRejoinder, para. 25.\n\nRejoinder, para. 20.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 40-42.\n\n49.\n\nAside from the Poland-specific national procedure, there are three types of EU law-based authorisation procedures: \"centralised,\" \"decentralised,\" and \"mutual recognition.\" The centralised procedure is governed by EU Regulation 726/2004, and involves obtaining a marketing authorisation directly from the European Commission or, in rare instances, from the Council of the European Union on the basis of a recommendation by the European Medicines Agency (\"EMA\"). Such an authorisation is valid in all EU Member States and in the European Free Trade Association (\"EFTA,\" *i.e.,* Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland). Only certain categories of drugs are eligible for this procedure. Neither Detralex nor Eurespal Syrup, the medicines at issue in this case, is eligible for marketing authorisation via the centralised procedure.\n\n50.\n\nThe decentralised procedure, which involves simultaneous applications to the European authorities and the Polish Ministry of Health, is similarly inapplicable to Detralex and Eurespal Syrup because it concerns only new requests for marketing authorisation, and not renewal applications.\n\n51.\n\nFinally, the mutual recognition procedure applies when marketing authorisation is sought in Poland, which is called the \"concerned Member State,\" for a drug that already has received such authorisation in another EU or EFTA Member State, the \"reference Member State.\" The applicant must notify both the concerned and the reference Member States of its application. Within 90 days of that notification the reference Member State must supply the concerned Member State with an assessment report as to the pharmaceutical in question. The applicant, meanwhile, must supply all information required under the centralised procedure in addition to a declaration of consistency of its documentation with that provided by the reference Member State. After receiving these materials, the concerned Member State is obliged to recognise the marketing authorisation granted by the reference Member State within 90 days unless \"reasonable concerns arise that marketing authorisation of the medicinal product concerned might pose a risk to public health.\" If the concerned Member State harbours such concerns, it is required to submit them in detail to a group of representatives or all Member States. If those representatives fail to reach a resolution within 60 days, the matter is referred to the EMA and the European Commission for binding settlement.\n\n52.\n\nAll four of the above marketing authorisation procedures require complete documentation with respect to the pharmaceutical concerned. The extent of such documentation, however, can vary depending on whether the application concerns an original drug, a generic drug, or a drug with \"well-established use.\" Thus, while the European Pharmaceutical Directive requires a full scientific dossier for an original drug, including clinical trial data, that requirement is dispensed with if the drug is a \"generic\" of a medicinal product already authorised. Similarly, a full scientific dossier is not required if the active substance or substances in the pharmaceutical has been in systematic and documented use for at least ten years, and is of recognised efficacy and acceptable safety level.\n\n53.\n\nAs mentioned, the substantive evaluation of market authorisation applications in Poland is conducted, as an initial matter, by the Registration Office. That office prepares and submits a report on each application to the Minister of Health, who has the power to approve or deny the application. The Registration Office\u2019s evaluation proceeds in seven stages, some of which may be completed simultaneously: i) formal verification or validation of the application; ii) quality assessment (chemical, pharmaceutical, and biological documentation); iii) safety assessment (Periodic Safety Assessment Report and clinical report thereon); iv) safety/efficacy assessment (toxicological and pharmacological documentation); v) safety/efficacy assessment (clinical documentation); vi) evaluations of product information, including the Summary of Product Characteristics, package leaflet and labels for packaging; and vii) preparation of the report of the President of the Registration Office for the Minister of Health.\n\n54.\n\nThere are two noteworthy aspects of the Registration Office review process. First, under the Act on Introductory Provisions, a decision on a marketing authorisation application, including a renewal application, must be taken within six months. If, however, the Minister of Health is unable to make a determination on a renewal within this time period, the marketing authorisation can be extended for twelve months. Similarly, if a marketing authorisation holder submits an incomplete renewal application under the Pharmaceutical Law, the duration of its authorisation may be prolonged to allow it to submit the missing documentation. In any event, the Registration Office is not required to process incomplete applications.\n\n55.\n\nSecond, while the Registration Office employs teams of specialized scientists, it may involve external independent experts to assess a portion of a scientific dossier submitted with an application. Both internal and external expert teams must prepare protocols with positive and negative assessments of the materials they have reviewed, which assessments are then taken into account in preparing the report of the President of the Registration Office to the Minister of Health.\n\n56.\n\nThe Minister of Health conducts an independent review of the report of the Registration Office and has discretion to make a decision contrary to the Office\u2019s assessment. As mentioned, the Minister\u2019s discretion is limited by the mandatory grounds for rejection of an application under [REDACTED]. Furthermore, the Minister may not amend or approve partially an application. Finally, if the Minister denies an application, the applicant can request reconsideration, which the Minister performs with the assistance of the Registration Office. If the negative assessment stands, the applicant can resort to the Voivodship Administrative Court.\n\n**2. Poland\u2019s harmonisation process for previously authorised pharmaceuticals**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nPoland\u2019s accession to the EU on 1 May 2004 occurred subject to certain conditions contained in the Act of Accession, which was annexed to the Treaty of Accession. Article 24 of the Act of Accession referred to transitional arrangements that would apply to the newly acceded Member States. Annex XII, which applied specifically to Poland, contained a list of pharmaceutical products that had received marketing authorisation without concomitant compliance with EU law. According to the Annex, marketing authorisations for those products would remain valid in Poland until the Polish authorities could evaluate them anew under EU law, or until 31 December 2008, whichever occurred earlier, without any prejudgment as to their compliance with EU law requirements.11\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 77-80.\n\n58.\n\nNotably, the Act and Treaty of Accession did not specify a framework for the re-evaluation under EU standards of the pharmaceuticals listed in Annex XII of the Act of Accession. Discretion was thus provided to the Member States to establish their own internal procedures for such re-evaluation. Poland\u2019s methodology was to treat the re-evaluation as a market authorisation renewal governed by Articles 29 and 30 of the Pharmaceutical Law, as modified by Article 14 of the Act on Introductory Provisions. In other words, Poland\u2019s authorities elected to conduct a full review of the dossiers of the drugs appearing in Annex XII of the Accession Act.12\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this review process involved 7,349 products listed in Annex XII, of which 6,771 were harmonised, including 12 of Servier\u2019s drugs, while 401 were withdrawn, and 177, including Detralex and Eurespal Syrup, were rejected. Statement of Defence para. 84; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 40.\n\n59.\n\nThe Parties accept that the Act of Accession required Servier to \"harmonise\" the marketing authorisations for its drugs sold in Poland by supplying Poland with additional evidence for those drugs. The Parties disagree, however, as to [REDACTED].\n\n60.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n61.\n\nSimilarly, the Parties dispute what legal framework is applicable to the \"harmonisation\" of Servier\u2019s pharmaceuticals. According to Servier, the Polish Office of Registration stated that it would apply \"the laws in force as of the accession day, that is, 1 May 2004.\"18 Servier interprets this statement as referring only to the laws in force on 1 May 2004, and not beyond that date. Poland denies that laws adopted subsequent to that date were not relevant to the review and harmonisation process.\n\nReply, paras. 48-49 (quoting Exhibit C-29, Power Point presentation by Registration Office employee Dr. Sarna, at 2).\n\n62.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**3.

This registration 2004 [REDACTED]. On 1 October 2002, Detralex's registration certificate of 27 May 1999 automatically became a marketing authorisation (\"1999 Marketing Authorisation\") by operation of Article 14(1) of the Act on Introductory Provisions.24\n\nStatement of Defence, para.92 [REDACTED]\n\n67.\n\nServier filed the Detralex Harmonisation Application to renew Detralex\u2019s 1999 marketing authorisation on 8 January 2004. The application specifies [REDACTED].\n\n68.\n\nThe 1999 Marketing Authorisation was prolonged twice during the harmonisation process in order to allow for the Detralex Harmonisation Application to be fully assessed and for necessary additional evidence to be filed by Servier. The first extension was made through Decision No. RR/1668/1633/04, extending the 1999 Marketing Authorisation until 30 June 2005. The second extension was made on 10 June 2005 through Decision No. RR/2377/05 which extended the validity of the 1999 Marketing Authorisation until 31 December 2008, the limit contemplated by the Act of Accession.29\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 98.\n\n69.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n70.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n71.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n72.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**2.

The Minister did so by Decision No. OR/0114/08 dated 19 December 2008. The Minister also denied Servier\u2019s application for reconsideration on 25 February 2009.46\n\nAccording to Servier, for example, the Registration Office\u2019s tentative decision of 28 November 2008 was delivered to it \"shortly before\" the 18 December 2008 meeting, while the clerks of the Office stated during the meeting that the Office had formed a view that it would not be able to discuss further. Statement of Claim, paras. 130-132. By contrast, Poland asserts that Servier received the Registration Office\u2019s 28 November decision sufficiently in advance to be able to respond, which it did \"more than two weeks before this meeting took place.\" Statement of Defence, para. 153.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 156-157.\n\n81.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nC. THE EURESPAL SYRUP HARMONISATION PROCESS\n-------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe active substance fenspiride hydrochloride (or simply \"fenspiride\") was introduced onto the Polish market on 30 January 1998 when Eurespal, in both syrup and tablet form, was first registered. Fenspiride is a treatment for respiratory tract disorders. Both forms of Eurespal were registered pursuant to the old 1991 Pharmaceutical Act. Both forms were prescription only and their respective registration certificates were valid until 31 March 2000. On 17 February 2000, the registration certificates were duly extended to 30 January 2003. On 12 February 2003, pursuant to Article 14(4) of the Act on Introductory Provisions and Article 29(3) of the Pharmaceutical Law, the marketing authorisations for both Eurespal Syrup and Eurespal Tablets were renewed until 30 January 2008.\n\n83.\n\nOn 29 November 2006, Servier submitted the Eurespal Syrup Harmonisation Application, which was received by the Registration Office on 1 December 2006. In that application, Servier sought to renew the marketing authorisation for use in both the adult and paediatric populations. The term \"paediatric population\" refers to patients between the ages of one day and 18 years of age, and is usually divided in subgroups that account for the different characteristics (weight, metabolism, etc.) of the various stages of human development.48\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 229-230.\n\n84.\n\nOn 28 June 2007, the Registration Office\u2019s Clinical Documentation Assessment Section (\"CDAS\") issued its initial assessment, in which it concluded that [REDACTED].\n\n85.\n\nOn 9 August 2007, Servier filed its first supplement of clinical materials, including a statement by a clinical expert [REDACTED]. The CDAS responded on 25 October [REDACTED].\n\n86.\n\nServier submitted a new clinical expert report by [REDACTED] on December 2007. Once again the CDAS issued a report on January 24, 2008, where it observed that [REDACTED]52.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 241 (quoting Exhibit R-89, Assessment of the second supplement of clinical documentation prepared by the Registration Office dated 24 Jan. 2008).\n\n87.\n\nServier filed an updated clinical expert report, prepared again by [REDACTED] and dated 16 August 2008. By that time, a \"Harmonisation Team\" had been established by the Respondent to ensure that all potentially negative decisions by the Registration Office were re-reviewed and that there was a valid basis for any refusal of a harmonisation application. That Team found that [REDACTED]53.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 246 (quoting Exhibit C-82, EU Pharmaceutical Directive, Annex I, Section 5.2.5.1).\n\n88.\n\nOn October 2008, Servier submitted one final set of supplemental materials, including a clinical expert report by [REDACTED] Again this report was found to be [REDACTED]54.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 248.\n\n89.\n\nThus, while the evidence submitted by Servier ultimately was considered [REDACTED] Thus, upon the recommendation of the Registration Office, the Minister of Health issued Decision No. OR/0031/08 on 20 November 2008, denying the Application for Harmonisation of Eurespal Syrup55 [REDACTED]56\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 249-250.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 254.\n\n90.\n\nServier\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the Decision, which was filed on 18 December 2008, was denied by the Minister on 21 May 2009 on grounds of [REDACTED]57.\n\nReply, paras. 97-98.\n\nD.

PELETHROCIN\n--------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Parties dispute the facts surrounding the Polish Government\u2019s licensing in 2002 of a pharmaceutical product called Pelethrocin, by the Greek company HELP S.A. Pharmaceuticals (\"HELP\"), as a generic to Detralex, and Pelethrocin\u2019s subsequent harmonisation.90 The Parties agree that Pelethrocin is represented and marketed in Poland by the Polish company Blubit sp. z.o.o. (\"Blubit\").91 In addition, Servier contends that Blubit is the \"real party in interest\" with respect to Pelethrocin, and that Blubit, rather than HELP S.A., instigated proceedings against Servier concerning Detralex and Pelethrocin.92 Poland for its part denies Servier\u2019s allegations that the agency agreement by which HELP authorised Blubit to represent it in Poland in connection with its registration of Pelethrocin, or the power of attorney granted by HELP to Blubit render Blubit the \"real party in interest.\"93.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 67.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 67; Rejoinder, para. 91.\n\nReply, paras. 89-90.\n\nRejoinder, para. 91.\n\n103.\n\nThe Parties hold divergent views as to the Polish legal framework governing generics at the time of Pelethrocin\u2019s registration. Servier cites to Article 15 of the Pharmaceutical Law. Linder the Pharmaceutical Law, a generic product may be registered without the clinical trial and other scientific data demonstrating safety and efficacy that is required from the original producer. The generic producer may also sell the generic as \"equivalent to\" the original product.94 However, it must be shown for the generic that the active ingredient is exactly the same as that of the original, and that the generic is bioequivalent to the original *(i.e.,* that ingestion of the generic produces comparable levels of the active ingredient in patients\u2019 bloodstreams).95\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 70.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 69, 71.\n\n104.\n\nBy contrast, Poland contends that the \"more stringent and EU-compliant\" Pharmaceutical Law was not the basis for Pelethrocin\u2019s registration.96 That is, although the Pharmaceutical Law was enacted on 6 September 2001, it did not enter into force until 1 October 2002. Actually, the Law provided that, until 30 June 2003, applications for registration would continue to be made under the 1991 Pharmaceutical Act.97 Indeed, the registration certificate for Pelethrocin indicates that it was registered on 24 April 2002 under the 1991 Pharmaceutical Act.98 Under this Act, the Registration Committee \"had a broad discretion to \u2018consider as sufficient, in part or in full, the results of laboratory tests and clinical trials as provided by the manufacturer.\u2019\"99\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 294-295.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 296, 299.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 295.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 296 (quoting 1991 Pharmaceutical Act).\n\n105.\n\nThe Parties also disagree over the composition of Pelethrocin. Servier states that it learned of the registration of Pelethrocin in May 2003, when it received a letter from the Polish Chief Pharmaceutical Inspectorate, indicating that the marketing authorisation holder for Pelethrocin had tested Detralex and found that [REDACTED].\n\n106.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n107.\n\nServier argues that Poland\u2019s decision to register Pelethrocin as a generic to Detralex, without requiring a full dossier of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, was contrary to the Pharmaceutical Law105. [REDACTED]\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 75, 77.\n\n108.\n\nThe harmonisation application for Pelethrocin as a generic of Detralex was filed on 27 December 2007 and granted a year later.110 Servier states that, although the Diosmin Advisory Group found that Pelethrocin did not meet the qualitative requirements of the Phar. Eur., it granted the application and ordered Blubit to change the documentation to state the active ingredient as Diosminum 500 mg and to change the application category to well-established use.111 Moreover, in November 2008, Poland granted Blubit\u2019s application for permission to supplement its harmonisation application after marketing authorisation had been granted. Harmonisation renewal was granted on 10 December 2008 \"despite a lack of information on the manufacturing method, the test methods and reference standards, the composition of the actual product and a range of other issues.\"112\n\nReply, para. 92; Rejoinder, paras. 96-97.\n\nReply, para. 93.\n\nReply, paras. 94-96.\n\nF. DIOSMINEX\n------------\n\n109.\n\nThe Parties agree that Annex XII of the Accession Treaty contains a \"grandfathering\" provision that permits medicinal products validly marketed in Poland before accession to continue to be marketed in Poland after accession, until harmonisation. The products were simply required to be listed in Annex XII, and to be harmonised, or reviewed for compliance with EU standards, by 31 December 2008.113\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 80-81, 87; Statement of Defence, paras. 292, 304.\n\n110.\n\nHowever, Servier states that the Polish authorities included in Appendix A to Annex XII a \"large number of local products that lacked any marketing authorisation at time of signing the Accession Treaty [on 16 April 2003], and in many instances did not even physically exist at the time when the list was prepared.... [T]he only \u2018evidence\u2019 of their existence was... an application to register a non-existent product under the previous rules in Poland.\"114 The Polish Ministry of Health then issued marketing authorisations for many of these products in the last days before accession, with recommendations to provide documentation and study results at a later point.115 Servier alleges that these marketing authorisations with recommendations were granted \"despite unequivocal advice from lawyers in the Ministry and the Office of Registration that doing so was contrary to Polish law.116 In response, Poland accuses Servier of providing an incomplete and misleading translation of the Audit Protocol it cites in support of its argument, because Servier omitted certain paragraphs which find that the issuance of those authorisations actually was valid under Polish law.117 Servier posits, however, that in 2006 the Polish Supreme Chamber of Control also criticised these authorisations, and the Polish Administrative Courts have found them to be \"legally not compliant\", although \"diverging opinions\" have also been expressed.118\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 88-89; Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 26-27.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 90-94; Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 26-27.\n\nReply, para. 74 (quoting Exhibit C-138, Protocol of Control carried out by the Supreme Chamber of Control at the Office for Registration of Medicinal Products, Medical Devices and Biocides in Warsaw).\n\nRejoinder, paras. 72-74.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 95, 96, n. 124; Statement of Defence, paras. 303-304.\n\n111.\n\nAs discussed in more detail further below, on 22 December 2010, the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"CJEU\") issued a judgment finding that Poland\u2019s issuance of marketing authorisations with recommendations, although consistent with Polish law, violated EU law where the recommendations were only satisfied after Poland\u2019s accession.119 The Parties disagree over numerous aspects of the CJEU proceedings, including the import of certain arguments by Poland,120 and the implications of the CJEU\u2019s judgment on the marketing authorisation for the drug Diosminex.121\n\nReply, paras. 70-73; Rejoinder, paras. 67-68; Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 26.\n\n*See* Reply, para. 71; Rejoinder, paras. 69-71.\n\nReply, para. 70; Rejoinder, para. 67.\n\n112.\n\nThe Polish drug Diosminex, currently the main market competitor of Detralex, is among the products registered under the \"authorisation with recommendations\" procedure described above. The application for Diosminex was submitted on 30 September 2002 under the 1991 Pharmaceutical Act.122 Servier states that the information submitted in support of its authorisation was \"minimal\", while the recommendations issued in respect of it were that \"the applicant produce in the future a copy of the drug master file, a verified statement of the active ingredient, a detailed description of the method of production of the medicinal product, expert reports showing bioequivalence of Diosminex with the original drug and tests of the composition of Diosminex.\"123 The Diosminex marketing authorisation was issued the day before accession, 30 April 2004, with the condition that the drug could be marketed only after compliance was demonstrated with the recommendations issued.124 Eleven days earlier, on 19 April 2004, the Registration Office requested the submission of critical documents and data in connection with the authorisation of Diosminex within seven days, and stated that all remaining documentation requirements would be described in the authorisation.125 Servier complained to the Ministry of Health several times regarding the registration of Diosminex, stating in one letter that it constituted a \"gross breach of law.\"126\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 299-300.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 97.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 300, 302, 304.\n\nReply, para. 76.\n\nRejoinder, para. 128 (quoting Exhibit C-22).\n\n113.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the chemical composition of Diosminex. According to Servier, after the registration of Diosminex, it could not be shown that the product was bioequivalent to Detralex, and Poland subsequently waived the requirement.127 Servier asserts, further, that the documents produced in this arbitration have not shown that Diosminex contains the same active ingredient as Detralex.128 According to Poland, however, in the same February 2007 letter to the Ministry of Health in which Servier complained that the registration of Diosminex constituted a \"gross breach of law,\" [REDACTED].\n\nReply, para. 78.\n\nReply, para. 79.\n\n114.\n\nThe Parties agree that Diosminex was not available on the Polish market until 2 February 2007, after the Polish authorities confirmed that it had fulfilled its recommendations.132 Servier states that the Polish Ministry of Health declined to consider the merits of Servier\u2019s challenge to the Diosminex authorisation, because Servier allegedly did not have a legal interest in raising such a challenge\u2014a decision which was criticised by the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw in its judgment of 12 March 2009.133 Despite the Administrative Court\u2019s determination, on reconsideration of Servier\u2019s motion, the Ministry of Health again rejected Servier\u2019s challenge.134\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 100; Reply, para. 80.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 101-103.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 104.\n\n115.\n\nThe harmonisation application in respect of Diosminex was filed on 4 December 2007, on the basis of \"well established use\" rather than as a generic to Detralex.135 Its active substance was stated to be diosmin; however, Servier points out the clinical studies provided with the Diosminex application actually concerned Detralex and MPFF, not diosmin.136 According to Servier, the Diosmin Advisory Team engaged in limited discussion of the merits of the Diosminex application. The minutes of the 7 February 2008 Diosmin Advisory Team meeting refer to a \"decision... issued already some time ago to classify the drug to the well-established use category\"\u2014of which decision, however, there is no record in the files of the Diosmin Advisory Team or in the Diosminex harmonisation file.137 Servier states that the only discussion of the substance of the Diosminex application \"appears in a conclusory resolution during the meeting on August 11, 2008 that the name of the active substance of Diosminex should be Diosminum 500mg, in line with European Pharmacopoeia terminology and that the application should be classified in the well-established use category.\"138 A final assessment of documentation, undertaken by the Registration Office on 6 November 2008, shows that further \"supplementations by way of post-registration amendments\" were required after Dosminex\u2019s authorisation.139 Diosminex\u2019s harmonisation renewal was granted on 16 December 2008.140\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 104; Reply, para. 81.\n\nReply, para. 81.\n\nReply, paras. 82-83.\n\nReply, para. 84.\n\nReply, para. 85.\n\nReply, para. 86.\n\n116.\n\nPoland denies each of these factual allegations. Regarding the minutes of the 7 February 2008 Diosmin Advisory Team meeting, Poland argues that these show that the Team \"engaged in a thorough, full and detailed discussion of the various registration issues presented by all diosmin products\"; that the Team \"discussed all diosmin based drugs at the same time\"; and that the \"national origin of various applicants was never discussed during their extensive meetings.\"141 Moreover, Poland notes that statements in Servier\u2019s Reply confirm that the original decision to classify the drug in the well-established use category was made by the Diosminex applicant, LEK-AM, and not by the Polish authorities, which merely reviewed the application.142 Poland asserts that the substance of the Diosminex application was discussed not only during the 11 August 2008 meeting, but again \"in detail\" during the Diosmin Advisory Team meeting of 30 September 2008.143 Addressing Servier\u2019s contention that Diosminex\u2019s renewal was granted by relying on Servier\u2019s scientific studies on MPFF, Poland states that [REDACTED]144.\n\nRejoinder, para. 79.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 80-82.\n\nRejoinder, para. 83.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 84-88.\n\n117.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nG. PROCORALAN\n-------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Parties offer differing accounts of events regarding Procoralan, a drug manufactured by Servier and used to treat angina pectoris, which had received authorisation to be marketed in all 27 EU countries, including Poland, by October 2005.147 In October 2007, Procoralan was removed from a list of reimbursable drugs published by the Ministry of Health in a draft regulation, but was restored to this list on 2 November 2007, after alleged interventions by Servier.148\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 105; Statement of Defence, para. 309.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 106; Statement of Defence, paras. 311, 313.\n\n119.\n\nAccording to Servier, later in 2007, the removal and restoration of Procoralan became the subject of a \"hotly contested debate\" between the newly elected political party and the incumbent administration, which had taken the decisions.149 Servier states that, \"[f]ollowing the election, Polish authorities engaged in a persistent campaign to denigrate the drug and demonstrate (against all evidence to the contrary) that the Procoralan reimbursement decision... was unjustified.\"150 On 14 May 2008, Servier was notified that Procoralan would be the subject of evaluation proceedings before the Polish Health Technology Assessment Agency (\"HTAA\"). Servier states that, the next day, the director of the agency issued an opinion concluding that Procoralan should not be reimbursed, stating that \"a more detailed analysis... [does not] seem[] to be necessary given the evidence on hand so far.\"151 [REDACTED]\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 107.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 107.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 110 (quoting Exhibit C-37, Opinion of the Polish HTAA dated 15 May 2008); *see also* Statement of Defence, para. 314.\n\n120.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n121.\n\nThe Parties also present different accounts of an independent investigation conducted by the Polish Supreme Audit Chamber (\"NIK\"), the results of which are dated 1 July 2008. According to Servier, the investigation was of the \"Procoralan reimbursement matter.\" No misconduct was found in relation to Procoralan, and the public controversy was attributed to the lack of transparency surrounding reimbursement decisions.155 By contrast, Poland states that the NIK actually investigated the \"observance of certain statutory procedures relating generally to the preparation of the Regulation of 2 November 2007 (affecting several drugs in addition to Procoralan), and that the NIK found \u2018a number of irregularities\u2019\" in those procedures.156 Servier counters that, in a decision dated 12 November 2010, the Appellate Prosecutor\u2019s Office in Krakow discontinued its inquiry into charges of corruption relating to the inclusion of Procoralan on the Reimbursement List.157\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 108; Statement of Defence, para. 314.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 318 (quoting Exhibit C-38, Supreme Audit Chamber\u2019s letter to the Minister of Health presenting results of an audit dated 1 July 2008).\n\nReply, para. 62.\n\n122.\n\nThe Parties also offer contrasting versions of the timeline of events surrounding the Detralex and Eurespal non-renewal decisions, in relation to the Procoralan events. Servier states that the Diosmin Advisory Team first discussed Detralex in July 2007, and found that the documentation \"unequivocally indicates the safety of... Detralex.\"158 During the next discussion in February 2008, \"after the political storm concerning Procoralan broke,\" the \"tone was quite different, with denial of harmonisation to Detralex and potential litigation resulting from the group\u2019s decisions suddenly on the agenda.\"159 Servier submits that in June 2008, one month after the HTAA report, Poland suggested to local manufacturers of generics of Eurespal Syrup that they should change the reference product to Pneumorel Syrup, which is the French commercial name for the same drug.160\n\nReply, para. 66 (quoting Exhibit R-77, Coordinator\u2019s Report on the Activit\u00e9s of the Diosmin Advisory Team in July 2007, pp. 1-2).\n\nReply, para. 66.\n\nReply, para. 66.\n\n123.\n\nBy contrast, Poland states that the Registration Office first identified deficiencies with the Detralex Harmonisation Application in a memorandum dated 28 December 2005, in which the office noted that [REDACTED]161. Citing a lack of connection between the events surrounding Procoralan and the issues in this arbitration, on 19 July 2010 Poland requested Servier to confirm in writing that it was \"no longer advancing any claims in relation to their alleged investment in Procoralan and, therefore, the allegations set out in the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim relating to Procoralan are irrelevant to the issues in the case and do not in fact need to be considered by the Tribunal.\"162\n\nRejoinder, para. 59.\n\nExhibit R-220, Allen & Overy LLP letter to SCP Salans dated 19 July 2010; Rejoinder, para. 56.\n\nH. REGISTRATION OF PULNEO, ELOFEN, AND FENSPOGAL SYRUPS\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to certain facts surrounding the issuance, shortly after the Eurespal non-renewal decision, of marketing authorisations for three drugs produced by Polish manufacturers with the same active substance as Eurespal and offered in the same form and dosage. On 3 March 2009, a marketing authorisation was issued to Aflofarm Farmacja Polska Sp. z.o.o. for the product Pulneo, and to Polfarmex S.A. for the product Elofen, both of which, like Eurespal, contain the active substance Fenspiride hydrocholoride, and are offered in syrup form at the dosage of 2 mg/ml. In the marketing authorisation application for each, Eurespal is listed as the reference product, but this was changed on 6 June 2008 and 5 July 2008, respectively, to Pneumorel, which is the name used by Servier in France for Eurespal Syrup.163\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 162-164, 166-168; Statement of Defence, paras. 264-265, 268.\n\n125.\n\nServier states that the Ministry of Health never answered Servier\u2019s letter of 9 April 2009 requesting an explanation as to why Pulneo was registered but Eurespal Syrup was not.164 Similarly, Servier\u2019s 30 April 2009 request to the Ministry for an explanation as to the registration of Elofen was not answered.165 On 23 September 2009, a marketing authorisation was issued to the Polish company Farmaceutyczna Sp\u00f3ldzielnia Pracy \"Galena\" for Fenspogal. The application named Eurespal as the reference product; this was changed, in mid-2008, to Pneumorel.166\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 165.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 168.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 169-170; Statement of Defence, paras. 264-265, 268.\n\n126.\n\nPoland states that the reference product for each of the Polish products was changed by the applicants, because the Pharmaceutical Law required products to be successfully harmonised before they could be used as reference products.167 In addition, under EU law, the benefits and risks of a generic product must be assumed to be the same as the reference product.168 By contrast, under the Polish procedure, Servier\u2019s application for the renewal of a marketing authorisation for an original drug did not permit the Registration Office to assume that the benefits and risks of Eurespal were the same as those of another product. Instead, these were required to be established by the presentation of reliable clinical data.169\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 266-277. Poland states that the Registration Office informed two of the applicants of the possibility of changing their applications because of the expiration of the 210 days for decision on their applications, which was due to delays in the harmonisation of Eurespal.

At the same time, according to an official IMS Health report, in April 2010 Pulneo was ranked among 20 pharmaceutical products having the fastest and largest growth rate in Poland.171\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 173.\n\nI. CJEU DECISION ON DRUG MARKETING AUTHORISATIONS IN POLAND\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nAs noted above, Servier argues that by its judgment dated 22 December 2010, the CJEU found that Poland had violated EU law by including in its Appendix A to Annex XII of the Accession Treaty certain products like Diosminex, for which insufficient documentation had been submitted, or which may not have existed at all. In Servier\u2019s view, the CJEU noted that these products had been hastily granted \"marketing authorisations\" under a procedure that was not reflected in Polish law, and that the \"authorisations\" were conditioned upon the applicant later presenting sufficient documentation to justify placing the product on the market.172\n\nReply, paras. 71-72.\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent counter-argues that Servier misrepresents both the content and import of the CJEU judgment. The judgment makes no reference to what Servier calls \"ghost products\" nor is there a single reference to Diosminex. The CJEU takes issue with two decisions by the Polish authorities in 2004, some four years before Poland decided not to renew marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal syrup. The Court also addresses the registration of certain generics of a drug called Plavix. Moreover, the CJEU found that Poland\u2019s issuance of marketing authorisations with recommendations, while consistent with Polish law, was inconsistent with EU law to the extent those recommendations were only satisfied after Poland\u2019s accession on 1 May 2004. Thus, according to the Respondent, the CJEU judgment is plainly inapposite to the issues at bar.173\n\nRejoinder, paras. 67-74.\n\n**V.

and (2) those property rights are protected investments under the Treaty.179\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 326.\n\n134.\n\nPoland argues that the question whether the Claimants have acquired proprietary rights in any of the alleged investments is a matter of Polish law, not international law.180 Poland cites Article 1 of the Treaty which provides: \"The term \u2018investment\u2019 shall mean assets such as property, rights and interests of any kind related to an economic activity in any sector, in accordance with the legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory...the investment has been made...,\"181 Poland asserts that the Treaty does not provide any guidance as to how a proprietary interest in the protected investments is acquired by an investor, nor to the scope of such rights.182 Thus, Polish law supplements and provides substance to the broad language of Article 1 of the Treaty.183\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 326-338;

Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 120. In this regard, Servier also disputes Poland\u2019s reliance on the arguments made by the U.S. Government in *Methanex* v. *United States of America.* Servier submits, first, that the arguments of the United States arose under a specific NAFTA provision that has no counterpart in this case. Second, the facts of *Methanex* are inapposite, because the measures at issue there did not refer to the actual product produced by the claimant (methanol), but rather to a product called MTBE; thus, no nexus existed between the impugned measures and the claimant. By contrast, the measures at issue in this arbitration specifically concern Servier\u2019s products. Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 118-119; *see also* Reply, para. 200.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n188.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n189.\n\nPoland contends that it is not sufficient for an investor to show a simple causal link between the impugned measure and an investment; there must be proximity, such that the measures directly touch and concern the relevant investments.300 This, Poland argues, is confirmed by the jurisdictional clause in Article 8 of the Treaty that refers to \"[a]ny dispute *relating to investments* between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party...\"301 Poland rejects Servier\u2019s argument that Article 8(2)\u2019s reference to \"disputes relating to the dispossession measures referred to in Article 5, paragraph 2\" requires only a nexus between the dispute and the measures complained of.302 According to Poland, the real question is whether there is a sufficient nexus between Poland\u2019s non-renewal decisions and the Claimed Investments, not between Poland\u2019s non-renewal decisions and the investor.303\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 377-382; Rejoinder, para. 200.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 378; Respondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 5 (Poland\u2019s emphasis).\n\nRejoinder, para. 201; Reply, paras. 197-198.\n\nRejoinder, para. 202.\n\n190.\n\nThus, according to Poland, the measures at issue here are Poland\u2019s decisions not to renew marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup, taken in the \"normal course of [Poland\u2019s] duties as pharmaceutical regulator,\" and based on the drugs\u2019 failure to comply with EU law requirements.304 Servier has not pleaded that the marketing authorisations are a protected investment; Servier has pleaded that [REDACTED].\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 383; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 13.\n\n191.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n192.\n\nContrary to Servier\u2019s allegations, Poland states that it is not seeking to read indirect expropriation out of the Treaty. It concedes that Article 5(2) provides that both direct and indirect expropriation are prohibited except in certain circumstances. However, Poland submits, this does not mean that there is no need to show a legally sufficient connection between the measures and the investment as provided in Article 8(1). The word \"indirect\" merely recognises that an investor\u2019s title need not be directly interfered with; it does not relate to the required nexus.309\n\nRejoinder, para. 204.\n\n***(6) Location of the Investment; cross-border sale of goods***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Servier\u2019s Arguments*\n---------------------\n\n193.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n194.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n195.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n196.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n197.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n198.\n\nIn addition, Servier contends that, under the Pharmaceutical Law, separate authorisations from the Polish government are required for the manufacturing and the import of medicinal products.319 [REDACTED]\n\nReply, para. 189.\n\n199.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n200.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n201.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n202.\n\nFinally, Servier disputes on several bases Poland\u2019s reliance on *ADM* v. *Mexico.* First, in that case, the local company was a joint venture between the two claimants, who were not part of the same group of companies. Second, the case concerned a commodity good (high fructose corn syrup), rather than a branded product. Third, in that case, the Tribunal did award damages to the local company, including lost profits; the only damages not awarded were those claimed for lost sales of high fructose corn syrup produced outside the territory of Mexico. By contrast, no sales outside Poland are at issue. Finally, *ADM* does not represent *jurisprudence constante,* since the Tribunal in the subsequent case of *Cargill* v. *Mexico* reached a different result on similar facts.324\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 114-115.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n203.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n204.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n205.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n206.\n\n[REDACTED]. In so arguing, Poland relies on *ADM* v. *Mexico341* for the proposition that, even where certain activities are carried out in the host State, the Tribunal must analyse whether the claimed losses relate to investments made within the host State. In that case, the Tribunal refused to award damages for lost profits on high fructose corn syrup the Claimants would have produced in the United States and exported to their subsidiary in Mexico but for the tax at issue.342 Similarly, here, the presence of Servier subsidiaries in Poland does not entitle Servier to recover. Rather, to assess its jurisdiction, the Tribunal must determine the \"exact losses\" sought to be recovered, and whether they are attributable to investments in Poland.343\n\n*Archer Daniels Midland Co. and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc.* v. *United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/04/5, Award dated 21 Nov. 2007.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 109.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 110.\n\n***(7) Servier\u2019s Additional Claims***\n-------------------------------------\n\n*Servier\u2019s Arguments*\n---------------------\n\n207.\n\nAccording to Servier, this Tribunal has jurisdiction under Article 8(2) to hear and decide disputes relating to the dispossession measures referred to in Article 5(2) of the Treaty. Servier further submits that:\n\n[i]t is equally apparent that, under paragraph 3 of Article 8, this Tribunal must, in deciding this dispute, apply \"the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law.\" It is beyond contest that \"the provisions of this Agreement\" include Articles 3, 4 and 5 of that Agreement, which include requirements of fair and equitable treatment, national treatment and full protection and security, among others.344\n\nReply, para. 363; *see also* Servier\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 2 Aug. 2010, p. 2 and Servier\u2019s letter to the Tribunal dated 28 July 2010, pp. 2-3.\n\n208.\n\nServier rejects Poland\u2019s allegation that the applicable law clause issue is one of jurisdiction that was disposed of in the Tribunal\u2019s Interim Award on Jurisdiction. Rather, it says, the Tribunal deferred the question to the merits phase of these proceedings.345\n\nReply, paras. 359-361; *see also* Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Poland\u2019s Application for Bifurcation dated 2'7 Aug. 2010, p. 3; Interim Award on Jurisdiction dated 3 Dec. 2010, para. 15; \"[T]he Parties\u2019 arguments concerning the effect of the applicable law dispositions in Article 8(3) of the Treaty would not be determined in a preliminary bifurcated phase, but would be addressed in the merits phase of these proceedings.\"\n\n209.\n\nServier submits that Article 8(3) of the Treaty, along with Article 33(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, sets out the applicable law that the Tribunal must apply to the substance of the dispute.346 According to Servier, the Treaty clearly provides that the applicable law to this case includes all of the provisions of the Treaty\u2014including those on fair and equitable treatment, national treatment, and full protection and security\u2014and international law.347 Servier claims that Poland\u2019s interpretation of Article 8(3) renders ineffective that Article\u2019s express reference to the \"provisions\" of the Treaty.348\n\nReply, para. 362; *see also* Statement of Claim, paras. 267-268.\n\nReply, paras. 366-367, 369; *see also* Statement of Claim, paras. 269-270.\n\nReply, para. 368.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n210.\n\nIt is Poland\u2019s position that the Claimants\u2019 Additional Claims fall outside of Poland\u2019s consent to arbitration as defined by Article 8 of the Treaty.349\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 408, 419.\n\n211.\n\nPoland argues that the Applicable Law Clause does not expand this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to the Claimants\u2019 Additional Claims. Article 8(2) limits the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to disputes relating to expropriation under Article 5(2) of the Treaty. Article 8(3) provides that in exercising jurisdiction and considering the claims relating to such disputes, the Tribunal shall rule in accordance with the other provisions of the Treaty and the rules of international law.350 Poland submits that Servier\u2019s interpretation is untenable because it would mean that an investor who could make an allegation of expropriation sufficient for a tribunal to accept jurisdiction could then also bring claims for breach of other provisions of the treaty and any other applicable rule of international law.351\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 420-421. Poland also asserts that Servier\u2019s position in this respect has \"changed repeatedly\" over the course of the proceedings. Poland objects to Servier\u2019s latest position (as of 23 December 2010) on this point as set out in its Reply to Poland\u2019s First Submission on Objections to Jurisdiction dated 28 Sept. 2010. Poland submits that the arguments contained therein were not made in a timely manner and therefore should not be entertained at this stage *(see* Statement of Defence, paras. 413-418).\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 422-423.\n\n212.\n\nPoland notes that the Inter-State Dispute Clause of the Treaty\u2014Article 11\u2014contains no restriction on the subject matter of disputes but contains an identical applicable law clause. It asserts that it could not have been the Contracting Parties\u2019 intention that the two identical applicable law clauses would mean that the very differently drafted Articles 8 and 11 would have the same effect and scope.352\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 424.\n\n213.\n\nPoland also describes Servier\u2019s argument regarding the effect of the Applicable Law Clause as unprecedented in investment treaty arbitration.353\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 425-429.\n\n214.\n\nFinally, Poland claims that Servier\u2019s approach to this issue should have costs implications, on the grounds that: (1) its argument is manifestly flawed; (2) it has repeatedly changed its position; and (3) it resisted Poland\u2019s attempt to address this issue as a preliminary matter, resulting in wasted time and costs.354\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 431. *See* above n. 350.\n\nB.

In response to this, Servier contends that what is relevant here is not whether the measure can later be undone, but rather what the nature of the measure is.367 State responsibility arises at the time when an act, which is attributable to the State and which constitutes an international wrong, takes place.368\n\nReply, para. 251.\n\nReply, para. 251.\n\n222.\n\nIn response to Poland\u2019s argument that a proper examination of a claim for expropriation begins with a consideration of the vested rights of the investor, and that Servier\u2019s Claimed Investments are not legal rights protected by Polish law *(see supra* para. 131), Servier reiterates that it is the Treaty, not Polish law, that is relevant in assessing whether Servier\u2019s assets are protected investments.369\n\nReply, para. 218.\n\n223.\n\nServier notes Poland\u2019s inclusion as an additional factor in the test for indirect expropriation of \"the extent to which the measures have the effect that the host State or preferred third parties obtain the benefit of the claimant\u2019s investment.\" Servier argues that neither the Treaty nor customary international law require that a State or a \"preferred third party\" benefit from the expropriated assets. Indirect expropriation can occur even if it is not to the benefit of the host State.370\n\nReply, paras. 267-269; Statement of Claim, para. 211.\n\n224.\n\nServier also notes Poland\u2019s inclusion in the test of an assessment as to whether the measure would defeat the legitimate expectations of the investor created through prior conduct of the State.371 Servier argues that (1) no reliance on a State\u2019s prior representations or conduct need to be established to demonstrate the expropriatory nature of a State measure;372 and (2) even if one assumed otherwise, numerous investments are made without reliance on specific representations or conduct by the State, but are based rather on a State\u2019s duty to act lawfully.373\n\nReply, para. 272.\n\nReply, paras. 273-274.\n\nReply, paras. 275-276.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n225.\n\nPoland asserts that Servier\u2019s legal test for expropriation cannot be reconciled with the ordinary meaning of the Treaty text. The use of the terms \"depossession\" (loss of control) and \"pozbawienia wlasnosci\" (deprivation of ownership) in the French and Polish versions of the Treaty respectively imply that a severe degree of interference with control of the investment is required.374\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 449; Rejoinder, para. 219.\n\n226.\n\nFurther, the use of Treaty language which specifically refers to control (in French) and ownership (in Polish) when describing indirect expropriation also supports the view that a loss of value, on its own, is not sufficient to establish a breach of Article 5 (2).375 In other provisions of the Treaty, the drafters specifically referred to losses by using the terms \"pertes\" in French and \"strat\" in Polish. Those terms are absent from Article 5(2). Thus, Poland argues, that the terms \"depossession\" and \"pozbawienia wlasnosci\", connote something distinct from, and more severe than, pure economic loss.376\n\nRejoinder, para. 220; *see also* Respondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 8.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 439 (citing Articles 5(3) and 6(1)(e) of the Treaty where the drafters specifically refer to \"losses\" sustained by investments); Rejoinder, para. 220.\n\n227.\n\nPoland submits that a substantial diminution in the value of an investment alone does not suffice to demonstrate an indirect expropriation under Article 5(2);377 a proper analysis must take into account a range of additional factors (discussed below).378 Poland contends that Servier\u2019s test is not supported by prior authorities on indirect expropriation; tribunals in such cases have consistently endorsed multi-factor tests and have not treated the economic effects of a measure as dispositive.379\n\nRejoinder, paras. 223-225, and Appendix 1; Statement of Defence, paras. 440(i)-(iii).\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 435(i), 438.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 440(i)-(iii); *see also* Rejoinder, paras. 223-225 and Appendix 1.\n\n228.\n\nAs a practical matter, Poland argues that the effect of regulatory measures on the value of an investment will often depend on complex interactions with specific economic variables. Servier\u2019s test, Poland argues, would make a State\u2019s liability for expropriation dependent on factors outside of its knowledge or control.380\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 441.\n\n229.\n\nPoland maintains that the correct assessment of whether a measure has indirectly \"dispossessed\" an investor of its investment under Article 5(2) requires an examination of the following factors:\n\n(a) the nature of the rights of the investor: a claimant must establish that it has a vested right that is protected as a matter of national law and under the Treaty, to the allegedly expropriated asset;381\n\n(b) the degree of interference with the investment: whether the State party\u2019s interference with the rights amounts to a dispossession. In this regard, Poland submits that past tribunals have considered (1) whether the investor has been deprived of its fundamental rights of ownership and/or control over the investment; (2) the consequential loss in the value of an investment; and (3) whether the interference is permanent and irreversible.382\n\n(c) the significance of the character of the measures involved: if a measure can be characterised as involving a good faith exercise of regulatory powers, in the sense of promoting a public purpose in a non-discriminatory and proportional manner, it cannot be treated as giving rise to a dispossession *(see infra* section 2);383 and,\n\n(d) other relevant factors: (1) the extent to which the measures at issue have the effect that the host State or preferred third parties obtain the benefit of the claimant\u2019s investment; and (2) whether those measures defeat the legitimate expectations of the investors created through the prior conduct of the State.384\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 447-448; Rejoinder, para. 213.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 449-450;

543 (on legitimate expectations); Rejoinder, paras. 21 l(iii), 342 *et seq.*\n\n230.\n\nIn sum, Poland submits that Servier must prove that its decision not to renew the marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup \"interfered with the Claimed Investments such that they resulted in a permanent and irreversible deprivation or elimination of [Servier\u2019s] control over, as well as the entire value of,\" Servier\u2019s investments; that the measures did not constitute a valid exercise of Poland\u2019s regulatory powers; and that Article 5(2) of the Treaty was breached notwithstanding Poland\u2019s compliance with Servier\u2019 legitimate expectations, the absence of benefit to Poland, and that Poland\u2019s actions were taken pursuant to the EU Treaty, which both Poland and France have ratified.385\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20; Statement of Defense, paras. 438 *et seq.-, see also* Respondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 8 (arguing that Poland\u2019s measures cannot be deemed expropriatory in the absence of (1) a loss of control over, or interference with, rights protected under Polish law;

Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 4-5. *See also* Reply, paras. 245-249 (setting out Servier\u2019s alleged sales figures since the marketing authorisations came into effect). Servier denies that it was permitted to market Detralex for six months following the expiry of its marketing authorisation as suggested by Poland at para. 222 of its Statement of Defence. Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 4.\n\n248.\n\nAccording to Servier, the record clearly shows that Poland\u2019s measures are permanent and irreversible.439 [REDACTED].\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Submission, para. 13.\n\n249.\n\nAccording to Servier, the Administrative Court in Warsaw has expressly ruled that Poland\u2019s refusal to renew the marketing authorisation for Detralex is permanent and irrevocable. Any renewal of the Detralex marketing authorisation must have occurred on or before 31 December 2008.442 Servier submits that the reasoning of the Warsaw Court would require an identical conclusion with respect to the Ministry\u2019s refusal of harmonisation of Eurespal Syrup.443\n\nReply, paras. 253-254 (referring to Exhibit C-135 Judgment of the Regional Court of Warsaw dated 6 Dec. 2010, pp. 17-18); *see also* Claimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Submission, para. 23.\n\nReply, para. 254.\n\n250.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n251.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n252.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n253.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n254.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n255.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n256.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n257.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n258.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n259.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n260.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n261.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n262.\n\nPoland also adopts the view that because Servier continues to sell Detralex and Eurespal Syrup, its case is built on a future loss in value. It is not inevitable, however, that Servier will incur these losses or that they will be permanent.465 On this point, Poland also alludes to the compensation measures available under the Treaty, under which compensation is to be determined before the date of dispossession and paid without delay. In Poland\u2019s view, Servier seeks to be paid for losses which may not occur and which may be neutralised at a later point in time.466\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 483.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 485.\n\n263.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n(e) The significance of whether the impugned Measures are taken pursuant to an EU Treat y which Poland and France have ratified\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Servier\u2019s Arguments*\n---------------------\n\n264.\n\nServier rejects Poland\u2019s argument that Poland\u2019s Measures \"are, in broad terms, the product of *a joint* French and Polish policy choice,\" expressed in the EU Treaty.468 In Servier\u2019s view, it is absurd to suggest that, because France and Poland are members of the EU, each and every action they take is mandated by their obligations under the EU Treaty or coordinated by them. Servier adds that neither the EU Treaty, nor the EU Pharmaceuticals Directive, requires Poland to favour the local pharmaceutical industry and adopt measures to drive foreign competitors from the market; to the contrary, it disfavours such conduct.469\n\nReply, para. 265 (quoting Statement of Defence, para. 538) (emphasis in the original).\n\nReply, paras. 265-266.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n265.\n\nPoland refers to Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties470 (\"Vienna Convention\"), which provides that in interpreting a treaty, \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties...shall be taken into account, together with the context\" [REDACTED]. That Directive was adopted pursuant to the EU Treaty, which both Poland and France have ratified subsequent to the Bilateral Investment Treaty at issue. Thus, the regulatory requirements imposed by Poland are, in broad terms, the product of a joint French and Polish policy choice; the harmonisation process was concerned with ensuring compliance with EU standards as set out in the EU Pharmaceutical Directive.471 Poland avers that it would be inappropriate to find that the regulatory requirements which both parties agreed to could give rise to an obligation of compensation.472\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, May 23, 1969, 1155 U.N.T.S. 331.\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 537-538; Rejoinder, para. 352.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 539; Rejoinder, para. 351.\n\n(f) Whether the benefits of the Claimed Investments have been appropriated by Poland or transferred to other entities\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Servier\u2019s Arguments*\n---------------------\n\n266.\n\nAccording to Servier, it is irrelevant whether Poland intended to effect an expropriation or whether the State itself benefited from the taking to a finding of indirect expropriation. Having said that, Servier asserts that \"Polish authorities have \u2018taken away\u2019 Servier\u2019s investments and given them to Servier\u2019s Polish competitors.\"473\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 211.\n\n267.\n\nServier states that Poland viewed the harmonisation process as a means to promote the local pharmaceutical industry, in particular through the registration of low-cost local generic products.474 Indeed, Servier argues, Poland\u2019s measures have benefited local Polish companies, by transferring clientele for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup to Servier\u2019s Polish competitors. In the absence of Detralex, doctors and patients have turned to Diosminex and Pelethrocin. Moreover, because Servier has not been permitted to advertise Eurespal Syrup, most doctors and patients are no longer aware of its availability and Polish generics have succeeded in positioning themselves as direct substitutes.475 Servier submits that sales of Diosminex, Pelethrocin, and Eurespal Syrup generics have increased since 2009, at a time when Servier could no longer market Detralex and Eurespal Syrup in Poland. Once sales of Servier\u2019s drugs on the market are exhausted, its market share will be definitively taken over by drugs of Polish competitors.476\n\nReply, para. 271.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 6.\n\nReply, para. 271.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n268.\n\nIn response to Servier\u2019s argument that Poland has \"taken away\" Servier\u2019s investments and given them to Servier\u2019s Polish competitors, Poland contends that [REDACTED] Nor has Poland itself received any benefit or been enriched in any way by the non-renewal of the marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup.477\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 540-541.\n\n269.\n\nPoland further argues that, contrary to what Servier submits, the extent to which the benefits of a claimant\u2019s investment has been appropriated by a host State or preferred third parties is a factor in expropriation jurisprudence.478 Furthermore, in Poland\u2019s view, the mere fact that there has been a shift in the market shares for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup to their competitors since 2009 does not, by itself, establish that the benefits associated with the Claimed Investments have been appropriated by a third party; any gain in market share does not establish appropriation of the benefits of Servier\u2019s alleged [REDACTED].479\n\nRejoinder, para. 349.\n\nRejoinder, para. 350.\n\n(g) Whether Servier had a legitimate expectation of being able to market Detralex and Eurespal Syrup indefinitely\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*Servier\u2019s Arguments*\n---------------------\n\n270.\n\nServier submits that the Polish authorities did not and do not have the power to grant or refuse an application on the basis of reasons other than those specified in the Polish Pharmaceutical Law. Thus, Servier had the legitimate expectation that Polish authorities would only apply the requirements of the Pharmaceutical Law. Servier claims that Poland applied \"unwritten requirements to the Detralex and Eurespal Syrup applications\", and thus defeated Servier\u2019s legitimate expectations.480\n\nReply, para. 277.\n\n271.\n\nPoland argues that the fact that Servier\u2019s initial investment costs were modest and would have been recouped by now through sales revenue shows that Servier did not rely on an expectation that it would be able to market its products in Poland indefinitely when it first invested. In response, Servier argues that the expectation on the part of an investor to earn a return and recoup the initial contribution after a certain time is legitimate in the context of investment arbitration.481\n\nReply, paras. 278-279.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n272.\n\nPoland argues that Servier could not have reasonably expected that, by acquiring [REDACTED] it would enjoy an indefinite authorisation to market its products in Poland.482\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 544.\n\n273.\n\nPoland describes Servier\u2019s alleged legitimate expectation that Polish authorities would apply the requirements of the Pharmaceutical Law and not \"unwritten requirements to the Detralex and Eurespal Syrup applications\" as inapposite.483 Even accepting Servier\u2019s argument that the Pharmaceutical Law in itself could serve as a source of its legitimate expectations for the purposes of its indirect expropriation claim. Poland submits that they have not been defeated by Poland\u2019s actions. Poland did not apply \"unwritten requirements\", but complied with applicable domestic laws.484\n\nRejoinder, para. 344.\n\nRejoinder, para. 345.\n\n274.\n\nPoland points to five factors that it says should have shaped Servier\u2019s expectations: (1) the acquisition of [REDACTED] does not carry with it any permission to sell tangible products; (2) its prior marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup were finite; (3) the pharmaceutical industry is a highly regulated industry in which regulations continuously evolve in line with scientific advancements and changing levels of risk tolerance; (4) by the time Servier began operations in the Polish market in 1992, it was evident that the Polish regulatory regime for pharmaceuticals would eventually have to comply with EU standards; and (5) Servier received no specific assurances from the Polish government that it would be permitted to market Detralex and Eurespal Syrup indefinitely regardless of compliance with regulatory standards.485\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 544; *see also* Rejoinder, paras. 346-347.\n\n275.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**2.

Poland submits that none of these additional conditions are supported by any authority, and that, in any event, Servier\u2019s condition of \"reasonableness\" is essentially the same as the condition of \"proportionality\"493 Poland submits that the examination of public purpose does not include these additional considerations; rather, the test is simply whether the public purpose is valid, and whether there was a rational, or plausible, link between the measures and the public purpose.494\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 490.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 269-271.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 39.\n\n279.\n\nAs to the standard of review to be applied by the Tribunal, Poland emphasizes that, in assessing the measures, it \"should not embark upon an open-ended enquiry into the scientific correctness of the decisions in question or substitute its own regulatory choices for those made by the competent Polish regulator.\"495 Rather, the Tribunal should assess whether the measures were \"motivated by honest belief, held in good faith and based on reasonable scientific grounds,\" that is, whether Poland acted as a reasonable regulator.496\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 38.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 38 (quoting *Methanex Corp.* v. *United States of America,* NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Final Award dated 3 Aug. 2005, para. 102).\n\n***(2) Burden of proof***\n-------------------------\n\n*Servier\u2019s Arguments*\n---------------------\n\n280.\n\nServier argues that Poland has the burden of showing that any justification for the adoption of the disputed Measures complies with the police powers standard.

The Polish authorities found these drugs to be generic equivalents of Detralex. These medicines were registered as generics of Detralex despite the inability on the part of their manufacturers to demonstrate that their products contained the same active ingredient as, and were bioequivalent to, Detralex.586\n\nAccording to Servier, Pelethrocin was registered in Poland in June 2002 by the Greek company HEL.P as an alleged generic of Detralex. Pelethrocin is represented and marketed in Poland by the Polish company Blubit.

It observes that at first LEK-AM and Blubit attempted to register their products as direct generics of Detralex. However, once the Polish authorities in mid-2008 decided not to extend the marketing authorisation for Detralex (which had been listed as the reference product for the generics590), LEK-AM and Blubit were allowed by the Ministry to change to the well-established use procedure.591 They were permitted to do so, Servier claims, despite the Diosmin Advisory Team acknowledging that Pelethrocin\u2019s specifications did not comply with those of Detralex or the Phar. Eur., and despite the absence of any evidence that Diosminex contained MPFF as its active substance or was bioequivalent to Detralex.592 Moreover, on the basis of the statement of the Diosmin Advisory Team in February 2008 that the \"decision [to classify Diosminex in the well-established use category] was issued already some time ago,\" Servier asserts that this decision was taken by the Polish authorities \"somewhere in the shadow,\" and given to the Diosmin Team as predetermined.593 By virtue of relying on the well-established use procedure, Polish authorities granted marketing authorisations to Diosminex and Pelethrocin while refusing to extend the marketing authorisation for Detralex on the basis of the very same data and publications generated by the clinical trials for Detralex.594\n\nReply, para. 337.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 237.\n\nReply, para. 342; Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 69.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 69-72.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 237; Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 72.\n\n316.\n\nServier disputes Poland\u2019s assertion that the registration of Diosminex did not take place in the context of the harmonisation process. According to the CJEU, these authorisations were made in that context and in order to allow local products illegally to abuse the harmonisation process.595 Servier also asserts that the record shows that Poland processed Diosminex\u2019s initial marketing authorisation application contemporaneously with that of Detralex.596\n\nReply, paras. 70-74, 335; Claimants refer to Exhibit C-130, *European Commission v. Poland,* European Court of Justice Judgment dated 22 Dec. 2010, Case C-385/08.\n\nReply, para. 336.\n\n317.\n\nAccording to Servier, the procedure that Poland followed in deciding the marketing authorisation was also discriminatory: Servier filed its application for harmonisation in early 2004, no action was taken on it for two years, and it was not decided until five years had elapsed. By contrast, (1) LEK-AM filed its application for Diosminex in late 2007, and it was approved within a year; and (2) consideration of Pelethrocin\u2019s application was similarly rapid.597 Servier submits further that the authorities granted LEK-AM the right to supplement its registration dossier even after the renewal was granted, but no such courtesy was granted to Servier.598\n\nReply, para. 341; *see also* Supplement, paras. 8-11.\n\nReply, para. 343.\n\n318.\n\nServier further claims that the Ministry also discriminated against it in comparison to other producers of innovative drugs. Servier\u2019s declaration that Detralex was already registered on the basis of the same documentation in other EU countries was not accepted by the Ministry as sufficient to extend its marketing authorisation, contrary to the cases of other innovative manufacturers in the same situation.599\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 238.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n319.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n320.\n\nPoland denies that the *initial* registrations of Diosminex and Pelethrocin demonstrate the discriminatory treatment of Detralex\u2019s subsequent renewal application. Poland contends that those decisions pre-date the decision on Servier\u2019s application by four and a half years in the case of Diosminex, and six and a half years in the case of Pelethrocin. Further, they were made under different legislation\u2014-the 1991 Pharmaceutical Act\u2014and at a point in time when the sale of Detralex was authorised in the Polish market.601\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 504; *see also* Rejoinder, para. 291; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 80.\n\n321.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n322.\n\nPoland states that there was no substantive discrimination during the harmonisation process.

Poland points out that the team made similar statements as to what was required for Detralex to have its marketing authorisation renewed.608 Also, Poland clarified that HELP was never \"required to change to the well-established use procedure, but rather was requested to use it at its discretion.609\n\nRejoinder, para. 297; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 80.\n\nRejoinder, para. 298.\n\n327.\n\n[REDACTED].

Servier submits that this is what the Ministry did earlier with respect to locally owned competitor products, Diosminex and Pelethrocin.621 Servier submits that Poland allowed LEK-AM to supplement the dossier for Diosminex even after the harmonisation was granted, and granted Pelethrocin harmonisation despite a lack of information on its manufacturing method and composition, among other things. Blubit was also allowed to supplement its dossier following harmonisation.622\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 226; Reply, para. 327.\n\nReply, para. 327 (referring to Exhibit C-214, Protocols of the National Medicines Institute on Pelethrocin dated 25 Nov. 2008, p. 3).

The decision not to renew was disproportionate to the issues identified in the 19 December 2008 decision, which principally addressed [REDACTED] Servier submits that those concerns were laid to rest in subsequent correspondence between Servier and Poland and that there was no public health reason why the product\u2019s marketing authorisation could not have been renewed while questions concerning [REDACTED] could have been resolved.623\n\nReply, paras. 325-326.\n\n334.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*Poland's Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n335.\n\nAs a threshold point, Poland does not accept the proposition implicit in Servier\u2019s contentions, that a host State must choose regulatory measures which are the most conducive to the interest of the foreign investor.

Absent a request from the applicant, as a matter of Polish administrative law it was not open to the Registration Office to consider such an option.626 Further, the Pharmaceutical Law, which implements the EU Pharmaceuticals Directive, does not permit the issuance of marketing authorisations with recommendations.627\n\nRejoinder, para. 305; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 106.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 511. Further, Poland argues, such an authorisation would result in non-compliant products being authorised on the Polish market, which does not achieve public health goals, and is not evidence of a lack of proportionality. *Id.* para. 512.\n\n337.\n\nPoland contests Servier\u2019s submission that the refusal to renew was disproportionate to the issues identified [REDACTED] especially when those issues were resolved in June 2009.

Servier claims that it was clear for both Servier and the authorities that in such a situation, it had no legal recourse to challenge the decision.634\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 243.\n\n343.\n\nServier denies that it was its fault that the Polish authorities required five years to decide the harmonisation process for Detralex.635 Servier submits that Poland has not explained how it processed the successful applications for Diosminex and Pelethrocin within 12 months while requiring 28 months to assess and deny that of Detralex. Servier insists that there is no excuse for the fact that Poland\u2019s decision was released after it was legally impossible to challenge the decision.636\n\nReply, para. 350.\n\nReply, paras. 351, 354.\n\n344.\n\nServier further submits that Poland failed to demonstrate that it reviewed the Detralex application prior to 2006, although that application was filed in January 2004. Servier, unlike Poland, does not view the testimony of [REDACTED] as supporting that the decision of June 2005 showed that Poland had started reviewing the merits of Servier\u2019s application.637 Servier argues, in this regard that any delays on its part in responding to demands from Poland during the application process are not comparable to the delays caused by Poland.638 Besides, most of the delays attributed to Servier by Poland actually resulted from Poland\u2019s conduct.639\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Submission, para. 59.\n\nReply, para. 352.\n\nReply, para. 353.\n\n345.\n\nServier denies that Poland\u2019s measures occurred because of delays in the preparation of documents and information by Servier.

Poland also notes that Servier did appeal the decision of the Registration Office before the Polish courts.643 Poland further submits that Servier\u2019s argument that Poland\u2019s decisions were taken because of a \"political storm that erupted in November 2007\" is incompatible with the fact that the Registration Office raised the fundamental problems with Servier\u2019s application before November 2007.644 Poland also asserts that Servier\u2019s interpretation of the minutes of the Diosmin Advisory Team is not supported by any evidence. To the contrary, Mr. Cessak and Professor Mazurek did not suggest that the Detralex Decision was \"a foregone conclusion\", neither did Dr. Wiqckowska suggest that she was engaged in a conspiracy.645\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 515, 517.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 517; Rejoinder, para. 309.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41 (quoting Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 30).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 42.\n\n347.\n\nPoland argues that there is no compelling evidence showing that Poland deliberately delayed the process.646 The factual record rather shows that it was Servier\u2019s repeated requests for extensions of deadlines and refusal to submit supplemental information in a timely manner that delayed the process (the delays caused by Servier in the processing of the Detralex harmonisation application cumulatively account for a period of 32 months).647 For example, following the specific request of the Registration Office, Servier took four months to provide [REDACTED] Although Servier has argued that it could not respond to Poland\u2019s 17 requests of 16 April 2007 within the 30-day time limit, it has not explained why it required four months to do so. Similarly, Servier has failed to explain its delay of 16 months in responding to Poland\u2019s request for [REDACTED] made in March 2007. This delay is all the more confounding in the face of clear documentary evidence that [REDACTED].\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 44.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 516.

The Parties agree that the declared composition, dosage, and form for Eurespal Syrup and for the three Polish drugs are identical. When Servier applied for authorisation to continue to sell Eurespal Syrup in Poland, it was denied on the basis of the alleged [REDACTED] This shows discrimination against Servier, because Polish authorities arrived at different conclusions with respect to one and the same product registered on the basis of the same documentation.713\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 235-236; Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 78.\n\n381.\n\nServier rejects Poland\u2019s justifications that a different legal regime applied to the locally-owned products because they purported to be generics of Pneumorel. It notes Poland\u2019s concession that the denial of the Eurespal application in light of the approval of the three Polish drugs identical to it is \"strange,\" and denies that Poland\u2019s actions were mandated under EU law. Rather, the situation was created by the Polish authorities \"by design, as it was they who instructed the Polish producers to use the French name for Eurespal Syrup.\"714 Servier submits in this respect that if Poland had serious concerns about [REDACTED] of Eurespal Syrup, those concerns should have prevented it from actively facilitating the registration of the generics.715\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 85-86; Claimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Submission, para. 61.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Submission, para. 61.\n\n382.\n\nServier rejects as misleading the statement by Poland\u2019s witness, Mr. Cessak, made at the hearing, to the effect that, although Poland had discretionary power to remove Eurespal from the market, it was bound by the decision of the French regulator with respect to the Polish generics.716 Servier\u2019s view rests on five separate reasons.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 87.\n\n383.\n\nFirst, Mr. Cessak\u2019s statement is hearsay. Mr. Cessak was not responsible for evaluating applications to register generic products at the time the decisions were taken on Pulneo and Elofen, but instead relied on a letter from the French regulator not produced in this arbitration.717\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 88.\n\n384.\n\nSecond, according to Mr. Cessak, the French regulator confirmed to Poland that the Eurespal Syrup documentation was \"compliant with the acquis.\" In Servier\u2019s view, this confirmation should have been sufficient to harmonise Eurespal Syrup, and Poland could have brought any remaining concerns with regard to [REDACTED] to the EU authorities through the Community Referral Procedure.718\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 89.\n\n385.\n\nThird, Servier rejects Poland\u2019s argument that it could neither verify the French regulator\u2019s position nor request documentation from the French regulator; instead, under Article 15(2) of the Polish Pharmaceutical Law, Poland could request any relevant, necessary documentation.719\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 90 (quoting Tr. 471:17-20) (Testimony of Mr. Cessak).\n\n386.\n\nFourth, Servier denies Poland\u2019s suggestion that Pneumorel remained on the French market because the French regulator possessed different documents from those in the possession of the Polish authorities. Servier submits that the full French registration dossier, produced during this arbitration, contains exactly the same clinical trials as does the Polish dossier, and that these trials were sufficient for the French regulator to conclude that the Eurespal Syrup registration complied with the *acquis.720*\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 91-92.\n\n387.\n\nFifth, if Poland\u2019s concerns regarding [REDACTED] were genuine, rather than considering itself bound by the French regulator, under Article 33 of the Polish Pharmaceutical Law and Article 116 of the EU Directive, it was required to revoke the marketing authorisations for the generics. The serious public health concerns [REDACTED] apply without exception to all applicants and all product [REDACTED] EU laws is to the same effect.721 [REDACTED] Consequently, Poland\u2019s decision to refuse harmonisation of Eurespal Syrup had nothing to do with the legal grounds stated in its decision.724\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 93-94; Reply, paras. 346-347; Claimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Submission, para. 62.\n\nReply, para. 347.\n\n388.\n\nServier also states that Poland\u2019s argument is impossible to credit given that it assisted the Polish generic manufacturers in selecting the procedure that it was \"forced\" to follow.725\n\nReply, para. 349.\n\n389.\n\nServier also claims that the Ministry of Health discriminated against it in comparison to other producers of innovative drugs. Servier\u2019s declaration that Eurespal Syrup was already registered on the basis of the same documentation in other EU countries was\u2014contrary to the cases of other innovative manufacturers in the same situation\u2014not accepted by the Ministry of Health as sufficient to extend its marketing authorisation.726\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 238.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n390.\n\nPoland submits that the requirements that were imposed on Servier were applied across the board: all applicants, whether domestic or foreign, applying for approval as original medical products were treated equally [REDACTED] Similarly, all applicants applying for approval as generics were treated the same.727\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 527; Respondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 57.\n\n391.\n\nPoland rejects Servier\u2019s allegation that its decision to authorise Pulneo, Elofen, and Fenspogal Syrups while denying an authorisation for Eurespal Syrup was discriminatory. The divergent outcomes, Poland states, were due to the fact that there was a crucial difference between Servier\u2019s application and the applications for the three other syrups: Servier sought to renew its marketing authorisation as an *original* medicinal product whereas the three syrups applied to be registered as *generic* products. Poland insists that the difference in regulatory categories carries significant implications for the role of the Polish authorities.728\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 527; Rejoinder, para. 332; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 81; Respondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 54.\n\n392.\n\nUnder the Pharmaceutical Law, applicants for generic registrations are not required to provide the results of clinical (or preclinical) trials since these have been conducted by the marketing authorisation holder of the reference product. Where the reference product is a European reference product *(i.e.,* not registered in Poland), the Registration Office is required to make certain enquiries of its counterpart regulator, but no clinical assessment is conducted. By contrast, when examining an original application (under Article 10), the authority must conduct a full evaluation of the dossier, which involves an assessment of the validity of the clinical documentation. For this reason, which is derived from EU law, Poland was not presented with clinical data on the three generic syrups, and was neither required nor competent to \"look behind\" the French registration of Pneumorel Syrup to assess whether clinical data presented in France warranted approval of Pneumorel Syrup for use in the paediatric population. Indeed, the Registration Office was required to follow the findings on safety and efficacy made by the French authorities.729\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 528-529; Rejoinder, para. 332; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 82.\n\n393.\n\nPoland submits that the divergent outcomes are therefore a product of the fact of different legal requirements, and not of any differentiation between Polish and French applicants.730 Moreover, Poland submits that the validity of Poland\u2019s regulatory decisions must be assessed in light of the material available to the regulator at the time of its decision and that Poland only received a copy of the French registration dossier in the course of this arbitration and thus was not in its possession when the decision was made.731\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 83.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 56.\n\n394.\n\nPoland claims that the EU Pharmaceuticals Directive sets forth sound reasons for such a differentiation, *i.e.,* averting the need for duplicative and costly clinical trials on live participants.732 It also seeks to ensure cooperation and the prevention of duplicative efforts between EU regulators.733\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 530 (citing Exhibit C-82, EU Pharmaceuticals Directive, recital 10).\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 530.\n\n395.\n\nPoland rejects Servier's argument that [REDACTED].\n\n396.\n\nSecond, although it may seem inconsistent to approve the generics and simultaneously refuse Eurespal Syrup, Poland maintains that the legislation and corresponding EU law compelled such a result.735 Poland says that the nature of the EU regulatory regime permits regulatory decisions in one Member State to have effects in other Member States.

In Servier\u2019s view, this argument cannot be credited because Poland \"itself advised the generic companies to take that route.\"740\n\nReply, para. 329.\n\nReply, para. 329.\n\n399.\n\nSecond, EU law law recognises that [REDACTED] Servier claims that EU law does not require that such products be \"removed from the market pending further study and assessment.\"742 At the hearing, Dr. Wieckowska confirmed that the EMA does not recommend removing products from the market only because [REDACTED]. The decision not to renew the marketing authorisation for Eurespal Syrup was therefore unreasonable.744\n\nReply, para. 330.\n\nReply, para. 331; Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 96.\n\n400.\n\nThird, the decision to remove Eurespal Syrup was disproportionate when one considers that the arguments advanced by Poland only concern [REDACTED]. The decision not to renew the marketing authorisation rather than limit its indications was disproportionate.747\n\nReply, para. 332.\n\n401.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n402.\n\nFinally, Servier submits that the testimony of Poland\u2019s own witness, Dr. Wieckowska, did not support its \"drastic and disproportionate\" measure.749 Dr. Wieckowska stated that she did not, in fact, recommended [REDACTED] out only found that [REDACTED] At that point, Poland should have consulted the Paediatric Committee in order to determine what steps to take in respect of Eurespal Syrup. Poland did not consult the Paediatric Committee, but instead removed Eurespal Syrup from the market.750\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 98.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, para. 98.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n403.\n\nPoland contends that Servier has failed to show that its refusal to renew the authorisation for Eurespal Syrup was \"obviously disproportionate\".751\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 533; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 106.\n\n404.\n\nAccording to Poland, absent a request from the applicant, as a matter of Polish administrative law it was not open to the relevant authorities unilaterally to restrict the proposed indications of an application. Servier, for its part, never made such a request.752 Poland submits that the Pharmaceutical Law makes it clear that issuing a marketing authorisation \"shall mean the approval of the Summary of Product Characteristics\"; thus there is no scope for a \"partial\" or \"restricted\" approval, as suggested by Servier.753\n\nRejoinder, para. 339; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 106.

Accordingly, Servier argues that the Polish authorities\u2019 decision, though made under the guise of harmonisation, had nothing to do with harmonising the documentation for Eurespal Syrup with that assessed elsewhere in the EU.756\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 240.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 241.\n\n407.\n\nThe decision of the Minister of Health refusing to renew the marketing authorisation for Eurespal Syrup was delivered to Servier on 5 December 2008, *i.e.,* just 3 weeks before its marketing authorisation was to expire. The decision indicated (for the first time) that [REDACTED] Servier submits that it was left with virtually no legal recourse to challenge or otherwise address this decision.757.

It provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party undertakes to ensure, in its territory and maritime areas, fair and equitable treatment of the investments of investors of the other Party, any unjustified or discriminatory measures which might impede their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or liquidation being prohibited.\n\n415.\n\nIt is Poland\u2019s opinion that this clause of the Treaty is narrowly drafted such that \"any unjustified or discriminatory measures... being prohibited\" is not a separate and independent standard but is rather an explanation of the standard set out earlier in the provision. Poland rejects Servier\u2019s claims that this clause encompasses the \"concrete principles\" that Servier considers as relevant to this dispute.776\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 555 (quoting Statement of Claim, para. 273).\n\n416.\n\nAccording to Poland, the standard for a breach of the fair and equitable treatment is high; it does not seek to tie the hands of a State regulator nor to substitute a tribunal\u2019s view of the appropriate course of action for that of an administrative body.777 The fair and equitable treatment standard does not provide a general right to good governance or compensation where a State falls short of such standard.778\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 556-562.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 563.\n\n417.\n\nPoland states that its non-renewal of the marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup was a good faith regulatory action for the legitimate public purpose of protecting public health.779 Poland\u2019s actions were non-discriminatory and applied in an even-handed manner: [REDACTED]. Poland says that its actions with regard to Detralex and Eurespal Syrup were rationally order to ensure compliance with [REDACTED].782 Poland denies that Servier could have had a legitimate expectation that its marketing authorisations would continue indefinitely given that they were granted for limited periods of time and subject to renewal.783 Finally, Poland argues that it gave Servier numerous notices of the shortcomings of its applications and multiple opportunities to rectify said shortcomings.784\n\n*See generally* Rejoinder, paras. 365-366.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 568.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 568.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 570.\n\n***(2) National treatment***\n----------------------------\n\n*Servier\u2019s Arguments*\n---------------------\n\n418.\n\nServier submits that Poland accorded more favourable treatment to the Polish producers of Diosminex, Elofen Syrup, Pulneo Syrup, and Fenspogal Syrup than it did to Servier.785\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 290; Reply, paras. 380-381.\n\n419.\n\nSpecifically, Servier argues that the Polish local producers of fenspiride-based syrup had no difficulty and were actively assisted by Poland in obtaining marketing authorisations based on the reference drug Pneumorel\u2014the brand name of Eurespal Syrup in France\u2014whereas Poland denied Eurespal Syrup a marketing authorisation.

According to Servier\u2019s economic damages expert Mr. [REDACTED] where as here, a \"business opportunity\"\u2014 developed by Poland through the \"invest[ment of] substantial sums of money\" and the [REDACTED] is extinguished at the same time as the assets... the entire business will be the object of valuation.\"811 Thus, the *\"actual,* as opposed to book, value of Servier\u2019s investment in Poland\"812 must encompass [REDACTED].\n\nReply, para. 399.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Post-Hearing Submission, para. 79.\n\nReply, para. 400.\n\nReply, para. 401 (quoting Second Deloitte/FTI Report, paras 3.4, 3.6).\n\nReply, para. 402.\n\n429.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n430.\n\nDrawing on international arbitration jurisprudence, Servier asserts an alternative argument: any *lex specialis* established by Article 5(2) that is inferior to \"full reparation\" would apply only to *lawful* measures of expropriation, and not to *unlawful* expropriation, such as the one Servier has suffered.816 The Respondent\u2019s measures do not satisfy the criteria of public necessity, lack of discrimination, and prompt and adequate compensation, required under the Treaty for a taking to be lawful. All the more because their damages result from unlawful measures, the purpose of the valuation here is \"not to determine a price that a hypothetical buyer would be willing to pay for [REDACTED] but to restore Servier to the financial position that it would have been in, if Poland had not adopted its unlawful measures.\"817\n\nReply, paras. 394-395.\n\nReply, para. 404; Claimants\u2019 First Post-Hearing Submission, paras. 131-132.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n431.\n\nWithout prejudice to its positions that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction and that there was no breach of the Treaty, the Respondent submits that Servier\u2019s damages submissions are flawed because they fail to value the Claimed Investments.\n\n432.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimants as to the meaning and implications of Article 5(2) of the Treaty. According to the Respondent, the effect of Article 5(2), which limits compensation to the \"actual value of the investments in question,\" is to create a *lex specialis* for damages under the Treaty, which displaces general principles of damages under customary international law.818 The purpose of Article 5(2) of the Treaty, therefore, is not to \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act,\" as the Claimants suggest, but, rather, to \"compensate the investor for the loss of the actual value of the protected investments of which it claims to have been dispossessed.\"819 Poland places emphasis on the words, \"investments in question.\" In its view, these words \"put it beyond any doubt that compensation is strictly limited to the value of the investments of which an expropriation has been demonstrated. It is therefore crucial to identify with precision the relevant investments.\"820\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 582.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 582 (quoting Statement of Claim, para. 301).\n\nRejoinder, para. 374.\n\n433.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the investments protected by the Treaty are [REDACTED] The Tribunal\u2019s task is to assess the value of these specific rights on 31 December 2008, if it finds that they were expropriated.822 The Tribunal may not value or compensate the Claimants for any and all losses alleged to be causally linked to the supposed Treaty breach.823\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 583.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 584.\n\n434.\n\nIn its damages submissions, Servier and its expert have made no attempt to identify or to value [REDACTED] Poland first, to Servier\u2019s failure to respond to its request for documents establishing the value of the Claimed Investments for the purposes of audited financial statements or other accounting purposes. In therefore [REDACTED] Poland refers, second, to instruct its expert Mr. [REDACTED] Neither of Mr. [REDACTED] reports defines the investments, or even acknowledges them to be [REDACTED] a flaw that \"goes to the very heart\" of and \"vitiates\" the Claimants\u2019 valuation.826 Third, Mr. [REDACTED] adopted the DCF methodology to assess Servier's loss of [REDACTED]/\n\nStatement of Defence, paras. 587-588; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 115; *see also* Rejoinder, para. 382, The Respondent points out that, at the hearing, [REDACTED] Moreover, the DCF viewed by Mr. [REDACTED] was generated by much more than the Claimed Investments.

The Respondent holds that there is no consensus on the standard of compensation for expropriation in international law; moreover, there is no need to look beyond the Treaty text.840\n\nRejoinder, paras. 389-390.\n\n440.\n\nPoland further denies that a standard of full indemnity is required because any expropriation was \"unlawful.\" It finds such a suggestion inconsistent with Servier\u2019s admission that Article 5(2) provides the standard of compensation.841 Moreover, Servier has not demonstrated that the non-renewal decisions were not taken for reasons of public necessity and were discriminatory.842 Moreover, according to Poland, the application of general international law principles would require the Claimants to establish causation, including remoteness and foreseeability.

Servier contends that the appropriate rate is the one applicable in Poland to legal claims\u2014a simple annual rate of 13 percent\u2014as set forth in the Polish Civil Code by the Government\u2019s regulation of 4 December 2008, which was in force at the time of the measures at issue and remains in force today.941 In Mr. [REDACTED] preliminary calculation, simple interest at 13 percent from the effective date of the dispossession measures to the end of April 2011 amounts to [REDACTED] Servier denies that the Polish statutory interest rate was set at a \"punitive level\" or that it originates in an obscure provision of Polish law.

Poland agrees that the award of interest and the applicable interest rate is for the Tribunal to determine in its discretion, based on the circumstances of the case.945 However, the Respondent notes that Servier \"cherry-pick[s] from Polish law\"946 a \"punitive\" interest rate of 13 percent, applicable under the Polish Civil Code in the context of payment of commercial invoices,947 which results in [REDACTED]948\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 634.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 630.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 629.

Servier submits that taking into account the circumstances of this case, the Respondent should bear these costs.960 Poland acted in an \"abusive and opaque manner, applying double standards and waiting until the end of the harmonisation process to notify its decisions not to renew the marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup.\"961\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Costs, paras. 13-14.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Costs, para. 15.\n\n487.\n\nMoreover, Servier contends that the Tribunal should consider the degree of success achieved by the Parties in the arbitration, as well as the Parties\u2019 respective conduct that may have needlessly increased costs.962 In respect to the latter, Poland\u2019s conduct has unnecessarily increased the costs of these proceedings by its: (1) request for bifurcation of the proceedings; (2) r\u00e9introduction of a request for bifurcation on issues which had already been subject to the Tribunal\u2019s prior decision on bifurcation; (3) excessive document production requests which led to the production of over 86,000 pages of which the Respondent exhibited very few; (4) unfounded reliance on legal privilege in respect of statements made by Ms. Retkowska-Mika; (5) unfounded redactions of documents concerning the Diosminex and Pelethrocin files; (6) belated production of documents on 12 April 2011 that forced Servier to prepare a Supplement to its Reply Memorial; (7) petition for an Order preventing the Claimants from relying on Article 24 of the EU Pharmaceutical Directive, which was not pursued after the hearing; and (8) request to exhibit \"the so-called| [REDACTED] documents.\"963\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Costs, paras. 16-17.\n\nClaimants\u2019First Submission on Costs, paras. 18-19.\n\n488.\n\nConversely, Servier finds no merit in Poland\u2019s contention that Servier increased the costs of arbitration by making \"manifestly unfounded and irrelevant assertions,\" particularly relating to Procoralan and to the initial registrations of Pelethrocin and Diosminex.964 Servier\u2019s position was \"amply substantiated and confirmed by documentary evidence and witness statements.\"965 Further, Servier argues that the Respondent\u2019s conduct concerning Procoralan is \"a relevant part of the factual background\" to the claims asserted in this arbitration.966 Similarly, the illegality of the Pelethrocin and Diosminex initial registrations, and the pertaining decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union are \"directly relevant to the assessment of Poland\u2019s treatment of Detralex.\"967 Servier equally denies having misrepresented facts in a manner that allegedly compelled the Respondent to spend time and money on corrections.968\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, para. 8 (quoting Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, para. 7).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, para 8.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, para. 9.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, paras. 10-11.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, paras. 14-15.\n\n489.\n\nRegarding Poland\u2019s assertion that Servier increased the costs of arbitration by making claims beyond direct expropriation based on the MFN and Applicable Law clauses in the Treaty, Servier asserts that it is Poland that insisted on briefing the MFN clause as a preliminary matter, thus increasing the costs of the arbitration. Moreover, Servier denies having abandoned its applicable law argument at the hearing, stressing that the hearing's purpose was to review the state of the evidentiary record and to highlight points to be addressed by witness testimony, rather than to present a comprehensive oral argument.969\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, paras. 12-13.\n\n490.\n\nServier submits that the Respondent has provided no proof of its claim that EU avenues of redress would have been less costly than these proceedings.970 In addition, the Respondent has failed to explain why it evaluates the additional costs allegedly caused by Servier\u2019s conduct at 30 percent of its legal costs.971\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, para. 16.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, para. 18.\n\n491.\n\nServier\u2019s legal costs incurred include Salans legal fees and disbursements in the amount of [REDACTED] Deloitte fees and disbursements in the amount of [REDACTED] FTI fees and disbursements in the amount of $ [REDACTED] and costs for accommodation and other expenses in relation to the hearing on the merits in the amount to [REDACTED]972. Servier claims that these legal costs are reasonable and proportionate and that they therefore should be compensated in full.973 In this respect, Servier submits that the attorneys\u2019 and consultant experts\u2019 fees are based on conservative hourly rates, depending on their respective level of expertise, and that assistants with lower hourly rates were used whenever possible.974\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Costs, para. 21.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Costs, para. 20.\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Costs, para. 22.\n\n492.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, by contrast, the Respondent has failed to establish that its legal costs are reasonable and proportionate.975 In fact, the fees and expenses of the Respondent\u2019s counsel exceed those of Servier\u2019s counsel by approximately 25 percent, while the Respondent\u2019s damage experts\u2019 fees and expenses are twice as high as those of Servier\u2019s experts.976 Servier expresses surprise at the level of Poland\u2019s legal costs, given Poland\u2019s strategy in this arbitration, which consisted of attempting to cast doubt on the Claimants\u2019 case, rather than developing a positive case of its own.977\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, para. 1.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, paras. 4-5.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Second Submission on Costs, para. 3.\n\n493.\n\nThe Claimants further explain that the following factors were considered in its evaluation of overall legal costs: (1) the importance of the matter to Servier; (2) the extent and amount of damages suffered by Servier; (3) the international nature of the dispute, requiring legal representation across several jurisdictions and travel, translation and investigation arrangements; (3) Poland\u2019s conduct in this arbitration; and (4) the complexity of the factual and legal issues.978\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Costs, para. 23.\n\n494.\n\nUltimately, Servier notes that the above-mentioned legal costs have been paid or are in the process of being paid.979\n\nClaimants\u2019 First Submission on Costs, para. 24.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n495.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to order Servier to pay the entire costs of arbitration, in the amount of \u20ac 4,226,755.59 plus interest, consisting of its own costs; the costs of the arbitrators and the Registry; the legal costs and other expenses incurred by the Respondent, including the fees and expenses of its legal counsel, experts and consultants, the travel costs and other expenses of its representatives as well as the costs for translation, on a full indemnity basis; and interest thereon at such commercial rate as the Tribunal thinks fit and on a compound basis.980\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, para. 16 and Schedule 1; *see also* Rejoinder, para. 439.\n\n496.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Articles 38 and 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules grant the Tribunal \"broad discretion and substantial flexibility\" with respect to the allocation of costs, and requests that the Tribunal exercise its discretion in the Respondent\u2019s favour.981 In particular, Poland, asserting that the Parties agree on the relevance of the \"costs-follow-the-event\" principle, requests that the Tribunal order the Claimants to pay all costs associated with these proceedings, should the Tribunal reject Servier\u2019s claims under the Treaty.982\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, para. 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, para. 6; Respondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs, para. 2.\n\n497.\n\nIn the alternative, irrespective of the outcome of the dispute, Poland submits that the Tribunal should render an award on costs in Poland\u2019s favour. In Poland\u2019s view, Servier was not willing to narrow the issues in dispute, but insisted on maintaining unfounded and irrelevant assertions, in particular in relation to the drug Procoralan, claims beyond indirect expropriation, and the registrations of Pelethrocin and Diosminex. Moreover, according to Poland, Servier made several unfounded procedural applications, including an application to introduce new evidence into the record which was subsequently withdrawn, and an application to exclude from the record evidence and information generated in the expert re-evaluation process. In addition, Servier mischaracterized certain evidence in its Reply Memorial, which forced the Respondent to spend time and costs in correcting those misrepresentations. Poland submits further that Servier\u2019s damages assessment is significantly inflated, while the costs of this arbitration could have been avoided if [REDACTED].\n\n498.\n\nPoland alleges that Servier\u2019s conduct has directly caused the Respondent to incur additional and unnecessary costs, which account for approximately 30 percent of its overall costs of legal representation. Thus, it requests the Tribunal to order that the Claimants bear their own costs and at least 30 percent of the Respondent\u2019s legal costs, should the Claimants prevail on the merits.984\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, para. 8.\n\n499.\n\nConversely, the Respondent denies having adopted an improper conduct that warrants an adverse award on legal costs, and addresses in turn each of Servier\u2019s arguments.985 First, Poland submits that the allegations that it \"committed multiple breaches of the Treaty,\" \"acted in an abusive and opaque manner,\" and \"waited until the end of the harmonization process to notify its decisions not to renew the marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup\" were demonstrated to be \"factually unfounded and legally unsustainable,\" and in any event pertain to the merits of the case, rather than to an assessment of arbitral costs.986 In Poland\u2019s view, any cost inefficiencies arising from the bifurcation of the proceedings are entirely attributable to the Claimants\u2019 pursuit of its frivolous Additional Claims, its repeated changes in position, and its strenuous objection to the Respondent\u2019s request to resolve both the MFN and Applicable Law clauses\u2019 issues during the preliminary phase of the proceedings. Moreover, the Tribunal in its Decision on Bifurcation of 27 August 2010 itself acknowledged that bifurcation of the proceedings would \"serve the interests of economy and efficiency.\"987\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs, para. 4.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs, para. 5 (quoting Claimants\u2019 First Submission on Costs, para. 15).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs, paras. 6-9.\n\n500.\n\nWith respect to the Claimants\u2019 criticism of the Respondent for exhibiting only a few of the documents obtained through the document production process, the Respondent submits that this ground is not relevant to an apportionment of arbitral costs, that the Claimants submitted a substantial portion of these documents voluntarily, and that the documents that were not produced nonetheless helped complete the Respondent\u2019s understanding and analysis of the case.988 Furthermore, Poland asserts that its position on legal privilege with respect to statements made by Ms. Retkowska-Mika, while ultimately not favoured by the Tribunal, was based on a genuine and reasonable belief.989 Poland\u2019s additional production of documents on 12 April 2011 was caused by a genuine dispute between the Parties with respect to the scope of the exceptions to production set out in paragraph 1(a) of the Procedural Order of 22 February 2011.990 Poland also points out that, contrary to Servier's contention, Poland\u2019s objection to Servier\u2019s reliance on Article 24 of the EU Pharmaceutical Directive was indeed pursued in the Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief.991 Finally, the Respondent claims that the issue of the inclusion in the record of documents exhibited in Mr. [REDACTED] expert report was a product of the Claimants\u2019 \"recalcitrant approach in refusing\" the Respondent\u2019s request for inclusion.992\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs, paras. 10-11.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs, para. 12.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs, paras. 13-14.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs, para. 15.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply Submission on Costs, para. 16.\n\n501.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s legal costs comprise the fees and expenses of its experts in the amount of \u20ac 1,132,031.94; the travel costs and other expenses of its witnesses in the amount of \u20ac 8,311.12; and the costs for legal representation and assistance in the amount of \u20ac 2,746,412.53, including the fees and expenses of its legal counsel, the travel costs and other expenses of its representatives, and translation costs.993\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, paras. 9-14, 16.\n\n502.\n\nUltimately, the Respondent notes that it has advanced \u20ac 340,000.00 to the Registry for the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the Registry.994\n\nRespondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, para. 15.\n\n**6. Alternative Redress and Specific Relief**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n*Servier\u2019s Arguments*\n---------------------\n\n503.\n\nFinally, Servier submits that the Tribunal may properly order restitution under the Treaty, because specific performance is an accepted remedy in investment law and general public international law; because the Tribunal\u2019s power to order restitution is not limited by the omission of any reference to such a remedy in the Treaty; and because, in public international law, restitution is the \"first remedy,\" before compensation\u2014including in situations of unlawful expropriation.995\n\nReply, paras. 438-440.\n\n*Poland\u2019s Arguments*\n--------------------\n\n504.\n\nPoland submits that any award of damages should exclude the possibility of alternative redress, including in the form of the EU law procedures to regain marketing authorisations in Poland, in order to avoid the risk of double-recovery by Servier.996\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 635.\n\n505.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent denies that, in the circumstances of this case, specific relief may be granted in the form of an award immediately reinstating marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup in Poland. In this regard, Poland contends that specific performance is rarely awarded in investment treaty arbitration, and is explicitly excluded here by Article 5(2) of the Treaty, which limits the remedy for expropriation to compensation in the amount of the \"actual value\" of the expropriated investment.997\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 637; Rejoinder, para. 437. The Respondent additionally asserts that ordering specific performance \"would be contrary to the well-established right of the State to expropriate assets.\" Statement of Defence, para. 637.\n\n506.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal \"should not attempt to substitute its assessment of the scientific arguments\"998 for the \"science-based decisions of highly specialised regulatory agencies.\"999 Poland\u2019s decisions involved \"complex analys[e]s of many highly technical and scientific documents by the competent authorities...within the regulatory guidelines prescribed by... EU directives and Regulations.\"1000 [REDACTED]\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 639.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 638; Rejoinder, para. 437.\n\nStatement of Defence, para. 638.\n\n**VI. RELIEF REQUESTED**\n------------------------\n\n507.\n\nAt paragraph 441 of its Reply Memorial, paragraph 138 of its First Post-Hearing Submission and paragraph 16 of its First Submission on Costs, Servier requests that the Tribunal enter an award in its favour and against Poland as follows:\n\n(a) dismissing Poland\u2019s objections to jurisdiction in their entirety;\n\n(b) declaring that the Tribunal has jurisdiction in respect of this dispute and that the Claimants\u2019 claims are admissible;\n\n(c) declaring that Poland breached its obligations under Article 5(2) of the Treaty by dispossessing Servier of their investments in Detralex and Eurespal Syrup in Poland;\n\n(d) declaring that Poland breached its obligations to provide fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, to avoid taking arbitrary and discriminatory measures and to provide national treatment;\n\n(e) declaring that the value of Servier\u2019s investments in Detralex and Eurespal Syrup as of the effective date of the dispossession measures was [REDACTED].\n\n(f) ordering Poland either (i) to provide full restitution to Servier by immediately reinstating marketing authorisations for Detralex and Eurespal Syrup in Poland and compensating Servier for its losses suffered prior to the reinstatement of such authorisations or (ii) to pay compensation to Servier in the full amount of the actual value of Servier\u2019s investments in Detralex and Eurespal Syrup;\n\n(g) declaring inadmissible and excluding from the record of this arbitration documents and information generated in the re-evaluation process, in particular (i) Exhibits R-130 through R-144 inclusive, (ii) the entirety of the witness statement of [REDACTED] (iii) Section 7 (paras. 71-91) of the witness statement of Prof. Mazurek pertaining to the discussion of the expert re-evaluation process, in which he participated as a Polish-appointed expert; and (iv) those portions of Poland\u2019s Statement of Defence which expressly rely on documents mentioned in items (i) through (iii);\n\n(h) ordering Poland to pay pre-award interest at the simple annual rate of 13 percent;\n\n(i) ordering Poland to pay the entire costs of this arbitration, including all expenses that Servier has incurred or shall incur herein in respect of the fees and/or expenses of the arbitrators, the Registry, Servier\u2019s legal counsel, experts, consultants, and witnesses, totalling [REDACTED].\n\n(j) ordering Poland to pay post-award interest at a rate of 13 per annum compounded monthly on the amounts awarded until full payment thereof; and\n\n(k) ordering such other relief as the Tribunal shall deem just and proper.\n\n508.\n\nAt paragraph 439 of its Rejoinder, Poland requests the Tribunal to issue a Final Award:\n\n(a) declaring that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction in respect of this dispute or that the claims are inadmissible; or alternatively:\n\n(b) declaring Poland has not violated any of its obligations under the Treaty, or to the extent applicable, under international law or any other legal system; and,'\n\n(c) ordering the Claimants to pay all costs incurred in connection with these arbitration proceedings including their own costs, the costs of the arbitrators and the Registry, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by Poland including the fees of its legal counsel, experts and consultants, as well as Poland\u2019s own officials and employees on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at such commercial rate as the Tribunal thinks fit and on a compound basis;\n\n(d) such other relief as the Tribunal, in its discretion, considers appropriate.\n\n509.\n\nAt pages 20-21 of its Second Post-Hearing Brief and para. 16 of its Submission on Costs, Poland requests that the Tribunal issue an Award:\n\n(a) declaring that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Servier\u2019s claims as (1) there is no legal nexus between the impugned decisions and the Claimed Investments; (2) Servier seeks damages for injury suffered by it in its capacity as exporter;\n\n(b) declaring that [REDACTED].\n\n(c) declaring that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to resolve claims that Poland has expropriated any [REDACTED] listed in Appendix 2 to Servier\u2019s Statement of Claim, as [REDACTED] and\n\n(d) declaring that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to resolve Servier\u2019s Additional Claims;\n\n(e) to the extent that the Tribunal reaches the merits, declaring that Poland\u2019s measures do not contravene its obligations under Article 5(2) of the Treaty for the following reasons, whether taken individually or jointly: (1) there has been no interference with Servier\u2019s rights in, or control over, the Claimed Investments; (2) the evidence does not establish that Poland\u2019s measures have eliminated the value of the Claimed Investments; (3) the evidence does not establish that Poland\u2019s measures can give rise to permanent or irreversible effects on the Claimed Investments; (4) Poland\u2019s measures involved a valid exercise of regulatory powers; (5) Poland\u2019s measures did not violate any legitimate expectations arising from Servier\u2019s acquisition of the Claimed Investments and Poland did not obtain any economic benefits from its measures; (6) Poland\u2019s measures were taken pursuant to obligations under the EU Treaty which is a subsequent treaty binding Poland and France; and\n\n(f) declaring that Poland\u2019s measures do not contravene Articles 3, 4(1) and 5(1) of the Treaty;\n\n(g) in the event the Tribunal finds Poland liable, ruling that (1) the value of the Claimed Investments, as of 31 December 2008, was [REDACTED] (2) the appropriate rate of interest to be applied is 3 percent per annum compounded annually; and (3) any award of damages should be reduced to account for Servier\u2019s failure to mitigate;\n\n(h) ordering the Claimants to pay all costs incurred in connection with these arbitration proceedings including their own costs, the costs of the arbitrators and the Registry, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by Poland including the fees of its legal counsel, experts and consultants, the travel costs and other expenses of its representatives and the costs for translation, on a full indemnity basis, plus interest thereon at such commercial rate as the Tribunal thinks fit and on a compound basis;\n\n(i) excluding from the record of this arbitration Exhibit C-255 and the document referenced in footnote 10 of Servier\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief; and\n\n(j) rejecting Servier\u2019s request that all documents and information generated in the expert re-evaluation process be excluded from the record of this arbitration.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\nA. OVERVIEW\n-----------\n\n**1. Summary of Conclusions**\n-----------------------------\n\n510.\n\nFor the reasons set forth below, the Tribunal concludes that it possesses jurisdiction under the France-Poland BIT with respect to assets [REDACTED].\n\n511.\n\nThe Tribunal confirms the view expressed in its Interim Award of 3 December 2010 to the effect that the MFN provisions in Article 4(1) of the France-Poland BIT do not expand arbitral competence in the present proceedings, with the consequence that BIT Article 8(2) applies to restrict the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to disputes relating to alleged divestment under Article 5(2), to the exclusion of the Claimants\u2019 Non-Expropriation Claims. Moreover, the Tribunal has not been persuaded that the applicable law provisions of the BIT, including Article 8(3), operate to expand its jurisdiction in these proceedings.\n\n512.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n513.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n514.\n\nPrior to presenting its analysis, the Tribunal sets forth the key Treaty provisions on which it relies.\n\n**2. Key Treaty Provisions**\n----------------------------\n\n515.\n\nBIT Article 1(1) defines \"investment\" as follows:\n\nThe term \"investment\" shall mean assets such as property, rights and interests of any kind related to an economic activity in any sector whatsoever, in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory or maritime areas the investment has been made, including inter alia, but not limited to:\n\n(a) Movable and immovable property and all other real rights such as mortgages, liens, usufructs, sureties and similar rights;\n\n(b) Shares, share premiums and other forms of holdings, even minority or indirect, in companies incorporated in the territory of either Party;\n\n(c) Bonds, debts and rights to any benefit having an economic value;\n\n(d) Copyrights, industrial property rights (such as patents for inventions, licenses, registered trademarks, industrial models and designs), technical processes, registered names and clientele, provided that the said assets related to an economic activity must be or must have been invested in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party in whose territory or maritime areas the investment is made, before or after the entry into force of this Agreement.\n\n516.\n\nBIT Article 5(2) imposes the following host-state responsibilities with respect to divestment of an investor\u2019s property:\n\nThe Contracting Parties shall not take any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other measures which would have the effect of divesting investors of the other Party, either directly or indirectly, of investments belonging to them in its territory or maritime areas, except for reasons of public necessity and on condition that these measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking.\n\nAny divestment measures that may be taken shall give rise to the payment of prompt and adequate compensation, the amount of which shall correspond to the real value of the investments in question on the day before the measures are taken or made known to the public.\n\nSuch compensation, its amount and its method of payment shall be determined no later than the date of divestment. The compensation shall be effectively realizable, paid without delay and freely transferable. It shall yield, up to the date of payment, interest calculated on the basis of the appropriate rate of interest in force at the time of divestment.\n\n517.\n\nThe dispute resolution clause in BIT Article 8 provides as follows:\n\n1. Any dispute relating to investments between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party shall, as far as possible, be settled amicably between the two parties concerned or, failing that, through internal means of recourse.\n\n2. However, disputes relating to the divestment measures referred to in article 5, paragraph 2, particularly those relating to possible compensation, its amount and terms of payment and the interest payable in the event of a delay in payment, shall be settled according to the following conditions:\n\nIf any such dispute has not been settled amicably within six months from the time when the matter was raised by one of the parties to the dispute, it shall, at the request of either party, be submitted to arbitration. It shall be settled definitively in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, as adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations in resolution 31/98 of 15 December 1976.\n\nWhen both Contracting Parties have become parties to the Convention on the settlement of investment disputes between States and nationals of other States, signed at Washington on 18 March 1965, any such dispute which has not been settled amicably within six months from the time when the matter was raised by one of the parties to the dispute shall be submitted for arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.\n\n3. The arbitral tribunal shall rule in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law.\n\nB. JURISDICTION\n---------------\n\n**1. Jurisdiction Ratione Personae**\n------------------------------------\n\n518.\n\nThe Treaty defines an \"investor\" to include \"[a]ny corporate body incorporated in the territory of either Contracting Party in accordance with the laws of that Party and having its registered office therein.\" It is common ground between the two sides that all the Claimants are incorporated and registered in France, and thus qualify as investors pursuant to the definition of BIT Article 1(2)(b).\n\n**2. Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae**\n------------------------------------\n\n***(1) Non-Divestment Claims***\n-------------------------------\n\n519.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Interim Award of 3 December 2010 rejected the view that the Most Favoured Nation clause in the France-Poland BIT allowed invocation of provisions in other investment treaties covering so-called \"Non-Expropriation Claims\" related to fair and equitable treatment, non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory treatment, national treatment, and/or full protection and security of investments. The Tribunal held that the notion of \"treatment\" in Article 4(1) of the France-Poland BIT does not encompass international arbitration, which remained subject to the limitations of Article 8. Article 8 provides for arbitration only for divestment measures referred to in Article 5(2) of the BIT.\n\n520.\n\nThe Interim Award, however, deferred ruling on the Claimants\u2019 contention that the Tribunal might apply substantive norms related to fair and equitable treatment (BIT Article 3) and full protection and security (BIT Article 5). Such claims arguably could be entered into consideration by virtue of the BIT Article 8(3), which directs the Tribunal to \"rule in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the rules and principles of international law.\" According to the Claimants, the Tribunal possesses subject matter jurisdiction to apply rules of decision that vindicate claims for fair and equitable treatment or full protection and security. In this connection, the Claimants seek support in Article 33(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, which provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall apply the law designated by the parties as applicable to the substance of the dispute.\"\n\n521.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 argument on this point must fail. Although claims for expropriation and related compensation often intersect with applications related to unfair and inequitable treatment, or denial of full protection and security, each claim category remains distinct in nature, with potentially divergent evidentiary requirements, remedies and standards for quantum of compensation.\n\n522.\n\nJurisdiction to vindicate rights related to expropriation cannot create authority to decide claims derived from other rights in a treaty which by its terms grants recourse to arbitration only for limited types of claims, and moreover expressly provides for \"internal means of recourse\" as the default mechanism to address controversies connected to other substantive entitlements.\n\n523.\n\nThe drafters of the France-Poland BIT were careful to set forth the general rule that \"internal means of recourse\" would address disputes not resolved through amicable settlement, adding in the next sentence a \"however\" to introduce coverage for controverted divestment measures related to compensation and terms of payment.\n\n524.\n\nAdmittedly, as discussed below, notions of unfairness and discrimination may insert themselves into a discussion of what constitutes divestment of property.\n\n525.\n\nHowever, it would constitute an unacceptable stretch of logic to presume that authority to adjudicate requests related to one set of alleged wrongs can *ipso facto* create arbitral power to decide a different variety of claims.\n\n526.\n\nThe Tribunal finds support in this conclusion in the principles set forth in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which stresses the \"ordinary meaning\" of treaty terms viewed \"in their context and in the light of... [the Treaty\u2019s] object and purpose.\" Thus reference to \"provisions of this Agreement\" and the \"rules and principles of international law\" in BIT Article 8(3) must be read in light of the contextual limitation on jurisdiction contained in BIT Article 5(2).\n\n527.\n\nThe choice of forum provisions in BIT Articles 8(1) and 8(2) must be given some effect. Had the general default reference to resolution of disputes by \"internal means of recourse\" been inserted in *pari passu* with the arbitration provisions, one might argue that they took equal status in the Treaty\u2019s adjudicatory hierarchy, giving investors an option between one path or the other, depending on strategic or tactical considerations.\n\n528.\n\nSuch is not the structure of the France-Poland BIT, however. The arbitration provisions of Article 8(2) contain the mandatory \"shall\" instead of the precatory \"may\" followed by two paragraphs outlining reference to the UNCITRAL and ICSID arbitration schemes.\n\n529.\n\nIn the context of the current dispute, the Tribunal finds no justification for allowing choice-of-law rules to serve as a back door through which to import forum selection provisions contrary to treaty terms.\n\n***(2) Treaty-Protected Investments***\n--------------------------------------\n\n(a) Scope of Protection\n-----------------------\n\n530.\n\nThe Tribunal must now address whether the claims in these proceedings implicate assets that qualify as investments which are protected against divestment by the France-Poland BIT. For these purposes, the definitional provisions in Article 1 of the BIT must be read in the context of the relationship between \"investor\" and \"investment\" set forth in BIT Article 5(2).\n\n531.\n\nOne contracting state shall not take expropriation or nationalization measures which would have the effect of divesting \"investors of the other Party\" of investments \"belonging to them [i.e., to investors of the other contracting state]\" when such investments are located \"in its ***[i.e.,*** the allegedly expropriating state\u2019s] territory or maritime areas.\"\n\n532.\n\nThe expression \"belonging to\" in the context of this BIT would most reasonably connote ownership and a sense of rightful entitlement. Notably, the BIT contains no qualification of \"belonging to\" that would preclude an ownership interest that might be partial or indirect.\n\n533.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n534.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n535.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n536.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n537.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n538.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n539.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n540.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n541.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n542.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n543.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n544.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n545.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n546.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n547.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n548.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n549.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n550.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n551.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n552.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n553.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n554.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n555.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n556.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n557.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n558.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n559.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n560.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n561.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n562.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nC. DIVESTMENT\n-------------\n\n**1. Treaty Framework**\n-----------------------\n\n563.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the France-Poland BIT establishes a series of interconnected mandates for this Tribunal\u2019s determinations on liability and quantum. The first subparagraph of section (2) prohibits divestment of investments that \"belong to\" investors, except for reasons of public necessity and on condition that these measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking.\n\n564.\n\nSignificantly, however, the second subparagraph of Article 5(2) provides that \"any\" divestment measures (whether illicit or not) shall give rise to prompt and adequate compensation.1009 The provision does not distinguish between whether divestment measures prove legitimate or not pursuant to the criteria of the first subparagraph, but states simply as follows:\n\nAny divestment measures that may be taken shall give rise to the payment of prompt and adequate compensation, the amount of which shall correspond to the real value of the investments in question on the day before the measures are taken or made known to the public.\n\nAs mentioned earlier the Tribunal has, with one exception noted *supra,* used the English version of the France-Poland BIT published in the UN Treaty Series, submitted as Exhibit R-001.\n\n565.\n\nThe French and Polish texts of the second paragraph accord with the English translation cited above. The French speaks of \"les mesures de d\u00e9possession qui pourraient \u00eatre prises.\"\n\n566.\n\nThe English translation of the Polish text provided by the Respondent as Exhibit R-007 uses the word \"any\" to render that phrase as \"The application of any expropriation measures shall entail the prompt payment,\" translating from the Polish \"Zastosowanie\u00a0\u015brodk\u00f3w wyw\u0142aszczeniowych powinno\u00a0poci\u0105gn\u0105\u0107 za sob\u0105 niezw\u0142oczn\u0105 wyp\u0142at\u0119 w\u0142a\u015bciwego odszkodowania.\" Consequently, as a preliminary matter the Tribunal must determine the nature of divestment measures, and whether or not such measures violated the first subparagraph of Article 5(2).\n\n567.\n\nIf divestment has occurred, then the Tribunal is called to fix compensation for the \"real value\" of the investment. The Tribunal must also determine whether violations occurred with respect to the first subparagraph, and if so what consequences might follow beyond the requirement to pay for the \"real value\" of the investment.\n\n568.\n\nEvaluating Poland\u2019s actions in light of its Treaty obligations with respect to divestment, the Tribunal must accord due deference to the decisions of specialized Polish administrators interpreting and applying laws and regulations governing their area of competence. In doing so, however, the Tribunal will also consider the manner in which these decisions were taken and their effect on the Claimants\u2019 investments.\n\n**2. Exercise of Administrative Power**\n---------------------------------------\n\n***(1) Nature of Divestment***\n------------------------------\n\n569.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties that a host state\u2019s regulatory and/or administrative actions must be taken (i) in good faith, (ii) for a public purpose, (iii) in a way proportional to that purpose, and (iv) in a non-discriminatory manner.1010\n\n*Comnare* Statement of Claim, para. 215 *and* Reply, para. 283 *with* Statement of Defence, para. 490.\n\n570.\n\nStated from a somewhat different perspective, the Respondent\u2019s denial of marketing authorisations would divest the Claimants of their property, giving rise to a requirement of compensation under the BIT, if Poland exercised its administrative and regulatory powers in bad faith, for some non-public purpose, or in a fashion that was either discriminatory or lacking in proportionality between the public purpose and the actions taken.\n\n571.\n\nThe standard set forth above relates to \"any\" divestment as articulated in the second subparagraph of Article 5(2) of the BIT, and is not specific to the illicit dispossession covered in the first subparagraph of that provision.\n\n572.\n\nThe Tribunal is well aware that any divestment as such must be followed by compensation pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 5(2), regardless of whether the divestment entails illicit actions covered by the first subparagraph of that section which prohibits certain types of expropriations.\n\n573.\n\nThe Tribunal must take BIT Article 5(2) as drafted. One portion of that provision imposes a negative rule that expropriation or nationalization measures not be taken except for reasons of public necessity and provided that such measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a particular obligation. Another portion of the provision imposes a positive mandate that any divestment shall give rise to adequate compensation.\n\n574.\n\nFor reasons set forth below, the Tribunal has found a divestment.\n\n575.\n\nMoreover, the divestment violates the mandates of the first subparagraph. Not only was the refusal of authorisation discriminatory, but the regulatory measures were disproportionate in nature and thus not a matter of public necessity. However, the Tribunal does not find that the divestment calls for damages beyond those set out in Article 5(2) of the Treaty in the form of \"real value\" compensation.\n\n576.\n\nIn this connection, the Tribunal notes that indirect expropriation, at issue in this case, implicates a State\u2019s substantial interference with an investor\u2019s rights. Such interference must be significant, even if not complete, in the sense of depriving the investor of its ability to benefit from the relevant asset.\n\n577.\n\nThe Tribunal also stresses that the terms of the France-Poland BIT do not require that dispossession be permanent in the sense of continuing *ad infinitum,* although deprivation must possess a character which is more than transitory. [REDACTED]\n\n***(2) Burden of Proof***\n-------------------------\n\n578.\n\nThe Parties disagree on who bears the burden of proof on whether Poland exercised its regulatory and administrative powers in a legitimate fashion.\n\n579.\n\nThe Claimants point to Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules which provides: \"Each party shall have the burden of proving the facts relied on to support his claim or defence.\" The Claimants view a plea of valid exercise of regulatory powers as an \"affirmative defense,\" for which Poland bears the burden of proof.\n\n580.\n\nBy contrast, Poland argues that its sole duty is to show that there is a reasonable connection between its actions and a legitimate policy objective.\n\n581.\n\nThe Tribunal takes an approach that includes elements of each perspective.\n\n582.\n\nPoland has come forward with *prima facie* justifications for rejecting the Claimants\u2019 applications for marketing authorisations. According to Poland, the rejection derived from provisions of, and policies associated with, the Polish Pharmaceutical Law and EU\n\n583.\n\nIn light of such explanations, it would be unreasonable to demand that Poland \"prove the negative\" in the sense of demonstrating an absence of bad faith and discrimination, or the lack of disproportionateness in the measures taken.\n\n584.\n\nThus, the burden then falls onto the Claimants to show that Poland\u2019s regulatory actions were inconsistent with a legitimate exercise of Poland\u2019s police powers. If the Claimants produce sufficient evidence for such a showing, the burden shifts to Poland to rebut it.\n\n585.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n586.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n587.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n588.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n589.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n590.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n591.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n592.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n593.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n594.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n595.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n596.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n597.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n598.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n599.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n600.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n601.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n602.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n603.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n604.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n605.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n606.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n607.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n608.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n609.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n610.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n611.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n612.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n613.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n614.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n615.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n616.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n617.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n618.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n619.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n620.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n621.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n622.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n623.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n624.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n625.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n626.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n627.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n628.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n629.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n630.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n631.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n632.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n633.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n634.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n635.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n636.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n637.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n638.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n639.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n640.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n641.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nD. DAMAGES\n----------\n\n**1. Legal Standard**\n---------------------\n\n642.\n\nGiven the Tribunal\u2019s finding that Poland has not engaged in bad faith behaviour in a way that would require damages beyond the Treaty standard, the Tribunal must simply apply the standard of compensation for the divestment of \"any\" investment under BIT Article 5(2).\n\n643.\n\nAccording to that provision, divestment shall give rise to payment of \"prompt and adequate compensation\" corresponding to the \"real value\" of the divested investments on the day before the measures were taken or made public.\n\n644.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Tribunal interprets the second subparagraph of BIT Article 5(2) as setting the standard of compensation for any divestment, not just what might be called \"permitted\" expropriations which did not violate the earlier prohibitions on discrimination, breach of specific undertakings, and reasons of public necessity.\n\n645.\n\nAlthough no single interpretation may prove entirely satisfactory under all circumstances, the reading of the Treaty that comports with common sense would provide a floor of \"real value\" compensation for all divestments (not just legitimate takings), allowing tribunals discretion to impose additional sanctions to punish Treaty violations of particular seriousness, such as discrimination or breach of specific undertakings.\n\n**2. Valuation**\n----------------\n\n646.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n647.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n648.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n649.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n650.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n651.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n652.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n653.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n654.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n655.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n656.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n657.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n658.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n659.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n660.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n661.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n662.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n**3. Pre-Award Interest**\n-------------------------\n\n663.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the BIT provides that compensation \"shall yield, up to the date of payment, interest calculated on the basis of the appropriate rate of interest in force at the time of divestment.\"\n\n664.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the last sentence of Article 5(2) (\"interest in force at the time of divestment\"). The connotation of the phrase \"rate of interest in force\" is that the Treaty looks to some rate external to the particular capital costs of the Parties\u2019 own transaction. In searching for an appropriate rate, the Tribunal finds guidance in the 12-month EURIBOR.\n\n665.\n\nThe Tribunal will compound interest on an annual basis using the 12-month EURIBOR rate which, as mandated in the Treaty, was \"in force at the time of the divestment,\" which is to say, on 31 December 2008. Thus, the Tribunal applies the EURIBOR rate of 3,049 percent from the date of divestment until the date of the Award, yielding [REDACTED] in interest. This same interest rate will also apply to post-Award interest until the time of payment.\n\n**4. Tax Ramifications of Award**\n---------------------------------\n\n666.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal has considered the possible tax ramifications of this Award, it can find no reason to speculate on the appropriateness, one way or another, of any proposed \"gross-up\" to take into account potential tax liability, whether in Poland or in France. The ultimate tax treatment of an award representing the \"real value\" of an investment must be addressed by the fiscal authorities in the investor\u2019s home jurisdiction as well as the host state.\n\n**5. Post-Award Interest**\n--------------------------\n\n667.\n\nBIT Article 5(2) provides that compensation \"shall yield, up to the date of payment, interest calculated on the basis of the appropriate rate of interest in force at the time of the dispossession.\"\n\n668.\n\nThus, from the date of the Award, until fully paid, that amount shall be subject to annual compound interest at a rate equal to the 12-month EURIBOR in force on 31 December 2008. namely 3,049 percent.\n\nE. COSTS\n--------\n\n669.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that both sides have presented some meritorious arguments, each side winning on some issues while losing on others.\n\n670.\n\nMany of the arguments were finely balanced. Neither side advanced its case in bad faith. Neither position was clearly untenable.\n\n671.\n\nCounsel for both sides behaved in ways which furthered procedural efficiency, and no abuse of process was present. Counsel for all Parties evidenced a high degree of efficiency and professionalism in pleading their respective cases.\n\n672.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that each Party shall bear its own attorneys\u2019 fees and related other costs, and that the costs of arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrators and the administrative expenses of the PCA, shall be divided on an equal (50/50) basis.\n\n673.\n\nThe total costs of the arbitration, including arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses, as well as PCA administrative expenses, are set at [REDACTED]\n\n**VIII. DISPOSITION**\n---------------------\n\n674.\n\nThe Tribunal has subject-matter jurisdiction only over claims of expropriation under Article 5(2) of the Treaty.\n\n675.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n676.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n677.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n678.\n\nEach Party will bear its own legal costs and a half share of the arbitrators\u2019 and PCA fees.\n\n679.\n\n[REDACTED]"}]}
