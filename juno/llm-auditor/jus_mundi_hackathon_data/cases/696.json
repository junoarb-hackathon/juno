PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn June 6, 2003, El Paso Energy International Company, incorporated in the State of Delaware of the United States of America (hereinafter \"El Paso\", \"the Claimant\"), filed a request for arbitration against the Republic of Argentine (hereinafter \"the Government\", \"Argentina\" or \"the Respondent\") with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter \"the Centre\" or \"ICSID\"). The Claimant alleges that Argentina has violated the 1991 Treaty Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment between the Argentine Republic and the United States of America (hereinafter \"the BIT\"; bilateral investment treaties in general will be referred to as BITs), other rules of international law, the Hydrocarbon Concessions and Contracts as well as the Argentine Constitution.\n\n2.\n\nThe Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Claimant\u2019s request for arbitration on 12 June 2003. The parties agreed that the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each party, the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal to be appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the Centre. Accordingly, the Claimant appointed Professor Piero Bernardini (Italian) as an arbitrator, whereas the Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern (French) as an arbitrator. The Chairman, with the agreement of the parties, appointed Professor Lucius Caflisch (Swiss) as President of the Arbitral Tribunal. On 6 February 2004, the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted, and the proceedings to have commenced. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were notified that Ms. Gabriela Alvarez-Avila, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n3.\n\nMr. R. Doak Bishop of King & Spalding and Mr. Jos\u00e9 A. Martinez de Hoz (Jr.) of P\u00e9rez Alati, Grondona Benites, Amtsen & Mart\u00ednez de Hoz (Jr.) represent the Claimant. Dr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Gugliemino, *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina,* represents the Respondent.\n\n4.\n\nThe first session in this case was held on 21 April 2004 in Geneva, Switzerland. The Claimant was represented at that session by MM. R. Doak Bishop and Jos\u00e9 A. Mart\u00ednez de Hoz (Jr.). Mr. Jorge Barraguirre and Ms. Maria Vallejos Meana of the *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n,* Buenos Aires, acting on instructions from the then *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n,* Dr. Horacio Daniel Rosatti, represented the Respondent at the first session.\n\n5.\n\nAt that session, the parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and that they had no objection to any of the members of the Tribunal, and it was noted that the proceedings would be conducted under the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force since 1 January 2003 (hereinafter \"the Arbitration Rules\"). In respect of the pleadings to be filed by the parties, their number, sequence and timing, the Tribunal announced, after consultation with the parties, that the Claimant would file its Memorial within 90 days of the date of the first session, and the Respondent its Counter-Memorial within 90 days of the date of receipt of the Memorial; the Claimant\u2019s Reply would be submitted within 45 days of the date of receipt of the Counter-Memorial, and the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder within 45 days of its receipt of the Reply. It was further agreed that the Respondent had the right to raise any objections it might have to jurisdiction not later than 45 days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial. If such objections were made by the Respondent, the Claimant would be entitled to file a Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction within 45 days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on jurisdiction. The Tribunal would decide at a later stage, after having consulted the parties, whether a second round of pleadings on jurisdiction would be necessary.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant filed its Memorial on the merits on 20 August 2004. The Respondent filed its Memorial on jurisdiction on 19 October 2004 and the Claimant its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction on 13 December 2004. After having considered the views of the parties, the Tribunal decided on 3 February 2005 that a second round of pleadings on jurisdiction was not necessary and fixed the date for the hearings on jurisdiction on 7 April 2005. On 25 February 2005, the Tribunal re-scheduled the hearing on jurisdiction for 8 April 2005.\n\n7.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction took place in Paris, France, on 8 April 2005. The Claimant was represented by MM. R. Doak Bishop, Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz (Jr.), Tomasz J. Sikora and Craig S. Miles, and by Ms. Valeria Macchia and Angolie Singh on behalf of the Claimant. Mr. Jorge Barraguirre, Ms. Gisela Makowski, and Ms. Cintia Yaryura from the *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n* represented the Respondent.\n\n8.\n\nAt the hearing, at the Respondent\u2019s request, Mr. Ed Sereno gave testimony. The Claimant briefly presented the witness; this was followed by cross-examination from the Respondent and re-direct from the Claimant. The Tribunal then asked the witness some questions. Transcriptions of the hearing were made in English and Spanish, and were distributed to the Tribunal and the parties.\n\n9.\n\nDuring the hearing on jurisdiction, the Tribunal requested documents from both parties. By letter of 14 April 2005, the Claimant responded to a request regarding the sale of its shares in Compa\u00f1ias Asociadas Petroleras SA, CAPEX SA and Servicios El Paso SRL. On 6 May 2005, the Respondent asked for certain documents to the Tribunal regarding the financial structure of Transportadora Gas del Norte and Metrogas, as well as taxes imposed on the Gas sector. In the letter accompanying the request, the Respondent asked for the production by the Claimant of documents regarding its investment and the sale of its shares in the above-mentioned companies. On 10 June 2005, the Claimant objected to that request. The Respondent replied to the Claimant\u2019s objections by a letter of 27 June 2005. The Tribunal, by Procedural Order No. 1 of 28 July 2005, decided that\n\n\"the information in possession of the Tribunal [was] sufficient to decide the jurisdictional issues raised by the Respondent and that, if the proceedings [would] reach the merits of the dispute, it [would] be open to the Respondent to reiterate the above request for production of documents.\"\n\n**II. GENERAL PRESENTATION OF THE CASE**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Background of the Case: The Argentine Economic and Financial Crisis**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe global economic and financial situation forming the background of the present case has been aptly described by the ICSID Tribunal in *Natural Gas SDG, S.A.* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Preliminary Questions on Jurisdiction of 17 June 2005 (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/10, http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/GasNaturalSDG-DecisiononPreliminaryQuestionsonJurisdiction.pdf). as follows (\u00a7\u00a7 11-15):\n\n\"11. In 1991, Argentina embarked on a program of economic expansion to be carried out in significant part through privatization of state-owned enterprises and attraction of foreign direct investment. Argentina concluded more than fifty bilateral investment agreements, and undertook by law to guarantee the convertibility of the Argentine peso. A currency board was created to maintain the parity between the peso and the United States dollar, by limiting the local money supply to the amount of Argentina\u2019s foreign exchange reserves. A major part of the privatization program concerned selling previously state-owned public utilities, including the entity involved in the present arbitration.\n\n12. For a variety of reasons beyond the scope of the present arbitration, the effort by the government of Argentina to maintain the parity of the peso and the U.S. dollar came under heavy pressure at the end of the decade of the 1990\u2019s. For a time Argentina was able to draw on foreign credits, but by December 2001 it had become clear that no further credits were available to Argentina in the near future, and that devaluation was inevitable.\n\n13. On December 2, 2001, President Fernando de la R\u00faa issued a decree prohibiting transfers of foreign exchange abroad over a nominal amount. In the following days the government limited cash withdrawals from banks, a general strike and riots broke out, and President de la R\u00faa declared a state of siege. On December 20, 2001, President de la R\u00faa resigned. On December 23, 2001, his successor, Adolfo Rodriguez Sa\u00e1, declared a default on Argentina\u2019s public debt, estimated at 132 billion U.S. dollars. President Rodriguez Sa\u00e1 resigned one week later, and (skipping one brief interim designation), the presidency was assumed on January 1, 2002 by Eduardo Duhalde. President Duhalde remained in office until an election in May 2003, and many of the measures relevant to the present arbitration were taken in his administration.\n\n14. On January 6, 2002, with the consent of Congress in a Ley de Emergencia (Emergency Law), President Duhalde repealed the legal requirement that 1 peso = 1 U.S. dollar and set a new rate at 1.40 pesos = 1 U.S. dollar. Banks, which had been closed on December 23, 2001, remained closed. The new rate did not hold, and by mid-January, the unofficial rate was close to 2 pesos = 1 U.S. dollar. The prohibition on remittances abroad remained in effect.\n\n15. On February 2, 2002, the government ordered all banks to turn over their U.S. dollars to the Central Bank. The prohibition on transfers of foreign exchange abroad without authorization from the Central Bank was reconfirmed, with no indication as to how long the prohibition would last or whether any transfers might be authorized.\"\n\n**2. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nEl Paso is a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware (United States). It owns a 99.92% indirect controlling shareholding in Servicios El Paso SRL (\"Servicios\") and indirect non-controlling shareholdings in Compa\u00f1\u00edas Asociadas Petroleras SA (\"CAPSA\"), CAPEX SA (\"CAPEX\"), Central Costanera SA (\"Costanera\") and Gasoducto del Pac\u00edfico SA (\"Pac\u00edfico\"). CAPSA, CAPEX, Costanera and Pac\u00edfico will hereafter be collectively referred to as the \"Argentine Companies\", all being incorporated under the laws of Argentina. El Paso owns a 45% interest in CAPSA, the latter having a 60% interest in CAPEX (for a graphic representation of the structure of the El Paso group, see Request for Arbitration, Exhibit 8).\n\n12.\n\nCAPSA is engaged in the exploration, development and production of oil and, through CAPEX, in the generation of power. CAPSA is mainly in the business of generating electrical power and, accessorily, in the exploration, development and production of crude oil and gas as well as in the marketing of propane, butane and gasoline. According to the Claimant, a series of measures taken by the Government since December 2001 were in breach of fundamental undertakings by which it had induced El Paso and other foreign investors to invest in Argentina, replacing these undertakings by conditions which have proved devastating to the Claimant and have amounted to an expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s investment. Under the new scheme, CAPEX could no longer function independently; El Paso\u2019s investment in the latter and in CAPSA was rendered essentially worthless; and the new conditions have also adversely affected Servicios, Costanera and Pac\u00edfico. Under the Argentina-US Treaty Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment concluded on 14 November 1991 and entered into force on 20 October 1994 (*ibid.,* Exhibit 1), the Government\u2019s actions, according to the Claimant, amount to expropriation.\n\n13.\n\nFrom 1997 onward El Paso invested significant cash equity in CAPSA, thereby acquiring a 45% ownership interest in it. CAPSA in turn owns about 60% of CAPEX. The latter holds a hydrocarbon production concession (\"the CAPEX concession\") in two fields (\"El Salitral\" and \"Agua del Caj\u00f3n\") and owns a thermoelectric power plant at the latter field in the Neuqu\u00e9n Province. CAPEX is a low-cost producer of thermoelectric energy thanks to ownership of both gas wells and modern production facilities.\n\n14.\n\nServicios, a subsidiary of the Claimant, was established in Argentina in March 1998. In late 1999, it entered into a contract with the Argentine branch of a foreign financial institution pursuant to which it leased a gas-processing plant at the Agua del Caj\u00f3n field. Under a ten-year gas-processing agreement with CAPEX made on 23 November 1999 (the \"Gas Processing Agreement\"), Servicios processed gas produced at CAPEX\u2019s fields into liquid petroleum by-products which then were sold.\n\n15.\n\nIn April 1997, El Paso acquired, through KLT Power, Inc., a US company totally owned by it, an indirect shareholding of about 12% in Costanera, an entity generating and selling electricity in Argentina; Costanera is currently, according to the Claimant, the largest thermal generator of electricity in Argentina, its plant including two modern cycle units located in the city of Buenos Aires.\n\n16.\n\nIn January 1998, El Paso also acquired an indirect and non-controlling interest in Pac\u00edfico, an entity owning and operating a natural-gas pipeline linking Argentina with the Chilean city of Concepcion. El Paso indirectly owns about 13.4% of Pacifico\u2019s preferred shares and 11.8% of its ordinary shares.\n\n17.\n\nIn short, El Paso possesses indirect and non-controlling shareholdings in CAPSA, CAPEX, Costanera and Pac\u00edfico, and an indirect controlling shareholding in Servicios (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 2-8 and 17-23).\n\n18.\n\nThe regulatory environment in Argentina when El Paso made its investment shall be described next, beginning with the pre-1990 situation. Before 1990, the Argentine electricity services were dominated by the public sector. The Federal Government owned the production, transmission and distribution services. In addition, some of the Provinces ran their own electricity companies. According to the Claimant, these services were characterised by inefficiency of management and inadequate capital investment; this meant deteriorating facilities, poor service, high tariffs and recurrent financial crises. The same situation prevailed in the oil and gas sectors, the private sector playing a secondary role under contracts concluded with State oil and gas companies. To the 1989 recession the Government attempted to respond by a series of plans embodying various systems of exchange controls, but that strategy failed. It then turned to a strategy of investment incentives, promoting monetary and structural reforms to stabilise the economy and to induce foreign private investors to engage themselves in Argentina, promising stable laws and rules and \"respect for investors\u2019 reasonable expectations\" (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 24-27).\n\n19.\n\nIn August 1989, Laws Nos. 23,696 and 23,697 (the \"State Reform Law\" and the \"Economic Emergency Law\") provided for the de-regulation of the economy and the privatisation of Government-owned companies, gave the Government authority to re-organise them, and put some State assets and most State companies up for privatisation. The next measures, provided for in 1991 by Law No. 23,928 and by Regulatory Decree No. 529/91 (referred to together as \"Convertibility Law\"), were aimed at inflation control and re-structuring of the economy. The Convertibility Law fixed the parity of the national currency at one peso to one US dollar, requiring the Central Bank to sell dollars in exchange for pesos at that rate, and prescribed that no increase in the domestic monetary mass could occur without an increase in the Bank\u2019s foreign holdings. As a result, inflation abated and the economy grew in the period from 1991 to 1997. In 1993, the Argentine Congress passed legislation to abolish the three-year waiting period for the repatriation of foreign capital, allowing foreign investors to proceed to repatriation at any time, and to organise themselves and to make use of domestic credit on a footing of equality with national investors. Finally, in yet another effort to attract foreign investors, Argentina concluded a series of bilateral investment treaties, including one with the United States. Those instruments assured foreign investors that their investments would be granted at all times \"fair and equitable\" treatment, and treatment in accordance with international law; and they provided that foreign investors would not be expropriated, in law or fact, without prompt, adequate and effective compensation. So much for the general framework in which El Paso\u2019s investments were embedded (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 28-31).\n\n20.\n\nIt will now be convenient to introduce the Energy Regulatory Framework, which is made up of the Electricity Regulatory Framework and the Oil and Gas Regulatory Framework, and to assess its impact.\n\n21.\n\nThe Electricity Regulatory Framework, consisting of Law No. 24,065 (\"the Electricity Law\"), Decree No. 1398/92 (\"the Electricity Decree\") and related regulations, was intended to attract foreign indirect investment to the electricity sector, treating separately the production, transmission and distribution of electric power. It aimed at achieving lower tariffs, better service and better management, and at generating competition by attracting investors, especially from abroad. Under this Framework, privatised *distribution companies* competed for long-term concession contracts under federal and provincial regulatory supervision. These contracts, together with the Electricity Regulatory Framework, ensured that the tariffs for end users would: (i) reflect reasonable distribution costs set in dollars, to be reviewed every five years (except for the city of Buenos Aires, where the first period was to be one of ten years) and, in the meantime, be adjusted bi-annually in accordance with the US Producer Price Index; and (ii) pass through the purchase price as set quarterly in the Wholesale Energy Market (WEM), regardless of whether or not the distributor actually bought energy directly from the generators. As far as *generators* such as CAPEX and Costanera were concerned, they could sell the power produced by them on the spot market and, under bilateral agreements, on the term market. Rules for the WEM were enacted in 1991. Under the rules on the spot market, generators would declare their variable production costs bi-annually in dollars, up to a ceiling of 115% of the relevant index price. Compa\u00f1\u00eda Administradora del Mercado Mayorista El\u00e9ctrico SA (\"CAMMESA\") would draw up a list of producers in ascending order of their declared variable production cost until the supply thus listed was sufficient to meet the estimated consumption. The producers on the list would then be despatched, on an hourly basis, to meet the actual demand. The price, which was uniform, was established on the basis of the cost of the highest-cost despatched generator. Generators on the despatch list would also receive a \"capacity payment\" intended to cover generators\u2019 fixed costs not included in the declared variable costs of energy, such as dollar-denominated capital investment costs. This system encouraged producers to operate with maximum efficiency since the most efficient were despatched first and, accordingly, obtained the largest margin (the difference between the spot price and their own - low - cost), and since they also received capacity payments. CAPEX being among the lowest-cost generators, the capacity payments made to it amounted to about 31.5 million US dollars per year. Apart from the spot market pricing system, generators could freely negotiate sales contracts with distributors, marketers, other generators, or large-scale users at prices and on terms mutually agreed. At any given time, 10% to 30% of CAPEX\u2019s production was disposed of through such contracts.\n\n22.\n\nIn 1989 the Government, by a series of enactments, sought to expand foreign investment by de-regulating the oil and gas industry. These enactments entitled the holders of production concessions to generate and dispose of hydrocarbons unrestrictedly, both in Argentina and abroad. Indeed, the Hydrocarbons Law No. 17,319, the Oil Deregulation Decrees and the Law No. 12,161 (\"Oil and Gas Regulatory Framework\") \u2014 pursuant to which the CAPEX and CAPSA concessions were granted \u2014 provided: (i) that hydrocarbon producers could export crude oil without prior Government consent; (ii) that exports were exempt from existing or future fees, rights or withholdings; and (iii) that prices were de-regulated so that producers were free to negotiate the terms of the sale of hydrocarbons on the open market.\n\n23.\n\nThe two systems described in the two preceding paragraphs, which made up the Energy Regulatory Framework, proved successful. In the nineties, investments totalling more than 34 billion dollars were made in the energy sector, 22 billion of which went into the oil and gas business and 12 billion into the power business. The sums borrowed by CAPEX on the international market supported an investment of 711 million dollars and those raised by CAPSA one of 568 million dollars. The funds were used to buy equipment, to procure engineering and construction services, to finance exploration and production activities, and to develop transportation and storage facilities. Between 1989 and 1999, momentous changes occurred, which are set out in detail in the Request for Arbitration (\u00a7\u00a7 41-45) and which included increased power, oil and gas production, an increase in proved oil and gas reserves, a considerable rise in exports of energy, and an expansion of the natural gas transmission system, including the construction of additional infrastructure to support Argentina\u2019s natural gas exports. The Energy Regulatory Framework remained in operation for more than a decade before the Government began to withdraw fundamental rights and safeguards from investors in the energy sector (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 32-45).\n\n24.\n\nThis withdrawal resulted in violations of the legal and contractual rights of El Paso and the Argentine Companies, as well as of international law, including the BIT, virtually destroying, according to the Claimant, its investments in CAPSA and CAPEX. Declaring an official default on foreign debt payments in December 2001, Argentina enacted Decree No. 1570/2001 (\"the Transfer Restrictions Decree\") restricting the withdrawal of bank deposits and exchange and transfers abroad, and according to which exporters were obligated to repatriate the proceeds of their sales abroad to the Argentine financial system. On 6 January 2002, the Government published Law No. 25,561 which: abolished the one-to-one exchange rate between dollar and peso set in 1991 by the Convertibility Law; re-denominated certain foreign-currency payment obligations in pesos; authorised the President of Argentina to renegotiate certain government contracts; froze all electricity prices and related indexation mechanisms; converted all prices and tariffs into pesos at an exchange rate of one to one; and prohibited distribution companies from suspending the performance of their obligations despite the unilateral revision of their public contracts by the Government. Furthermore, the latter changed the spot price fixing mechanisms, which affected generators such as CAPEX and Costanera (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 47-49).\n\n25.\n\nFour further regulatory measures were taken by the Government on 4 February 2002: the \"Pesification Decree\" No. 214/2002 (amended twice in the same year by Decrees Nos 320/2002 and 410/2002), which transformed all foreign currency obligations outstanding on 6 January of that year, including contractual liabilities in dollars, into peso obligations and, thus, caused considerable losses to CAPEX and Costanera; Decree No. 310/2002 establishing a new 20% export duty on crude oil and one of 5% on refined products, which caused CAPSA a significant loss in export revenues; Decree No. 867/2002 enabling the Secretary of Energy to establish quotas for crude oil and liquid petroleum gas reserved to the domestic market, which annulled the free export assurances in Decrees Nos. 1589/1989 and 1212/1989; although the restrictions were lifted later on, the authority given to the Energy Secretary unilaterally to establish export restrictions remains, and so does the uncertainty connected with it; and Decree No. 1090/2002, of 25 June 2002, which excluded from the re-negotiation of concessions companies that would sue the Government on account of the new enactments (freezing and \"pesifying\" tariff rates). The Pesification Decree referred to above was furthermore applied by CAMMESA in a way that placed an additional burden on producers whose fixed costs were dollar-denominated to a significant extent, including CAPEX and Costanera. The fuel reference price (which determines the maximum allowable cost to be used for establishing the spot price) was converted into pesos at the rate of one to one, thus imposing an arbitrary low maximum price when selling on the spot market (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 50-54).\n\n26.\n\nThe Government\u2019s measures have, according to the Claimant, adversely affected the rights of electricity producers: (i) the right to have spot market prices set at a uniform rate based on the marginal production cost; (ii) the right to have spot prices calculated in dollars; and (iii) the right to collect payments for spot energy supplies in accordance with pre-established conditions. Regarding the two last points, CAPEX and Costanera were denied their profit owing to the artificial cap placed on the price of power in the spot market; they were also deprived of the opportunity to receive capacity payments sufficient to service the debts related to their investment because the Government \"pesified\" those payments, this measure resulting in a two-thirds drop. Thus the Claimant, after having committed substantial resources to acquire and develop assets, suffered from a series of unpredictable Government measures that were inconsistent with the legal framework on which it had relied (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 55-61).\n\n27.\n\nIn addition, CAPEX had concluded dollar-denominated term contracts for the sale of energy and liquid petroleum gas by-products with third parties. Furthermore, the Government, despite the fact that CAPEX\u2019s contractual rights protected under the Argentine Constitution were thereby violated, restricted the possibility of generators to use the early-termination clauses in those contracts. The Pesification Decree also resulted in the pesification of the previously dollar-denominated operations and maintenance contracts between CAPEX and the plant\u2019s operator, Steag-Capime; the latter cancelled the contracts, which triggered a series of still outstanding claims and counter-claims.\n\n28.\n\nThese changes, and the failure of the Government to take preventive or mitigating measures against the impact of Law No. 25,561 on CAPEX\u2019s and Costanera\u2019s investments, have caused significant prejudice to these activities, affecting the investor\u2019s ability to write off for tax purposes their dollar investments at the same level as prior to the enactment of that Law. In addition, nothing was done to allow power investors to minimise losses under Law No. 25,561 in their tax returns. On the contrary, the Government placed higher restrictions on the deductions the investors could claim due to their losses under Law No. 25,561 (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 62-65).\n\n29.\n\nUnder the Gas and Oil Regulatory Framework applicable to CAPSA, investors in the hydrocarbons sector were to benefit from: (i) a right to export crude oil without prior Government consent; (ii) an exemption from existing or future fees, duties, rights or withholdings; (iii) the de-regulation of the prices of crude oil, entitling producers freely to negotiate prices of hydrocarbons on the open market; (iv) a constitutional guarantee given to negotiated agreements, including those of CAPSA and CAPEX, for the sale of liquid hydrocarbons. Contrary to those rules, the Government took unilateral measures: (i) violating the exemption of hydrocarbons exports from export duties and withholdings; (ii) amending conditions previously established for each international shipment of liquid hydrocarbons in connexion with liquefied petroleum gas and diesel oil, and repealing them with respect to crude oil as well as fixing export quotas; and (iii) ending the dollar-denominated sale and purchase agreements *via* pesification (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 66-70).\n\n30.\n\nThe impact of the Government\u2019s measures on the investments of El Paso and the Argentine Companies is summed up by the Claimant in three points: (i) CAPEX no longer has the resources for working profitably and meeting its financial and contractual obligations. It owes more than 275 million dollars and has been forced to default on its foreign debts, (ii) CAPSA has lost CAPEX, its main asset, which is no longer commercially viable. The Government\u2019s acts of expropriation have caused CAPSA to default on its 120 million-dollar debt, (iii) The business of Costanera has been adversely affected by the pesification of capacity payments, spot market prices and term contracts, and by the fact that the spot market prices are no longer established at a uniform tariff based on the economic cost of supplementing the incremental unit of electricity demand. The business of Servicios was also affected by the fact that its substantial financial debt was with a foreign bank not subjected to mandatory pesification; that debt was incurred by leasing the gas-processing plant at the Agua del Caj\u00f3n field. In addition, Servicios suffered from the Pesification Decree in that the latter brought about the pesification of dollar-denominated operations and of the maintenance contract between CAPEX and the operator of the plant, which was cancelled by the latter upon pesification. Finally, the revenues of Pac\u00edfico have decreased and have inhibited its ability to use freely its revenues resulting mainly from export sales, due to the forced repatriation and pesification and to the need for prior authorisation for the re-transfer abroad of export earnings (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 71-74).\n\n31.\n\nThe Government\u2019s measures have prevented the Claimant and the Argentine Companies from exercising the rights flowing from their investments. These rights include those based on the conditions defined by the Energy Regulatory Framework, by the law of contracts and by constitutional law. According to the Claimant, these categories of rules have been violated by the Government\u2019s measures, as have the provisions of the BIT, especially the guarantees contained in Articles II (2) (a) to (c), IV, V and XII.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the measures in question were in breach of Article II (2) (a) of the BIT, which requires the host State to grant investors of the other State fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, and treatment not less favourable that that required by international law. They were also arbitrary and discriminatory in that they adversely affected the Argentine Companies and El Paso\u2019s management of its investment, thus infringing Article II (2) (b) of the BIT. They were furthermore contrary to Articles II (2) (c) and XII, which require the host State to comply with all the obligations undertaken with regard to investments, including those related to tax matters. The measures taken were, moreover, tantamount to expropriation of El Paso\u2019s investment and its interest in the Argentine Companies, as well as of the latter\u2019s businesses, without ensuring prompt, adequate and effective compensation, contrary to Article IV. In addition, they were, according to the Claimant, contrary to the free transfer guarantee under Article V. Considering that the BIT was approved by a law of the Argentine Congress and pursuant to the Argentine Constitution, and hence forms part of the Respondent\u2019s domestic law, the measures taken in violation of the BIT are also contrary to the Argentine Constitution (*ibid.,*  \u00a7\u00a7 75-83).\n\n33.\n\nIn conclusion the Claimant asks the Tribunal for an award granting the following relief:\n\n\"A finding and declaration that the Republic has violated the BIT, international law and Argentine law;\n\nA finding and declaration that the governmental actions and omissions at issue are illegal, arbitrary, discriminatory, unfair, and inequitable; constitute an expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation; violate the obligation to allow the free transfer of funds without delay; and fail to comply with obligations undertaken towards the investment.\n\nAn award of damages to the Claimant for all damages caused to its investments, in an amount to be determined, including damages that continue to accrue, plus compound interest from the date of breach until actual payment at a rate to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal; and\n\nAn award to the Claimant of all costs of this proceeding, including their attorneys\u2019 fees.\"\n\n(Request for Arbitration, \u00a7 101)\n\n**3. The Jurisdictional Objections of Argentina**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe jurisdictional objections presented by the Respondent have changed in their presentation. In the table of content of the Memorial on Jurisdiction, the following objections were made:\n\n\"(A) The dispute submitted to the Tribunal does not meet the requirements set forth by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention to grant jurisdiction to ICSID and competence to the Tribunal;\n\n(B) Non-existence of a legal dispute;\n\n(C) The Claimant has no legitimate interest that authorizes it to file a claim with the ICSID;\n\n(D) The claim must be limited in respect to the tax measures.\"\n\n(Memorial on Jurisdiction p. 1)\n\nThen, when presenting the grounds for objection, Argentina objects to the jurisdiction of ICSID and to the competence of the present Tribunal on the following grounds:\n\n\"(A) The dispute submitted to the Tribunal does not meet the requirements set forth by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention to grant jurisdiction to ICSID and competence to the Tribunal;\n\n(B) The dispute submitted to the Tribunal does not constitute an \"investment dispute\" according to the provisions of Article VII. 1 of the BIT, since there is no evidence, even *prima facie,* of a violation of such Treaty;\n\n(C) The Claimant has no legitimate interest that authorizes to file a claim with the ICSID;\n\n(D) The claim must be limited in respect to the tax measures.\"\n\n(Memorial on Jurisdiction p. 12)\n\nThe Tribunal will deal with the different objections in the order it deems appropriate.\n\n**III. COMPETENCE OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**1. General Observations**\n---------------------------\n\n*a. Relevant Texts*\n-------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Center can only have jurisdiction if there is mutual consent. It is now established beyond doubt that a general reference to ICSID arbitration in a BIT can be considered as being the written consent of the State, required by Article 25 to give jurisdiction to the Centre, and that the filing of a request by the investor is considered to be the latter\u2019s consent.\n\n36.\n\nThe Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (hereafter: \"Washington Convention\" or \"ICSID Convention\") came into force for the United States on 14 October 1966; Argentina became a Party thereto on 18 November 1994. The BIT entered into force between the two States on 20 October 1994. Its Article VII (4) provides:\n\n\"Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:\n\n(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules...\"\n\nAnd, pursuant to paragraph 3(i) of the same Article, the \"national or company\" concerned, *i.e.* the Claimant, may fulfil that requirement by choosing\n\n\"to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration: (i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes...\"\n\nArgentina has given her consent by becoming a Party to the BIT when the latter entered into force on 20 October 1994 (Article VII (4)). El Paso, on 23 August 2002, delivered a letter to the Government notifying it of the dispute and seeking to resolve the matter by consultation and negotiation pursuant to Article VII (2) of the BIT, and informing it that El Paso would seek international arbitration if consultation and negotiation were to be unfruitful. The six-month period prescribed by Article VII (3) elapsed on 23 February 2003 (not 2002, as suggested at \u00a7 91 of the Request for Arbitration). On 5 June 2003, El Paso notified in writing the Federal Executive Branch of Argentina, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n,* as well as the Secretary-General of ICSID, of its acceptance of ICSID jurisdiction over the present dispute; and it did so again in its Request for Arbitration of 6 June 2003 (\u00a7 102). According to Rule 2(3) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, the latter date qualifies as the \"date of consent\". It will be noted, furthermore, that El Paso has not submitted the dispute to either Argentine courts or administrative tribunals, nor to any other previously agreed settlement procedure, which, according to the Claimant, means that the requirements of Article VII (3) (a) of the BIT have been met (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 84-91, 9899, 101-103).\n\n*b. Scope of Examination*\n-------------------------\n\n(i) Institution of Proceedings\n------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe BIT entered into force on 20 October 1994 (see above, \u00a7 36) and, accordingly, Argentina accepted ICSID arbitration on that same date. The Claimant did so by letters of 5 and 6 June 2003 to the Government and to the Secretary-General of ICSID. The Request for Arbitration was registered by the latter on 12 June 2003. The institution of proceedings therefore occurred on 12 June 2003, which accordingly becomes the relevant date for the institution of proceedings (Institution Rule 6 (2)).\n\n(ii) Prior Consultation and Negotiation\n---------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nUnder Article VII (2) of the BIT the parties to an investment dispute \"should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation\". That provision goes on to say that, \"if the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution\", *inter alia* to ICSID arbitration. This text could, in truth, raise a question of interpretation: is it mandatory, in order to resort to arbitration, to have consulted and negotiated? The conditional \"should\" in the first phrase of Article VII (2), chapeau, suggests that it is not. The second phrase, however, seems to view consultation and negotiation as a condition for submitting a case, a view shared by the Respondent. The question is moot in our case, however, as the Claimant has in effect attempted to consult and negotiate, as is shown by the facts related above (\u00a7 36).\n\n(iii) Significance of the Case-law Developed by the ICSID and Other Tribunals\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nICSID arbitral tribunals are established *ad hoc,* from case to case, in the framework of the Washington Convention, and the present Tribunal knows of no provision, either in that Convention or in the BIT, establishing an obligation of *stare decisis.* It is, nonetheless, a reasonable assumption that international arbitral tribunals, notably those established within the ICSID system, will generally take account of the precedents established by other arbitration organs, especially those set by other international tribunals. The present Tribunal will follow the same line, especially since both parties, in their written pleadings and oral arguments, have heavily relied on precedent.(iv) What Issues Are Deemed to Be of a Jurisdictional Nature?\n\n(iv) What Issues Are Deemed to Be of a Jurisdictional Nature?\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nAt this stage of the present proceedings, much turns around the question of which issues are of a jurisdictional character and which issues must be addressed at the stage of the merits. The question, therefore, deserves consideration.\n\n41.\n\nIn its pleadings and arguments, the Respondent has generally taken an extensive view of what belongs to the jurisdictional sphere. The Claimant, by contrast, has been restrictive in its views, often contending that this or that objection to jurisdiction, made by Argentina, belonged in fact to the merits of the case.\n\n42.\n\nIn the *Oil Platforms* case (Iran v. United States), jurisdiction, judgment of 12 December 1996 *(ICJ Reports* 1996, p. 803, \u00a7 16), the International Court of Justice (hereinafter \"ICJ\") defined its task at the jurisdictional level by pointing out that it\n\n\"must ascertain whether the violations... pleaded do or do not fall within the provisions of the [1955] Treaty [of Amity] and whether, as a consequence, the dispute is one which the Court has jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to entertain.\"\n\nIt is, in other words, a matter of whether the issues to be considered fall within the parameters of jurisdiction as defined by the enabling treaty. It is not one of examining whether the Claimant\u2019s allegations are well-founded on the merits.\n\n43.\n\nAs early as in *Amco* v. *Indonesia,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 25 September 1983 (ICSID case No. ARB 81/1, *ICSID Reports,* Vol. 1, p. 389, at p. 405), the ICSID Arbitral Tribunal dealing with the case had held that\n\n\"[t]he Tribunal must not attempt at this stage to examine the claim itself in any detail, but must only be satisfied that *prima facie* the claim, *as stated by the Claimant when initiating the arbitration,* is within the jurisdictional mandate of ICSID arbitration, and consequently of this Tribunal\" (emphasis added).\n\nHere again, the gist of the Tribunal\u2019s decision is that essentially the issue is not whether the claim is well-founded on the merits, but whether, in the way in which it is stated, it fits into the jurisdictional frame designed by the relevant treaty or treaties.\n\n44.\n\nThe question addressed here has also arisen in a recent case involving the Respondent. In *Siemens AG* v. *Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 3 August 2004 (ICSID case No. ARB/02/8, *ILM,* Vol. 44, 2005, p. 137), the Tribunal said (\u00a7 180):\n\n\"At this stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the claims under the Treaty [between Germany and Argentina Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investments of 9 April 1991] made by Siemens are correct. *This is a matter for the merits.* The Tribunal simply has to be satisfied that, *if the Claimant's allegations would be proven correct, then the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider them \"* (emphasis added).\n\n45.\n\nThis means that as long as they are not frivolous or abusive the claims made in the present case must be taken as they are by the Tribunal whose only task it is, in the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings, to determine if those claims, as formulated, fit into the jurisdictional frame drawn by the relevant treaty instrument or instruments. This is so because in that early phase, tribunals deal with the nature of claims or contentions and not with their well-foundedness. If it were otherwise, jurisdictional matters would have to be addressed at the same time as, or even subsequently to, the merits of the case. Accordingly, the question to be addressed here is whether the Claimant\u2019s allegations, if true - a problem to be examined at the merits stage -, denote violations of the BIT and therefore fall within this Tribunal\u2019s competence under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. This is the perspective from which Argentina\u2019s objections must be viewed. It is not open to the Tribunal, contrary to what was suggested by counsel for the Respondent (Transcription of Hearings, 8 April 2005, p. 55),\n\n\"to declare its jurisdiction conditionally expressing with particular emphasis the fact that the jurisdiction will apply in the event that the Claimant in the merits phase can prove the facts that clearly prove jurisdiction and competence of the Tribunal.\"\n\nRule 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules does not provide for deciding on a \"conditional\" jurisdiction of the Centre. All the Tribunal could do, under paragraph 4 of that Rule, is to join the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections to the merits. There is not, however, any cogent reason for such a joinder.\n\n46.\n\nThe Tribunal shall deal with the substance of these objections by examining the following four points: (i) Is the dispute of a \"legal\" nature?; (ii) Does it \"arise directly out of an investment\"?; (iii) Is the claim to be limited with regard to tax measures? (iv) Is there a legitimate legal interest justifying the filing of a claim with the ICSID?\n\n**2. First Issue: Is the Dispute of a \"Legal\" Nature?**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn fact, this preliminary objection which is in reality the first raised by the Respondent, presents different aspects. According to the Respondent, the dispute is not a legal one under the Washington Convention, for several reasons: first, the dispute is not about the determination of legal rights and duties; second, the dispute is purely contractual and commercial, because it only concerns rights and obligations based on agreements and contracts and merely is a dispute with respect to commercial flows; third, the existing contractual claims have not been transformed into treaty claims by the so-called \"umbrella clause\". The Tribunal will now examine these different contentions.\n\n48.\n\nThe first question to be addressed is whether legal rights or duties are involved in the dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent. According to the Respondent, the dispute, in order to come within the purview of ICSID jurisdiction as defined in Article 25 (1) of the Washington Convention, must be \"legal\" in nature: it has to relate to rights and duties, *i.e.* legal titles, not to \"certain undesirable consequences\" (Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 39). In this connexion, the Respondent cites a statement made by the President (recte: Vice-President) and General Counsel of the IBRD according to which the formula \"any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment\" found in Article 25 (1) was intended to encompass\n\n\"those cases involving differences of opinion with respect to a legal right. This would exclude cases like, for example, if a company wanted to challenge a system of price control, this implying issues of equity and not of legal rights.\"\n\nLater on the President added that \"legal disputes\" are those \"referring to a legal right or obligation, or referring to a fact related to the determination of such legal right or obligation\" *(ibid.,* \u00a7 40).\n\nAfter this general statement on the inexistence of a legal dispute, the Respondent becomes more specific. Argentina denies indeed any legal character to the present claim under Article 25 (1) of the 1965 Convention, stating that the dispute is not a legal one in the sense of the Convention because it is purely contractual in nature and, subsidiarily, that it is not a legal dispute as it raises only commercial issues.\n\n49.\n\nTo conclude that there is jurisdiction of the Centre and competence of this Tribunal, there must be, according to the Respondent, a dispute over the sense and scope of provisions falling within this Tribunal\u2019s competence. In the present case, the disagreements are, however, related to power generation and hydrocarbons concessions, exploration and production contracts, natural gas export permits and the Electric Power and Hydrocarbon Regulatory Frameworks. For the Respondent, these disagreements do not amount to a \"legal dispute\" under Article 25 (1) of the Washington Convention, because all the claims arise out of concessions and contracts and must therefore be submitted to the consented forum, the national courts of Argentina, as freely agreed upon by the parties, and not to an ICSID tribunal. The fact that the Claimant makes generic statements as to breaches by the Respondent of its BIT obligations is not sufficient to turn the claims into \"legal disputes\" under Article 25 (1).\n\n50.\n\nTo this line of argument, Argentina adds another, related consideration. Under the above treaty provision, disputes (or, rather, \"legal disputes\") \"are in relation to rights, not with respect to commercial flows\". Yet the Claimant focuses the disputes on commercial flows, *i.e.* on the freedom of exercising production and trading activities, rather than on assets owned or controlled by it. But under Article 1(1) (a) of the BIT, the latter conceives protected investments as consisting of rights *in personam* and *in rem,* as becomes evident from sub-paragraphs (i), (iv) and (v) of that provision: tangible and intangible ownership rights, intellectual property, and rights, licenses and permits granted pursuant to law. The issue \"is not what happened to such things, but what happened to the investor\u2019s rights on such things\", that is, what happened to them pursuant to the protection provided by the applicable legal system, which includes the BIT.\n\n51.\n\nAccordingly, the defendant State concludes that, assuming the existence of a dispute in the terms stated, that dispute pertains to the scope of obligations under the contracts and concessions referred to by the Claimant and that the dispute is purely commercial and therefore does not amount to violations by Argentina of rights specifically acknowledged in the BIT (Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 48-62).\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent cites two precedents which bar jurisdictional access to ICSID tribunals for purely contractual claims. In the first instance \u2014 *Generation Ukraine* v. *Ukraine* (Award of 16 September 2003, ICSID case No. ARB/00/9, *ILM,* Vol. 44, 2005, p. 404) \u2014 it was held that contractual claims could not fall within the competence of ICSID arbitration panels even when expropriation was alleged. In the event, the Tribunal found that governmental action or inaction, or maladministration, cannot be considered as expropriation, at least not without any previous attempt at correcting the administrative fault, *i.e.* at obtaining redress on the national level.\n\n53.\n\nIn *Waste Management II (Waste Management, Inc.* v. *Mexico),* Award of 30 April 2004 (ICSID case No. ARB (AF) 00/3), http://www.state.gov/documents/ organization/34643.pdf), the Tribunal held that breach of contract and expropriation were two different things: the former can be committed by anyone, while the latter is inherently governmental in character. In the first case, unless the breach is the result of governmental prerogative such as a legislative decree, the answer will be the filing of a complaint on the domestic level. Only when this has been done will the path be cleared for action on the international level.\n\n54.\n\nThis means, according to the Respondent, that the Claimant has only contractual claims, which are not protected by the BIT.\n\n55.\n\nThe reasoning followed by the Claimant is not altogether easy to describe, as arguments relating to the Second (absence of a legal dispute) and First Preliminary Objections (no dispute arising directly from an investment) - to refer to them in the order followed by the Respondent \u2014 are presented together. The Tribunal will attempt, at this stage, to limit itself to arguments related to the Second Preliminary Objection, which it has decided to address first (see paragraph 46).\n\n56.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, says the Claimant, the claims before the Tribunal do not meet the requirements of Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention because they fail to qualify as \"legal claims\", being contractual rights which do not amount to an \"investment\" under the BIT.\n\n57.\n\nRegarding the first, general part of the Respondent\u2019s argument, the Claimant recalls that a legal dispute is \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between parties\" (*East Timor* case, Portugal v. Australia, Jurisdiction, Judgment of 30 June 1995, *ICJ Reports* 1995, p. 89, at \u00a7 22). [This is, of course, not quite true since the definition just cited is that of a \"dispute\" *tout court rather than of a legal dispute.)* The Claimant, however, adds that a dispute is \u2018legal\u2019 if \"legal remedies such as restitution or damages are sought and if legal rights based on, for example, treaties or legislation are claimed.\" (Ch. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary,* Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001, p. 105) (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 28).\n\n58.\n\nThis is the case here, according to the Claimant, the fact that some of the claims involve contractual questions being irrelevant. The issue is whether the measures taken by Argentina were in violation of the latter\u2019s obligations under the BIT, including the question of whether those measures in effect amounted to the expropriation of specific legal and contractual rights and revenue, to unfair and inequitable treatment of the Claimant\u2019s investment, to unfair and discriminatory impairment of that investment, to a failure to provide full security and protection to the investment and to a violation of other rules of international law. The case also involves the amount of reparation due and, hence, clearly is a legal dispute. In this connexion, the Claimant invokes six precedents, all involving Argentina, among which *Azurix Corp.,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 December 2003 (ICSID case No. ARB/03/30, *ILM,* Vol. 43, 2004, p. 262, at \u00a7 58) and *LG&E* Decision on Jurisdiction of 30 April 2004, (ICSID case No. ARB/02/1, http://www.worldbank.org /icsid/cases/lge-decision-en.pdf). As was the case in these precedents, the Claimant has sufficiently demonstrated, in its Memorial, that measures taken by the Respondent adversely affected its \"legitimate legal and contract rights\". There is therefore a controversy over the existence and scope of legal rights or obligations and over the extent of the reparation due, which means that there is a \"legal dispute\" under Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 25-31).\n\n59.\n\nRegarding the Respondent\u2019s \"commercial-flows\" argument (see above, \u00a7 50), the Claimant replies that it has been amply shown in its Memorial that investments qualifying under the BIT were effected, and that the claims made are the result of measures taken by Argentina against those investments, consisting in shareholding interests in the Argentine Companies, capital contributions, legal and contractual rights under the Energy Regulatory Framework, concessions, oil, gas and energy supply agreements, and other legal rights *(ibid.,* \u00a7 20).\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Argentina that the nature of the dispute must be determined on objective grounds and not only on the basis of statements made by one or the other side. As pointed out by the ICJ in its Advisory Opinion of 30 March 1950 on the *Interpretation of Peace Treaties (ICJ Reports* 1950, p. 65, at p. 74), \"[w]hether there exists an international dispute is a matter for objective determination\". [It will be noted, in passing, that the Court\u2019s *dictum* pertains to the term \u2018international dispute\u2019 rather than the expression \u2018legal dispute.\u2019]\n\n61.\n\nFor this Tribunal, the notion of dispute generally has been accurately defined by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCIJ) in the *Mavrommatis* case (Greece v. Great Britain), Judgment of 30 August 1924, PCIJ, Series A, No. 2, where the Court said (p. 11) that \"[a] dispute is a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between two persons\". The above definition was recently confirmed by the ICJ in the *East Timor* case (see above, \u00a7 57, *ICJ Reports* 1995, p. 89, at \u00a7 22). It covers all \"disputes\", legal or political, national or international. \"Legal\" disputes have generally been defined as \"controversies in which the Parties are in disagreement over a right\". On the domestic level, this can be a disagreement over contractual or other rights. Regarding the international level, one may recall, for example, Article 1 of the 1925 Locarno Arbitration Conventions between Germany, on the one hand, and Belgium, France, Poland and Czechoslovakia, on the other hand (\"disputes with regard to which the parties are in conflict as to their respective rights\"). What matters here is whether the pretensions of the Claimant (and the arguments of the Respondent) are formulated as being based on terms of existing law. The answer is, in the words of the ICJ (see above, \u00a7 60), \"a matter for objective determination\".\n\n62.\n\nTo this Tribunal, it seems evident that the Claimant has formulated its pretensions in legal terms and on the basis of existing law; and that the Respondent has answered in terms of law. According to what was recalled above (\u00a7\u00a7 57-58), what matters at this stage, in order to determine if the dispute is a \"legal\" one pursuant to Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention, is whether the parties justify their claims by relying on law and whether legal remedies are being sought. Another question, to be decided at the merits stage, is whether those claims are well-founded in substance. This Tribunal finds that the present dispute is clearly of a legal character.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal will now deal with the second aspect of the Respondent\u2019s contention, to the effect that the claims do not amount to a legal dispute as they involve purely contractual and commercial rights. It is here that a series of questions arise regarding the nature of the rights allegedly violated. For the Respondent, these rights are purely contractual, based on domestic law, subject to domestic jurisdiction, and not protected by the BIT; accordingly, the measures taken by the Respondent would be directed exclusively at contractual rights. By contrast, the Claimant views them as investments, protected as such by the BIT.\n\n64.\n\nWhether the rights invoked do in fact exist, whether they are protected by international law, and whether they have effectively been violated are issues the determination of which must await the examination of the case on its merits. What matters at present is whether the claims, as formulated, fit into the categories of claims over which the ICSID has jurisdiction under the terms of the BIT and the Washington Convention. On the one hand, the Claimant contends that the measures taken by Argentina affected the direct or indirect ownership of shares and legal and contractual rights, that they afforded it a claim under the BIT and that the Claimant\u2019s rights qualify as \"investments\" under the broad provisions of the BIT. Hence, if there are any contractual claims in this specific case, they are also protected by the BIT, and in that sense the measures taken may amount to an expropriation of the Claimant\u2019s rights protected by that international instrument. In *Azurix* v. *Argentina* (above, \u00a7 58), the Tribunal held that a US company\u2019s indirect investment in a water concession in Argentina held through a local subsidiary was an \"investment\" in the sense of the BIT and that it had precisely been the intention of the Contracting Parties to cover that type of interests in order to protect the real party concerned. Accordingly, the Tribunal in *Azurix* concluded that the concession contract was an \"investment\" for the purpose of the BIT, given the wide meaning attributed to that term by the Treaty which includes \"any right conferred by law or contract\" (\u00a7\u00a7 64-66). In other words, the Claimant\u2019s rights cannot be downgraded to mere contractual rights, transforming the controversy into a contractual dispute removed from ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n65.\n\nIt is the Tribunal\u2019s view that it will not be enough to assert that a dispute is of a contractual nature to disqualify it as a legal dispute. It is well known that ICSID tribunals have been dealing over the years with contractual as well as non-contractual disputes. The question here is, rather, the extent of the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, which is based on a BIT and not on an arbitration clause in a contract. The Tribunal finds that, at first sight, it has jurisdiction over treaty claims and cannot entertain purely contractual claims which do not amount to claims for violations of the BIT.\n\n66.\n\nA last point to be examined here is whether the above view concerning the second aspect of the Preliminary Objection dealt with here has to be corrected on account of the presence of an \"umbrella clause\" in Article II(2)(c) of the BIT.\n\n67.\n\nConsidering that the Claimant\u2019s case comprises some claims which concern breaches of purported contractual relationships between the foreign investor and the Respondent - whose existence will be determined at the merits level -, the question for the Tribunal is whether Article II(2)(c) of the U.S.-Argentina BIT is an umbrella clause whose effect would be, according to the Claimants, to transform all contractual undertakings into international law obligations and, accordingly, to turn breaches of the slightest such obligations by the Respondent into breaches of the BIT.\n\n68.\n\nThis Tribunal wishes to state clearly at the outset the standards of interpretation of a BIT, which is an international treaty between two States whose purpose it is to protect the investments made by the nationals of each of the two States on the territory of the other, as this question has often been settled through different approaches. On the one hand, some contend that the treaty should be interpreted so as to favour State sovereignty; on the other, it has been argued that the interpretation should favour the investor\u2019s protection. An example of the first approach is the position adopted by the United States in the *Methanex* case. As stated by the UNCITRAL Tribunal in its First Partial Award on Jurisdiction dated 7 August 2002 (UNCITRAL Arbitration, www.state.gov/documents/organization/12613.pdf) :\n\n\"The USA contends that a doctrine of restrictive interpretation should be applied in investor-state disputes. In other words, wherever there is any ambiguity in clauses granting jurisdiction over disputes between states and private persons, such ambiguity is always to be resolved in favour of maintaining state sovereignty\" (\u00a7 103).\n\nThe Tribunal did not accept this approach. Conversely, investors often contend that, as a BIT\u2019S purpose is to protect them, the interpretation of treaties for the promotion and the protection of investments, viewed in their context and according to their object and purpose, leads to an interpretation in favour of the investors. For example, in the case just cited, the Tribunal underscored that \"[f]or Methanex, the phrase \u2018relating to\u2019 should be interpreted in the context of a treaty chapter concerned with the protection of investors; and hence, a broad interpretation is appropriate\" (\u00a7 137), a broad interpretation being here in favour of the investor, as it opens more broadly the possibilities to present an international claim. The Tribunal also rejected that broad interpretation, which imposed no limitation on the right of investors to sue the State. It stated that such an unbalanced interpretation cannot prevail, and adopted instead a balanced approach. In the Tribunal\u2019s own words, \"the provisions of Chapter 11 [of NAFTA] should be interpreted in good faith in accordance with their ordinary meaning (in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention), without any one-sided doctrinal advantage built into their text to disadvantage procedurally an investor seeking arbitral relief\u2019 (\u00a7 105).\n\n69.\n\nThe position as presented by Methanex, and more generally by investors, has sometimes been accepted by arbitral tribunals, such as the ICSID Tribunal in the case of *SGS* v. *Philippines,* Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 29 January, 2004 (ICSID case No. ARB/02/6, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/SGSvPhil-fmal.pdf), where it stated:\n\n\"The BIT is a treaty for the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments. According to the preamble it is intended \u2018to create and maintain favourable conditions for investments by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other\u2019. It is legitimate to resolve uncertainties in its interpretation so as to favour the protection of covered investments\" (\u00a7 116).\n\nOther Tribunals have rejected this approach, as a general approach. One may mention here the Tribunal in *Noble Ventures Inc.* v. *Romania* which declared that \"it is not *permissible, as is* too often done regarding BITs, to interpret clauses exclusively in favour of investors\" (Award of 12 October 2005, ICSID case No. ARB/01/11, http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Noble-Ventures-Final-Award.pdf, \u00a7 52, underlined in the Award), although it used this kind of interpretation in a specific instance.\n\n70.\n\nThis Tribunal considers that a balanced interpretation is needed, taking into account both State sovereignty and the State\u2019s responsibility to create an adapted and evolutionary framework for the development of economic activities, and the necessity to protect foreign investment and its continuing flow. It is bearing this in mind that the Tribunal will deal with the controversial question of the so-called \"umbrella clause\", which is still not moot: as stated recently by Emmanuel Gaillard, \"[t]his question has divided practitioners and legal commentators and remains unsettled in the international arbitral case law\", (*New York Law Journal,* Thursday, 6 October 2005). The question is whether, through an \"umbrella clause\", sometimes also called an \"observance-of-undertakings clause\", in a BIT, contractual claims of an investor having a contract either with the State or with an autonomous entity are automatically and *ipso jure* \"transformed\" into treaty claims benefiting from the dispute settlement mechanism provided for in the BIT. There is an ongoing debate on that question, as divergent positions have been adopted by different ICSID tribunals. Umbrella clauses are not always drafted in the same manner, and some decisions insist on the variations in the drafting to explain different analyses. This Tribunal is not convinced that the clauses analysed so far really should receive different interpretations. The broadest clauses read like that contained in the relevant clause of Article II(2)(c) in the U.S-Argentina BIT, which provides that:\n\n\"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"\n\n71.\n\nThe first tribunal to be faced with the interpretation of such a clause on the availability of international arbitration based on a BIT for purely contractual claims was the Tribunal, presided by Judge Feliciano, in *SGS* v. *Pakistan',* in the Tribunal\u2019s own words, \"[i]t appears that this is the first international arbitral tribunal that has had to examine the legal effect of a clause such as Article 11 of the BIT. We have not been directed to the award of any ICSID or other tribunal in this regard, and so it appears we have here a case of first impression.\" (SGS. *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A.* v. *Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 August, 2003, \u00a7 164). Indeed, the \"umbrella clause\" in the Swiss-Pakistan BIT was its Article 11, which stated:\n\n\"Either Contracting Party shall constantly guarantee the observance of the commitments it has entered into with respect to the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\nThe Tribunal did not consider, as is well known, that this clause \"elevates\" all contract claims stemming from a contract with the State to the level of claims for a breach of the Treaty, in other words that it transforms any contract claim into a treaty claim. The arguments put forward by the Tribunal are, in the view of this Tribunal, more than conclusive. These arguments can be summarised in the following manner.\n\n72.\n\nFirstly, Article 11 refers to commitments in general, not only to contractual commitments. Therefore, if one considers that it elevates contract claims to the status of treaty claims, it should result as an unavoidable consequence that all claims based on any commitment in legislative or administrative or other unilateral acts of the State or one of its entities or subdivisions are to be considered as treaty claims:\n\n\"The \u2018commitments\u2019 the observance of which a Contracting Party is to \u2018constantly guarantee\u2019 are not limited to *contractual* commitments. The commitments referred to may be embedded in, *e.g.,* the municipal legislative or administrative or other unilateral measures of a Contracting Party. The phrase \u2018constantly [to] guarantee the observance' of some statutory, administrative or contractual commitment simply does not, to our mind, necessarily signal the creation and acceptance of a new international law obligation on the part of the Contracting Party, where clearly there was none before. Further, the \u2018commitments\u2019 subject matter of Article 11 may, without imposing excessive violence on the text itself, be commitments of the State itself as a legal person, or of any office, entity or subdivision (local government units) or legal representative thereof whose acts are, under the law on state responsibility, attributable to the State itself. As a matter of textuality therefore, the scope of Article 11 of the BIT, while consisting in its entirety of only one sentence, *appears susceptible of almost indefinite expansion\"* (Decision, \u00a7 166; emphasis by this Tribunal).\n\n73.\n\nSecondly, and consequently, if any violation of any commitment of the State is a violation of the Treaty, this renders useless all substantive standards of protection of the Treaty:\n\n\"[T]he Claimant\u2019s view of Article 11 tends to make Articles 3 to 7 of the BIT substantially superfluous. There would be no real need to demonstrate a violation of those substantive treaty standards if a simple breach of contract, or of municipal statute or regulation, by itself, would suffice to constitute a treaty violation on the part of a Contracting Party and engage the international responsibility of the Party\" (Decision, \u00a7 168.).\n\n74.\n\nA last point to be made, however, which brings some nuances to its findings in the *SGS v. Pakistan* case, is that the Tribunal does not exclude the possibility that States decide to consider, in a BIT, that the slightest violation of a contract between a State and a foreign investor amounts to a violation of the Treaty, but then this has to be stated clearly and unambiguously:\n\n\"The Tribunal is not saying that States may not agree with each other in a BIT that henceforth, all breaches of each State\u2019s contracts with investors of the other State are forthwith converted into and to be treated as breaches of the BIT. What the Tribunal is stressing is that in this case, there is no clear and persuasive evidence that such was in fact the intention of both Switzerland and Pakistan in adopting Article 11 of the BIT\" (Decision, \u00a7 173).\n\nThis general reasoning is quite convincing, keeping in mind that the words \"contract\" or \"contractual obligations\" do not even appear in the so-called umbrella clause.\n\n75.\n\nAs is also well known, this analysis was strongly criticised by another ICSID Tribunal, presided by Dr. El-Kosheri, in a similar case, *SGS* v. *Philippines,* in its 2004 Decision on Jurisdiction (above, \u00a7 69), in which it had to deal with an \"umbrella clause\" embodied in Article X(2) of the BIT:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it has assumed with regard to specific investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\nHere too, it seems useful to this Tribunal to summarise the main steps of the reasoning followed. First, the Tribunal in *SGS* v. *Philippines* indeed considered that this general provision transformed any contractual obligation of the State into a treaty obligation:\n\n\"It uses the mandatory term \u2018shall\u2019 in the same way as substantive Articles III-VI. The term \u2018any obligation\u2019 is capable of applying to obligations arising under national law, e.g., those arising from a contract... Interpreting the actual text of Article X(2), it would appear to say, and to say clearly, that each Contracting Party shall observe *any legal obligation* it has assumed, or will in the future assume, with regard to specific investments covered by the BIT (Decision, \u00a7 115, emphasis by this Tribunal).\"\n\nSecond, after having underscored the difference in the language of the umbrella clauses in *SGS* v. *Pakistan* and *SGS* v *Philippines,* the Tribunal criticised the reasoning of its predecessor and mainly emphasised that if it does not elevate the contract claims into treaty claims the umbrella clause has no real far-reaching meaning.\n\n76.\n\nThis Tribunal should like to stress, on the contrary, that the interpretation given in *SGS v. Philippines* does not only deprive one single provision of far-reaching consequences but renders the whole Treaty completely useless : indeed, if this interpretation were to be followed - the violation of *any legal obligation* of a State, and not only of any contractual obligation with respect to investment, is a violation of the BIT, whatever the source of the obligation and whatever the seriousness of the breach - it would be sufficient to include a so-called \"umbrella clause\" and a dispute settlement mechanism, and no other articles setting standards for the protection of foreign investments in any BIT. If any violation of any legal obligation of a State is *ipso facto* a violation of the treaty, then that violation needs not amount to a violation of the high standards of the treaty of \"fair and equitable treatment\" or \"full protection and security\". Apart from this general and very important remark, the Tribunal also wishes to point to the fact that quite contradictory conclusions have been drawn by the Tribunal in *SGS* v. *Philippines',* among other things, the Tribunal stated that, although the umbrella clause transforms the contract claims into treaty claims, first \"it does not convert the issue of the *extent* or *content* of such obligations into an issue of international law\" (Decision, \u00a7 128, original emphasis), which means that the \"contract claims/treaty claims\" should be assessed according to the national law of the contract and not the treaty standards, and, second, that the umbrella clause does not \"override specific and exclusive dispute settlement arrangements made in the investment contract itself\u2019 (Decision, \u00a7 134), which explains that the Tribunal has suspended its proceedings until the \"contract claims/treaty claims would be decided by the national courts in accordance with the dispute settlement provisions of the contract\", stating that \" the Tribunal should not exercise its jurisdiction over a contractual claim when the parties have already agreed on how such a claim is to be resolved, and have done so exclusively\"(Decision, \u00a7 155). In other words, the Tribunal asserts that a treaty claim should not be analysed according to treaty standards, which seems quite strange, and that it has jurisdiction over the contract claims/treaty claims, but at the same time that it does not really have such jurisdiction - until the contract claims are decided. This controversy has been going on ever since these two contradictory decisions.\n\n77.\n\nSome have adopted the *SGS v. Philippines* position but not drawn the same consequences from it. Thus, in *Eureko B. V.* v. *Poland* (Partial Award of 19 August, 2005), the Tribunal, presided by Mr. Yves Fortier, accepted the idea that, as a result of the umbrella clause in the BIT - Article 3(5) of the BIT provided that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investors of the other Contracting Party\" \u2014, the smallest obligation of a State with regard to investments was protected by the BIT and could give rise to an ICSID obligation. This decision was, however, accompanied by a strong dissent of the arbitrator Rajski, who emphasised the systemic consequences a broad interpretation of so-called \"umbrella clauses\" could entail:\n\n\"It is worth to note that by opening a wide door to foreign parties to commercial contracts concluded with a State owned company to switch their contractual disputes from normal jurisdiction of international commercial arbitration tribunals or state courts to BIT Tribunals, the majority of this Tribunal has created a potentially dangerous precedent capable of producing negative effects on the further development of foreign capital participation in privatizations of State owned companies\" (Dissenting Opinion, \u00a7 11).\n\nIn *Noble Ventures Inc.* v. *Romania* (above, \u00a7 69), the Tribunal, presided by Professor B\u00f4ckstiegel, followed the same line of reasoning, stating quite generally that \"[a]n umbrella clause is usually seen as transforming municipal law obligations into obligations directly cognizable in international law\" (Award, \u00a7 53). The Tribunal, while it considered the umbrella clause as an exception to the \"well established rule of general international law that in normal circumstances *per se* a breach of a contract by the State does not give rise to direct international responsibility on the part of the State\", certainly did not interpret that exception restrictively, as exceptions should be interpreted, although it mentioned the necessity theoretically to adopt such an interpretation when it stated : \"as with any other exception to established general rules of law, the identification of a provision as an umbrella clause can as a consequence proceed only from a strict, if not indeed restrictive, interpretation of its terms\" (Decision, \u00a7 55). In the words used by the Tribunal in *Noble Ventures Inc.* v. *Romania,* the breach of a contract being assimilated by the umbrella clause to a breach of the BIT, is thus \"internationalized\" (Decision, \u00a7 54). Again, the problem faced by such reasoning, according to this Tribunal, is that, by necessary implication, *all municipal law commitments* must necessarily be as well *'Internationalised',* as the so-called umbrella clause does not differentiate among obligations; it refers to *any* obligation and not specifically to *contractual* obligations, the consequence being that the division between the national legal order and the international legal order is completely blurred. One of the arguments presented by the ICSID Tribunal in *Noble Ventures* was that the \"elevation\" theory was prompted by the object and purpose of the BIT, and that \"[a]n interpretation to the contrary would deprive the investor of any internationally secured legal remedy in respect of investment contracts that it has entered into with the host State\" (Decision, \u00a7 52). In this Tribunal\u2019s opinion, this is not a good reason, and it can explain why. Either the foreign investor has a commercial contract with an autonomous State entity or it has an investment agreement with the State, in which some \"clauses exorbitantes du droit commun\" are inserted. In both cases, it is more than likely that the foreign investor will have managed to insert a dispute settlement mechanism into the contract; usually, in a purely commercial contract, that mechanism will be commercial arbitration or the national courts, while in an investment agreement it will generally be an international arbitration mechanism such as that of ICSID. In other words, in the so-called State contracts, there is usually an \"internationally secured legal remedy\", while in the mere commercial contracts governed by national law, there is no reason why such a mechanism should be available, as stated by Judge Schwebel, when he said that \"it is generally accepted that, so long as it affords remedies in its Courts, a State is only directly responsible, on the international plane, for acts involving breaches of contract, where the breach is not a simple breach... but involves an obviously arbitrary or tortious element...\" (*International Arbitration : Three Salient Problems,* Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1987, p. 111).\n\n78.\n\nSome have adopted the *SGS v. Pakistan* position, either by insisting on certain specificities of the case, or by presenting a general approach. In *Salini* v. *Jordan,* decided in 2004 (*Salini Costruttori S.p.A. & Italstrade S.p.A,* v. *Hachemite Kingdom of Jordan,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 November 2004, ICSID case No. ARB/02/13, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/salini-decision.pdf). the Tribunal, presided by Judge Gilbert Guillaume, answered in the negative the question of the \"elevation\" of contract claims into treaty claims, insisting on the generality of the language used in the so-called umbrella clause in Article 2(4)1, which stated that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall create and maintain in its territory a legal framework apt to guarantee the investors the continuity of legal treatment, including the compliance, in good faith, of all undertakings assumed with regard to each specific investor\". In *Joy Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* (Award of 6 August 2004, ICSID case No. ARB/02/11, http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/joy-mining-award.pdf), the Tribunal, presided by Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, noted that a discussion of the \"umbrella clause\" was not necessary for the outcome of the case but, in order to \"make certain clarifications\", took a firm position against the transformation of all contractual claims into treaty claims in the specific case:\n\n\"In this context, it could not be held that an umbrella clause inserted in the Treaty, and not very prominently, could have the effect of transforming all contract disputes into investment disputes under the Treaty, unless of course there would be a clear violation of the Treaty rights and obligations or a violation of contract rights of such a magnitude as to trigger the Treaty protection\" (\u00a781).\n\n\"The Tribunal notes that Article 2(4) of the BIT between Italy and Jordan is couched in terms that are appreciably different from the provisions applied in the arbitral decisions and awards cited by the Parties\" (Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 126).\n\n79.\n\nIn this Tribunal\u2019s view, it is necessary to distinguish the State as a merchant from the State as a sovereign. This is not new: in the above case of *Joy Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* the ICSID Tribunal stated: \"A basic general distinction can be made between commercial aspects of a dispute and other aspects involving the existence of some forms of State interference with the operation of the contract involved\" (Decision, \u00a7 72). The same approach was taken by the *ad hoc* Committee on annulment presided by Mr. Yves Fortier in the *Vivendi II* case, where the distinction between contract claims and treaty claims was clearly stated:\n\n\"whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law \u2014 in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract, by the proper law of the contract, in other words, the law of Tucum\u00e1n. For example, in the case of a claim based on a treaty, international law rules of attribution apply, with the result that the state of Argentina is internationally responsible for the acts of its provincial authorities. By contrast, the state of Argentina is not liable for the performance of contracts entered into by Tucum\u00e1n, which possesses separate legal personality under its own law and is responsible for the performance of its own contracts\" *(Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. et Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux (Vivendi Universal) v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Annulment of 3 July 2002, *ILM,* Vol. 41, 2002, p. 1135, \u00a7 96).\n\n80.\n\nThe view that it is essentially from the State as a sovereign that the foreign investors have to be protected through the availability of international arbitration is confirmed, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, by the language in the new 2004 US Model BIT, which clearly elevates only the contract claims stemming from an investment agreement *stricto sensu,* that, is an agreement in which the State appears as a sovereign, and not all contracts signed with the State or one of its entities to the level of treaty claims, as results from its Article 24(1)(a).\n\n81.\n\nIn view of the necessity to distinguish the State as a merchant, especially when it acts through instrumentalities, from the State as a sovereign, the Tribunal considers that the \"umbrella clause\" in the Argentine-US BIT, which prescribes that \"[e]ach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\", can be interpreted in the light of Article VII (1), which clearly includes among the investment disputes under the Treaty all disputes resulting from a violation of a commitment given by the State as a sovereign State, either through an agreement, an authorisation, or the BIT :\n\n\"an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Parties foreign investment authority (if any such authorization exists); or, (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred and created by this Treaty with respect to an investment\".\n\nInterpreted in this way, the umbrella clause in Article II of the BIT, read in conjunction with Article VII, will not extend the Treaty protection to breaches of an ordinary commercial contract entered into by the State or a State-owned entity, but will cover additional investment protections contractually agreed by the State as a sovereign \u2014 such as a stabilization clause - inserted in an investment agreement.\n\n82.\n\nIn conclusion, in this Tribunal\u2019s view, following the important precedents set by Tribunals presided over by Judge Feliciano, Judge Guillaume and Professor Orrego Vicu\u00f1a, an umbrella clause cannot transform any contract claim into a treaty claim, as this would necessarily imply that any commitments of the State in respect to investments, even the most minor ones, would be transformed into treaty claims. These far-reaching consequences of a broad interpretation of the so-called umbrella clauses, quite destructive of the distinction between national legal orders and the international legal order, have been well understood and clearly explained by the first Tribunal which dealt with the issue of the so-called \"umbrella clause\" in the *SGS* v. *Pakistan* case and which insisted on the theoretical problems faced. It would be strange indeed if the acceptance of a BIT entailed an international liability of the State going far beyond the obligation to respect the standards of protection of foreign investments embodied in the Treaty and rendered it liable for any violation of any commitment in national or international law \"with regard to investments\". A well-known specialist of ICSID, Christoph Schreuer, has strikingly described what some of the practical consequences of a broad interpretation of the umbrella clauses could be:\n\n\"Problems could... arise if investors were to start using umbrella clauses for trivial disputes. It cannot be the function of an umbrella clause to turn every minor disagreement on a detail of a contract performance into an issue for which international arbitration is available *[but, in the view of this Tribunal, this is possible with a broad interpretation of the* *umbrella clause).* For example, a small delay in a payment due to the investor and interest accruing from the delay would hardly justify arbitration under a BIT *[but, in the view of this Tribunal, nothing could prevent such an arbitration, if a broad interpretation of the umbrella clause is accepted].* Equally a lease dispute with the host State that is peripherical to the investment will not be an appropriate basis for the institution of arbitral proceedings *[but, in the view of this Tribunal, the institution of such proceedings is possible with a broad interpretation of the umbrella clause].* It is to be hoped that investors will invoke the umbrella clauses with appropriate restraint\"(\"Travelling the BIT Route. Of Waiting Periods, Umbrella Clauses and Forks in the Road\", *Journal of World Investment & Trade,* Vol. 5, 2004, p. 255).\n\nIt is the firm conviction of this Tribunal that the investors will not use appropriate restraint \u2014 and why should they?-- if the ICSID tribunals offer them unexpected remedies. The responsibility for showing appropriate restraint rests rather in the hands of the ICSID tribunals.\n\n83.\n\nHow does this apply to the present case? Both parties have discussed the so-called umbrella clause included in Article II(2)(c) of the U.S.-Argentina BIT which, as mentioned earlier, provides that:\n\n\"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"\n\nThe positions of the parties are contradictory as far as the interpretation of the so-called umbrella clause is concerned. On the one hand:\n\n\"the Argentine Republic states that the best interpretation of contractual claims under the BIT with umbrella clauses is the interpretation made by the Tribunal in *SGS* v. *Pakistan,* which upheld several reasons according to which contractual claims cannot be submitted to international arbitration\" (Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 71).\n\nOn the other hand, the Claimant considers that:\n\n\"[t]his provision puts contracts between the host State and the investor as well as other commitments undertaken by the host State under the protection of the U.S.-Argentina BIT. It adds to the U.S.-Argentina BIT\u2019s substantive standards the observance of contracts or other obligations the host State has entered into with regard to specific investments. It follows that a breach of such a contract is in violation of Article II(2)(c) of the U.S.-Argentina BIT\" (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 83).\n\n84.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, this umbrella clause does not extend its jurisdiction over any contract claims that the Claimants might present as stemming solely from the breach of a contract between the investor and the Argentine State or an Argentine autonomous State entity. Moreover, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is especially clear that the umbrella clause does not extend to any contract claims when such claims do not rely on a violation of the standards of protection of the BIT, namely, national treatment, MFN clause, fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, protection against arbitrary and discriminatory measures, protection against expropriation or nationalisation either directly or indirectly, unless some requirements are respected. However, there is no doubt that if the State interferes with contractual rights by a unilateral act, whether these rights stem from a contract entered into by a foreign investor with a private party, a State autonomous entity or the State itself, in such a way that the State\u2019s action can be analysed as a violation of the standards of protection embodied in a BIT, the treaty-based arbitration tribunal has jurisdiction over all the claims of the foreign investor, including the claims arising from a violation of its contractual rights. Moreover, Article II, read in conjunction with Article VII(1), also considers as treaty claims the breaches of an investment agreement between Argentina and a national or company of the United States.\n\n85.\n\nIn other words, the Tribunal, endorsing the interpretation first given to the so-called \"umbrella clause\" in the Decision *SGS v. Pakistan,* confirms what it mentioned above (\u00a7 65), namely, that it has jurisdiction over treaty claims and cannot entertain purely contractual claims, which do not amount to a violation of the standards of protection of the BIT. It adds that, in view of Article VII(1) of the US-Argentina BIT, a violation of an investment agreement entered into by the State as a sovereign and a national or company of the United States is deemed to be also a violation of the Treaty and can thus give rise to a treaty claim.\n\n86.\n\nThe answer to the question raised above (\u00a7 66), that is, whether the existence of a so-called umbrella clause changes the Tribunals intermediary conclusion to the effect that it has no jurisdiction over purely contractual claims, and that it can only entertain treaty claims, is clearly in the negative. Indeed, the Tribunal has jurisdiction only over the treaty claims, the latter including, pursuant to the wording of Article VII(1), the claims based on the violation of an investment agreement entered into by the foreign investor with the State as a sovereign.\n\n87.\n\nThe distribution of the numerous claims of the Claimant between the two categories - purely contractual claims which are outside the competence of the Tribunal, and contractual claims which amount to treaty claims which are within that jurisdiction - will naturally be decided when dealing with the merits, but it was necessary for the Tribunal to ascertain the theoretical scope of its competence at the jurisdictional phase.\n\n88.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Tribunal finds that the dispute submitted to it is of a \"legal\" character under Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, it rejects the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection based on the absence of a legal claim.\n\n**3. Second Issue: Does the Dispute Arise Directly Out of an Investment?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, contrary to Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention, which requires a dispute to arise \"directly out of an investment\", this requirement being a jurisdictional one, the present claims do not fulfil that condition. To bolster its objection, Argentina invokes the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of Article 25 (1), which initially was intended to refer to \"disputes arising *out of or in relation to* an investment\" (emphasis added), a very wide formula that was subsequently reduced to the present language. The current text was approved with the evident objective of limiting the types of disputes falling under ICSID jurisdiction (Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 13-16).\n\n90.\n\nEven assuming that the Claimant has provided evidence of its investment - the Respondent continues - none of the issues submitted \"arises directly out of the investment\" as required by Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention. More precisely, the alleged infringements of the BIT must be \"directly\", *i.e.* \"specifically\" aimed at the investment. Universal measures directed at everybody cannot be considered by ICSID tribunals, for if they could, these tribunals would be judging public policy rather than legal conflicts. Even at the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant must prove that the cause of the alleged prejudice is legal and not only factual in character.\n\n91.\n\nIt is true that general measures can, exceptionally, justify ICSID jurisdiction, but only when \"those measures are adopted in violation of specific commitments given to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts\", as the Arbitral Tribunal said in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of 17 July 2003 in *CMS Gas Transmission Co.* v. *Argentina* (ICSID case No. ARB/01/8, *ILM,* Vol. 42, 2003, p. 788). \"What is brought under the jurisdiction of the Centre\", the Tribunal continues, \"is not the general measures in themselves but the extent to which they may violate those specific commitments\" (\u00a7 27). According to Argentina, a \"clear and reasonable interpretative line\" on this would be that the Claimant must show specific commitments made to it, negotiated with it and \"promised particularly, specifically and exclusively\" to it. Such is not the case when the rights involved were contractual ones, held by a claimant as indirect foreign minority shareholder in local companies (Transcription of Hearings, 8 April 2005, pp. 18, 25). The Claimant must also show, at this early stage of the proceedings, that those specific commitments, specifically undertaken by Argentina, were violated by the latter\u2019s measures: devaluation of the peso, establishment of a new exchange parity, temporary conversion of obligations and tariffs into pesos, imposition of a new fiscal policy (Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a717-25).\n\n92.\n\nThe Respondent then turns to *Methanex* v. *United States,* (First Partial Award of 7 August 2002, above, \u00a7 68), where a NAFTA rule similar to that of Article 25 (1) of the 1965 Washington Convention was discussed, namely Article 1101 of NAFTA relating to protection against \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to (a) investors of another Party... (b) investments of investors of another Party, in the territory of a Party\". As none of the measures taken by the defendant, the US, was expressly aimed at Methanex, the question was whether those measures were \"related to\" that company and, in particular, whether it was sufficient that they were susceptible of affecting the Claimant. On the last point, the Tribunal in its Partial Award, reached the conclusion that there had to be a significant threshold to NAFTA arbitration and that the criterion of any economic impact on the investor did not provide such a threshold. In other words, and to quote Argentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction (\u00a7 36), \"[s]imple affectation does not mean that there has been a legal affectation\". The Claimant should have proved a direct, proximate and immediate connexion between the measure and [the Claimant\u2019s] alleged investment (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 2638; see also Transcription of Hearings, 8 April 2005, p. 10).\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimant replies, firstly, that it did indeed make investments under the BIT consisting of shareholding interests in the Argentine Companies, capital contributions, legal and contractual rights under the Energy Regulatory Framework, concessions, private oil, gas and energy supply agreements, and other legal rights. These qualify as investments under the BIT, and the present claims are the consequence of measures taken by Argentina against those investments. The present dispute is an investment dispute within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 35).\n\n94.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Argentina misinterprets the *Methanex* decision (above, \u00a7 68). when it contends that that decision stands for the proposition that a \"general measure must be directed against specific commitments undertaken before the investor\" and that the Claimant must establish \"a direct, proximate and immediate connection between the measure and its alleged investment\" (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 51). The Claimant points out: (i) that the *Methanex* decision does not pertain to matters covered by the BIT; and (ii) that it actually supports the Claimant\u2019s views.\n\n95.\n\nThe Claimant might have found itself in a situation similar to that of Methanex, had it been a supplier, like the latter. But in the present case, the Respondent\u2019s measures have been aimed directly at the electricity and oil industries, including the Claimant\u2019s investment in the Argentine Companies, unlike what had happened in *Methanex* where the relevant California Executive Order did not even mention \"methanol\". By contrast, in the instant case, the Government issued orders which: (i) froze electricity prices; (ii) altered the spot-price setting mechanism; (iii) abolished both the concept of spot price *per se* and the uniformity of the spot price for all generators in the spot market; (iv) substantially reduced capacity payments; (v) pesified capacity payments at artificial and depressed rates of exchange; (vi) imposed caps on spot prices; (vii) imposed a ranking on the payment of energy sales; (viii) imposed withholdings on oil exports to compensate the banks for the impact suffered as a result of the asymmetrical pesification implemented in January 2002; and (ix) imposed restrictions on hydrocarbon exports.\n\n96.\n\nFurthermore, in the *Methanex* case, the United States objected to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under Article 1001 of NAFTA, alleging that the measures taken by the State of California were not \"related to\" Methanex\u2019s investment. The Tribunal in that case saw a \"relation\" between a measure and an investment where there was a \"legally significant connexion\" between the former and the latter. The (Canadian) Claimant tried to prove such a connexion by alleging collusion between lobbyists of the (American) methanol industry and the Governor of California. The Tribunal concluded that the evidence tendered by the Claimant was insufficient; it did not, however, refuse to take jurisdiction but asked the Claimant to provide additional evidence. In the present instance, according to the Claimant, the relation between the investments and the measures complained of is a straightforward one: the latter were measures specifically aimed at the oil and gas industry; and, contrary to *Methanex,* the evidence in the case points to a clear \"legally significant connexion\" between Argentina\u2019s measures, the BIT and the Claimant\u2019s investments in the Argentine Companies.\n\n97.\n\nIn this Tribunal\u2019s view, general measures of economic policy taken by a host State are not within the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals. In that sense, and even conceding that the legal context of the instant case differs from that of *Methanex,* it cannot be denied that such general measures do often not result in a dispute \"arising directly out of an investment\" in the sense of Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention. It may well be, however, that in the context of the commitments assumed by the host State, \"general\" measures have a \"specific\" effect in that they violate specific commitments. The expression \"a dispute arising directly out of an investment\" (Article 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention) cannot, therefore, be interpreted as meaning that the dispute can only result from a measure \"directed to\" the investment. The adverb \"directly\" is not related to the link between the measure and the investment but to that between the dispute and the investment.\n\n98.\n\nIn *CMS* (above, \u00a7 91), invoked by both parties, the Tribunal before which the case had been brought found that it was competent\n\n\"to examine whether specific measures affecting the Claimant\u2019s investment or general measures of economic policy having a direct bearing on such investment have been adopted in violation of legally binding commitments made to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts\" (\u00a733).\n\n99.\n\nIn other words, the link required between the measure and the investment cannot be gauged simply by asserting that the measures taken are \"general\" or that the State\u2019s commitments are not \"specific\". Such measures, though \"general\" in appearance, may have highly specific effects, *e.g.,* the destruction of an investment through expropriation, as in *GAMI v. Mexico* (UNCITRAL arbitration, *ILM,* Vol. 44, 2005, p. 545).\n\n100.\n\nThus the Tribunal finds that the present dispute has arisen directly out of an investment in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and, accordingly, rejects Argentina\u2019s Preliminary Objection based on the fact that the dispute did not arise directly out of an investment.\n\n**4. Third Issue: Does the Present Claim Have to Be Limited with Respect to Tax Measures?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nArticle XII of the BIT provides:\n\n\"1. With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the other Party.\n\n2. Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Articles VII and VIII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article IV;\n\n(b) transfers, pursuant to Article V; or\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VII (1) (a) or (b),\n\nto the extent they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable period of time.\"\n\n102.\n\nFor the Respondent, this provision limits the scope of the protection granted by the BIT in tax matters in two ways. First, under paragraph 1, the standard of fairness and equity in the treatment of investments established by Article II (2) (a) of the BIT is restricted by using the formula \"each Party should strive to accord\". This \"modified\" or \"softened\" duty of fair and equitable treatment in the field of taxation excludes recourse to the Treaty\u2019s dispute settlement system in tax matters, unless the taxation measure complained of: (i) amounts to expropriation; (ii) pertains to transfers related to an investment under Article V; or (iii) concerns the observance and enforcement of investment agreements or authorisations under Article VII (1) (a) or (b).\n\n103.\n\nNext Argentina notes that the Claimant has conceded that its claim, specifically inasmuch as it concerns rights to export hydrocarbons, relates to tax matters and, accordingly, is outside the limits set by Article XII of the BIT. On the one hand, the duty to grant fairness and equity alleged by the Claimant to have been violated is limited to \"striving\" and, accordingly, is not justiciable. On the other hand, the only claims that may be considered by the Tribunal, under paragraph 2 of Article XII, are those based on expropriation under Article IV of the BIT, on transfers pursuant to Article V, or on the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorisation as referred to in Article VII (1) (a) or (b). Everything else is beyond the competence of the Tribunal (Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 94-102).\n\n104.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (\u00a7\u00a7 117-135) and its oral argument (Transcription of Hearings, 8 April 2005, pp. 103-107), the Claimant lengthily rebuts these arguments. It begins by noting that the Respondent fails to appreciate that the claim regarding export withholdings in fact concerns the expropriation of investments by Argentina, the compliance of that State with investment agreements and authorisations (such as the concessions) and, generally, the unfair and inequitable treatment of the Claimant\u2019s investment (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 119).\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimant then points out that the present objection is one of inadmissibility and, as such, does not form part of the jurisdictional enquiry at this stage of the case. Moreover, Argentina\u2019s decision to impose export withholdings, by itself or in conjunction with other measures, may be \"tantamount to expropriation\" (Article IV (1) of the BIT). In addition, the claims made are not limited to a tax-related dispute (*ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 120-121).\n\n106.\n\nIt is not true, according to the Claimant, that Article XII (1) eliminates the standard of \"fair and equitable treatment\". The commitment to strive is not the meaningless reference Argentina sees in it. This assertion is buttressed by a reference to *Occidental Exploration and Production Co. v. Ecuador,* UNCITRAL arbitration, Final Award of 1 July 2004 (LCIA case No. UN 3467, http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Occidental-Ecuador-FinalAward-IJul2004.pdf). where the Tribunal said, with reference to Article X (1) of the US-Ecuador BIT, similar to Article XII (1) of the Argentina-US BIT relevant here, that that provision\n\n\"is not devoid of legal significance. It imposes an obligation on the host State that is not different from the obligation of fair and equitable treatment embodied in Article II [which is the same as Article II of the present BIT], even though admittedly the language of Article X is less mandatory\" (\u00a7 70).\n\nThe Claimant thus contends that the obligation enshrined in Article XII is enforceable, as is the duty to negotiate in good faith, and that the Respondent failed to discharge it by violating various commitments such as the express undertaking to abstain from levying export withholdings and by forcing CAPSA and CAPEX to sell their crude oil to local refiners at rates below the market price through threats such as that of further increases of the export withholdings, thus denying fair and equitable treatment to the Claimant\u2019s investments. In addition, the treatment of the Claimant, of CAPSA and of CAPEX was discriminatory in that the withholdings were earmarked for compensating the losses suffered by the banking sector on account of other Government measures and in that these taxes were targeted to the specific nature of the business pursued by the Claimant, despite the exclusion by the Hydrocarbon Regulatory Framework and the concessions of any \"existing or future fees, duties and withholdings\" and despite the prohibition of taxes other than royalties on the production of liquid hydrocarbons. What is more, the \"soft\" standard of Article XII (1) does not deprive the Claimant of its right to bring a claim. This flows from Article XII (2), taken together with Article IV, since what is at stake is an investment pursuant to that provision and since, contrary to Article II to which Article IV refers, that investment has not been treated fairly and equitably, turning the interference into an unlawful expropriation, which brings this aspect of the case - the export withholdings - into the purview of Article XII (2). In the words of the Tribunal in *Occidental Exploration and Production Co.,* the raising of an expropriation claim in relation to a tax matter \"brings in the standards of treatment of Article II, including fair and equitable treatment\" (see also *Enron Corp,* v, *Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 14 January 2004, ICSID case No. ARB/01/3, www.asil.org/ilib/Enron.pdf, at \u00a7 67) (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 120-126).\n\n107.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the imposition of export withholdings was contrary to commitments undertaken by Argentina under the BIT, and this amounts to expropriation. Whenever the expropriation of specific legal rights is alleged, as in the present case, this should be sufficient for an ICSID tribunal to assert its competence. What matters is whether the Claimant has shown, *prima facie,* the existence of an expropriation claim. The merits of that claim are not an issue to be decided at this preliminary stage of the proceedings. Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s thesis that this Tribunal\u2019s competence must, under Article XII of the BIT, be limited as regards the tax aspects of the claim should fail, for the measures complained of are alleged, under Article XII (2) (a), to amount to expropriations pursuant to Article IV and, consequently, to fall within the competence of this Tribunal *(ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 127-129).\n\n108.\n\nThe concessions in issue quality as investment agreements or authorizations under Article XII (2) (c) of the BIT. In *Occidental Exploration and Production Co.* (above, \u00a7 106), a tax matter associated with the performance of an investment agreement had arisen. The Tribunal pointed out that,\n\n\"[b]ecause of the relationship of the dispute with the observance and enforcement of the investment Contract involved in this case, it [had] jurisdiction to consider the dispute in connection with the merits insofar as a tax matter covered by Article X [Article XII in the present instance] may be concerned, without prejudice to the fact that jurisdiction can also be affirmed on other grounds as respects Article X\" (\u00a7 77).\n\nAccordingly, even though the claimant in the above case had related the dispute to its contract with Ecuador, the Tribunal considered it to be an investment agreement for the purposes of Article X of the BIT between the United States and Ecuador, which is the same as Article XII of the BIT involved here. And, in *Lanco International, Inc.* v. *Argentina,* Preliminary Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 December 1998 (ICSID case No. ARB/97/6, *ILM,* Vol. 40, 2001, p. 457, \u00a7 16), the Tribunal held that \"insofar as Lanco is a party to [the concession agreement, the latter] can be characterised as an investment agreement\". This conclusion was based on the fact that Lanco was not only a shareholder of the concession holder but also a party to the concession agreement. In the present case, each of the concessions can be characterised as an \"investment agreement\" under Article XII (2). While the BIT relevant here fails to define the notion of \"investment agreement\", there has been, since 1994, in BITs and free trade agreements concluded by the US, the following definition of that notion:\n\n\"a written agreement between the national authorities of a Party and a covered investment of a national or company of the other Party that (i) grants rights with respect to natural resources or other assets controlled by the national authorities and (ii) the investment, national or company relies upon in establishing or acquiring a covered investment.\"\n\nThe Claimant finds that the concessions are on all fours with the above definition. They constitute agreements between CAPSA and CAPEX, and the host Government; they grant rights to natural resources belonging to the host State; and they set investment obligations for CAPSA and CAPEX which are monitored by the Government. Hence they qualify as \"investment agreements\" under Article XII (2) (c) of the BIT.\n\n109.\n\nConfronted with these opposing views, this Tribunal feels bound to point out once again that what matters, at the present, jurisdictional stage of the proceedings is whether the claims submitted, if they were to prove well-founded, would fit into the jurisdictional parameters of the relevant treaties. If it were otherwise, one would have to await a decision on the merits prior to solving the issues of jurisdiction. It may be recalled, following the Tribunal in *Enron I* (above, \u00a7 106), that the Claimant\u2019s allegations must prove *prima facie* sufficient to justify the exercise of the right of action; for if everything were to depend on characterisations made by the Claimant alone, the limits to jurisdiction would be reduced to naught, and tribunals would be bereft of the *comp\u00e9tence de la comp\u00e9tence* enjoyed by them under Article 41 (1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n110.\n\nA first issue debated by the parties in this connexion is whether Article XII (1) of the BIT on tax matters (\"each Party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the other Party\") is law, \"softer law\" or no law at all. The last-named hypothesis will certainly have to be ruled out, despite the use of the conditional \"should\": if the Parties to the BIT had intended to instill no meaning at all into Article XII (1), they should and would have said so. Given their silence, the provision must be considered to carry some legal meaning on. the basis of the rule *ut magis valeat quam pereat* (\"effet utile\"). But even the Claimant seems to concede that the legal force of the standard embodied in Article XII is perhaps not equal to that attributed to the similarly-worded rule of Article II (2) (a) of the BIT. How and in what exactly it is not, the Claimant does not say, and possibly cannot say. And even the embarrassment of the UNCITRAL Tribunal in *Occidental Exploration and Production Co.,* when confronted with a similar situation, is evident in the passage cited earlier (\u00a7 106): on the one hand, it is asserted that the obligation imposed on the host State is \"not different from the obligation of fair and equitable treatment embodied in Article II\"; on the other hand, \"admittedly the language of Article X [here: Article XII] is less mandatory\". Nonetheless, the Claimant considers that the \"fair and equitable treatment\" clause in Article XII (1) is enforceable, though precisely on what basis one does not know. The issue may remain open, however, since in the view of the Tribunal the problem of the content of the applicable law is to be dealt with at the merits phase.\n\n111.\n\nAccording to Article XII (2), the provisions of the BIT, in particular those of Articles VII and VIII (dispute settlement), do not apply to matters of taxation, except:\n\n(i) if this matter is connected with, or amounts to, an expropriation under Article IV;\n\n(ii) if it is related to the compliance with and enforcement of an investment agreement or authorisation; or (iii) if it pertains to transfers pursuant to Article V.\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the claim raised by it is one of expropriation under Article IV and that, as a consequence, the measures taken by the Respondent, including the tax measures (export withholdings), are within ICSID jurisdiction, Article XII (2) notwithstanding. The Tribunal is of the view that, *prima facie,* the imposition of export withholdings, a tax measure, may amount to the expropriation of specific legal and contractual rights. Thus, the claims, inasmuch as they relate to tax matters, *i.e.* the export withholdings practiced by the Respondent, are within the \"exception to the exception\" provided for in Article XII (2) (a) and fall into this Tribunal\u2019s competence. This does not mean, however, that the well-foundedness of this aspect of the claims has been established; this is a matter to be determined in the proceedings on the merits.\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that its concessions form part of the present dispute and qualify as an \"investment agreement\" under Article XII (2) (c) and, thereby, under Article VII (1) (a) of the BIT. The justification of this thesis is found in *Occidental Exploration and Production Co.,* the relevant passage of which is quoted above (\u00a7 108), a case about a tax matter associated with the performance of hydrocarbon concessions and contracts which were characterised as an investment agreement. The UNCITRAL Tribunal held that there seemed indeed to be such an agreement in the framework of which the tax issue had arisen.\n\n114.\n\nAccording to this Tribunal, the Claimant has made out a *prima facie* case that there is indeed an investment agreement as that notion may be generally understood \u2014 the notion in question is not defined by the relevant BIT (see above, \u00a7 108). Accordingly, to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, the Claimant can also rely on the \"exception to the exception\" stated in Article XII (2) (c).\n\n115.\n\nThe Tribunal thus concludes that it has jurisdiction over the tax matter \u2014 the export withholdings \u2014 associated with the dispute. It is part and parcel of that dispute, which relates to expropriation under Article IV of the BIT and to the observance and enforcement of an investment agreement under Article VII (1) (a). This being so, the tax matter falls under two out of the three exceptions made in Article XII (2), which removes tax issues from the purview of ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n116.\n\nTherefore, Argentina\u2019s objection related to tax measures cannot be accepted in its generality. The Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over tax matters, but only insofar as the tax measures complained of are linked with: (a) expropriation, pursuant to Article IV; (b) transfers, pursuant to Article V; or (c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorisation as referred to in Article Vll(1)(a) or (b). In other words, the only claims that the Tribunal can consider at the merits stage are the tax claims based on the existence of an expropriation and on the violation of an investment agreement or authorisation. Everything else is beyond the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n**5. Fourth Issue: Does the Claimant Have a Legitimate Interest Authorising It to File a Claim with the Centre? The Question of** ***Jus Standi***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Does the Claimant Have Jus Standi Although it no Longer Owns the Shares Constituting its Investment?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that El Paso has no *jus standi* because it no longer is a shareholder. The Claimant, says the Respondent, holds the latter responsible for having had to sell, in 2003, its investments in the Argentine Companies and, therefore, requests the reparation of the damage allegedly suffered as a result of Argentina\u2019s measures. These allegations of damage are not, however, within the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent asks for \"true evidence\" that the Claimant was forced by it to sell its investments in the Argentine Companies, instead of mere \"fallacious arguments\" based on economic policy decisions which are sovereign acts of State and remain outside the ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction. In this connexion, Argentina draws attention to the link existing between the date of submission of the Request for Arbitration by the Claimant - 6 June 2003 \u2014 and that of the sale of all of its shares in CAPSA, CAPEX and Servicios, equally in June 2003. In October 2003, the Claimant also sold its share in Costanera. The Respondent criticises these operations, which occurred while the Claimant was already submitting a claim to the ICSID (Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 82-85).\n\n119.\n\nIf, as the Claimant says, it did not obtain optimal sales prices, this is exclusively due to the moment of sale freely chosen by it. There is no responsibility whatever on the part of Argentina, especially if the Claimant \u2014 as is the case here -presents no evidence of the allegedly forced nature of the sale. In addition, the argument of a forced sale must fail if the majority of the other foreign investors in the same area have kept their investments and have decided to continue them following proposals of the host State to re-negotiate and to increase tariffs.\n\n120.\n\nIf someone is willing to pay for an asset, the latter must have some economic value. The assertion that there are no incentives to continue with a company, given its indebtedness and the impossibility of paying dividends, is a good argument to sell out at a low price and to avoid management problems. But it is no argument for placing any responsibility on Argentina\u2019s shoulders; the Claimant acted in full capacity and freedom.\n\n121.\n\nFor Argentina it is obvious, therefore, that the existence of a dispute was \"invented\" by the Claimant to obtain BIT protection and to attempt to secure a favourable ruling from an ICSID tribunal. Consequently, the Respondent: (i) asks the Tribunal to instruct the Claimant to submit to it the balance sheets and accounts for itself and the Argentine Companies, as of the date of the sale, as well as the balance sheets and accounts of the companies which bought the Claimant\u2019s investments; and (ii) contends that, as it sold its investment in Argentina in 2003, the Claimant has no longer any interest protected under the BIT, which means that the claim cannot be maintained *(ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 86-93).\n\n122.\n\nAnother argument put forward by the Government is that, inasmuch as the investment consisted of shares, the Tribunal has no competence as Argentina did not confiscate the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings in the Argentine Companies, nor their deferred ownership rights to obtain part of these companies\u2019 assets in the event of their dissolution and after the payment of their debts. Moreover, the shares have been sold, and the Claimant can no longer be considered an investor. Indeed, says the Respondent.\n\n\"El Paso should have been a legitimate party not only at the point in time when the claim was made, but during the whole procedure. A continuous state of nationality is required by international law, and the investor has to continue being an investor during the whole proceedings\"\n\n(Transcription of Hearings, 8 April 2005, pp. 36-37).\n\n123.\n\nThe Claimant begins its argument by pointing out that the Respondent\u2019s intention to discuss its responsibility in the sale of the Claimant\u2019s investment, the timing of the sale and the amount of damages claimed goes beyond the limits of jurisdictional issues. Argentina\u2019s liability and the quantum of damages are issues which belong to the merits and which are being raised, according to the Claimant, to distract the Tribunal from jurisdictional issues and to delay a decision on jurisdiction. Thus the Claimant submits that Argentina\u2019s requests for submission of balance sheets and accounting books should be dismissed.\n\n124.\n\nThe Respondent has contended that the Claimant cannot pursue its BIT claim because it has sold its investment in Argentina. According to the Claimant, the Respondent cites no case-law, nor does it present an interpretation of the BIT or the ICSID Convention which buttresses its objection. The Respondent also ignores the principle according to which jurisdiction is assessed in the light of the situation prevailing at the date of institution of the arbitral proceedings.\n\n125.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the two treaties nowhere require a claimant to continue to own an investment after the initiation of proceedings. Nowhere is there any question of \"current\", \"ongoing\" or \"continuous\" ownership of the investment. On the contrary, the BIT contemplates the absence of ownership of the investment at the moment at which the proceedings are brought; all it requires is that the protected investments were directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a protected person or entity when the claims arose.\n\n126.\n\nUnder Article 25 of the ICSID Convention there is, according to the Claimant, a temporal limitation on the ability of the nationals of one Contracting Party to present a claim: they must have the nationality of another Contracting State and may not acquire that of the respondent State. But no continuous ownership is required, as the ICSID Convention was meant, among other things, to protect against nationalisations and expropriations, *i.e.* in cases where the national no longer owns the investment but seeks compensation for having been deprived of it by the host State (CounterMemorial, on Jurisdiction \u00a7\u00a7 94-99).\n\n127.\n\nThe principle discussed in the preceding paragraphs has been applied by ICSID tribunals. This was the case in *CSOB* v. *Slovakia,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 May 1999 (ICSID case No. ARB/97/4, *ICSID Review,* Vol. 14, 1999, p. 251), where it was stated that (\u00a731):\n\n\"It is generally recognized that the determination whether a party has standing in an international judicial forum for purposes of jurisdiction to institute proceedings is made by reference to the date on which such proceedings are deemed to have been instituted. Since the Claimant instituted these proceedings prior to the time when the two assignments were concluded, it follows that the tribunal has jurisdiction to hear their case regardless of the legal effect, if any, the assignments might have had on Claimant\u2019s standing had they preceded the filing of the case.\"\n\n128.\n\nA second case in point is *Tradex Hellas* v. *Albania,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 24 December 1996 (ICSID case No. ARB/94/2, *ICSID Review,* Vol. 14, 1999, p. 161), where a Greek company involved in a joint venture in that country claimed that measures taken by the State amounted to an expropriation. In that case, the investment was liquidated in 1993, but the request for arbitration was made only in 1994, which led Albania to argue that the claimant was not a foreign investor at the time Albania consented to jurisdiction. The Tribunal found, however, that Albania\u2019s consent, though given in 1993, retroacted to investments made in 1990 and rejected Albania\u2019s objection. In so doing, it pointed out that Albania\u2019s consent \"does (...) not require that the investment still exists at the time the law comes into force or the dispute arises\" (p. 182).\n\n129.\n\nA third relevant precedent, which arose under Chapter 11 of NAFTA, is *Mondev International, Ltd.* v. *United States,* Decision on Jurisdiction of 11 October 2002 (ICSID case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, www.state.gov/socuments/organization /!4442.pdf). In that case, the investor lost ownership of its investment in 1991 as a result of the foreclosure of a mortgage due to delays in a real estate development project imputable to the City of Boston. Here the Tribunal found that the NAFTA dispute settlement procedures\n\n\"will frequently have to be applied after the investment in question has failed. In most cases, the dispute will concern precisely the question of responsibility for that failure. To require the claimant to maintain a continuing status as an investor under the law of the host State at the time the arbitration is commenced would tend to frustrate the very purpose of Chapter 11, which is to provide protection to investors against wrongful conduct including uncompensated expropriation of their investment and to do so throughout the lifetime of an investment up to the moment of its sale or other disposition\" (\u00a791).\n\n130.\n\nEl Paso sold its interests in CAPSA and CAPEX on 23 June 2003, two and one half weeks after bringing its claim, and its interest in Costanera on 3 October of the same year. Before the sale, the price of which amounted to less than 10% of the original investment, El Paso had suffered the negative effects of the Respondent\u2019s conduct (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 101, 114).\n\n131.\n\nThe proceedings instituted by the Claimant were registered on 12 June 2003, while the sales mentioned in the preceding paragraph occurred on 23 June and 3 October 2003. They do not, therefore, affect the Claimant\u2019s standing and ICSID jurisdiction. What is more, the Claimant asserts that the sale was forced in the sense that the damage is alleged to be due to the measures taken by the Respondent. It was those measures which triggered the present dispute and the sale by El Paso of its investments in the Argentine Companies. That sale was, according to the Claimant, made \"in order to mitigate the already devastating effects that the measures of the Government had on Claimant\u2019s investments in Argentina\" (Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 113). Not only was there no obligation on the part of the Claimant, according to it, to retain its investment after the registration of the claim; it would also have been unreasonable to require it to do so as that would have resulted in increasing the damage *(ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 105, 112-115).\n\n132.\n\nTo conclude, the Claimant asks the Tribunal to reject the Respondent\u2019s requests for the submission of the Claimant\u2019s and the Argentine Companies\u2019 financial records and for the communication of more information on the date of the sale (see above, \u00a7 121). It equally requests the Tribunal to dismiss Argentina\u2019s objection to ICSID jurisdiction based on the fact that the Claimant no longer owns its investment.\n\n133.\n\nAt the hearing of 8 April 2005, the Tribunal requested the Claimant to provide documents regarding the sale of its shares. These documents were duly provided. Another request was made by the Respondent on 6 May 2005 for the production of additional documents regarding the Claimant\u2019s investment and the sale thereof. This request was \"strongly objected to\" by the Claimant, while the Respondent explained why the request was relevant to the jurisdictional aspect of the proceedings. Argentina\u2019s request was, however, rejected by the Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. 1 in which it held that:\n\n\"1. The information in possession of the Tribunal is sufficient to decide the jurisdictional issues raised by the Respondent.\n\n2. If the proceedings reach the merits of the dispute, it will be open to the Respondent to reiterate the above request for the production of documents.\"\n\n134.\n\nIn its argument, the Respondent has contested the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the sale of the investments was \"forced\" by its conduct. According to this Tribunal, and on the strength of what it considers to be \u2014 or not to be \u2014 questions of jurisdiction, the points raised by the Respondent properly belong to the merits of the case.\n\n135.\n\nThus, the issue to be discussed here is the alleged lack of ICSID jurisdiction because the investments in question no longer are the Claimant\u2019s or, to put it differently, because the latter must retain its investor status during the examination of its international claims. An examination of the relevant texts - the BIT and the ICSID Convention - and of the case-law cited by the Claimant reveal, however, that there is no such rule (above, \u00a7\u00a7 125-129). In other words, there is no rule of continuous ownership of the investment. The reason for there not being such a rule in the ICSID/BIT context is that the issues addressed by those instruments are precisely those of confiscation, expropriation and nationalisation of foreign investments. Once the taking has occurred, there is nothing left except the possibility of using the ICSID/BIT mechanism. That purpose would be defeated if continuous ownership were required. Thus the claim continues to exist, *i.e.* the right to demand compensation for the injury suffered at the hands of the State remains \u2014 unless, of course, it can be shown that it was sold with the investment.\n\n136.\n\nIn the instant case, the claim was submitted on 6 June 2003 and registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 12 June 2003, both dates at which El Paso still owned the investments. While the proximity of those dates especially for the first sale may appear disturbing \u2014 preparation of the latter must have been well under way by 6 or 12 June -, it does in no way warrant the conclusion that *prima facie* there is no claim falling under ICSID jurisdiction.\n\n*(b) Does the Claimant Have Jus Standi Although it was Only an Indirect Minority Shareholder?*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant has no *jus standi* as it only has an indirect minority shareholding. The Claimant asks the Tribunal to disregard the arguments presented by the Respondent concerning the *jus standi* of foreign shareholders\u2019 claims, especially those relating to minority shareholdings, because they were presented for the first time at the Hearings, *i.e.* too late under Rule 41(1) of the Arbitration Rules according to which preliminary objections must be filed, at the latest, on the date fixed for the filing of the Counter-Memorial (Transcription of Hearings, 8 April 2005, pp. 56-57). The Respondent replied that no new issues were introduced and that \"the shareholding matter, indirect shareholding in the case of Enron is mentioned in Paragraph (40) and in footnote (45) at page 13 as well\" and that there are references also in the Claimant\u2019s Memorial (*ibid.,* pp. 150-151).\n\n138.\n\nNo references of the kind mentioned by the Respondent at the Hearings nor, more generally, references to minority shareholders\u2019 claims may be found in the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, while the references in Claimant\u2019s Memorial, if any, are clearly irrelevant. The Respondent\u2019s argument concerning the *jus standi* of minority shareholders is therefore inadmissible under Rule 41(1) of the Arbitration Rules. But even if it were admissible, it would not be of much help to the Respondent for reasons similar to those mentioned by the Decision on Jurisdiction in the *LG&E* case (see above, \u00a7 58), according to which (Decision, \u00a7 50) the shares owned by the claimants in local companies \"are the investment within the meaning of Article 1(1) (a)(ii) of the Bilateral Treaty\" and it is irrelevant whether the shares are majority or minority shares\".\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore decides to reject the objection to its competence related to the fourth issue.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n140.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal decides that the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the ICSID and within the competence of the Tribunal. The Order necessary for the pursuit of the procedure under Arbitration Rule 41 (4) has, accordingly, been made."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2011-10-31T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\nA. Registration of the Request for Arbitration\n----------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 6 June 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter the \"Centre\") received a request for arbitration (hereinafter the \"Request\") submitted by El Paso Energy International Company (hereinafter \"El Paso\" or \"the Claimant\"), a company organised under the laws of the State of Delaware (United States of America) against the Republic of Argentina (hereinafter \"Argentina,\" \"the Respondent,\" \"the respondent State,\" \"the respondent Government\" or \"GOA\").\n\n2.\n\nOn the same date, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"Institution Rules\"), the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Request.\n\n3.\n\nIn the Request, the Claimant submitted that Argentina had violated the 1991 Treaty Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment between the Republic of Argentina and the United States of America (hereinafter \"the BIT\")1, as well as other Argentinian and international law instruments.\n\nTreaty between United States of America and the Republic of Argentina concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment of 14 November 1991 (entered into force on 20 October 1994), available at: http://www.unctad.org/sections/dite/iia/docs/bits/argentina\\_us.pdf (hereinafter 1991 BIT).\n\n4.\n\nThe Request was registered by the Centre on 12 June 2003, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\" or \"the Washington Convention\")2 and Rules 6(1)(a) and 7(a) of the Institution Rules. On the same date, the Acting Secretary-General notified the Parties of the registration and invited them to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible.\n\nThe Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States [hereinafter ICSID Convention or the Washington Convention] of 18 March 1965 (entered into force on 14 October 1966).\n\nB. Parties\n----------\n\n5.\n\nThe present dispute is between El Paso International Energy Company and the Republic of Argentina. It raises the question of whether Argentina has breached the Treaty between the United States and Argentina of 14 November 1991 concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment as regards investments made by the Claimant in Argentina.\n\n6.\n\nEl Paso is a United States company incorporated in the State of Delaware. It had that quality \"on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to... arbitration\" (Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention), *i.e.* when it accepted the jurisdiction of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter \"ICSID\").\n\n7.\n\nAs indicated by its name, the Claimant is an energy company. It alleges that, up until 2003, it owned indirect and non-controlling shareholdings in a number of Argentinian entities: Compa\u00f1\u00edas Asociadas Petroleras (CAPSA) and CAPEX SA (El Paso contends that it held a 45% indirect interest in CAPSA which, in turn, owned 60.36% of the shares of CAPEX); Central Costanera SA (Costanera), in which El Paso claims to have acquired a 12,335% indirect interest; and Gasoducto del Pac\u00edfico SA (Pacifico), in which its indirect interest was said to amount to approximately 13.4% (preferred shares), and 11.8% (ordinary shares) respectively. These four entities have been collectively referred to, in the present proceedings, as the \"Argentinian companies.\" El Paso further alleged an indirect controlling interest (99.92%) in SERVICIOS El Paso, another entity incorporated in Argentina, and a 61.6% interest in the Triunion Energy Company.\n\n8.\n\nThe respondent State argued, however, that these direct and indirect interests had not been proved by the Claimant. The latter had, shortly after filing its Reply, submitted an amended version of paragraphs 314-326 of that document to the Arbitral Tribunal. According to the respondent State, a comparison between the amended text and the original one yielded serious discrepancies.\n\n9.\n\nThus, the Claimant had alleged, in its original Reply, ownership of a 61.6% interest in Triunion, whereas the amended text referred to 71,968%. In the original Reply, it had also been asserted that 0.0084% of Gasoducto del Pacifico (Argentina) S.A. was owned by Gasoducto del Pacifico (Cayman) Ltd., while the amended Reply spoke of 87.5%. In the initial Reply, there had been a question of El Paso holding 21,799% of Gasoducto del Pac\u00edfico (Argentina) S.A., a figure that was subsequently corrected to 12.5% (common shares) and 21.8% (preferred shares). Further discrepancies appeared in connection with Agua del Caj\u00f3n (Cayman), the Reply\u2019s original text having alleged a 100% ownership of that company by El Paso, the subsequent one reducing that figure to 50%, the latter figure also appearing in documents filed by the Claimant with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. Finally, the Claimant asserted that, through the sale of its interests in the Argentinian companies, it secured an additional equity interest of 6.3% in Gasoducto del Pac\u00edfico (Argentina) S.A., an assertion which has remained unproven as well.3\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits [hereinafter Rejoinder] of 12 March 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 86-92.\n\n10.\n\nIn April 1997, El Paso acquired, through KLT Power Inc., an indirect noncontrolling shareholding of 12,335% in Costanera. The latter, a local company engaged in the generation and sale of electricity, with a total capacity of 2311 megawatt-hour (MWh), is the largest thermal generator in Argentina. It owns approximately 10% of the installed generation capacity in the country, with a plant that includes two state-of-the-art combined cycle units located in the city of Buenos Aires.\n\n11.\n\nIn January 1998, El Paso acquired an indirect non-controlling interest in Pacifico, which owns and operates a natural gas pipeline linking Argentina to the Chilean city of Cochabamba. That interest amounted to 13.4% of the preferred shares and 11.8% of the ordinary shares of Pacifico.4\n\nSee *supra* \u00a7 7\n\n12.\n\nFurther observations are in order regarding SERVICIOS, Costanera and Pacifico. SERVICIOS was established by El Paso as an Argentinian subsidiary in March 1998 and entered thereafter into an agreement with an Argentinian branch of the Bank of Boston to lease a gas processing plant located on the Agua de Caj\u00f3n field in Neuqu\u00e9n Province. Pursuant to a ten-year gas processing agreement with CAPEX, SERVICIOS transformed gas produced at CAPEX\u2019s facilities into liquid petroleum gas (LPG) by-products that were sold by CAPEX.\n\n13.\n\nIt is alleged that, from 1997 to 2001, El Paso invested US$ 336 million in the Argentinian companies, and that its parent company guaranteed around US$ 24 million of SERVICIOS\u2019 lease obligations. El Paso sold its interest in the companies\u2019 shares in two sales, one in June 2003 - in CAPSA (consequently in CAPEX) and in SERVICIOS - another in October 2003 - in Costanera.\n\n14.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Argentina.\n\nC. Constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and Commencement of the Proceedings\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe Parties agreed that the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party and the third and presiding arbitrator to be appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the Centre.\n\n16.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant appointed Professor Piero Bernardini (Italian) as an arbitrator and the Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stem (French) as an arbitrator. The Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID, with the agreement of the Parties, appointed Professor Lucius Caflisch (Swiss) as President of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nPursuant to Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), the Centre informed the Parties that all arbitrators having accepted their appointment, the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have commenced on 6 February 2004. In accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the Parties were also notified that Ms. Gabriela Alvarez-Avila, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nAfter consultation with the Parties, the first session of the Tribunal was held on 21 April 2004 in Geneva. The Claimant was represented at the session by Mr. R. Doak Bishop and Mr. Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz (Jr.). The Respondent was represented by Mr. Jorge Barraguirre and Ms. Maria Vallejos Meana of the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, who were present at the session on behalf of the Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Dr. Horacio Daniel Rosatti.\n\n19.\n\nAt the first session, the Parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and that they had no objection to any of the members of the Tribunal. It was agreed that the proceedings would be conducted under the Arbitration Rules in force since 1 January 2003.\n\n20.\n\nIt was decided that the Claimant would file its Memorial on the Merits within 90 days of the date of the first session, that the Respondent would file its Counter-Memorial on the Merits within 90 days of the date of receipt of the Memorial, that the Claimant\u2019s Reply would be filed within 45 days of the date of receipt of the Counter-Memorial, and that the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder would be filed within a further 45 days of the receipt of the Reply. It was further agreed that the Respondent had the right to raise any objections it might have to jurisdiction no later than 45 days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial. If such objections to jurisdiction were made by the Respondent, the Claimant would have 45 days to file its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction. The Tribunal would decide at a later stage, after having consulted the Parties, whether a second round of pleadings on jurisdiction would be necessary.\n\nD. Jurisdictional Phase of the Proceedings\n------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits on 20 August 2004. The Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 19 October 2004 and the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on 13 December 2004.\n\n22.\n\nAfter having considered the views of the Parties, the Tribunal decided on 3 February 2005 that a second round of pleadings on jurisdiction was not necessary and fixed the date for the hearing on jurisdiction on 7 April 2005. On 25 February 2005, the Tribunal announced that the hearing on jurisdiction was re-scheduled for 8 April 2005.\n\n23.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on 8 April 2005. The Claimant was represented by Mr. R. Doak Bishop, Mr. Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Mart\u00ednez de Hoz (Jr.), Mr. Tomasz J. Sikora, Mr. Craig S. Miles, Ms. Valeria Macchia and Ms. Angolie Singh. The Respondent was represented by Mr. Jorge Barraguirre, Ms. Gisela Makowski, and Ms. Cintia Yaryura from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n.\n\n24.\n\nDuring the hearing, counsel for the Parties made presentations to the Tribunal, and *as per* the Respondent\u2019s request, Mr. Ed Sereno\u2019s testimony was heard. The Claimant briefly presented the witness; this was followed by cross-examination from the Respondent and redirect from the Claimant. The Tribunal then asked the witness some questions. Verbatim transcripts of the hearing were drawn up in English and Spanish and were distributed to the Tribunal and the Parties.\n\n25.\n\nDuring the hearing on jurisdiction, the Tribunal requested some documents from both Parties. By letter of 14 April 2005, the Claimant responded to the request regarding the sale of its shares in Compa\u00f1\u00edas Asociadas Petroleras S.A. (CAPSA), CAPEX S.A. and SERVICIOS El Paso S R L. On 6 May 2005, the Respondent provided certain documents to the Tribunal regarding the financial structure of Transportadora Gas del Norte and Metrogas, as well as the taxes imposed on the gas sector. In the same letter, the Respondent asked for the production by the Claimant of documents regarding its investment and the sale of its shares in the above-mentioned companies. On 10 June 2005, the Claimant objected to the Respondent\u2019s request of 6 May 2005. The Respondent answered the Claimant\u2019s objections by a letter of 27 June 2005.\n\n26.\n\nBy Procedural Order No. 1 of 28 July 2005, the Tribunal decided that \"the information in possession of the Tribunal [was] sufficient to decide the jurisdictional issues raised by the Respondent and that if the proceedings were to reach the merits of the dispute, it [would] be open to the Respondent to reiterate the above request for production of documents\".\n\n27.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction of 27 April 2006, the Tribunal decided that the dispute was within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within the competence of the Tribunal. On the same date, it issued Procedural Order No. 2 by which the Tribunal confirmed the calendar agreed upon during the first session. Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits was due within 90 days from the date of Procedural Order No. 2, the Claimant\u2019s Reply within 45 days from its receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, and the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder within 45 days from its receipt of the Claimant\u2019s Reply.\n\nE. Merits Phase of the Proceedings\n----------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nBy letter of 6 June 2006, the Respondent requested the Tribunal (i) to order the Claimant to produce a number of additional documents related to its claim; (ii) to suspend the filing of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits until the requested documents were submitted; and (iii) to extend the deadline for the filing of the Counter-Memorial on the Merits by 60 days.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter of 21 June 2006, the Claimant produced a number of the documents requested by the Respondent and objected to the production of some others, as well as to the suspension and extension for the filing of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial.\n\n30.\n\nOn 5 July 2006, the Tribunal decided to grant a 30-day extension for the filing of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial and requested the Respondent to make its observations on the Claimant\u2019s letter of 21 June 2006. By letter of 5 July 2006, the Respondent repeated its requests. On 11 July 2006, the Respondent asked the Tribunal to (i) order the Claimant to produce four sets of documents; and (ii) extend the time-limit for the filing of its Counter-Memorial on the Merits by the number of days taken by the Claimant to produce all such documents. By letter of 13 July 2006, the Claimant produced additional documents and objected to the Respondent\u2019s request for an additional extension of the time-limit.\n\n31.\n\nOn 26 July 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, by which it ordered the Claimant to produce by 3 August 2006 documents demonstrating how El Paso acquired its direct participation in Gasoducto del Pac\u00edfico (Argentina) S.A., in order to have a complete picture of El Paso\u2019s ownership in Triunion Energy Co., Cayman. The Tribunal also took note of the Claimant\u2019s explanation of 13 July 2006 regarding CAPSA\u2019s financial statement of 2003 and invited the Claimant to make that statement available. The remaining requests submitted by the Respondent for production of documents were denied and the Tribunal fixed 1 September 2006 as the date for the filing of the Counter-Memorial on the Merits. In accordance with the schedule set by the Tribunal in its Procedural Order No. 3, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits on that date.\n\n32.\n\nBy letter of 25 September 2006, the Claimant requested a 30-day extension for the filing of its Reply. This request was objected to by the Respondent in a letter of 26 September 2006. On 4 October 2006, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it granted the requested extension and therefore fixed 28 November 2006 as the date for the filing of the Claimant\u2019s Reply.\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of 12 October 2006, the Respondent also requested a 30-day extension for the filing of its Rejoinder and a suspension of the schedule of the proceedings during January 2007. By letter of 19 October 2006, the Claimant agreed to the requested extension but objected to the suspension of the procedural schedule. On 26 October 2006, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it decided not to grant the suspension requested by the Respondent but to grant the 30-day extension for the filing of the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder. Therefore, the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder was due within 75 days from the receipt of the Spanish translation of the Claimant\u2019s Reply and accompanying documentation. The Claimant submitted the electronic copy of its Reply Memorial on the Merits on 28 November 2006, while the hard copy of the Claimant\u2019s Reply and the accompanying documentation were dispatched by a courier company on 29 November 2006.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter of 14 December 2006, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to disregard the Claimant\u2019s Reply because it was filed late. The Tribunal carefully examined the Respondent\u2019s request as well as the Claimant\u2019s letter of 18 December 2006 and the Respondent\u2019s observations of 20 December 2006.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter of 3 January 2007, the Tribunal decided not to disregard the filing; however - in view of the circumstances - it granted the Respondent until 12 March 2007 to file its Rejoinder. The Respondent filed its Rejoinder on that date.\n\n36.\n\nBy the Claimant\u2019s letters of 23, 25 and 26 April 2007 and the Respondent\u2019s letters of 24 and 25 April 2007, the Parties submitted their preliminary views about the conduct of the hearing on the merits scheduled for June 2007. By letter of 8 May 2007, the Tribunal confirmed that the hearing would be held from 4 through 13 June 2007 (including Saturday 9 June 2007). It decided to grant each Party equal time to present factual witnesses and experts and to make their Opening and Closing Statements. Since the Parties failed to reach agreement on the order of appearance of factual witnesses and experts, the Tribunal decided that they were to be presented in the following order: (i) the Claimant\u2019s factual witnesses; (ii) the Respondent\u2019s factual witnesses; (iii) the Claimant\u2019s experts; and (iv) the Respondent\u2019s experts.\n\n37.\n\nThe hearing on the merits was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. from 4 to 13 June 2007. The Claimant was represented by Mr. R. Doak Bishop, Mr. Craig Miles, Mr. Adam Schiffer, Mr. Roberto Aguirre-Luzi, and Mrs. Sarah Zagata (King & Spalding); Mr. Jos\u00e9 A. Martinez de Hoz (Jr.), Ms. Valeria Macchia, Ms. Jimena Vega Olmos and Ms. Florencia Monica Celasco (P\u00e9rez Alati, Grondona Benites, Amtsen & Mart\u00ednez de Hoz); and Mr. Tomasz J. Sikora, in-house counsel of El Paso Energy. The Respondent was represented by Mr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino (Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina), Mr. Ignacio Per\u00e9z Cort\u00e9s, Mr. Gabriel Bottini, Ms. Gisela Makowski, Ms. Silvina Gonz\u00e1lez Napolitano, Mr. Tom\u00e1s Braceras, Mr. Jorge Barraguirre, Ms. Alejandra Etchegorry, Ms. Leticia Sierra Lobos, Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Duhalde, Mr. Javier Gallo Mendoza, Mr. Juan Pablo Tarelli, Mr. Luciano Lombardi, Mr. Rodrigo Ruiz Esquide and Mr. Ignacio Torterola. Counsel for the Parties gave their oral presentations before the Tribunal and examined the factual witnesses and experts.\n\n38.\n\nVerbatim transcripts of the hearing on the merits were prepared and distributed to the Tribunal and the Parties. The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a joint document with both Parties\u2019 corrections to the transcripts of the hearing in order to facilitate the Tribunal\u2019s review and reading of the transcripts.\n\n39.\n\nFurther to the receipt of the Claimant\u2019s letters of 20 May, 11 July and 8 September 2008, and the Respondent\u2019s letter dated 19 August 2008, the Tribunal informed the Parties that any filings made by the Parties and not expressly authorised by the Tribunal would be disregarded.\n\n40.\n\nBy letters of 21 November 2007 and 13 December 2007, it was confirmed that the members of the Tribunal had decided to retain an independent expert, who would assist them in the review of the expert reports filed by the Parties. The Tribunal requested the ICC International Centre for Expertise to provide a list of names from its database of experts.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal reviewed the *curricula vitae* of a number of possible candidates and submitted their names to the Parties. Upon receipt of both Parties\u2019 observations, by 21 May 2008, the Tribunal appointed Mr. Fran\u00e7ois Savagner as its independent valuation expert.\n\n42.\n\nBy letter of 12 September 2008, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had not been able to reach an agreement with Mr. Savagner on the amount of fees that the Tribunal considered reasonable for his assignment. It invited the Parties to submit their observations on the expert\u2019s estimate to decide whether they authorised or not the continuation of the expert\u2019s appointment.\n\n43.\n\nBy letter of 30 September 2008, the Tribunal informed the Parties that since they had not reached an agreement with respect to the acceptance of the estimate, it would terminate the expert\u2019s assignment. The expert had already agreed to renounce claims to any fees and or expenses incurred before that decision.\n\n44.\n\nBy letter of 7 January 2009, the Tribunal submitted the name of another possible expert and solicited the Parties\u2019 observations. Upon receipt of the Parties\u2019 observations on 23 January 2009, the Tribunal invited each Party to submit a list of four candidates along with their *curricula vitae.* The list of each Party was to be communicated to the other Party. If there were one or more common names on both lists, the Tribunal would proceed to make an appointment.\n\n45.\n\nThe Tribunal informed the Parties that if there were no common names on both lists, each Party was invited to comment on the other Party\u2019s list within eight days of the receipt of that list. Upon receipt of the Parties\u2019 comments, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would make a final decision either on the basis of the lists or at its own discretion. The Parties submitted their proposals and exchanged their comments on each other\u2019s lists.\n\n46.\n\nBy letter of 15 June 2009, the Tribunal appointed Professor Patrice Geoffron as its independent expert. By letter of October 27, 2009, the Centre transmitted to the Parties an order to provide additional documentation to the expert as well as a confidentiality undertaking signed by Professor Geoffron. As ordered by the Tribunal, both Parties submitted the requested additional documentation to the expert. The Expert\u2019s Preliminary Report was circulated to the Parties on 14 April 2010. The Tribunal invited both Parties to submit any observations regarding the expert\u2019s Preliminary Report at the latest by May 14, 2010. In addition, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to submit, along with the above-mentioned observations, its answers to some further questions. By letter of May 19, 2010, the Tribunal granted an extension to the Parties for submitting their observations on the Preliminary Report. Both Parties submitted their observations on June 1, 2010. By letter of 22 November, 2011, the Tribunal circulated the Expert\u2019s July Report and a Complementary Note dated 10 July 2010, followed by the Final Report (October Report) dated 12 October 2010 and invited the Parties to submit their observations on both documents by 24 December, 2010. By letter of December 15, 2010 the Tribunal granted an extension for the Parties to submit their observations on the Expert\u2019s Final Report at the latest by 27 December, 2010. Both Parties submitted their observations on the date set by the Tribunal.\n\n47.\n\nBy letters of 22 November and 15 December 2010, the Tribunal invited the Parties to present their statement on costs, which were received on 27 December 2010. By letter dated 5 May 2011, the Tribunal declared the closure of the proceedings pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38. On June 1, 2011 the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their final statements of costs pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(2). The Respondent submitted its final statement of costs on June 15, 2011, and the Claimant on 16 June 2011.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\nA. The Origins of the Dispute\n-----------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe facts summarised hereafter are those considered and debated in the Parties\u2019 written pleadings and oral arguments.\n\n49.\n\nCAPSA produces oil and, *via* CAPEX, generates electric power in Argentina; it also markets propane, butane and gasoline. From December 2001 onward, the GOA took a series of measures which, according to the Claimant, caused considerable harm to the latter, breached undertakings assumed by the respondent State when the investments were made, rendered the investments worthless, particularly those in CAPSA and CAPEX, and prevented these companies from functioning independently. These measures were alleged to be in violation of provisions of the 1991 BIT, *i.e.* those on expropriation, on discriminatory treatment, on fair and equitable treatment, and on full protection and security.5\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits [hereinafter Memorial] of 20 August 2004, \u00a7\u00a7 30-33 and 37-38.\n\n50.\n\nThese assertions were vigorously objected to by the Government which argued that the measures taken by it, even if they had been contrary to provisions of the 1991 BIT, were justified under Article XI of that Treaty which allows the States Parties to take measures needed for the maintenance of public order, for the fulfilment of their obligations regarding the maintenance or the restoration of international peace or security, or for the protection of their own essential security interests.6\n\nRespondent\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief [hereinafter RPHB] of 2 August 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 119-211.\n\nB. The Legal Situation at the Time of the Investment\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. History and General Context***\n------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nPrior to 1990, most of Argentina\u2019s essential economic activities were State-run. The infrastructures were unsatisfactory, however, and the public debt was high, particularly regarding the production of energy, *i.e.* electricity and hydrocarbons. This led the GOA to introduce, in 1989, a bill which was to become the State Reform Law, announcing a privatisation programme encompassing incentives as well as monetary and structural measures to promote foreign investment and to stabilise the country\u2019s economy.\n\n52.\n\nPrior to these reforms, the electricity market had been dominated by the State. Public enterprises controlled the production, transmission and distribution of energy. In addition, some provinces ran their own energy companies. The system was flawed by insufficient funding, rife with inefficiency and was in deficit. In 1988/1989, rolling black-outs were organised owing to limited power-generating capacity.\n\n53.\n\nThe oil and gas sector, too, was essentially in the hands of the State, with private business playing a secondary role. It was characterised by low productivity, excess demand and significant deficits for the State-owned companies.\n\n54.\n\nLaws Nos. 23,696 and 23,697, referred to respectively as the \"State Reform Law\" and the \"Economic Emergency Law,\" brought a radical change by deregulating the economy and offering some public companies for sale. In addition, Law No. 23,928, the \"Convertibility Law,\" complemented by Decree No. 529/1991, pegged the peso to the dollar at a fixed rate of 1:1, and no increase in the domestic monetary supply would henceforth be permitted without a corresponding increase in the Central Bank\u2019s foreign currency holdings. As a consequence, inflation abated and the economy grew during the period from 1991 to 1997.\n\n55.\n\nThe State Reform Law, with its measures of liberalisation and improvement of the public sector, and the call for foreign investment, aimed at the privatisation of State companies to improve production.\n\n56.\n\nA reform of the legislation on foreign investment was mainly brought about by Decree No. 1853/1993. That Decree encouraged foreign investment by removing various restrictions, notably the three-year waiting period for the repatriation of foreign capital, allowing for such repatriation at any time; and by opening domestic credit facilities to both foreign and national businesses on an equal footing.\n\n57.\n\nFurther to improve the domestic context, Argentina concluded about 50 bilateral investment treaties (BITs), one of which was the 1991 BIT with the United States.\n\n58.\n\nFinally, to protect investors\u2019 long-term interests, regulatory regimes were established for the electricity and hydrocarbon sectors. Together these regimes, the Electricity and the Hydrocarbons Regulatory Frameworks, formed the new \"Energy Regulatory Framework.\"\n\n***2. Electricity Regulatory Framework***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nTo improve the supply of electricity, the GOA allowed foreign investors a dominant role in the production, transmission and distribution of electric energy. They could acquire facilities and equity interests and also proceed to direct investments. Investments had to be made within the legal framework provided by Law No. 24,065 (the \"Electricity Law\"), by Regulatory Decree No. 1398/1992 and related regulations, and by Resolution No. 61/1992.\n\n60.\n\nThe objectives of the Electricity Law were the promotion of private investments in the production, transmission and distribution of electrical power, the setting of appropriate rates in order to further such activities, the efficient use of electricity, and the stimulation of competition.\n\n61.\n\nWithin the Electricity Regulatory Framework, a competitive system, the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM), was established in order to organise the sale of energy by its generators. The two markets established within the WEM were: (i) the term market, where producers and buyers could freely agree on sales, conditions and prices; and (ii) the spot market, where energy was supplied, on an hourly basis, for a uniform price linked to the short-term marginal cost of the energy produced.\n\n62.\n\nDistributors were, however, entitled to buy energy at a \"seasonal price\" fixed by the Compa\u00f1\u00eda Administradora del Mercado Mayorista El\u00e9ctrico SA (CAMMESA) and approved by the GOA\u2019s Energy Secretariat. This was achieved by establishing a fixed monthly charge which was to remain stable for the first three months of the six-month seasonal price; that price was based on predictions of demand and supply in the seasonal period. After three months, adjustments would have to be made if the seasonal price, instead of reflecting the average spot-market price, significantly differed from it. This was to be done by providing compensation out of a \"Seasonal Stabilisation Fund,\" yet another measure to protect investors.\n\n63.\n\nThe Electricity Regulatory Framework was managed by three agencies. The first was the GOA\u2019s Secretariat of Energy, endowed with regulatory powers to implement the Framework. It was to govern dispatch within the WEM and to set seasonal prices. The scheduling and physical dispatch by generators and the management of the WEM were handled by CAMMESA, an independent entity representing all WEM agents but subject to the veto of the Energy Secretariat. Thirdly, there was the Ente Nacional Regulador de la Electricidad (ENRE), an independent governmental body with regulatory and jurisdictional power over the electricity industry.\n\n64.\n\nThe spot price was the price paid at any hour to all participants in the WEM. It was uniform, based on the short-term marginal cost incurred by the least efficient generator dispatched at any given hour. This Variable Cost of Production (VCP) had to be indicated in US dollars. The most efficient producer, *i.e.* that with the lowest VCP, was dispatched first and enjoyed the largest profit, as the spot price would be set on the basis of the VCP of the last generator dispatched. Accordingly, the spot price determined by CAMMESA was not arbitrary: the most efficient generator\u2019s VCP was below the spot price, and the difference between that price and the VCP incurred by the last generator dispatched was the margin of the most efficient producer. In other words, not all producers enjoyed the same margin.\n\n65.\n\nThe competitive system described above rewarded efficient power generators such as CAPEX and Costanera by the manner in which spot prices and margins were fixed. This, together with the security offered by the Electricity Regulatory Framework, provided an incentive for El Paso to invest.\n\n66.\n\nBy contrast, contractual energy sales could be freely negotiated. As a rule, they were made in US dollars and for one year, prices being set proportionally to the spot price and somewhat above it.\n\n67.\n\nIn addition to the sales proceeds, since 1994 power generators received \"capacity payments\" amounting to 10 US dollars per megawatt-hour (MWh). These payments were intended to encourage operators to upgrade and expand the electricity system. Capacity payments, with the proceeds from the sales, were the two pillars of the new Framework; according to the Claimant, the capacity payments received by CAPEX and Costanera amounted to about 27 and 92 million US dollars per year, respectively.7 The Claimant also alleged that, on the basis of these payments, investors could legitimately expect that if a devaluation of the peso were to occur, capacity payments would continue to be paid in US dollars or, if paid in pesos, be adjusted to attain the same value;8 and that adjustments would also be made in the pricing system.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 146-147.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 152.\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s assertions were vigorously objected to by the respondent State.9 According to the latter, the establishment of capacity payments, and their decrease in terms of US dollars, did not, from the legal and economic viewpoint, entail an undue prejudice. The Electricity Law, while providing for such payments, left the determination of the currency and of the mode of calculation to Argentina\u2019s Department of Energy. Initially, in 1992, capacity payments were fixed at US$ 5 dollars/MWh, this figure being subsequently raised to US$ 10 dollars. In 2002, payments decreased to AR$ 10 pesos, to be raised again to AR$ 12 pesos three months later. At the same time, the Energy Secretariat detached payment from actual dispatch, a measure favourable to the producers. There were not, accordingly, any vested rights in those respects.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 111-126.\n\n69.\n\nNor was there any undue prejudice from an economic point of view. The value of the capacity payments determined by the Secretary of Energy was, according to the GOA, compatible with the operation of the electricity market in the context of the crisis and with what would have happened, in that context, in a competitive market, given the macroeconomic circumstances prevailing at the time in the Argentine economy. At that time, a significant decrease in the demand for reliability of the electricity supplies was expected as a result of the drop of the economy\u2019s gross product and household income: \"if an income drop occurs, a lower quality product at a lower price is preferred.\"10\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 118.\n\n70.\n\nAt the beginning of the crisis, the electricity generation system enjoyed a high reserve margin. Despite the fact that, during the last years, no new producers had appeared, the existing ones were capable of satisfying a 12.3% increase in the peak demand. This shows that the system had excess capacity; accordingly, the reduction of capacity made perfect sense in a competitive market.\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimant considered that the capacity payment had to cover their capital costs and that the reduction in it to an amount equivalent to four dollars did not fulfill that requirement. The GOA rejected El Paso\u2019s arguments11 linking the Claimant\u2019s capacity payments to its capital costs: there was no rule under which the main ground for capacity payments was the protection of capital costs or the recovery of investments, and in fact such payments distorted the operation of the WEM; there was no document justifying economically that the payment had to be 10 US dollars and to remain at that level; if capacity payments were to defray capital costs, they should have been detached from dispatch, which was not what happened in the past decade.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply on the Merits [hereinafter Reply] of 26 November 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 99-108.\n\n72.\n\nThe alleged link between the reduction of capacity payments and the lack of investments after 2001 was also belied by the fact that the last decision to invest in the field of power generation was taken in 1996, five years before the crisis, when capacity payments still amounted to 10 US dollars/MWh.\n\n73.\n\nAccordingly, the decline of investments in power generation resulted from the performance of the economy as such and, more specifically, from the conditions of the energy market, explained by the crisis of emerging economies followed by the economic crisis of Argentina in 2001. Thus, it cannot be maintained that, despite the crisis, the electricity market would have continued to receive investments if the capacity payments had remained at the same level.\n\n***3. Hydrocarbon Regulatory Framework***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nInitially, the hydrocarbon trade in Argentina was governed by Law No. 17,319 of 1967, which allowed for the grant of concessions to private businesses. Until 1990, this possibility was not used, however, and the near-totality of crude oil and gas production remained in the hands of Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales (YPF), a State company.\n\n75.\n\nThis changed in 1989 with the adoption of a privatisation programme, which brought many changes and offered private entrepreneurs the opportunity to conduct activities in new, unexplored areas as well as in areas formerly exploited by YPF. Deregulation was implemented by a series of legislative acts, including Decrees Nos. 1055/1989 of 10 October 1989, 1212/1989 of 8 November 1989 and 1589/1989 of 27 December 1989.\n\n76.\n\nThese acts removed import and export restrictions on crude oil, and abolished withholdings and duties. At the end of 1991, the domestic oil industry was deregulated, including prices, and at the beginning of 1994 natural gas prices were deregulated as well.\n\n77.\n\nThe centre-piece of the de-regulation process was the right \"freely to dispose\" of extracted resources, on domestic and foreign markets, and the exemption from export duties or withholdings.\n\n78.\n\nAdditional regulation in the hydrocarbon sector included Decree No. 2411/1991 (\"Reconversion Decree\"), Decree No. 2178/1991, as amended by Decree No. 1271/1992 (\"Plan Argentina\"), Law No. 24,076 (\"Gas Law\") and implementing Decree No. 1738/1992. These texts, together with those cited above in paragraph 75, formed the \"Hydrocarbon Regulatory Framework.\"\n\n79.\n\nThe Gas Law made it possible to privatise \"Gas del Estado\" (GdE). Practically all of that company\u2019s assets were transferred to eight distribution and two transportation companies, a majority participation in each being sold to a consortium of private companies. These measures were intended to promote competition and to stimulate foreign investment in the oil and gas industry.\n\n80.\n\nRegarding incentives for obtaining investments, the following rights and advantages were offered to entities such as CAPSA/CAPEX: (i) the right to export crude oil without the GOA\u2019s prior approval; (ii) an exemption from fees and duties, except royalties; (iii) the right to negotiate hydrocarbon sales in the open market; (iv) the constitutional protection of investments as property or contractual rights, including those of CAPSA/CAPEX, for the sale of liquid hydrocarbons; (v) the duty, for the Federal Executive, to give twelve months\u2019 notice before restricting the export of crude oil, and the requirement that the producer receive a price not below that of similar, imported crude oil and petroleum products; and (vi) the freedom for producers to sell their production.\n\n***4. Argentina\u2019s Drive to Attract Foreign Investment***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nThe GOA made it clear that the new Energy Regulatory Framework was aimed at attracting investments, especially foreign investments. Argentina was prepared to provide certain guarantees to domestic and foreign investors. The privatisation policy in the energy sector was carried out, on the federal level, by the Executive and Legislative Powers which agreed that foreign investors were important to achieve privatisation successfully.\n\n82.\n\nThat result was reached by emphasising three principles - credibility, certainty and legal stability - the core requirement for attracting foreign investment being foreseeability, to be obtained especially through legal stability.\n\n83.\n\nThe privatisation drive of the Menem administration and its Energy Secretariat was supported by intergovernmental agencies such as the World Bank (IBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the UN Development Programme (UNDP), and the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) through loans and measures of technical assistance. This institutional support obviously encouraged private foreign investment.\n\n84.\n\nWith the help of its Energy Secretariat, of its Privatisation Under-Secretariat and the above-mentioned intergovernmental organisations, the GOA thus actively invited investments from abroad and, to that end, organised seminars and other promotional meetings (\"road shows\") in the United States, in Europe and in South-East Asia; at least part of them were financed by the UNDP. In these meetings, the new-found openness of Argentina\u2019s economy and the stability of the new investment framework were emphasised. Potential investors were led to assume that prices would be determined by market mechanisms and that costs and capacity payments be denominated in dollars.\n\n85.\n\nThe privatisation of the energy sector was successful. The electricity industry was modernised, power production almost doubled, and domestic demand rose by more than one half; equipment was renewed and upgraded; power and transmission failures became rare; and transmission lines for power export to Chile and Brazil were installed.\n\n86.\n\nThe same can be said of the hydrocarbon industry: crude oil and natural gas outputs rose by half or more, and so did the reserves of hydrocarbons. Despite the increase in production, the known natural gas reserves also rose by one third. Exports of crude oil grew from almost nothing to 15.6 million m3, and exports of natural gas from zero to about 9.3 million m3 per day. Energy exports now amounted to 13% of Argentina\u2019s total exports, the country thus being transformed from an energy importer into an exporter. The distribution network was improving as well, pipelines being installed to connect Argentina with Chile, Brazil and Uruguay.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant argued that the privatisation drive, the circumstances surrounding it and its consequences were evidence of the GOA\u2019s intention to establish a stable framework for attracting foreign investment to the energy sector, thereby raising legitimate expectations. This view was contested by the GOA which pointed out that, whatever efforts may have been deployed by it to develop the energy sector, such development, and the rights allegedly infringed, arose not from contracts but from Argentinian law. Law is not immutable, however, be it in the field of investment or elsewhere; and States are entitled, on the strength of their sovereignty, to change them. This is particularly true in emergency situations such as that in which Argentina found herself in 2001.12\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 407-428.\n\n88.\n\nAs pointed out earlier, in paragraph 57, another element in the GOA\u2019s investment strategy was the conclusion of some 50 BITs, among which was the Treaty with the United States of 14 November 1991. While such treaties are meant to cover investments of both sides, the 1991 BIT with the United States could, of course, have been viewed as an additional protection for investments to be made in the energy sector of Argentina.\n\nC. The Economic Crisis and the Measures Taken by Argentina in the Energy Sector\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Advent of the Crisis***\n---------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe years between 1991 and 1998 were good for Argentina. They brought a growth of the GDP averaging close to 6% and an important influx of capital. When deterioration began to set in, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) identified both external and internal causes therefore, including a sharp rise of the public debt from 1999 onward. This led to solvency problems which were aggravated by the rise of the US dollar and the drop of capital flows to developing market economies. Despite exceptional financial assistance by the IMF, confidence was not restored.\n\n90.\n\nBeginning in Spring of 2001, the GOA took a series of measures: elaboration of a plan to switch the convertibility regime from the dollar to a basket of US dollars and euros; tax-exemption measures to assist the economic sectors most affected by the recession; and a \"mega-swap\" of outstanding government bonds for instruments with longer periods of maturation. These measures had little effect: capital flight and deposit runs generated a partial deposit freeze. When Argentina failed to comply with the fiscal targets set, the IMF declined to make a payment for December 2001.\n\n91.\n\nAt the end of 2001, savings were massively withdrawn from the banks. In order to control the situation, the Government issued Decree No. 1570/01, known as *\"Corralito,\"* on 1 December 2001, restricting bank withdrawals and prohibiting any transfer of currency abroad. The situation led to demonstrations and tens of deaths in December 2001, and these, in turn, brought about the resignation of President de la R\u00faa on 20 December 2001. It can be noted that within a period of less than ten days, Argentina had a succession of five Presidents, who resigned one after the other. According to the GOA, \"Argentina seemed to be on the brink of anarchy and the abyss.\"13 The situation was indeed critical, and at the end of that month Argentina partly defaulted on its international obligations and abandoned the convertibility regime, replacing it by a dual exchange-rate system.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on the Merits [hereinafter Counter-Memorial] of 1 September 2006, \u00a7 7.\n\n92.\n\nArgentina\u2019s crisis of 2001-2002 resulted in a massive default regarding the public debt on the domestic as well as the international level. The real gross domestic product decreased by about 10% in 2002, the cumulative decline since 1998 amounting to 20%; and inflation rose to approximately 10% in April 2002, but eventually reached 40% for that entire year. More generally, due to the over-valuation of the peso and the deterioration in the economy\u2019s competitiveness, the Buenos Aires stock market lost more than 60% between 1998 and 2002; conversely, unemployment rose to over 20% in 2002. Fifty-four percent of the urban population now lived on the \"poverty level,\" while the population on an \"indigence level\" reached 25%; private consumption dropped by 20%. So alarming was the situation that the United Nations General Assembly resolved to reduce Argentina\u2019s membership dues on account of the crisis, which was the first case in history.\n\n93.\n\nThe above description is purely factual. The Arbitral Tribunal does not intend, at this stage, to go into the question of the inevitability of the crisis, to assign responsibility for it, or to decide on the applicability or otherwise of Article XI of the 1991 BIT to the measures taken by the GOA. These issues will be addressed later in this award \u00a7\u00a7 627-670.\n\n***2. The Measures Taken by Argentina: Overview***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe specific measures complained of by El Paso were adopted by Argentina in the context described above and were aimed at overcoming the crisis. Most of them were related, in one way or another, to the convertibility regime and its demise.\n\n95.\n\nA first measure consisted in freezing bank deposits and introducing foreign exchange controls. This was achieved, initially, by Decree No. 1570 of 1 December 2001, followed by the Public Emergency Law No. 25,561 of 6 January 2002 and by implementing measures. The Public Emergency Law: (i) abolished the parity of the US dollar and the peso; (ii) converted US dollar obligations into pesos at the rate of 1:1, a measure known as \"pesification\"; (iii) effected the conversion, on that basis, of dollar-denominated tariffs into pesos; (iv) eliminated adjustment clauses established in US dollars or other foreign currencies as well as indexation clauses or mechanisms for public service contracts, including tariffs for the distribution of electricity and natural gas; (v) required electricity and gas companies to continue to perform their public contracts; and (vi) authorised the GOA to impose withholdings on hydrocarbon exports.\n\n96.\n\nThese measures, according to the Claimant, turned the electric power sector into a strictly regulated industry operating with price caps and other requirements which made it difficult to earn a profit and even to retrieve investments. The Government, moreover, moved large sums of US dollars from the energy to the banking sector, which was particularly affected by the crisis, a measure which the Claimant considered discriminatory.14 To answer this contention, the respondent State pointed to the \"[t]he non-discrimination principle... [which] requires the State to treat equally investments that are in like situations,\"15 such situations arising within the same business or economic sector, and not among different sectors. But from El Paso\u2019s point of view, there was an intention to discriminate on the part of the State. However, from the Government\u2019s point of view, the discrimination must produce actual harm which the GOA did not assume to have occurred, and there were reasonable grounds for making the distinction complained of.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 223.\n\n*Champion Trading Company Ameritrade International Inc. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* [hereinafter *Champion Trading],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/9), Award of 27 October 2006, \u00a7 125.\n\n97.\n\nIt will now be convenient to turn to the specific measures taken in each of the two sectors examined in the present case.\n\n***3. The Electricity Sector***\n-------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nFollowing the enactment of the Public Emergency Law and of Decree No. 214/2002, CAMMESA resolved to pesify the Electricity Regulatory Framework and, with it, the contracts existing on 6 January 2002 and the transactions on the spot market after that date. By a series of resolutions, the GOA\u2019s Energy Secretariat then extended pesification to all values in that Framework. While under the latter, VCPs, capacity payments and other values had been calculated in US dollars, power generators now had to express their VCPs in pesos at an exchange rate of 1:1, which accounted for substantially lower spot prices; electric power export agreements were, however, excluded from pesification.\n\n99.\n\nThe same was to be done for calculating the fuel reference price which determined the maximum allowable variable price on the spot market. A price cap was established which, according to the Claimant,16 could prevent some participants from recuperating even their VCPs. This was why CAMMESA would now also dispatch producers whose VCPs were above the cap, these generators receiving the difference between that cap and the actual spot price. For generators such as CAPEX and Costanera, it no longer mattered whether they operated efficiently or not. Accordingly, the idea that the spot price would be the same for all generators, and be based on the costs incurred by the last generator dispatched, was abandoned; new price caps were imposed on the basis of new calculation methods applied by CAMMESA.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 235.\n\n100.\n\nAnother change concerned capacity payments: as reported earlier,17 these payments initially amounted to 5 US dollars, and had been increased to 10 US dollars per MWh, which was the amount at the time of the measures. Their calculation at the rate of one dollar to one peso amounted to a decrease to almost one third of their value. Later on, they were increased from 10 to 12 pesos, a sum which, at the relevant time, was roughly equivalent to 4 (instead of 10) US dollars.\n\nSee *supra* \u00a7\u00a7 67-73.\n\n101.\n\nRegarding the legality of the measures thus taken by the respondent State, the GOA pointed out that ever since the reform of the electricity sector, the agents of and participants in the WEM were to operate under the regulations issued by the Energy Department; participants in the market were aware of the risk of changes which, however, had to be in conformity with the guidelines set by the Electricity Law (No. 24,065). There were and had been continuous adjustments in the sector. According to the GOA, this shows that \"the legitimate expectations of any investor entering the market had to include the true possibility of changes and amendments to the Procedures.\"18\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 267-276.\n\n102.\n\nMoreover, according to the respondent State, the adjustments made were reasonable and allowed for adaptation to the new context. There was no reason to exclude the electricity industry from the pesification of the whole Argentine economy; nor was there any legal obstacle to the Energy Department\u2019s order to state costs in this or that currency. In addition, the Energy Department took account of the effect of the mega-devaluation of the peso on generators\u2019 costs. The adjustment of capacity payments was, as discussed earlier,19 appropriate, reasonable and consistent with a competitive market.\n\nSee *supra* \u00a7\u00a7 67-73.\n\n103.\n\nThe GOA further argued that the measures taken by the Energy Department to calculate spot prices were not exceptional: (a) because the exclusion of certain machines from the spot-price calculation was practised during as well as prior to the crisis; (b) because there always were price caps in the spot market; and (c) because the replacement of the formula \"reference prices + 15%,\" substituted by that of generators\u2019 actual costs, was intended to protect producers.\n\n104.\n\nFinally, CAPEX and Costanera had agreed to the measures later objected to by El Paso. In 2002 and 2003, before the sale of the holdings in the Argentinian companies, CAPEX challenged some of the measures taken by the respondent State. These challenges were dismissed in the federal court of Argentina, and these decisions were not appealed by CAPEX. A further challenge became moot when CAPEX - voluntarily according to the GOA - resolved, together with most participants in the WEM, to participate in the FONINVEMEM, a system created by the GOA to normalise the service and to make the necessary investment in power generation. \"El Paso cannot contradict the own acts of the companies on behalf of which it is claiming.\"20 The Claimant objected that the local companies\u2019 consent did not bind it and that these companies had acted under duress.21\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 267-325; RPHB, \u00a7\u00a7 5-7, 9-14.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief [hereinafter CPHB] of 2 August 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 105-114, 122-129.\n\n***4. The Hydrocarbon Sector***\n-------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nAs indicated in paragraph 95, export withholdings were imposed on the hydrocarbons sector to compensate the banking sector for the imbalance generated by the mandatory conversion of dollar-denominated deposits and credits *as per* Decree 310/2002 of 13 February 2002.\n\n106.\n\nDecree No. 310/2002 prescribed a 20% withholding on crude oil and LPG exports, according to El Paso, or 16.67% according to Argentina,22 the withholding on the latter being subsequently reduced to 5%23 according to El Paso, or 4.76 according to Argentina.24 On 13 May 2002, the Government raised export withholdings on crude oil and LPG to 25% and 20%, respectively. In August 2004, additional withholdings on crude oil, on a sliding scale, were decreed for the event that the crude oil price would reach or exceed a certain level. Such withholdings affected hydrocarbons sales abroad and depressed domestic prices by increasing the local availability of such products.25 It must be added here that CAPEX requested and obtained, from Argentina\u2019s federal courts, a preliminary injunction suspending the restrictions on exports, and that the latter were subsequently repealed by the GOA\u2019s Secretary of Energy.26\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 200-201.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 330.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 202-208.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 200-202; Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 196-222; Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 246-288; RPHB, \u00a7\u00a7 52-55.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 246-252; RPHB, \u00a7\u00a7 17-18.\n\n107.\n\nSome withholding measures seem to have persisted for a long time, CAPSA\u2019s and CAPEX\u2019s revenues suffering as a result on both the international and domestic levels, until El Paso, in 2003, sold its shares in the Argentinian companies (on this issue, see below, paragraphs 114-120).\n\n108.\n\nAnother measure taken in the Hydrocarbon Sector was, of course, the pesification of contracts under the Public Emergency Law and Decree No. 214/2002, *i.e.* of the existing dollar-denominated obligations and claims, at the rate of 1:1. That measure had, in particular, a negative impact on CAPSA\u2019s and CAPEX\u2019s dollar-denominated crude oil sales and purchase contracts. Regarding liquid hydrocarbons, the Public Emergency Law obliged the parties to existing sales contracts to re-negotiate them, and the two companies had to accept price reductions. Agreements for the transportation of natural gas for export were not, however, affected by pesification.\n\n109.\n\nTo insulate domestic consumers from the rise of the price of crude oil on the international market, the GOA directed producers and refiners to enter into special sales agreements. This was done and there were, according to the respondent State, over 20 such agreements executed by it and El Paso\u2019s Argentinian companies. As it had done for the electricity sector,27 the GOA highlighted that fact to show that the measures taken by it had been acquiesced in by the companies.28 Again the Claimant challenged the argument mainly by asserting that the companies\u2019 consent did not engage El Paso, their foreign shareholder, and that the agreements were concluded under duress.29 As of 1 January 2003, the reference sales price from producers to refiners was 28.50 US dollars. The barrel price of crude oil in the world market was, however, significantly higher and has risen further since then. For the depressed price prescribed, the producers were to be compensated by the refiners should the world market price remain above 28.50 US dollars for a long time, though a cap was set at 36 US dollars per barrel, which limited the duty to compensate. Nothing happened, however, and no compensation was paid.\n\nSee *supra* \u00a7 103.\n\nRPHB, \u00a7\u00a7 1-9.\n\nCPHB, \u00a7\u00a7 105-114, 122-129.\n\n110.\n\nThe measures taken in the hydrocarbon sector spawned, among the parties, much the same discussions and controversies as over the electricity sector. These arguments, having been summarised above in paragraphs 101-104, do not need to be repeated here.\n\n***5. The Tax Depreciation Issues***\n------------------------------------\n\n111.\n\nWith the depreciation of investments a tax issue arose. Under Argentina\u2019s Income Tax Law, assets were depreciated annually by prorating them according to their estimated life expectancy. The Public Emergency Law repealed the Convertibility Law, and the GOA took measures causing both a devaluation of the peso and inflation, thus reducing the amount of permissible depreciation and decreasing the tax relief the Argentinian companies could claim.\n\n112.\n\nRegarding the losses suffered by hydrocarbon producers and investors, the Public Emergency Law provided that losses resulting from the new exchange rate which affected dollar-denominated liabilities could only be deducted in five yearly instalments of 20%.\n\n***6. The Energy Crisis in Argentina***\n---------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe above-described measures, prompted by the 2001-2002 crisis, resulted in depressed electricity and gas prices, which brought increased consumption. These prices, together with the reduction of capacity payments, dissuaded generators of electricity from investing in new power plants, and gas producers from exploring and drilling for further resources. As a consequence, shortages were likely and did in fact occur.\n\nD. The Sale of the Claimant\u2019s Shares in the Argentinian Companies\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nAccording to El Paso, the sale of its investment in the Argentinian companies was due to the destruction of their value by the measures of the GOA and their lack of prospects.30 The respondent State pointed out, however, that the sale was a consequence, not of its own conduct, but of a decision made by El Paso to concentrate on its core business world-wide in order to improve its liquidity,31 which had suffered through inadequate policies pursued by the Claimant.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 37-43.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 263; RPHB, \u00a7 63.\n\n115.\n\nThe first phase of the sale took place on 23 June 2003. El Paso sold its interest in CAPSA (45%) (and, consequently, in CAPEX) to Wild SA, the majority shareholder of CAPSA, for 24 million US dollars. The transaction was made contingent on a stock swap with CAPEX International Business Co. (CIBCO), an entity controlled by CAPSA, by which El Paso transferred to CIBCO its interest in SERVICIOS in exchange for CIBCO\u2019s 38.4% interest in Triunion, another company of the El Paso group.\n\n116.\n\nThe second phase occurred on 3 October 2003: El Paso sold its interest in Costanera (12,335%) to Empresa Nacional de Electricidad, a Chilean company, for a cash price of 4.5 million US dollars.\n\n117.\n\nThe respondent State alleged that the sale was prompted by reasons alien to the Argentinian crisis.32 It was, moreover, an unwise move, for while El Paso had purchased its investment at a time when the Argentinian economy had reached a peak, it sold that investment when the economy hit bottom. To borrow from the GOA\u2019s colourful language, El Paso bought its investment \"at the sound of the trumpets\" and sold it \"at the sound of the cannons.\"33\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 61-89; RPHB, \u00a7 217.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 38; RPHB, \u00a7 217.\n\n118.\n\nIn reply, the Claimant asserted that the sale resulted from the Argentinian crisis, the measures taken by the respondent State, the uncertainty generated by them, and reasons of good and prudent stewardship.34\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 37-46.\n\n119.\n\nThe respondent State also expressed doubts about the 24 million US dollars collected by El Paso.35 That was the sum paid by Wild to EPEC, a company fully owned by El Paso and, also, holding 45% of CAPSA\u2019s shares on behalf of El Paso. Of these 45%, 38.5% went to Wild (via EPEC) for the above-mentioned sum of 24 million US dollars; the remaining 6.5% was handed over to Deutsche Bank for 14.1 million US dollars. This caused the GOA to doubt the reality of the price charged to Wild, the price paid by Deutsche Bank being 400% higher.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 97-99; Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 60-71.\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimant explained that the 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares went to Deutsche Bank, not on the basis of a sale of stock but as a guarantee for a loan of 14 million US dollars extended by the Bank to enable Wild to buy CAPSA\u2019s shares.36 In other words, the transaction questioned by the GOA was not a straightforward sale but a loan agreement guaranteed by a security. What determined the amount paid to Deutsche Bank was not the value of the shares but the amount of the loan.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 385-396.\n\nE. The Final Submissions of the Parties\n---------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe final submissions of the Claimant read as follows:37\n\n\"For the reasons stated herein, in its Memorials, and at the hearing, Claimant respectfully requests an award granting it the following relief:\n\n1. A finding and declaration that the Argentine Republic violated the BIT;\n\n2. An order that the Argentine Republic compensate Claimant for all damages it has suffered, plus interest compounded quarterly until the date of payment, and\n\n3. An order that the Argentine Republic pay the costs of these proceedings, including the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses, the cost of Claimant\u2019s legal representation, and other costs.\"\n\nCPHB, \u00a7 186.\n\n122.\n\nThe respondent State\u2019s final submissions were the following:38\n\n\"Based on the arguments and evidence of the case, the Argentine Republic hereby requests this Tribunal to dismiss Claimant\u2019s claim in all its aspects and to require Claimant to pay for all the expenses and legal costs deriving from this arbitration.\"\n\nRPHB, \u00a7 232.\n\n**III. LEGAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------\n\nA. Applicable law\n-----------------\n\n***1. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n123.\n\nUnder the first sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, \"the Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules as may be agreed by the Parties.\" Since the Parties consented to arbitrate the dispute under the 1991 BIT, the latter, as interpreted and applied in accordance with general principles of international law, constitutes the \"rules of law\" to which the parties \"agreed.\" Customary international law, which is explicitly incorporated by the BIT in its provisions, has a double role: (1) to clarify the terms of the BIT; and (2) to establish a floor for the treatment of investments.\n\n124.\n\nThe BIT and international law are also governing under the second sentence of Article 42(1), which provides that the Tribunal \"shall apply the law of the Contracting State Party to the dispute... and such rules of international law that may be applicable.\" In fact, Argentina has incorporated the BIT and international law into its domestic law and the second sentence creates a duty to apply international law. Argentinian law is irrelevant for determining whether Argentina is internationally liable for its conduct, the role of such law being to \"inform the content of commitments\" made by Argentina to the Claimant.\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimant relies on a certain number of decisions of ICSID tribunals on the subject, including the decision adopted on 3 July 2002 by the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi Universal v. Argentina,* stating that:\n\n\"... the inquiry which the ICSID tribunal is required to undertake is one governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law. Such an inquiry is neither in principle determined, nor precluded, by any issue of municipal law, including any municipal law agreement of the parties.\"39\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA. and Vivendi Universal SA. v. Argentine Republic* [hereinafter *Vivendi Annulment],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), First Decision on Annulment of 3 July 2002, \u00a7 102.\n\n*(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nArgentina asserts that \"there is no agreement between Argentina and El Paso with respect to the law governing the dispute.\" The fact that the agreement between States is regulated by international law is not related to the law applicable to a dispute in which such an agreement should be applied. Whenever a treaty provides that in a specific dispute the provision of such treaty and domestic law will be applied, domestic legislation is considered to be \"law\" (and not a \"fact\"), applicable on the same level as international law (unless otherwise stated).\n\n127.\n\nTo decide whether Argentina is internationally responsible under the BIT, the rights that El Paso would allegedly have acquired under Argentina law have to be determined under such law, this being the legal system to which the investor has voluntarily become subject. It is not enough for the Claimant to establish that Argentina violated legal or contractual provisions, it must also show that its behaviour implied a violation of the BIT. As stated in the Decision on Jurisdiction, purely contractual claims not amounting to claims for violation of the BIT cannot be entertained.\n\n***2. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nDespite the diverging views expressed by the Parties, both have extensively relied on the BIT, international law and Argentinian law in support of their respective claims and defences. Argentina is right when calling attention to the circumstance that in the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the law governing the dispute, under Article 42(1), second sentence, of the ICSID Convention both the law of Argentina and international law are applicable. The Claimant is also right in emphasising the relevance of the BIT and international law, given the nature of the claims involved in the dispute.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the view that both systems - the BIT supplemented by international law as well as Argentinian law - have a role to play. The issue is to determine the role of each system for the decision on the merits, given the context of a dispute arising under an investment treaty. The advent of treaty arbitration has brought about a departure from the typical situation where the contract between the investor and the host State is the basis for the consent to ICSID jurisdiction. The basis for consent in treaty arbitration is the treaty itself, in our case the BIT, such consent covering as a rule only claims arising under the BIT (\"treaty claims,\" as opposed to \"contract claims\"). The specific context characterising treaty arbitration permits in our case to define the role of the BIT and international law, on the one hand, and Argentina law, on the other.\n\n130.\n\nThe Claimant relies on Argentina\u2019s responsibility for the violation of various provisions of the BIT. According to the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,40 \"every internationally wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of the State.\" (Article 1) Further, \"the characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.\" (Article 3) Accordingly, the primary governing law in this case is the BIT, supplemented by international law to which the BIT itself makes reference in various provisions.\n\n*Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,* 2001 [hereinafter ILC Articles], (text adopted by the International Law Commission (ILC) at its fifty-third session, in 2001, and submitted to the General Assembly as a part of the Commission\u2019s Report. The Report, which also contains commentaries on the Draft Articles, appears in *Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* 2001, Vol. II (Part Two)). Text reproduced as it appears in the annex to General Assembly Resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001, and corrected by document A/56/49(Vol. I)/Corr.4.),available at: http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/draft%20articles/9\\_6\\_2001.pdf\n\n131.\n\nThe application of the treaty as the prevailing source as well as the national law of the host State in the case of a dispute under a bilateral investment treaty has been upheld by various ICSID tribunals which have also noted the relation of the treaty to the law of the host State. In *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd v. Sri Lanka,*41 the ICSID tribunal noted that\n\n\"the prior choice-of-law referred to in the first part of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention could hardly be envisaged in the context of an arbitration case directly instituted in implementation of an international obligation undertaken between two States in favour of their respective nationals investing within the territory of the other Contracting State.\"42\n\nAccordingly, the tribunal noted that both Parties acted in a manner that demonstrated their mutual agreement that the Sri Lanka-UK BIT be the primary source of the applicable legal rules and concluded that the Sri Lanka-UK BIT, as *lex specialis,* provides the applicable law in the case of a British (Hong Kong) national asserting violations of that treaty by the Sri Lanka Government. The tribunal added, however, that the agreement of the parties on the application of the BIT did not exclude the application of other rules, as\n\n\"the Bilateral Investment Treaty is not a self-contained closed legal system limited to provide for substantive material rules of direct applicability, but has to be envisaged within a wider juridical context in which rules from other sources are integrated through implied incorporation methods, or by direct reference to certain supplementary rules, whether of national law character or of domestic law nature.\"43\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Ltd v. Sri Lanka* [hereinafter *AAPL]* (ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3), Award of 27 June 1990.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 19.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 21.\n\n132.\n\nThe ICSID tribunal in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Costa Rica* concluded that Costa Rican law was \"generally consistent with the accepted principles of public international law on the same subject,\" noting that \"[t]o the extent that there may be any inconsistency between the two bodies of law, the rules of public international law must prevail.\"44 In *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* the Annulment Committee stated the following:\n\n\"What is clear is that the sense and meaning of the negotiation leading to the second sentence of Article 42(1) allowed for both legal orders to have a role. The law of the host State can indeed be applied in conjunction with international law if this is justified. So too international law can be applied by itself if the appropriate rule is found in this other ambit.\"45\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarollo de Santa Elena SA. v. Costa Rica* [hereinafter *Santa Elena]* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award of 17 February 2000, \u00a7 64.\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* [hereinafter *Wena],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Decision on Annulment of 5 February 2002, \u00a7 40.\n\n133.\n\nThe Committee then affirmed the original tribunal\u2019s reliance on the Egypt-UK BIT as the primary governing law, stating: \"This treaty law and practice evidences that when a tribunal applies the law embodied in a treaty to which Egypt is a party it is not applying rules alien to the domestic legal system of this country.46\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 44.\n\n134.\n\nAuthoritative scholars have expressed the same view. Thus, Professor Prosper Weil has observed:\n\n\"Even where the investment instrument - be it a contract or a unilateral act - provides that the relationship between the host State and the foreign investor is entirely or partly subject to the domestic law of the host State, the existence of a Bilateral Investment Treaty raises the question of compliance with the rights and obligations contained therein to the level of a matter under international law, with respect not only to relations between the States parties to the treaty but also to relations between the host State and the investor.\"47\n\nProsper Weil, \"The State, the Foreign Investor, and International Law: The No Longer Stormy Relationship of a M\u00e9nage \u00e0 Trois\", 15 *ICSID Rev. - Foreign Inv IL. J.* 401, 411 -412 (2000).\n\n135.\n\nThe fact that the BIT and international law govern the issue of Argentina\u2019s responsibility for violation of the treaty does not exclude that the domestic law of Argentina has a role to play too. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that this role is to inform the content of those commitments made by Argentina to Claimant that the latter alleges to have been violated. Thus, in order to establish which rights have been recognised by Argentina to the Claimant as a foreign investor, resort will have to be had to Argentina\u2019s law. However, whether a modification or cancellation of such rights, even if legally valid under Argentina\u2019s law, constitutes a violation of a protection guaranteed by the BIT is a matter to be decided solely on the basis of the BIT itself and the other applicable rules of international law.\n\n136.\n\nThe above approach, according to which the BIT and international law as well as Argentinian law have to be applied, is consistent with decisions of ICSID tribunals and annulment committees in disputes involving Argentina under the same BIT. Thus, in *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,48* the tribunal, referring to the passage of the Annulment Committee in the *Wena* decision quoted above in paragraph 132, held:\n\n\"This is the approach this Tribunal considers justified when taking the facts of the case and the arguments of the parties into account. Indeed, there is here a close interaction between the legislation and the regulations governing the gas privatization, the Licenses and international law, as embodied both in the Treaty and in customary international law. All of these rules are inseparable and will, to the extent justified, be applied by the Tribunal.\"49\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. The Argentine Republic* [hereinafter CMS], (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of 12 May 2005, \u00a7 117. See also Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of 17 July 2003 and Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of 25 September 2007.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 117.\n\n137.\n\nIn*Azurix Corporation v. Argentine Republic,* the tribunal stated:\n\n\"Azurix\u2019s claim has been advanced under the BIT and, as stated by the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi II,* the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry is governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law. While the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry will be guided by this statement, this does not mean that the law of Argentina should be disregarded. On the contrary, the law of Argentina should be helpful in the carrying out of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement to which Argentina\u2019s law applies, but it is only an element of the inquiry because of the treaty nature of the claims under consideration.\"50\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. The Argentine Republic* [hereinafter Azurix], (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award of 14 July 2006, \u00a7 67.\n\n138.\n\nIn *LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic,* the tribunal held:\n\n\"The fact that there is no contract between the Argentine Republic and LG&E favours in the first place the application of international law, inasmuch as we are dealing with a genuine dispute in matters of investment which is especially subject to the provisions of the Bilateral Treaty complemented by the domestic law.\"51\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* [hereinafter *LG&E\\,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability of 3 October 2006, \u00a7 98.\n\n139.\n\nIn *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets EP. v. Argentine Republic,* the tribunal had this to say:\n\n\"While on occasion writers and decisions have tended to consider the application of domestic law or international law as a kind of dichotomy, this is far from being the case. In fact, both have a complementary role to perform and this has begun to be recognised.\n\nIt must be noted also that the very legal system of treaties of the Argentine Republic, like many modem systems, provides for a prominent role of treaties under both Article 27 and 31 of the Constitution. Treaties are constitutionally recognized among the sources considered \u2018the supreme law of the Nation.\u2019 It follows that in case of conflict between a treaty rule and an inconsistent rule of domestic law, the former will prevail.\"52\n\n*Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets L.P. v. Argentine Republic* [hereinafter *Enron],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Award of 22 May 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 207-208.\n\n140.\n\nIn *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic,53* the arbitral tribunal has held that the role of Argentinian law is not limited to the determination of factual questions and has a broader role to play,54 but that international law holds a prominent role, both Parties having invoked it in respect of a number of matters.55 In case of inconsistency between Argentinian law and international law, the latter shall prevail.56 The tribunal has then concluded that:\n\n\"In accordance with the above considerations, the Tribunal will consider both Argentine law and international law to the extent each is relevant to a determination on liability.\"57\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic* [hereinafter *Sempra],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16), Award of 28 September 2007.\n\n*Ibid., \u00a7 235.*\n\n*Ibid., \u00a7* 236.\n\n*Ibid., \u00a7\u00a7* 237-238.\n\n*Ibid., \u00a7* 240.\n\n141.\n\nAccordingly, this Tribunal will apply to the merits of the case the BIT and international law, when applicable, as well as the Argentinian law, each in its role as defined above.\n\nB. Definition of the Investment\n-------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nIt is well known that in order to qualify for protection under the ICSID/BIT mechanism, an investment has to satisfy the requirements of the definition of an investment both under the Washington Convention and the BIT. Although there is no definition of an \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention, case-law has emerged to allow for determination of what constitutes an investment. One of the central purposes of ICSID arbitration is the protection of foreign investments. In order for this Tribunal to entertain a claim, the latter must be related to a legal dispute arising directly out of an investment. The existence of an investment is therefore an essential requirement, and the Tribunal will ascertain what the substance of the protected investment is in this case.\n\n***1. Introduction***\n---------------------\n\n143.\n\nArticle 1(1)(a) of the BIT provides:\n\n\"For the purposes of this Treaty,\n\n(a) \u2018investment\u2019 means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt and service and investment contracts; and includes without limitation:\n\n(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights such as mortgages, liens and pledges;\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in the assets thereof;\n\n(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value and directly related to an investment;\n\n(iv) intellectual property which includes, *inter alia,* rights relating to:\n\nliterary and artistic works, including sound recordings,\n\ninventions in all fields of human endeavour, industrial designs,semiconductor mask works, trade secrets, know-how, and confidential business information, and\n\ntrademarks, service marks, and trade names; and\n\n(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law.\"\n\n144.\n\nThe question to be answered is that of the extent of the \"investment\" or \"investments\" made by the Claimant, *i.e.* whether the rights protected by the BIT are limited to those pertaining to the shares held by the Claimant in the Argentinian companies, or whether they include other items, such as legal and contractual rights belonging to the Argentinian companies. The Parties disagree on this issue. Before examining the matter and expressing the present Tribunal\u2019s views thereon, it may be convenient to recall that in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal rejected, *inter alia,* an objection of the Respondent to the effect that the Claimant lacked *jus standi.58*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction of 27 April 2006 [hereinafter Decision on Jurisdiction], \u00a7 139.\n\n145.\n\nThat objection had been based on two arguments: (i) the investments in question had been sold by the Claimant, and claimants must retain their investor\u2019s status throughout the examination of their claim; and (ii) the Claimant had but a minority shareholding in the Argentinian companies.\n\n146.\n\nRegarding the first argument, the Tribunal found that no rule prescribing continuous ownership of the investment could be deduced from the ICSID Convention and the BIT or from the relevant case-law.59 All that was required was ownership of the claim at the time of consent to arbitration as well as at the time of the registration of the claim, and these conditions were met in the instant case.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 135.\n\n147.\n\nAs to the second argument, the Arbitral Tribunal considered that it had been presented too late. But even if it had been timely, pursued the Tribunal, it would have been of little help to the Respondent for reasons similar to those mentioned by the Decision on Jurisdiction in *LG&E60* In that decision it is said that foreign claimants\u2019 shares in local companies \"are the investment within the meaning of Article 1 (1)(a)(ii) of the Bilateral Treaty\"61 and that \"it is irrelevant whether the shares are majority or minority shares.\"62\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, Decision on Jurisdiction of 30 April 2004.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 50.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n148.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal recognised the *jus standi* of the Claimant. It remains to be seen, on the merits of the present case, what exactly the Claimant\u2019s investment consists of: the shares of the Argentinian companies only or other elements as well?\n\n***2. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n149.\n\nIn its Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant asserts that the term \"investment\" used in the BIT between Argentina and the United States includes elements other than shareholdings.63 That term must be read as including not only shareholders\u2019 rights, but also investment contracts and legal or contractual rights owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the investor. This means, according to the Claimant, that since CAPSA and CAPEX were\n\n\"... the investment vehicles through which El Paso invested in Argentina\u2019s hydrocarbon sector, the vested and contractual rights belonging to those entities indirectly belonged to El Paso within the terms of this Treaty [the BIT].\"64\n\nCPHB, \u00a7 57.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 104.\n\n150.\n\nMoreover, according to the Claimant,\n\n\"... the actions of the local operating companies - whether they choose to enter into settlement agreements, renegotiations, or seek relief in local courts - cannot waive the rights of a shareholding investor (minority or majority) under an applicable treaty; only the investor can give its consent to waive such rights.\"65\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 114.\n\n151.\n\nThe above views are confirmed by the experts commissioned by the Claimant and their testimony in this Tribunal\u2019s hearings. Thus, in his Opinion of August 2004, Professor Reisman stated:\n\n\"... in addition to the expropriation of specific contract and legal rights and frustration of legitimate expectations that resulted from the measures taken..., the cumulative effect of the measures... accomplished an indirect expropriation of El Paso\u2019s investment.\"66\n\n*Expert Opinion of Professor W. Michael Reisman* [hereinafter Reisman Report] of August 2004, p. 50, Memorial Legal Authority No. 29.\n\n152.\n\nIn the present context, what is of interest in the above passage is not so much what it says about expropriation, but the fact that \"it includes specific contract and legal rights\" of the Argentinian companies within El Paso\u2019s investment and, hence, in the object of the alleged expropriation. This view is confirmed by an exchange that took place between the expert and counsel for the respondent State during the hearing on the merits:\n\n\"Q. Were the legal and contractual rights of the Argentine companies El Paso\u2019s investment?\n\nA. Yes.\"67\n\nA few moments later, the following dialogue between counsel for Argentina and Professor Reisman was recorded:\n\n\"Q.... Now, under the definition of investments in the bilateral investment treaty, in addition to the shares that El Paso had in the Argentine companies, would the specific contractual and legal rights held by those companies with the government qualify as protected investments under the treaty?\n\nA. In my opinion it would.\n\nQ. And in your view are specific legal and contractual rights susceptible to expropriation independent from the business of the company as a whole?\n\nA. Of course. It\u2019s such an obvious point that I needn\u2019t try to give examples, but there are some.\"68\n\nHearing on the Merits, 4 through 13 June 2007 [hereinafter Hearing Transcript in English], Day 3, p. 784.\n\n*Ibid.,* pp. 808-809.\n\n153.\n\nThese views were confirmed by Professor Schreuer, another expert consulted by the Claimant.69 In his Opinion, Professor Schreuer asserted that Argentina had abrogated essential rights of the Claimant resulting from the latter\u2019s investment by taking, not physical assets but rights under the Electricity and Hydrocarbon Regulatory Frameworks - rights guaranteed by laws, decrees, resolutions and concession agreements - thereby depriving El Paso of a reasonably expected economic return.70 This expert later asserted\n\n\"... that specific rights that El Paso enjoyed under the Electricity and Hydrocarbons Regulatory Frameworks are covered by the definition of investment in the BIT and that these rights were taken from El Paso. This means that any \u2018right conferred by law or contract\u2019 upon El Paso is protected by the BIT.\"71\n\n*Legal Opinion of Christoph Schreuer, The Question of Breaches of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Argentina and the United States of America* [hereinafter C. Schreuer Report] of 3 November 2006, Reply Exhibit No. 254.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 89, p. 30.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 143, pp. 48-49.\n\n154.\n\nA confirmation of the above may be found in the conclusions of Professor Schreuer\u2019s Opinion:\n\n\"The term \u2018investment\u2019 is defined in Article 1(1) of the BIT. That definition includes \u2018a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value and directly related to an investment\u2019 as well as \u2018any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law.\u2019 Therefore, contracts and public concessions are included in the definition of investments. This also squarely covers the rights enjoyed by El Paso under the Electricity Regulatory Framework and under the Hydrocarbons Regulatory Framework. It follows that the rights of El Paso under the Electricity Regulatory Framework and under the Hydrocarbons Regulatory Framework as well as the rights arising under permits and contracts based on these legal frameworks are covered by the BIT\u2019s provisions protecting United States investors from expropriation and measures tantamount to expropriation.\"72\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 487, p. 159.\n\n155.\n\nIn his testimony before the Tribunal, Professor Schreuer was asked whether he would be surprised if he were told that the Regulatory Frameworks for Electricity and for Hydrocarbons do not grant any rights to El Paso. Here is the expert\u2019s answer:\n\n\"Yes, I would be, unless you mean \u2018directly,\u2019 of course. If you mean they granted rights to the Argentinian Companies in which El Paso invested, then I would not be surprised; but, if you say it did not grant any directly or indirectly, then I would be surprised.\"73\n\nHearing Transcript in English, Day 6, pp. 1709-1710.\n\n156.\n\nAll in all, the Claimant and its experts clearly are of the view that the expression \"investment\" used in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT between Argentina and the United States must be interpreted as including both El Paso\u2019s shares in the domestic companies and the contractual and legal rights directly owned by those entities.\n\n*(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s view is that the legal and contractual rights of the Argentinian companies belong to the latter and not to El Paso, a foreign entity that has invested in them. Accordingly, El Paso can claim for the loss allegedly caused unlawfully by the Respondent to its shares in said companies but not for allegedly unlawful damage caused to rights belonging to the latter. In its Rejoinder, the GOA asserts that\n\n\"the claim by the foreign investor whose investment is an interest in a local company may only be founded on the detriment to the investment itself when it is in breach of the BIT, rather than on the detriment to the local company\u2019s rights.\"74\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 342.\n\n158.\n\nSimilarly, in its Closing Statement, the GOA points out that\n\n\"[a] shareholder may not claim compensation in connection with a measure concerning the rights of the company where the shareholder holds a participating interest.\"75\n\nRPHB, \u00a7 11.\n\n159.\n\nThe Government\u2019s views on this issue were further developed by Professor Somarajah,76 one of its experts. His Opinion begins with the finding that the lack of diplomatic protection for foreign shareholders in local companies under the *Barcelona Traction* doctrine77 became increasingly cumbersome when developing countries targeting foreign investment began to require that such investment be made through domestic companies in which foreign shareholders would usually hold minority participations.78 This, according to the expert, is why some protection has been extended to foreign shareholders by the BITs.\n\n*Legal Opinion of M. Somarajah* attached to Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder [hereinafter Somarajah Report] of 5 March 2007.\n\n*Barcelona Power, Light and Traction Co., Ltd. (Belgium v. Spain)* (Second Phase) [hereinafter *Barcelona Traction},* Judgment of 5 February 1970.1.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 3.\n\nSomarajah Report, *supra* note 76.\n\n160.\n\nBut this protection, according to the same expert, will come to bear only if it is the shares as such which have been affected by measures such as forcible divestment or expropriation of the company; if the latter \"continued to function and the shares were intact, the need for such protection would not arise.\"79 The measures decided by the State thus were issues to be taken up on the domestic level by the company itself. Professor Somarajah then points out that\n\n\"[t]he mere fact that the shares had depleted in value does not give a cause of action to a minority shareholder under an investment treaty. Had the company been expropriated, the situation would have been different as the minority shareholder has a right to compensation for the extent of his share in the value of the company.\"80\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 8, p. 9.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n161.\n\nThe expert pursues his analysis by asserting that in international law the understanding always was that \"the shares in a company incorporated in a host country are not usually affected by any measures\" taken by that country. In such situations, the company itself is the victim. The domestic company as such does not have the personality required to seek protection under a BIT. This finding cannot be subverted merely by showing that the protected foreigners hold minority shareholdings. The situation is different when the company itself ceases to exist, in which case foreign shareholders can claim the value of their shares.81\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 9, p. 9.\n\n162.\n\nAccording to the *Barcelona Traction* ruling, customary international law does not allow for diplomatic protection by the national State of foreign shareholders. The change to this ruling brought about by the BITs is that shareholders are now given the possibility to protect shares, whether \"directly or indirectly held.\" This can be taken to mean: (i) that the intention was to protect the shares of majority shareholders and their value when the company was expropriated, especially in States making the entry of foreign investment dependent on local incorporation; and (ii) that there was no intention to protect shares of functioning companies.82\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 9,p. 10; \u00a7 16, p. 16.\n\n163.\n\nWhile it is true that the Tribunal recognised the *jus standi* of the Claimant as a minority shareholder in the Argentinian companies,83 this was a *prima facie* finding. The remaining question is whether \"the investment treaty protects shareholder rights beyond the protection of their rights as shareholders and includes the protection of the rights of the companies in which such shares are held.\"84\n\nSee *supra* \u00a7 148.\n\nSomarajah Report, *supra* note 76, \u00a7 10, p.ll.\n\n164.\n\nThe problem dealt with next by the Respondent\u2019s expert is whether *minority* shareholders qualify as owners of a \"protected investment\" under Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT. Such shareholders \"own and control\" their shares but not the company itself. Investments owned or controlled \"directly or indirectly,\" as referred to in Article 1.1 of the Treaty, is a term describing shares owned or controlled by their holders or someone higher up in the chain. It does not \"extend downward\" to the local company serving as a vehicle of the investment. The latter\u2019s property remains unprotected,85 and its assets cannot benefit from the diplomatic protection of the shareholders\u2019 national State. All the BIT aims for is to transfer the object of the diplomatic protection from the foreign State to the foreign individual investor; it does not enlarge the definition of the objects protected.86\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 17,p.17.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 17,p.18.\n\n165.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s expert then comments on views that contractual and legal rights of the domestic companies are not protected as rights of the latters\u2019 foreign shareholders.87 Wherever such claims were successful, this was because specific commitments had been made *directly* to the foreign investors guaranteeing these rights *via* permits or contracts. Such was the case in *CMS*88 where there was a license granted by decree, and in *Revere Copper v. Jamaica,*89 where a stabilisation contract \"involved a specific contractual commitment.\"90\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 11, p.12; \u00a7 12, pp.12-13; \u00a7 18, pp.18-19.\n\n*CMS,* Decision on Jurisdiction, *supra* note 48.\n\n*Revere Copper & Brass Incorporated, v. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC)* [hereinafter *Revere Copper v. OPIC},* AAA Award of 24 August 1978.\n\nSomarajah Report, *supra* note 76, \u00a7 18, p. 18, note 17.\n\n166.\n\nThe legal and contractual rights under discussion are based on Argentinian law, which brought them to life. Professor Somarajah points out that91 they are not enlarged at the international level but remain co-terminous with the rights as they stand on the domestic level: \"foreign investment rights under the investment treaty can exist only to the extent permitted by the host State\u2019s law at the time of the entry.\"92\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 19, pp. 19-20.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 19, p. 20.\n\n167.\n\nIt is, therefore, to Argentinian law that one must turn to establish whether specific rights have been attributed to the Claimant.93 In the case at hand, there were no such rights. Regarding the Electricity Sector,94 changes had to be expected and, in fact, frequently occurred; changes were foreseen in the Regulatory Framework and, indeed, were accepted voluntarily by the local companies; it was the foreign minority shareholders who complained. In the Hydrocarbons Sector,95 the situation is similar:\n\n\"... to the extent that the measures taken during the economic crisis are reasonable within the regulatory structure, they cannot create any impact or any external system of investment protection for a wrongful infringement of treaty rights.\"96\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 20, p. 21.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 21, pp. 21-23.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 22-25, pp. 23-26.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 23, p. 25.\n\n168.\n\nProfessor Sornarajah finally turns to the permanent sovereignty over natural resources, which he considers to be a principle of *jus cogens.* This means that, with the fluctuations of what can be considered as being the public interest, an element of paramount importance in this matter, the rights granted to operators and investors may fluctuate as well; entrants to the field cannot but be aware of that possibility. Pursuant to the *jus cogens* argument, what may have been possible at a given time under the angle of the *jus cogens* principle of permanent sovereignty over natural resources will no longer be at another point in time. In technical terms, this means that a supervening impossibility of performance may occur under Article 61 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.97 In such situations, the Respondent\u2019s expert concludes, \"a recovery of sovereignty is permissible.\"98 According to the Respondent\u2019s expert, all BITs are subject to that limitation.\n\nVienna Convention of the Law of Treaties [hereinafter Vienna Convention 1969] of 23 May 1969, United Nations Treaty Series, Vol. 1155, p. 331.\n\nSomarajah Report, *supra* note 76, \u00a7 25, p. 27.\n\n*(iii) A Summary of the Discussion*\n-----------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nEl Paso holds the view that it may claim, not only on the basis of its shareholdings in the Argentinian companies, but also based on the legal and contractual rights of those entities.\n\n170.\n\nThe respondent Government holds that the fundamental rules to be used to define the content of foreign shareholders\u2019 rights on the international level are those governing diplomatic protection. In principle, such protection can be granted to foreign shareholders only if their personal, *i.e.* direct, rights have suffered at the hands of the State: annulment or confiscation of its shares, refusal of the right to participate in shareholders\u2019 meetings or to receive a dividend, and so on. To this, one may add, at least for majority shareholders, the expropriation of the company, especially by States making the entry of foreign investment contingent on local incorporation. By contrast, shares of functioning companies remain unprotected.\n\n171.\n\nThis was, according to the Respondent, the situation prevailing up to the *Barcelona Traction* case.99 The only thing that changed with the advent of BITs is that, whereas in the past such claims had to be made through the channel of diplomatic protection, they can, today, be presented directly by the foreign investor. The BITs do not, however, enlarge the content of the rights protected in any way; they do not, in particular, extend to legal and contractual rights of domestic companies, except if specific commitments were made directly guaranteeing these rights to the foreign investor. Another point made was that minority shareholdings do not qualify for BIT protection.\n\n*Barcelona Traction, supra* note 77.\n\n172.\n\nThe above suggests that the two essential questions to be addressed by the Tribunal are: (i) Should Article I(1)(a) of the Argentina-US BIT be construed narrowly, as reflecting, so far as foreign shareholders\u2019 rights are concerned, the situation prevailing in the field of diplomatic protection? and (ii) Is the protection offered by that provision limited to foreign majority shareholders?\n\n***3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nIn the present case, El Paso\u2019s right to claim is not in dispute. Being an entity incorporated in the State of Delaware, it is unquestionably a US company and, thus, placed under ICSID jurisdiction pursuant to Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. What is in dispute is whether, in addition to El Paso\u2019s shares in the Argentinian companies, which the Parties agree qualify as \"investment\" according to Article I(1)(a) of the BIT, the term \"investments\" as defined by said Article includes other elements.\n\n174.\n\nEl Paso\u2019s basic contention is that Article I of the BIT between Argentina and the United States uses very broad language and can therefore encompass both its shareholdings in the Argentinian companies and the legal and contractual rights of which those entities had allegedly been deprived in violation of the BIT. This line of argument appears contradictory: either the domestic companies enjoy an independent legal existence, in which case it is they who own said legal and contractual rights, this meaning that the foreign investors\u2019 losses can be measured only by the diminished value of their shares in the companies. Or the domestic companies\u2019 legal existence is but a fiction, at least on the international level, and can therefore be disregarded, which would mean that the investment can practically be characterised as a direct one, the consequence being that the foreign investor may claim, as the owner of the local companies, the legal and contractual rights in question, but not its losses as a shareholder.\n\n175.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s eyes, the above two views are irreconcilable, so that it is indispensable to opt for the one or the other. As things are, the Claimant\u2019s contentions in their present form do not seem viable because they amount to claiming twice for damage caused by the same events: once for the taking of the rights of the Argentinian companies and once for the diminution in value of the shares of those companies held by El Paso. That the loss of share value is linked to the taking of the rights belonging to the local company appears obvious.\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s thesis appears flawed as well. It is based on the assumption that the only change from the *Barcelona Traction100* situation brought on by the BITs is that diplomatic protection will no longer be required because the individual foreign investor may now bring claims on the international level. Otherwise, it is argued, nothing has changed; in particular, the content of the claimable rights remains the same.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n177.\n\nTo remove any doubt and to ensure that its analysis is exhaustive, the Tribunal will first confirm that interests repeatedly invoked by the Claimant as having been interfered with are not investments protected by the BIT: this holds true for the licenses and other contracts granted to the Argentinian companies, as well as for purported investment agreements that would belong to El Paso. After this negative approach, the Tribunal will turn to a positive approach and concentrate on the definition of what does constitute El Paso\u2019s investment in Argentina, *i.e.* its shares in different Argentinian companies, thus giving an answer to the questions under paragraph 172 above. It seems however apposite, before entering into the analysis of the substance of El Paso\u2019s investment, to recall what the Claimant considers as its investment in its submissions. In its Memorial, El Paso\u2019s investment is described as follows, on the basis of Article I(1)(a) of the BIT:\n\n\"Applying these standards, Claimant\u2019s claims clearly arise directly out of an *\u2018investment.\u2019* Claimant\u2019s investment directly and indirectly include: (i) equity interests in the Argentine Companies; (ii) the ownership and control of legal rights under the Energy Regulatory Framework, including concession and contract rights, such as those arising under the Concessions and crude oil, LPG and energy supply agreements; (iii) a substantial amount of Dollars invested by Claimant in Argentina; and (iv) claims to money and performance having economic value under Claimant\u2019s Concession, contract and legal rights.\"101\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 57.\n\n***(i) What Is Not El Paso\u2019s Investment?***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Licenses and Other Contracts Granted to the Argentinian Companies Are Not Protected Investments*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nAlthough the Claimant has not asserted that the Argentinian companies as such are its investment, it has claimed violation of rights belonging to these companies and can therefore be considered to have implicitly considered the Argentinian companies either as protected investors or protected investments. The Tribunal therefore deems it necessary to clarify whether the Argentinian companies are or are not protected investors and whether the Claimant can therefore claim for rights belonging to them.\n\n179.\n\nIn its Article 25(2), the ICSID Convention gives a definition of the companies that can be considered nationals of a given State:\n\n\"... (2) \u2018National of another Contracting State\u2019 means:\n\n... (b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\"\n\n180.\n\nIn the BIT, Article I gives the following definition of a \"company\":\n\n\"b) \u2018company\u2019 of a Party means any kind of corporation, company, association, state enterprise, or other organization, legally constituted under the laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof whether or not organized for pecuniary gain, and whether privately or govemmentally owned.\"\n\n181.\n\nA first point can be dealt with quite quickly: it is not contested that CAPSA, CAPEX, Costanera and SERVICIOS are Argentinian companies under these definitions, as they are incorporated under the laws of Argentina and registered in that country.\n\n182.\n\nThe second question to be asked is whether, although they have the nationality of the Contracting State Party to the dispute - *i.e.* the nationality of Argentina - the Parties have agreed that, because of foreign control, these companies should be treated as United States nationals, and therefore their rights considered as protected investments, for the purposes of the ICSID Convention and this arbitration. It should be noted that Argentina has indeed agreed to treat the Argentinian Companies as foreign companies under Article VII(8) of the BIT for purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, on condition of a foreign (U.S.) control over such entities.\n\n183.\n\nFor Costanera, there is clearly no control, as El Paso holds only an indirect noncontrolling interest of about 12% in Costanera. The same is true for CAPSA and, through the latter, CAPEX, as there is no control by the American company El Paso over these two Argentinian entities: El Paso has only indirect non-controlling shareholdings in CAPSA and CAPEX; more precisely, El Paso owns a 45% interest in CAPSA, the latter having a 60.36% interest in CAPEX.102 The analysis is different for SERVICIOS: both the first condition for considering it as a foreign company - El Paso owned a 99.2 % controlling shareholding in that company - and the second condition - the agreement by Argentina to consider SERVICIOS as a US company because of control - are met. However, SERVICIOS has signed no contracts or other agreements with Argentina. The conclusion is that the rights of the four mentioned Argentinian companies in which El Paso has invested cannot be considered rights enjoying the protection of the Argentina-US BIT by application of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nThis amounts to a 28.06% indirect interest of El Paso in CAPEX.\n\n184.\n\nA similar situation was found to exist in CMS.103 That company was complaining about the treatment it received as a foreign investor during the Argentinian crisis, its investment being a minority shareholding in TGN (Transportadora de Gas del Norte), an Argentinian company to which the GOA had granted a concession for the transportation of natural gas. The Claimant, the Respondent and the Tribunal made the same analysis of the situation, considering that TGN was not a protected investor. The Respondent\u2019s position, as summarised by the tribunal in the Decision on Jurisdiction, was the following:\n\n\"In its view, while the acquisition of shares qualifies as an investment under the Treaty, neither TGN, as an Argentine corporation, nor the License qualify as an investment under the BIT. TGN, the argument follows, has its own assets, including the License; because these assets do not constitute an investment under the Treaty, CMS\u2019s claims, based on the alleged breach of TGN\u2019s rights under the License cannot be considered to arise directly from an investment.\"104\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 66.\n\n185.\n\nThe claimant did not disagree with this analysis, as highlighted again by the tribunal:\n\n\"CMS shares the view that TGN is not an investor under the Treaty, and that it has not been agreed to treat this company as a non-Argentine national because of foreign control. Neither is the License an investment under the Treaty. However, CMS adds, its 29.42% share in TGN qualifies as an investment covered under the Treaty...\"105\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 67.\n\n186.\n\nThe tribunal concluded along the same lines and accepted jurisdiction, not on the basis of any rights of TGN or any rights relating to the License, which were not protected investments, but on account of the existence of the shareholding of CMS in the Argentinian company:\n\n\"Because... the rights of the Claimant can be asserted independently from the rights of TGN and those relating to the License, and because the Claimant has a separate cause of action under the Treaty in connection with the protected investment, the Tribunal concludes that the present dispute arises directly from the investment made and that therefore there is no bar to the exercise of jurisdiction on this count.\"106\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 68.\n\n187.\n\nThe conclusion is therefore unavoidable: the Argentinian companies - CAPSA, CAPEX, Costanera and SERVICIOS - do not qualify as protected investors under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, and the Tribunal so holds.\n\n188.\n\nThe Argentinian companies not being protected investors, their rights and licenses cannot be considered protected investments. Throughout its submissions, the Claimant complains about interferences with \"its contractual rights.\" A few examples can be given: in its Memorial, it mentions that \"El Paso was stripped of legal and *contractual rights* and associated revenues.\"107 In its Reply, the Claimant asserts that the GOA interfered with electricity sale contracts \"[i]n violation of express provisions of the Electricity Law that guaranteed the right of generators to freely negotiated *contracts,*108 that it mandatorily converted \"all Dollar denominated payments in PPAs into Pesos at a confiscatory exchange rate,\"109 that \"the GOA unilaterally interfered with *contractual rights* arising from the *sale agreements,* contravening express assurances granted to CAPSA and CAPEX under the Hydrocarbon Deregulation Decrees and Decree N\u00b0 43/1991 that granted the CAPEX Concession\";110 also, as stated by the Claimant in the same submission, \"the currency conversion imposed by Law N\u00b0 25,561 and Decree N\u00b0 214 severely impacted CAPSA and CAPEX\u2019s contracto.\"111\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 31. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\nReply, \u00a7 112.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 238. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 246. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n189.\n\nHowever, this Tribunal considers that El Paso owns no contractual rights to be protected, as it has signed no contract with Argentina. In so doing, it agrees with the analysis of the tribunal in the *CMS* case, as evidenced by the references to the licenses in the citation from the Decision on Jurisdiction in paragraph 186. It is thus the conclusion of the Tribunal that none of the contracts the interference with which is complained of by the Claimant are protected investments under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n*(b) No Investment Agreement Protected by the BIT Was Entered into* *between Argentina and El Paso*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal considered that it could accept *prima facie* the contention of the Claimant that there might be some investment agreements in this case, although that notion is not defined in the BIT. It is worth mentioning that while the BIT involved here fails to supply a complete definition of \"investment agreements,\" the following definition of that notion has been given in BITs and free trade agreements concluded by the US since 1994:\n\n\"... a written agreement between the national authorities of a Party and a covered investment or a national or company of the other Party that (i) grants rights with respect to natural resources or other assets controlled by the national authorities and (ii) the investment, national or company relies upon in establishing or acquiring a covered investment.\"\n\n191.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the concessions granted to the Argentinian companies could be so characterised because they constitute written agreements between those companies and the Government; they grant the companies rights to natural resources belonging to the host State; and they establish investment obligations for the companies towards the Government. For example, in its Reply, the Claimant asserts that \"each of the Concessions qualifies as an \u2018investment agreement\u2019.\"112 According to the Respondent, on the contrary, \"[i]n the case under analysis, there is no investment agreement because the requirements for it to exist have not been met: (a) El Paso did not enter into an agreement with the Argentine Government; and (b) the concessions invoked by Claimant lack the elements that may internationalise them because they are governed by Argentine law, are subject to domestic courts and have been granted to Argentine Companies.\"113\n\nReply, \u00a7 613.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 302.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, considered that \"[a]ccording to this Tribunal, the Claimant has made out a *prima facie* case that there is indeed an investment agreement as that notion may be generally understood.\"114\n\n*CMS, supra* note 58, Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 114.\n\n193.\n\nAs the Tribunal is now at the merits phase, it has to re-consider its initial characterisation. The Hydrocarbon Concession and Contracts could indeed have been considered \"investment agreements\" if they had been signed between Argentina and a foreign investor, as results from the plain wording of Article VII(1) of the BIT which provides for the competence of arbitral tribunals over \"investment disputes.\" That term is defined in Article VII(1) as \"a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) *an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company \"115*\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n194.\n\nAs has been pointed out, CAPSA and CAPEX cannot be considered US companies. The inescapable conclusion is that the Hydrocarbon Concession and Contracts do not legally qualify as \"investment agreements\" under the relevant BIT. The disputes related to these agreements are therefore not, as such, investment disputes falling under the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.\n\n195.\n\nThis conclusion is corroborated *a contrario* by the decision in *Lanco International, Inc.* v. *Argentina)116* where the tribunal decided that the concessions were investment agreements, stating that \"insofar as Lanco is a party to [the concession agreement, the latter] can be characterised as an investment agreement.\"117 This conclusion was based on the fact that Lanco was not only a shareholder of the concession holder but also a party to the concession agreement, which is not the situation in the present case, where El Paso was not a party to the concession agreements, nor to any other contract with Argentina for that matter. It is also in line with the decision in *Occidental*\n\n*Exploration and Production Co. v. Ecuador,*118 where the tribunal, faced with the interpretation of an exclusion of tax matters similar to that found in Article XII of the BIT, had to determine whether or not an investment agreement was involved. As in *Lanco,* the tribunal found that there was indeed such an agreement, but that, as in *Lanco,* this was so because the contract was directly signed between the foreign investor and Petroecuador in the name of Ecuador:\n\n\"In 1999, OCCIDENTAL EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION COMPANY (\"OEPC\" or \"the Company\"), a company registered under the laws of California, *entered into a participation contract* (\"the Contract\" or \"Modified Participation Contract\") with Petroecuador, a State-owned corporation of Ecuador, to undertake exploration for and production of oil in Ecuador.\"119\n\n\"Investments were made by OEPC *under the Contract* in pursuance of its obligation and exclusive right to carry out the exploration and exploitation activities in the assigned area.\"120\n\n*Lanco International, Inc. v. The Argentine Republic* [hereinafter *Lanco],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6), Preliminary Decision on Jurisdiction of 8 December 1998.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 16.\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. The Republic of Ecuador* [hereinafter *Occidental* VAT], UNCITRAL Arbitration, Final Award of 1 July 2004, LCIA Case No. UN 3467.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 1. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 28. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n196.\n\nThis being the description of the contract, the tribunal in *Occidental Exploration and Production Company, v. Ecuador,* partly relying on *Lanco,* held that such a contract had to be considered an investment agreement:\n\n\"The Tribunal must note... that... the Modified Participation Contract qualifies as an \u2018investment agreement\u2019 under the Treaty. On this point the Tribunal believes that Ecuador\u2019s argument is consistent with the *Lanco* Preliminary Award in so far as this decision identified a concession contract, albeit structured in a more complex manner, with an investment agreement between the State and the foreign investor under the Argentine-United States bilateral investment treaty.\"121\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 44.\n\n197.\n\nThe present case has nothing to do with these two precedents as there never was a contract signed between El Paso and Argentina, nor was there a concession granted to El Paso by Argentina. The Tribunal considers that the concessions, having been granted to Argentinian companies and not to El Paso, do not qualify as investment agreements. It is only in partial agreement, therefore, with the Claimant, when the latter states in its Reply that \"[t]he equity interest in CAPSA/CAPEX and the Concessions are covered investments under the BIT. Thus, the definition of investment includes Claimant\u2019s interest in CAPSA/CAPEX and the concessions they hold.\"122 If indeed Claimant\u2019s shareholding in CAPSA/CAPEX is a protected investment, the contrary holds true for the concessions, which do not qualify as protected investments under the BIT entered into by Argentina and the United States.\n\nReply, \u00a7 504.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that no investment agreement protected by the BIT was concluded between Argentina and El Paso and that, as a consequence, the concession agreements entered into by the Argentinian companies cannot give rise to an ICSID claim as protected investments.\n\n*(ii) What Is El Paso\u2019s Investment?*\n------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Protection of the Shares under the ICSID Convention and under Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nIn the present case, El Paso\u2019s right to claim for interference with its shares under the ICSID Convention is not in dispute.\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Article I(1)(a)123 to address this issue in the context of the Argentina-United States BIT and the case at hand. The text of the provision is formulated in a somewhat circular way in that \"investments\" are defined as being \"investments.\" There are, however, further elements making that expression more precise.\n\n*See supra* \u00a7 143.\n\n201.\n\nFirst, as suggested by the Claimant, the expression \"investments\" is conceived broadly, witness the qualifier \"every kind of.\" Second, the investment made in one Contracting State must be \"owned or controlled directly or indirectly\" by nationals or companies of the other Contracting State. Hence, an investment is protected only if it is owned or controlled by such nationals or companies. The words \"owned or controlled,\" read in conjunction with the words \"directly or indirectly,\" suggest that the \"investment\" may be one made by a foreign national or a company incorporated under the laws of the host State but wholly or partly controlled by persons of the other Contracting State; in addition, such control may shift from persons of one foreign State to persons of another.124 Third, \"investments\" may, in particular, consist of \"equity, debt, and service and investment contracts,\" as well as \"tangible and intangible property\" and -this is crucial - companies \"or shares of stock or other interests in the assets thereof.\" Other categories of \"investments\" mentioned are claims to money or to performance having economic value and directly related to an investment, intellectual property, and - this is important equally in the present case - \"any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law.\"\n\n*Vivendi Annulment, supra* note 39, \u00a7 50.\n\n202.\n\nThe circular character of the initial definition of the term \"investments\" is amply made up for by the above elements. \"Investment\" covers almost any kind of economic input. It expressly includes \"shares of stock\" in companies, notably in entities which are incorporated under the laws of the receiving State. There is no limitation regarding the quantity of stock needed, nor are there restrictions regarding the situation of the company (in full operation, expropriated, in the process of liquidation, wound up) or the character of the claims (taking of the shares, right to a dividend, right to participate in stockholders\u2019 meetings, claims for losses in the value of shares). All this is clear evidence that the BIT, as asserted in its preamble, aims at facilitating private investment, promoting the flow of capital and creating conditions of fair and equitable treatment for investments.\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, according to the text of the BIT, the Parties intended to transfer to the BIT, lock, stock and barrel, the regime practised in the area of diplomatic protection and that the only change brought by the BITs was that the individual investors were now being given direct access to an international dispute settlement mechanism. This \"intention\" is not, however, attested to by anything and the respondent State has not even attempted to prove it.\n\n204.\n\nIt is of course true, as the Claimant observes, that the term \"investment\" used in Article I(1)(a)(v) includes, \"without limitation,\" \"any right conferred by law or contract, and any licences and permits pursuant to law.\" But, as shown above in paragraph 175, investors cannot have their cake and eat it too. The loss of value of El Paso\u2019s shares is due, to a large extent, to the measures taken against the legal and contractual rights of the Argentinian companies. To allow claims of El Paso on both counts, for the loss of value of its shares in the companies *and* for the prejudice suffered by the latter, would amount to compensating the Claimant twice.\n\n*(b) International Practice*\n----------------------------\n\n205.\n\nA spate of decisions of ICSID tribunals deals with the interpretation to be given to Article I(1)(a) of the Argentina-United States BIT or similar clauses of other BITs: *Lanco International, Ltd.* v. *Argentine Republic,125 Goetz* v. *Republic of Burundi,126 Maffezini* v. *Spain,127 Genin* v. *Estonia,128 CMS* v. *Argentina* (Decision on Jurisdiction and Decision of the Annulment Committee),129*Azurix* v. *Argentina)130 LG&E* v. *Argentina)131 Enron and Ponderosa Assets* v. *Argentina,132 Siemens* v. *Argentina.133* and *Pan American Energy* v. *Argentina.134*\n\n*Lanco, supra* note 116, \u00a7 10.\n\n*Antoine Goetz and others v.

The Argentine Republic* [hereinafter *Siemens],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Decision on Jurisdiction of 3 August 2004, \u00a7\u00a7 136-144.\n\n*Pan American v. The Argentine Republic,* and *BP America v. Argentine Republic* [hereinafter *Pan American],* Decision on Preliminary Objections of 27 July 2006, \u00a7\u00a7 209-221.\n\n206.\n\nWith the exception of *Goetz -* which only deals with the specific circumstances of that case, *i.e.* the presence of foreign majority shareholders - these precedents, taken collectively, yield the following conclusions:\n\n- the situation envisaged here is not one of diplomatic protection, as in *Barcelona Traction* and *ELSI,*135 and the practice reflected in those cases is not necessarily relevant here;\n\n- what is relevant is Article I(1)(a) of the Argentina-United States BIT as well as comparable provisions of other instruments, read according to their text and the preamble of the BIT;\n\n- these instruments protect the rights of foreign shareholders in domestic companies, more precisely their own rights as shareholders (right to the shares, right to a dividend, participation in stockholders\u2019 meetings, etc.), including the right to compensation for loss of value of stocks imputable to measures taken by the host State;\n\n- that protection is not limited to foreign majority shareholdings but encompasses minority holdings.\n\nThis last conclusion has been forcefully approved by the Annulment Committee in the case of *CMS:*\n\n\"The Committee observes that, as regards shareholder equity, the BIT contains nothing which indicates that the investor in capital stock has to have a majority of the stock or control over the administration of the company. Investments made by minority shareholders are covered by the actual language of the definition, as also recognized by ICSID arbitral tribunals in comparable cases.\"136\n\nTo this summary of the international practice, the Tribunal will now add further observations.\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (United States of America v. Italy)* [hereinafter *ELSI],* Judgement of 20 July 1989, ICJ Rep. 1989, p. 15.\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, Decision on Annulment, \u00a7 73.\n\n207.\n\nThe problem of the admissibility of claims by foreign shareholders has produced a steady trickle of international practice. According to that practice, the national States of foreign shareholders owning shares and the rights flowing therefrom - as defined in the preceding paragraph - are entitled to claim those rights regardless of the quantity or value of the shares held. It has generally been assumed that, as long as the company\u2019s home State was in a position to claim on the international level, by way of diplomatic protection, the shareholders\u2019 national States could not claim for any infringement of the rights of the company, or could do so only if the shareholders\u2019 rights had become immediate rights against the host State as a result of the disappearance of the company itself.\n\n208.\n\nInternational practice, however, shows a clear tendency also to protect the interests of foreign shareholders where the company itself belongs to the respondent State, especially where incorporation in that State is a condition for making investments. In such instances, it is thought desirable to protect such interests, for otherwise there would be no protection at all. The *ELSI* case decided by a Chamber of the International Court of Justice137 attests to that tendency.\n\n*ELSI, supra* note 135, p. 15.\n\n209.\n\nMoreover, the present instance must be viewed, not from the angle of general international law, as the International Court of Justice did in *Barcelona Traction,* but from that of treaty law, specifically Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article I(1)(a) of the BIT between Argentina and the United States. An examination of those provisions and of the relevant international practice show that they deviate from *Barcelona Traction* and that they were intended to do so. This has also been acknowledged by the *CMS* Annulment Committee when it stated that \"[s]uch treaties [BITs] and in particular the ICSID Convention must be applied as *lex specialist* (\u00a7 69).\n\n210.\n\nWhether it can be asserted that, today, the *lex specialis* thus developed is \"so prevalent that it can now be considered the general rule,\" as stated by the ICSID tribunal in CMS,138 is a difficult question which the present Tribunal will not have to go into, however, since the case before it is governed by the *lex specialis* anyway.\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00a7 48.\n\n211.\n\nAnother issue regarded as unsolved by some is whether the foreign shareholding, to be protected, must be of some importance. The ICSID case-law recited earlier139 shows that, regarding the rights of foreign shareholders, no majority is required; a minority will suffice. That raises the further question of whether that minority must be a substantial one or whether even a single share could give rise to a claim. Some concern has indeed been voiced by international tribunals that not any minor portion of indirectly owned shares should necessarily be considered an investment. In *Enron,* the Claimants had a 35,263% indirect ownership of the shares of an Argentinian company through a complex corporate structure. The tribunal considered this an investment, while adding a *caveat:*\n\n\"The Tribunal notes that while investors can claim in their own rights under the provisions of the treaty, there is indeed a need to establish a cut-off point beyond which claims would not be permissible as they would only have a remote connection to the affected company.\"140\n\n*See supra* \u00a7\u00a7 205-206.\n\n*Enron, supra* note 52, Decision on Jurisdiction of 14 January 2004, \u00a7 52.\n\n212.\n\nIn the present instance, El Paso\u2019s shareholding interest in the Argentinian companies is undoubtedly substantial in nature, which is why the question does not have to be answered.\n\n*(iii) Summary*\n---------------\n\n213.\n\nBITs do not concern situations such as that addressed in *Barcelona Traction'.* they do not pertain to diplomatic protection, nor do they reflect the rules of general international law in matters of investment protection. Interpreted in conformity with the canons of treaty law, they prescribe that rights and interests of foreign shareholders, *in casu* El Paso\u2019s shareholdings in the Argentinian companies, are protected regardless of whether they are majority or minority participations.\n\n214.\n\nThe Tribunal has come to the clear conclusion that the investment protected by the BIT was constituted by the shares in the Argentinian companies that belonged to El Paso. The Claimant in fact has itself admitted this conclusion of the Tribunal, if one looks at its Memorial, where it is stated that \"[i]n summary, El Paso owned certain investments in Argentina, which include indirect noncontrolling shareholdings in CAPSA, CAPEX and Costanera and an indirect controlling shareholding in SERVICIOS.\"141 The overall conclusion related to the definition of the protected investment could be: what is protected are \"the shares, all the shares, but only the shares.\"\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 48.\n\n**IV. THE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nAs stated by the Claimant in its Memorial,\n\n\"[t]his dispute arises out of a series of laws, decrees, orders and resolutions of the GOA, mostly enacted during and since 2002, through which it fundamentally breached the *explicit and implicit obligations* it had assumed towards investors by abrogating and repudiating legal and contractual rights and radically altering the very economic, regulatory and legal frameworks that had been specifically designed to induce investment, and upon which El Paso had relied in making its investments in Argentina.\"142\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 20. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondent has a totally different approach to the events and considers that what happened was a terrible economic crisis affecting all economic actors and that El Paso was necessarily caught in these economic disturbances:\n\n\"Isolating the foreign investor from the crisis through the ICSID is distorting the nature and purpose of the protection granted by treaties to investors only to turn them into privileged subjects that may appear before such World Bank agency seeking protection against structural crises as the one undergone by the Argentine economy. Bilateral treaties are not good business insurance or a protection against a crisis.\"143\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 316.\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal does not see exactly what the Claimant means by \"implicit\" obligations, unless this is a mere formula to extend State liability. It will therefore concentrate on the explicit obligations towards American investors undertaken by Argentina when ratifying the Argentina-US BIT, to establish whether any of these obligations have been violated. If the answer is positive, the Tribunal will still have to verify whether there are circumstances, according to the BIT or general international law, under which these acts cannot be qualified as BIT violations.\n\n218.\n\nBefore examining whether the violation of the Claimant\u2019s rights amounts to a breach of one or more BIT standards, it is necessary for the Tribunal to have a full picture of the rights alleged by the Claimant which the latter considers to have been violated. These rights were stated first in the Request for Arbitration, and no new right was asserted thereafter. A distinction has to be drawn between the Electricity Sector and the Hydrocarbon Sector.\n\n219.\n\nIn the **Electricity Sector,** the following rights are said to have been violated in the Request for Arbitration:144\n\n- Right to receive Capacity Payments in dollars.\n\n- Right to have Spot Market Prices set at a uniform rate based on the marginal production cost of the system.\n\n- Right to have Spot Prices calculated in dollars.\n\n- Right to collect payments for spot energy supplies in accordance with pre-established conditions.145\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic,* Request for Arbitration of 6 June 2003. [hereinafter Request for Arbitration], \u00a7\u00a7 55, 56, 58 and 60.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s Memorial, the power generation dispute is described as an alteration of the electricity market involving the following measures, all considered as a violation of the investor\u2019s rights:  \n 1. Alteration of Spot Price Setting Mechanisms;  \n 2. Pesification of VCPs at an Artificial Exchange Rate;  \n 3. Caps on Spot Prices;  \n4. Reduction in Value of Capacity Payments;  \n 5. Additional Alterations of the Electricity Regulatory Framework;  \n 6. Mandatory Currency Conversion of Power, LPG and Crude Oil Sale Contracts;  \n 7. GOA\u2019s Interference in Generators\u2019 Ability to Collect Bills.  \n The list seems longer but it is only more detailed and refers always to the same four rights invoked in the Request for Arbitration.\n\n220.\n\nIn the **Hydrocarbon Sector,** the following rights are alleged to have been breached in the Request for Arbitration:146\n\n- Right to have hydrocarbon exports exempted from export taxes and withholdings.\n\n- Right to export freely.\n\n- Right to dollar-denominated sale and purchase agreements.147\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00a7\u00a7 68-70.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s Memorial, the oil and gas dispute is described as a violation of the Hydrocarbon Regulatory Framework, implying a violation of the three same rights as listed in the Request for Arbitration:  \n 1. Violation of the Right to Export Hydrocarbons Free of Export Withholdings;  \n 2. Imposition of Restrictions on Exports;  \n 3. The Right to Dollar-denominated Purchase and Sale Agreements Violated by Pesification.\n\n221.\n\nIt is worth underscoring that El Paso does not claim that the devaluation *per se* constitutes a violation of the BIT. In fact, El Paso\u2019s core claim, really consists in claiming the violation of its right to earn a reasonable return on its investments, as appears, for example, from its own conclusion of the analysis of the measures adopted in the Electricity Sector which is found in its Memorial and where it is stated that:\n\n\"El Paso\u2019s most fundamental right with respect to CAPEX and Costanera was the right to operate within an Electricity Regulatory Framework that would permit them to receive capacity payments sufficient to cover their investment costs, and energy prices sufficient to recover their costs of production, while also earning a reasonable return on the investment.\"148\n\nIn the same submission, it is also claimed, more generally, that \"El Paso was deprived of the reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of its investment in the Argentine Companies.\"149\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 324.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 450.\n\n222.\n\nEl Paso recognises that the BIT does not protect foreign investors and their investments against devaluation. The Tribunal takes note of this position and takes this opportunity to point out that devaluation pertains to the monetary and fiscal sovereignty of the State and to indicate its agreement with the *dictum* of the tribunal in *Continental v. Argentina* relating to the question of devaluation:\n\n\"The fixing of an exchange rate and deciding the mechanism by which the national currency may be exchanged for foreign currency and its conditions, including the possibility of maintaining accounts and deposits denominated in a foreign currency within the country, pertain to the monetary sovereignty of each State. These policies... do not render the State liable for the burden or losses that may be suffered by those affected, provided there is no discrimination or unfairness in their application.\"150\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic* [hereinafter *Continental],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9), Award of 5 September 2008, \u00a7 278. This case arose after the Parties had made their submissions, and for this reason, the Tribunal does not rely on it for its decision, but it considers it interesting to point to some convergences of the reasoning in that case with the one adopted by this Tribunal.\n\n223.\n\nIt should also be mentioned here that throughout its submissions, El Paso has complained about measures adopted after the sale of its investments.151 The Tribunal must however note that these measures cannot - from a logical point of view alone - be taken into account to evaluate whether the sale of El Paso\u2019s shares was or was not entirely forced by Argentina\u2019s measures, or whether these measures played, among other factors, a significant role in the sale.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 327: \"Furthermore, the situation in the electricity market, particularly for power generators, has deteriorated progressively and significantly since El Paso sold its investments in CAPSA/CAPEX in June 2003 and in COSTANERA in October 2003.\"\n\n224.\n\nBefore it begins to evaluate the facts and contentions of the Parties in this case, in order to ascertain whether or not they show violations of the international standards of protection of foreign investments, the Tribunal wishes to insist on the specificity of the facts of each case and considers it appropriate to identify the legal framework within which the factual aspects can and must be examined. As stated in *Continental,*\n\n\"each case addressing Argentina\u2019s crisis, with its different parties, claims and legal texts, raises its own special issues and particular considerations. Guided by the issues in the present case, the Tribunal has made its own analysis and has arrived at its own conclusions based upon the materials presented by the Parties in these proceedings.\"152\n\nOnce ascertained, the facts as they result from the record have to be analysed taking due account of the applicable rules. It is therefore of utmost importance to try to identify the content and scope of the different standards of protection benefiting foreign investors under the BIT.\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 103.\n\nA. General Observations on the Different Standards of Protection\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nThe standards of protection applicable to foreign investments, in addition to the protection against expropriation provided for in Article IV (1), are stated in Article Il(2)(a) and (b).\n\nArticle IV (1) of the BIT prescribes:\n\n\"Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (\"expropriation\") except for a public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II(2).\"\n\nArticle Il(2)(a) and (b) provides that:\n\n\"(a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\n\n(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, or disposal of investments. For the purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VII and VIII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory, notwithstanding the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.\"\n\n226.\n\nICSID case-law has developed in a way that generates some confusion and overlap between these different standards of protection found in most BITs. In view of this situation, which is not conducive to security of the legal framework and predictability of its application to foreign investments, the Tribunal will endeavour to clarify as much as possible the scope of the different standards of protection, for it is convinced that they should not be used indifferently one for the other. Before doing so, it thinks it appropriate to give a few examples of the prevailing confusion which, in its view, justifies its approach.\n\n227.\n\nThere is not always a clear distinction between *indirect expropriation* and *violation of legitimate expectations,* as can be seen from an excerpt of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial stating that \"measures that are inconsistent with an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations constitute an expropriation\"153 or of the Claimant\u2019s Reply, where it is asserted that\n\n\"[s]everal other ICSID cases have held that an indirect expropriation occurs when the State repudiates fundamental commitments in frustration of an investor\u2019s legitimate expectations deriving from the rights granted in contracts, law or decrees (which, under the BIT, clearly are \"investments\" protected against any form of expropriation).\"154\n\nAccording to this Tribunal, the violation of a legitimate expectation should rather be protected by the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 432.\n\nReply, \u00a7451.\n\n228.\n\nSometimes, there is also *no distinction between the fair and equitable treatment (FET) and the full protection and security (FPS)* standards. This has been the position adopted by the tribunal in *Azurix:*\n\n\"The Tribunal is persuaded of the interrelationship of fair and equitable treatment and the obligation to afford the investor full protection and security... when the terms \u2018protection and security\u2019 are qualified by \u2018full\u2019 and no other adjective or explanation, they extend, in their ordinary meaning, the content of this standard beyond physical security. To conclude, the Tribunal, having held that the Respondent failed to provide fair and equitable treatment to the investment, finds that the Respondent also breached the standard of full protection and security under the BIT.\"155\n\nAnother example of this confusion can be found in the so-called VAT arbitration, *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador,* where the tribunal declared that \"treatment that is not fair and equitable automatically entails an absence of full protection and security of the investment.\"156 The Claimant in our case takes the same position and assimilates FET and FPS, alleging that the FPS has been breached because Argentina has adopted laws interfering with the Claimant\u2019s investment:\n\n\"The GOA not only failed to protect the investment of El Paso, but affirmatively disregarded the terms of the Electricity Regulatory Framework, the Hydrocarbons Regulatory Framework and the Concessions, and destroyed the very protections and security provided by law. In Law N\u00b0 25,561 and its progeny, the GOA nullified essential vested rights it offered and promoted to investors. Thus, the GOA failed to provide full security and protection to El Paso\u2019s investments.\"157\n\n*Azurix, supra* note 50, \u00a7 408.\n\n*Occidental VAT, supra* note 118, \u00a7 187.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 562.\n\n229.\n\nSometimes there is *no distinction between several standards of treatment,* which are all amalgamated, as was done by the tribunal in *Noble Ventures,* stating that:\n\n\"Considering the place of the fair and equitable treatment standard at the very beginning of Art.II(2), one can consider this to be a more general standard which finds its specific application in *inter alia* the duty to provide full protection and security, the prohibition of arbitrary and discriminatory measures and the obligation to observe contractual obligations towards the investor.\"158\n\n*Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania* [hereinafter *Noble Ventures],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11), Award of 12 October 2005, \u00a7 182.\n\n230.\n\nThe distinction seems also often difficult *between arbitrary or discriminatory treatment* and *violation of the FET.* It must of course be emphasised that it is quite non-controversial that an arbitrary or discriminatory treatment is necessarily a violation of the FET as well, as mentioned for example in *CMS:*\n\n\"The standard of protection against arbitrariness and discrimination is related to that of fair and equitable treatment. Any measure that might involve arbitrariness or discrimination is in itself contrary to fair and equitable treatment.\"159\n\nThis is of course true, but the reverse might not necessarily be, as violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard could result from types of situations other than arbitrariness or discrimination. The difference should be sufficient to prevent an assimilation of the two categories of violations. It is, in fact, the Tribunal\u2019s view that FET is designed to guarantee that, in situations where the other more precise standards are not violated, but where there is an unreasonable interference bringing about an unjust result regarding an investor\u2019s expectations, that investor can claim a violation of the FET and obtain reparation therefore.\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 290.\n\n231.\n\nIn conclusion, it seems to the Tribunal that, in order not to engage in redundant analyses, interferences with a foreign investment should be analysed successively with reference to the different standards of protection in a sequential order, proceeding from expropriation to violation of the FPS. In other words, the Tribunal will examine first whether there is an indirect expropriation, second whether there is arbitrary or discriminatory treatment, third whether there is a violation of the FET, and fourth whether there is a breach of the FPS.\n\nB. Article IV: Indirect Expropriation\n-------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the complaints of El Paso concerning acts of the GOA, other than tax measures, which the Claimant considers as expropriatory. It will then deal with the tax measures complained of, which only enter into the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction if they amount to expropriation. Before scrutinising the facts, the Tribunal will set the applicable analytical framework.\n\n***1. Indirect Expropriation in General***\n------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Tribunal\u2019s Legal Analysis of the Applicable Principles*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nMuch has been said about the concept of indirect expropriation in the written and oral submissions of the Parties in this case, as well as in contemporary legal writings. The Tribunal will endeavour to clarify that concept and present first its analysis in a nutshell, before developing it in more detail. In summary, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that:\n\n1. Some general regulations can amount to indirect expropriation\n\na. As a matter of principle, general regulations do not amount to indirect expropriation.\n\nb. By exception, unreasonable general regulations can amount to indirect expropriation.\n\n2. A necessary condition for expropriation is the neutralisation of the use of the investment\n\na. This means that at least one of the essential components of the property rights must have disappeared.\n\nb. This means also, *a contrario,* that a mere loss in value of the investment, even an important one, is not an indirect expropriation.160\n\nCharles Leben summarised the practice of ICSID tribunals in relation to indirect expropriation in the following manner: \"1. *Les \u00e9l\u00e9ments essentiels du droit de propri\u00e9t\u00e9 doivent avoir disparu. 2. Une simple perte de valeur de l\u2019investissement ne peut \u00eatre assimil\u00e9e \u00e0 une expropriation.\"* See \"La libert\u00e9 normative de l\u2019Etat et la question de l\u2019expropriation indirecte,\" in Ch. Leben (ed.), *Le contentieux arbitral international relatif \u00e0 l\u2019investissement,* Louvain4a-Neuve, Arthemis, 2006, 163, at 173-174.\n\n*(a) Some General Regulations Can Amount to Indirect Expropriation*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n234.\n\nNo absolute position can be taken in such delicate matters, where contradictory interests have to be reconciled. In this sense, the Tribunal subscribes to the decisions which have refused to hold that a general regulation issued by a State and interfering with the rights of foreign investors can *never* be considered expropriatory because it should be analysed as an exercise of the State\u2019s sovereign power or of its police powers. This Tribunal is, for example, in agreement with the following statement made in *Tecmed.*\n\n\"... we find no principle stating that regulatory administrative actions are *per se* excluded from the scope of the Agreement, even if they are beneficial to society as a whole - such as environmental protection -particularly if the negative economic impact of such actions on the financial position of the investor is sufficient to neutralize in full the value, or economic or commercial use of its investment without receiving any compensation whatsoever.\"161\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, SA. v. The United Mexican States* [hereinafter *Tecmed],* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award of 29 May 2003, \u00a7 121.\n\n235.\n\nBy the same token, the Tribunal shares the view expressed by the tribunal in *Pope & Talbot,* when it declares that \"... a blanket exception for regulatory measures would create a gaping loophole in international protections against expropriation.\"162 The same idea was expressed in *Saluka v. The Czech Republic,* where the tribunal listed the exceptions to the principle that general regulations do not as a rule amount to expropriation:\n\n\"These exceptions do not, in any way, weaken the principle that certain takings or deprivations are non-compensable. They merely remind the legislator, or, indeed, the adjudicator, that the so-called \u2018police power exception\u2019 is not absolute.\"163\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada* [hereinafter *Pope & Talbot],* UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Interim Award of 26 June 2000, \u00a7 99.\n\n*Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic* [hereinafter *Saluka],* UNCITRAL, Partial Award of 17 March 2006, \u00a7 258.\n\n236.\n\nTherefore, in order to differentiate between situations where a general regulation can be considered tantamount to expropriation and situations where it cannot, the Tribunal has to start from the principle and then look at the exceptions. It considers that the most appropriate approach is to admit that, as a matter of principle, a general regulation - whose object is not the taking of property as in the case of direct expropriation - does not amount to an indirect expropriation (a). This evident proposition finds support in State practice, doctrine and arbitral case-law. Of course, the general principle suffers exceptions and has to be set aside in some circumstances on account of the content of the regulations (b).\n\n*1. As a Matter of Principle, General Regulations Do Not Amount to Indirect Expropriation*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n237.\n\nThe above principle is accepted both by writers and arbitral case-law.\n\n238.\n\nThus, Professor Ian Brownlie has stated that:\n\n\"State measures, prima facie a lawful exercise of powers of government, may affect foreign interests considerably without amounting to expropriation. Thus foreign assets and their use may be subjected to taxation, trade restrictions involving licenses and quotas, or measures of devaluation. While special facts may alter cases, in principle such measures are not unlawful and do not constitute expropriation.\"164\n\nThe same principle is clearly stated in the *Third Restatement of the Foreign Relations Law of United States* 1987,165 which is often quoted as a formula of reference and which many consider as reflecting customary international law on this point:166\n\n\"A state is not responsible for loss of property or for other economic disadvantage resulting from bona fide general taxation, regulation, forfeiture for crime, or other action of the kind that is commonly accepted as within the police power of states, if it is not discriminatory.\"\n\nIan Brownlie, *Principles of Public International Law,* supra note 293, p. 532. This principle has not been only considered in international legal scholars\u2019 opinions but it has also been included in several international instruments. See, for example, Additional Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 4 November 1950, 213 U.N.T.S. 262, section 1; Harvard Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens, in L.B. Sohn / R. R. Baxter, \"Responsibility of States for Injuries to the Economic Interests of Aliens\", *55 Am. J. Int\u2019l L.* 545 (1961), at 554.\n\n*Restatement of the Law Third,* American Law Institute (1987), Vol. 2, Section 712, commentary g.\n\nSee in this sense, *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States* [hereinafter *Feldman],* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1), Award of 16 December 2002, \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 105.\n\n239.\n\nSeveral arbitral tribunals have also restated this fundamental principle. In *Feldman v. Mexico,* the ICSID arbitral tribunal said that:\n\n\"Governments must be free to act in the broader public interest through protection of the environment, new or modified tax regimes, the granting or withdrawal of government subsidies, reductions or increases in tariff levels, imposition of zoning restrictions and the like. Reasonable governmental regulation of this type cannot be achieved if any business that is adversely affected may seek compensation, and it is safe to say that customary international law recognizes this.\"\n\n\u2026\n\n\"... not all government regulatory activity that makes it difficult or impossible for an investor to carry out a particular business, change in the law or change in the application of existing laws that makes it uneconomical to continue a particular business, is an expropriation... Governments, in their exercise of regulatory power, frequently change their laws and regulations in response to changing economic circumstances or changing political, economic or social considerations... those changes may well make their activities less profitable or even uneconomic to continue.\"167\n\nA similar general statement is found in *Tecmed.*\n\n\"The principle that the State\u2019s exercise of its sovereign powers within the framework of its police power may cause economic damage to those subject to its powers as administrator without entitling them to any compensation whatsoever is indisputable.\"168\n\nBut the clearest and strongest assertion of the principle can be found in the *Saluka* award, an UNCITRAL investment arbitration under a BIT :\n\n\"It is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona fide regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.\"169\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 112. *See* also *Ronald S. Lauder v. The Czech Republic* [hereinafter *Lauder],* UNCITRAL,, Award (Final) of 3 September 2001 \u00a7\u00a7 200-201; *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. SA. v. Arab Republic of Egypt* [hereinafter *Middle East Cement],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6), Award of 12 April 2002, \u00a7 153.\n\n*Tecmed, supra* note 161, \u00a7 119.\n\n*Saluka, supra* note 163, \u00a7 255.\n\n240.\n\nIn sum, a general regulation is a lawful act rather than an expropriation if it is non-discriminatory, made for a public purpose and taken in conformity with due process. In other words, *in principle, general non-discriminatory regulatory measures, adopted in accordance with the rules of good faith and due process, do not entail a duty of compensation.*\n\n*2. By Exception, Unreasonable General Regulations Can Amount to Indirect Expropriation*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nIf general regulations are unreasonable, *i.e.* arbitrary, discriminatory, disproportionate or otherwise unfair, they can, however, be considered as amounting to indirect expropriation if they result in a neutralisation of the foreign investor\u2019s property rights. The need for reasonableness and proportionality of State measures interfering with private property has been stressed by the tribunal in *LG&E:*\n\n\"With respect to the power of the State to adopt its policies, it can generally be said that the State has the right to adopt measures having a social or general welfare purpose. In such a case, the measure must be accepted without any imposition of liability, except in cases where the State\u2019s action is obviously disproportionate to the need being addressed.\"170\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, Decision on Liability, \u00a7 195.\n\n242.\n\nThe Claimant itself cites the Harvard Draft Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens171 which provides that a taking of property may include any\n\n\"*unreasonable interference* with the use, enjoyment or disposal of property as to justify an inference that the owner thereof will not be able to *use, enjoy, or dispose of the property* within a reasonable period of time after the inception of such interference.\"172\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s Memorial, indirect expropriation is precisely said to result from \"unreasonable interference that significantly deprives an owner of the control, use, or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefits of property, rights or interests.\"173\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 422.\n\nDraft Convention on the International Responsibility of States for Injuries to Aliens, Article lO(3)(a), in L.B. Sohn /R. R. Baxter, \"Responsibility of States for Injuries to the Economic Interests of Aliens\", 55 *Am. J. Int \u2019I L.* 545, at 553 (1961). Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 430.\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal will now review some examples where such general regulations have been considered as possible expropriations. A first example is that of an *intentionally discriminatory regulation* or *an objectively discriminatory regulation.* Although it did not find that in the case under review there had been an indirect expropriation, the tribunal in the *Methanex* case clearly distinguished discriminatory regulations from non-discriminatory ones:\n\n\"In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Methanex is correct that an intentionally discriminatory regulation against a foreign investor fulfils a key requirement for establishing expropriation. But as a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which affects, *inter alias,* a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.\"174\n\nAnother example would be a *disproportionate regulation,* meaning a regulation in which the interference with the private rights of the investors is disproportionate to the public interest. In other words, proportionality has to exist between the public purpose fostered by the regulation and the interference with the investors\u2019 property rights, as recognised in *Tecmed.*\n\n\"After establishing that regulatory actions and measures will not be initially excluded from the definition of expropriatory acts, in addition to the negative financial impact of such actions or measures, the Arbitral Tribunal will consider, in order to determine if they are to be characterized as expropriatory, whether such actions or measures are proportional to the public interest presumably protected thereby and to the protection legally granted to investments, taking into account that the significance of such impact has a key role upon deciding the proportionality... There must be a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the charge or weight imposed to the foreign investor and the aim sought to be realized by any expropriatory measure.\"175\n\nIn other words, discriminatory or disproportionate general regulations have the potential to be considered as expropriatory if there is a sufficient interference with the investor\u2019s rights, as will be explained now.\n\n*Methanex v. United States* [hereinafter Methzanex], UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Final Award of 3 August 2005, \u00a7 7 of Part IV - Chapter D.\n\n*Tecmed, supra* note 161, \u00a7 122.\n\n***2. A Necessary Condition for Expropriation: The Neutralisation of the use of the Investment***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nEtymologically, \"ex-propriation\" refers to the taking of property or property rights. In *S.D. Myers v. Canada,* a clear distinction was drawn between deprivation amounting to expropriation and interference with property by regulations not amounting to expropriation:\n\n\"Expropriations tend to involve the deprivation of ownership rights; regulations a lesser interference. The distinction between expropriation and regulation screens out most potential cases of complaints concerning economic intervention by a state and reduces the risk that governments will be subject to claims as they go about their business of managing public affairs.\"176\n\n*S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada* [hereinafter *S.D. Myers],* UNCITRAL (NAFTA), First Partial Award of 13 November 2000, \u00a7 282.\n\n*(i) At Least One of the Essential Components of the Property Rights Must Have Disappeared*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that at least one of the essential components of the property rights must have disappeared for an expropriation to have occurred. It emphasises that the overwhelming majority of investment arbitration cases stand for the proposition that an expropriation usually implies a \"removal of the ability of an owner to make use of its economic rights.\"177 It is generally accepted that the decisive element in an indirect expropriation is the *'loss of control\u2019* of a foreign investment, in the absence of any physical taking.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 283.\n\n246.\n\nIn the case of *Pope & Talbot,* Canada stated that \"mere interference is not expropriatory; rather, a significant degree of deprivation of fundamental rights of ownership is required\",178 and the tribunal accepted this approach when it said that \"the test is whether that interference is sufficiently restrictive to support a conclusion that the property has been \u2018taken\u2019 from the owner.\"179 In the case of *Tecmed,* the same approach was adopted, the tribunal holding that there is an indirect expropriation when \"the economic value of the use, enjoyment or disposition of the assets or rights affected by the administrative action or decision have been neutralized or destroyed.\"180\n\n*Pope & Talbot, supra* note 162, \u00a7 99.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 102.\n\n*Tecmed, supra* note 161, \u00a7 116.\n\n247.\n\nThis approach has also been adopted in several of the Argentinian cases resulting from the crisis which brought about the present litigation. In *CMS,* the tribunal first mentioned the general criterion to be applied in order to ascertain whether there has been an expropriation:\n\n\"The essential question is therefore to establish whether the enjoyment of the property has been effectively neutralized. The standard that a number of tribunals have applied in recent cases where indirect expropriation has been contended is that of substantial deprivation.\"181\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 262.\n\n248.\n\nThen, applying this test to the case at hand, the tribunal considered that the measures adopted by the State did not deprive the investor of control over its investment and therefore concluded that there was no expropriation. In *Enron182* as well as in *Sempra,183* the tribunals held that for expropriation to exist there must be a substantial deprivation and that such a deprivation occurs when the investor is forced to lose control over the investment. If the measures do not interfere with the control of the property, there can be no expropriation. This has been confirmed more recently by the award in another Argentinian case, *Continental,* where an indirect expropriation was defined as amounting to\n\n\"... limitations and hampering with property, short of outright suppression or deprivation, interfering with one or more key features, such as management, enjoyment, transferability, which are considered as tantamount to expropriation, because of their substantial impact on the effective right of property.\"184\n\n*Enron, supra* note 52, \u00a7 245.\n\n*Sempra, supra* note 53, \u00a7 285.\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 276.\n\n*(ii) A Mere Loss in Value of the Investment, even though Important, Is Not an Indirect Expropriation*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, a mere loss in value of the investment, even if important, is not an indirect expropriation. This was also stated, for example, in the *Waste Management* case where the tribunal explicitly pointed out that \"the loss of benefits or expectations is not a sufficient criterion for an expropriation, even if it is a necessary one.\"185 The Tribunal is, of course, aware of some cases or general *dicta* that might seem to support the idea that a substantial deprivation of the value of an investment can also be viewed as an expropriation. But a careful scrutiny of those cases, some of which were cited by the Claimant, does not support such a conclusion, as will be shown now.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. The United Mexican States* [hereinafter *Waste Management II\\,* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3), Award of 30 April 2004, \u00a7 159.\n\n250.\n\nIn *Middle East Cement v. Egypt,* relied on by the Claimant,186 an ICSID tribunal found that Egypt had violated the provision on expropriation of the Egypt-Greece BIT. In that case, the Egyptian General Authority for Investment and Free Zones had granted a 10-year license to a Greek bulk cement importer for the importation and storage of cement. Some years later, Egypt issued a decree prohibiting the importation of certain types of cement. This decree, which on its face did not purport to take the investor\u2019s property or affect the investor\u2019s import license, nevertheless paralysed the investor\u2019s operations. In the ensuing arbitration proceedings, the foreign investor argued that, although the license technically remained in effect after the decree, the latter destroyed the economic benefit of the investment. The tribunal concluded that there was an expropriation, although the decree remained in force for only four months, with the following explanation:\n\n\"As also Respondent concedes that, at least for a period of 4 months, Claimant was deprived, by the Decree, of rights it had been granted under the License, there is no dispute between the Parties, that in principle, a taking did take place. When measures are taken by a State the effect of which is to deprive the investor of the use and benefit of its investment even though it may retain nominal ownership of the respective rights being the investment, the measures are often referred to as \u2018creeping\u2019 or as \u2018indirect\u2019 expropriation, or, as in the BIT, as measures the effect of which is tantamount to expropriation. As a matter of fact, the investor is deprived by such measures of parts of the value of its investment.\"187\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to point to the fact that, if indeed a reference is made to the deprivation of the benefit of the investment, the formula used by the tribunal in *Middle East Cement* refers more precisely to the deprivation of \"the use and benefit.\" The loss of benefit is a result of the impossibility to use the investment - equivalent to a loss of control over the investment - and not an expropriation *per se.*\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 434; Reply, \u00a7 451. See also *Middle East Cement, supra* note 167.\n\n*Middle East Cement, ibid.,* \u00a7 107.\n\n251.\n\nIn *Goetz and Others v. Republic of Burundi,* another case invoked by the Claimant,188 the tribunal held:\n\n\"Since... the revocation of the Minister for Industry and Commerce of the free zone certificate forced them to halt all activities..., which deprived their investments of all utility and deprived the claimant investors of the benefit which they could have expected from their investments, the disputed decision can be regarded as a \u2018measure having similar effect\u2019 to a measure depriving of or restricting property within the meaning of Article 4 of the Investment Treaty.\"189\n\nIn this case also, there is a reference to the deprivation of the expected benefit, but this was a result of the cancellation by the State of a free-zone certificate which prevented the investor from continuing any economic activity, which is indeed a situation where it can be said that the investor was expropriated as it completely lost the use of its property.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 435; Reply, \u00a7 463, citing *Goetz, supra* note 126.\n\n*Goetz, supra* note 126, \u00a7 124 (translation by the Tribunal).\n\n252.\n\n*Metalclad* is often mentioned, and was cited by the Claimant,190 in support of the proposition that a mere loss in value of an investment is an expropriation. It is true that the tribunal in this case used a very general formulation, which could be misconstrued if it were truncated:\n\n\"Thus, expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\"191\n\nTwo remarks are worth making here. First, as in the former examples, *the loss of benefits is a result of a deprivation of the use* of the investment. Second, considering the facts and not the mere broad language, it is evident that the tribunal in *Metalclad* did not hold that there was an expropriation because the benefits of the investor were not as expected, but decided that there was an expropriation of the investment because, after the investor was granted the federal permit to exploit the landfill, and given assurances that it would receive the municipal permit to the same effect, the latter was not granted, rendering the whole project impossible to pursue: it was because there was a complete neutralisation of the investment project that an expropriation was found.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 436; Reply, \u00a7 448 and \u00a7 455, citing *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States* [hereinafter *Metalclad],* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Award of 30 August 2000.\n\n*Metalclad, ibid.,* \u00a7 103.\n\n253.\n\nNor does another case cited by the Claimant, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, support the idea that a loss in value is an expropriation. In *Tecmed,192* the claims were related to an investment in land, buildings and other assets relating to a controlled landfill operation with hazardous industrial waste. A resolution cancelling the authorisation to run the waste landfill operation was adopted, among other reasons, because of the strong opposition of the local population. The tribunal had to study the resolution cancelling the permit. In order to decide on the existence of an indirect expropriation, the tribunal made the following analysis:\n\n\"To establish whether the Resolution is a measure equivalent to an expropriation under the terms of section 5(1) of the Agreement, it must be first determined if the Claimant, due to the Resolution, was radically deprived of the economical use and enjoyment of its investments, as if the rights related thereto - such as the income or benefits related to the Landfill or to its exploitation - had ceased to exist. In other words, if due to the actions of the Respondent, the assets involved have lost their value or economic use for their holder and the extent of the loss. This determination is important because it is one of the main elements to distinguish, from the point of view of an international tribunal, between a regulatory measure, which is an ordinary expression of the exercise of the state\u2019s police power that entails a decrease in assets or rights, and a *de facto* expropriation that deprives those assets and rights of any real substance.\"193\n\nHere again, it was not just a loss of benefits that was considered to be expropriatory; it was the cancellation of the permit which neutralised the whole investment, as no other activity could be performed on the landfill. This was underscored by the tribunal, according to which there is an indirect expropriation when \"the economic value of the use, enjoyment or disposition of the assets or rights affected by the administrative action or decision have been neutralized or destroyed.\"194\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 437; Reply, \u00a7 454, citing *Tecmed, supra* note 161.\n\n*Tecmed, ibid,* \u00a7 115.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 116.\n\n254.\n\nEven in *Consortium R.F.C.C. v. Morocco,* also cited sometimes to support the idea that loss of value is sufficient to find an indirect expropriation, careful reading shows that in fact the tribunal based its reasoning on the necessity of a neutralisation of property rights. The tribunal started by referring to the fact that for an expropriation to exist, the measures taken by the State must have\n\n\"... [s]ubstantial effects of a definite intensity that decrease and/or make disappear the benefits that can be legitimately expected from the exploitation of the rights that were the object of the measure to such an extent that they render the possession of those rights useless.\"195\n\nIn the preceding paragraph, the tribunal had been quite clear that this disappearance of benefits had to be the result of a loss of control or access to the property rather than of a change in the assets\u2019 value:\n\n\"The expropriation of an asset or a right is characterised by the disappearance, for the expropriated person, if not of the title to property at least of the enjoyment of the said property or of the access to it.\"196\n\n*Consortium R.F.C.C. v. Kingdom of Morocco* [hereinafter *Consortium v. Morocco],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/6), Award of 22 December 2003, \u00a7 69. Translation by the Tribunal.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 68. Translation by the Tribunal.\n\n255.\n\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that in all the Argentinian cases decided so far, the loss in value of the investment was not considered a sufficient basis for a finding of expropriation, even where the loss was quite significant and comparable to the losses claimed in the present case by El Paso. In *LG&E,* for example, although according to the claimant the value of LG&E\u2019s holdings in the licenses had been reduced by more than 90% as a result of Respondent\u2019s abrogation of the principal guarantees of the tariff system, the tribunal did not find an expropriation, as the measures themselves did not interfere \"with the investment\u2019s ability to carry on its business,\"197 even though the profits were drastically diminished. Regulations that reduce the profitability of an investment but do not shut it down completely and leave the investor in control will generally not qualify as indirect expropriations even though they might give rise to liability for violation of other standards of treatment, such as national treatment or fair and equitable treatment.\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7 191.\n\n256.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal, consistently with mainstream case-law, finds that for an expropriation to exist, the investor should be substantially deprived not only of the benefits, but also of the use of his investment. A mere loss of value, which is not the result of an interference with the control or use of the investment, is not an indirect expropriation.\n\n*(iii) The Parties\u2019 Positions on the Existence of an Expropriation*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[t]he Argentine Republic expropriated Claimant\u2019s investments directly, indirectly or by measures tantamount to expropriation.\"198 The list of the expropriatory acts presented by the Claimant is the following: abrogation and repudiation of contractual rights of the Argentinian companies; violation of the right to collect payments as promised, which constitutes a taking of CAPEX\u2019s and Costanera\u2019s rights, legitimate expectations and revenues without compensation; pesification of capacity payments at an artificial exchange rate, which amounts to an expropriation of legal rights, legal expectations and significant revenues from CAPEX and Costanera; fundamental alteration of the price-setting mechanism for electrical generators, which resulted in the expropriation of the legal rights, legitimate expectations and specific revenues of CAPEX and Costanera; pesification of VCPs at an artificial exchange rate which constitutes a taking of El Paso\u2019s rights, legitimate expectations and revenues; violation of the right to freely dispose of production, which interfered in the business decisions and management of CAPSA and CAPEX; and violation of the right freely to dispose of production, which constituted a direct taking of CAPSA\u2019s and CAPEX\u2019s revenues.199\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 468.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 470-497.\n\n258.\n\nMore generally, it is the Claimant\u2019s contention that it was expropriated because, due to all the adverse measures taken against the Argentinian companies in which it had invested, it was \"forced\" to sell its shares in those companies at a considerable loss. In its Reply, the Claimant states that expropriation results from measures\n\n\"... destroying 100% of the equity value of SERVICIOS, 83% of the equity value of CAPSA/CAPEX, and 91% of the equity value of COSTANERA and compelling El Paso to sell its interests in the Argentine Companies for less than 15% of what would have been their value in the absence of the measures.\"200\n\nReply, \u00a7 422.\n\n259.\n\nAccording to Argentina, none of the rights invoked by El Paso are rights protected under the BIT. The measures adopted in the context of the crisis did not amount to expropriation. Argentina argues that: the pesification of the whole economy was not an expropriation and benefited the Argentinian companies; the restrictions on oil and gas exports were not expropriations; nor were the measures adopted to make electric power generation consistent with the new context. Neither on account of their effect nor in view of their nature can these measures be considered expropriatory.\n\n260.\n\nFirst, it is Argentina\u2019s position that these measures did not interfere substantially with rights possessed by the Claimant. According to the Respondent:\n\n\"In effect, the *pesification* of the whole economy and the measures adopted in connection with the oil and electric power generation industries did not substantially deprive the Claimant from the use and profits of its investment [paraphrasing the tribunal in the *Otis Elevator* case]. On the contrary, the Argentine Companies continued and continue operating and obtaining profits despite the crisis.\"201\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 582. Emphasis by the Respondent.\n\n261.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that the measures challenged by El Paso were non-discriminatory regulatory decisions taken in good faith and included in the police power of the State. Therefore, no compensation would be due.\n\n262.\n\nThird, Argentina affirms that, contrary to what the Claimant pretends, the sale of El Paso was not forced by Argentina but provoked by the Claimant\u2019s own problems. These problems are addressed both in the Counter-Memorial202 and the Rejoinder,203 and are summarised in the former in the following way:\n\n\"Unlike El Paso\u2019s allegation, the Argentine crisis was not the cause why it decided to sell its assets in Argentina but this was the global situation of the company itself.\n\nThe energy crisis in California, the link with Enron\u2019s policies, the accusations of questionable accounting and business practices, an unfavourable court decision related to illegal practices, the strong fall in the value of its shares, the accumulation of a major debt, liquidity issues, the lack of market confidence, the resignation (and even suicide) of top executives, among others, were the events that led to the serious crisis in El Paso.\"204\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 61-89.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 1-59. It is to be noted that this was the very first argument developed by the Respondent in its Rejoinder.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 100-101.\n\n263.\n\nThe analysis of all these elements brings the Respondent to the conclusion that there is no causal link between the measures adopted by Argentina to face the crisis and the sale of El Paso\u2019s shares in the Argentinian companies:\n\n\"The only cause of the damages, the compensation for which is claimed in this arbitration, is El Paso\u2019s global situation that forced it to sell its interests around the world, including those located in Argentina. The fact that Argentina was in the midst of a crisis had a negative impact on the price collected by El Paso on account of the sale of its assets in Argentina, but it was not what determined that the transaction had to be carried out.\"205\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 105.\n\n264.\n\nIn other words, the sale was not due to Argentina\u2019s measures but to a reasoned decision taken by El Paso, in light of its financial difficulties all over the world, to focus on its traditional business, natural gas transportation and production.206\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 3.\n\n*(iv) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the Alleged Expropriation of El Paso\u2019s Property Rights*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n265.\n\nAlthough the Claimant has complained about direct expropriation, it can be declared by the Tribunal from the outset, without extensive reasoning, that no such expropriation occurred. It is enough here to recall the definition given to direct expropriation by Professor Sacerdoti: \"the coercive appropriation by the State of private property, usually by means of individual administrative measures.\"207 In direct expropriation, there is a formal transfer of the title of ownership from the foreign investor to the State engaged in the expropriation or to a national company of that State, and it has never been asserted that the shares of El Paso in the Argentinian companies have been transferred by the State to itself or to another public or private company.\n\nGiorgio Sacerdoti, \"Bilateral Treaties and Multilateral Instruments on Investment Protection\", 269 *Collected Courses, Hague Academy of International Law* (1997), atp. 379.\n\n266.\n\nThus the only question which remains is whether there has been an indirect expropriation, which concept will be considered as including \"measures tantamount to expropriation.\"208\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 530, 533, 535.\n\n*(a) Analysis of the Claim of the Alleged Expropriation of Legal and Contractual Rights of the Argentinian Companies*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nAccording to the Claimant,\n\n\"... the GOA undertook a policy that... effectively expropriated CAPEX\u2019s and COSTANERA\u2019s contractual right to receive Dollar-denominated prices for their sale of electricity and liquid hydrocarbons... The GOA measures also expropriated SERVICIOS\u2019 rights to receive Dollar-denominated payments under the Gas Processing Agreement.\"209\n\nThe Claimant reiterated that position later in its Memorial, when stating that \"the GOA\u2019s measures deprived CAPSA, CAPEX and Costanera of the exercise of their vested legal and contractual rights, which were abrogated and repudiated by the GOA.\"210 The Tribunal does not need to decide if this could be an expropriation, as it has no jurisdiction over the Argentinian companies and can only rule on an expropriation of the foreign investor\u2019s rights.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 305.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 416.\n\n268.\n\nThe same reasoning must apply to the claim that sums owed to CAPEX and CAPSA were in fact transformed into contributions to the Stabilization Fund, and subsequently into stock of a new power plant to be financed with the proceeds to this Fund, which plant will be operated by the Government. El Paso considers this as \"a forceful novation of the receivables owed by CAMMESA to the generators, which amounts to a confiscatory action that interferes with the ability of the generators to operate their own business.\"211 These are rights belonging to the Argentinian companies, over which the Tribunal has no jurisdiction, and not to El Paso. In addition, the Tribunal is inclined to consider that a change in the form of a credit cannot amount to a confiscation.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 320.\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to emphasise next that, if this point had to be decided, it would certainly be difficult to find an expropriation of the rights of the Argentinian companies. In effect, the impugned measures adopted in connection with the oil and electric power generation industries did not substantially deprive the Claimant of the use of and profits from its investment. On the contrary, the Argentinian companies continue operating and earning profits despite the crisis. For example, CAPSA had income in the amount of over ARS 111 million in 2003.212 CAPSA, CAPEX, Costanera and Gasoducto del Pac\u00edfico are still operating on the Argentine market and their survival is not in danger. SERVICIOS was absorbed by CAPEX, which is still profitable in the LPG processing business. According to the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, CAPSA\u2019s Financial Statements show that \"[i]ncome in 2006 is more than 10 time higher [in US$] than the company\u2019s income in 1997, when El Paso acquired interests in CAPSA.\"213\n\nSee Claimant\u2019s Document Production of 3 August 2006, Annex C, CAPSA\u2019s 2003 Financial Statements, p. 5.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 52.\n\n*(b) Analysis of the Sale of El Paso\u2019s Shares in the Argentinian Companies as an Alleged Expropriation*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal must ascertain a last point, which is whether the sale was or was not the automatic consequence, *i.e.* the only and unavoidable consequence, of the measures taken by the GOA, so as to be equivalent to an outright expropriation, as contended by the Claimant in its Memorial:\n\n\"These measures *amount to an expropriation* of El Paso\u2019s investment, violate commitments to Claimant and constitute unfair and inequitable treatment in violation of the BIT, international law and Argentina law.\n\nDue to these measures, *El Paso was forced to sell* its investments in the Argentina Companies at prices that represented less than 10% of El Paso\u2019s investment.\"214\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant reverts to this idea under the title \"Argentina Expropriated Claimant\u2019s Investment:\"\n\n\"In its Memorial, Claimant demonstrated the various ways in which Argentina\u2019s measures violated the BIT\u2019s prohibition against expropriating without compensation, whether directly or indirectly by measures tantamount to expropriation. These include:... (iii) taking measures... compelling El Paso to sell its interests in the Argentine Companies for less than 15% of what would have been their value in the absence of the measures.\"215\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 36. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\nReply, \u00a7 422.\n\n271.\n\nThe Respondent, on the contrary, insists that causes other than the Argentinian measures explain the sale of the shares of El Paso:\n\n\"The cause for El Paso\u2019s losses is not related in any way to the measures but to the time in which it was forced (due to its own issues) to sell its assets in Argentina. Had it not faced the serious issues that it underwent globally, El Paso would have profited from the gradual improvement in Argentina\u2019s conditions, by the increase in oil and gas prices around the world, and by the *normalisation* of the Argentine economy.\"216\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 12. Emphasis added by the Respondent.\n\n272.\n\nThe Tribunal has thus to examine the question of whether the sale was \"freely\" entered into or whether it was effectively \"compulsory,\" intrinsically linked to Argentina\u2019s measures, in such a way that it was the only possible consequence of these measures. Only if the sale was the only possible consequence of the Argentinian measures could one consider that these measures were expropriatory as they entailed a loss of control directly attributable to Argentina. In order to answer the question raised by the contradictory views of the Parties on that issue, the Tribunal will scrutinise the context of the sale and look into contemporary or subsequent public statements emanating from El Paso. The Tribunal has closely examined the different documents contemporaneous with the sale or subsequent to it in order to ascertain the causes of the sale, among others the reports to the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), usually considered as one of the main sources of information for the market relating to companies.\n\n273.\n\nA first point to be made is that the measures adopted after the sale of El Paso\u2019s shares, of which the Claimant repeatedly complains, cannot be considered as a cause of such sale, being subsequent to it. Therefore, the Tribunal will not take into account, for ascertaining the causes of the sale, the numerous measures adopted after the sale complained of by El Paso, among which a few can be mentioned: Resolution SE N\u00b0 826/2004, which invited the power generators to a mandatory conversion of their unpaid receivables for energy sales and future gross margins into either (i) equity in two new power plants or (ii) a Government monetary commitment that would become payable in 10-year instalments from the revenues of the two new power plants once they become operational; Law N\u00b0 26,095, dated 26 April 2006, which authorises the Executive Branch to apply \"charges\" to electricity and gas distribution tariffs to finance \"new\" investments in the energy sector; Law No. 26,217, published on 16 January 2007, which extended the export taxes through 2012;217 various measures imposed on the electricity sector after 2003; and export withholdings imposed and extended on various dates from 2004-2007.\n\nCPHB, \u00a7 79.\n\n274.\n\nIt is worth noting that in its 2005 Annual Report filed with the SEC, no mention was made by the Claimant itself either of the deterioration in the economic conditions of Argentina nor of any adverse regulatory changes in Argentina to explain the restructuring of El Paso and the sale of the shares in the Argentinian companies.218 In its 2004 Report,219 the focus was also on general problems, with no specific mention of any adverse measures taken by the GOA.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 63, citing EDGARonline, Excerpt from a 10-K/A SEC Filing, filed by EL PASO CORP/DE on 4/8/2005.

Respondent\u2019s Exhibit RA 144, p. 48.\n\n275.\n\nIt is true that in the 2002 and 2003 Reports to SEC, El Paso mentioned the economic situation of Argentina, but only the Argentinian economic crisis, more specifically \"the deteriorating economic conditions\" in the country, with no specific reference made to measures adopted by the Government, in contrast to what was done for other countries, and more specifically for its power generators in Australia, where the Claimant explained its divestiture by \"regulatory difficulties.\" In the same 2003 Report, a world-wide change in strategy of El Paso was announced.\n\n276.\n\nThe Tribunal has taken note of the fact that, according to Argentina, \"[i]t was the Claimant\u2019s decision to sell its assets in the country in the worst time of the Argentine crisis, in the need for facing its own global crisis, which caused the damage alleged by El Paso.\"220 Indeed, it appears from the file that El Paso has sold assets worldwide in 2002 and 2003, among others:\n\n(a) all the businesses related to electric power generation in the United States;221\n\n(b) all the assets and investments in the electric power generation business around the world, except for Brazil;222\n\n(c) all of El Paso\u2019s petroleum businesses;223\n\n(d) all the business related to LNG development;224\n\n(e) the assets located in Canada, Indonesia, and Hungary;225\n\n(f) El Paso\u2019s interest in GulfTerra and all the assets related to processing and storage in the south of Texas;226\n\n(g) the storage units located in Wyoming;227\n\n(h) the *midstream* assets located in the Mid-Continent and Northern Louisiana regions;228\n\n(i) the long-haul and metro dark fiber business;229\n\n(j) the asphalt business;230 and\n\n(k) El Paso\u2019s interest in the ECK generation project in the Czech Republic.231\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 788.\n\n2003 El Paso Report filed with the SEC, *supra* note 219, p. 3.\n\n*Ibid, y.* 3 n.l.\n\n*Ibid,*,p. 20.\n\nEl Paso Corporation, 2002 Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(D) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 filed at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission [hereinafter 2002 El Paso Report filed with the SEC].

In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the global situation of El Paso worldwide as well as that of the Argentine economy and the measures taken by Argentina are elements to be taken into account to explain the sale.\n\n278.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that El Paso did not suffer any interference with its property, as is shown by the fact that it could decide what to do with it and chose to sell its shares. Argentina did not confiscate the Claimant\u2019s shareholdings in the Argentinian companies. It is therefore the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that El Paso did not suffer any major interference with its property rights, as is evidenced by the fact that it decided to sell its shares; thus the Tribunal cannot find that there was an indirect expropriation.\n\n279.\n\nThe fact that no direct automatic causal link is recognised by the Tribunal between Argentina\u2019s measures and the sale has important consequences for the evaluation of possible damages owed to El Paso. More precisely, although the sale, in other words the quasi-total loss of El Paso\u2019s investment, was not an unavoidable and direct consequence of Argentina\u2019s measures, and cannot be the basis of a claim for expropriation, it must still be ascertained whether, if the measures breach another standard of protection of the BIT, compensation should be granted for the contribution of those measures to the loss of value of the shares at the time of the sale, if it is demonstrated that they had a detrimental effect on that value. If some of the impugned measures violating BIT standards made the sale less profitable, the Tribunal considers that the Claimant should receive compensation.\n\n280.\n\nIt must to be noted, therefore, that it is indeed quite possible to consider, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, that the sale of El Paso\u2019s investments in Argentina was not an expropriation, as it was not exclusively determined by Argentinian measures, and yet to conclude that those measures were the prevailing cause of the sale and, therefore, if the Tribunal finds this to be a violation of the FET, that the Respondent can be held responsible for damage resulting from this violation.\n\nC. Indirect Expropriation in Relation to Article XII on Tax Matters\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nIt is worth noting that at first sight the Claimant\u2019s Memorial looks as if El Paso had not included the tax withholdings among the expropriatory acts of Argentina. This is what results from the table of contents, under the heading \"The GOA\u2019s Expropriatory Acts\":\n\n(i) Abrogation and repudiation of contractual rights\n\n(ii) Withholdings of hydrocarbon exports\n\n(iii) Violation of right to collect payments as promised\n\n(iv) Pesification of capacity payments at an artificial exchange rate\n\n(v) Fundamental alteration of the price-setting mechanism for electrical generators\n\n(vi) Pesification of VCPs at an artificial exchange rate\n\n(vii) Violation of right to dispose freely of production\n\n(viii) Failure to mitigate impact of Law N\u00b0 25,561\n\n(ix) Restrictions on deductions for losses from Law N\u00b0 25,561\n\n(x) Interference with crude oil sales.\n\nHowever, the tax measures enacted from 2002 onward are complained of under three of these headings.\n\n282.\n\nFirstly, under the heading \"Withholdings 0f hydrocarb on exports,\" El Paso is in fact complaining about \"Withholdings *on* hydrocarbon exports,\" alleging that violation of the right to *export freely* hydrocarbons *includes* the right to *export hydrocarbons free of export withholdings.* And the Claimant concludes that \"Export Withholdings on crude oil constitute (i) a direct taking of export revenues of CAPSA and CAPEX and (ii) an indirect taking from [sic] by artificially depressing domestic crude oil and LPG prices.\"232\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 474.\n\n283.\n\nSecondly, under the heading \"Failure to mitigate impact of Law N\u00b0 25,561,\" El Paso explains that, with the devaluation of the peso and the inflation deriving therefrom - that reached 118% in 2002 -, the non-recognition of inflation for tax depreciation purposes was unreasonable and confiscatory. As a result, there has been an expropriation: according to the Claimant, the policy of the Government \"artificially diluted the amount of depreciation that the CAPEX [sic] and COSTANERA are allowed to claim for tax purposes, thus resulting in confiscatory taxation and a taking of revenues.\"233\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 493.\n\n284.\n\nThirdly, under the heading \"Restrictions on deductions for losses from Law N\u00b0 25,561,\" El Paso also complains about tax measures. More specifically it states that \"[t]he GOA unreasonably limited the tax deductions of the Argentine Companies in light of the significant losses caused by the devaluation of the Peso.\"234\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 494.\n\n285.\n\nThe two last claims of expropriation are based on the idea that a foreign investor has a right to certain tax deductions. This was asserted by the Claimant when it stated that\n\n\"[w]hile it is fair and reasonable for an investor to expect that no inflation adjustment be used in a low inflation environment, it is also reasonable that the same investor can expect that inflation will be recognized for tax depreciation purposes in the context of high inflation such as occurred in 2002.\"235\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 369.\n\n286.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the claims regarding tax issues in the BIT are limited to assumptions of expropriation, transfers, or investment agreements. Analysing the question of whether there could be a finding of expropriation, Argentina states first the general principle according to which a State is free to modify its tax regime. Only if excessive taxes with a confiscatory effect equivalent to an expropriation are imposed may international law be deemed to have been violated. Following this general approach, the Respondent argues that\n\n\"[t]he creation of export duties on oil and gas within the context of the crisis is a reasonable governmental regulation. The regulations issued in connection with income tax [and those not issued] are also a part of Argentina\u2019s freedom *to act in the broader public interest through new or modified tax regimes''236*\n\nMoreover, in the view of Argentina, the limited impact of the taxes could by no means be equivalent to an expropriation:\n\n\"Exports duties of 16.67% on oil and gas did not deprive El Paso from the benefits of its investment *completely or in a significant portion.* On the contrary, the increase in international oil and gas prices and the fall in costs resulting from the mega-devaluation of the peso allowed oil and gas producing companies to increase their benefits *significantly,* even when paying export duties.\"237\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 486. Emphasis by the Respondent.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 495. Emphasis by the Respondent\n\n287.\n\nAs far as the deductions from taxations are concerned, Argentina stresses that a decision was taken in 1992, well before the Emergency Law, which simply did not modify the existing arrangement. This is acknowledged by the Claimant in its Memorial, where it admits that:\n\n\"Law N\u00b0 24,073, enacted on February 4, 1992, froze all applicable indices and provisions for inflation adjustment purposes, including those related to tax depreciation, as from April 1, 1992. This was a reasonable measure at the time there was hardly any inflation in Argentina.\"238\n\nWhat El Paso complains about, therefore, is not a change in the law but a change in the economic circumstances:\n\n\"Law N\u00b0 24,073 ceased to be appropriate in January 2002 when Law N\u00b0 25,561 repealed the Convertibility Law and the GOA took a number of measures that caused a huge devaluation of the Peso... This sudden and unexpected change of circumstances materially altered the context in which the freezing of inflation indices for tax purposes had been issued pursuant to Law N\u00b0 24,073.\"239\n\nArgentina contends that it is not possible for El Paso to demand \"an economic compensation because the applicable tax system has not been modified since 2002 according to what it considers convenient.\"240 Moreover, the two claims related to deductions from the tax basis were only brought for CAPEX and Costanera, and according to Argentina, neither of these two companies paid taxes in the years before the sale of El Paso\u2019s shares.241\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 366\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 367.\n\nCounter Memorial, \u00a7 450.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 459 and 477. See also \u00a7 32: \"CAPSA does not pay income tax because it would be exempt therefrom since 1999.\"\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s conclusion is thus that, there being no expropriation, the tax measures do not come under the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction according to the BIT. This has far-reaching consequences, according to Argentina, as it contends that 93% of the claims are based on export withholdings.242\n\nRPHB, \u00a7 162.\n\n***2. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Tribunal\u2019s Legal Analysis of the Applicable Principles*\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nArticle XII of the BIT provides:\n\n\"1. With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the other Party.\n\n2. Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Articles VII and VIII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article IV;\n\n(b) transfers, pursuant to Article V; or\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VII (1) (a) or (b), to the extent they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable period of time.\"\n\n290.\n\nThe tax policy of a country is a matter relating to the sovereign power of the State and its power to impose taxes on its territory. The Tribunal agrees that the State has a sovereign right to enact the tax measures it deems appropriate at any particular time. Every year, governments around the world propose the adoption of tax measures which constitute either new initiatives or amendments to the existing fiscal legislation. There is a presumption of validity in favour of legislative measures adopted by a State, and it is up to those who challenge such measures to demonstrate their invalidity. This idea has been embodied in Article XII of the BIT, the effect of which is to only limit slightly the State\u2019s power to levy taxes.\n\n291.\n\nAs Article XII grants an important margin of freedom to the host State in relation to its fiscal policy towards foreign investors, the States Parties indicate in paragraph 2 of Article XII that this policy should not be unfair or inequitable. Considering both the language used - \"each Party should strive\" - and the fact that Article XII (2) excludes, except in specific and limited cases, any review of a possible violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, the Tribunal concludes that Article XII (1) creates only a best-effort obligation.\n\n292.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the present Tribunal has already decided that the duties imposed on exports \"are a tax measure,\"243 and this conclusion is reiterated here. The Tribunal also found that it had limited jurisdiction over only three issues:\n\n\"The Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over tax matters, but only insofar as the tax measures complained of are linked with: (a) expropriation, pursuant to Article IV; (b) transfers, pursuant to Article V; or (c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VII(1)(a) or (b). In other words, the only claims that the Tribunal can consider at the merits stage are the tax claims based on the existence of an expropriation and on the violation of an investment agreement or authorization. Everything else is beyond the competence of the Tribunal.\"244\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, *supra* note 58, \u00a7 112.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 116.\n\n293.\n\nSince El Paso did not file any claim in connection with transfers (point b), and since the Tribunal has already decided245 that there is no investment agreement benefiting El Paso (point c), the only issue which remains to be addressed is whether such taxes could qualify as an expropriation (point a).\n\nSee *supra* \u00a7\u00a7 190-198.\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the Facts of the Case*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n294.\n\nA significant portion of El Paso\u2019s claims are related to tax issues. These issues include the claims related to the export duties established by the Emergency Law and the deductions on income tax. Like any other activity, foreign investments are subject to taxes imposed by the host State and \"the foreign investor has neither the right nor any legitimate expectation that the tax regime will not change... during the period of the investment,\"246 even though that may reduce its economic benefits, except if a stabilisation of the tax regime (at least for certain taxes) was agreed on by the State.\n\n*EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador* [hereinafter *EnCana],* UNCITRAL, LCIA Case No. UN348l, Award of 3 February 2006, \u00a7 173.\n\n295.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine the different tax measures complained of and will summarily dismiss the claims against the regime of tax deductions which was in place since 1992, as there were no complaints from the Claimant during ten years. In this arbitration, the Claimant does not complain about a change of the law; it complains about \"no change in the law.\" The only claim here is that the State has not modified its laws in order to alleviate the economic problems resulting for the economic actors from the new economic situation. Without needing to enter into a discussion on this point, the Tribunal seriously doubts that, as alleged by the Claimant, \"[i]nvestors have a reasonable and legitimate expectation to be able to adjust their fixed assets for tax purposes in periods of high inflation \"247 A State cannot be considered to have a duty to adapt its tax regime to the best interests of foreign investors. An unfavourable calculation of taxes cannot be equated with an expropriation, especially as the Claimant has not quantified its alleged losses.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 362.\n\n296.\n\nThe Tribunal will now look into the export-tax withholdings in order to decide whether they can be considered an expropriation. Before analysing them, it is appropriate to recall the content of the impugned measures. First, the Emergency Law adopted on 6 January 2002 decided on the principle of such a tax, known as withholding on oil and gas:\n\n\"The Executive Branch of Government shall be entitled to establish compensatory measures to avoid the unbalancing of financial institutions resulting from the provisions set forth in the preceding paragraph. These measures may include the issue of guaranteed national public bonds in foreign currency. For purpose of funding such guarantee, *an export tax on hydrocarbons is hereby created* for the term of FIVE (5) years, and the Executive Branch of Government shall be entitled to determine the corresponding tax rate.\"248\n\nThen, as far as *crude oil exports* were concerned, on 13 February 2002, the GOA enacted Decree N\u00b0 310/2002, which placed a 20% withholding on crude oil exports: this amounts to a 16.67% export duty on crude oil exports249, as in Argentina the withholding is included in the amount used to calculate export duties and, therefore, a 20% export duty implies an actual 16.67% withholding.250 Such export duty began to be levied on 1 March 2002 and was still effective when El Paso sold its equity interests in the Argentinian companies.\n\nRegarding *LPG exports,* a new tax was imposed on 13 May 2002: during a term of fifteen days in 2002 (from 14 May through 31 May 2002), a 20% export duty was also applied to LPG exports,251 which implies, for the same reason as stated above, a 16.67% export withholding. From 1 June 2002 onward, the duty was reduced to 4.76% as a result of the Agreement for the Stabilisation of the Liquefied Petroleum Gas Wholesale Price in the Argentine Market (hereinafter: the LPG Price Stabilisation Agreement). This Agreement was entered into in July 2002 between the Minister of Economy and the main LPG producers in Argentina. One of the companies that signed the agreement was CAPEX. From the execution of the LPG Price Stabilisation Agreement until May 2004, the LPG export duty remained at 4.76%. El Paso sold its equity interests in CAPSA - and, consequently, in CAPEX - in mid-2003, and in Costanera in autumn 2003. This reduced export duty was therefore still effective at the moment of the two sales in June and September 2003.\n\nLaw No. 25,561 (Emergency Law), Title IV, Chapter I, Art. 6 \u00a7 2. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\nSee Presidential Decree No. 310/2002 of 13 February 2002, Section 1. See also Presidential Decree No. 809/02, Section 3. The tariff positions established in regulations are defined in the Mercosur (Southern Common Market) Common Nomenclature, approved by Presidential Decree No. 2,275/94.\n\nThis was acknowledged by LECG. See LECG Report, n. 69. See also MacroConsulting Report, \u00a7 178.\n\nSee Presidential Decree No. 809/02 of 13 May 2005, Sections 2 and 3.\n\n297.\n\nTurning now to the analysis of these measures, the Tribunal considers, first, that the creation of export duties on oil and gas is *a reasonable governmental regulation within the context of the crisis.* According to the Respondent\u2019s expert Roubini, \"it made total economic sense to have a \u2018compensated devaluation\u2019 by relying on export taxes to raise revenues in the sectors that had most benefited from the devaluation.\"252 The devaluation of the peso entailed extraordinary revenues for the exporting sectors which did not arise from increased efficiency but from the devaluation. It is thus logical to establish a tax on exports to be levied on a portion of this extraordinary income. By mid-2002, the Argentine peso had lost 200% against the US dollar. At the same time, the price of oil climbed; as stated by Argentina,\n\n\"[f]rom mid-1998 (when recession started in Argentina) to mid-2003 (when El Paso sold its share in CAPSA and in Servicios), the WTI crude oil barrel rose from below USD 13/bbl to over USD 30/bbl, even peaking over USD 35/bbl.\"253\n\nFaced with this new economic situation, the export duties imposed on oil and gas amounted to only between 4.76% and 16.67%. According to the Tribunal, this may be regarded as reasonable. Therefore, the tax on unexpected income, resulting from the mega-devaluation of the Argentine peso and the increase in the international price of oil cannot be considered an expropriation. In this sense, the Tribunal is supported in its analysis by the approach followed in *Aminoil v. Kuwait,*254 where the tribunal noted that it was acceptable to impose taxes on the oil industry in connection with unexpected income attributable to the \"explosion\" of oil prices rather than to efforts made by the concession holders.\n\nCounter Memorial, \u00a7 153, citing the Expert Report by Nouriel Roubini [hereinafter Roubini Report! of 24 August 2006, \u00a7 42.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 423.\n\n*American Independent Oil Company (Aminoil) v. Kuwait,* [hereinafter *Aminoil],* Award of 24 March 1982, *66ILR* 518 (1984).\n\n298.\n\nSecond, the tax measures had only a *limited impact on Claimant\u2019s property rights.* On crude oil, the withholdings were fixed at 20% (16.67%). On LPG, the rate, first established at 20% (16.67%), was later reduced to 5% (4.46%). Only after El Paso\u2019s sale, on 13 May 2004, did Argentina increase the export withholdings imposed on crude oil from 20% to 25% and on LPG exports from 5% to 20%, and reinstated the previously abolished withholdings on exports of gasoline and other by-products at a rate of 5%. A first remark is that the export withholdings imposed in May 2004 cannot have caused a forced sale constituting an expropriation of El Paso\u2019s shares in the Argentinian companies subjected to these withholdings, or constitute an expropriation by themselves. A second remark is that, without needing to enter into sophisticated reasoning or calculations, it is obvious that a tax of such a percentage is by no means an unreasonable measure that could be deemed expropriatory: under no circumstances may a tax of under 20% on exports be characterised as expropriation of an investment. The impact of the imposition of export withholdings, at a rate of 4.76% for LPG and a rate of 16.67% for oil, on El Paso\u2019s shares cannot be deemed to be expropriatory.\n\n299.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tribunal, having analysed the different tax measures, does not consider that they amount to indirect expropriation, as they were reasonable and did not result in the neutralisation of the property rights of the Claimant.\n\nD. Article II(2)(b): Discriminatory and Arbitrary Treatment\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nArticle II(2)(b) of the 1991 BIT states:\n\n\"Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For the purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VII and VIII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.\"\n\n***1. Discriminatory Treatment: Has El Paso Been Discriminated Against?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Parties\u2019 Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n301.\n\nAccording to the Claimant\u2019s Memorial, the energy companies were discriminated against:\n\n\"... the GOA\u2019s measures have been designed to benefit other sectors of the economy at the expense of energy companies, thus constituting a politically-motivated and discriminatory transfer of wealth from energy companies to other sectors of the economy;\"255\n\n\"... in an obvious display of discrimination, the GOA effectively took billions of Dollars from the energy sector and transferred that money to other economic groups;\"256\n\n\"... [t]he Energy Secretariat\u2019s acts were driven by the GOA\u2019s decision to manipulate energy prices in order to disproportionately distribute the damage caused by the GOA\u2019s alterations to the system so that generators shouldered a larger burden than other participants.\"257\n\nThe same position was taken in the Claimant\u2019s Reply:\n\n\"... the measures adopted by the GOA regarding the energy sector were not a mere result of Argentina\u2019s economic condition, but part of a specific policy adopted by the GOA to discriminate against the energy sector, abrogating fundamental rights and assurances granted under the Energy Regulatory Framework.\"258\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 35.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 223.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 237.\n\nReply, \u00a7 353.\n\n302.\n\nAnd the discrimination is described as follows:\n\n\"Many of Argentina\u2019s measures had a *disproportionate effect* on foreign investors in the energy sector and thus constitute a clear case of *de facto* discrimination... Essentially, Argentina forced the energy sector to bear a disproportionate brunt of Argentina\u2019s financial difficulties in order to cross-subsidize the rest of its economy by US$ 10.7 billion.\"259\n\n*Ibid.* \u00a7 670. Emphasis by the Claimant.\n\n303.\n\nThe Respondent presented a different view of what constituted unauthorised discrimination. The GOA considered that the measures were not discriminatory and expressed the following view on the conditions for measures to be discriminatory:\n\n\"The differential treatment between national and foreign investors does not necessarily lead to the violation of international law standards. In order for a State\u2019s action or measure to be discriminatory in the sense that it is prohibited under international law, two requirements should be present. In the first place, the measure must result in actual damages to the foreign investor; in the second place, the action or measure must have been taken to harm the foreign investor. If these requirements are not present, there will be no discriminatory action by the State that is protected by international law.\"260\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 659.\n\n304.\n\nIn addition to this abstract view of what constitutes discrimination, Argentina contended that, according to the facts of the case, the energy and oil and gas companies had not been concretely discriminated against. According to the Respondent,\n\n\"[a]ll the sectors of the economy were impacted by the crisis and had to adapt to the new context. El Paso has filed a claim for investments related to electric power generation and oil and gas production. Although these sectors could not remain alien to the crisis, they were not, at any rate, among the most disfavoured ones.\"261\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 9.\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n305.\n\nOn the one hand, the Tribunal does not agree with Argentina\u2019s contention that discriminatory intent is necessary for a measure to be discriminatory. It is sufficient that, objectively, two similar situations are not treated similarly. As stated by the ICSID tribunal in *Goetz v. Burundi,* \"discrimination supposes a differential treatment applied to people who are in similar situations.\"262 Professor Kenneth Vandevelde further explains that anti-discrimination provisions in BITs prohibit measures that are \"discriminatory in effect as well as those which are intentionally discriminatory,\"263 which implies that while discriminatory intent gives rise to a finding of discrimination, the discriminatory effect of a measure is sufficient for such a finding. On the other hand, the Tribunal can also not accept the Claimant\u2019s view according to which any discrimination against an investor is a violation of the BIT. The Claimant has cited many authorities and stated that, according to Professor A. F. M. Maniruzzaman,\n\n\"[t]he concept of discrimination entails two elements: first, the measures directed against a particular party must be for reasons unrelated to the substance of the matter, for example, the company\u2019s nationality. Second, discrimination entails like persons being treated in an inequivalent manner.\"264\n\n*Goetz, supra* note 129, Award of 10 February 1999, \u00a7 121 : *\"Une discrimination suppose un traitement diff\u00e9rentiel appliqu\u00e9 \u00e0 des personnes se trouvant dans des situations semblables.\"*\n\nKenneth J. Vandevelde, *United States Investment Treaties: Policy and Practice,* Boston, Kluwer Law and Taxation, 1992, p. 77.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 556, citing A. F. M. Maniruzzaman, \"Expropriation of Alien Property and the Principle of Non-Discrimination in International Law of Foreign Investment: An Overview\", 8 J. *Transnat\u2019l L. &Pol\u2019y 57* (1998) (footnote omitted). Claimant\u2019s Legal Authority No.133.\n\n306.\n\nThe protection against discrimination in the BIT is a protection against discrimination of foreign investors as such. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the standard of the BIT according to which *foreign investors* are protected against discrimination does not entail the far-reaching consequence that a State cannot treat differently the economic actors in different sectors of the economy, as long as this differential treatment applies equally to national and foreign investors. None of the impugned measures adopted to face the economic crisis differentiated in legal terms between Argentinian nationals or companies, on the one hand, and foreigners or foreign or foreign-owned companies, on the other. It appears moreover from the file that, in practice, no foreign investor has received treatment different from that granted to its Argentinian counterparts, and El Paso has received the same treatment as other investors in the same sector.\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal has not been convinced by the Claimant allegation that\n\n\"... the measures adopted by the GOA regarding the energy sector were not a mere result of Argentina\u2019s economic condition, but part of a specific policy adopted by the GOA to discriminate against the energy sector, abrogating fundamental rights and assurances granted under the Energy Regulatory Framework.\"265\n\nReply, \u00a7 353.\n\n308.\n\nThe conclusion of this Tribunal is that no *de jure* discrimination between national and foreign investors, or different foreign nationals, resulted from the measures adopted to face the crisis.\n\n309.\n\nThe question that remains is whether there has been *de facto* discrimination. According to the Claimant, the banks are mainly Argentinian and the oil and gas sector companies mainly foreign-owned: as the banking sector and the energy sector have not been treated in the same manner, there has been *de facto* discrimination according to the Claimant.\n\n310.\n\nIt has been said, and is indeed confirmed by the text of the relevant law, that the export withholdings were established to compensate for the difficulties of the Argentinian banking sector. According to the Claimant,\n\n\"... [t]he mandatory conversion of Dollar-denominated bank deposits and bank credits created an imbalance in the system that was termed *asymmetrical pesification.* This imbalance occurred because Decree N\u00b0 214 converted Dollar-denominated bank deposits into Pesos at a rate of US$ 1 = per Arg.$1.40, while Dollar-denominated bank loans were converted into Argentine currency at a rate of US$ 1 = Arg$ 1. According to Law N\u00b0 25,561, the hydrocarbon export withholding was created to compensate the banking sector for this imbalance.\"266\n\nIt is not denied that the banking and the hydrocarbon sectors were not subject to the same measures, but the Tribunal thinks that the measures concerning each of these sectors were reasonable and did not discriminate against either of them. On the contrary, the overall scheme adopted by the Argentine Government had the objective of balancing for each sector the advantages and disadvantages of the general economic situation.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 329.\n\n311.\n\nThe banking sector was at a disadvantage because the Government had imposed an asymmetrical pesification, the loans being pesified at a lower exchange rate than the deposits, which created a greater loss for the banking system than symmetrical pesification would have. This was acknowledged by the tribunal in the award in *Continental* when it analysed the same Decree:\n\n\"The Government intervened massively to support the banks in the asymmetric pesification. This scheme would have brought the banks otherwise to bankruptcy, since they had to \u2018pay back\u2019 to depositors 1.40 pesos for each dollar, while their credits were converted at 1:1.\"267\n\nThis is a very specific application of pesification which placed the banks in a situation that cannot be considered as similar or comparable to that of the oil and gas companies but, on the contrary, was less favourable. The GOA practised discrimination in favour of the banks and then a sort of reverse discrimination to equalise the playground. In other words, what Decree N\u00b0 214 and Law N\u00b0 25,561 did was what is called in another context *\"in\u00e9galit\u00e9 compensatrice\"268* and does not amount to discriminatory treatment of foreign investors.\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 144.\n\nAt the time of the New International Economic Order (NIEO), the idea was to give advantages to developing countries in order to foster a more balanced relationship with developed countries. The idea was for example expressed in Article 18 of the Charter for Economic Rights and Duties of States, embodied in General Assembly Resolution 3182 of December 1974, which reads: \"Developed countries should extend, improve and enlarge the system of generalized non-reciprocal and non-discriminatory tariff preferences to the developing countries consistent with the relevant agreed conclusions and relevant decisions as adopted on this subject, in the framework of the competent international organizations. Developed countries should also give serious consideration to the adoption of other differential measures, in areas where this is feasible and appropriate and in ways which will provide special and more favourable treatment, in order to meet the trade and development needs of the developing countries. In the conduct of international economic relations, the developed countries should endeavour to avoid measures having a negative effect on the development of the national economies of the developing countries, as promoted by generalized tariff preferences and other generally agreed differential measures in their favour.\"\n\n312.\n\nThe same analysis was made in *Metalpar v. Argentina,* where the claimants -two companies which had invested in Argentinian companies engaged in the manufacturing of bus bodies - alleged that Argentina, through Law No. 25,561, Law No. 25,789, and Presidential Decree No. 905/2002, had discriminated against them in favour of the financial sector, just as El Paso claims to have been discriminated against in favour of the banking sector. The answer of the tribunal was simple and is shared by this Tribunal:\n\n\"The Tribunal considers that a State\u2019s power to create its legal system - through its competent authorities - allows it to establish different rules to govern different subjects. If Claimants neither were nor are financial institutions, they cannot argue that the Argentine Government should have treated them as such.\"269\n\n*Metalpar SA. and Buen Aire SA. v. Argentine Republic* [hereinafter *Metalpar],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/5), Award of 6 June 2008, \u00a7 161.\n\n313.\n\nMoreover, as far as the Hydrocarbon Sector was concerned, the exports being expressed in dollars and the costs in Argentina being sustained in pesos, the hydrocarbon companies seemed to be in a more favourable position than those which did not export. Argentina argued that \"[w]ithholdings captured only one portion of the extraordinary profitability obtained by exporters, who had suddenly benefited as a result of the mega-devaluation of the local currency.\"270 The Tribunal here refers to a statement by Mr. Fernandez, who declared in February 2004, when he was Chief of Cabinet:\n\n\"We are referring to various sectors of the economy which shall bear the cost of this increase, most of them are exporters who have enjoyed the possibility to export their products in dollars while paying a very low tariff for gas and electricity in pesos.\"271\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 255.\n\nStatement during a press conference given on 13 February 2004, by the Chief of Cabinet, Mr. Fernandez, Minister of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Service, Mr. De Vido, and the Secretary of Energy, Mr. Cameron. Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 125.\n\n314.\n\nThe Tribunal also takes note of a statement made by the Claimant itself, making the same analysis when saying that \"those who export their production... benefited from the devaluation of the Peso since the Peso equivalent value of their exports tripled.\"272 It was thus reasonable for the Government to institute a tax on the unexpected profits made by the oil and gas companies to re-balance the situation of the banking sector. Far from being discriminatory, this measure aimed at equalising the playground of the different economic actors, by distributing more equitably the burden of the country\u2019s economic crisis among all those affected. This idea was indeed spelled out in Section 11 of the Emergency Law, which pointed to \"the principle of shared efforts.\" To these considerations one should add that it was common knowledge that at the time of the Argentine crisis the international price of oil increased tremendously, which was all to the benefit of the exporting companies. Argentina explained that\n\n\"[i]n the oil and gas sector, export duties were established levied only on a minor portion of the extraordinary profits generated by the mega devaluation of the Argentine peso for tradable goods producing sectors. The increase in the international price of crude oil was an additional issue that also benefited the sector dramatically. Domestic oil and gas prices increased at a pace that exceeded domestic inflation and converted this sector into one of the most favoured ones within the context of the crisis.\"273\n\nTherefore, as stated by Mr. Roubini, expert for the Respondent, \"it made total economic sense to have a \u2018compensated devaluation\u2019 by relying on export taxes to raise revenues in the sectors that had most benefited from the devaluation and the sectors that were most able to afford an increased tax imposition.\"274\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 244.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 10.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 153, citing the Roubini Report, *supra* note 253, \u00a7 47.\n\n315.\n\nIt is this Tribunal\u2019s view that a differential treatment based on the existence of a different factual and legal situation does not breach the BIT\u2019s standard. Here the Tribunal is in line with the approach of other tribunals already cited and finds itself in agreement with the tribunal in *Enron,* which found no discrimination between the different sectors of the economy, although they were indeed treated differently, as there was no \"capricious, irrational or absurd differentiation in the treatment accorded to the Claimant as compared to other entities or sectors.\"275 The Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not proved any improper differentiation.\n\n*Enron, supra* note 52, \u00a7 282.\n\n316.\n\nLast but not least, the Tribunal recalls that the application of standards in the BIT other than that of protection from expropriation is excluded for tax matters. The question that was discussed in the preceding paragraphs is therefore somewhat academic, although, if it had had to decide the issue, the Tribunal would have considered it important to state that, for the reasons presented, it held that there had been neither *de jure* nor *de facto* discrimination against El Paso during the Argentine crisis.\n\n***2. Arbitrary Treatment: Has El Paso Been Treated Arbitrarily?***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Parties\u2019 Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n317.\n\nThe Claimant argues in its Memorial that the decisions of the Argentinian authorities were arbitrary, but without really saying more than that \"the GOA took a series of politically-motivated measures,\"276 without elaborating on the possible political motives behind these measures. Later on, some explanation was given of this idea of political motivation in the testimony of Mr. Bastos, the former Secretary of Energy: \"the changes that have been introduced are political ones aimed mainly at preventing an increase in the price of energy...\"277\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 21.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 377, citing the Bastos Report.\n\n318.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the measures were not arbitrary and were designed to improve the global economic situation. They were adopted after extensive discussions in the Government and the ministries, and their sole aim was to face the crisis in the best way possible.\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n319.\n\n*Black\u2019s Law Dictionary* defines the word \"arbitrary\" as \"not governed by any fixed rules or standard,\" \"performed without adequate determination of principle,\" \"without cause based upon the law,\" or resulting from a \"failure to exercise honest judgment.\"278 In addition, \"arbitrary and capricious\" is defined as \"characterization of a decision or action taken by an administrative agency... [as] wilful and unreasonable action without consideration or in disregard of facts or law or without determining principle.\"279 According to international law, \"[arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law... It is a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.\"280\n\n*Black\u2019s Law Dictionary,* 6th ed. (1990), p. 104.\n\n*Ibid., p..* 105.\n\n*ELSI, supra* note 135, \u00a7 128.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no arbitrariness in Argentina\u2019s reaction to the crisis. Of course, if one is faced with a difficult economic situation, there are always several methods for dealing with it, depending on the circumstances, the political constraints incumbent on governments and their economic analyses. It is clear that neither the causes of, nor the answers to, Argentina\u2019s economic crisis at the end of 2001 have been the object of unanimous appraisal.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal has heard various experts, all knowledgeable, having opposite perceptions of the same reality. Some experts stated that the pesification was the only solution; others said that dollarisation would have been much preferable.281\n\nThere is no common analysis of the origin of the crisis, as was pointed out by the tribunal in the *CMS* case, which was dealing with the same crisis:\n\n\"This crisis... stemmed basically from economic conditions that made it impossible to maintain the fixed exchange rate and which gradually led to the greatest default on foreign debt in history and the collapse of the Argentine financial markets. Some tend to fault foreign investors and put the blame on excessive privatization and globalization, while others see in it the result of not having carried out the liberalization program in its entirety and having allowed major governmental interferences in the functioning of the economy.\"282\n\nIt cannot be denied also that the reactions to the crisis could have been different, as stated by the tribunal in *LG&E:*\n\n\"... Argentina faced severe economic and social hardships from 2001 onwards and had to react to the circumstances prevailing at the time. Even though the measures adopted by Argentina may not have been the best, they were not taken lightly, without due consideration.\"283\n\nSee for example, Reply, \u00a7 747, Claimant\u2019s developments on the subject: \"An additional alternative available to Argentina was \"dollarization.\" Argentina could have adopted the Dollar as legal tender, as other countries (such as Ecuador and Panama) did. Under this option, the Central Bank of Argentina could have used its Dollar reserves to exchange all pesos in circulation for dollars, and all Peso-denominated obligations would have been transformed into dollar-denominated obligations at the exchange rate of 1:1, which was the exchange rate in force during the currency board system. The peso was already pegged to the Dollar under the currency board system, and the Argentine Central Bank possessed the dollar reserves necessary to maintain that peg. \u2018Dollarization\u2019 was thus an obvious and logical alternative that was frequently discussed in 2001. It had the support of senior US officials, making it \"highly likely that had Argentina opted for dollarization, both the Bush Administration and the multilateral institutions would have supported the policy.\" (footnotes omitted.)\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 153.\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7 162.\n\n322.\n\nThe Tribunal thinks that the GOA certainly tried to take the best measures to cope with the situation. Judging whether the measures taken were or were not the best is very difficult as shown by the diverging views expressed on the subject by commentators of the Argentinian crisis of 2001. Something had to be done. The only item to be verified by the Tribunal is whether the measures were taken arbitrarily. In view of the extensive file before it, which it has studied exhaustively, it appears to the Tribunal that the measures adopted in the context of the crisis were not arbitrary but reasonable and consistent with the aim pursued. They were intended to face the extremely serious crisis that Argentina was going through and emanated from the police power regularly exercised by governments.\n\n323.\n\nIt is also apposite to note that all measures were taken in the framework of the existing constitutional order, as stressed by the tribunal in *Continental:*\n\n\"It is worth noting that ultimately the crisis did not affect the functioning of the democratic constitutional order of Argentina beyond emergency measures enacted on the basis of the Constitution. Civil liberties were not restricted, nor constitutional guarantees suspended. This is apparent now; but it certainly could not be assumed in late 2001 and 2002.\"284\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 153. Footnote omitted.\n\n324.\n\nIt could moreover be said that the subsequent evolution of the Argentinian economy might give some confirmation of the adequacy of the policy followed.285 The Claimant itself has recognised this positive evolution more than once. For example, in its Closing Statement, it was indicated that the GDP growth was the following: + 8.83 for 2003; + 9.03 for 2004; + 9.18 for 2005; + 8.46 for 2006; and approximately + 7.5 for 2008. Moreover, in a letter dated 20 May 2008 sent by its counsel to the Tribunal, the Claimant recognised the positive effects of Argentina\u2019s policies, stating that \"Argentina\u2019s economy has been growing at record rates since 2003.\" According to the Embassy of Argentina in Washington, D.C., \"Argentina\u2019s economy has been growing at a fast pace since 2003 (9% average during 2004-2006), having overcome its major crisis in modern history.\" In her first annual address to the Argentine Congress, President Cristina Kirchner characterised Argentina\u2019s record growth as \"the greatest growth period in Argentina in the last 100 years.\"\n\nSee for example, an article published in the French economic newspaper \"Les Echos\", 22-23 February 2008, with the Title \"Cinqui\u00e8me ann\u00e9e de forte croissance en Argentine,\" in which one can read: \"... The dynamism and the willpower for revenge of Argenhna, which recovered with a spectacular velocity from the terrible financial crisis that brought it down at the end of 2001, cannot be denied. \" Translation by the Tribunal.\n\n325.\n\nThe conclusion of the Tribunal is that the measures taken by Argentina were based on a reasoned scheme to answer a major crisis and effectively had the desired result, which means that they cannot be considered as tainted by arbitrariness.\n\nE. Article II(2)(a): Fair and Equitable Treatment\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nArticle Il(2)(a) of the BIT prescribes:\n\n\"Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.\"\n\n327.\n\nTwo main issues are raised by the application of the fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard in an arbitration case: the first concerns the relation of FET with general international law, whereas the second is the determination of its content and scope.\n\n***1. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThe Claimant has an all-encompassing conception of FET, as is shown by the summary of the development of this concept given in its Memorial:\n\n\"In summary, government measures violate the fair and equitable treatment standard when they are inconsistent with the reasonable and legitimate expectations of the parties. It is both reasonable and legitimate for investors to expect that a government will conform its conduct to accepted standards such as its own treaties, constitution, laws, regulations, customary international law, and general usage that falls into the category of a norm. Indeed, this is the essence of the rule of law. It is also unfair and inequitable for a government to violate the principles of honesty and good faith, to act in a non-transparent manner, to act in a manner inconsistent with representations and inducements offered to attract foreign investment, to revoke or alter arbitrarily or for political reasons regulatory approvals or conditions upon which the investor relied, to abuse its legal rights or its discretionary powers, to interfere with property rights unreasonably and to unforeseeably change the essential rules of the game upon which investors relied in such a way as to frustrate the very purpose of the investment. These standards are all fundamental and well accepted. They encompass the most elementary principles of fairness and economic morality, and in a practical sense, they are necessary preconditions for the confidence based upon the stability and predictability that comes with respect for the rule of law that is so necessary both to attract foreign investment and for any economy to prosper and grow.\"286\n\nWithout wishing to analyse at this stage the details of this conception of FET, the Tribunal notes that, in the Claimant\u2019s view as expressed in this excerpt, any violation by a State of any of its laws or its regulations is a violation of FET. In its Reply, the Claimant examined the relation between the concept of FET and general international law and contended that fair and equitable treatment as prescribed in the BIT established a different and higher standard than that prevailing in customary international law.287\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 525.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 540-552.\n\n329.\n\nThe Respondent began its discussion of FET by stating that \"[t]he treatment standards are provided by the international customary law minimum standard. This is thus established by the BIT, practice and international legal scholars.\"288 As far as the content of the notion is concerned, Argentina points out that FET cannot be interpreted to mean that no change in the legal framework may be made if circumstances so require. In the GOA\u2019s Counter-Memorial, it is thus stated that\n\n\"[c]ountries with unstable economies - such as Argentina - did not undertake to refrain from undergoing economic crises again. If El Paso\u2019s interpretation of the standard were allowed, bilateral investment treaties would only be used to worsen the crisis when making the country in trouble compensate the investors affected and thus keep them isolated from the crisis.\"289\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 604; see also Rejoinder, \u00a7 389 and its footnotes.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 631.\n\n***2. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the Legal Standard***\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nThe Tribunal will address in turn the two issues raised by the FET.\n\n*(i) The Relation of Fair and Equitable Treatment with the International* *Minimum Standard*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nAs far as the relation between FET and the minimum standard of international law is concerned, two main approaches have been adopted by ICSID tribunals, to which one may add an intermediate, undecided position.\n\n332.\n\nUnder the first approach, FET has to be equated with the minimum standard of treatment provided for by general international law. This has been, for example, the position adopted by the *CMS* tribunal:\n\n\"In fact, the Treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment and its connection with the required stability and predictability of the business environment, founded on solemn legal and contractual commitments, is *not different from the international law minimum* standard and its evolution under customary law.\"290\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 284. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n333.\n\nThe second approach deals with FET as an autonomous concept, considered in general as more demanding and more protective of investors\u2019 rights than the minimum standard of treatment provided for by general international law. The *Azurix* tribunal, for example, took this position:\n\n\"The clause, as drafted, permits to interpret fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security as *higher standards than required by international law.* The purpose of the third sentence is to set a floor, not a ceiling in order to avoid a possible interpretation of these standards below what is required by international law.\"291\n\nHowever, after this statement of principle, *the Azurix* tribunal contradicted it, or at least emptied it of any significance, when it added that:\n\n\"... the Tribunal does not consider that it is of material significance for its application of the standard of fair and equitable treatment to the facts of the case. As it will be explained below, the minimum requirement to satisfy this standard has evolved and the Tribunal considers that its content is *substantially similar* whether the terms are interpreted in their ordinary meaning, as required by the Vienna Convention, or in accordance with customary international law.\"292\n\n*Azurix, supra* note 50, \u00a7 361. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n*Ibid.* Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n334.\n\nBetween these two approaches, some tribunals chose not to decide. This was the case of the tribunal in *BG v. Argentina* which adopted the following position:\n\n\"For the reasons set out below, this Tribunal has concluded that the measures adopted by Argentina fall below the minimum standard and it is consequently not necessary for this award to examine whether the Argentine-UK BIT provides a more generous independent standard of protection.\"293\n\n*BG Group Pic v. Argentina,* UNCITRAL\u00a0[hereinafter *BG*],,\u00a0Award of 24 December 2007, \u00a7 291.\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal considers this discussion to be somewhat futile, as the scope and content of the minimum standard of international law is as little defined as the BITs\u2019 FET standard, and as the true question is to decide what substantive protection is granted to foreign investors through the FET. The issue is not one of comparing two undefined or weakly defined standards; it is to ascertain the content and define the BIT standard of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n336.\n\nThis being said, it is the view of the Tribunal that the position according to which FET is equivalent to the international minimum standard is more in line with the evolution of investment law and international law294 and with the identical role assigned to FET and to the international minimum standard. The Tribunal wishes to emphasise what is, in its view, the specific role played by both the general international minimum standard and the FET standard as found in BITs. The role of these similar standards is to ensure that the treatment of foreign investments, which are protected by the national treatment and the most-favoured investors\u2019 clauses, do not fall below a certain minimum, in case the two mentioned standards do not live up to that minimum. As stated by Ian Brownlie, \"[s]ince the beginning of the present century, legal doctrine has opposed an \u2018international minimum standard,\u2019 \u2018a moral standard for civilized states,\u2019 to the principle of national treatment.\"295 This has been highlighted already in two arbitral awards. In *Genin,* it was asserted by the tribunal that, under international law, this requirement is generally understood to \"provide a basic and general standard which is detached from the host State\u2019s domestic law.\"296 Then, in *Saluka,* the same idea was elaborated on:\n\n\"... the \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 standard requires the Contracting States to accord to foreign investors treatment which does not fall below a certain minimum, this minimum being in any case detached from any lower minimum standard of treatment that may prevail in the domestic laws of the Contracting States.\"297\n\nAlthough this is not applicable to our case, one may note that in the FTA between the United States and Chile it was held that the fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security standards included in Article 10(4) and Chapter 10 on Investments \"do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights.\" Free Trade Agreement between Chile and the United States of 6 June 2003, Article 10.4(2).\n\nIan Brownlie, *Principles of Public International Law,* 4th ed., Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1990, p. 524.\n\n*Genin, supra* note 128, \u00a7 367.\n\n*Saluka, supra* note 163, \u00a7 295.\n\n337.\n\nIn conclusion, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the FET is not to be viewed with reference to national law - in which case it could be lower than required by international law - but has to be interpreted with reference to international law, the result being that it cannot go below what is required by international law, which is the standard to be applied. But if national law or the treatment accorded to some foreigners exceeds this minimum international standard, it is one of the former that has to be applied. In a sense, it could be said that the foreign investor is entitled to the most favourable treatment, be it national law, rules applied to some foreigners or the international minimum standard embodied in FET. The Tribunal thus considers that the FET of the BIT is the international minimum standard required by international law, regardless of the protection afforded by the national legal orders.\n\n*(ii) The Content and Scope of Fair and Equitable Treatment*\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nThe true problem is in fact to establish the content and scope of the FET. In most BITs the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" is not defined. Pursuant to the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a treaty is to be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\" At the outset, the Tribunal wishes to cite a general comment made by the *ad hoc* Annulment Committee in the *CMS* case,298 with which it cannot but agree fully:\n\n\"The Committee would only note that the fair and equitable standard has been invoked in a great number of cases brought to ICSID arbitration and that there is some variation in the practice of arbitral tribunals in this respect.\"\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, Decision on Annulment, footnote 86.\n\n339.\n\nThe Tribunal can also agree with a general description of the FET given by the Claimant in its Memorial in the following citation, although it cannot approve all aspects of this standard as they are presented later in the same submission, quoted in paragraph 328 of this Award:\n\n\"The contours of fair and equitable treatment have gradually come into focus in the past few years. It has become clear that the basic touchstone of fair and equitable treatment is to be found in the legitimate and reasonable expectations of the parties, which derive from the obligation of good faith.\"299\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 506.\n\n340.\n\nWithin this general acceptable definition, some tribunals have however extended the scope of the FET to a point where, according to this Tribunal, the sovereign power of the State to regulate its economy is negated, as will be developed below.\n\n***3. The Different Conceptions Used by Arbitral Tribunals***\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n341.\n\nOne of the broadest conceptions of FET is that the State has *a duty to adopt a proactive behaviour in favour of the foreign investment.* This has been stated for example in the case of *MTD,* where the tribunal, although referring to *Tecmed,* seems to have even expanded on it, when it said:\n\n\"In terms of the BIT, fair and equitable treatment should be understood to be treatment in an even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment. Its terms are framed as a proactive statement - \u2018to promote,\u2019 \u2018to create,\u2019 \u2018to stimulate\u2019 - rather than prescriptions for a passive behavior of the State or avoidance of prejudicial conduct to the investors.\"300\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. & MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* [hereinafter *MTD],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Award of 25 May 2004, \u00a7 113.\n\n342.\n\nSometimes, the description of what FET implies looks like *a programme of good governance that no State in the world is capable of guaranteeing at all times.* The exigencies of FET have been detailed in *Tecmed* in the following manner:\n\n\"To provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations. Any and all State actions conforming to such criteria should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued, or the resolutions approved thereunder, but also to the goals underlying such regulations. The foreign investor also expects the host State to act consistently, i.e. without arbitrarily revoking any preexisting decisions or permits issued by the state that were relied upon by the investor to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and business activities. The investor also expects the state to use the legal instruments that govern the actions of the investor or the investment in conformity with the function usually assigned to such instruments, and not to deprive the investor of its investment without the required compensation.\"301\n\nTecmed, *supra* note 161, \u00a7 154.\n\n343.\n\nIt is, according to this Tribunal, interesting to note that the *ad hoc* Annulment Committee in the *MTD* case distanced itself from the very broad definition in *Tecmed* on which the *MTD* tribunal had relied. It did so in the following terms:\n\n\"According to the Respondent, \u2018the *TecMed* programme for good governance\u2019 is extreme and does not reflect international law. The *TECMED* dictum is also subject to strenuous criticism from the Respondent\u2019s experts, Mr. Jan Paulsson and Sir Arthur Watts...\n\nThe Committee can appreciate some aspects of these criticisms. For example the *TECMED* Tribunal\u2019s apparent reliance on the foreign investor\u2019s expectations as the source of the host State\u2019s obligations (such as the obligation to compensate for expropriation) is questionable. The obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the applicable investment treaty and not from any set of expectations investors may have or claim to have.\"302\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee goes on to take a closer look at the definition of FET given by the *MTD* tribunal and expresses some concerns about the scope of States\u2019 obligations under that definition:\n\n\"... a standard formulated in the terms of paragraph 113 is defensible. No doubt the extent to which a State is obliged under the fair and equitable treatment standard to be pro-active is open to debate, but that is more a question of application of the standard than it is of formulation. *In any event the emphasis in the Tribunal\u2019s formulation is on \u2018treatment in an even-handed and just manner,\u2019\"303*\n\n*MTD, supra* note 300, Decision on Annulment of 21 March 2007, \u00a7\u00a7 66-67.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 71. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n344.\n\nAnother only slightly less far-reaching conception implies that the State is under *an obligation to stabilise the legal and business framework* in which the foreign investment was made. For example, in the VAT case of *Occidental Exploration and Production Co. v. Ecuador,* the tribunal stated:\n\n\"Although fair and equitable treatment is not defined in the Treaty, the Preamble clearly records the agreement of the parties that such treatment \u2018is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective utilization of economic resources.\u2019 The stability of the legal and business framework is thus an essential element of fair and equitable treatment.\"304\n\nThe Tribunal further stressed this point by saying that \"there is certainly an obligation not to alter the legal and business environment in which the investment has been made.\"305\n\n*Occidental VAT Award, supra* note 118, \u00a7 183.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 185.\n\n345.\n\nThis conception was also followed by ICSID tribunals in some of the already decided Argentinian cases by relying on the Preamble in order to identify the object and purpose of the treaty. The *CMS* tribunal turned to the Preamble of the Argentina-US BIT to clarify the standard of fair and equitable treatment:\n\n\"The Treaty Preamble makes it clear, however, that one principal objective of the protection envisaged is that fair and equitable treatment is desirable \u2018to maintain a stable framework for investments and maximum use of economic resources.\u2019 There can be no doubt, therefore, that a stable legal and business environment is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment.\"306\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 274.\n\n346.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *LG&E* referred to the Preamble of the same BIT to determine the object and purpose of FET, and concluded:\n\n\"In considering the context within which Argentina and the United States included the fair and equitable treatment standard, and its object and purpose, the Tribunal observes in the Preamble of the Treaty that the two countries agreed that \u2018fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective use of economic resources.\u2019... In light of these stated objectives, this Tribunal must conclude that stability of the legal and business framework is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment in this case... \"307\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7 124. It should be mentioned that if a tribunal states that, if FET is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective use of economic resources, this implies that a stable framework is an essential element of FET, it should also be concluded that the maximum effective use of economic resources should be considered an essential element of that standard.\n\n347.\n\nBut there are also much narrower conceptions of FET, which come closer to the *Neer* test.308 Such an approach, which considers that FET is only violated by *wilful bad faith behaviour of the State,* has been used by the tribunal in *Genin:*\n\n\"While the exact content of this standard is not clear, the Tribunal understands it... [as] a *minimum* standard. Acts that would violate this minimum standard would include acts showing a wilful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards, or even subjective bad faith.\"309\n\n*LFH Neer & Pauline Neer (USA) v. United Mexican States,* (1926) IV RIAA 60.\n\n*Genin, supra* note 128, \u00a7 367.\n\n348.\n\nAs can be seen, there is a broad range of conceptions of FET emerging from ICSID case-law. However, the legitimate expectations of the investors have generally been considered central in the definition of FET, whatever its scope. There is an overwhelming trend to consider the touchstone of fair and equitable treatment to be found in the legitimate and reasonable expectations of the Parties, which derive from the obligation of good faith. This has been aptly stated by the tribunal in *Waste Management IT.* \"In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"310 And the tribunal in *Saluka* reiterated the same idea, when stating: \"The standard of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 is therefore closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations which is the dominant element of that standard.\"311\n\n*Waste Management II, supra* note 185, \u00a7 98.\n\n*Saluka, supra* note 163, \u00a7 302.\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal will now present its own understanding of this standard of protection of foreign investors.\n\n***4. The Tribunal\u2019s Understanding of Fair and Equitable Treatment***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n350.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, if the often repeated formula to the effect that \"the stability of the legal and business framework is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment\" were true, legislation could never be changed: the mere enunciation of that proposition shows its irrelevance. Such a standard of behaviour, if strictly applied, is not realistic, nor is it the BITs\u2019 purpose that States guarantee that the economic and legal conditions in which investments take place will remain unaltered *ad infinitum.* Such an outcome based on the holdings of some tribunals has been criticised by Professor Vaughan Lowe, when he analysed some of the cases based on this kind of conception, in the following terms: \"The tenor of the cases suggests that it is now regarded as \u2018unfair\u2019 or \u2018inequitable\u2019 for a state to make material changes in the business environment that prevailed when the investor committed itself to its investment.\"312 The Claimant itself did accept the view that things cannot remain unaltered.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 523 citing Vaughan Lowe, \"Regulation or Expropriation?\", 55 Current Legal Problems (2002), p. 447, atp. 455, Claimant\u2019s Legal Authority No. 116.\n\n351.\n\nIndeed, in its Reply, El Paso stated that:\n\n\"Claimant does not call into question Argentina\u2019s right to change its laws or regulations. It has never been Claimant\u2019s position that the BIT imposes an absolute obligation not to alter the regulatory framework.\"313\n\nadding however that\n\n\"... [i]t is certainly foreseeable that a government will adapt the regulatory framework to the needs of the country. But the complete alteration of the regulatory framework in a manner that does not reasonably protect existing capital investments promoted by the government necessarily frustrates the legitimate expectations of investors.\"314\n\nReply, \u00a7 570.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 572.\n\n352.\n\nIn other words, the Tribunal cannot follow the line of cases in which fair and equitable treatment was viewed as implying the stability of the *legal* and *business framework.* Economic and legal life is by nature evolutionary.\n\n353.\n\nSome of the specific claims of El Paso show that, if pushed to its logical consequences, this conception of FET cannot be tenable. In its Reply, the Claimant asserted the following claims:\n\n\"Claimant seeks compensation for BIT violations resulting from the abrogation and repudiation by Argentina of approximately *12 key rights* that were granted to investors (such as Claimant) under the Electricity Law, the Energy Regulatory Framework, the Hydrocarbon Regulatory Framework, and the Concessions, which include:\n\n- a uniform Spot Price for sales of electricity to the WEM that reflect the economic costs of the system;\n\n- the payment by electricity distributors of a uniform energy price plus transmission costs sufficient to cover the prevailing Spot Price;\n\n- electricity distribution tariffs payable by end users that reflect the full cost of the energy they purchase in the WEM;\n\n- variable costs of production (VCPs) based upon reference prices of fuel that reflect their undistorted market prices;\n\n- natural gas distribution tariffs calculated in Dollars and natural gas distribution tariff adjustments in Dollars;\n\n- market-driven electricity and natural gas wellhead prices;\n\n- capacity payments during 90 hours a week of US$ 10 per megawatt per hour *(i.e.,* US$ 900 per week per MW);\n\n- the right to export crude oil without prior government consent;\n\n- exports of hydrocarbons exempt from any existing or *future* fees, duties, rights or withholdings, and no taxes, whether federal, provincial or municipal, on CAPSA\u2019s production of liquid hydrocarbons;\n\n- the commitment of the GOA to give 12 months\u2019 prior notice before imposing restrictions on crude oil exports. In the event such restrictions are imposed, producers are entitled to receive, in respect of each production unit, a price not lower than that of crude oil in similar conditions;\n\n- the right of hydrocarbon producers to freely sell their production and the right to freely dispose of the percentage of foreign exchange sale proceeds set forth in the relevant contract, bidding or renegotiation document, set at 70%; and\n\n- the right to enter into electricity and hydrocarbon sale contracts with distributors, large users, marketers and refiners, and freely agree contractual terms, including price and currency.\"315\n\nReply, \u00a7 21. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n354.\n\nSuffice it here to take two examples to understand why it is inconceivable that a foreign investor would benefit forever, because there is a BIT, of \"capacity payments during 90 hours a week of US$ 10 per megawatt per hour.\" In the same manner, can it really be seriously contended, as the Claimant does, that the latter benefits from an internationally protected right that variable costs of production (VCPs) would be based upon reference prices for fuel that reflect their undistorted market prices, and that that right was violated because \"Resolution SE 240/2003 excluded from the VPC used to determine the spot market price the cost paid by generators using more expensive liquid fuels\"?316\n\nCPHB, \u00a7 38.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal, for its part, is inclined to accept the overwhelming jurisdictional trend mentioned above, which considers that the concept of fair and equitable treatment must be analysed with due consideration of the legitimate expectations of the Parties, but it will elaborate on the interpretation to be given to such a statement. If legitimate expectations of the foreign investors are to be taken into account at all, it has to be stressed that of course all the elements that the investors would like to rely on in order to maximise their benefits, if they are indeed expectations, cannot be considered legitimate and reasonable. The Tribunal will thus endeavour to specify what it thinks can be viewed as legitimate and reasonable expectations.\n\n*(i) The Linkage of Fair and Equitable Treatment with Objective Legitimate and Reasonable Expectations of Foreign Investors*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n356.\n\nOn the one hand, if this Tribunal indeed agrees that FET can be linked to foreign investors\u2019 legitimate and reasonable expectations, it insists, on the other hand, that these expectations, as well as their violation, have to be examined *objectively.* It must be emphasised that, as aptly stated by the *CMS* Annulment Committee,\n\n\"[a]lthough legitimate expectations might arise by reason of a course of dealing between the investor and the host State, these are not, as such, legal obligations, though they may be relevant to the application of the fair and equitable treatment clause contained in the BIT.\"317\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the notion of \"legitimate expectations\" is an objective concept, that it is the result of a balancing of interests and rights, and that it varies according to the context.\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, Decision on Annulment, \u00a7 89.\n\n*(a) Legitimate Expectations Can Be Breached even in the Absence of Subjective Bad Faith of the State*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nThis means, firstly, that the Tribunal considers that a violation can be found even if there is a mere objective disregard of the rights enjoyed by the investor under the FET standard, and that such a violation does not require subjective bad faith on the part of the State. This approach of the Tribunal has been followed in several earlier arbitral awards.\n\nIn *Loewen,* the tribunal clearly explained this point:\n\n\"Neither State practice, the decisions of international tribunals nor the opinion of commentators support the view that bad faith or malicious intention is an essential element of unfair and inequitable treatment or denial of justice amounting to a breach of international justice. Manifest injustice in the sense of a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends a sense of judicial propriety is enough, even if one applies the interpretation according to its terms.\"318\n\nLikewise, in *CMS,* the t http://italaw.com/alphabetical\\_list.htmribunal said:\n\n\"The Tribunal believes this is an objective requirement unrelated to whether the Respondent has had any deliberate intention or bad faith in adopting the measures in question. Of course, such intention and bad faith can aggravate the situation but are not an essential element of the standard.\"319\n\nThis analysis was also followed in *LG&E,* where the tribunal declared that it was \"not convinced that bad faith or something comparable would ever be necessary to find a violation of fair and equitable treatment.\"320\n\n*The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America* [hereinafter Loewen], (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/3), Award of 26 June 2003, \u00a7 132.\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 280.\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7 129.\n\n*(b) Legitimate Expectations Result from a Confrontation of the Objective Expectations of Investors and the Right of the State to Regulate*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n358.\n\nThis means also, secondly, that legitimate expectations cannot be solely the subjective expectations of the investor, but have to correspond to the objective expectations than can be deduced from the circumstances and with due regard to the rights of the State. In other words, a balance should be established between the legitimate expectation of the foreign investor to make a fair return on its investment and the right of the host State to regulate its economy in the public interest. The *Saluka* tribunal insisted on this necessary equilibrium and concluded:\n\n\"In order to determine whether frustration of the foreign investor\u2019s expectations was justified and reasonable, the host State\u2019s legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into consideration as well.\"321... \"a foreign investor protected by the Treaty may in any case properly expect that the [Government] implements its policies *bona fide* by conduct that is, as far as it affects the investor\u2019s investment, reasonably justifiable by public policies and that such conduct does not violate the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and nondiscrimination.\"322\n\nIn other words, an interpretation of the fair and equitable treatment standard in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT may not exclusively rely on the interests of foreign investors. The Tribunal refers here to the father of the ICSID Convention who had said that:\n\n\"The purpose of the Convention is to promote private foreign investment by improving the investment climate for investors and States alike. The drafters have taken great care to make it a balanced instrument *serving the interests of the host States as well as investors.\"323*\n\n*Saluka, supra* note 163, \u00a7 305.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 307.\n\nAron Broches, \"The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States\", 136 *Collected Courses, Hague Academy of International Law,* (1972-11) at p. 335 and p.,348. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n*(c) Legitimate Expectations Necessarily Vary with the Circumstances*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nMoreover, according to this Tribunal, legitimate expectations necessarily vary with the surrounding circumstances, as stated in *Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania,* where the tribunal explained that:\n\n\"Although in this respect Art. Il(2)(a) mirrors standard clauses in BITs and other international instruments and courts and tribunals have been concerned with violations of fair and equitable treatment standards, the question whether those standards have been violated has to be considered in the light of the circumstances of each case.\"324\n\n*Noble Ventures, supra* note 158, \u00a7 181. See also, *Waste Management II, supra* note 185, \u00a7 99; \"... the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case.\"\n\n360.\n\nIt has thus been recognised that legitimate expectations might differ between an economy in transition such as that of Ukraine and a more developed one. As the tribunal in *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine* pointed out:\n\n\"The Claimant was attracted to the Ukraine because of the possibility of earning a rate of return on its capital in significant excess to the other investment opportunities in more developed economies. The Claimant thus invested in the Ukraine on notice of both the prospects and the potential pitfalls.\"325\n\n*Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine* [hereinafter *Generation Ukraine],* (ICSID case No. ARB/00/9), Award of 16 September 2003, \u00a7 20.37.\n\n361.\n\nIt was also observed by a tribunal that an investor cannot pretend to have legitimate expectations of stability of environmental regulations in a State such as California, where concern for the protection of the environment and of sustainable development are high:\n\n\"Methanex entered a political economy in which it was widely known, if not notorious, that governmental environmental and health protection institutions at the federal and state level, operating under the vigilant eyes of the media, interested corporations, non-governmental organizations and a politically active electorate, continuously monitored the use and impact of chemical compounds and commonly prohibited or restricted the use of some of those compounds for environmental and/or health reasons. Indeed, the very market for MTBE in the United States was the result of precisely this regulatory process. Methanex appreciated that the process of regulation in the United States involved wide participation of industry groups, nongovernmental organizations, academics and other individuals, many of these actors deploying lobbyists. Methanex itself deployed lobbyists. Mr Wright, Methanex\u2019s witness, described himself as the government relations officer of the company... Methanex entered the United States market aware of and actively participating in this process. It did not enter the United States market because of special representations made to It.\"326\n\n*Methanex, supra* note 174, \u00a7 9 of Part IV - Chapter D.\n\n362.\n\nMore recently, the tribunal in *Continental* insisted on the importance of taking account of circumstances when evaluating a violation of FET:\n\n\"... the content of the obligation incumbent upon the host State to treat a foreign investor in a fair and equitable manner, even when applicable \u2018at all times\u2019 as specified in Art. Il(2)(a) of the BIT, varies in part depending on the circumstances in which the standard is invoked: the concept of fairness being inherently related to *keeping justice in variable factual contexts)\".327*\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 255. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n363.\n\nIt is this Tribunal\u2019s view that, if the circumstances change completely, any reasonable investor should expect that the law also would drastically change. It is reasonable to foresee that a small change in circumstances might entail minor changes in the law, while a complete change might entail major changes in the law. This has been underscored by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in *Starrett:*\n\n\"... investors in Iran, like investors in all other countries, have to assume a risk that the country might experience strikes, lock-outs, disturbances, changes of the economic and political system and even revolution. That any of these risks materialized does not necessarily mean that property rights affected by such events can be deemed to have been taken.\"328\n\n*Starrett Housing Corporation v. Islamic Republic of Iran* [hereinafter *Starrett v. Iran],* 4 Iran-U.S. Cl. Trib. Rep. 122, 154 (1983), 156.\n\n364.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal considers that FET is linked to the objective reasonable legitimate expectations of the investors and that these have to be evaluated considering all circumstances. As a consequence, *the legitimate expectations of a foreign investor can only be examined by having due regard to the general proposition that the State should not unreasonably modify the legal framework or modify it in contradiction with a specific commitment not to do so,* as will be shown below.\n\n*(ii) The Definition of Fair and Equitable Treatment*\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) Fair and Equitable Treatment Implies that there Is No Unreasonable or Unjustified Modification of the Legal Framework329*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSee Christoph Schreuer, for whom the FET \"is not absolute and does not amount to a requirement for the host state to freeze its legal system for the investor\u2019s benefit. A general stabilization requirement would go beyond what the investor can legitimately expect. It is clear that a reasonable evolution of the host state\u2019s law is part of the environment with which investors must contend.\" \"Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice\", 6, *Journal of World Investment & Trade,* 357, at 374 (2005).\n\n365.\n\nA preliminary point to be emphasised by the Tribunal is that, despite the standard reference to \"the stability of the legal and business framework,\" this cannot mean that when concluding a BIT a State gives any guaranty to foreigners concerning its economic health and the maintenance of the economic conditions for business prevailing at the time of the investment. This Tribunal shares the views of the tribunal in *Saluka,* which stated that\n\n\"... while it subscribes to the general thrust of these and similar statements [referring to the stability of the business and legal framework], it may be that, if their terms were to be taken too literally, they would impose upon host States obligations which would be inappropriate and unrealistic.\"330\n\n*Saluka, supra* note 163, \u00a7 304.\n\n366.\n\nFirstly, *economic stability* cannot be a legitimate expectation of any economic actor, as stated quite clearly at the beginning of the last century by the Permanent Court of International Justice (PCH), whose *dictum* still rings true today:\n\n\"No enterprise - least of all a commercial or transport enterprise, the success of which is dependent on the fluctuating level of prices and rates - can escape from the changes and hazards resulting from general economic conditions. Some industries may be able to make large profits during a period of general prosperity, or else by taking advantage of a treaty of commerce or of an alteration in customs duties; but they are also exposed to the danger of ruin or extinction if circumstances change.\"331\n\n*Oscar Chinn (United Kingdom v. Belgium)* [hereinafter *Oscar Chinn],* Judgement of 12 December 1934, 1934 P.C.I.J. Rep., Serie A/B, No. 63, p. 88.\n\n367.\n\nSecondly, it is inconceivable that any State would accept that, because it has entered into BITs, it can no longer modify pieces of legislation which might have a negative impact on foreign investors, in order to deal with modified economic conditions and must guarantee absolute *legal stability.*\n\n368.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s understanding, FET cannot be designed to ensure the immutability of the legal order, the economic world and the social universe and play the role assumed by stabilisation clauses specifically granted to foreign investors with whom the State has signed investment agreements. The same approach was followed recently by the ICSID tribunal in *Parkerings:*\n\n\"It is each State\u2019s undeniable right and privilege to exercise its sovereign legislative power. A State has the right to enact, modify or cancel a law at its own discretion. Save for the existence of an agreement, in the form of a stabilisation clause or otherwise, there is nothing objectionable about the amendment brought to the regulatory framework existing at the time an investor made its investment.\"332\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS v. Republic of Lithuania* [hereinafter *Parkerings],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8), Award of 11 September 2007, \u00a7 332.\n\n369.\n\nIt will be noted, that in the two cases mentioned earlier (in \u00a7\u00a7 345-346), the reference to the Preamble said that its object and purpose was to maintain \"a stable framework for investment and maximum effective use of economic resources;\" however, in determining what these purposes implied for the interpretation of FET, the tribunals in these two cases only retained the first purpose, in order to conclude that a stable legal and business environment is an essential element of fair and equitable treatment, without taking into account the goal that any State has to pursue as well, which is to guarantee to its population maximum effective use of its economic resources.\n\n370.\n\nThe idea that the foreign investor is not protected against reasonable changes was also put forward by the tribunal in the Argentinian case *Continental,* where it was stated that \"the fair and equitable standard is aimed at assuring that the normal law-abiding conduct of the business activity by the foreign investor is not hampered without good reasons by the host government and other authorities.\"333\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 254.\n\n371.\n\nThe State has to be able to make the reasonable changes called for by the circumstances and cannot be considered to have accepted a freeze on the evolution of its legal system. This has indeed been acknowledged by the tribunal in *CMS,* but mainly as a general statement of principle with no legal practical consequences on the settlement of the case:\n\n\"It is not a question of whether the legal framework might need to be frozen as it can always evolve and be adapted to changing circumstances, but neither is it a question of whether the framework can be dispensed with altogether when specific commitments to the contrary have been made. The law of foreign investment and its protection has been developed with the specific objective of avoiding such adverse legal effects.\"334\n\nThe same point concerning a State\u2019s regulatory power was made in *Enron,* where the tribunal noted \"that the stabilisation requirement does not mean the freezing of the legal system or the disappearance of the regulatory power of the State.\"335\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 277.\n\n*Enron, supra* note 52, \u00a7 261.\n\n372.\n\nUnder a FET clause, a foreign investor can expect that the rules will not be changed without justification of an economic, social or other nature. Conversely, it is unthinkable that a State could make a general commitment to all foreign investors never to change its legislation whatever the circumstances, and it would be unreasonable for an investor to rely on such a freeze. This point was also made by the tribunal in *Continental:*\n\n\"... it would be unconscionable for a country to promise not to change its legislation as time and needs change, or even more to tie its hands by such a kind of stipulation in case a crisis of any type or origin arose. Such an implication as to stability in the BIT\u2019s Preamble would be contrary to an effective interpretation of the Treaty; reliance on such an implication by a foreign investor would be misplaced and, indeed, unreasonable.\"336\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 258.\n\n373.\n\nIn other words, fair and equitable treatment is a standard entailing reasonableness and proportionality. It ensures basically that the foreign investor is not unjustly treated, with due regard to all surrounding circumstances. FET is a means to guarantee justice to foreign investors.337\n\nThe same idea is expressed in *PSEG Global, Inc., The North American Coal Corporation, and Konya Ingin Electrik Uretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v. Republic of Turkey,* [hereinafter PSEG], (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5), Award of 19 January 2007, \u00a7 239: \"Because the role of fair and equitable treatment changes from case to case, it is sometimes not as precise as would be desirable. Yet, it clearly does allow for justice to be done in the absence of the more traditional breaches of international law standards.\"\n\n374.\n\nThere can be no legitimate expectation for anyone that the legal framework will remain unchanged in the face of an extremely severe economic crisis. No reasonable investor can have such an expectation unless very specific commitments have been made towards it or unless the alteration of the legal framework is total.\n\n*(b) Fair and Equitable Treatment Implies that there Is No Modification of the Legal Framework when Contrary Specific Commitments Have Been Made towards the Investor*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nA reasonable general regulation can be considered a violation of the FET standard if it violates a specific commitment towards the investor. The Tribunal considers that a special commitment by the State towards an investor provides the latter with a certain protection against changes in the legislation, but it needs to discuss more thoroughly the concept of \"specific commitments.\" In the Tribunal\u2019s view, no general definition of what constitutes a specific commitment can be given, as all depends on the circumstances. However, it seems that two types of commitments might be considered \"specific\": those specific as to their addressee and those specific regarding their object and purpose.\n\n376.\n\nFirst, in order to prevent a change in regulations being applied to an investor or certain behaviour of the State, there can indeed exist *specific commitments directly made to the investor -* for example in a contract or in a letter of intent, or even through a specific promise in a person-to-person business meeting -and not simply general statements in treaties or legislation which, because of their nature of general regulations, can evolve. The important aspect of the commitment is not so much that it is legally binding - which usually gives rise to some sort of responsibility if it is violated without a need to refer to FET -but that it contains a specific commitment directly made to the investor, on which the latter has relied.\n\n377.\n\nSecond, a commitment can be considered specific if its *precise object was to give a real guarantee of stability to the investor.* Usually general texts cannot contain such commitments, as there is no guarantee that they will not be modified in due course. However, a reiteration of the same type of commitment in different types of general statements could, considering the circumstances, amount to a specific behaviour of the State, the object and purpose of which is to give the investor a guarantee on which it can justifiably rely.338\n\nThese two aspects seem to have been implicitly taken into account in *Continental, supra* note 150, where the tribunal examined both general legislation and contractual commitments, both capable of giving rise to some expectations, the force of which would depend on the circumstances.\n\n378.\n\nThe tribunal in *Continental* addressed the question of what can be considered a special commitment giving \"reasonable legitimate expectations\" to the foreign investor with care and insight. It insisted on \"the specificity of the undertaking\" that can give rise to reasonable legal expectations, and for that purpose distinguished:339\n\no Political statements which can - \"regrettably but notoriously\" says the tribunal - create no legal expectations;\n\no general legislative statements which \"engender reduced expectations;\"\n\no contractual undertakings by governments which can create more legitimate expectations and \"deserve clearly more scrutiny,\" as \"they generate as a rule legal rights and therefore expectations of compliance.\" But even there, the tribunal says, whether the FET standard has been violated will depend on \"the context, reasons and effect\" of the unilateral modification.\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 261.\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal will follow the same logic for deciding whether El Paso can be considered to have had legitimate expectations that the Regulatory Frameworks for oil and electricity would not be modified during the full course of its investment. It considers that special commitments have to be carefully analysed as a coherent behaviour from the State, the purpose of which was to have the foreign investor expect that it would be protected against overly drastic changes.\n\nF. The Tribunal\u2019s Application of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard to the Facts of the Case\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n380.\n\nBefore the end of the 1990s, the Argentinian economy was mainly State-owned or -controlled: in the Electricity Sector, thermal and hydroelectric generating facilities, transmission lines and the most important electricity distribution utilities were all controlled by State-owned companies; and in the Oil and Gas Sector, approximately 95% of the exploration and production of crude oil and gas were carried out by Yacimientos Petrol\u00edferos Fiscales (YPF), a State-owned company. This scheme was modified at the end of the 1990s, in both sectors, to deregulate the market and to attract foreign investors. The legal framework adopted at the end of the 1990s in both sectors was modified during the Argentinian economic crisis. It is precisely the measures adopted then by Argentina that are impugned by the Claimant as a breach of its right to fair and equitable treatment under the BIT.\n\n***1. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Violation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard by the* *Measures Enacted in the Electricity Sector*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n381.\n\nThe Electricity Sector was reorganised in 1989. In that Sector, as stated in the Request for Arbitration,\n\n\"[g]eneration was reorganized as a competitive market, in which independent generators, such as CAPEX and Costanera, could sell the power that they produce both in the spot market and under bilateral contracts in the term market.\"340\n\nThe Claimant explained that \"[a] competitive market known as the Wholesale Electricity Market (the WEM) was established so that generators could sell the power that they produced.\"341 This did not mean, however, that the Government which, before the structural reforms of the electricity market in the 1990s, owned and operated the generation, transmission and distribution sectors in a vertically integrated organisation, did not keep some important regulatory powers in such a sensitive sector. The existence of these powers is duly acknowledged by El Paso in its Memorial:\n\n\"The structure of the Electricity Regulatory Framework was established through three interrelated agencies. The first agency is the Secretariat of Energy (\"SE\"), a governmental body with authority to issue rules and regulations to implement the Electricity Regulatory Framework. The SE governs the technical and economic dispatch of the WEM. It also sets the Seasonal Prices for the distribution companies based on calculations made by CAMMESA.\n\nSecond, the scheduling and physical dispatch of the generating units and management of the WEM is carried out by CAMMESA, an entity that was intended to be quasi-independent from the Government (although the Energy Secretariat always maintained veto power over CAMMESA) and represents all agents of the WEM.\n\nThird, the Ente Nacional Regulador de la Electricidad (\"ENRE\") was created as an independent governmental body of the GOA with both regulatory and jurisdictional power over the power industry. These last two bodies were created as part of the new regulatory framework.\"342\n\nThe main features of the electricity market established at the end of the 90s were: payments based on Spot Prices based on variable costs of production (VCP, expressed in dollars), favouring the most efficient actors and payments based on freely negotiated contracts denominated in dollars, plus capacity payments in dollars to induce investors to upgrade the system.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00a7 36.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 107.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 118-120.\n\n382.\n\nThe Claimant considers that the changes introduced at the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002 to cope with the crisis transformed the existing system into a completely different one. This amounted to unfair and inequitable treatment of the economic actors in the electricity market:\n\n\"In summary, through several laws, decrees and resolutions, the GOA has severely and unfairly intervened into a competitive market, distorting a previously established set of rules in a manner that interferes with El Paso\u2019s legitimate and reasonable expectations, depriving it of duly acquired rights.\"343\n\nMore specifically, El Paso claims that it had a legitimate expectation that the devaluation would have no effect on the capacity payments:\n\n\"Since the Electricity Regulatory Framework set capacity payments in Dollars, and since such capacity payments were designed to encourage investments and ensure adequate levels of generation capacity availability, investors also had legitimate expectations that *if a devaluation of the Peso occurred, capacity payments would be kept in Dollars at their original value* or, alternatively, adjusted in Pesos proportionally to the devaluation. Since investment costs are essentially and foreseeably incurred in foreign currency, a devaluation of the Peso should not change their Dollar value.\"344\n\nMore generally, El Paso claims that there had been assurances that \"the variables impacting its business were not dependent on changes in the foreign exchange policy.\"345\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 322.\n\n*Ibid.,$* 153. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 157.\n\n383.\n\nThe Respondent insists on the fact that, although deregulated, the electricity market was subject to the State\u2019s regulatory power, as was indeed acknowledged by the Claimant:\n\n\"The generation of electric power is a considerably deregulated activity that is carried out within the context of a regulatory structure that has been modified since the creation of the WEM, while the Executive Branch has not assumed any commitment not to amend such regulations.\"346\n\nAs a result, Argentina contends that El Paso had no \"right not to have the electric power generation system changed or adjusted, and no right not to be subject to the general pesification of the Argentine economy.\"347 According to the GOA, El Paso \"cannot invoke a right not to have WEM regulations changed because that was an intrinsic characteristic of the sector.\"348 To illustrate this statement, it has indicated in its Counter-Memorial that, from their creation to the enactment of the Emergency Law in January 2002, the procedures in the WEM had already been modified many times. According to Argentina:\n\n\"Since the enactment of the Electricity Law in 1991, the Energy Department Secretary issued several resolutions that modified the WEM operation. For instance, the Energy Department modified the available capacity payment in 1992 and the method to calculate the spot price in 1995, among many other amendments. In 2001, before the crisis, the Argentine Executive Branch issued a presidential decree that also introduced significant changes to the sector.\n\n... In late 2001, when the crisis began, the Procedures had already been modified by the Energy Department 131 times.\"349\n\nThis leads the Respondent to the conclusion that \"the legitimate expectations of any investor entering the market had to include the true possibility of changes and amendments to the Procedures.\"350\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 259.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 266.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 270.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 271 and 273.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 276.\n\n*(ii) The Violation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard by the Measures Enacted in the Oil and Gas Sector*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nIn the Oil and Gas Sector, the Claimant explains that, at the end of the 90s, private companies were allowed to conduct operations in new and unexplored areas as well as in those oil fields that had been exploited only by YPF, and could freely own and sell their production, either locally or abroad, due to the abolition of hydrocarbon import/export restrictions and the elimination of duties and withholdings on exports and imports of hydrocarbons guaranteed to them. El Paso complains about some restrictions on exports but mainly about the withholding taxes on exports, relying in particular on Article 3 of Decree 1589/1989 providing that \"[e]xports of hydrocarbons shall be exempt from any existing or future fees, duties, rights or withholdings\" and on Article 403 of Law 12,161 prescribing that \"except for royalties, no other taxes, whether federal, provincial or municipal, shall be imposed on the production of liquid hydrocarbons.\" Moreover, the Claimant considers that its right to dollar-denominated purchase and sale agreements was violated by the mandatory pesification at the artificial and confiscatory exchange rate of US$ 1 = 1 Peso.\n\n385.\n\nThe Respondent, for its part, holds that none of the rights invoked by El Paso existed, and that the oil and gas Framework implied a right of the State to regulate the market in the general public interest. The GOA asserts that there is no right to the non-application of restrictions on oil and gas exports, no right to the non-creation of export duties, and no right for anyone to be excluded from the effects of the *pesification* of the whole Argentine economy.\n\n386.\n\nConcerning the *general regulatory power,* the Government retained, as it did in the Electricity Sector, some regulatory powers: for example, according to Article 6 of Decree 1589/1989, it could impose restrictions on crude oil exports, on twelve-month prior notice. It is also provided in the Hydrocarbons Law of 1967 that the concessionaires shall own the oil and gas they extract and may transport, market, industrialise and trade the related derivatives, \"in compliance with such regulations as the Executive Branch may issue, on reasonable technical-economic bases that consider the needs of the domestic market and seek to encourage oil and gas exploration and exploitation.\"351\n\nHydrocarbons Law, 1967, section 6 \u00a7 1.\n\n387.\n\nAs far as *exports* are concerned, the Respondent explains that,\n\n\"[a]s the primary aim of the oil policy is to supply the Argentine market, oil and gas exports are subject to self-supply, the application of reasonable prices and the Executive Branch\u2019s prior authorization.\"352\n\nIndeed, Section 6 \u00a74.4 of the Hydrocarbons Law provides:\n\n\"The Executive Branch shall allow exporting oil and gas or derivatives not required to satisfy adequately domestic needs, provided that these exports are made at reasonable commercial prices and, in that case, the criteria that shall govern the domestic market operations may be established to allow all producers in the country to participate therein on a rational and equitable basis.\"\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 353.\n\n388.\n\nAs for *withholdings* on exports, Argentina explains that whether one looks at the Mining Code or the Hydrocarbons Law applicable to CAPSA\u2019s concessions, or at the Presidential Decree No. 43/91 of 7 January 1991 granting CAPEX its concession, as well as the different regulatory decrees, there was no vested right to tax stabilisation, the State having explicitly retained its fiscal regulation power towards both companies.\n\n389.\n\nFinally, as far as *pesification* is concerned, the Respondent considers that, on the one hand, the crude oil producers and refiners voluntarily adjusted their contracts to the new context and that, on the other hand, and in any case, the Argentinian companies benefited from the pesification process.\n\n***2. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis: General Approach***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nThe Tribunal does not doubt that\n\n\"[t]he legal rights granted by the Government of Argentina through the Electricity Regulatory Framework, the Hydrocarbons Regulatory Framework and the BIT were very important to El Paso\u2019s decision to invest in Argentina,\"353\n\nbut this does not *ipso facto* grant El Paso a right to have this framework unaltered throughout the years, whatever the economic circumstances. The Claimant does not seem to question the sovereign right of a government to adopt new rules; in its Reply, the Claimant acknowledges that \"[o]f course, the Government can alter its laws and regulations at any time in the public interest,\"354 but adds immediately that \"there are and must be some limits.\"355 And El Paso indeed finds that Argentina\u2019s measures go beyond the limits authorised by the BIT: in its view, the decisions and regulations in issue did not result from a normal exercise of regulatory powers but, in reality, were measures that brought a radical alteration of key rules, effectively eviscerated the existing regulatory frameworks, and therefore exceeded normal regulatory powers. This emerges, for example, from the following passage in its Memorial: \"... the totality of the GOA\u2019s actions has radically changed the regulatory regime so that the electricity generators are forced to suffer the consequences of the Argentine crisis.\"356 But why and on what legal basis should El Paso have been immune from the severe economic crisis faced by Argentina at the end of 2001? The Respondent asserts that it adopted reasonable measures to deal with the serious economic circumstances prevailing at the end of 2001 and insists that, knowing the economic history of Argentina, El Paso could not have had reasonable expectations of guaranteed stability of all the parameters in place when it decided on its investment:\n\n\"When the Claimant invested in the oil and electric power industries in Argentina, it knew that such economy was under development and that it had a long history of growth cycles followed by serious crises. Investing in these types of economies permits to obtain higher profits than in stabler economies, but there are also higher risks. The Claimant was aware of these advantages and risks.\"357\n\nThe Claimant mentions that, in order to promote investments in the Electricity Sector and to explain the Regulatory Framework, the Government had organised road shows, conferences and seminars to explain the main features of the Framework and to give assurance to investors that their rights would be protected.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 201.\n\nReply, \u00a7 4.\n\n*Ibid.,* See also *ibid.,* \u00a7 570: \"Claimant does not call into question Argentina\u2019s right to change its laws or regulations. It has never been Claimant\u2019s position that the BIT imposes an absolute obligation not to alter the regulatory framework.\"\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 324.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 644.\n\n391.\n\nThe Tribunal will try to ascertain what El Paso could reasonably have expected when it decided to invest in Argentina and whether there were any commitments on the part of that State not to change the basic tenets of the Regulatory Frameworks put in place.\n\n392.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1990s, the GOA aggressively targeted foreign investors and conducted several road shows in the United States, Europe and Southeast Asia to promote privatisation; US investors were the focal points of these trips. The Claimant asserts that strong legal value should be attached to such unilateral declarations of Argentina, comparing them to those made by France in the *Nuclear Tests* cases358 between Australia and New Zealand, on the one hand, and France, on the other, where France in her pleadings, had presented unilateral declarations before the World Court and the ICJ had concluded that these declarations created binding obligations for France. It is the Tribunal\u2019s view, however, that what is involved here are two totally different types of unilateral declarations - one made before the highest judicial body in the world, the other in commercial meetings - and that no lesson can be drawn from the *Nuclear Tests* cases to give legal weight to investment-promoting road shows. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, such political and commercial incitements cannot be equated with commitments capable of creating reasonable expectations protected by the international mechanism of the BIT.\n\n*Nuclear Tests* cases *(Australia v. France),* Judgment of 20 December 1974, ICJ Reports 1974, p. 253.\n\n393.\n\nThe Tribunal will next consider the position of the Claimant, which has laid much emphasis on legal or political representations made to foreign investors and attesting to the good intentions of the GOA regarding the stability of its regulations. Statements contained in Argentina\u2019s legislation or made by the President of the Republic as the country\u2019s highest authority were relied on by the Claimant, especially:\n\n- the preamble of Decree No. 1589/1989, which stated that the Decree had been enacted \" to set clear and definitive rules that guarantee the legal stability for the contractual arrangements in the hydrocarbon sector;\"\n\n- the message of Carlos Menem, President of the Republic, made jointly with the Minister of Economy, Domingo Cavallo, delivered at the National Congress on 13 June 1991 regarding the Electricity Regulatory Framework Law. This message asserts that the enactment of the Electricity Law \"give[s] the required legal certainty to the process of transformation of the electricity sector, thus preventing the ancient lack of stability of the rules of the game.\"\n\n394.\n\nThe Tribunal however cannot consider that any rule or even clear commitment embodied in a general piece of legislation or regulation - as in Decree No. 1589/1989 - is in itself a special commitment towards the foreign investors,359 as such a conclusion would again immobilise the legal order and prevent any adaptation to circumstances. These items might only raise reduced expectations which do not guarantee complete stability and have to be analysed in relation to other undertakings and with due regard to all circumstances.\n\n*PSEG, supra* note 337, where the Tribunal said: \"Legitimate expectations by definition require a promise of the administration on which the Claimants rely to assert a right that needs to be observed.\" \u00a7 241.\n\n395.\n\nMoreover, a declaration made by the President of the Republic clearly must be viewed by everyone as a political statement, and this Tribunal is aware, as is every individual, of the limited confidence that can be given to such political statements in all countries of the world. It might well be that these representations contributed to inducing potential investors to invest in the sectors concerned, as many of them - including El Paso - actually did. But it is one thing to be induced by political proposals to make an economic decision, and another thing to be able to rely on these proposals to claim legal guarantees.\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the GOA made a specific commitment to foreign investors not to modify the existing framework, which was designed to attract them. It seems uncontested that the Executive was endowed with broad regulatory powers over the Electricity Sector and the Oil and Gas Sector.\n\n397.\n\nIn the *Electricity Sector,* El Paso complains about the changes introduced in the WEM. The question is whether it had a legitimate expectation that such changes would never occur. The Argentinian Electric Power Sector is regulated by Laws Nos. 15,336 and 24,065 (Electricity Law), as well as by the administrative orders based thereon. According to Sections 35 and 36 of the Electricity Law, the Secretary of the Energy Department is in charge of regulating the WEM.360 The Tribunal notes that Presidential Decree No. 186/95, Section 6, established that \"the agents and participants of the wholesale electric market (WEM) shall operate pursuant to the regulations issued for such purpose by the Energy Department.\"361 As a consequence, it is clear that the Secretary of the Energy Department Secretary could introduce changes in the functioning of the WEM.\n\nSee Law N\u00b0 24,065 (the \"Electricity Law\"), published in the Official Gazette on 16 January 1992. Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 37.\n\nPresidential Decree 186/95 of July 25, 1995, Respondent\u2019s Exhibit RA 43, cited in the Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 267.\n\n398.\n\nIn other words, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the legitimate expectations of any investor entering the energy market had to include the real possibility of reasonable changes and amendments to the procedures governing the WEM.\n\n399.\n\nThe same can be said of the *Oil and Gas Sector.* Section 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law of 1967 provided that concessionaires shall own the oil and gas they extract and may transport, market, industrialise and trade the related derivatives, \"in compliance with such regulations as the Executive Branch may issue, on reasonable technical-economic bases that consider the needs of the domestic market and seek to encourage oil and gas exploration and exploitation.\" In order to meet these objectives, the Government may use any relevant tool: as asserted by the Respondent, \"[t]he self-supply at reasonable prices may therefore be subject to established export quotas, export duties or other instruments that the Government may deem appropriate for the circumstances undergone by the country.\"362\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 368.\n\n400.\n\nIt is therefore also the view of the Tribunal that the legitimate expectations of any investor entering the oil and gas market had to include the real possibility of reasonable changes and amendments in the legal framework, made by the competent authorities within the limits of the powers conferred on them by the law.\n\n401.\n\nAsa general statement, the Tribunal agrees with the Republic of Argentina that\n\n\"[i]solating the foreign investor from the crisis through the ICSID is distorting the nature and purpose of the protection granted by treaties to investors only to turn them into privileged subjects that may appear before such World Bank agency seeking protection against structural crises as the one undergone by the Argentine economy. Bilateral treaties are not good business insurance or a protection against a crisis.363\n\nThe same concern was expressed by Professor Ian Brownlie in his Separate Opinion on the Final Award in *CME Czech Republic B. V. v. Czech Republic,* where he stated:\n\n\"It would be strange indeed, if the outcome of acceptance of a bilateral investment treaty took the form of liabilities \u2018likely to entail catastrophic repercussions for the livelihood and economic well-being of the population\u2019...,\"364\n\nRespondent's Counter Memorial, \u00a7 316. See also, *Maffezini, supra* note 127, \u00a7 *64**;* *Azurix, supra* note 50, \u00a7 291.\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. v. The Czech Republic* [hereinafter *CME],* UNCITRAL, Separate Opinion on Final Award of 14 March 2003, \u00a7 78.\n\n402.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus consider whether any of the measures complained of by El Paso can be considered as adopted outside *the acceptable margin of change* that must be taken into account by any investor and therefore be characterised as unfair and inequitable treatment, before considering the issue of a possible violation of the FET standard by the accumulation of all the measures complained of. The question is therefore whether the measures adopted exceeded the normal regulatory powers of the State and violated the legitimate expectations of the Claimant.\n\n***3. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the Measures Adopted in the Electricity Sector***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) General Remark*\n--------------------\n\n403.\n\nIt has been stated by the Tribunal that the FET standard can be breached if there is a violation of a special commitment.\n\n404.\n\nIt is a fact that El Paso never entered into any concession contract with the GOA embodying a stabilisation clause. There is no contractual relationship whatsoever with the State resulting in rights capable of being invoked by El Paso. There was no particular relationship between El Paso and the GOA before this arbitration, and no special commitment on which El Paso could reasonably rely. The legitimate expectations of any investor entering the electric power generation market of Argentina had therefore to include the possibility of changes in the procedures regulating the WEM. The Tribunal will however, for the sake of completeness, also examine whether there were any specific commitments in the concessions granted to CAPEX and CAPSA, of which El Paso was an indirect shareholder.\n\n*(ii) Presentation of the Wholesale Electricity Market*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nPower generators obtained their revenues from three main sources: (i) sales to the Spot Market at Spot Prices through the WEM; (ii) sales through the WEM to the Term Market by means of power purchase agreements (PPAs) at contractual prices; and (iii) capacity payments.\n\n406.\n\nIn the WEM, the price was determined on an hourly basis, taking into consideration the marginal cost of the least efficient generator who was dispatched at any given hour. It was fixed on an hourly basis, taking into account the (marginal) cost of generating one additional megawatt-hour (MWh) to supply such possible increase in the system\u2019s demand at that time. This price was known as the Spot Price or Market price, which could undergo significant variations from hour to hour.\n\n407.\n\nElectricity distributors may purchase electric power at the Spot Price, but also through a stabilised (or seasonal) price system. With respect to the latter, every quarter, and based on CAMMESA\u2019s estimates, the Energy Department established in advance the seasonal energy price applicable to such period. This was the price at which distribution companies would buy in the Spot Market. The differences between both prices (hourly spot and seasonal prices) were accumulated in a special account called the Stabilisation Fund. This system benefited efficient generators since it enabled them to receive larger gross margins (that is, the difference between the Spot Price and the generator\u2019s actual variable costs of production (VCP)).\n\nPower generators could also enter into PPAs, in which the price was freely determined. Typically, term contracts were concluded for one year and denominated in dollars.\n\n408.\n\nIn addition to the price thus received, generators were entitled to \"capacity payments\" which were designed to encourage investors to expand and upgrade generation facilities. These payments were mainly designed to cover the fixed costs *(i.e.* investments and financing), since the competitive energy Spot Price system basically only remunerated variable *(i.e.* operating) costs. Capacity payments were set in dollars because investment costs would essentially and foreseeably be incurred in foreign currency. Originally, these payments were set at 5 US dollars per megawatt/capacity-compensation hour; later on, they doubled and were set at 10 dollars365 before the impugned measures were taken.\n\nResolution SE N\u00b0 61/1992, Section 2.5.2.1 of 1 May 1994.\n\n409.\n\nOn the basis of the Electricity Law, the electricity market was regulated by the Department of Energy. Article 35 of that Law provided:\n\n\"The Department of Energy shall determine the rules applicable to the DNDC366 for the performance of its duties, which shall guarantee the transparency and fairness of decisions, according to the following principles:\n\n\u2026\n\nb) To dispatch the required demand, based on the acknowledgment of prices of energy and capacity set forth in the following article, to which market players shall expressly commit, in order to be entitled to supply or receive electricity not freely agreed-upon by the parties.\"\n\nArticle 36 of the Law established uniform Spot Prices for electricity generators:\n\n\"The Department of Energy shall issue a resolution containing the economic dispatch rules for energy and capacity transactions included in article 35(b) to be applied by the DNDC. Said rule shall provide that generators be paid such rate in each location of delivery as established by the DNDC for the energy sold by them, which rate shall be the same for every generator and based on the economic cost of the system.\"\n\nThis is the Argentine Load Dispatch, an agency in the form of a corporation \"whose majority shareholding shall be initially held by the Energy Secretariat, and where the various participants in the WEM will be entitled to hold shares.\"\n\n*(iii) Were the Measures Changing the Functioning of the WEM in Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard?*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nThe Claimant considers that the changes introduced at the end of 2001 and at the beginning of 2002 to cope with the crisis transformed the existing deregulated system into a completely different one, amounting to unfair and inequitable treatment of the economic actors in the electricity market.\n\n411.\n\nIt has to be clear that the Claimant does not explicitly seek damages due to the devaluation, *i.e.* the abrogation of the Convertibility Law, but bases its claims on the consequences drawn by the Government from this abrogation in the electricity market: \"The alteration of the rules governing the Spot Market cannot be attributed to the repeal of the Convertibility Law.\"367 However, if the issue is examined closely, it appears to the Tribunal that many of the claims are implicitly based on damage caused by devaluation more than by the regulatory measures.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 241.\n\n412.\n\nFor example, caps on Spot Prices for deficit situations have resulted in damage, not because of the cap which was set in pesos - as it always was - but because the pesos thus earned could no longer be converted into dollars at the market rate but had to be converted at the rate of one to one. The Claimant explains this quite clearly in its Memorial:\n\n\"The Energy Secretariat has also converted into Pesos, at an artificial rate of US$1 = Arg.$l, caps that are to be placed on the Spot Price when deficits occur due to system failures. Depending on the deficit level, the following caps have been imposed on the price of electricity in hours of unsupplied demand: Arg.$l2OMW/h, Arg.$l7OMW/h, Arg.$24OMW/h and Arg.$l5OOMW/h. The Electricity Regulatory Framework set similar values, but in Dollars not Pesos. *As a consequence of the conversion of those Dollar values into Pesos* at an artificial rate of exchange of US$1 = Arg.$l, the energy payments that a power generator can receive in deficit situations have been reduced to 1/3 of their original value and are artificially low.\"368\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 256. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n413.\n\nThe mechanism of setting the Spot Price and the Seasonal Price was also altered, but the Tribunal does not consider that such changes were unfair and inequitable, as the unpaid balances due to the creditors in the electricity market were consolidated and either repaid when the Seasonal Stabilization Fund had funds available or transformed into shares of a new company or bonds payable in energy.\n\n414.\n\nThe Claimant equally complains about the exclusion of machines using liquid fuels instead of natural gas due to the shortage of the latter. But the Tribunal notes that this measure was decided in the second half of 2003. Therefore, it could not affect El Paso\u2019s investment in CAPEX since, a few months before the measure was adopted, the Claimant sold its interest in CAPSA and, consequently, also in CAPEX; and its impact on El Paso\u2019s interest in Costanera would have been minimal as that company was sold a month and a half afterwards. Such a minor change cannot amount to a violation of the FET standard.\n\n415.\n\nMore generally, according to Argentina, the new method for calculating the Spot Price was adopted in order to alleviate the problems raised by the new financial situation resulting from the devaluation:\n\n\"The increase in periodicity, the replacement of the *reference price +* *15%* method for the declaration of each VPC component (and not only the fuel price) and the consideration of the variation in the foreign exchange rate implied higher revenues for generators than the ones that would have been earned with the original mechanism.\"369\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 165.\n\n416.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal cannot see in the measures taken to adapt the WEM to the new economic circumstances anything but direct consequences of the devaluation, which is not impugned as such by the Claimant, or technical adaptations of a sophisticated pricing system that did not fundamentally change its structure and its functioning. Therefore, the measures adapting the functioning of the WEM cannot be characterised, *in isolation,* as a violation of the FET standard.\n\n*(iv) Was the Change in the Amount of Capacity Payment a Violation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard?*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nThe Claimant in fact asserts a right to a 10-dollar capacity payment or its equivalent in pesos, stating that such a right was conferred on it by law,370 and considers therefore that any lower amount would breach the FET standard.\n\nSee expert statement by Carlos Bastos to the effect that \"... the 10 dollar capacity payment is a computation provided by law.\" Hearing Transcript in English, Day 5, p. 1211.\n\n418.\n\nAs to the capacity payments, they were set in dollars in order to cover capital investment costs that were dollar-denominated. Thus, it can be argued that there was a kind of necessary link between the dollar value or a peso value equivalent to the dollar value, so that the foreign investors, having made their equipment investments and paid for them in dollars, could be guaranteed to recoup their investments. The question therefore is whether the change in value was such as to amount to unfair and inequitable treatment.\n\n419.\n\nA first observation that can be made is that, contrary to the Claimant\u2019s contention, the law does not provide for capacity payments to be stated in dollars. A second observation is that if the parameters for deciding the level of the capacity payments were indeed provided by the law, no amount was fixed in it, again contrary to what the Claimant contends, and the parameters of reference left a margin of appreciation which has been used by the administration. As an indication of this necessary flexibility, it is possible to quote a Selling Memorandum emanating from the Ministry of Economy, Public Works and Utilities of the Republic of Argentina for the privatisation of the generator Hidroel\u00e9ctrica Norpatagonica presented by the Claimant in its Exhibits and quoted by the Respondent in its Closing Statement:\n\n\"The Secretary of Energy is responsible for setting the capacity payment. The value of capacity has been set at US$ 5 per MW per hour for the period from November 1, 1992 to April 30, 1994. It has been decided to increase the value of capacity to US$ 10 per MW per hour from April 30, 1994 and it currently is expected that the value will remain at this level over the medium term.\"371\n\nThis language is by no means an indication of an immutable value, written in stone.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Statement during the Hearing on the Merits, p. 33.\n\n420.\n\nThere have been many submissions and exchanges concerning the figure of 10 dollars. The Claimant\u2019s damages expert, LECG, seems to differentiate between what a non-expropriating government could have done and what Argentina has done:\n\n\"LECG admits that the Secretary of Energy not only had the authority to modify the amount of the capacity payment but also that, within the framework of the crisis, a non-expropriatory government would have reduced such amount.\"\n\nIn this respect, LECG stated:\n\n\"The changes in relative prices in the economy following the devaluation of the peso would naturally provide an opportunity for a *non-expropriatory Government* to re-examine the appropriateness of the level of capacity payments.\"372\n\nHaving concluded that a *non-expropriatory government* would have reduced the levels of capacity payments, LECG affirmed that the \"appropriate\" level was, in 2002, a little over USD 5.373 However, there is no evidence showing that this amount is more appropriate than ARS 12 (approximately USD 4). Anyhow, the Claimant\u2019s expert itself confirmed that a capacity payment of USD 5 could not be considered expropriatory. It would thus be difficult to assert that a one-dollar difference would amount to a violation of the FET standard.\n\n*Damages Expert Report of Pablo T. Spiller and Manuel A. Abdala* (hereinafter LECG Report) of 18 August 2004, \u00a7 322, Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 12.

CAPEX,\" cell H79; Hearing Transcript in English, id.,pp. 1644-1646, 1689-1691.\n\n421.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that in the new economic circumstances, a capacity payment equivalent to 4 dollars was not, *in isolation,* a violation of the FET standard.\n\n422.\n\nIn conclusion, none of the measures adopted in the electricity sector is considered by the Tribunal, *per se,* as a violation of the WEM, nor a violation of FET.\n\n***4. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the Measures Adopted in the Oil and Gas Sector***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(i) Presentation of the Overall Regulation of the Hydrocarbon Sector*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nCAPSA is governed by the Mining Code first passed in 1887 and updated by Law No 12,161 enacted in 1935. CAPEX is governed by Law No. 17,319, the Hydrocarbons Law enacted in 1967, which to date governs all hydrocarbon-related activities that are not subject to the Mining Code. These two laws established the general principles and the legal system applicable to the exploration, exploitation, industrialisation, transportation and trading of oil and gas, before the reforms at the end of the 90s and the new measures adopted during the economic crisis. At the end of the 90s, the oil and gas sector was privatised and liberalised, and the monopoly of the State-owned company ended. Private entities were generally allowed to conduct operations in oil fields and could freely own and sell their production, locally or abroad. This reform, effected by the State Reform Law of 28 August 1989, was mainly enacted through what has come to be known as the \"Hydrocarbon Deregulation Decrees,\" *i.e.* Presidential Decrees N\u00b0 1055/1989, 1212/1989 and 1589/1989, published in the Official Gazette on 12 October 1989, 14 November 1989 and 4 January 1990.374 These Decrees allow investors freely to dispose of their hydrocarbons and to export them, within the parameters of Argentina\u2019s legislation. The scope of the rights granted and the extent of the State powers have been hotly disputed between the Parties and will be thoroughly examined by the Tribunal.\n\nPresidential Decrees Nos. 1055/1989, 1212/1989 and 1589/1989 published in the Official Gazette on 12 October 1989, 14 November 1989 and 4 January 1990. Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 46.\n\n*(ii) Was the Restriction of the Right to Export Freely a Violation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard?*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Extent of the Right to Export Freely*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n424.\n\nThe Claimant argued that it had a vested right to dispose freely of its hydrocarbon production, including the right to export freely liquid hydrocarbons. This right has been provided for in three Deregulation Decrees, more precisely in Article 15 of Presidential Decree No. 1055/89, Articles 4 and 9 of Presidential Decree No. 1212/89, and Article 5 of Presidential Decree No. 1589/89.\n\n425.\n\nArgentina, on the other hand, explains that\n\n\"[t]his free availability provided for by the Deregulation Decrees entailed setting aside the policy implemented by the mid-80s according to which the Argentine Government (through YPF) was the only producer enjoying the free availability of crude oil and the other producers were obliged to sell their whole production to the state.\"375\n\nAccording to the GOA, there is no absolute right freely to export hydrocarbons, as such exports are subject to restrictions by the Government in accordance with Article 377 of the Mining Code and Article 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 197.\n\n426.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine successively the possible entitlement of the two Argentinian companies of which El Paso was a shareholder to a vested right of free availability of hydrocarbons.\n\n427.\n\nAs far as CAPSA is concerned, this right of free availability was first stated in Law No. 12,161, incorporated into the Mining Code in 1935 and into the three Deregulation Decrees mentioned above, none of which could be incorporated as contractual rights in the mining concession granted to CAPSA before 1925. This right of free availability appears not to have been considered as unlimited. Section 377 of the Mining Code expressly provides that the Executive Branch may restrict or ban fluid oil and gas exports. Also, section 6 of the Hydrocarbons Law provides that:\n\n\"Permit holders and concessionaires shall be the owners of any hydrocarbons extracted by them and, as a result, they may transport, sell and industrialize them, as well as sell their by-products, in accordance with the regulations enacted by the Executive Branch, based on reasonable technical and economic considerations which shall bear in mind the best interest of the domestic market and attempt to promote the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons.\n\nDuring periods in which the national production of liquid hydrocarbons is not enough to meet domestic needs, the use in the country of all available hydrocarbons of national origin shall be mandatory, except in cases where it is not convenient due to sufficient technical reasons. As a result, the new refineries or extensions shall adapt to the rational use of national oils.\n\nIf during such a period the Executive Branch sets the prices for selling crude oil in the domestic market, such prices shall be equal to those set for the relevant state-owned company, but not lower than the price levels for imported oils of similar characteristics. Where the prices of imported oils significantly increase due to special circumstances, they shall not be taken into consideration when fixing the sales price in the domestic market and, in that case, they may be set on the basis of the actual exploitation costs of the state-owned company, such amortization as may be technically appropriate, and a reasonable interest rate on the updated and depreciated investments made by such state-owned company. If the executive sets the prices for by-products, they shall be consistent with the oil prices calculated on the basis of the above criteria.\n\nThe Executive Branch shall allow the export of hydrocarbons or byproducts which are not required for properly satisfying domestic needs, provided that such exports are carried out at reasonable commercial prices. In such case, it may establish the criteria that shall govern transactions in the domestic market, in order to allow all of the country\u2019s producers to participate in it in a reasonable and equitable manner.\n\nThe natural gas produced may be used, first, to satisfy the needs characteristic of the exploitation of the fields from which it is extracted and of other fields in the area, whether or not they belong to the concessionaire and in pursuance of the provisions of section 31. Any state-owned company providing public gas distribution services shall be given preference in the acquisition, within acceptable terms, of the amounts remaining after the abovementioned use at agreed-upon prices which may ensure a fair return on the relevant investment, bearing in mind the specific characteristics and conditions of the field.\n\nWith the approval of the enforcement authority, the concessionaire may decide on the destination and terms of use of the gas not employed in the manner indicated above.\n\nThe sale and distribution of gaseous hydrocarbons shall be subject to the regulations enacted by the Argentine Executive Branch;\"376\n\nHydrocarbons Law, Respondent\u2019s Exhibit RA 10.\n\n428.\n\nAs far as CAPEX is concerned, the concession of Agua del Caj\u00f3n was granted by Presidential Decree No. 43/91 in January 1991. Regarding free availability, Article 6 of that Decree establishes the following:\n\n\"The concession holder shall have the free availability of hydrocarbons produced in such area, pursuant to the provisions of Articles 6 and 94 of Law No. 177319, Article 15 of Presidential Decree No. 1055/89, and Articles 5 and 6 of Presidential Decree No. 1589/89, *the terms of which are incorporated to this concession.\"377*\n\nPresidential Decree No. 43/91 of 7 January 1991. Respondent\u2019s Exhibit No. 243. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n429.\n\nIn other words, the Hydrocarbons Law and the Deregulation Decrees apply to CAPSA as general legislation and to CAPEX as contractual commitments. Before considering whether this entails a difference in the conclusions to be reached by the Tribunal relating to the claimed violations of El Paso\u2019s rights, the Tribunal considers it necessary to analyse the content of the rules that were incorporated in CAPEX\u2019s concession.\n\nArticle 6 of Law 17,319 of 196 7378 prescribes:\n\n\"Permit holders and concessionaires shall have the ownership of the hydrocarbon which they produce, and consequently, they may transport, market and refine the same and market the products manufactured therefrom, subject to such reglamentation as may be dictated by the Executive Power upon reasonable technical and economic bases, in the benefit of the domestic market and of stimulating the exploration and exploitation of hydrocarbons.\n\n\u2026\n\nThe Executive Branch shall allow exporting oil and gas or derivatives not required to satisfy adequately domestic needs, provided that these exports are made at reasonable commercial prices and, in that case, the criteria that shall govern the domestic market operations may be established to allow all producers in the country to participate therein on a rational and equitable basis.\"\n\nThe objective of satisfying the country\u2019s need for hydrocarbons explains why Article 6 grants free disposal of the oil and gas in Argentina but, on the contrary, calls for an authorisation in case of exportation.\n\nArticle 94 is irrelevant, as it deals with the obligations of State-owned enterprises.\n\n430.\n\nArticle 15 of Presidential Decree No. 1055/89 provides that:\n\n\"Free availability of the hydrocarbons... will be governed by the following rules:\n\na) They may be freely commercialized both in the domestic and foreign market *within the framework of the rules in force\"379*\n\nArticle 6 of Presidential Decree No. 1589/89 states that:\n\n\"... Concerning export restrictions. If the Executive Branch were to establish restrictions on exports of crude oil and by-products, Article 6 of Law N\u00b0 17,319 shall apply, by virtue of which producers, refiners and exporters, shall be entitled to receive per unit of production a value that is not lower than the one of petroleum and by-products of similar condition.\"\n\nThe conclusion to be drawn from a reading of the rules incorporated in the CAPEX concession is that no absolute right of free availability existed but, rather, a right contingent on limitations that could be decided by the Government.\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n431.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that CAPSA - of which El Paso was an indirect shareholder - had a right to the free disposal of its hydrocarbons recognised by law, while CAPEX - of which El Paso was also an indirect shareholder - had a vested right to the free disposal of its hydrocarbons, including the right to export freely, incorporated in its concession agreement, both within the framework of the rules in force. It cannot be denied that the regulatory framework in force included the Argentine Mining Code and the Hydrocarbons Law, which expressly provided for the possibility of limiting or prohibiting hydrocarbon exports to satisfy domestic needs.\n\n*(b) Has the Right to Export Freely Been Violated?*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n432.\n\nWere these rights to free disposal, respectively granted to CAPSA by law and to CAPEX by contract, violated by Argentina\u2019s measures? It is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the rights arising from a concession must be clearly distinguished from the rights flowing from the regulatory framework applicable to a concession.\n\n433.\n\nConcerning CAPSA, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the right to export freely that was granted by law was not unrestricted. As any right, it was subject to reasonable restrictions decided by the Government for reasons of public interest, for example in order to satisfy the domestic market. This was provided for by Article 377 of the Mining Code of 1887, incorporated in Law 12,161 of 1 April 1935, applicable to CAPSA\u2019s concessions:\n\n\"The Executive Branch *may restrict or ban the import or export* of fluid oil and gas when, in urgency cases, this is advisable for public interests reasons, which shall be reported, when appropriate, to Congress.\"380\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n434.\n\nThe Hydrocarbons Law No 17,319 of 30 June 1967 also ensured the power of the Government to regulate the Hydrocarbon Sector in all aspects. Article 2 provides:\n\n\"Activities related to exploration, exploitation, manufacturing, transportation and marketing of hydrocarbons shall be entrusted to State-owned enterprises, and private or mixed enterprises, in accordance with the rulings of this present law and with any relevant r\u00e9glementation that may be dictated by the Executive power.\"\n\nNothing is said in this Article about free disposal, but there is a clear insistence on the fact that all activities entrusted to concessionaires in the field of hydrocarbons will be subject to that Law and to any future executive regulation.\n\nAlong the same line, Article 3 of Law No 17,319 prescribes:\n\n\"The National Executive Power shall establish the national policy of the activities mentioned in the preceding Article 2, in deference to the primordial objective of satisfying the country\u2019s need for hydrocarbons with the output from the country\u2019s natural deposits.\"\n\n435.\n\nAccording to this Tribunal, it is only if the regulations were unreasonable, for example not adapted to the purpose of satisfying the national market, that a violation could be found. The Tribunal, however, does not consider it necessary to examine the issue of the reasonableness of the measures adopted, for reasons that will shortly be explained.\n\n436.\n\nThe question which has to be asked is whether a somewhat different analysis is needed of the right to export freely granted by Argentina to CAPEX in the concession agreement. The answer must be in the negative, as the texts granting powers of regulation to the State were also incorporated in the concession.\n\n437.\n\nIrrespective of whether the right of free disposal was granted by law or incorporated in a contract, the Tribunal does not deem it necessary to examine the question of a possible violation of the FET standard, since the restrictions on crude oil export were effective for less than 60 days.381 More precisely, during the first half of 2002, it was noted that there might be problems to supply the domestic market with hydrocarbons. Therefore, the President of Argentina issued Presidential Decree No. 867/2002 on 23 May 2002 adopting certain measures to regulate the export of oil and gas:\n\n\"It declared the emergency in the oil and gas supply in the whole Argentine territory until 30 September 2002\"382\n\n\"It empowered the Energy Department... to determine the domestic production volume of crude oil and LPG that should be used to supply the domestic market.\"383\n\nMoreover, in June 2002, the Energy Department imposed certain limitations on the export of crude oil to ensure domestic supply.384 Twenty-three days afterwards, these measures became more flexible.385 Less than sixty days after the measures had been taken, on 25 July 2002, they were abrogated.386 The limitations on the exports of crude oil lasted only from 30 May to 31 July 2002.\n\nResolution SE 341/02, 26 July 2002, published in the Official Gazette No. 29,951, 30 July 2002. Respondent\u2019s Exhibit No. 124.\n\nPresidential Decree No. 867/2002 of 23 May 2002, Article 1, published in the Official Gazette No. 29,905, 24 May 2002. Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 87; Respondent\u2019s Exhibit No. 107.\n\n*Ibid.,* Article 3.\n\nResolution SE 140/02 of 30 May 2002, published in the Official Gazette No. 29,912, 3 June 2002. Respondent\u2019s Exhibit No. 111.\n\nResolution SE 166/02 of 31 July 2002, published in the Official Gazette No. 29,928, 26 June 2002. Respondent\u2019s Exhibit No. 116.\n\nResolution SE 341/02, *supra* note 381.\n\n438.\n\nThe Tribunal notes - and this confirms its analysis - that in the recitals of Presidential Decree No. 867/02, in which a state of emergency regarding hydrocarbons supply was declared throughout the Republic of Argentina, the following was stated:\n\n\"This measure does not impair the essence of the right to freely dispose, *i.e.* the right of producers to dispose of the product at freely agreed upon price, in the domestic and foreign market, and in the latter case, in compliance with the provisions of Article 6 of Law No. 17,319.\"\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the short-term restrictions on the right freely to export hydrocarbons cannot amount, *in isolation,* to a violation of the FET standard.\n\n*(iii) Was the Enactment of Export Withholding Taxes a Breach of the* *Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n440.\n\nTo find a violation of the FET standard under this heading, the following conditions should be fulfilled: first, the Tribunal must have jurisdiction over tax matters; second, there must be a violation of a right belonging to the Claimant which could result from a confiscatory law providing for an excessive tax, or a violation of a contractual right to tax exemption on exports, in other words of a tax stabilisation clause if such a clause is found to have been granted to the foreign investor.\n\n441.\n\nThere have been extensive discussions between the Parties on the question of whether or not a stabilisation clause was included in the concession contracts of CAPSA and CAPEX.\n\n442.\n\nAs far as *CAPSA\u2019s concessions* are concerned, two legislative provisions concerning taxes and withholdings were cited by both Parties, Law N\u00b0 12,161 of 1935 integrated into the Mining Code and Article 3 of Decree N\u00b0 1589/1989. First, Article 403 of Law N\u00b0 12,161 establishes that \"[e]xcept for royalties, no other tax, whether federal, provincial or municipal, shall be imposed on the production of liquid hydrocarbons.\" Second, Article 3 of Decree N\u00b0 1589/89, which applies to all hydrocarbons concessions, provides that \"[e]xports and imports of hydrocarbons and by-products are authorised, which shall be exempt from all existing or future duties, rights or withholdings.\"\n\n443.\n\nThe Parties hold diverging views on different aspects of these rules. First, they disagree on the applicability of Article 403 to CAPSA: for Argentina, \"this Section was added to the Argentine Mining Code several years after CAPSA was granted the Concessions;\"387 for the Claimant, \"Article 403 was immediately applicable to the Concession under Argentine law as soon as it was enacted.\"388 The Parties also have different views on the interpretation of Article 403, the Claimant saying that it was all-encompassing and included exports, the Respondent contending that the reference to \"production\" has to be interpreted as relating only to production, thus excluding exports. The Parties further disagree on the consequence of Article 403: for the Claimant, it is a vested right which could not be interfered with, for Argentina it is a right given by law which can be modified by a new legislative enactment. More specifically, the Claimant says that \"[o]nce Article 403 was enacted, it took on the status of a vested right that has express legal recognition under Argentine law, and since it is still in full force and effect,389 it is binding under Argentine law and the BIT.\"390 The Respondent, on the contrary, considers that, \"like any other law within the legal framework, this regulation can be repealed or modified with no responsibility attached.\"391 Moreover, the Parties\u2019 views diverge on the applicability of Article 3 of Decree N\u00b0 1589/1989, taking the same positions as those adopted in relation to Article 403.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 401.\n\nReply, \u00a7 179.\n\nLaw No. 17,319 (\"Hydrocarbons Law\"), 30 June 1967. Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 45 and Respondent\u2019s Exhibit RA 10. Article 8 expressly maintains in full force the provisions of the Mining Code and provides: \"Mining properties of hydrocarbons already in the possession of private enterprises before the date of enforcement of this law shall continue to be governed by the rules whereby they were awarded, without prejudice to the rights of the holders thereof to claim the benefits of this present law, in accordance with the procedure which shall be established by the Executive Power.\"\n\nReply, \u00a7 179.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 402.\n\n444.\n\nThe debate was even more heated over the *CAPEX concession:* that concession was governed by Article 7 of Presidential Decree No. 43/91 and Article 3 of Presidential Decree No. 1589/89. The question discussed was whether the right in question was or was not incorporated into CAPEX\u2019s concession and, thereby, transformed into a contractual right.\n\nArticle 7 of Presidential Decree No. 43/91 granting the concession to CAPEX provides:\n\n*\"The concession holder shall be subject to the general tax laws that may be applicable to it,* and such holders shall not be subject to any provisions that may impose taxes, discriminately or specifically on the person, legal condition or activity of the holders or the property devoted to the execution of the relevant tasks.\"392\n\nEmphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n445.\n\nAccording to Argentina, contrary to what happened with the right to export freely, where legislative and executive rules were incorporated into CAPEX\u2019s concession, there is no incorporation of the right to be exempt of tax withholding granted to the investors by Article 3 of Presidential Decree No. 1589/89, quoted in paragraph 442. On the contrary, according to the Claimant, this right, like the right freely to dispose of hydrocarbons, was incorporated into the concession.\n\n446.\n\nThere were also sophisticated discussions on the hierarchy of the different Argentinian enactments, but the Tribunal does not consider it necessary to summarise them, as this would unduly complicate the Award by considerations which are of no relevance for the outcome of the case.\n\n447.\n\nThere is certainly, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, room for discussion of these divergences between the Parties. However, considering the restrictions on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in relation to tax matters and the Tribunal\u2019s previous conclusion that the tax withholdings did not amount to an indirect expropriation, it is clear that the Tribunal cannot entertain a claim that the establishment of tax withholdings - whether or not in conformity with a right deriving from a law, a decree or a contract - amounts to a violation of the FET standard. It does not, therefore, have to settle the controversy between the Claimant and the Respondent over the extent of the commitment not to raise any new taxes allegedly received by El Paso from Argentina; in particular, it does not need to rule on the interpretation of Article 403 of the Mining Code,393 nor does it have to decide whether, when mentioning the \"exploitation of liquid hydrocarbons mines,\" it also refers to the export of the same. Nor does it need to rule on the incorporation of a general tax exemption into the different concessions.\n\nIt can be recalled that Article 403 of the Mining Code provides that except for royalties \"no other tax, whether federal, provincial or municipal, shall be imposed on the exploitation of liquid hydrocarbons mines.\"\n\n448.\n\nDecisions on these controversies might have been necessary in the absence of Article XII of the BIT. But the violation of a contractual commitment not to impose new taxes, in other words the breach of a fiscal stabilisation clause, could only be discussed, unless the amount of the tax were totally confiscatory, as a violation of the FET standard and not as an expropriation. If considered as a breach of the FET standard, the impugned measures are excluded from the Tribunal\u2019s analysis by virtue of Article XII. It is therefore unnecessary and even outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction to settle the controversy between the Parties over the existence of fiscal stabilisation clauses or over any other issue raised by this claim, such as the possible invocation by El Paso of a fiscal stabilisation clause benefiting not directly El Paso but companies whose shares are indirectly owned by it.\n\n449.\n\nIn sum, even if the enactment of the withholding tax were in violation of the FET standard, either because of its excessively high amount or because of a contractual commitment not to levy such taxes, the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction over such claim.\n\n***5. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the Pesification in Both Sectors***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n450.\n\nAnother claim presented by El Paso results from the compulsory pesification of the contracts entered into by the Argentinian companies. On 3 February 2002, Decree No. 214/2002 provided the \"conversion into PESOS of all obligations to pay money... expressed in dollars\" at one to one.\n\n451.\n\nBefore the crisis, some elements were valued in Argentine pesos and some in dollars, and the system was workable as the peso was pegged to the dollar through a currency board. With the devaluation, a huge imbalance would have been introduced into the economy if the Government had omitted to decide what it did decide, *i.e.* pesification. According to the pesification scheme, despite the devaluation, the existing contracts in dollars had to be transformed into contracts in pesos, at the rate of 1 peso to 1 dollar. What happened was a mandatory de-dollarisation, *i.e.* a pesification of contracts, deposits, debts and utility tariffs. It appears that, from an economic viewpoint, if this had not been done after a devaluation of the peso of more than 300%, the prices of electricity and energy would have increased and been multiplied by three. The question here is whether the pesification of contracts amounted to a violation of the FET standard.\n\n452.\n\nIn fact, CAPEX and CAPSA re-negotiated their contracts but El Paso, as their indirect shareholder, considers that they did not do this freely and that the fact that they were forced by the Government to participate in such re-negotiation amounts to a violation of the FET due to El Paso.\n\n453.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to state at the outset that many contracts were excluded from pesification and that it is important to give a full picture of the contracts affected by pesification.\n\n454.\n\nFirst, the emergency decree which was enacted for the application of the Emergency Law excluded from pesification the agreements for the export of fuel power and associated electric power.394 Generators of electricity, with export agreements, among them Costanera in which El Paso was a stockholder, were favoured by such a measure because, while many of their costs decreased in terms of US dollars, as a result of the devaluation, their revenues remained in dollars. In this regard, El Paso stated, in its Memorial, that Costanera was better able to withstand the impact of the crisis due to its agreements with Brazil to export electricity, under which it received payments for capacity and the sale of electricity in US dollars.395\n\nSee Presidential Decree No. 1491/02 of 16 August 2002, Articles 1-3, published in the Official Gazette, No. 29, 965, 20 August 2002. The Decree had retroactive effect to 6 January 2002. Respondent\u2019s Exhibit No. 127.\n\nMemorial, note 16.\n\n455.\n\nSecond, the pesification of the whole economy did not affect oil and gas exports. In early 2002, the Executive Branch excluded from pesification the export agreements entered into, including oil and gas export agreements.396 Therefore, so far as the Argentinian companies were concerned, the agreements to export CAPSA\u2019s crude oil and CAPEX\u2019s LPG were not pesified. In the same manner, the agreements to transport natural gas for export were not affected by pesification. In April 2002, the President of Argentina excluded such agreements from pesification.397\n\nSee Decree No. 410/2002 of 1 March 2002, Section 1(a), (e) and (g), published in the Official Gazette of 8 March 2002. Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 80. Amended by Presidential Decree No. 704/02 of 30 April 2002, published in the Official Gazette, No. 29,889, 2 May 2002. Respondent\u2019s Exhibit No. 102. See also Decree No. 689/02 of 26 April 2002, published in the Official Gazette, No. 29,889, 2 May 2002. Respondent\u2019s Exhibit No. 100.\n\nSee Presidential Decree No. 689/02, *supra* note 396, section 3.\n\n456.\n\nThe narrow impact of pesification on the Argentinian companies is acknowledged by El Paso. In the Claimant\u2019s Reply, it is stated that:\n\n\"Claimant\u2019s hydrocarbon claim does not relate in any way to the pesification of oil and gas exports, which in any case were not affected by pesification but only by the imposition of export withholdings. Claimant\u2019s claim involves the pesification of CAPSA\u2019s and CAPEX domestic supply agreements and SERVICIOS\u2019 Gas Processing Agreement.\"398\n\nAs far as the pesified contracts are concerned, the Respondent has insisted on the fact that \"the *pesification* of credits and debts in US dollars provided for in the Emergency Law was advantageous for the Argentine Companies.\"399\n\nInterestingly, the same conclusion can be drawn from the report of the Claimant\u2019s expert, LECG, in which the following table can be found:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| (in million USD) | **CAPSA** | **Capex** | **COSTANERA** |\n| *Pesified* credits | 14.3 | 3.1 | - |\n| *Pesified* debts | 48.0 | 15.7 | 58.4 |\n| Benefits of *pesification* | 27.8 | 7.5 | 29.6 |\n| Prejudice of *pesification* | 5.4 | 1.2 | - |\n| **Net Benefit** | **22.4** | **6.3** | **29.6** |\n\nReply \u00a7 258.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 97. Emphasis by the Respondent See also Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 440-446 and 550-563.\n\n457.\n\nBoth the Respondent and the Claimant being in agreement on the fact that the pesification did not damage the Argentinian companies, CAPSA, CAPEX and Costanera, the Tribunal cannot see any basis on which a breach of the FET standard could be asserted in relation to these companies.\n\n458.\n\nIn conclusion, it appears from the file that pesification has not caused any damage to the Argentinian companies of which El Paso was a shareholder and cannot therefore be considered as having created a damage of which the Claimant can complain. The Tribunal thus considers that no claim for violation of the FET standard can be derived from the mandatory pesification of contracts.\n\n***6. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the Cumulative Effect of those Measures***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n459.\n\nThe fact that none of the measures analysed - that were not outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or not excluded from consideration by the Tribunal because they did not result in any significant damage - were regarded, *in isolation,* as violations of the FET standard does not prevent the Tribunal from taking an overall view of the situation and to analyse the consequences of the general behaviour of Argentina. In order to obtain an overall picture, the Tribunal has to revisit the causes of El Paso\u2019s sale of shares. It has already held that the transaction was not an automatic and unavoidable consequence of Argentina\u2019s measures, and this prevented it from finding an expropriation. But this does not mean, of course, that the impugned measures did not play an important role in the sale; and the Tribunal will thus successively assess the overall role of Argentina\u2019s measures in the sale of El Paso\u2019s shares and their overall impact with regard to the FET standard.\n\n*(i) The Overall Role of the Argentinian Measures in the Sale of El Paso\u2019s Shares*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n460.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 positions regarding expropriation have been described in paragraphs 270-271. Argentina has invoked a series of circumstances which, in its view, caused the sale of El Paso shares, to which El Paso has objected. In particular, El Paso has objected to Argentina\u2019s argument that the sale was not a consequence of the GOA\u2019s measures but the result of a decision taken by El Paso\u2019s parent company to concentrate on its \"core business,\" divesting assets not related to that business, in order to increase liquidity.400 Before the Tribunal addresses the Parties diverging views on the causes of the sale of El Paso, it has first to deal with the existence and exact nature of this sale which has been the subject of heated controversies between the Parties.\n\nReply, \u00a7 336.\n\n*(a) The sale by El Paso of its interest in the Argentinian Companies*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n461.\n\nAs previously mentioned *(supra,* \u00a7\u00a7 115-116), El Paso sold the shares in the Argentinian companies in two steps, one in June 2003 and another in October 2003.\n\n462.\n\nThe first transaction occurred in June 2003 and concerned the sale of El Paso\u2019s interests in CAPSA, CAPEX and SERVICIOS. In exchange for the sale of its interest in SERVICIOS, El Paso received a 6.3% interest in GASODUCTO, allegedly worth about Arg. $19.3 million, and US$ 29 million in cash, but had to pay US$ 20 million to exercise the option to purchase SERVICIOS\u2019 lease for the LPG plant ultimately transferred to CAPEX.401 The second transaction occurred in October 2003 and concerned the sale of El Paso\u2019s equity interest in Costanera for a cash price of US$ 4.5 million.402\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 51; LECG Report, *supra* note 373. In the LECG Report of 23 November 2006, Table IX on p. 92, the amounts received or paid by Claimant are different.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n463.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s indirect participating interest in CAPSA was sold under a Share Purchase Agreement dated 23 June 2003 by the Claimant, as Seller, to Wild S.A., as Purchaser.403 By virtue of this Agreement, the Claimant sold 100% of the share capital it owned in EPEC Energy Argentina S.A. (\"EPEC Argentina\"). EPEC Argentina in turn owned 45% of the share capital of CAPSA, the remaining 55% being held by the Purchaser. Since CAPSA owned 60.3% of CAPEX\u2019 share capital, by selling its entire participation in EPEC Argentina, the Claimant sold all of its investments in CAPSA and CAPEX to Wild, for a total price of US$ 24 million (Section 2.1 of the Share Purchase Agreement).\n\nShare Purchase Agreement between El Paso Energy International Company and Wild S.A. dated 23 June 2003, Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 21.\n\n464.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s indirect controlling interest in SERVICIOS was sold under a Share Exchange Agreement made by and between Agua del Caj\u00f3n (Cayman) Company and Capex International Business Company (\"CIBCO\") on 23 June 2003.404 The Agreement in question records in its relevant part the sale by Agua del Caj\u00f3n of its entire participation in SERVICIOS, equal to \"one hundred percent (100%) of the total issued and outstanding quotas of SEP,\" *i.e.* SERVICIOS (Recital A) to CIBCO in exchange for the transfer by CIBCO to Agua del Caj\u00f3n of 38.4% of the total issued and outstanding shares of Triunion Energy Company (\"Triunion) (Section 2.1 of the Share Exchange Agreement). The Agreement provides that, after the Closing, CIBCO would pay an \"Adjustment Amount\" to Agua del Caj\u00f3n to adjust for the difference between the Working Capital of SERVICIOS and the Working Capital of Triunion (Section 2.4 (a) of the Share Exchange Agreement).\n\nShare Exchange Agreement by and between Agua del Caj\u00f3n (Cayman) Company and Capex International Business Company dated 23 June 2003, Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 21\n\n465.\n\nUnder a Termination and Set-Off Agreement dated 23 June 2003 by and between Bank Boston N.A., Servicios El Paso S.r.l., Fleet National Bank, El Paso Corporation and Agua del Caj\u00f3n (Cayman) Company,405 SERVICIOS, as Lessee under a Lease Agreement with Bank Boston, Lessor, covering the lease of the LPG plant operated by SERVICIOS, agreed to pay to Bank Boston an Agreed Purchase Price equal to US$ 11,797,910.85 (Section 1.2 of the Termination and Set-Off Agreement), plus VAT, to exercise the purchase option on the lease for the LPG plant and to terminate the Lease Agreement.406\n\nTermination and Set-Off Agreement between Bank Boston NA Buenos Aires Branch, Servicios El Paso SRL, Fleet National Bank, El Paso Corporation and Agua del Caj\u00f3n Cayman Company dated 23 June 2003, Claimant\u2019s Exihbit No. 21.\n\nAccording to LECG, an amount of US$20 million was ultimately paid.

The Purchase Price for all share participations made subject to the sale was US$ 4,500,000.00 (Section 2.2(b) of the Share Purchase Agreement).\n\nShare Purchase Agreement of 3 October 2003 between KLT Power Inc. and Empresa Nacional de Electricidad S.A., Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 21.\n\n467.\n\nThe respondent State argued that the Claimant had not sufficiently proven the interests it claimed in the Argentinian companies.408 In its Reply, the Claimant submitted arguments and additional evidence in response to Argentina\u2019s contestation.409 This response and the related evidence were amended and integrated by the Claimant in its submissions on 5 December 2006.410\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 49-59.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 314-329\n\nEnclosing Officer\u2019s Certificate dated December 5, 2006, Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 223, and Supplemental Witness Statement of Cristian Bussio, Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 221.\n\n468.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the respondent State emphasised the differences between the Claimant\u2019s description of its participating interests in the Argentinian companies in the original Reply as compared to the amended Reply,411 concluding that \"El Paso failed to adequately prove its participating interest in the companies for which it claims.\"412\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 86-92.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 92.\n\n469.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed and analysed the evidence proffered by the Claimant and the respondent State\u2019s critical arguments, the Tribunal is satisfied that adequate proof has been given by the Claimant evidencing the level of its direct participating interest in the Argentinian companies or, when such interest was held indirectly, the corporate relations with the seller of an interest in the Argentinian companies under each transaction. The analysis has included the Claimant\u2019s corporate relation to EPEC Argentina,413 Agua del Caj\u00f3n and Triunion414 and KLT Power.415 It has not considered GASODUCTO since the sales of El Paso\u2019s shares in 2003 did not involve this Company. These corporate relations at the time of the sales are evidenced by the Officer Certificate filed by the Claimant on 5 December 2006 (Exhibit No. 223).\n\nAs per the Agreement described in \u00a7 646.\n\nAsper the Agreement described in \u00a7\u00a7 647-648.\n\nAs per the Agreement described in \u00a7 649.\n\n470.\n\nAs to Agua del Caj\u00f3n and Triunion, the Officer Certificate shows that Claimant:\n\n(a) owned a 100% participation in Agua del Caj\u00f3n through the intermediary of four 100% owned subsidiaries and that Agua del Caj\u00f3n owned 99.92% of SERVICIOS (Annex A);\n\n(b) owned a 23.2% interest in Triunion through the intermediary of two 100% owned subsidiaries and another 38.4% interest in Triunion through the intermediary of three 100% owned subsidiaries (Annexes B and C).\n\n471.\n\nThe Officer Certificate does not record the corporate relations between the Claimant and EPEC Argentina, on the one side, and KLT Power, on the other. However, the following may be noted in that regard. The Claimant\u2019s 100% ownership of EPEC Argentina is indicated in the Share Purchase Agreement between the Claimant and Wild,416 and is confirmed in documents annexed to such Agreement. It is only logical to assume that the Purchaser had satisfied itself of the 100% ownership by the Claimant of 100% of EPEC Argentina shares since this was the object of its purchase. No further inquiry appears therefore necessary. Ownership of KLT Power was acquired by the Claimant under a Stock Purchase and Sale Agreement made on 2 July 1998 by and between KLT Inc., as Seller, and the Claimant, as Purchaser.417 The Respondent has not challenged the Claimant\u2019s 100% ownership of KLT Power.\n\n*Supra* \u00a7 646, Recital A.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 21 June 2006, Annex D.\n\n472.\n\nAccording to the Claimant and its accounting expert, the result of the various transactions on 23 June 2003, including the value of the 6.3% interest acquired in GASODUCTO, allegedly worth about US$ 19.3 million, was \"a net divestiture price for El Paso of US$ 28.2 million in current dollars.\"418 According to the Respondent, there are doubts regarding the amount of the sale transactions in June 2003. Specifically, GOA has contended that the party that bought 45% of the Claimant\u2019s indirect interest in CAPSA had sold in that month 6.5% of that company\u2019s share for an amount exceeding 400% of the price agreed for the purchase by Wild.419 The level and value of the participating interest acquired in GASODUCTO are uncertain,420 while the amount paid by El Paso as a termination fee in the context of the sale of the interest in SERVICIOS, allegedly equal to US$ 20 million, is not proven.421 Argentina\u2019s contentions will be examined below.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 51; LECG Report, *supra* note 377, \u00a7 176.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 97-98; Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 60-79.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 92.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 94-95.\n\n473.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s doubts regarding the sale price of the participating interest in CAPSA are based on the circumstance that the purchaser had sold to Deutsche Bank, during the same month, 6.5 % of CAPSA\u2019s shares for a price in pesos equivalent to US$ 14.1 million at the then current exchange rate. That price was 400% higher than that of US$ 24 million reported by the Claimant, which should have been US$ 94.4 million.422\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 97-98; Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 60-79.\n\n474.\n\nThe Claimant does not deny the existence of a second transaction between EPEC Argentina and Deutsche Bank nor the price agreed on for the 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares, but contends that the operation was not a sales transaction but one of collateral financing and a contingent loan arrangement.423 The 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares was received by Deutsche Bank as a security in the context of the financing of the purchase price to be paid by Wild of EPEC Argentina, and the price thereof was fixed without any reference to the market value of those shares at the time of the transfer.424 Such financing consisted in (i) a loan to Wild for a US$ 14 million from EPEC Argentina (which, in turn, had received the same amount as a loan from Deutsche Bank), and (ii) a direct loan of US$ 10 million from Deutsche Bank to Wild.425\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 385-396.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 388.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 389.\n\n475.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the repayment of the loan of US$ 14 million was secured by: (i) a put option granted by Wild to Deutsche Bank to transfer to Wild 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares at a price equal to the amount of the loan; (ii) the assignment to Deutsche Bank by EPEC Argentina of its rights against Wild under the loan agreement pursuant to which it had reloaned to Wild the US$ 14 million; (iii) the endorsement to Deutsche Bank of the promissory note evidencing the amount of the EPEC Loan Agreement with Wild; (iv) the assignment by Wild of 55% of CAPSA\u2019s shares to a trust created for the benefit of Deutsche Bank; and (v) a pledge on 51% of CAPSA\u2019s shares for the benefit of Deutsche Bank, to become effective upon notice to CAPSA of the transfer of the 6.5% of its shares to Deutsche Bank.426\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 390-391.\n\n476.\n\nHaving thoroughly analysed the various documents to which the Parties have made reference as evidence in support of their respective positions, the Tribunal is satisfied that the transaction regarding the 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares is in the nature of a financing arrangement to secure to the purchaser Wild a portion of the amount of the purchase price equivalent to US$ 14 million. This conclusion is based on the following reasons.\n\n477.\n\nThe contract by which Wild acquired 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares from EPEC Argentina, dated 23 June 2003, is a contract of sale and rightly was so recorded in a number of documents in the file of these proceedings on which the GOA relies to assert that a sale was the true nature of this transaction. However, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, this contract must not be considered in isolation but as part and parcel of a more complex contractual arrangement consisting of various instruments, including but not limited to the contract in question.\n\n478.\n\nAs a matter of fact, that contract was part of a Trust Agreement dated 23 June 2003 between Wild, the Claimant, Deutsche Bank, EPEC Argentina and First Trust of New York.427 Following the Respondent\u2019s request of 23 March 2007 and the Tribunal\u2019s direction of 26 March 2007, by letter of 9 April 2007, the Claimant filed the exhibits to the Trust Agreement, all dated 23 June 2003.\n\nTrust Agreement of 23 June 2003, between Wild S.A., El Paso Energy, Deutsche Bank S.A., EPEC Energy Argentina S.A. and First Trust of New York [hereinafter Trust Agreement], Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 246.\n\n479.\n\nThe exhibits so filed consist of:\n\n- Exhibit A, *Contrato de Compraventa de Acciones* between EPEC Argentina, as seller, and Wild, as purchaser, relating to the sale of the 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares;\n\n- Exhibit B, Model of *Contrato de Pr\u00e9stamo* between EPEC Argentina and Wild (the \"EPEC Loan Agreement\"), whereby EPEC Argentina loans to Wild an amount equivalent to US$ 14 million to finance the payment of a portion of the purchase price to be paid by Wild under the Share Purchase Agreement relating to the sale by the Claimant of 100% of EPEC Argentina\u2019s shares;\n\n- Exhibit C, Model of *Contrato de Cesi\u00f3n de Derechos y Asunci\u00f3n de Deuda Eventual* between EPEC Argentina, as assignee, Wild, as Assigned Debtor, First Trust New York as Assignor, and Deutsche Bank.\n\n480.\n\nThe content of these various agreements is consistent with the Claimant\u2019s description of the various guarantees provided to Deutsche Bank for the repayment by Wild of the loan of US$ 14 million.428\n\n*See supra,* \u00a7 655.\n\n481.\n\nWere the transaction relating to 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares just a sale between EPEC Argentina and Deutsche Bank, there would be no reasonable explanation why: (i) all the contractual instruments described above were concluded on the same day as the Share Purchase Agreement between EPEC Argentina and Wild, 23 June 2003; (ii) in addition to the sale of 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares, Deutsche Bank had to be guaranteed by a number of securities of different nature and extent; (iii) the amount for the exercise of the put option granted to Deutsche Bank under the Trust Agreement was the same as the amount paid by Deutsche Bank for 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares, *i.e.* US$ 14 million, thus protecting Deutsche Bank from any risk that at the time of exercise of the put option the value of the 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares would be lower than US$ 14 million while permitting Deutsche Bank to retain said shares should their value increase in the meantime above US$ 14 million;429 (iv) clauses 1.1. and 1.3 of the Contrato de Compraventa de Acciones430 provide for a condition *('condici\u00f3n resolutoria\u2019)* by virtue of which this contract would become null and void if Wild did not pay to the Claimant, by a fixed date, the price for the purchase of 100% of EPEC Argentina\u2019s shares; (v) the 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares sold to Wild were not delivered to the latter but were transferred to First Trust of New York as *\"Fiduciario,* \"431 subject to the *\"condici\u00f3n resolutoria\"* mentioned under (iv) above.\n\nFor example, as a result of a sharp increase of crude oil prices in the international market.\n\nExhibit A to Trust Agreement, *supra* \u00a7 660, \u00a7 19.\n\n*Ibid..* Recital III; Contrato de Compraventa de Acciones, Article 1.4.\n\n482.\n\nThe foregoing analysis leads the Tribunal to conclude that:\n\n(a) the transaction between EPEC Argentina and Wild under the Contrato de Compraventa de Acciones was a sales transaction covering 6.5% of CAPSA\u2019s shares, subject to a reversionary right in favour of EPEC Argentina of such shares upon occurrence of the condition subsequently provided therein;\n\n(b) when viewed not in isolation but as part and parcel of a more complex scheme under the Trust Agreement and all its exhibits, the transaction reveals its true nature as a loan arrangement to secure the financing to Wild of a portion of the purchase price, equal to US$ 14 million, that Wild had to pay to the Claimant for the purchase of 100% of EPEC Argentina\u2019s shares.\n\n483.\n\nThe respondent State has cast doubt on the percentage of equity interest acquired by El Paso as a result of the transaction regarding SERVICIOS and the value of such interest.432 For the Claimant\u2019s expert, LECG, the percentage amounts to 6.3% and is worth about US$ 19.3 million according to GASODUCTO financial statements of June 2003.433\n\nSee *supra,* \u00a7 653.\n\nLECG Report, *supra* note 373, \u00a7 176.\n\n484.\n\nAs to the percentage interest acquired in GASODUCTO as a result of the Share Exchange Agreement, the following may be noted. Under that Agreement CIBCO transferred to Agua del Caj\u00f3n (a 100% subsidiary of the Claimant) 38.4% of Triunion\u2019s shares, the latter owning indirectly 21.8% of GASODUCTO\u2019s shares.434 Accordingly, the percentage interest should be 8.4%, as contended by the respondent State, not 6.3%, as indicated by the Claimant. Following the Tribunal\u2019s request for clarifications, by letter dated 1 June 2010, Claimant has documented that the interest actually acquired is equal to 6.1%, considering that a portion of the 8.4% interest, equal to 2.3%, was already (indirectly) owned by Claimant through its indirect holding in Capex.435 Having reviewed Claimant\u2019s position and the evidence to which it refers, the Tribunal is satisfied that the percentage acquired in GASODUCTO is equal to 6.1%.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 322-326 and footnote 550; Officer\u2019s Certificate, *supra* note 410; see also CIBCO\u2019s Financial Statements 2003, p. 31.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 1 June 2010, point 1, pp. 1-3.\n\n485.\n\nAs to the value of the participation so acquired in GASODUCTO, the Claimant confirms in its letter of 1 June 2010 that the book value of the 6.1% interest transferred to El Paso, based on GASODUCTO\u2019s and Gasoducto del Pac\u00edfico (Argentina) S.A.\u2019s 30 June 2003 financial statements, is equal to US$ 19,271,152. Having reviewed the said financial statements,436 the Tribunal accepts that the value of GASODUCTO\u2019s shares acquired indirectly by the Claimant, equal to 6.1%, is equal to US$ 19,271,152.\n\nGASODUCTO\u2019s and Gasoducto del Pacifico (Argentina) S.A.\u2019s 30 June 2003 unaudited financial statements have been annexed by Claimant as Annex 1 to its letter of 1 June 2010.\n\n486.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that it paid US$ 20 million for the termination of the lease agreement for the LPG plant operated by SERVICIOS.437 According to the GOA, this amount is not proven.438\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 51; LECG Report, *supra* note 373.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 94-95.\n\n487.\n\nUnder the Termination and Set-Off Agreement, the price to be paid for the purchase option was US$ 11,797,910.85,439 to which the value-added-tax for ARS 6.9 million must be added.440 After converting the amount in ARS into US dollars at the rate of ARS 2.79 for one US dollar prevailing in June 2003, the total is equal to US$ 14,271,029. As indicated in the Claimant\u2019s letter of 1 June 2010, under the Compensation Agreement of 23 June 2003 between Fleet National Bank and the Claimant, the latter had to pay to Fleet National Bank the amount of US$ 5,619,531.22 in connection with the purchase option.441 The aggregate price paid by the Claimant for the termination of SERVICIOS\u2019 Lease Agreement amounts therefore to US$ 19,895,003.35.442 This amount is accepted by the Tribunal based on the available evidence.\n\n*Supra,* \u00a7 602, Section 1.2.\n\n*Ibid.,* Section 2.2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 220, Section 1.1.\n\nAs indicated in the Reply, \u00a7 309.\n\n*(b) The Arg\u00e9ntinian measures were the prevailing reason of the sale*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nThe Tribunal shall address the Parties\u2019 diverging views regarding the causes of El Paso\u2019s sales in 2003 by focusing on two issues which are at the root of the debate, namely, El Paso\u2019s liquidity problems since late 2001443 and that company\u2019s \"core business\" at the time of the sales, since, as alleged by the Respondent and denied by the Claimant, to face its liquidity problems El Paso was led into divesting its \"non-core\" assets.444 The Tribunal has already decided that the measures were not the unique cause of El Paso\u2019s sale entailing a finding of expropriation; it has now to deal with the Respondent\u2019s view that the Argentinian measures did not contribute at all to the decision to sell El Paso\u2019s Argentinian assets.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 82-85.\n\nReply, \u00a7 334.\n\n489.\n\nThe existence of liquidity problems since late 2001 is not denied by El Paso. The 2002 Report filed with the US Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) by El Paso Corporation on 31 March 2003 mentions that:\n\n\"In response to industry events, the credit ratings agencies, including Moody\u2019s and Standard and Poor\u2019s, re-evaluated the ratings of companies involved in energy trading activities. As a result, the ratings of many of the largest participants in the energy trading industry, *including us,* were downgraded to below investment grade.\"445\n\nThe downgrading of El Paso Corporation\u2019s credit ratings had a significant impact on that company\u2019s liquidity.\n\n2002 El Paso Report filed with the SEC, *supra* note 224, p. 33. Respondent\u2019s Exhibit RA 79. Emphasis added by the Tribunal. See also Counter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 26, 63.\n\n490.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, in order to meet its liquidity problems, an orderly disposition of certain assets was planned in a time-frame of three to five years but that \"the Argentine assets of El Paso were not sold either because they were considered non-core assets or to increase El Paso\u2019s Corporation\u2019s liquidity.\"446 The Tribunal shares this position for the following reasons.\n\nReply, \u00a7 337 (relying on Baker\u2019s Witness Statement, \u00a7\u00a7 9, 22).\n\n491.\n\nFirst, El Paso\u2019s 2002 Report filed with the SEC indicates that several steps had been taken since the last quarter of 2001 \"to address the issues affecting us\" and that significant progress had been made \"to meet the demands on our liquidity and to strengthen our capital structure.\"447 The Report lists nine different steps taken for that purpose, among which only one refers to the divestiture of assets, in terms that suggest the orderly disposition of such assets.448 The 2003 Report filed by El Paso with the SEC enumerates the resources available to El Paso Corporation to increase its liquidity, in addition to the sale of assets (which was therefore only one of the various resources available):\n\n\"We rely on cash generated from our internal operations as our primary source of liquidity, as well as available credit facilities, project and bank financing... and the issuance of long-term debt, preferred securities and equity securities.\"449\n\nIt is on record that a large number of assets were divested by El Paso Corporation in 2002-2004, although the divestiture of individual assets apparently did not entail the level of losses experienced by the sale of El Paso\u2019s investment in Argentina.450\n\n2002 El Paso Report filed with the SEC, *supra* note 224, p. 33.\n\n\"The establishment of an exit strategy for our trading business, including the planned orderly liquidation of our existing trading portfolio\" *(id.,* pp. 33-34).\n\n2003 El Paso Report filed with the SEC, *supra* note 219, p. 38.\n\nSee the list in \u00a7 276 *supra.*\n\n492.\n\nSecond, the contribution of the sales of its Argentinian assets by El Paso was so marginal (US$ 33 million) as to make it unlikely that the decision to sell in Argentina was motivated by the liquidity problems of El Paso\u2019s parent company. As mentioned by the Claimant, had the liquidity problems been the cause of the divestiture of such assets, El Paso Corporation would have chosen to divest its investments in the power sector in Brazil, worth approximately US$ 2 billion in 2003 (which investments were kept).451\n\nReply, \u00a7 339.\n\n493.\n\nThird, it is not correct that, as asserted by the Respondent, only non-core business assets were divested in Argentina to meet liquidity problems, while core-business assets were kept.452 Evidence before the Tribunal shows that core-business assets were also sold by El Paso in July and October 2003. This issue is analysed below based on evidence showing what the core business of El Paso was immediately before the sales of its Argentinian assets.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 82: \"In late 2001, El Paso decided to focus on its core business (natural gas production and transportation) and to sell *quickly* all the assets not related thereto so as to reduce its debt significantly.\" Emphasis by the Respondent. The Respondent relies on two documents to assert that natural gas production and transportation was El Paso\u2019s core business in late 2001. The first document (EDGARonline, El Paso Corp., Filing Date, 30 September 2004, Respondent\u2019s Exhibit RA 231) mentions that in late 2001 El Paso\u2019s focus changed by, *i.e.,* \"returning to our core natural gas business,\" which does not mean that natural gas was the only core business. The other (an article by Kenneth Betz dated 25 June 2002, Respondent\u2019s Exhibit RA 115) does not deal at all with El Paso\u2019s core business.\n\n494.\n\nBy a News Release of 5 February 2003, El Paso announced its 2003 business plan based upon five key principles:\n\n\"- Preserve and enhance the value of the company\u2019s core business\n\n- Exit non-core business quickly, but prudently\n\n- Strengthen and simplify the balance sheet while maximizing liquidity\n\n- Aggressively pursue additional cost reductions\n\n- Continue to work diligently to resolve litigation and regulatory matters\n\nEl Paso is committed to:\n\n- Preserving and enhancing the value of its core business - natural gas pipelines, production, midstream and non-merchant power. The company will continue to invest efficiently in these businesses to maintain its leadership positions. The company\u2019s capital expenditure plan reflects that commitment with 87 percent of 2003 capital devoted to the pipeline and production businesses.\n\n- Exiting non-core business quickly, but prudently..,\"453\n\nPress Release, El Paso Corporation, *El Paso Corporation Announces 2003 Operational and Financial Plan, 5* February 2003, Respondent\u2019s Exhibit RA 256, p. 1.\n\n495.\n\nIn its 2002 Report filed with the SEC on 31 March 2003, El Paso, after confirming the above plan, states:\n\n\"We will also continue to focus on winding down our non-core business including energy trading and petroleum markets as well as other capital intensive businesses such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) operations.454\n\nThe Report states that the divestiture plan focused on \"those businesses and operations that were not core to our long-term objectives or *that were not performing consistently with the expectations we had for them at the time we made the investment,\"455*\n\nThe Report then indicates the four primary business segments into which El Paso operations are divided: \"Pipelines,\" \"Production,\" \"Field Services\" and \"Merchant Energy,\" which were all considered to be \"strategic business units that provide a variety of energy products and services.\"\n\n2002 El Paso Report filed with the SEC, *supra* note 224, p. 2.\n\nQuoted in Counter-Memorial, footnote 89. Emphasis by the Respondent.\n\n496.\n\nThe \"Production\" segment is described by the Report as covering \"our natural gas and oil exploration and production activities.\"456 The \"Merchant Energy\" segment consisted in 2002 of three primary divisions: \"global power,\" \"petroleum\" and \"energy trading.\"457 The \"global power division included ownership and operation of domestic and international power generation facilities,\" the commercial focus being \"to develop projects in which new longterm power purchase agreements allow for an acceptable return on capital.\"458 CAPEX/CAPSA was included in the \"global power\" division, as shown by the list of power plant projects existing as at 31 December 2002.459 The Report mentions that \"as part of our 2003 Operational and Financial Plan, we have announced the planned sales of some of these power generation assets.\"460 \"Petroleum,\" as one of the divisions of the \"Merchant Energy\" segment, presumably covered areas other than those included in the \"Production\" segment.\n\n2002 El Paso Report filed with the SEC, *supra* note 224, p. 2.\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 3; See also Rejoinder, \u00a7 31.\n\n2002 El Paso Report filed with the SEC, *supra* note 224, p. 18.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*,p. 18.\n\n497.\n\nIn the 2003 Report filed with the SEC on 30 September 2004,461 El Paso\u2019s purpose is described as follows:\n\n\"Over this two-year period [2002-2003] we refocused on our natural gas assets and divested or otherwise sold our interest in a significant number of assets,\"462 indicating the sales of CAPSA/CAPEX and COSTANERA in the Section \u2018Divestitures,\u2019 under the \u2018Merchant Energy\u2019 segment463 as part of the \u2018global power\u2019 division.\"\n\n2003 El Paso Report filed with the SEC, *supra* note 219.\n\n*Ibid.*, p. 2.\n\n*Ibid.,y.* 122.\n\n498.\n\nEl Paso\u2019s \"Long Range Plan\" was announced after the sale of El Paso\u2019s Argentinian assets had been completed,464 following the change in the Corporation\u2019s management. This Plan\u2019s objective was to turn El Paso into \"a strong natural gas provider.\"\n\nPress Release, El Paso Corporation, *El Paso Corporation Announces Long-Range Plan,* 15 December 2003. Respondent\u2019s RA264.\n\n499.\n\nThe above analysis makes it possible to conclude that El Paso\u2019s core business prior to the sales in 2003 comprised natural gas and oil exploration and production activities (the \"Production\" segment), while the non-core business during the same period included power generation facilities, petroleum markets, energy trading and LNG.\n\n500.\n\nConfronting El Paso\u2019s sales of 2003 with the above-defined core- and non-core businesses of El Paso, it may be concluded that:\n\n(a) the sale of CAPSA, a company mainly engaged in oil exploration and production, was not consistent with the idea of focusing on the core business;\n\n(b) the sale of CAPEX was also not consistent with the idea of focusing on the core business, to the extent to which that company was engaged, in addition to electric power generation, in natural gas production. Since CAPSA owned a 60.36% interest in CAPEX, the sale by El Paso of the former\u2019s shares entailed the sale of its indirect participation in the latter; however, had CAPSA been profitable in 2003, it would have been kept by El Paso in view of its core-business activity, even if this had meant keeping the electric power generation activity of CAPEX (a non-core business but on the same assumption a profitable one), as was done in Brazil;\n\n(c) the sale of SERVICIOS (a company engaged in LNG production and sale) was consistent with the programme of exiting non-core business;\n\n(d) the sale of Costanera, a company engaged in the generation and sale of electricity, was consistent with the plan of divesting power generation projects that did not meet expectations;\n\n(e) keeping PACIFICO (a company engaged in natural gas transportation) and even increasing indirect shareholding in this company on the occasion of the sale of June 2003 was consistent with the programme of preserving and enhancing the value of core business.\n\n501.\n\nWhile the sale of Costanera and SERVICIOS was thus in line with the objective of exiting non-core business, the sale of CAPSA/CAPEX was not. It is therefore to be assumed that such sale was due to other reasons. One such reason can only have been the perceived lack of prospects of recovery from the loss of value suffered by the two companies in 2002 and until the date of their sale. PACIFICO was not sold since it was part of the core business and, not having been economically prejudiced by the GOA measures, was performing consistently with expectations.\n\n502.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the 2003 Report filed with the SEC, El Paso defines the year ending on 31 December 2003 as \"a year of significant change in our business strategy and our financial conditions.\"465 The Report continues by stating that in 2003 :\n\n\"We completed the sale of a number of assets and investments including production properties... Total proceeds from these sales were approximately $3.3 billion;\n\na. We completed a number of financial transactions that allowed us to maintain our access to needed capital to meet our cash requirements, simplify our capital structure, and eliminate a significant amount of off-balance sheet obligations and preferred securities;\n\nb. We implemented a cost reduction program... ;\n\nc. We completed the Western Energy Settlement which became effective in June 2004, resolving a substantial uncertainty arising from the California energy crisis in 2001; and\n\nd. We announced our Long-Range Plan that, among other things, defines our core business, establishes a timeline for debt reductions, sets a timetable for existing non-core business and assets and sets financial goals for the company.\"466\n\nThis confirms that the sale of assets was just one of various measures taken by El Paso Corporation to meet the problems that had emerged in the preceding period, including the liquidity issues. It is doubtful that the sale of the Argentinian assets, due to the modest price, was intended to contribute to the solution of these problems.\n\n2003 El Paso Report filed with the SEC, *supra* note 219, p. 36.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n503.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the Respondent\u2019s contention that \"[i]t was the Claimant\u2019s decision to sell its assets in the country in the worst time of the Argentine crisis, in the need for facing its own global crisis, what caused the damage alleged by El Paso.\"467 It has been mentioned that El Paso Corporation\u2019s policy was based on the orderly disposition of assets. With specific reference to the Argentinian assets, it is on record that El Paso had received an offer to buy part of those assets (the 45% indirect interest in CAPSA/CAPEX) as early as in November 2002, at a price equal to US$ 24 million.468 El Paso\u2019s reply of 21 November 2002 was non-binding and made subject to conditions,469 which shows that El Paso was not under pressure to sell. The Tribunal shares the Claimant\u2019s view that the fact that the sales were made later in 2003, one and a half years after the measures were adopted, is indicative of a prudent decision,470 aimed at mitigating future damage in the presence of a scenario which, at that time, was far from being predictable.471\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 788.\n\nLetters from Enrique G\u00f4tz to EPEC Energy Argentina dated 14 and 28 November 2002, Annex G to Claimant\u2019s 21 June 2006 filing.\n\nResponse letters from El Paso dated 21 November and 6 December 2002, Annex G to Claimant\u2019s 21 June 2006 filing.\n\nReply, \u00a7 374.\n\nAs shown by the continuing validity of the GOA measures and the adoption of further measures (including the increase of the withholding tax up to 45%).\n\n504.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the further contention by the Respondent that there is no official document from which it may be inferred that the sale by El Paso was due to the GOA\u2019s measures.472 The Respondent points to the Reports filed with the SEC by El Paso Corporation for the years 2002 and 2003, which state that the cause of the losses suffered as a result of the sale of its assets in Argentina was the economic crisis, with no mention of the GOA measures.473 By contrast, concerning the sale of the power generation investments in Australia, the 2003 Report states that the losses were due to regulatory difficulties.474\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 26.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 18.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 20.\n\n505.\n\nRegarding the above contention, it may be noted that the SEC filings by El Paso, although important,475 do not exhaust the range of circumstances that may be taken into account by the Tribunal to form its judgment. It has been shown that, contrary to the Respondent\u2019s assumptions, the sale of the Argentinian assets was neither made to assist in improving El Paso\u2019s liquidity and solving other problems; nor did it involve non-core business only. The decision was made at a time when, according to the Claimant\u2019s evaluation, the financial conditions of the Argentinian companies (except for PACIFICO) had deteriorated to the extent of a loss of value of about 90% and when \"the prospects for the near and mid-term future appeared bleak.\"476\n\nIt may be noted that the 2002 Report covers the year preceding the sales of El Paso assets in Argentina, so that its relevance is doubtful. The page of the 2003 Report quoted by the Respondent (Rejoinder, footnotes 31 and 32) contains a chart allegedly recording \"our impairment charges and gains and losses on sales of equity investments during 2003, 2002 and 2001,\" where CAPSA/CAPEX are shown as having been sold in 2002 (at a loss of $262 million) due to \"weak economic conditions in Argentina.\" The reference to a sale of CAPSA/CAPEX in 2002 shows a lack of accuracy in the Report.\n\nReply, \u00a7 369.\n\n506.\n\nIn conducting its evaluation, the Tribunal has also considered that other energy and utilities companies have divested their investments in Argentina following the enactment of the Respondent\u2019s measures,477 losing approximately 90% of their investment according to the Claimant, although others did not divest their investments while faced with the same economic measures.\n\nA list of these companies is contained in the Chart contained in the Memorial, \u00a7 618; see also Reply, \u00a7 363.\n\n507.\n\nIn the light of the preceding analysis and after due consideration of the Parties\u2019 arguments and the evidence in the file, the Tribunal concludes that the GOA measures were, if not the only, certainly the prevailing reason for El Paso\u2019s sales in 2003. It remains to determine the consequences to be drawn from that conclusion. This point will be addressed hereafter.\n\n508.\n\nThe Claimant has asserted that since the GOA measures \"forced\" it to sell, this was evidence of discriminatory and arbitrary treatment of its investment, in breach of Article Il(2)(b) of the BIT which protects the investor if the effect of this kind of measures is to \"impair... the disposal of investments.\"478 The Tribunal has already decided that the GOA measures do not amount to discriminatory or arbitrary treatment of El Paso\u2019s investment.479 No discrimination or arbitrariness having been found in the measures taken by the Respondent, no breach of the above-mentioned provision of the BIT can derive from the sales made by El Paso, even if they were in part caused by these measures.\n\nReply, \u00a7 380. Emphasis by the Claimant.\n\nSee *supra,* \u00a7\u00a7 315 and 325, respectively.\n\n509.\n\nNow that it has been found that Argentina\u2019s measures can be considered a contributory cause of the losses suffered by El Paso, it remains to be seen whether these measures can, by their cumulative effect, be considered a violation of the FET standard.\n\n*(ii) The Overall Cumulative Impact of the Measures with Regard to the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n510.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[a]n investor will never invest if it expects that the rules of the game will be completely altered in a manner it cannot predict.\"480 It asserts that there were commitments by the GOA that it would not be affected by a new crisis in that country because all the main parameters were either in dollars or linked to the dollar: the electricity Spot Price was connected with the US PPI, adjusted bi-annually (a kind of *de facto* dollarisation); the VPCs were declared in dollars bi-annually; and the capacity payments were in dollars. According to El Paso, as a foreign company investing money in Argentina\u2019s economy, it relied on the overall setting of the legal framework, which was clearly aimed at protecting the foreign investor from a devaluation of the dollar. These features were of the utmost importance due to the economic history of Argentina.\n\nReply \u00a7 91.\n\n511.\n\nFor example, the fact that capacity payments would be in the same currency as the investment, so that they would be immune from devaluation, was a strong incentive to invest in Argentina despite the frequent crises that had occurred throughout the country\u2019s history. The dollar calculation was intended to protect the investor from devaluation. According to Robert L. Perez, an expert witness for the Claimant, the existence of capacity payments made investments in companies such as CAPEX and Costanera attractive to potential investors such as El Paso because they could make the investment, knowing that they would be able to upgrade the plant without the risk of losing their capital costs:\n\n\"These capacity payments would be in U.S. Dollars because investors would only be able to capitalize their investment in U.S. Dollar terms (including loans, equity, etc.... since it was highly unlikely that Argentine banks could supply the amounts needed by investors to upgrade facilities. Thus, the declarations of variable production costs and the denomination of capacity payments in U.S. Dollars was significant to potential foreign investors like El Paso. When El Paso made its decision to enter Argentina\u2019s electricity sector, it fundamentally relied on the assurance of these capacity payments in assuring that CAPEX would be able to service US Dollar debt and be able to provide a reasonable return to us.\"481\n\n*Witness Statement of Robert L. Perez* [hereinafter Perez Witness Statement], 17 August 2004, \u00a7\u00a7 50-52, Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 8.\n\n512.\n\nThe problem, therefore, was not so much whether the capacity payment should be at 4, 5 or 10 dollars; it was the calculation in US dollars that mattered to the foreign investor. But the GOA disregarded the very reason for which capacity payments were created, which was to attract investment to expand capacity by allowing generators to recover their capital expenditures in US dollars, in destroying the link between capacity payments and computation in dollars.\n\n513.\n\nIn the same manner, based on the assurances generally contained in the Electricity Regulatory Framework, investors such as El Paso could reasonably expect that a devaluation of the peso would not substantially alter the dollar value of Spot Prices.\n\n514.\n\nThe fact that the contracts were in US dollars could also be viewed as a special commitment towards the companies in which El Paso invested, and the pesification as entailing a violation of freely agreed terms and conditions.\n\n515.\n\nAlthough they may be seen in isolation as reasonable measures to cope with a difficult economic situation, the measures examined can be viewed as cumulative steps which individually do not qualify as violations of FET, as pointed out earlier by the Tribunal, but which amount to a violation if their cumulative effect is considered. It is quite possible to hold that Argentina could pesify, put a cap on the Spot Price, etc., but that a combination of all these measures completely altered the overall framework.\n\n516.\n\nAccording to the Tribunal, this series of measures amounts to a composite act, as suggested by the International Law Commission in its Articles on State Responsibility (Article 15).482 Such an analysis is not without precedent. The tribunal in *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,* for example, referred to the concept of composite act and stated clearly that acts that are not illegal can become such by accumulation:\n\n\"While normally acts will take place at a given point in time independently of their continuing effects, and they might at that point be wrongful or not, it is conceivable also that there might be situations in which each act considered in isolation will not result in a breach of a treaty obligation, but if considered as a part of a series of acts leading in the same direction they could result in a breach at the end of the process of aggregation...\"483\n\nThe General Assembly of the United Nations took note of the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, presented by the International Law Commission, and commended them to the attention of governments, in a resolution adopted on 12 December 2001, UN Doc. A/RES/56/83; see also *Report of the International Law Commission on the Work of its Fifty-third Session* (2001), UNGA Official Records. Suppl. No. 10, A/56/10, pp. 43-365. For a number of general comments, see James Crawford, *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility. Introduction, Text and Commentaries,* Cambridge, Cambridge U. Press (2002).\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. The Dominican Republic* [hereinafter *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale],* LCIA Case No. UN7927, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction of 19 September 2008, \u00a7 91.\n\n517.\n\nIt cannot be denied that in the matter before this Tribunal the cumulative effect of the measures was a total alteration of the entire legal setup for foreign investments, and that all the different elements and guarantees just mentioned can be analysed as a special commitment of Argentina that such a total alteration would not take place. As stated by the tribunal in *LG&E,* when evaluating the same events, \"here, the Tribunal is of the opinion that Argentina went too far by completely dismantling the very legal framework constructed to attract investors.484\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7 139.\n\n518.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, in the same way as one can speak of *creeping expropriation,* there can also be creeping violations of the FET standard. According to the case-law, a creeping expropriation is a process extending over time and composed of a succession or accumulation of measures which, taken separately, would not have the effect of dispossessing the investor but, when viewed as a whole, do lead to that result. A *creeping violation of the FET standard* could thus be described as a process extending over time and comprising a succession or an accumulation of measures which, taken separately, would not breach that standard but, when taken together, do lead to such a result.\n\n519.\n\nThe Tribunal, taking an all-encompassing view of consequences of the measures complained of by El Paso, including the contribution of these measures to its decision to sell its investments in Argentina, concludes that, by their cumulative effect, they amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\nG. Full Protection and Security\n-------------------------------\n\n***1. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n520.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the full protection and security (FPS) provision of the BIT is, like FET, a standard different from and higher than the full protection and security required by international law:\n\n\"The duty to provide full protection and security creates an independent treaty obligation that is distinct from a state\u2019s obligation under customary international law.\"485\n\nThe Claimant considers that FPS imposes obligations of due diligence and vigilance on Argentina and is not limited to physical security or the performance of its basic police functions by the State. For the Claimant, the FPS standard is sufficiently broad \"to provide protection against the measures taken by the GOA;\"486 and in its view, \"by its ordinary meaning, the phrase \u2018full protection and security\u2019 must include the \u2018full\u2019 security provided through legal and regulatory frameworks, not mere physical security.\"487 As a consequence of this broad interpretation, the Claimant asserts in its Reply that \"Argentina, acting in its sovereign capacity, failed to provide full protection and security to El Paso\u2019s investment by, *inter alia:*\n\n- disregarding and violating numerous key provisions of the Electricity Law;\n\n- transforming the electricity sector from a competitive, market-based system to a fully-regulated industry characterized by government intervention and price manipulation;\n\n- radically altering the Spot Price setting mechanism by creating Spot Price caps and artificially lowering the Maximum Recognized VCP through the market price of various fuels from the setting of the Spot Price and the generators\u2019 VCPs that exceeded the VCPs allowed by the Energy Secretariat;\n\n- converting capacity payments from Dollars, as offered by the GOA in the Electricity Regulatory Framework in order to attract investments, to Argentine Pesos at a rate that decreased such payments to 40% of their original value;\n\n- locking generators into frozen and depressed electricity prices by freezing the Seasonal Price at the nominal value in Pesos and failing to fund the Seasonal Stabilization Fund;\n\n- imposing Export Withholdings on crude oil and LPG exports through Article 6 of Law N\u00b0 25,561 and Decree N\u00b0 310/2002, in violation of the stabilization provisions of the Mining Code and the Hydrocarbon Deregulation Decrees that enjoy legislative status, and the Concessions;\n\n- violating CAPSA\u2019s, CAPEX\u2019s and COSTANERA\u2019s contractual rights by imposing a mandatory conversion of Dollar-denominated energy, LPG, and crude oil term contracts with third parties to Pesos at an artificially-low and confiscatory exchange rate;\n\n- violating SERVICIOS\u2019 contractual rights by pesifying its Gas Processing Agreement at an artificially-low exchange rate;\n\n- imposing quotas on LPG and crude oil exports in direct violation of Decrees N\u00b0 1589/1989, N\u00b0 1055/1989 and N\u00b0 1212/1989, which guarantee the right to export freely; and\n\n- coercing CAPSA and CAPEX to renegotiate and enter into new LPG and crude oil supply agreements.\"488\n\nReply, \u00a7 630.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 633.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 634.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 647. Footnotes omitted.\n\n521.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, on the contrary, \"like the fair and equitable treatment standard, the protection and security standard relates to the international law minimum standard.\"489 In order to give content to that standard, Argentina contends that:\n\n\"In conformity with this interpretation, the protection and security standard is no more than the traditional obligation to protect aliens under international customary law. It is a residual obligation provided for the cases in which the challenged acts may not be in themselves attributed to the Government, but to a third party. In these assumptions, the Government must act diligently to prevent and penalize illegitimate acts by third parties damaging aliens.\"490\n\nThe obligation of due diligence implies a certain number of consequences, among which the most important is that the State authorities are \"obliged to protect aliens from acts not attributable to themselves, but stemming from third parties.\"491 In light of this first condition, the Respondent points out that, in the present case, none of the measures challenged by El Paso stems from a third party; all of them were taken by the State itself. Consequently, according to the Respondent, such measures should only be examined in the light of the other standards of the BIT and not under the full protection and security standard.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 466.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 467.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 469.\n\n***2. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n522.\n\nThe BIT requires that Argentina provide \"full protection and security\" to El Paso\u2019s investment.492 The Tribunal considers that the full protection and security standard is no more than the traditional obligation to protect aliens under international customary law and that it is a residual obligation provided for those cases in which the acts challenged may not in themselves be attributed to the Government, but to a third party. The case-law and commentators generally agree that this standard imposes an obligation of vigilance and due diligence upon the government.493 The *AAPL* decision quotes with approval Professor Freeman\u2019s definition of due diligence:\n\n\"The \u2018due diligence\u2019 is nothing more nor less than the reasonable measures of prevention which a well-administered government could be expected to exercise under similar circumstances.\"494\n\nAnd in the *AMT* case, the tribunal explained:\n\n\"These treatments of protection and security of investment required by the provisions of the BIT of which AMT is beneficiary must be in conformity with its applicable national laws and must not be any less than those recognized by international law. For the Tribunal, this last requirement is fundamental for the determination of the responsibility of Zaire. It is thus an objective obligation which must not be inferior to the minimum standard of vigilance and of care required by international law.\"495\n\nBIT, Article Il(2)(a).\n\nSee, e.g., *American Manufacturing. & Trading, Inc. (AMT) v. Democratic Republic of Congo* (earlier referred to as Republic of Zaire) [hereinafter *AMT],* (ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1), Award of 21 February 1997, \u00a7 6.05; *AAPL, supra* note 41, \u00a7 50. See also: Rudolf Dolzer and Margrete Stevens, *Bilateral Investment Treaties,* The Hague, Kluwer Law International, 1995, pp. 60-61.\n\n*AAPL, supra* note 41, \u00a7 77.\n\n*AMT, supra* note 493 \u00a7 6.06.\n\n523.\n\nThe minimum standard of vigilance and care set by international law comprises a duty of prevention and a duty of repression. A well-established aspect of the international standard of treatment is that States must use \"due diligence\" to prevent wrongful injuries to the person or property of aliens caused by third parties within their territory, and, if they did not succeed, exercise at least \"due diligence\" to punish such injuries. If a State fails to exercise due diligence to prevent or punish such injuries, it is responsible for this omission and is liable for the ensuing damage. It should be emphasised that the obligation to show \"due diligence\" does not mean that the State has to prevent each and every injury. Rather, the obligation is generally understood as requiring that the State take reasonable actions within its power to avoid injury when it is, or should be, aware that there is a risk of injury. The precise degree of care, of what is \"reasonable\" or \"due,\" depends in part on the circumstances.\n\n524.\n\nHowever, El Paso does not complain about a violation by Argentina of an obligation of prevention or repression. In the *Tecmed* case, the tribunal made the same interpretation as this Tribunal and said the following:\n\n\"The Arbitral Tribunal considers that the Claimant has not furnished evidence to prove that the Mexican authorities, regardless of their level, have encouraged, fostered, or contributed their support to the people or groups that conducted the community and political movements against the Landfill..,\"496\n\nEl Paso did not specify or determine the duty to act against a third party that has allegedly been breached by Argentina under the BIT : all the impugned acts that allegedly violate the FPS standard are directly attributable to the GOA and not to any third party. In the present case, none of the measures challenged by El Paso were taken by a third party; they all emanated from the State itself. Consequently, these measures should only be assessed in the light of the other BIT standards and cannot be examined from the angle of full protection and security.\n\n*Tecmed, supra* note 161, \u00a7 176.\n\n525.\n\nThe conclusion is that there is no trace of a violation of the full protection and security standard by any of the GOA\u2019s measures impugned by the Claimant.\n\nH. Article II(2)(c): The Umbrella Clause\n----------------------------------------\n\n526.\n\nThe so-called umbrella clause contained in Article II(2)(c) provides as follows:\n\n\"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"\n\n***1. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n527.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent violated the BIT by failing to observe its obligations under Article II(2)(c).497 In particular, the breach of some contractual rights of the Argentinian companies was complained of under that provision. The Claimant asserted that under Article II(2)(c) Argentina had assumed an obligation, *inter alia:*\n\n\"To respect the terms of the Concessions that provide fiscal stability and not impose in the future either Export Withholdings nor discriminatory taxes.\n\nTo respect the right of power generators and hydrocarbon producers, like CAPSA, CAPEX and COSTANERA, to freely sell their production and agree on the terms governing its sale, including price and currency.\n\n\u2026\n\nTo respect the license agreements with gas distribution companies and power distributors to pass through to their tariffs the market price of the gas and electricity they acquire from gas producers and power generators.498\n\nThese are all contractual rights belonging to the Argentinian companies, CAPSA, CAPEX and Costanera.\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 539-546.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 545; see also Reply, \u00a7 602.\n\n528.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s answer can be summarised as follows: According to Argentina, the umbrella clause only applies to investment agreements entered into with foreign investors, not to hydrocarbon concessions granted by the State to national companies. In other words, there are no contractual commitments directly between the Claimant and Argentina, as any such commitments were made to CAPSA and CAPEX *via* the concessions and are not protected rights under the BIT.499\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 669-705.\n\n529.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant has added to its initial analysis the idea that even if they are not elevated to the rank of treaty claims under Article II(2)(c), the contractual claims should still be seen as having led to a violation of this provision, as the concessions can be characterised as \"investment agreements\":\n\n\"Nonetheless, even if Argentina\u2019s characterization of the scope of the Umbrella Clause were correct, which it is not, Argentina\u2019s abrogation and repudiation of its commitments in the Concessions, the CAPSA Hydrocarbon Regulatory Framework, the Hydrocarbon Regulatory Framework, and the Electricity Regulatory Framework would still violate the Umbrella Clause because each of the Concessions qualifies as an \u2018investment agreement\u2019 under the BIT.\"500\n\nAnd there follows a list of alleged contractual breaches of these investment agreements:\n\n\"The GOA violated the Umbrella Clause by:\n\n- unilaterally interfering in the contracts of private parties *(i.e.,* the electricity and hydrocarbon sale contracts of CAPEX, COSTANERA and CAPSA and SERVICIOS\u2019 Gas Processing Agreement) by decreeing that their price terms be converted from Dollars to Pesos at the artificially low exchange rate of US$ 1 - to - Arg. 1;\n\n- breaching the CAPEX Concession (which had generally incorporated the provisions of Decree N\u00b0 1589/1989) and the CAPSA Concessions that benefited from the tax exemption established by Article 403 of the Mining Code by imposing Export Withholdings;\n\n- breaching the license agreements of gas and electricity distributors by pesifying them and abrogating their US price index and US Dollar terms, which had a direct and immediate financial impact on electricity generators.\"501\n\nReply, \u00a7 613.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 627.\n\n530.\n\nThe Respondent again rejected this line of argument, stating that\n\n\"[t]he Argentine Republic did not violate the umbrella clause [because]... (a) the scope of the umbrella clause is limited to the commitments assumed in an investment agreement; (b) there is no investment agreement in the present case.\"502\n\nIn order to explain why no \"investment agreement\" was at stake here, Argentina explained that\n\n\"CAPSA and CAPEX concessions may never be put at the same level as an investment agreement since:\n\n(a) they were not concluded between Argentina and a foreign investor, but granted by the Argentine Republic to local companies;\n\n(b) they are governed by Argentine law and subject to Argentine courts; and\n\n(c) they do not have any element internationalising it or provision linking them - not even indirectly - to the investment protection system provided for in bilateral investment treaties.\"503\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 488.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 501.\n\n***2. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n531.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal rejected the argument that the so-called umbrella clause included in Article II(2)(c) could elevate any contract claim to the level of a treaty claim:\n\n\"In other words, the Tribunal, endorsing the interpretation first given to the so-called \u2018umbrella clause\u2019 in the Decision *SGS v. Pakistan,* confirms what it mentioned above, namely, that it has jurisdiction over treaty claims and cannot entertain purely contractual claims, which do not amount to a violation of the standards of protection of the BIT. It adds that, in view of Article VII(1) of the US-Argentina BIT, a violation of an investment agreement entered into by the State as a sovereign and an American national or company is deemed to be also a violation of the Treaty and can thus give rise to a treaty claim.\"504\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, *supra* note 58, \u00a7 85.\n\n532.\n\nThis means that a contract claim is not transformed into a treaty claim by the umbrella clause, while an \"investment agreement\" claim can be viewed as a treaty claim by virtue of a combination of Articles VII(1) and II(2)(c): \"[m]oreover, Article II, read in conjunction with Article VII(1), also considers as treaty claims the breaches of an investment agreement between Argentina and a national or company of the United States.\"505 In other words, although in general a contract claim is not a treaty claim, the violation of an investment agreement can be considered a treaty claim as it is an obligation entered into with regard to investments under Article VII(1).\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 84.\n\n533.\n\nThe Tribunal has already decided that El Paso has no contract claim based on contracts or licenses (see *supra* \u00a7\u00a7 178-189) and that there is no investment agreement entered into by El Paso (see *supra* \u00a7\u00a7 190-198). As a consequence, the question of their elevation to the level of a treaty claim does not arise.\n\n534.\n\nThe Tribunal wishes to add that this position finds support in the Annulment Decision in the *CMS* case.506 It may be recalled that the ICSID tribunal dealing with that case had concluded in its Award of 12 May 2005 that there was a violation of the so-called umbrella clause included in Article II(2)(c):\n\n\"... the obligation under the umbrella clause of Article II(2)(c) of the treaty has not been observed by the Respondent to the extent that legal and contractual obligations pertinent to the investment have been breached and have resulted in the violation of the standards of protection under the Treaty.\"507\n\nIn particular, this finding applied to two aspects of the commitments that the claimant CMS considered to have been made by Argentina in its favour, *i. e.*\n\n\"... two stabilization clauses contained in the License that have significant effect when it comes to the protection extended to them under the umbrella clause. The first is the obligation undertaken not to freeze the tariff regime or subject it to price controls. The second is the obligation not to alter the basic rules governing the License without TGN\u2019s written consent.\"508\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, Decision on Annulment.\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48,\u00a7 303.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 302.\n\n535.\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee criticised the tribunal\u2019s findings concerning the violation of the umbrella clause, stating that it was \"impossible for the reader to follow the reasoning on this point,\"509 and therefore annulled this part of the decision for failure to state reasons. At the same time, it tried to reconstruct the possible reasoning of the Tribunal and, while doing so, gave some hints as to what could, in its view, be the possible meaning of an umbrella clause or, to be more precise, as to what could not be the meaning of an umbrella clause. Thus, two points were made clear by the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, Decision on Annulment, \u00a7 97.\n\n536.\n\nFirst, according to that Committee, the umbrella clause, if it had any meaning -a question on which it did not take a position - could only concern consensual obligations and not general obligations:\n\n\"In speaking of \u2018any obligations it may have *entered into* with regard to investment,\u2019 it seems clear that Article II(2)(c) is concerned with consensual obligations arising independently of the BIT... They do not cover general requirements imposed by law.\"510\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 95. Emphasis added by the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n537.\n\nSecond, the *ad hoc* Committee also made it clear that, in its view, a contractual obligation towards a non-protected investor cannot be transformed by the magic of the so-called umbrella clause into a treaty obligation towards a protected investor:\n\n\"The effect of the umbrella clause is not to transform the obligation which is relied on into something else; the content of the obligation is unaffected, as is its proper law. If this is so, it would appear that the *parties* to the obligation *(i.e.* the persons bound by it and entitled to rely on it) are likewise not changed because of the umbrella clause.\"511\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 95. Emphasis added by the *ad hoc* Committee.\n\n538.\n\nIt is evident that the Tribunal cannot find any violation of a right pertaining to El Paso under the so-called umbrella clause, for the reason that the so-called umbrella clause cannot not elevate any contract claims to the status of treaty claims as El Paso cannot claim a contractual right of its own in this case.\n\n**V. CAN THE VIOLATIONS COMMITTED BY ARGENTINA BE PREVENTED OR EXCUSED?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. Can the Violations Committed by Argentina be Excused on Account of the Consent Allegedly Given through the Signature of Agreements?\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***1. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n*(i) The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n539.\n\nThe Republic of Argentina contends that El Paso\u2019s argument is inconsistent with the very actions of the Argentinian companies it is now claiming for. As a matter of fact, both CAPSA and CAPEX (together with many other companies in the same sector) entered into at least eight agreements with the GOA during the years 2002 and 2003 by which they recognised the Government\u2019s power to impose export duties on oil and gas and to take other measures. Through these agreements, the companies obtained advantages which, naturally, proved beneficial to their shareholders. In its damages estimate, El Paso omitted to consider these benefits.\n\n540.\n\nEven if El Paso was a non-controlling shareholder of the companies in question and not a party to the various agreements with the Government, the fact remains that the companies entered into agreements by which the GOA\u2019s powers were recognised. Furthermore, there is no evidence that these agreements were concluded under duress, as alleged by El Paso, nor has any producer in the last five years challenged the voluntary nature of these agreements.\n\n541.\n\nAll the measures contested by El Paso (except for the export restrictions and the pesification) were expressly consented to by the Argentinian companies. A shareholder may not claim compensation for a measure concerning the rights of a company in which it holds a participating interest when the company in question has consented to such a measure. As a minority shareholder, El Paso should address its claim to the majority shareholder, not to the GOA.\n\n*(ii) The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n------------------------------\n\n542.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it was not a Party to the agreements with the Government, the latter having been signed by the Argentinian companies together with other oil companies. In addition, El Paso was a minority, noncontrolling shareholder, and therefore not in a position to determine the decisions of the companies.\n\n543.\n\nThe Claimant also disputes the purported voluntary nature of these agreements, arguing that they were signed under duress. In fact, the GOA had threatened to impose higher export duties or artificially to depress domestic prices in the event of a failure to accept the agreements. Thus, to sign them was a way to mitigate damages.\n\n544.\n\nRegarding the Crude Oil Special Arrangements, in the absence of Government pressures, no rational crude oil producer would have agreed to a US$ 28.50 reference value for which the producers received nothing in exchange. Similar pressure was exercised regarding the LPG Price Stabilisation Agreement, which was concluded under the Government\u2019s threat to depress domestic prices artificially.\n\n545.\n\nNone of the agreements signed by CAPSA, CAPEX or Costanera, while El Paso was a shareholder, contains any acquiescence to the export withholdings or any waiver of legal rights, express or implied. In international law, waivers require a clear and unambiguous expression of consent.\n\n546.\n\nIn any event, as shown in *CMS* and *LG&E,* the presence of duress will not only invalidate a waiver but, in addition, confirm that the State has breached the BIT.\n\n547.\n\nNo objections were filed by El Paso before the courts of Argentina for a number of reasons, including the risk that raising a claim before the local courts could trigger the \"fork-in-the-road\" clause of the BIT (Articles VII (2) and (3)).\n\n548.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s waiver claim assumes that El Paso is bound by the signing of the special agreements by CAPSA, CAPEX and Costanera. This, according to the Claimant, is wrong. As illustrated by *GAMI Investments v. Mexico,512* the decision of the local company (in that case, to pursue domestic remedies) cannot affect the right of a minority shareholder to claim under the applicable treaty. The same conclusion was reached by the *LG&E, Enron* and *Azurix* tribunals in their awards against the Republic of Argentina.\n\n*GAMI Investments Corp. v. The Government of the United Mexican States* [hereinafter *GAMT\\,* UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Final Award of 15 November 2004, \u00a7 38.\n\n***2. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n549.\n\nAs noted by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction when referring to the Decision on Jurisdiction in the *LG&E* case, the shares owned by El Paso in the Argentinian companies constitute the Claimant\u2019s investment in Argentina within the meaning of Article I (1)(a)(ii) of the BIT. This has been reiterated in paragraph 214 of the present Award. A clear distinction must therefore be made between the Claimant as an investor under the BIT and the Argentinian companies in which the Claimant participated and which operated in Argentina under local laws and regulations. Bearing in mind this distinction, the Respondent\u2019s contention that El Paso consented to export withholdings or other measures taken by the GOA by not objecting to the signing by CAPEX, CAPSA and Costanera of a number of agreements with the Government may not be shared. El Paso may not, in fact, be equated to the companies in which it was only a minority, non-controlling shareholder. Actions by the Argentinian companies cannot affect El Paso\u2019s rights as an investor under the BIT, except to the extent to which it has consented to such actions. However, there is no evidence of such consent.\n\n550.\n\nContrary to the Respondent\u2019s allegation, El Paso is not claiming *for* the Argentinian companies; nor is it acting for their benefit or on their behalf. The claims filed by El Paso in these proceedings are those of an investor requesting compensation for the breach by the State of a certain number of guarantees provided by the BIT, an international treaty. El Paso is therefore claiming in its own right, not in somebody else\u2019s. The fact that El Paso as a shareholder may have derived benefits from the agreements entered into by the companies and that such advantages have to be considered when evaluating its damages does not contradict this conclusion. The shareholding in the companies being the investment made by El Paso in Argentina, the damage to that investment caused by the breach of the BIT must obviously be calculated by taking into account any benefits accruing from the agreements in question or from the Government\u2019s measures.\n\n551.\n\nThis being the nature of El Paso\u2019s claims, and in the absence of any consent to the Argentinian companies entering into the agreements with the Government, no waiver of rights and claims accruing under the BIT may be imputed to El Paso. The Argentinian companies\u2019 decisions and their agreements with the GOA therefore have no impact on El Paso\u2019s rights under the BIT, the breach of which is the cause of action in these proceedings.\n\nB. Can the Violations Committed by Argentina Have Been Prevented Or Be Excused on Account of The Existence of a State of Necessity?\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n552.\n\nThe Tribunal will first examine the defense allegedly provided by Article IV (3) of the BIT. It will then address the two other Articles invoked by Argentina to avoid any responsibility for the measures taken to face the economic crisis, Article XI of the BIT and Article 25 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. The Tribunal will concentrate on the arguments based on Article XI first because, as was also stated by the tribunal in the case of *Continental,* \"the application of Art. XI in the present case (if warranted) may be such as to render superfluous a detailed examination of the defense of necessity under general international law applied to the particular facts of the present dispute.\"513 Of course, Article XI has to be interpreted taking into account general principles of international law, some of those being embodied in Article 25, as mentioned below in paragraph 590. And only if Article XI is found by\n\nthe Tribunal not to apply in the case would an analysis of Article 25 be performed. Article XI is the *lex specialis,* Article 25, the *lex generalis.* As the Tribunal will consider Article XI of the BIT to apply to the case, it can dispense to fully analyse and to apply as such Article 25 of the ILC Articles.\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 162.\n\n553.\n\nIt is however appropriate for the Tribunal to emphasise the difference between the two defences based on Article XI of the BIT and on Article 25 in general international law. Under Article XI, measures necessary \"for the maintenance of the public order\" or for \"the protection of essential security interests\" are not in breach of the relevant BIT, and therefore it would have been appropriate for the Tribunal to analyse the existence of a situation of necessity under Article XI even before evaluating the different measures adopted. On the contrary, if the rules of general international law regarding necessity apply, this is a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation and thus implies that the acts be analysed first. This difference was clearly emphasised in a statement found in the Annulment Decision in *CMS:*\n\n\"Article XI is a threshold requirement: if it applies, the substantive obligations under the Treaty do not apply. By contrast, Article 25 is an excuse which is only relevant once it has been decided that there has otherwise been a breach of those substantive obligations.\"514\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, Decision on Annulment, \u00a7 129.\n\n554.\n\nIn other words, in order to analyse the consequences of Article XI, the first question to answer is whether there was a situation of emergency as defined by that Article. If the answer is in the affirmative, all the acts considered necessary by the Tribunal to cope with this situation are excluded from the scope of the BIT, the contrary being true of the acts not considered necessary by the Tribunal. If the answer is in the negative, the Tribunal has to examine the different measures taken in order to determine whether or not they are in violation of one of the BIT standards of treatment of foreign investments. To analyse the consequences of Article 25, the reverse approach is required. The Tribunal should first analyse whether or not the measures constitute a violation of the standards of treatment of the BIT. If the answer is no, this marks the end of the inquiry. If the answer is in the affirmative, the Tribunal has to consider whether the illegality can be set aside on account of a state of necessity.\n\n555.\n\nHowever, in order to analyse the consequences of Article XI, the Tribunal has chosen to proceed as follows. It will first answer the question whether by its behaviour the State has contributed to endangering its public order or essential security interests. If the answer is in the affirmative, the defence under Article XI shall not apply since the challenged measures would fail to qualify as \"necessary\" under that Article. If the answer is in the negative, the Tribunal has to examine whether there was a situation of emergency as defined by Article XI, in which case, in the affirmative, all acts considered necessary by the Tribunal to cope with that situation are excluded from the scope of the BIT.\"\n\n***1. Can the Violations Committed by Argentina Be Excused on the Basis of Article IV(3)?***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n556.\n\nArticle IV (3) of the BIT provides:\n\n\"Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded treatment by such other Party no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.\"\n\n*(i) The Parties\u2019 Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n557.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, \"[i]n reality, Article IV(3) of the BIT is completely irrelevant to Argentina\u2019s defense of necessity.\"515 As explained by El Paso, that provision deals with possible measures taken by a State to compensate losses that have occurred due, for example, to war or civil disturbances. It does not apply as an excuse based on necessity or emergency: \"Since Article IV(3) relates to compensatory measures rather than acts that cause an investor\u2019s loss, it provides no guidance as to whether such acts are excusable in a given context.\"516\n\nReply, \u00a7 806.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 816.\n\n558.\n\nThe Respondent has a different interpretation of Article IV(3), arguing that the emergency measures challenged are indeed authorised by that provision:\n\n\"The BIT expressly mentions the adoption of emergency measures by a state, which may generate losses to the investments of the other contracting party. Not only does it point out this possibility, but it also legitimises the act from Government [sic]....\"517\n\nIn fact, Argentina equates \"measures adopted in relation to losses due to an emergency situation\" with \"measures to be adopted to mitigate the crisis or emergency\"518 and then concludes that the only obligation of a State during a period of emergency is to accord foreign investors\" treatment that is not discriminatory. Stating that \"upon the state of emergency, El Paso received the same treatment as the other national and foreign companies that were engaged in the provision of similar services,\"519 it concludes that Argentina fully complied with its obligations towards the foreign investor. The position of the GOA is that \"Article IV(3) provides for a special solution in the event of an exceptional situation, which proves that the general obligations contained in the treaty are only applicable in \u2018normal\u2019 circumstances.\"520\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 724.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 724.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 731.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 527.\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n------------------------------\n\n559.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot accept the Respondent\u2019s interpretation, which goes against the plain meaning of the text, and it agrees with the Claimant that Article IV(3) applies to measures adopted in response to a loss, not to measures that cause a loss. The plain meaning of the provision is that the standards of treatment of the BIT - national treatment and most favoured nation treatment - have to be applied when a State tries to mitigate the consequences of war or other emergency. This is in line with the analysis of the same provision made by the tribunal in *CMS* when it pointed out that:\n\n\"The plain meaning of the Article is to provide a floor treatment for the investor in the context of the measures adopted in respect of the losses suffered in the emergency, not different from that applied to nationals or other foreigners. The Article... ensures that any measures directed at offsetting or minimizing losses will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner.\"521\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 375.\n\n560.\n\nIt is therefore the conclusion of the Tribunal that the violations committed by Argentina cannot be excused by Article IV (3), as that provision does not deal with the matter at hand.\n\n***2. Can the Violations Committed by Argentina be Excused on the Basis of Article XI?***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n561.\n\nIn its written and oral presentations, Argentina has justified its conduct by invoking Article XI of the 1991 Argentina-US BIT. That provision reads:\n\n\"This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.\"\n\nThis is obviously an important provision, as recognised by Professsor Michael Reisman, an expert called by the Claimant, who stated during the hearing that:\n\n\"Obviously the Parties felt that this assurance was critical to them. Whether this could have been available as a matter of general international law to the Parties is another matter. But by establishing this particular regime in Article 11 the Parties indicated that customary international law that might otherwise govern would not govern, and that this would be the provision for those circumstances, what we generally refer to as necessity.\"522\n\nHearing Transcript in English, Day 3, p. 752.\n\n562.\n\nThis provision raises the following questions: Who is entitled to interpret Article XI authoritatively? Do the provisions of that Article apply to the present dispute? If so, does its applicability exonerate Argentina from any duty to pay compensation?\n\n*(i) The Question of Whether Article XI Is Self-judging: Who Is Entitled to Interpret Article XI?*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n563.\n\nIn its pleadings, Argentina, partly basing itself on expert legal opinions,523 contended that each Contracting Party was entitled to interpret the terms of Article XI of the Argentina-US Treaty with final effect, subject only to the principle of good faith. Argentina\u2019s thesis can be summarised as follows.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 533-546; *Witness Statement of Anne-Marie Slaughter and William Burke-White* [hereinafter Slaughter/Burke-White Report] of 4 March 2007; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, Annexes, \u00a7\u00a7 15, 18-36; Somarajah Report, *supra* note 76, \u00a7\u00a7 107-109.\n\n564.\n\nIt is true that, unlike the provisions of other treaties, such as Article XXI of the GATT,524 Article XI of the 1991 Argentina-US BIT does not expressly state that it is self-judging. It nevertheless exhibits that characteristic because this is the position of both Contracting Parties: that of the United States since 1986, when it argued, in the *Nicaragua* case, that the International Court of Justice (hereinafter: ICJ) had to examine525 whether a similar provision contained in the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation (hereafter: FCN) concluded on 21 January 1956 between the US and Nicaragua526 was self-judging in character; this was the position of Argentina was well.\n\nArticle XXI of the GATT 1947 (United Nations Treaty Series, Vol. 55, p. 187) provides that \"[n]othing in the Agreement shall be construed... (b) to prevent any Contracting Party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.\"\n\n*Case concerning* *Military and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua* (hereinafter *Nicaragua v. United States),* Merits, Judgment of 27 June 1986, ICJ Reports 1986, p. 14.\n\nSlaughter/Burke-White Report, *supra note* 523, \u00a7\u00a7 18-36. For the text of the FCN, see http://untreaty.un.org/unts/l\\_60000/10/37/00019817.pdf\n\n565.\n\nThe self-judging character of Article XI of the BIT can, according to the respondent State, be deduced from its text, read in its context, and from the object and purpose of the Treaty, the preparatory work and the circumstances surrounding its conclusion.527 This character also results from the position taken by the US Department of State at the time of the BIT\u2019s approval by the US Senate, which amounts to an interpretative declaration in the sense of Article 31 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.528\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 16. Article 31 of the 1969 Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties runs as follows:  \n\"1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.  \n 2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:  \n (a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;  \n (b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.  \n 3.

A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\"\n\nSlaughter/Burke-White Report, *supra note* 523, \u00a7 16.\n\n566.\n\nRegarding the texts of Articles XXI of the GATT and XXI of the Nicaragua-US FCN, they are not, according to Argentina, relevant for interpreting the Argentina-US BIT; they are not, in particular, part of that instrument\u2019s context in the sense of Article 31 of the 1969 Vienna Convention\u00a0on the Law of Treaties. The same can be said of Article XX(1)(d) of the Iran-US Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations and Consular Relations, of 15 August 1955.529\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 33.\n\n567.\n\nSo far as the ruling of the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case is concerned, Argentina considers it to have no bearing on the present arbitration because: (i) at the time when that case was decided, the evidence for ascertaining the Parties\u2019 positions was insufficient, and the US began to make statements on the matter precisely on the basis of that case; (ii) Nicaragua and the US held conflicting views in the *Nicaragua* case, the former contending that the contested provision was not self-judging, the latter holding the opposite view, whereas in the present arbitration the States involved are of the same opinion, namely, that Article XI of the 1991 BIT *is* self-judging; and (iii) the circumstances surrounding the two cases are different, the US having invoked the self-judging character of the relevant clause in *Nicaragua* to legitimise the use of force against another State, whereas, in the present instance, Argentina does so to justify domestic economic measures \"sought to pacify the country, maintain public order and national security.\"530\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 537.\n\n568.\n\nAccording to the respondent State, there is evidence showing that both the US and Argentina considered Article XI of their BIT to be self-judging. One evidential element is the fact that in August 1992, barely one year following the conclusion of the Treaty but prior to its ratification, the US Department of State submitted five BITs and a model BIT to the US Senate for approval. Each provision of the Model BIT was accompanied by commentaries; and the commentary on Article X - whose text is identical to Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT - explained that the provision was self-judging and that this feature was carefully recorded by the US State Department in each negotiation.531\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 538.\n\n569.\n\nIn *LG&E,532* the tribunal considered the date of conclusion of the Argentina-US BIT rather than that of ratification to be relevant for ascertaining the meaning of treaty clauses, says Argentina. But, in view of the declaration by the US Senate,533 there are strong reasons to believe that even at the time of concluding their BIT, both the US and Argentina believed its Article XI to be self-judging. Further, when Argentina ratified the BIT in 1994, it was well aware of the position taken by the United States in 1992.\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 539; Slaughter/Burke-White Report, *supra* note 523, \u00a7 20.\n\n570.\n\nIt may be presumed, always according to Argentina, that all bilateral investment treaties concluded by the US follow the 1992 Model Treaty, unless the State Department, in its letter accompanying the text of treaties on the occasion of their submission to the Senate, indicates otherwise, which is not the case here. As no contrary evidence has been presented by the Claimant, Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT must be deemed self-judging.\n\n571.\n\nThe same obtains on the side of Argentina, the other Contracting Party. True, when the BIT between the US and Russia was being negotiated, it was the Russian negotiators who wished to specify that the Treaty\u2019s provision corresponding to Article XI of the Argentina-US Treaty was self-judging. This cannot, however, be taken to mean, *a contrario,* that Article XI, for the United States, does not have that characteristic as well.\n\n572.\n\nThe United States view, while it has grown more explicit, has not changed at least since 1984, when it was put forth in the *Nicaragua* case. An inevitable consequence of that view is, as explained by the US Government to the US Senate, that self-judging clauses in BITs could also be invoked, on the basis of reciprocity, by the other Contracting Party, to the detriment of US investors, this being the price to pay for the United States\u2019 freedom of action under the BITs.\n\n573.\n\nArgentina concludes its arguments by asserting that the self-judging nature of provisions such as Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT promotes, rather than undermines, international law. It confirms the contractual freedom of States within the mandatory framework of *jus cogens* and, accordingly, strengthens the concept of sovereignty. Another restriction based on the power of self-judging clauses is that recourse to such a clause is limited by the principle of good faith.\n\n*(b) The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n574.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT is not self-judging.534 It begins its argument by pointing out that the evidence adduced by Argentina to establish the self-judging character of Article XI exclusively pertains to the \"essential security interests\" element in that provision, and that there is no evidence showing that the US Government has considered self-judging the \"public order\" element or the reference to international peace and security contained in that same Article.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 827-850.\n\n575.\n\nMoreover, says the Claimant, in reality the \"essential security interest\" feature of Article XI is not self-judging. As a rule, treaty provisions are self-judging only if the States Parties to the treaty clearly say so, which is not the case here. Article XI is phrased in the same objective manner as the other provisions of the BIT, the review of which is the object of a compulsory adjudication procedure.\n\n576.\n\nThere is, according to the Claimant, no ambiguity in the text of Article XI. In the absence of any contrary indication, it is up to this Tribunal to review the existence of necessity under that Article, as it is within its competence to interpret the BIT by virtue of Article VII of that Treaty and the acceptance of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction by the Parties. Adjudication being the mode of review established by the BIT, the existence of a self-judging mechanism for a given provision must be attested to by explicit language, such as that found in Article XXI of the GATT. The difference of language in that instrument and in Article XI of the 1991 BIT is striking: \"action which *it* [the State] *considers* necessary\" in Article XXI of the GATT, as compared to \"measures necessary\" in Article XI of the BIT.\n\n577.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, a similar situation arose in the *Nicaragua* case, where the ICJ had to establish the meaning to be attributed to Article XXI(1) of the 1956 Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation (FCN) between Nicaragua and the US. The provision in question prescribed that \"the present Treaty shall not preclude the application of measures... (d)... necessary to protect essential security interests.\" The Court concluded that the reference to \"essential security interests\" in Article XXI(1) of the 1956 Treaty fell within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction as defined in the dispute settlement provision of Article XXIV of the same Treaty. The Court then compared the language of Article XXI(1) of the 1956 Treaty of FCN (\"necessary\") to that of Article XXI of the GATT (\"which it [the State] considers necessary\"). The latter provision, the Court explained, constituted an exception to the \"normal implementation\" of the General Agreement by allowing a Contracting Party to take action which it \"considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests\" in fields such as nuclear fission and arms, whereas Article XXI of the 1956 Treaty \"speaks simply of \u2018necessary\u2019 measures, not of those considered by a Party to be such.\"535\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n578.\n\nIs it believable, asks the Claimant, that the United States did not learn from the Id\u2019s judgment that self-judging provisions must be identified by explicit language? Could the US have thought it possible, a mere five years after the *Nicaragua* judgment, to make the reference to \"essential security interests\" in Article XI self-judging, without any explicit indication to that effect? According to the Claimant, it could not.\n\n579.\n\nTo this, the Claimant adds that in the wake of the *Nicaragua* case, the United States showed that it knew how to draft a self-judging clause when necessary. The Protocol appended to the BIT with Russia,536 negotiated in the same period as that with Argentina, states that \"the Parties confirm their mutual understanding that whether a measure is undertaken by a Party to protect its essential security interests is self-judging.\"537 No similar statement was made in connection with the 1991 Argentina-US BIT; and whereas the Protocol accompanying the latter does comment on Article XI, it says nothing about its alleged self-judging character, as it surely would have done had the Parties intended to give it such a character. This is especially so since, in subsequent BITs with El Salvador and Bahrain, the US saw to it that the \"which it *considers* necessary\" formula suggested in the *Nicaragua* judgment found its way into their texts.538\n\nTreaty Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment of 17 June 1992, International Legal Materials (I.L.M.), Vol. 31, 1992, p. 799.\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 809, point 8.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n580.\n\nTurning to the evidence of Argentina\u2019s legal experts, the Claimant asserts that not a single word uttered in the 1991 Treaty or any element in its context denotes any intent on the part of the United States or Argentina to confer self-judging status on Article XI of the Treaty.\n\n581.\n\nNext, the Claimant turns to unilateral assertions made by the United States, in connexion with other BITs, in the course of internal debates. Specifically it refers to exchanges between the US Department of State and the US Senate in 1988 and 1992 relating to the \"essential security interests\" clause in other BITs and in the 1992 Model Treaty.539 These exchanges, the Respondent argued, were evidence of the American attitude regarding the Model Treaty and suggested that the US position on Article XI of the 1991 BIT must have been the same during that period; and, since there is no contrary evidence, Argentina must have shared that attitude. According to the Claimant, there is no reason to have recourse to supplementary means of interpretation.\n\nArticle XIV(1) of the Treaty between the Government of the United State of America and the Government of the Republic of El Salvador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed at San Salvador on March 10, 1999; Article 14(1) of the Treaty between the Government of the United State of America and of the State of Bahrain concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed on September 29, 1999.\n\n582.\n\nIndeed, the text of Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT, read in its context and in light of the Treaty\u2019s purpose, is \"quite clear.\" In such situations, the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties does not authorise the use of supplementary means of interpretation. And, even if it did, and if Article 31(4) of the Vienna Convention540 were relied on to establish that the treaty terms in issue have a special meaning, inconsistent with that resulting from the application of Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, such a meaning would have to be established \"conclusively\" and by \"decisive\" proof.541 All the respondent State has to offer are internal statements which dwell on other treaties and do not support the idea that the US silently willed Article XI of the 1991 BIT to be self-judging. Moreover, says the Claimant, given Argentina\u2019s history of economic emergencies, it is unlikely that the US would have intended to clothe Article XI with self-judging character. Even if it had wished to do so, it would have had to inform Argentina and to obtain its consent.\n\nReply, \u00a7 847.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 839, referring to the Sofaer Opinion [note 500 below], \u00a7 31, citing Sir Humphrey Waldock\u2019s *Third Report on the Law of Treaties,* Yearbook of the International Law Commission 1964, Vol. II, p. 5. That provision, it will be recalled, specifies that \"[a] special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.\"\n\n583.\n\nIn other words, according to the Claimant, the Argentinian legal experts have failed to show the Parties\u2019 *mutual* intention to vest Article XI of the 1991 Treaty with self-judging character; nor can such an intention be derived from that instrument\u2019s context. According to Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the \"context\" includes, in addition to the text proper, the preamble and the annexes, (a) any agreement relating to the treaty \"made between all the Parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty,\" and (b) any instrument \"made by one or more Parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other Parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\" It follows from this that what the US may have intended with regard to Article XI, according to the Respondent, would not be relevant context. The status of relevant context would be limited to intentions *agreed upon* by the Parties, and there is no evidence of agreement on this point. Treaty interpretation does not consist in looking for the unilateral and silent wishes of a Party.\n\n584.\n\nIn the absence of relevant contextual elements, the interpreter should stick to the \"ordinary meaning\" of Article XI and to the Treaty\u2019s \"object and purpose.\"542 As pointed out already, the ordinary meaning of the relevant provision is that, like other Articles of the Treaty, it is of an objective rather than self-judging nature. This view is buttressed by the fact that the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose is to protect investments made by investors of one Party on the territory of the other. A self-judging interpretation of Article XI of the 1991 Treaty would enable Argentina to interfere almost limitlessly with US investments, subject only to a good faith standard.\n\n*Opinion of Abraham D. Sofaer* [hereinafter Sofaer Opinion] of 14 November 2006, \u00a7 31. Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 302.\n\n585.\n\nTo justify a departure from the above reasoning, Argentina would have to show that *both* Parties intended to give Article XI of the 1991 Treaty a special meaning under Article 31(4) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. There is no evidence, however, that they did. Consequently, the ordinary meaning of the text of the provision, viewed in the context of its object and purpose, must prevail.\n\n586.\n\nThe question of the self-judging nature of Article XI of the 1991 BIT came up, and was answered in the negative by the tribunal in *CMS.*543 Accordingly, that tribunal\u2019s task was not limited to establishing whether the plea of necessity had been invoked and whether the challenged measures were taken in good faith. The tribunal was called upon to examine whether, as a matter of substance, Argentina\u2019s recourse to Article XI was justified. The *LG&E* tribunal544 reached the same conclusion.\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7\u00a7 370, 373.\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7\u00a7 207-214.\n\n587.\n\nFinally, according to the Claimant, even if one were to decide otherwise, and if the self-judging power allegedly inherent in Article XI of the 1991 BIT were limited only by a good faith standard, Argentina\u2019s views could not prevail. Indeed, the continuous repudiation of the Claimant\u2019s rights, on the basis of an emergency that had long ceased to exist, is inconsistent with the good faith standard invoked by the respondent State.\n\n*(c) The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis*\n-----------------------------\n\n588.\n\nThe Tribunal will ascertain the meaning of Article XI of the 1991 Argentina-US BIT by applying Articles 31 and 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Before doing so, it wishes to point out, as the Claimant has done,545 that the evidence presented by the Respondent relates to a single element of Article XI, \"essential security interests.\" That Article, however, mentions two other possible justifications: the maintenance of public order and the fulfilment of the State\u2019s obligations regarding the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security. This could be taken to suggest that the self-judging character of Article XI is, at any rate, limited to \"essential security interests\" and cannot extend to the other elements, in particular the maintenance of public order. At first glance, the present case does not, however, seem to concern (external) security interests but possibly the maintenance of (internal) public order, which would not be a self-judging matter at all under Article XI of the BIT.\n\nSee *supra,* \u00a7 574.\n\n589.\n\nIt is not necessary to pursue this line of argument, however, since the Tribunal believes that Article XI contains no self-judging elements, as it will now show by examining the content of that provision in the light of the canons of treaty interpretation of Articles 31 and 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.\n\n590.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, pursuant to Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, any interpretation has to begin with an examination of the *terms* of the treaty taken in their ordinary meaning. The wording of the treaty is deemed to express the intention common to the Parties, and what the Parties effectively agreed to, even though a Party might have wished otherwise on one or another point. As long as such wishes are not expressed, the content of the treaty\u2019s provisions is paramount, and what is not there cannot be read into them. This prompts the further conclusion that in principle treaty rules must be regarded as being objective in nature, which means that, unless the contrary is specified, they are not self-judging: a State Party is not entitled to interpret unilaterally the terms of a treaty in an authoritative manner.\n\n591.\n\nIn principle, the ordinary meaning of a treaty provision is that given to its terms at the time of its conclusion, in the present case in 1991, as was pointed out by the tribunal in *LG&E,546* Changes occurring elsewhere, at a later stage, for instance when other, similar treaties are being negotiated or when a model treaty is being submitted to a national authority for approval, even if they happened before the treaty to be interpreted is ratified or comes into force, are irrelevant for establishing the meaning to be given to it. This means that Argentina cannot rely on the BITs negotiated after 1991 or on the 1992 Model Treaty.\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7122.\n\n592.\n\nTreaty provisions allowing for exceptions to the rights guaranteed in the same treaty must be attributed the ordinary meaning resulting from their text, without reading self-judging clauses into them, especially when the treaty contains compromissory clauses, as is the case here. This clearly results from the case-law and from international practice.\n\n593.\n\nIn this respect, *Nicaragua* is evidently the leading case, where the ICJ was confronted with an \"essential security interests\" clause found in Article XXI of the 1956 Nicaragua-US Treaty of FCN (\"the present Treaty shall not preclude the application of measures... (d)... necessary to protect its essential security interests\"). That same Treaty also contained a compromissory clause placing disputes pertaining to the interpretation and application of its provisions under the ICJ\u2019s jurisdiction. The ICJ thought that the above clause was not self-judging and found that it had jurisdiction to determine whether the essential security interests clause was applicable - a question it answered in the negative. In this precedent, the Court establishes that, in the absence of qualifying language, the text of the relevant provision must be interpreted as it is, according to its ordinary meaning. To buttress its conclusion, the ICJ cites, *a contrario,* Article XXI of the GATT, which does contain qualifying language (\"Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed... (b) To prevent any Contracting Party from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests\").\n\n594.\n\nThe above precedent is of particular relevance in the present instance because it relates to a treaty which, though not a BIT, also defines and protects rights of individuals of one Party on the territory of the other and because the 1991 Argentina-US BIT, like the Nicaragua-US Treaty of FCN, contains a compromissory clause. The *Nicaragua* judgment was rendered in 1986; the Argentina-US BIT was concluded in 1991, barely five years later. It is most unlikely that within this short time-span the US could have forgotten the lesson of *Nicaragua* which amounted to saying that if one wishes a treaty clause to be self-judging, one has to say so and to obtain the other Party\u2019s assent. The conclusion emerging from these elements is that at the relevant time, the US did not seek to attribute self-judging character to Article XI of the 1991 BIT.\n\n595.\n\nThis conclusion is supported by two decisions of ICSID tribunals bearing on the very same provision, *i.e.* Article XI of the 1991 BIT. In *CMS,* the tribunal said:\n\n\"The Tribunal is convinced that when States intend to create for themselves a right to determine unilaterally the legitimacy of extraordinary measures importing [sic] non-compliance with obligations assumed in a treaty, they do so expressly.\"547\n\nThe arbitral tribunal then explained that if measures taken by Argentina are considered justified by that State under Article XI of the BIT, it is not up to Argentina to determine unilaterally that such justification is legitimate. It is not sufficient, in other words, merely to invoke Article XI and to assert that the State\u2019s measures were taken in good faith. It is also necessary to show that those measures were effectively covered by the language of Article XI.548\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 370.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 367-374.\n\n596.\n\nThe above views were shared by the arbitral tribunal in *LG&E.* In its decision, that tribunal said:\n\n\"Based on the evidence before the Tribunal regarding the understanding of the Parties in 1991 at the time the Treaty was signed, the Tribunal decides and concludes that the provision [Article XI] is not self-judging.\"549\n\nThe passage just cited is of particular interest because it emphasises what has been said earlier,550 namely, that what matters is the Parties\u2019 common intention at the time of signature in 1991, when negotiations had been concluded, rather than subsequent events.\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7 212.\n\nSee *supra* \u00a7 564.\n\n597.\n\nThe case-law reported above is particularly persuasive because the US has been one of the champions of self-judging clauses, a device which it has used at least since the end of World War II, witness the so-called Connally amendment embodied in the declaration made by the United States on 26 August 1946 under Article 36(2) of the Statute of the ICJ. In that declaration,551 the US accepted the Court\u2019s compulsory jurisdiction, except for matters falling within its domestic jurisdiction \"as determined by the United States.\" Surely the inclusion of that clause - which only ceased to exist when the US withdrew its declaration in 1985 - shows that the possibility of introducing a self-judging mechanism, coupled with the necessity of doing so explicitly, had been known to the US for many years and that the *Nicaragua* judgment did not, on this point, come as a surprise, even though, in that case, the ICJ did examine whether, implicitly, Article XXI of the Nicaragua-US Treaty of FCN of 1956 had a self-judging character.\n\nSee ICJ Yearbook 1985-1986, p. 60.\n\n598.\n\nArticle 15 of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights552 allows States Parties, in time of war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation, to derogate from their obligations under the Convention - except regarding Articles 2, 3, 4(1) and 7 - to the extent strictly required by the exigencies of the situation, provided that such derogations are not inconsistent with the Parties\u2019 other obligations under international law. A similar clause can be found in Article 27 of the 1969 American Human Rights Convention.553 The case-law of the European Court of Human Rights shows that these provisions, despite their being emergency clauses, are far from being self-judging. In concrete cases brought before the Court and involving derogations formulated on the basis of those provisions, it is the European Court which determines whether they meet the conditions provided for in Article 15.554\n\nCouncil of Europe, *Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms as amended by Protocol No. 11, with Protocols Nos. 1, 4, 6, 7, 12 and 13,* available at: http://www.echr.coe.int/nr/rdonlyres/d5cc24a7-dcl3-4318-b457-5c9014916d7a/0/englishanglais.pdf\n\nOrganization of American States (OAS), *American Convention on Human Rights, \"Pact of San Jose, Costa Rica, \"* available at: http://www.oas.org/Juridico/english/treaties/b-32.html.\n\nHuman Rights in International Law.

That notion is defined by Article 31(2) of the Convention as including, besides the body of the treaty, its preamble and its annexes - the \"narrow\" context - as well as (a) \"agreements\" relating to the treaty made by all its Parties in connection with its conclusion; and (b) instruments \"made\" by one or several Parties to the treaty and accepted as such by the other Parties to the treaty. These agreements and instruments form what may be called the \"wide\" context.\n\n600.\n\nSo far as the 1991 BIT between Argentina and the US is concerned, it may be argued that its preamble and the body of the text show that this Treaty aims at creating a stable and prosperous investment climate in both countries. That aim could not be attained if the exceptions allowed by Article XI were considered self-judging. Remaining within the \"wide\" context, one may note that there are no \"agreements\" relating to the treaty made by all Parties in connection with its conclusion (Article 3l(2)(a) of the Vienna Convention), nor are there any \"instruments\" emanating from one or more Treaty Parties, accepted by the other Parties and \"connected with the conclusion of the treaty.\" Whatever may be and has been invoked by the respondent State - other BITs, the 1992 Model Treaty, etc. - is certainly not \"connected *with the conclusion\"* of the 1991 BIT between Argentina and the US.\n\n601.\n\nArticle 31(3) of the Vienna Convention does, however, mention elements *not connected with the conclusion of the treaty* and subsequent to the latter, *i.e.* (a) subsequent agreements between the Parties to the treaty regarding the interpretation or application of the latter\u2019s provisions; (b) any subsequent practice which establishes the agreement of the Parties regarding its interpretation; and (c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Parties.\n\n602.\n\nWhile the above-mentioned sub-paragraphs (a) and (c) of Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention do not appear relevant here, a closer look at sub-paragraph (b) - any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation - seems necessary. Indeed, it has been contended by Argentina that the views of the US on self-judging provisions of BITs and other agreements changed in 1992 and that Argentina accepted the change, the aggregate amounting to a subsequent agreement on the interpretation of Article XI of the 1991 Argentina-US BIT. There is, to be sure, a \"subsequent practice\" consisting in a changed negotiating position; Argentina did not, however, have to approve or disapprove it since it did not relate to the interpretation of the 1991 BIT but to the American attitude in future negotiations with other States.\n\n603.\n\nEven if this were not so, internal exchanges between the organs of one Contracting State, coupled with the silence of the other State, are not sufficient to produce an agreed practice of interpretation; at least *some* communication must be shown to have occurred, which is not the case here. According to the respondent State, the Argentinian \"agreement\" consists, *inter alia,* in Argentina\u2019s \"awareness\" that in its argument before the ICJ in the *Nicaragua* case, the US had alleged that the exception embodied in Article XXI of the US-Nicaragua Treaty of FCN - essential security interests - was self-judging and that, this being the case, the idea of self-judgment was also implicit in Article XI of the 1991 BIT between Argentina and the US. This line of argument seems far-fetched, and there is no evidence to support it. The provision in issue in the *Nicaragua* case defined the ICJ\u2019s jurisdiction in matters covered by the treaty and an exception thereto, related to \"essential security interests,\" while the 1991 Argentina-US BIT pertains to substantive rights of individuals and companies and, moreover, contains not one but three exceptions in its Article XI (essential security interests, performance of obligations for the maintenance or restoration of international peace and security, maintenance of public order). Furthermore, the argument wholly overlooks the judgment in the case, which refuses self-judging character to a provision not unlike Article XI of the 1991 BIT. In reality, the signal received by both Argentina and the US in *Nicaragua* is likely to have been that no provision is self-judging unless the Parties clearly say so, which is not the case for Article XI. Finally, the \"awareness\" of Argentina seems to be of recent origin, having made its first appearance in the written pleadings on the substance of the present dispute.\n\n604.\n\nA further element of interpretation to be examined is the *object and purpose* of the treaty (Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention of the Law of Treaties). The purpose of BITs such as the present one is to establish a climate inducing investors of one State to invest on the territory of the other by creating, for both sides, reasonable conditions for the making of investments and for their protection. The three elements embodied in Article XI of the 1991 Argentina-US BIT - and in similar provisions of other BITs - are part and parcel of the balance that must exist in such treaties. That balance would be disrupted if the legality of invoking one of the three elements present in Article XI were to be interpreted unilaterally by the State on whose territory the investments have been made. One could of course reply that the balance is restored by the fact that the recognition of a power of self-judgment for one Party entails the same power for the other Party on the basis of reciprocity. Would this re-adjust the balance? Not quite. BITs are about funds invested by foreign nationals, not about direct relationships between States. Therefore, self-judging exceptions such as that allegedly introduced into Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT by tacit consent would give extremely large powers to the State on whose territory the investment was made - the reference to good faith is of little help - and expose the investors to large risks.\n\n605.\n\nThe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties however departs from the rules in paragraphs 1 to 3 of Article 31 by stating, in its paragraph 4, that \"[a] *special meaning* shall be given to a term if it is established that the Parties so intended.\" Article 31(4) must be read in conjunction with Article 32 of the Convention according to which recourse may be had to \"supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion,\" if the interpretation obtained from the elements listed in Article 31: (a) leaves the meaning of a provision ambiguous or obscure; or (b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. Article 32 of the Vienna Convention adds that the supplementary means of interpretation mentioned by it - preparatory work, circumstances surrounding the treaty\u2019s conclusion - may also be used to confirm an interpretation already obtained *via* the elements listed in Article 31, which carries the implication that said supplementary means may equally be used to invalidate that interpretation.\n\n606.\n\nTo sum up, supplementary means of interpretation may be used:\n\n- to establish a special meaning;\n\n- to confirm or invalidate interpretations obtained by applying the elements listed in Article 31;\n\n- to correct results so obtained if they are ambiguous, obscure, manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n607.\n\nDespite opinions according to which the supplementary means of interpretation cannot normally be resorted to - and this also seems to be the Claimant\u2019s view - the above explanations show that in practice it is always possible to have recourse to them.\n\n608.\n\nThe next question to consider is thus whether the results of the interpretation of Article XI of the 1991 BIT obtained by the application of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention are confirmed or invalidated if one turns to the supplementary means of interpretation mentioned in Article 32 of that Convention.\n\n609.\n\nThe Tribunal is not aware of any element suggesting that the interpretation of Article XI based on Article 31(1) to (3) of the Vienna Convention is wrong, ambiguous, obscure, manifestly unreasonable or absurd. On the contrary, insofar as any of the elements mentioned in Article 32 of the Convention can be identified, their use would confirm or at least not contradict the conclusion previously reached, *i.e.* that Article XI does not have self-judging character. Indeed, no *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* to the contrary have been identified -declarations made in connection with other BITs or the 1992 Model Treaty do not qualify as preparatory work related to the present Treaty - and the same is true for the circumstances surrounding the latter\u2019s conclusion. The ICJ\u2019s Judgment in the *Nicaragua* case makes it clear that, to render a treaty provision self-judging, the intention to do so must be explicitly stated - which it was not -particularly where the treaty is equipped with a dispute-settlement mechanism, as is the case of the 1991 BIT.\n\n610.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal considers that Article XI of the 1991 Argentina-US BIT is not self-judging. In other words, it is the duty of the Tribunal first to interpret Article XI and then to decide whether or not the situation that prevailed in Argentina at the time of the impugned measures can be subsumed under the exceptions listed in that Article.\n\n*(ii) The Interpretation of Article XI: a General Approach*\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n611.\n\nAs far as the interpretation of Article XI is concerned, the Tribunal wishes to emphasise that a state of emergency can be of an economic nature, as stated by other ICSID tribunals in the Argentinian cases.\n\n612.\n\nIt will also be noted that no compensation must be awarded for damage suffered during the period of emergency, as the BIT does not apply in such a period, except if the State has substantially contributed to create it, while damages might be awarded for measures taken during the state of emergency and not cancelled when the state of emergency has ceased to exist.\n\n*(iii) The Interpretation of Article XI: Admissibility of the State\u2019s Defence under Article XI*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n613.\n\nAs any other provision of the BIT, Article XI is interpreted on the basis of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Further, as also recognised in *Continental,555* concepts used in Article 25 of the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts556 \"assist in the interpretation of Article XI itself.\" When interpreted in light of the above principles, the requirement under Article XI that the measures must be \"necessary\" presupposes that the State has not contributed, by acts or omissions, to creating the situation which it relies on when claiming the lawfulness of its measures.\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 168.\n\nILC Articles, *supra* note 40.\n\n614.\n\nArticle 31 (3) of the Vienna Convention provides that the terms of a treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to those terms in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty. As indicated in the preamble, the object and purpose of the BIT between Argentina and the US is to promote and improve the investment climate between the Contracting Parties, notably by establishing some stability regarding the status of investments.\n\n615.\n\nThat such stability cannot be total is stating the obvious. The world changes and so does the environment for foreign investment, especially when extraordinary circumstances appear. The host State is generally not responsible for the consequences of a state of emergency. It will be responsible, however, for the consequences of a state of emergency if it has significantly contributed to that situation. Holding otherwise would mean that Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT is not being interpreted in the light of its object and purpose, for that Treaty cannot possibly allow for the possibility that if the host State itself has caused or significantly helped to cause, intentionally or by omission, the situation and the consequences complained of, that State may shirk its obligations under the BIT by invoking Article XI. This conclusion is supported by other elements.\n\n616.\n\nAccording to Article 31 (3) of the Vienna Convention, the interpretation of treaty rules should take into account, *inter alia,* \"any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the Parties.\" This approach to the interpretation of a treaty has also been adopted by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in *the Amoco* case, where it stated:\n\n\"As a lex specialis in the relations between the two countries, the Treaty supersedes the lex generalis, namely customary international law. This does not mean, however, that the latter is irrelevant in the instant Case. On the contrary, the rules of customary international law may be useful in order to fill in possible lacunae of the Treaty, to ascertain the meaning of undefined terms in its text or, more generally, to aid interpretation and implementation of its provisions.\"557\n\n*Amoco v. Iran,* Case No. 56, Chamber 3, Award No. 310-65-3 of 14 July 1987, \u00a7 112.\n\n617.\n\nSurely one of those general rules of international law is that codified in Article 25(2) of the ILC\u2019s Articles on the Responsibility of States, which provides, in part, that: \"In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:... (b) The State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\"\n\n618.\n\nIn its commentary on the above provision, the Commission points out, however, that \"the [State\u2019s] contribution to the situation of necessity must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral.\"558 That this rule, as framed by the Commission, forms part of general international law is shown by the case-law of the International Court of Justice. Indeed, in its Judgment in the case of the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project,* the Court held that:\n\n\"Hungary would not have been permitted to rely on that state of necessity in order to justify its failure to comply with its treaty obligations, as it had helped, by act or omission, to bring it about.\"559\n\nJames Crawford, *The International Law\u2019s Commission Articles on State Responsibility - Introduction, Text and Commentaries,* Cambridge, Cambridge University Press 2002, p. 185.\n\n*Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project* [hereinafter *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros],* (Hungary v. Slovakia), Judgment of 25 September 1997, ICJ Reports 1997, p. 43, \u00a7 57 *in fine.*\n\n619.\n\nThe rule in question has also been applied in interpreting Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT. As mentioned by the arbitral tribunal in *LG&E,*\n\n\"[i]t seems logical that if the State has contributed to cause the emergency, it should be prevented from invoking the state of necessity. If there is fault by the State, the exception disappears, since in such case the causal relationship between the State\u2019s act and the damage is produced.\"560\n\nAnd in *Continental,* the arbitral tribunal said, in connection with \"essential security interests,\" which, under Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT, allows recourse to that Article, that\n\n\"... if a Contracting Party to the BIT has contributed to endangering its essential security interest, for the protection of which it has then adopted the challenged measures, those measures may fail to qualify as \u2018necessary\u2019 under Article XI, since that Party could have pursued some other policy that would have rendered them unnecessary.\"561\n\n*LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7 256. The award refers to the state of necessity under Article 25 of the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles, but its finding reflects a principle of general application.\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 234.\n\n620.\n\nThe general applicability of the rule barring the invocation of necessity when the State concerned itself has created that necessity or has significantly contributed to it is also supported by other provisions of the ILC Articles dealing with the preclusion of wrongfulness. Thus, Article 23 (1) of that text, dealing with *force majeure,* provides that to invoke the latter, the event creating the necessity must have been \"beyond the control of the State.\" Article 24(2)(a), for its part, relates to \"distress\" and rules out the preclusion of wrongfulness \"if the State has contributed to the situation of distress.\" Thus, the rule expressed in Article 25(2)(b) of the ILC Articles concerns but one type of situation where \"contributory behaviour\" on the part of the State involved precludes reference to necessity.\n\n621.\n\nSo far, this Tribunal has limited itself to examining the question of whether the above-mentioned precept is a rule of general international law, applicable between the Parties to the BIT and, hence, a rule which may be used to interpret Article XI of the latter. It has reached an affirmative conclusion on this point. One could also ask whether the rule exists as a \"general principle of law recognised by civilised nations\" in the sense of Article 38 (1) (c) of the Statute of the ICJ.\n\n622.\n\nVolumes have been written on the subject of \"general principles.\" Some authors consider that the latter must meet requirements similar to those applied to customary rules (general practice and *opinio juris),* which suggests that in reality this category is not an autonomous one.562 The mainstream view seems to be, however, that \"general principles\" are rules largely applied *in foro domestico,* in private or public, substantive or procedural matters, provided that, after adaptation, they are suitable for application on the level of public international law.563\n\nThus, B. Conforti, *Diritto internazionale. Manuali per l\u2019Universit\u00e0 Napoli,* Editoriale Scientifica, 2006, writes on pp. 40-41: \"A nostro awiso due condizioni o requisiti debbono sussistere perch\u00e9 principi statali possano essere applicati a titolo di principi generali di diritto internazionale. Occorre anzitutto che essi esistano e siano uniformemente applicati nella *pi\u00f9 gran parte* degli Stati; in secondo luogo, e questa \u00e8 la condizione pi\u00f9 caratterizzante, occorre che essi siano sentiti come obbligatori o necessari anche dal punto di vista del diritto internazionale, che essi cio\u00e8 perseguano dei valori e impongano dei comportamenti che gli Stati considerino come perseguid ed imposti o almeno necessari anche sul piano internazionale.\" Emphasis in the text. \"There are two conditions for principles of domestic law to be applied as general principles of international law. It is first of all necessary that they exist and are uniformly applied in the *great majority* of States; secondly, and this is the most characterising condition, they must be perceived as obligatory or necessary also from the point of view of international law, *i.e.* as upholding values and prescribing behaviour that States consider as pursued or prescribed or at least as necessary also at the international level.\" (Translation by the Tribunal.)\n\nOn this matter, and on the distinction between \"general principles of law recognised by civilised nations\" and \"general principles of international law,\" see, e.g., H. Mosier, \"General Principles of Law,\" in: R. Bernhardt (ed.), *Encyclopedia of Public International Law,* Vol. II (E-I), Amsterdam, 1995, North-Holland, pp. 511-527.\n\n623.\n\nThat there is a general principle on the preclusion of wrongfulness in certain situations can hardly be doubted, as is confirmed by the UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial Contracts, a sort of international restatement of the law of contracts reflecting rules and principles applied by the majority of national legal systems.564 Article 6(2)(2) of these Principles, dealing with \"hardship,\" provides that events causing hardship must be \"beyond the control of the disadvantaged Party.\" Article 7(1)(6) on \"exemption clauses\" prescribes that a party may not claim exemption from liability \"if it would be grossly unfair to [exempt it] having regard to the purpose of the contract.\" Finally, Article 7(1)(7), relating to \"force majeure\" *(vis maior)* excuses nonperformance of a contract\n\n\"... if that Party proves that the non-performance was due to an impediment beyond its control and that it could not reasonably be expected to have taken the impediment into account at the time of the conclusion of the contract or to have avoided or overcome its consequences.\"565\n\nExemption from liability for non-performance or other forms of relief are therefore excluded under the UNIDROIT Principles if the Party claiming it was \"in control\" of the situation or if it would be \"grossly unfair\" to allow for such exemption.\n\nM. J. Bonell, An International Restatement of Contract Law - The UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts, Transnational Publishers, Inc., Irvington, NY, 3rd ed. 2005.\n\nInternational Institute for the Unification of Private Law (UNIDROIT), *UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contract 2004,* available at: http://www.unidroit.org/english/principles/contracts/principles2004/integralversionprinciples2004-e.pdf.\n\n624.\n\nIt follows from the above that: (i) there is a rule of general international law which provides that necessity may not be invoked as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if the State concerned has significantly contributed to creating that necessity; (ii) there also seems to be a general principle of law recognised by civilised nations that necessity cannot be recognised if a Party to a contract has contributed to it. This means that the rule or principle in question may be used, under Article 31 (3) of the Vienna Convention, to ascertain the meaning of Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT. Accordingly, that Article may be taken to mean that necessity cannot be invoked by a Party having itself created such necessity or having substantially contributed to it.\n\n625.\n\nBefore examining whether Argentina has contributed to creating the situation on which it relies under Article XI, it is necessary to determine which Party bears the burden of proof in that regard. The Respondent appears to accept that it has to prove the defence it advances, namely, its entitlement to relying on \"necessity\", since in its view the events of 2001 required emergency measures.566 The Claimant concurs but suggests that it is up to Argentina also \"to demonstrate that the alleged economic situation was not self-inflicted.\"567\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 106-139 (the issue of Argentina\u2019s contribution to the crisis is examined in \u00a7\u00a7 755-761).\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 687 and 707 (including footnote 1103).\n\n626.\n\nIt is the Tribunal\u2019s view that the existence of the conditions for the application of Article XI, *i.e.* whether: (a) public order or essential security interests are at stake, and (b) whether the measures are necessary to maintain the former or protect the latter, is to be proved by the Respondent since it relies on such facts to preclude a finding that the measures breached the BIT.568 Conversely, it is incumbent upon the Claimant to prove Respondent\u2019s contribution to bringing about the necessity of the measures since it relies on such a contribution as a defence against the application of Article XI.569\n\nBing Cheng, *General Principles of Law Applied by International Courts and Tribunals,* Cambridge, Cambridge University Press 2006, \u00a7 987, p. 334: \"the burden of proof rests upon the party alleging the fact....\"\n\nIn *LG&E,* the tribunal held that the burden of proof was on the Claimants: \"Claimants have not proved that Argentina has contributed to cause the severe crisis faced by the country.\" *LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7 256.\n\n*(iv) The Application of Article XI: The Parties\u2019 Positions on the State\u2019s* *Contribution to the Economie Crisis of 2001*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Claimant\u2019s Position*\n-----------------------------\n\n627.\n\nThe Claimant contends that \"Argentina\u2019s economic \u2018emergency\u2019 of 2001 was almost entirely a result of the economic policy failures of the Argentine authorities.\"570 In order to substantiate its position, the Claimant has produced a report by a macroeconomic expert, Professor Sebastian Edwards, dated 26 November 2006 and accompanied by many exhibits (\"Edwards Report\"). The Tribunal will therefore examine the Edwards Report as detailing the Claimant\u2019s position on the issue.\n\nReply, \u00a7 679. Claimant\u2019s Memorial addresses this issue by pointing to the requirement, under Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles, that \"... the GOA did not contribute to the situation of alleged necessity,\" Memorial, \u00a7 569, relying on the *Gabcikovo-Nagymaros* Judgment, *supra* note 559, Memorial, \u00a7 574.\n\n628.\n\nThe Edwards Report asserts that \"[t]he Argentine economic crisis of 2001-2002 was primarily self-induced\"571 and explains that a significant portion of Argentina\u2019s responsibility for its economic and currency crisis of 2001 is related to the failure to implement structural reforms that the currency board system *(i.e.* the currency system that pegged the Argentinian Peso to the US dollar) needed in order to succeed. For Argentina\u2019s currency board to work properly and remain viable over the medium or long term, there were at least four broad categories of supporting measures that Argentina needed to implement:\n\n\u2022 Achieve and maintain fiscal discipline. In the absence of balanced fiscal accounts, a currency board would not be credible, and the public would end up withdrawing deposits from the banking sector. This would restrict liquidity and result in higher interest rates, which in turn would provoke a decline of investment and economic growth. Furthermore, during economic expansion, the public sector should run surpluses and build up fiscal reserves in order to provide a cushion during economic downturns and to enable the economy to face adverse international shocks.572\n\n\u2022 Achieve and maintain labour market flexibility. In the absence of exchange rate flexibility, an economy needs labour market flexibility in order to accommodate external shocks. Competitiveness must therefore be achieved through a reduction in labour costs. However, if the labour market is heavily regulated and inflexible, labour costs will not decline and competitiveness will not improve; this will result in a higher rate of unemployment.573\n\n\u2022 Open its economy by reducing barriers to foreign trade. If a currency board economy has a low degree of openness to international trade, even a modest external shock will result in a large decline in growth, since the GDP is forced to contract significantly in order to bring about a modest reduction in imports. However, in a currency board economy that is open to trade, even a large external shock will have a minor impact on economic activity.574\n\n\u2022 Show firm governmental resolve to maintain the currency peg. If the credibility of the government\u2019s resolve to maintain the currency peg wanes, the public will begin to withdraw deposits. As deposits decline, bank liquidity diminishes, which leads to higher interest rates and a decline in economic activity. As the economy slumps, credibility and deposits are likely to decline further.575\n\n*Expert Report of Professor Sebastian Edwards* [hereinafter Edwards Report] of 26 November 2006, \u00a7 5 and \u00a7 4L Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 212.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 37.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n629.\n\nRecommendations to that effect were made repeatedly by the IBRD, the IMF and others. In short, the GOA knew precisely what it needed to do to make the currency board work. It also fully understood that if it did not implement the required reforms, Argentina\u2019s economy would remain highly vulnerable, and a future currency crisis would be inevitable.576 Despite this knowledge, Argentina\u2019s leaders never had the political will to implement the measures required. Fiscal responsibility, labour market flexibility and an open-trade policy each entailed a political price, and the Government simply never mustered the political will to pay that price. In the fiscal arena, Argentina ran large and increasing deficits throughout the 1992-2000 period. During many of the \"good years,\" GDP growth was strong, and Argentina could have run surpluses to build up reserves as a cushion for a future economic downturn.577\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 38-39.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 48-49.\n\n630.\n\nAlthough the GOA could have implemented a variety of measures during the 90s to strengthen fiscal discipline, one of the most obvious and significant steps that it could have taken, according to the Claimant - but did not take - was to reduce provincial spending. Doing so would have required the Government fundamentally to reform Argentina\u2019s \"Co-Participation Law\" of 1988, which created strong incentives for fiscal indiscipline on the part of the country\u2019s provincial governments. The Co-Participation Law provided for large transfers of tax revenues from the Federal Government to the provincial governments, and these transfers accounted for a significant portion of Argentina\u2019s total public sector expenditure.578\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 52-53.\n\n631.\n\nBy 2001, Argentina\u2019s economic condition had further declined, and the pressures on the currency board had grown. Nevertheless, Argentina still took no serious action to implement the structural reforms so desperately needed by its economy, such as the fundamental reform of the highly destabilising and perverse Co-Participation Law, the curtailment of aggressive public sector spending, the reform of the onerous and highly inefficient system of union-run social services *('obras sociales\u2019)* and the elimination of protectionist trade practices.579 Instead, the GOA embarked on a series of short-term manoeuvres such as the \"Zero-Deficit\" policy based on measures (such as the reduction in Government employees\u2019 salaries and pensions) that further reduced credibility, signalling a lack of commitment to the Convertibility Law.580\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 65.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a767 and 69.\n\n632.\n\nOne of the most important policy mistakes of 2001, according to the Claimant, was postponing fiscal and provincial adjustments until after the elections of October 2001. The Minister of the Economy, Domingo Cavallo, actively discussed the serious need to reform the Co-Participation Law and reduce provincial spending. That discussion, however, was put off until mid-October 2001. The governing coalition was concerned about the congressional elections of October 14, 2001, and provincial governors were spending heavily in support of their senatorial candidates. The day after the elections, Minister Cavallo proposed to reform the Co-Participation Law, to reduce the size of the public sector and to restructure provincial debts, but once again politics prevailed and the governors rejected the proposals. As a result of \"quick-fix\" measures taken in 2001, as well as the almost massive issuance of *\"quasi-monies '* by the provinces and the refusal to reform the Co-Participation Law, confidence in the currency board and the stability of the banking system and of the currency board regime was increasingly at risk. The Argentinian public as well as the international financial community drew the obvious conclusion that Argentina\u2019s political leadership would not undertake the serious reforms required by the currency board. In November 2001, Standard & Poor lowered Argentina\u2019s long-term sovereign rating to \"selective default.\"581\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 70-72.\n\n633.\n\nContrary to what was suggested by the GOA and its expert, Professor Roubini, external shocks played a limited role in Argentina\u2019s economic crisis. However, misguided internal policies significantly *amplified*582 the effects of external shocks on the Argentine economy. Many Latin-American countries experienced more severe external shocks than Argentina, yet did not suffer a major crisis. Moreover, most of the external shocks affecting Argentina (such as the decline in export prices, the increase of international interest rates and the growing strength of the U.S. dollar in international markets) were temporary phenomena that reversed in late 2001.583\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 170.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 12 and 172.\n\n*(b) The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n634.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent, referring to Article 25 of the ILC Articles, denies having contributed to the occurrence of the state of necessity. Argentina relies on the requirement that any such contribution must be sufficiently substantial, not merely incidental or peripheral, to disregard the existence of a state of necessity.584\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 755-756.\n\n635.\n\nIf the requirement of a lack of contribution were to be interpreted in such an extensive way, it would be impossible for a State to invoke the state of necessity as a circumstance precluding wrongfulness.585 Quoting its experts, the Respondent suggests that \"it strains credulity to think that Argentina intentionally sought to cause the financial collapse of 2000-2001.\"586 Still relying on its experts, the GOA points to the considerable bearing that external factors, such as IMF policies and the state of the global economy, had on Argentinian economic policies.587\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 563.\n\nSlaughter/Burke-White Report, *supra* note 523, \u00a7 102 (quoted in Counter-Memorial, \u00a7 757).\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 758-760.\n\n636.\n\nRegarding the defence of necessity, in the Rejoinder, Argentina deals separately with Article XI and Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles. However, the Respondent refers essentially to Article 25 when dealing with the issue of \"noncontribution.\"588 It addresses issues raised by the Edwards Report by invoking essentially the Report by Professor Nouriel Roubini of 24 August 2006 presented with the Counter-Memorial (the \"Roubini Report\"), and the Report by Professors Robert Frenkel and Mario Damill, undated but appended to the Rejoinder (the \"Frenkel-Damill Report\"). The Roubini Report pre-dates the Edwards Report but deals with some of the issues considered by the latter. The Frenkel-Damill Report is in part a response to the Edwards Report, as evidenced by its title: \"Diagnosis of the Crisis and Measures of the Argentine Government and Reply to Professor Sebastian Edwards\u2019 Report.\" These Reports will be analysed hereafter to the extent to which they deal with Argentina\u2019s contribution to the crisis.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 559-565.\n\n637.\n\nAccording to Professor Roubini, Argentina\u2019s fixed-exchange-rate regime was not sustainable as it was inconsistent with economic and macroeconomic fundamentals, and was worsened by domestic and external shocks. When this regime became unsustainable, there was a run on the reserves of the Central Bank; and when these reserves were exhausted, there would be a currency collapse and a depreciation/devaluation of the currency. After this occurred in Argentina, the only economically sensible option was to abandon convertibility, to repeal the currency board and to move to a floating exchange rate, the experience of Argentina being the rule rather than an exception among emerging market economies.589\n\nRoubini Report, *supra* note 252, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 13 and 15.\n\n638.\n\nThe following macroeconomic factors made it unavoidable for Argentina to abandon the currency board regime:\n\n\"i) a series of shocks to the economy; ii) large fiscal imbalances and debt accumulation; iii) structural vulnerabilities; iv) currency overvaluation and large and eventually unsustainable external imbalances and loss of competitiveness.\"590\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 17.\n\n639.\n\nSeveral external shocks were identified by Professor Roubini, including (but not limited to): a \"sudden stop\" of capital inflows in 1998 and 1999, making the cost of borrowing in the international market higher and the quantity of funds more limited; the sharp devaluation of the Brazilian currency; the general strengthening of the US dollar against the euro and other major currencies between 1998 and 2001, causing Argentina to lose competitiveness in European and other markets since the peso was tied to the appreciated US dollar. The combination of these shocks slowed GDP growth in the second half of 1998 and produced an increasing recession until 2001.591\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 18-19.\n\n640.\n\nFiscal deficits and debt accumulation worsened after 1998 because of a fall in revenues, a cyclical increase in spending and the sharp increase in interest payments resulting from the sharp increase in the foreign debt sovereign spread and domestic interest rates. Fiscal deficit and debt accumulation were exacerbated by an increase in nominal and interest rates for Argentina after 1998, due partly to the worsening domestic fiscal position and the successive Governments\u2019 inability to achieve sufficient surpluses.592\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 21-22.\n\n641.\n\nOther structural vulnerabilities included: the reduced openness of the economy due to a long history of inward-oriented trade policies; labour market rigidities; a very large external debt-to-exports ratio; and an enormous currency mismatch due to the fact that almost the entire domestic and external Government debt was denominated in dollars.593\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 24.\n\n642.\n\nAccording to Professor Roubini, these factors made the fixed exchange rate regime inconsistent with economic fundamentals and led to a currency crisis. Argentina\u2019s macroeconomic hands were tied since it could not adjust its currency peg without bankrupting many firms while its high existing debt prevented it from running a counter-cyclical fiscal policy.594\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 30-31.\n\n643.\n\nIn their rebuttal of the Edwards Report, Professors Frenkel and Damill contend, first, that since macroeconomics are not an experimental science, the views put forward by Professor Edwards are only his own.595 They are of the opinion that external factors were the proximate cause of the crisis (the decline of export prices, the US dollar revaluation, the massive drop in the prices of emerging market bonds, the subsequent rise of country risk premium and interest rates after the Eastern Asia crisis, and the devaluation of the Brazilian currency). Regarding individual issues raised by the Edwards Report, the following is noted by Damill and Frenkel:\n\n(a) a high level of wages, reducing the competitiveness of the economy: reforms were implemented in the 1990\u2019s which, according to Professor Edwards, were not sufficient to solve the problem; to reach the required labour market flexibility, however, would have meant an increase in the unemployment rate, thus worsening the problem;596\n\n(b) as to the measures which, according to Professor Edwards, should have been adopted in 2001 to avoid the devaluation, the default by the public debt and the pesification, they were: (i) exchanging bonds for bonds with longer maturity and, possibly, a lower interest rate: this took place in June 2001 through a voluntary debt swap (megaswap), but with no result;597 (ii) \"dollarisation\": this was not feasible since the Central Bank would not have had available the amount of liquid US dollars needed to implement the measure; furthermore, it would have meant a dollarisation by the GOA of private contracts in order to change their currency from Argentine Pesos to US dollars, with the same effects that were complained of for the pesification, without the withdrawal of bank deposits being prevented.598\n\nMario Damill and Roberto Frenkel, *Diagnosis of the Crisis and Measures of the Argentine government, and reply to Professor Sebastian Edwards Report* [hereinafter Damill and Frenkel Report], \u00a7 171. Annex to the Rejoinder.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 179-181.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 186-187.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 188-191.\n\n644.\n\nRegarding the fiscal evolution, Professor Edwards selectively quoted figures from secondary sources.599 According to Professor Edwards\u2019 sources, Argentina\u2019s fiscal performance, improved during 1992-1996, declined in 1997 (2.1% of the GDP), climbed to 3.7% in 1998 and 6.6% in 1999. Professors Damill\u2019s and Frenkel\u2019s figures, based on more reliable sources, are different, showing a deficit of just 0.56% of the GDP in the 1991-1994 period. The difference is due to the fact that Edwards\u2019 secondary source considers debts incurred before the introduction of the currency board as expenditures. Between 1995 and 1997, the fiscal situation deteriorated because of the pension system reform implemented from 1994 onward.600 Fiscal surplus in any case is not synonymous with immunity to crisis. The fiscal situation significantly deteriorated from 1997 on, when the economy was affected by external shocks.601\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 204.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 207-210.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 213.\n\n645.\n\nAs to the role of the Provinces in the deterioration of fiscal accounts during the development of the crisis, Professor Edwards, according to Frenkel and Damill, fails to consider that a reform in this area would have involved major institutional problems (Argentina being a federal State) and taken a lot of time. After all, the provincial deficit had a limited influence on the increase in the aggregate imbalance of public accounts during the crisis.602\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 214.\n\n646.\n\nAs to external shocks being only \"temporary,\" this fails to consider that even though temporary, they may have lasting effects. The Brazilian crisis caused extensive damage to the Argentine economy.603\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 217.\n\n647.\n\nAs to Argentina\u2019s economy being \"closed,\" Frenkel and Damill point out that Argentina initiated more open trade at the beginning of the 90s. However, the ratio between international and domestic trade flows depends not only on such governmental policies but also on the behaviour of individuals. The degree of openness rose until 1997, dropped in 1998-2001, to rise again thereafter. So, trade protectionism did not frustrate the design of Argentina\u2019s economic policy.604\n\n*Ibid.,* Table 6 on p. 72 and \u00a7 224.\n\n648.\n\nDuring the hearing, Professors Damill and Frenkel mentioned that a financial system may collapse \"if [the process is] not arrested in time and if measures are not taken to arrest it, if the State does not intervene to break those trends.\"605 There was an improvement in Argentina\u2019s fiscal policy due to measures adopted during 1998-2001, but it was not sufficient to prevent contagion by the Southeast Asia crisis which increased the risk premium and interest rate, thus increasing public indebtedness.606\n\nHearing Transcript in English, *supra* note 67, Day 7, p. 1904.\n\n*Ibid. p.* 1914.\n\n*(v) The Application of Article XI: The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis of the State\u2019s Contribution to the Economic Crisis of 2001*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n649.\n\nIn addressing the question of whether Argentina contributed to the situation of necessity on which it relies to assert the lawfulness of the measures taken by it, the Tribunal will be guided essentially by two considerations. On the one hand, it acknowledges Argentina\u2019s right as a sovereign State to choose the economic policy best suited to the needs of the population. In that respect, the Tribunal is far from suggesting that actions by Argentina were specifically intended to hurt foreign investors or some of them, as Argentina appears to understand the Claimant\u2019s position.607 On the other hand, it will take due account of the fact that the protection offered by the BIT to the Claimant\u2019s investment is suspended to the extent that Article XI is applicable, which makes it necessary to analyse carefully all the conditions for the application of that Article.\n\nSee *supra,* \u00a7 635.\n\n650.\n\nIn conducting this analysis, the Tribunal shall not adopt a restrictive interpretation of necessity and its consequences under Article XI, as has been done by other tribunals in connection with the state-of-necessity defence under Article 25 of the ILC\u2019s Articles.608 As mentioned in its Decision on Jurisdiction in the present dispute,\n\n\"[t]his Tribunal considers that a balanced interpretation is needed, taking into account both State sovereignty and the State\u2019s responsibility to create an adapted and evolutionary framework for the development of economic activities, and the necessity to protect foreign investment and its continuing flow.\"609\n\nIt will rely on the evidence made available by the Parties in these proceedings, with very limited consideration of prior decisions in other cases involving Argentina since the arguments and evidence placed before each tribunal are not the same in every case. Finally, the Tribunal will take account of the fact that, as already mentioned,610 the Claimant bears the burden proving the facts regarding Argentina\u2019s contribution to the economic crisis of 2001.\n\nUnited Nations, *Report of the International Law Commission, Fifth-Third (53th) Session,* Fifty-Sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), 2001, \u00a7 20 (p. 205): \"necessity needs to be more narrowly confined.\"\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, *supra* note 58, \u00a7 70.\n\nSee *supra* \u00a7 626.\n\n651.\n\nThe review of the experts\u2019 reports conducted by the Tribunal allows it to single out a few aspects on which there is some convergence of opinions.\n\n652.\n\nArgentina\u2019s expert, Professor Roubini, acknowledges the significant role that Argentina\u2019s fiscal deficits and debt accumulation played in provoking the currency crisis of 2001. Although maintaining that the country\u2019s fiscal problems were partly aggravated by recession and external interest rates after 1998, his report suggests that the GOA\u2019s lack of fiscal control was already a problem by that time, as is shown by the following quotations:\n\n\"Argentina\u2019s fiscal deficits and debt accumulation worsened after 1998\";\n\n\"... while for the first few years the currency board was viable based upon economic fundamentals, starting in 1998 it became increasingly vulnerable and eventually not viable because of:... large fiscal imbalances and debt accumulation... ;\"\n\n\"Fiscal deficits and debt accumulation - partly worsened by recession and external interest rate shocks - made the pegged parity fragile and vulnerable to a speculative attack;\"\n\n\"In Argentina, persistent fiscal deficits... led to an accumulation of a growing stock of public debt, particularly as the economy began to shrink and interest rates rose after 1998.\"611\n\nProfessor Edwards also considers the absence of fiscal discipline as one of the causes of the economic and currency crisis of 2001.612\n\nRoubini Report, *supra* note 252, \u00a7\u00a7 16-17 and 21-23.\n\nCompare with the Edwards Report, *supra* note 571, \u00a7 14.\n\n653.\n\nProfessor Roubini equally concurs with Professor Edwards\u2019 view that Argentina\u2019s failure to liberalise labour markets and trade policies played a significant role in bringing about the 2001 currency crisis. He concedes that Argentina\u2019s \"inward-oriented trade policies\" and \"labour market rigidities\" \"made the fixed-rate regime fragile and vulnerable to shocks.\"613\n\nRoubini Report, *supra* note 252, \u00a7 24; title of Section V.\n\n654.\n\nThe experts diverge in their analysis of responsibility for causing the Argentina economic and currency crisis. While the Edwards Report considers such crisis to have been primarily self-induced by Argentina,614 Professor Roubini generally attributes the currency collapse to macroeconomic factors as including external shocks, although he concedes that \"slippages of fiscal policy\"615 occurred, an expression suggesting a reduced level of attention or performance.616\n\n*See supra,* \u00a7 404.\n\nA lively debate took place at the hearing during the cross-examination of Professor Roubini regarding his use of the expression \"slippages of fiscal policy.\" See Hearing Transcript in English, Day 2, pp. 344-346. The same expression was used by Professor Roubini during the hearing in the *Enron* case, see the relevant transcript shown by Mr. Schiffer (for the Claimant) to Professor Roubini during his cross-examination. Argentina objected to the document being shown at the hearing but the Chairman allowed the examination of Professor Roubini to continue. See Hearing Transcript in English, Day 2, pp. 342-343.\n\nThe word \"slippage\" is given, among others, the meaning of \"a decline in level, performance or achievement\" by *The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,* 4th ed., 2006.\n\n655.\n\nProfessors Frenkel and Damill\u2019s rebuttal of the Edwards Report is rather polemical and only in part based on data from external sources;617 no evidence is provided by the two experts in support of their various contentions. This is striking, considering that the Frenkel-Damill Report was meant to rebut that of Professor Edwards, a comprehensive, very detailed and well-documented work.618 The remark that Professor Edwards expressed only personal opinions therefore appears misguided.\n\nSuch as the rate of openness of Argentina\u2019s economy, Table 6 of Damill and Frenkel Report, *supra* note 595, p. 72.\n\nThe Edwards Report, *supra* note 571, is accompanied by 166 exhibits.\n\n656.\n\nIt is clear from the evidence filed in the present proceedings that both internal and external factors were at the root of the economic crisis that occurred in Argentina at the end of 2001. Having fully considered the Parties\u2019 arguments and the evidence before it, a majority of the Tribunal has reached the conclusion that Argentina\u2019s failure to control several internal factors, in particular the fiscal deficit debt accumulation and labour market rigidity, substantially contributed to the crisis. The progressive worsening of internal factors diminished Argentina\u2019s ability to respond adequately to external shocks, unlike what happened in other South American countries.\n\n657.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s conclusion finds support in independent and authoritative sources. Reference may be made to the IMF Independent Evaluation Office\u2019s (TEO) Evaluation Report of 2004: \"The IMF and Argentina, 1991-2001.\"619 That Report contains a comprehensive analysis of Argentina\u2019s situation in that period. The Report was examined and presumably approved by the Argentinian authorities and benefited from substantive contributions by Nouriel Roubini, Argentina\u2019s expert in the present proceedings.620\n\nThe following passages of the IEO Executive Summary are significant:\n\n\"The crisis resulted from the failure of Argentina policymakers to take necessary corrective measures sufficiently early, particularly in the consistency of fiscal policy with their choice of exchange rate regime. The IMF on its part erred in the precrisis period by supporting the country\u2019s weak policies too long, even after it had become evident in the late 1990s that the political ability to deliver the necessary fiscal discipline and structural reform was lacking.\"\n\n\"While fiscal policy improved substantially from previous decades, the initial gains were not sustained, and the election-driven increase in public spending led to a sharp deterioration in fiscal discipline in 1999. As a result, the stock of public debt steadily increased, diminishing the ability of the authorities to use countercyclical fiscal policy when the recession deepened.\"\n\n\"Insufficient attention was paid to the provincial finances, the sustainable level of public debt for a country with Argentina\u2019s economic characteristics was overestimated, and debt sustainability issues received limited attention.\"\n\n\"The IMF correctly identified structural fiscal reforms, social security reform, labour market reform, and financial sector reform as essential to enhancing the medium-term viability of the convertibility regime, by promoting fiscal discipline, flexibility and investment.\"\n\n\"Some gains were made in the early years, but the long-standing political obstacles to deeper reforms proved formidable. Little progress was made in later years, and the earlier reforms were even reversed in some cases.\"621\n\n*Ibid.,* Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 34.

The following statement made in Argentina\u2019s SEC Filing (2004) may be quoted here:\n\n\"The sustainability of Argentina\u2019s economic growth during the 1990s was *undermined by the Government\u2019s inability to maintain fiscal discipline.* Instead of capitalizing on periods of sustained growth and rising revenues to balance its budget and pay down its debt, the Government continued to incur overall fiscal deficits. This resulted primarily from inability to achieve political consensus about needed reforms, failure to reform revenue-sharing arrangements with the provinces, increasing debt service obligations and a widening gap between the Government\u2019s social security revenues and social security outlays attributable to the privatization of the social security system. The Government\u2019s inability to set its finance on a more sustainable course also undermined confidence in Argentina among foreign investors, increasing the Government\u2019s borrowing costs and threatening the capital inflows on which the country had come to depend.\"622\n\nAmendment No. 3 to Registration Statement Under Schedule B of the Securities Act of 1933, The Republic of Argentina (registrant), as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on 28 September 2004, p. 14. Claimant\u2019s Exhibit No. 373. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n659.\n\nAccording to the former Argentine Minister of the Economy and Finance, Domingo Cavallo,\n\n\"[t]he most important lesson to be learned from the Argentine experience relates to the importance of fiscal policy and, particularly, of fiscal discipline during good times. In my 1994 interview, I emphasized the role of fiscal balance as a precondition for stability. However, stability requires more than just that. During periods of rapid growth and favorable external conditions, it is necessary to generate fiscal surplus as a cushion for the negative external shocks that may show up unexpectedly at any moment. Argentina should have done this between 1991 and 1994, and again between 1996 and 1998, but it did not. Therefore, at the time of external shocks, it depended on foreign financing precisely at a time when foreign expectations turned sour.\"623\n\nDomingo Cavallo, \"Eleven Years Later: What Went Wrong in Argentina, 2003 - 2006,\" Vol 27, *Harv.

Yet it failed because it was not supported by a State that would observe the reasonable restrictions on progressive fiscal deficit accumulation, which worked to blow up the colourful balloon of public debt year after year. In January 2002, the balloon finally burst, and the two Ds\u2019 (devaluation and default) started walking the path of uncertainty.\"624\n\nAlieto Guadagni, \"El fin de una ilusi\u00f3n: la crisis argentina de 2002\" *Revista de Occidente* No. 251, Madrid, April 2002, p. 63.

We spent more than we earned; we failed to complete the full cycle of economic reforms; and we tied ourselves to the most productive economy in the world without building our own productivity. Of course, this was compounded by the global decline in commodity prices, by protectionism in key markets and by shifts in global capital flows. *Yet Argentina\u2019s crisis is largely home grown.\"625*\n\nEduardo Duhalde, *Argentina Regrets,* Financial Times (FT.com), 12 July 2004.

Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n662.\n\nIn 2002, Professor Gary Becker, 1992 Nobel Economist of the University of Chicago, found that \"[t]he current [2002] crisis again is mainly due to politicians who continued to borrow on the international capital market to finance large and growing budget deficits.\"626\n\nGary S.

Becker concluded three years later that the GOA\u2019s lack of fiscal discipline led to the eventual crisis: \"the Argentina problem arose because spending by the government, including the provinces, was very excessive and was not controlled.\"627\n\nGary S.

This is an old and a sad story for Argentina.\"628\n\nMussa, Michael, *Argentina and The Fund: From Triumph to Tragedy,* Institute for International Economics, Washington, D.C., 25 March 2002, p.6, Annex 5 to the Edwards Report, *supra* note 571.\n\n665.\n\nIt is true, as has been said, that, \"qualified observers remain in disagreement as to the exact causes of the crisis and the mix of measures that might have avoided it.\"629 However, having found that Article XI is not \"self-judging,\" the Tribunal has the power and duty to make sure that all conditions for its application are satisfied, including the absence of a substantial contribution by Argentina to the crisis of 2001. While accepting that \"in economic matters, the analysis of causation... does not lend itself to the same scientific analysis as in the domain of the so-called exact sciences and of natural phenomenon,\"630 the evidence presented by the Claimant regarding the actions and omissions by Argentina until the end of 2001, and Argentina\u2019s own admission of its \"inability to maintain a fiscal discipline,\" support the conclusion of a majority of the Tribunal that Argentina contributed to the crisis to a substantial extent, so that Article XI cannot come to its rescue.\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 224.\n\n*Ibid.,* footnote 357, pp. 105-106.\n\n666.\n\nArbitrator Stem, while she agrees, as a matter of principle, with the theoretical analysis of the role played by the contribution by a State to a situation of necessity as expressed in paragraphs 613-626, does not consider that, on the concrete level, the contribution of a State to an economic crisis should be lightly assumed - should the US be held responsible of the worldwide subprime crisis as it contributed to it, because the SEC did not monitor the banks closely enough? Moreover, she is of the view that, considering the facts of this case, the substantial contribution of the Argentine authorities to the crisis has not been sufficiently proven by strong and uncontroverted evidence presented by the Claimant.\n\n667.\n\nArbitrator Stem disagrees with the far-reaching conclusion by the majority, which is not based, in her view, on an in-depth understanding of the intricacies of economic development. It should not lightly be assumed that a State is responsible for an economic collapse in a liberal market economy, where the invisible hand of the market is more powerful than the hand of the State. The majority, after having presented the experts\u2019 evidence on both sides and concluded that the latter diverged on the analysis for the responsibilities of the economic crisis, the Claimant expert considering, not surprisingly, that the crisis was primarily self-induced and the Respondent\u2019s expert holding, unsurprisingly too, that the essential factors of the crisis were external shocks. The experts have presented contradictory analyses. The IMF itself recognised that it made mistakes in monitoring Argentina\u2019s problems, as can be seen in the citation of one of its reports in paragraph 657 of this Award, where it is recognised that \"the IMF on its part erred in the precrisis period.\"\n\n668.\n\nEconomics is a complicated science or, better, a complicated art; the mere reading of the analyses of the experts of both Parties show that there is little certainty. In Arbitrator Stern\u2019s view, the conclusion reached by the majority is based essentially on a comparative analysis of the expert reports, the Edwards\u2019 Report being described as \"comprehensive, very detailed and well documented,\" while the Frenkel/Damil report is said to be \"rather polemical and only in part based on data from external sources.\" In her view, the situation of the Argentine economy was extremely serious and *out of control* by any definition. Many publicly well known events support this conclusion, and there is no reason to doubt the statement, made by Argentina, that it was \"the worst economic crisis (which later became a political and institutional crisis) ever experienced by the Argentine Republic as from its onset in 1810.\"631 A serious clue to the gravity of the crisis was the decrease of Argentina\u2019s contribution to the United Nations:\n\n\"In May 2002, the critical situation caused the United Nations Organization General Assembly to reduce Argentina\u2019s contribution to such organization. It was *the first time in history* that the organization decreased the contribution to be made by a member state and the decision was taken unanimously by its members.\"632\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 108.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 120 referring to Report of the Committee on Contributions, U.N.

Emphasis added.\n\n669.\n\nMoreover, according to Arbitrator Stern, the measures adopted were necessary to prevent the crisis from resulting in anarchy and social disintegration and they constituted a suitable means to overcome the chaos. It should also be recorded that the policies followed by Argentina before the crisis were generally supported by the World Bank and that the measures taken to address the crisis had the support and encouragement of the IMF. This has been stressed, for example, in *Continental:*\n\n\"In its *Second Review* of January 2001, the IMF staff noted that \"the external environment worsened in the subsequent months, with external financing to emerging markets nearly drying up. This was compounded by domestic political uncertainties, which raised doubts about the political governability of the country. (...) The authorities have responded to these adverse developments by strengthening the growth orientation of their economic program, through measures aimed at promoting a recovery of investment, and an accelerated implementation of structural reforms.... *\"In view of the staff this strategy is appropriate, and deserves the increased financial support of the international community... A recovery of confidence hinges,* in turn, not only on a relatively benign international environment, but perhaps more importantly, *on a demonstrated, unwavering commitment by the authorities to a rapid and full implementation of their announced policies.\"633*\n\n*Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 112. Emphasis by the *Continental* tribunal.\n\n670.\n\nIn other words, Argentina adopted mainstream policies, following the Washington consensus, and earned praise for its conduct from the international financial community. Therefore, Arbitrator Stern is inclined to adopt the same conclusion as in *Continental, i.e.* that the evidence is insufficient to conclude that the policies adopted by the GOA before the crisis were mainly responsible for the crisis. More could be said on the period during which a state of emergency existed, but this seems unnecessary, considering the decision of the majority. If needed, however, she would adopt dates essentially similar to those adopted by the *LG&E* tribunal, *i.e.* from 1 December 2001 to 26 April 2003.634 As a result of such an approach, the consequences of the measures on the decision to sell taken between 6 January 2002 and 23 April 2003 should not have been considered. However, the minority Arbitrator, being in agreement with the other analyses of the Tribunal, did not consider it necessary to append a dissenting opinion, as the divergence on the application of Article XI does not have far-reaching consequences on the material aspects of the final disposal of the case.\n\n*In. LG&E. supra* note 51, the Tribunal considered that a state of emergency existed from 1 December 2001 to 26 April 2003, stating: \"These dates coincide, on the one hand, with the Government\u2019s announcement of the measure freezing funds, which prohibited bank account owners from withdrawing more than one thousand pesos monthly and, on the other hand, with the election of President Kirchner. The Tribunal marks these dates as the beginning and end of the period of extreme crisis in view of the notorious events that occurred during this period.\" \u00a7 230.\n\n**VI.

Emphasis by the Claimant.\n\n674.\n\nThe discounted cash flow (\"DCF\") method adopted by the Claimant\u2019s expert, LECG, removes from the damages analysis losses due to macroeconomic conditions in Argentina by capturing only those that result directly from the GOA measures.637\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 874 and 880, referring to LECG\u2019s Damage Valuation Update of 23 November 2006 (\"Updated Report\"), \u00a7\u00a7 144-147.\n\n675.\n\nThe only reason for Macroconsulting\u2019s comparables approach showing damages different from LECG\u2019s method is that the actual equity value of CAPEX and Costanera was substantially higher than LECG\u2019s due to the arbitrary reduction by 35% of their debts as of 31 December 2001. This means that by simply correcting this aspect, the two valuations are very similar, thus showing the soundness of LEGC\u2019s work.638\n\nReply, \u00a7 883.\n\n676.\n\nTherefore, LECG\u2019s valuation methodology takes into account only the measures and not the macroeconomic situation, but nothing but the measures, considered to be the sole cause of the sale, the consequences of the crisis having been eliminated from the calculation.\n\n*(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n677.\n\nArgentina contends that there is no causal connection between the alleged breach and the losses that El Paso alleges to have incurred. For such connection to exist, the internationally wrongful act must be the proximate cause of the loss, which is not denied by the Claimant.639\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 781; Rejoinder, \u00a7 601.\n\n678.\n\nAccording to Argentina, two criteria have been applied by international courts to determine such proximate cause, one objective (the damage must by the natural and normal result of the wrongful act) and one subjective (the damage was a reasonably foreseeable consequence of that act or was so intended by the perpetrator).640 Not only has the Claimant not proven the causality link; it has, rather, confirmed having caused the losses by its own acts.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 782-784.\n\n679.\n\nNone of the GOA measures constitutes the proximate cause of the damage alleged by the Claimant, regardless of whether the objective or the subjective criterion is applied, since they result from the macroeconomic, social and political situation suffered by Argentina as of late 2001. The damage allegedly suffered by El Paso were caused by the latter\u2019s decision to sell its assets in the worst time of the crisis in Argentina, as confirmed by the 2003 Report to the SEC and by Macroconsulting\u2019s comparables method.641 Should it be held that there is a causal connection between the GOA measures and the Claimant\u2019s damage, the Claimant should bear part of such damage, having decided to sell at the time when the country\u2019s macroeconomic conditions had considerably reduced the value of its investment.642\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 785-792; Rejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 602-607; RPHB, \u00a7\u00a7 212-216.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 619-621.\n\n680.\n\nContrary to the comparables method used by Macroconsulting, the DCF method is a sophisticated device that requires much information and makes assumptions regarding several variables, so that this device can be easily manipulated by the party using it.643\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7608.\n\n681.\n\nArgentina\u2019s primary position is that its measures played no role at all in the decision of El Paso to sell its shares, its secondary position being that the decision to sell in 2003 resulted also from economic considerations by the Claimant, with the consequence that the latter\u2019s decision played a role in the damage suffered by it.\n\n***2. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n682.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the view expressed by other investment treaty tribunals that the test of causation is whether there is a sufficient link between the damage and the treaty violation.644\n\n*S.D. Myers, supra* note 176, \u00a7 315 (referring to \"harm that is proved to have sufficient causal link\" with the specific breach); *LG&E v. Argentina, supra* note 51, \u00a7 50; *BG v. Argentina, supra* note 293, \u00a7 428. See also the Report of the International Law Commission to the UN General Assembly on the Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001: \"Various terms are used to describe the link which must exist between the wrongful act and the injury in order for the obligation of reparation to arise. For example, reference may be made to losses attributable [to the wrongful act] as a proximate cause, or to damage which is too indirect, remote and uncertain to be appraised.\" (Commentary to Article 31, \u00a7 10, p. 227).\n\n683.\n\nIn essence, the Respondent contends that there is no causal connection between the GOA measures and the damage allegedly suffered by the Claimant since the latter decided to sell at the worst possible time of the financial crisis, the country\u2019s macroeconomic conditions at that time being the cause of the reduced value of its investment.645\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 619-621.\n\n684.\n\nIt cannot be denied that the general economic situation was taken into account by El Paso when deciding the sale in question.646 However, contrary to what is mentioned by Argentina,647 there is no contribution by the Claimant to a loss it suffered due to its own conduct, in the absence of wilful or negligent action by the Claimant.648 The Tribunal does not view the sale by the Claimant of its investment in the Argentinian companies as a wilful or negligent action, *\"i.e.* an action which manifests a lack of due care on the part of the victim of the breach for his or her own property or right.\"649 The Tribunal has examined the relationship between the sale of El Paso\u2019s shares in the Argentinian companies and the GOA measures in the context of determining whether such measures may be considered a violation of the FET standard, concluding that the measures were the prevailing cause of the sale.650\n\n*Supra,* \u00a7 505.\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7\u00a7 619-621.\n\nArticle 39 of ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"Contribution to the injury\"): \"In the determination of reparation, account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is sought.\"\n\nTo use the words of the International Law Commission Report to the UN General Assembly, 2002, \u00a7 5, p. 276.\n\n*Supra,* \u00a7 507.\n\n685.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that LECG has calculated the Claimant\u2019s damage under its DCF valuation method by considering only damage directly attributable to the GOA measures, to the exclusion of damage which might be attributable to the financial crisis. As explained by LECG:\n\n\"In our DCF Approach (both the 2004 and the 2006 update we discuss below), the macroeconomic indicators, as well as all available ex-post company performance information are included in the building of cash flows from January 2002 onwards. Thus, the DCF analysis is based on actual sales volumes and costs that fully reflect all the *actual* macroeconomic conditions in which the companies have been operating in Argentina since January 2002 to date. This is true for both the *but for* and *actual* scenarios, so as to make the comparison between the two scenarios compatible and avoid attributing damages to factors other than the Government measures. In other words, volumes and costs reflect the impact of the 2002 recession, and of the dramatic economic recovery of 2003 onwards.\"651\n\nLECG\u2019s Updated Report, \u00a7 145. Emphasis in the original.\n\n686.\n\nThe circumstance that the valuation of the Claimant\u2019s damage, based on LECG\u2019s DCF method, refers only to the impact of the measures on the value of its investment is confirmed by the Tribunal\u2019s Expert, Professor Geoffron, in his Report of 6 April 2010.652 The Respondent has criticised the use of the DCF method653 but has not disputed the fact that LECG\u2019s has only considered the effect of the GOA measures on the value of the Claimant\u2019s investment when evaluating the latter\u2019s damage.\n\nThe Report explains that it is to be \"aimed at assessing whether and to what extent El Paso Energy International Company interests in Argentina have been damaged by the measures taken by the Government...\" (\u00a7 33).\n\nAs discussed later in this decision, the DCF method is accepted by the Tribunal as the most appropriate valuation method in this case, *infra,* \u00a7 705.\n\n687.\n\nThe Tribunal has held previously that the Respondent\u2019s measures were a contributory cause of the damage suffered by the Claimant for the loss of value of its investment in the Argentinian companies.654 The Tribunal concludes that a causal connection exists between the GOA measures and the Claimant\u2019s damage.\n\n*Supra,* \u00a7 509.\n\nB. COMPENSATION\n---------------\n\n***1. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n688.\n\nWhat follows is a summary of each Party\u2019s position regarding compensation due to the Claimant for breach of the BIT. More will be said on the subject when analysing the Tribunal\u2019s Expert\u2019s reports discussing the position of the Parties\u2019 accounting experts on the various issues relating to the damages assessment.\n\n*(i) The Claimant \u2019s Position*\n------------------------------\n\n689.\n\nEl Paso claims damages based on the loss of value of its investment due to GOA measures taken in violation of its legal and contractual rights and not, as alleged by the Respondent, because it sold in bad macroeconomic conditions.655\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 873 and 875.\n\n690.\n\nThe amount claimed is estimated by LECG on the basis of two alternative valuation methodologies, the DCF and the transactions methods.656 Both methods are reasonable and valid means to calculate the damage inflicted by the GOA measures on the Claimant.657 LECG\u2019s Updated Report demonstrates that as of 31 December 2006 the Claimant suffered damage amounting to US$ 147 million under the DCF method and US$ 210 million under the transactions method.658 The amount under the DCF method is increased in LECG\u2019s Report of 22 March 2007 to US$ 228.2 million (including export withholding taxes up to February 2012).\n\nA third method, unjust enrichment, proposed initially by the Claimant (LECG\u2019s 1st Report, Section V.10), is not mentioned in the Reply and in LECG\u2019s Updated Report.\n\nReply, \u00a7 857.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 876.\n\n691.\n\nThe DCF model takes into account the conditions prevailing after the sales made in 2003 (such as current crude oil prices) since it assumes that El Paso would not have sold its investments in the absence of the GOA measures. The transactions method measures the Claimant\u2019s damage by comparing what a reasonable buyer would have paid for the assets in mid-2003 in the absence of the GOA measures to El Paso\u2019s actual sale proceeds in the light of the measures, therefore not using post-sale information.659\n\nReply, \u00a7 875.\n\n692.\n\nContrary to Argentina\u2019s contention that the DCF method has \"a high degree of uncertainty and includes an uncertain loss of profits\",660 that method is the most recognised and applied, as shown by other cases involving the Argentinian measures at issue in the present case.661 El Paso is not claiming lost profits but rather the reduction of the market value of its Argentinian assets as a result of the GOA measures, even if a key component of the DCF method is future cash flows, which is analogous to accounting profits.662\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 798.\n\nReply, \u00a7 885.\n\nReply, \u00a7 886.\n\n*(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n693.\n\nAs already mentioned *(supra,* \u00a7 672), Argentina contends that even if it were found liable for breach of the BIT, the damage asserted by El Paso would not be the proximate consequence of that breach.663 It asserts further that the sale by El Paso took place at one of the worst moment of the Argentinian economy and that the sales were due to El Paso\u2019s own problems.664\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 601.\n\n*Ibid..* \u00a7\u00a7 603 and 605.\n\n694.\n\nAlways according to Argentina, it is unreasonable to take into account post-sale conditions (such as current crude oil prices) in the damages assessment since, on the one side, El Paso cannot benefit from the increase in the price of the assets marketed following the sale of its investments665 and, on the other side, this contradicts Article IV(1) of the BIT under which \"compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment *immediately before the expropriatory action was taken... \"666*\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7609.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 611. Emphasis by the Respondent\n\n695.\n\nThe DCF method embodies a wide range of inherently speculative elements, as stated by the International Law Commission (\"ILC\") and by arbitral awards.667 The Claimant\u2019s statement that the damages claimed is not uncertain since it does not include any loss of profits is incorrect, considering that with the DCF method *lucrum cessans* becomes the sole element of compensation, as held by the *Amoco v. Iran* tribunal.668\n\nRejoinder, \u00a7 624.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 625.\n\n696.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the compensation standard should be the same as that applicable in cases of expropriation, namely fair market value. This is wrong, since the compensation applying in cases of expropriation cannot be obtained for the lower responsibility threshold of other Treaty violations.669 Additionally, damage deriving from the export withholdings on hydrocarbons cannot be included in the calculation of damages.670\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7\u00a7 627-630.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7631.\n\n697.\n\nLECG\u2019s assessment of damages presents serious errors regarding its methodology and the assumptions made, as stated in the Counter-Memorial and the Macroconsulting\u2019s reports.671 There are also doubts regarding the sum obtained from the sale of El Paso\u2019s investment in CAPSA, so that LECG\u2019s use of that sum to assess the damages is also suspicious.672\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 632.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 639.\n\n***2. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n698.\n\nThe Tribunal has duly considered the reports and testimonies of the experts retained by each Party, Dr. Manuel Abdala and Dr. Pablo T. Spiller of LECG (for the Claimant), Dr. Mart\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Pardina of Macroconsulting (for the Respondent). In view of the number and complexity of the accounting issues relating to the damages assessment, as evidenced by the diverging views given on many relevant questions by the Parties\u2019 experts, the Tribunal, with the agreement of the Parties, has appointed its own expert in the person of Professor Patrice Geoffron, Professor of Economics at the University Paris-Dauphine (the \"Expert\").\n\n699.\n\nThe Report produced by the Expert on 6 April 2010 (the \"April Report\") was transmitted to the Parties on 14 April 2010. The Expert answered the observations made by the Parties on 21 May 2010 on the April Report, as directed by the Tribunal, by a \"Complementary Note\" of 10 July 2010 (the \"July Report\"), followed by a Final Revision of 12 October 2010 (the \"October Report\"). Both the July and October Reports were transmitted to the Parties on 22 November 2010 and comments thereon were filed by the Parties on 27 December 2010. The Expert\u2019s Reports and the Parties\u2019 comments shall be examined by the Tribunal in the context of determining the damages due to the Claimant. This will be done after establishing the principles that should govern the valuation of the damages in the present case.\n\n*(i) The Indemnification Standard*\n----------------------------------\n\n700.\n\nThe BIT does not specify the standard for evaluating damages to which the investor is entitled in case of breach of a standard of treatment, such as that of fair and equitable treatment (as in the present case). Only in the event of lawful expropriation, which is not a treaty breach, Article IV (1) of the BIT refers to the \"fair market value\" immediately before expropriation. In the absence of an agreed criterion, the appropriate standard of reparation under international law is compensation for the losses suffered by the party affected, as established by the Permanent Court of International Justice (\"PCU\") in the *Factory of Chorz\u00f3w* case (\" *Chorz\u00f3w Factory\")* in 1928:\n\n\"The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act - a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals - is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"673\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory,* Judgment No. 13 (Claim for Indemnity - The Merits) of 13 September 1928, ICJ Reports 1928, P.C.I.J., Series A, No. 17, p. 47.\n\n701.\n\nMany tribunals have applied this principle in deciding on damages due for breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment.674 As noted by the tribunal in *SD Myers v. Canada,* the silence of the treaty indicates the intention of the drafters \"to leave it open to tribunals to determine a measure of compensation appropriate to the specific circumstances of the case,\"675 adding that \"whatever precise approach is taken, it should reflect the general principle of international law that compensation should undo the material harm inflicted by a breach of an international obligation.\"676\n\n*S.D. Myers, supra* note 176, \u00a7\u00a7 311-315; *Metalclad supra* note 190, \u00a7 122; *MTD, supra* note 300, \u00a7 238; *CMS supra* note 48, \u00a7 400; *Azurix, supra* note 50, \u00a7 409; *Enron, supra* note 52, \u00a7 359; *Sempra, supra* note 53, \u00a7 400.\n\n*S.D. Myers, supra* note 176, \u00a7 309.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 315.\n\n702.\n\nIn cases involving Argentina where, absent a finding of expropriation, a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the BIT was found, other tribunals have held that damage should compensate for the difference in the \"fair market value\" of the investment resulting from the Treaty breach.677 Fair market value has been so defined:\n\n\"the price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a hypothetical willing and able seller, acting at arm\u2019s length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.\"678\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 *410**;* *Azurix, supra* note 50, \u00a7 424; *Enron, supra* note 52, \u00a7 361.\n\n*International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms,* American Society of Appraisers, ASA website, 6 June 2001, p. 4.\n\n703.\n\nThe Tribunal shares this approach. The \"fair market value\" standard shall therefore be adopted to determine the value of the loss suffered by the Claimant by comparing the fair market value of El Paso\u2019s investment with and without the GOA measures (respectively, the *actual* and the *but for* scenarios).\n\n704.\n\nFair market value is the valuation standard adopted by the BIT to calculate compensation due in case of lawful expropriation under Article IV(1). However, in the present case; the Tribunal is not confronted with a lawful expropriation but with a breach of the BIT. The majority of the Tribunal takes account of the difference between the two situations and of the fact that, as established by the *dictum* in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act.\" The fair market value in the *but for* scenario shall be calculated considering also data and information which became known after 1 January 2002, including after El Paso\u2019s sales in 2003, to the extent they are representative of financially assessable damages.679 Arbitrator Stem considers that a fair market value evaluation of damage resulting from a violation of FET should only take into account what a willing buyer and a willing seller could foresee at the time of the interference with the investor\u2019s rights. However, as, for reasons explained in paragraph 736, the Tribunal finally relies on a valuation taking into account the prices of oil as foreseen in 2003, at the time of the sale, she does not expand on the theoretical aspects of the question of the indemnification standard and the time of valuation.\n\nTo use the words of Article 36 of ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, *infra,* \u00a7 703.\n\n705.\n\nThese valuation criteria are in keeping with principles of public international law. It is worth reproducing the relevant passage of the Judgment in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case:\n\n\"Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it - such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount of compensation due for an act contrary to international law... The dispossession of an industrial undertaking... then involves the obligation to restore the undertaking and, if this be not possible, *to pay its value at the time of the indemnification,* which value is designed to take the place of restitution which has become impossible.\"680\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory, supra* note 673, pp. 47-48. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n*(ii) The Valuation Date*\n-------------------------\n\n706.\n\nTo pay the value of the property *\"at the time of indemnification\",* as stated by the above *dictum,* means that the property (in our case, El Paso\u2019s participation in the Argentinian companies) is to be evaluated by reference not to the time of the dispossession, as in the case of a lawful expropriation, but to the time when compensation is paid. Compensation is in fact in lieu of restitution that \"has become impossible\", so that it should correspond \"to the value which a restitution in kind would bear\" (as stated by the *Chorz\u00f3ow Factory* Judgment in the passage cited).\n\n707.\n\nIn the *Amco Asia v. Indonesia* Resubmitted Case, the respondent State was found by the ICSID tribunal responsible for an unlawful interference with the Claimant\u2019s rights to develop and operate a hotel complex in Indonesia. The tribunal emphasised the difference of the standard of damages after an unlawful act, which should be based on the principle of full reparation, and the standard of compensation after a lawful expropriation:\n\n\"It may, on one view, be the case that in a lawful taking, Amco would have been entitled to the fair market value of the contract at the moment of dispossession. In making such a valuation, a Tribunal in 1990 would necessarily exclude factors subsequent to 1980. But if Amco is to be placed as if the contract had remained in effect, then subsequent known factors bearing on that performance are to be reflected in the valuation technique..,\"681\n\nAmco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Award of 5 June 1990, \u00a7 186.\n\n708.\n\nThe tribunal emphasised the reasons why developments up to the time of the award had to be taken into account:\n\n\"Foreseeability not only bears on causation rather than on quantum, but it would anyway be an inappropriate test for damages that approximate to restitution in integrum. The only subsequent factors relevant to value which are not be relied on are those attributable to the illegality itself.\"682\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n709.\n\nIn making its assessment of damages, the tribunal further stated:\n\n\"But as to valuation techniques for 1980-1989 the tribunal will not use the perspective of what the reasonable businessman in 1980 could foresee, because for this period it can use known data for relevant factors.\"683\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 196. Other tribunals have adopted the same approach to assess damages caused by the GOA measures. The tribunal in *CMS* relied on actual post-2001 events, such as the peso-dollar exchange rate, cost of equity, natural gas demand and other factors, *supra* note 48, \u00a7\u00a7 442-463). In *Siemens,* it was held that \"under customary international law, Siemens is entitled not just to the value of its enterprise as of May 18, 2001, the date of expropriation, but also to any greater value that the enterprise has gained up to the date of this Award, plus any consequential damages.\", *supra* note 133, Award of 6 February 2007, \u00a7 352.\n\n710.\n\nArticle 36 (\"Compensation\") of the ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts provides the following:\n\n\"1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution.\n\n2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage, including loss of profits insofar as it is established.\"\n\nAfter considering the above *dictum* in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, the ILC\u2019s Commentary of this Article concludes that \"the function of compensation is to address *the actual losses* incurred as a result of the internationally wrongful act.\"684 The reference to *\"loss of profits\"* in Article 36(2) confirms that the value of the property should be determined with reference to a date subsequent to that of the internationally wrongful act, provided the damage is *\"financially assessable\"*, therefore not speculative. The Tribunal shares this position.\n\nILC Commentary, Article 36, page 245. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n*(iii) The Valuation Method*\n----------------------------\n\n711.\n\nThe Expert\u2019s opinion is that \"the Transaction approach presents uncertain reliability for assessing economic damages in the context of the Argentine crisis,\"685 while the Comparable method, proposed by Macroconsulting, is not favored by financial practitioners \"due to the restricted reliability of sounds sets of comparables in the local market.\"686 The DCF method is preferred, as being \"by far the most widely used as a primary valuation tool.\"687\n\nApril Report, \u00a7 65.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 77.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n712.\n\nThe Tribunal endorses the choice of the DCF method as being the most appropriate in the circumstances, considering also its consistency with the Expert\u2019s chosen valuation standard. The method has been used widely, including by numerous arbitral tribunals in similar circumstances.688 It makes it possible to assess the loss of value of El Paso\u2019s investment due solely to the GOA measures, including the Argentinian companies\u2019 capacity, as going concerns, to generate returns.\n\nThe DCF method has been adopted by other awards in cases involving Argentina in relation to the measures taken as of January 2002: *CMS, supra* note 48 \u00a7 416; *Enron, supra* note 52, \u00a7 385; *Sempra, supra* note 53, \u00a7 416.\n\n*(iv) The Tribunal\u2019s Findings*\n------------------------------\n\n713.\n\nHaving established the valuation standard to be applied and the methodology to be used, the Tribunal shall now examine the Expert\u2019s Reports insofar as they also respond to the Parties\u2019 comments. This will allow the Tribunal to establish to what extent the Expert\u2019s findings and conclusions may be shared as to individual issues bearing on the quantum determination. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis shall be concluded by the assessment of the amount of compensation due to the Claimant for the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the BIT.\n\n714.\n\nThe DCF method having been chosen, it is correct to take LECG\u2019s DCF model as the basis for damages assessment, as was done by the Expert. Macroconsulting having chosen another method, LECG\u2019s model is the only DCF model available.\n\n715.\n\nThe Tribunal has analysed LECG\u2019s DCF model with the Expert\u2019s assistance and is satisfied that it conforms to the principles that are to be applied to assess El Paso\u2019s damages in the frame of the chosen valuation standard. Reference is made in particular to LECG\u2019s explanations of the chosen methodology and to how cash flows have been built.689\n\nLECG\u2019s Updated Report, \u00a7\u00a7 145-147, footnotes omitted. \"In our DCF Approach (both the 2004 and the 2006 update we discuss below), the macroeconomic indicators, as well as all available ex-post company performance information is included in the building of cash flows from January 2002 onwards. Thus, the DCF analysis is based on actual sales volumes and costs that fully reflect all the actual macroeconomic conditions in which the companies have been operating in Argentina since January 2002 to date. This is true for both the but for and actual scenarios, so as to make the comparison between the two scenarios compatible and avoid attributing damages to factors other than the Government measures. In other words, volumes and costs reflect the impact of the 2002 recession, and of the dramatic economic recovery of 2003 onwards.   \nConsider, for example, the calculation of the companies\u2019 operating costs. All cost components such as labor, as well as other costs that are not linked to revenue or output levels are the same in the but for and actual scenarios and are invariant to the Government measures.   \nThe only cost component that is attributable to the Government measures (the cost of natural gas for Central Costanera) is modelled differently between the but for and the actual. In this way, we strictly capture damages that are solely attributable to the measures, and not due to any other differences between scenarios.   \nFurthermore, in our DCF analysis we assumed domestic sales were affected by the economic crisis. Indeed, in both the actual and but for scenarios, El Paso\u2019s electricity generation companies\u2019 output declined in 2002, immediately after the crisis. The reduction in output reflects the impact of the recession on electricity sales, which affected Capex (a reduction of 10% as compared to 2001 output) and Central Costanera (a 36% reduction). Our damage analysis fully takes this impact into account, by subjecting both the but for and the actual scenario to the same macroeconomic shock. Thus, all effects from the devaluation of 2002 as well as the macroeconomic factors surrounding it are fully taken into account in our damage analysis in a way that is consistent with the computation of damages attributable to the Government measures only.\"\n\n716.\n\nThe Tribunal has initially submitted to the Expert a number of questions under the \"Terms of Reference for the Independent Expert Appointed by the Tribunal\".690 Six issues have been examined by the Expert\u2019s Reports in answer to the Tribunal\u2019s questions691:\n\n(a) the WAAC\n\n(b) the debt discount\n\n(c) the withholding tax\n\n(d) the oil prices\n\n(e) the benefits accruing to El Paso from the pesification and other measures\n\n(f) the value collected by El Paso for the sale of the Argentinian companies.\n\nApril Report, Appendix 8.1.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 83.\n\n717.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that, by dealing with these issues, the Expert\u2019s Reports answer adequately the questions submitted to him.\n\n*(a) The WAAC*\n--------------\n\n718.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 experts have proposed widely divergent discount rates regarding the WAAC. Macroconsulting\u2019s rate averages 35%, while LECG\u2019s rate averages 12-13%. The April Report criticises both rates, the former as not reflecting a fair market value since it attributes \"all the value variation to the economic crisis\" while the latter is \"too low to reflect the increasing risk to private investors in December 31st, 2001\", so as to be \"strangely \u2018immune\u2019 from the economic crisis.\"692\n\nApril Report, \u00a7\u00a7 5 and 88.\n\n719.\n\nIn discussing what should be the appropriate discount rate for 31 December 2001, the April Report underlines that, contrary to LECG\u2019s analysis, private investors are not immune from the consequences of a sovereign default, being indirectly exposed to Argentina\u2019s sovereign credit risk.693 This leads the Expert to \"upgrade\" the discount rate proposed by LECG, the latter being consistent with a risk assessment in November 2001 but not reflecting the increasing threat to private investors in December 2001.\n\n*Ibid.*,\u00a7 93.\n\n720.\n\nThis consideration leads the Expert to re-evaluate the discount rate proposed by LECG according to the change in the country risk between November and December 2001. Following the Claimant\u2019s expert\u2019s remark, the final WAAC\u2019s values retained by the Expert are 15.45% for electricity and 15.43% for hydrocarbons.694\n\nJuly Report, \u00a7 55.\n\n721.\n\nThe Tribunal shares the Expert\u2019s view that the discount rate, in a situation such as that confronting Argentina at the end of 2001, must consider the increase in the country risk between November and December 2001. The Expert\u2019s measure of LECG\u2019s WAACs is reasonable, as is confirmed by the result of the calculation which, while accounting for the increased country risk, does not make the new WAACs incompatible with fair market value. The re-evaluated WAACs are therefore accepted.\n\n*(b) The Deb t Discourt t*\n--------------------------\n\n722.\n\nHere again the Parties\u2019 experts have expressed widely divergent views. LECG states that no discount should be applied to the debts of Costanera (US$ 383 million) and CAPEX (US$ 285 million) since the book value of the two companies\u2019 debts before and after the GOA measures were similar due to the implementation of debt restructuring agreements with the lenders. Applying a discount to such value would therefore, according to LECG, not make sense economically. Macroconsulting, on the contrary, stresses that the completion of the debt restructuring in 2005 is not relevant to the debt values in December 2001 and that account should be taken of the economic crisis of the period.\n\n723.\n\nThe Expert opines that keeping unchanged the book value of the debts in a turbulent period such as that characterising Argentina\u2019s economy in December 2001 would not be in line with the dominant view in the literature. He proposes to apply a debt discount that is not to be ascribed entirely to the economic crisis, as proposed by Macrocosuiting, but that reflects the negative and continued impacts of both the GOA measures and the crisis in the *actual* scenario and only the impact of the crisis in the *but for* scenario.695\n\nApril Report, \u00a7 146.\n\n724.\n\nBy following an approach inspired by the reasoning adopted to re-evaluate the WAACs, the Expert proposes a debt discount of 35% in the *actual* scenario and of 26.25% in the *but for* scenario.696 This assessment was subsequently confirmed by the Expert.697\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7 157.\n\nJuly Report, \u00a7 58.\n\n725.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Expert that keeping the value of Costanera\u2019s and CAPEX\u2019 debts unchanged in the turbulent period experienced by Argentina\u2019s economy in December 2001 would not reflect the real value of the debts. A discount should therefore be applied to reconcile their value with the market value. The Tribunal also agrees that a debt discount should be separately calculated for the *but for* scenario and for the *actual* scenario, as proposed by the Expert and accepts the two figures proposed by the Expert.\n\n*(c) The Withholding Tax*\n-------------------------\n\n726.\n\nThe April Report distinguishes between a direct effect of the withholding tax (external effect) and an indirect effect (internal effect).698 The direct effect of the withholding tax is the normal operation and effect of a tax, in this case the direct appropriation by the State of revenues accruing to CAPSA and CAPEX from the export of crude oil and LPG; while the indirect effect consists in artificially depressing domestic crude oil and LPG price.699\n\nApril Report, \u00a7\u00a7 167 and 169.\n\nThe distinction between direct and indirect effect of the withholding tax is made by the Claimant: \"Export Withholding on crude oil constitute (i) a direct taking of export revenues of CAPSA and CAPEX and (ii) an indirect taking from by artificially depressing domestic crude oil and LPG prices\" (Memorial, \u00a7 474).\n\n727.\n\nThe Tribunal has already excluded its jurisdiction regarding the withholding tax, holding that the tax imposed by Argentina on the export of crude oil and LPG in 2002 and thereafter is a tax measure under Article XII (2) of the BIT.700 The Expert has correctly removed from LECG\u2019s DCF model the direct effect of the withholding tax by excluding from the damages calculation the lost revenues for CAPSA (on crude oil exports) and CAPEX (on crude oil and LPG exports) due to the withholding tax.701\n\n*Supra,* \u00a7\u00a7 281-298.\n\nApril Report, \u00a7 183 and Figure 20 (compared to Figure 19).\n\n728.\n\nThe indirect effect of the withholding tax requires more developments by the Tribunal. The starting point is the precise identification of this effect. This is described as follows by the Claimant:\n\n\"On the other hand, Export Withholdings have the effect of artificially depressing domestic prices for those products that are subject to these levies. This is because the Export Withholdings produce what is known as the \"export parity.\" Buyers in the domestic market will predictably refrain from paying a price to the producer that is higher than the net price the producer would receive (after deducting export costs, including any Export Withholdings) if the product is exported. Consequently, due to the Export Withholdings, CAPSA and CAPEX were forced to accept prices for their domestic sales of crude oil and LPG that were significantly lower than those prices that would have prevailed in the domestic market in the absence of the Export Withholdings.\"702\n\nMemorial, \u00a7 339. Footnotes omitted.\n\n729.\n\nMay the indirect effect of the withholding tax be deemed to fall within the scope of Article XII(2) of the BIT, so that the Tribunal\u2019s lack of jurisdiction extend to any consideration or ruling regarding this effect? The Tribunal believes this to be the case, for the following reasons.\n\n730.\n\nArticle XII(2) of the BIT, when interpreted \"in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\",703 is meant to preserve the State\u2019s sovereign power in \"matters of taxation\", the latter being clearly an attribute of sovereignty. Contracting States agreed therefore to exclude matters of taxation from the system of guarantees and protections of foreign investments established by the BIT in order to preserve their full sovereignty in that regard. This being the object and purpose of Article XII(2), it is for this reason that the Tribunal has declined jurisdiction regarding the withholding tax.704\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 31(1).\n\n*Supra,* \u00a7 289: \"The tax policy of a country is a matter relating to the sovereign power of the State and the State\u2019s power to impose taxes within its territory. The Tribunal must emphasise the sovereign right of a State to enact tax measures it deems appropriate in any particular time.\"\n\n731.\n\nIs the export parity effect described by the Claimant a *\"matter of taxation\"* within the meaning of Article XII(2), interpreted as mentioned above? The answer is in the affirmative. In its ordinary meaning, the expression *\"matters of taxation\"* is not limited to the levy and collection by the State of the specific tax but includes all effects of the tax on the taxpayer. The Tribunal shares the Respondent\u2019s view that not only the withholding tax as such falls within the scope of Article XII(2) of the BIT but also its indirect effects.705\n\nObservations of the Republic of Argentina on Prof. Geoffron\u2019s Report of 1 June 2010, \u00a7 74.\n\n732.\n\nThe export parity effect (the indirect effect of the withholding tax) should therefore be excluded from the damages calculation. Having been so directed by the Tribunal, the Expert, in the October Report, has excluded any withholding tax effects, both local and external.706\n\nOctober Report, Section 4.2 on p. 12 and \u00a7 28. The external effect of the export withholding tax had already been excluded in the April Report.\n\n*(d) The Oil Prices*\n--------------------\n\n733.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided that the valuation standard to be applied for the calculation of El Paso\u2019s damages enables it to consider data and information which became known subsequent to the date of the first GOA measures, 1 January 2002.707 Crude oil prices have been taken into consideration by LECG in the DCF model submitted by the Claimant in support of the claim for damages by using crude oil futures as of 2004708 and as of 2006.709\n\n*Supra,* \u00a7 704.\n\nLECG\u2019s Report, note 373 and \u00a7 191. \"Crude oil prices from August 2004 onwards are forecasted using NYMEX future prices for WTI adjusted by a differential for quality and transportation\" *(ibid.,* \u00a7 194(a)). NYMEX (New York Mercantile Exchange) is the main world market for petroleum futures.\n\nLECG\u2019s Updated Report, \u00a7 210: \"We updated crude oil prices up to September 2006 and from then onwards we use a WTI Future prices that converge to US $ 50 per barrel in 2012.\" Historical price data for WTI (West Texas Intermediate, a type of crude oil) are publicly available.\n\n734.\n\nLECG\u2019s damages assessment based on said crude oil futures is consistent with the valuation standard adopted by the Tribunal to determine the fair market value of El Paso\u2019s investment in the *but for* scenario. Crude oil prices during the period are reported internationally so that a loss of profits based on such prices is financially assessable and not speculative.710\n\n*Supra,* \u00a7 704.\n\n735.\n\nConsistent with the above, the Expert\u2019s reduction of the LECG\u2019s damages assessment by considering only information available in 2002711 was not accepted by the Tribunal. The Expert was directed to prepare two alternative solutions, one applying the 2003 oil prices, the other integrating oil prices to include future prices. The October 2010 Report accordingly presents two different valuations, the first (Valuation 1) applying the \"2003 futures / oil prices\" and the other (Valuation 2) applying oil prices up to 2020, both valuations excluding the withholding tax effects.712\n\nApril Report, \u00a7 209. Figure 26 of the April Report shows the amount of reduction in El Paso\u2019s total damages by considering oil prices in 2003 only.\n\nOctober Report, Sections 3.1 and 4.1.\n\n736.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Valuation 2 is more problematic since it is based on oil prices that, by projecting the calculation up to 2020, make the result financially not assessable on safe grounds, thus providing to be speculative. The Tribunal\u2019s choice is therefore for the more reliable results of Valuation 1.\n\n*(e) The Benefits Accruing to El Paso from the Pesification and Other Measures*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n737.\n\nThe Expert confirms that the positive impact of the pesification has been integrated by LECG in its DCF model,713 adding that this specific issue is not mentioned by Macroconsulting in its Second Report.714 No benefits from other measures are mentioned.\n\nApril Report, \u00a7 218.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00a7221.\n\n738.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that benefits accruing to El Paso as a result of the GOA measures have been duly considered by the Claimant\u2019s expert reports.\n\n*(f) The Value Collected by El Paso for the Sale of the Argentinian Companies*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n739.\n\nBased on LECG\u2019s reports, the total price collected by El Paso for the sale of its interest in Argentina in 2003 is equal to US$ 32.7 million.715 Contrary to the Claimant\u2019s contention,716 the Respondent asserts that there are serious doubts on the price actually received by El Paso and that there is no trace of the 2003 transactions in the DCF damages assessment under LECG\u2019s DCF model.717\n\nLECG\u2019s Report, Exhibit 12 to the Memorial, \u00a7\u00a7 176-177.\n\nCPHB, \u00a7 183.\n\nRPHB, \u00a7 222.\n\n740.\n\nHaving initially considered that the price so collected by El Paso should be deducted from the DCF damages,718 following further analysis the Expert has concluded that the price collected by El Paso for the sale of its participation in the Argentinian companies in 2003 should not be deducted to determine the damages amount since the DCF damages calculation assumes that the Claimant continues to keep its shareholding in said companies.719\n\nApril Report, \u00a7 232.\n\nJuly Report, \u00a7 48.\n\n741.\n\nFollowing the Parties\u2019 observations of 27 December 2010, the Tribunal has requested the Expert to express his final opinion regarding the damages assessment based on Valuation 1. This has led the Expert to recommend to the Tribunal the following modifications to the October Report:\n\n(a) the increase of the damages for CAPSA by US$ 14.2 million by accepting LECG\u2019s suggested correction to withdraw CAPSA\u2019s negative damages;720\n\n(b) the deduction of US$ 2.15 million regarding CAPEX and US$ 0.69 million regarding Costanera, for a total of US$ 2.84 million, suggested by MacroConsulting as correction on the electricity spot prices.721\n\nThe Expert\u2019s recommendations are accepted by the Tribunal.\n\nLECG\u2019s Comments on Prof. Geoffron\u2019s Reports of July and October 2010, Annex A to the Claimant\u2019s letter of 27 December 2010, \u00a7 33 and Table II.\n\nMacroConsulting\u2019s Analysis of the Complementary Note and the Final Revisions of Prof. Geoffron\u2019s Valuation of Damages on the Value of El Paso\u2019s Investments in Argentina of 23 December 2010 attached to Argentina\u2019s Observations on Prof. Geoffron\u2019s Supplementary Report of 27 December 2010, \u00a7 51.\n\n742.\n\nAs a result of all modifications of the initial damages assessment under the April Report accepted by the Tribunal, El Paso\u2019s total damages amount to US$ 43.03 million. The compensation due by Argentina to El Paso is therefore fixed by the Tribunal to the amount of US$ 43.03 million.\n\nC. INTEREST\n-----------\n\n***1. The Parties\u2019 Positions***\n-------------------------------\n\n743.\n\nThe Claimant has requested interest \"at commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation\", as provided by Article IV of the BIT, to be compounded quarterly through the date of the award.722 In reply to the Respondent\u2019s contention that only simple interest should be awarded, the Claimant, referring to LECG, notes that compound interest \"merely reflects the economic reality that a dollar foregone could otherwise have been invested and that income on that investment could have been reinvested so that funds grow at a compound rate.\"723 In its last written submission, the Claimant, relying on the *Enron* award, has requested that interest be awarded at the LIBOR plus 2% rate until the date of payment.724\n\nMemorial, \u00a7\u00a7 629-633.\n\nReply, \u00a7\u00a7 903-904.\n\nCPHB, \u00a7 184.\n\n744.\n\nRelying on the alleged general position of international courts and tribunals as well as of most authors, Argentina has asserted that simple interest should be granted.725\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00a7 820; Rejoinder, \u00a7 640.\n\n***2. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis***\n--------------------------------\n\n745.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that LIBOR plus 2% is the rate of interest used by other awards involving Argentina regarding the same economic crisis as that considered in the present.726 Such a rate appears less speculative than other rates of interest granted by other awards involving Argentina. This rate is, therefore, accepted by this Tribunal.\n\n*Enron, supra* note 52, \u00a7 452; *Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7\u00a7 313-314.\n\n746.\n\nCompound interest is generally recognised by arbitral tribunals in the field of investment protection, including all awards in the Argentine cases.727 The Tribunal shares the view expressed by these awards that compound interest reflects economic reality and will therefore better ensure full reparation of the Claimant\u2019s damage. Interest shall be compounded semi-annually, for the same reason.\n\n*CMS, supra* note 48, \u00a7 471*,* *Azurix, supra* note 50, \u00a7 440; *Enron, supra* note 52, \u00a7 452; *LG&E, supra* note 51, \u00a7 103; *BG, supra* note 293, \u00a7 455; *Continental, supra* note 150, \u00a7 309.\n\n747.\n\nInterest shall run from 1 January 2002, being the date to which the amount of compensation is discounted back in the Expert\u2019s Report, until full payment of the amount due.\n\n**VII. COSTS OF THE PROCEEDING**\n--------------------------------\n\n748.\n\nAccording to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 47(1)(j) of the Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal has to decide, as part of the award, the apportionment of the expenses incurred by the Parties in connection with the proceedings as well as of the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities and services of the Centre.\n\n749.\n\nEach Party has asked the Tribunal that its costs in connection with these proceedings, including the advances made to ICSID for the Centre\u2019s charges and the expenses and fees of the arbitrators, be reimbursed to it by the other Party.728 The Claimant has quantified its costs in the amount of US$ 7,950,823 besides ICSID fees and expenses.729 The Respondent has quantified its costs, net of ICSID fees and expenses, in the amount of US$ 546,456.71.730\n\nCPHB, \u00a7 186(3); RPHB, \u00a7 232.\n\nEl Paso\u2019s letter of 16 June 2011.\n\nArgentina\u2019s letter of 15 June 2011.\n\n750.\n\nThe Convention and the Arbitration Rules give ICSID tribunals broad discretion in awarding costs. The practice in apportioning costs has sometimes followed the principle \"the loser pays\" while in many other cases the decision has been that the Parties were to bear their own costs and share equally the fees and expenses of the arbitrators as well as the charges for the use of the Centre\u2019s facilities and services.\n\n751.\n\nRegarding the present case, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has been successful on the jurisdictional issue but only in part as to the merits of the case and the damages claimed. There are therefore good reasons to decide, as is hereby decided, that each Party shall bear its own costs connected with the proceedings as well as half of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the charges for the use of the Centre\u2019s facilities and services.\n\n**VIII. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n----------------------------------\n\n752.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\nA) Argentina breached Article Il(2)(a) of the BIT by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to El Paso\u2019s investment.\n\nB) Argentina\u2019s defence of necessity to El Paso\u2019s claims is rejected.\n\nC) Within 30 (thirty) days of the date of dispatch to the Parties of this Award, Argentina shall pay to El Paso compensation in the sum of US $ 43.03 million, increased by semi-annually compounded interest on that amount at the rate of LIBOR plus 2% from January 1, 2002 until the date of payment in full of this Award.\n\nD) The Parties shall bear all their own legal costs and expenses, without recourse to each other.\n\nE) The Parties shall bear equally the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID.\n\nAll other claims by either Party are rejected"}, {"Title": "Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2014-09-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Glossary** | |\n| Argentina | Argentine Republic or the Applicant |\n| Argentinian Companies | Compa\u00f1\u00edas Asociadas Petroleras; Capex S.

The **Tribunal** concluded that **Argentina** had breached its obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to **El Paso\u2019s** investment, under the **BIT.**\n\nPresided by Professor Lucius Caflisch (Swiss), appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council, by Prof. Piero Bernardini (Italian), appointed by the Claimant; and Professor Brigitte Stem (French), appointed by the Respondent.\n\n5.\n\nFor the preparation of this decision the Committee reviewed and evaluated all the arguments of the Parties and the documents submitted by them in this proceeding. In making their arguments, the Parties submitted and cited numerous awards and decisions dealing with issues relevant to this decision on annulment. The Committee considered these documents carefully, but obviously the Committee is responsible for deciding on the issue of annulment raised by **Argentina** through an independent analysis of the **ICSID Convention,** the **Arbitration Rules,** and the particular facts of this case, which does not prevent the Committee from taking into consideration the findings of other annulment committees.\n\n6.\n\nIn order to facilitate a better understanding of some of the issues decided by the **Tribunal,** the Committee reproduces the following passages from the **Award:**\n\n\"...the Claimant is an energy company. It alleges that, up until 2003, it owned indirect and non-controlling shareholdings in a number of Argentinian entities: Compa\u00f1\u00edas Asociadas Petroleras (CAPSA) and CAPEX SA (El Paso contends that it held a 45% indirect interest in CAPSA which, in turn, owned 60.36% of the shares of CAPEX); Central Costanera SA (Costanera), in which El Paso claims to have acquired a 12,335% indirect interest; and Gasoducto del Pac\u00edfico SA (Pacifico), in which its indirect interest was said to amount to approximately 13.4% (preferred shares), and 11.8% (ordinary shares) respectively. These four entities have been collectively referred to, in the present proceedings, as the \"Argentinian companies.\" El Paso further alleged an indirect controlling interest (99.92%) in SERVICIOS El Paso, another entity incorporated in Argentina, and a 61.6% interest in the Triunion Energy Company.\"2\n\n\"In April 1997, El Paso acquired, through KLT Power Inc., an indirect noncontrolling shareholding of 12,335% in Costanera. The latter, a local company engaged in the generation and sale of electricity, with a total capacity of 2311 megawatt-hour (MWh), is the largest thermal generator in Argentina.\"3\n\n\"In January 1998, El Paso acquired an indirect non-controlling interest in Pacifico, which owns and operates a natural gas pipeline linking Argentina to the Chilean city of Cochabamba.\"4\n\n\"SERVICIOS was established by El Paso as an Argentinian subsidiary in March 1998 and entered thereafter into an agreement with an Argentinian branch of the Bank of Boston to lease a gas processing plant located on the Agua de Caj\u00f3n field in Neuqu\u00e9n Province. Pursuant to a ten-year gas processing agreement with CAPEX, SERVICIOS transformed gas produced at CAPEX\u2019s facilities into liquid petroleum gas (LPG) by-products that were sold by CAPEX.\"5\n\n\"It is alleged that, from 1997 to 2001, El Paso invested US$336 million in the Argentinian companies, and that its parent company guaranteed around US$24 million of SERVICIOS\u2019 lease obligations. El Paso sold its interest in the companies\u2019 shares in two sales, one in June 2003 - in CAPSA (consequently in CAPEX) and in SERVICIOS - another in October 2003 - in Costanera.\"6\n\nAward, \u00b6 7.\n\nId., \u00b6 10.\n\nId., \u00b6 11.\n\nId., \u00b6 12.\n\nId., \u00b6 13.\n\nII **PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn February 28, 2012, **ICSID** received from **Argentina** an application for annulment and request for stay of enforcement of the Award (the **\"Application\"** and the **\"Request for Stay,\"** respectively).\n\n8.\n\nOn March 7, 2012, pursuant to Rules 50(2)(a) and (b) of the **ICSID Arbitration Rules,** the Secretary General of ICSID registered the **Application** and notified the Parties of the provisional stay of enforcement of the **Award,** pursuant **ICSID Arbitration Rule** 54(2).\n\n9.\n\nOn May 22, 2012, the *ad hoc* Committee was constituted pursuant to Article 52(3) and Rule 6(1) of the **ICSID Arbitration Rules****.**\n\n10.\n\nOn May 22, 2012, the Secretary General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the **ICSID Arbitration Rules** notified the Parties that the three members of the *ad hoc* Committee had accepted their appointments and that the Committee was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. The *ad hoc* Committee is composed of Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno, a national of Costa Rica, President of the Committee; Ms. Teresa Cheng, a national of China; and Prof. Dr. Rolf Knieper, a national of Germany. Ms. Natali Sequeira, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n11.\n\nOn May 31, 2012, the *ad hoc* Committee invited the Parties to file written observations on the Request for Stay, prior to the first session. **Argentina** was invited to submit its observations by June 11, 2012 and **El Paso** by June 22, 2012.\n\n12.\n\nOn May 31, 2012, pursuant to **ICSID Arbitration Rules** Rule 54(2) and the Request **for Stay,** the Committee extended the stay of enforcement of the **Award** until it had heard the Parties and reached a final determination on the continuation of the stay.\n\n13.\n\nOn June 4, 2012, pursuant to Regulation l4(3)(e) of the **ICSID Financial Regulations,** the **Centre** requested the **Argentine Republic** to make a first advance payment of US$225,000 within thirty (30) days to cover the initial costs of the annulment proceedings, including the first meeting of the Parties with the Committee.\n\n14.\n\nAs scheduled, on June 11, 2012 **Argentina** filed its \"Observations on the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\" On June 22, **El Paso** filed its \"Response to Observations of Argentina on the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\"\n\n15.\n\nOn July 10, 2012, the Centre informed the Parties that as of that date the requested payment had not been received, and therefore invited either Party to pay within 15 days.\n\n16.\n\nIn response to the communication referred to in the preceding paragraph, **Argentina** informed the Centre that the Ministry of Economy was processing the advance payment. In view of this information, the Committee confirmed that the first session would be held, as scheduled, by telephone conference.\n\n17.\n\nThe Committee held a first session with the Parties on July 18, 2012 by telephone conference. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Committee had been validly appointed. It was agreed *inter alia* that the applicable **Arbitration Rules** would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural languages would be Spanish and English and that the place of the proceeding would be Washington, D.C. The Parties further agreed on a schedule for the submissions of pleadings on the application for annulment. The agreement of the Parties was embodied in Procedural Order No. 1 dated August 30, 2012 signed by the President and circulated to the Parties.\n\n18.\n\nOn August 13, 2012, **Argentina** stated that the advance payment requested by the Centre had already been processed. The Centre received that payment on August 27, 2012.\n\n19.\n\nOn November 14, 2012 the Committee issued its Decision on Argentina\u2019s Request for Stay of Enforcement of the **Award.** The Committee ordered that the stay of enforcement of the Award be maintained until there was a ruling on the merits of annulment proceedings requested by **Argentina.** That stay was not conditioned on the submission of any kind of guarantee from Argentina.\n\n20.\n\nOn October 5, 2012 **Argentina** submitted its Memorial on Annulment; **El Paso** submitted its Counter-Memorial on Annulment on December 21, 2012; **Argentina\u2019s** Reply on Annulment was submitted on February 21, 2013; **El Paso\u2019s** Rejoinder on Annulment was submitted on May 10, 2013.\n\n21.\n\nThe hearing on annulment was held at the seat of the World Bank in Washington, D.C. on October 8 and 9, 2013.\n\n22.\n\nThe following persons attended the hearing:\n\n*Members o f the ad hoc Committee*\n\nMr. Rodrigo Oreamuno Ms. Teresa Cheng Prof. Dr. Rolf Knieper *Secretary o f the Tribunal*\n\nMs. Natali Sequeira\n\n*For Vinson &Elkins LLP*\n\nMr. James L.

The first for US$225,000, was requested on June 4, 2012 and the second for US$250,000 was requested on June 12, 2013. Both payments were received by the **Centre.**\n\n25.\n\nOn August 19, 2014, the Committee declared the proceeding closed pursuant Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n26.\n\nThe Committee will summarize the position of the Parties on each annulment argument; it will then examine the grounds for annulment under Article 52 of the **ICSID Convention** in relation to these arguments.\n\nIII **POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON THE ALLEGED ANUNULMENT OF THE AWARD**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIn this section the Committee will summarize the arguments for annulment of the **Award** submitted by **Argentina,** pursuant to Article 52 of the **ICSID Convention** and it will summarize the response of **El Paso** to each one of these arguments.\n\n28.\n\n**Argentina** claimed that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers; that the **Award** has failed to state the reasons on which it was based; and that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. It claimed those grounds with regard to: (a) jurisdictional issues; (b) the causal link between the measures adopted by **Argentina** and the sale of **El Paso\u2019s** interest in the Argentine Companies; (c) the measures adopted by **Argentina** in relation to the spot price and the capacity payments; (d) the cumulative effect, determined by the **Tribunal,** of the measures adopted by **Argentina;** and (e) the analysis of the defense of necessity raised by **Argentina** in the arbitration proceeding.\n\nA. **Jurisdictional issues**\n----------------------------\n\n29.\n\nAs described in detail in paragraph 41, **Argentina** divided the issues of this claim as regards \"jurisdictional issues\" and before explaining each issue outlined some general arguments which are summarized below:\n\n30.\n\n**Argentina** stated that **El Paso\u2019s** claim was derivative or indirect, noting that the **Tribunal** held in paragraph 175 of the **Award** that **El Paso\u2019s** contentions in their present form do not seem viable because they amount to claiming twice for damage caused by the same events: once for the taking of the rights of the Argentine Companies and once for the diminution in value of the shares of those companies held by **El Paso.7**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 18.\n\n31.\n\n**Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal** lacked jurisdiction: \"The Tribunal clearly lacks the jurisdiction to amend a claim so as to make it viable because, among other things, this implies rendering an *ultra petita* decision.\"8 Furthermore, **Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal** failed to state the reasons on which its decision was based \"... when it sought to justify the exercise of its jurisdiction by stating that the Treaty grants shareholders a right of direct action.\"9\n\nId., \u00b6 19.\n\nId., \u00b6 26.\n\n32.\n\n**El Paso** stated that **Argentina** was wrong to claim that an *ultra petita* award was rendered because the **Tribunal** did not amend the claims submitted by that company, rather it accepted one of three heads of claim (i.e., El Paso\u2019s claim based on its shareholding in the Argentine Companies) while rejecting others.10\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 58.\n\n33.\n\n**El Paso** concluded that the \"... contended amendment is related to the merits of the dispute which exceeds the limited role of Annulment under Article 52 of ICSID Rules.\"11\n\nId.,\u00b667.\n\n34.\n\nAfter referring to what was said by the **Tribunal** in paragraphs 188, 194, 195, 198 and 214 of the Award as regards what it considered to be investments protected by the **ICSID Convention** and the **BIT, Argentina** stated that the **Tribunal** contradicted itself and manifestly exceeded its powers because in defining investment it ruled that it included the shares of **El Paso** in the Argentine Companies, not the rights and licenses of these companies but, nevertheless, it adopted the damage valuation submitted by LECG **(El Paso\u2019s** damages expert) \"... which implicitly referred to the damage allegedly sustained by the Argentine Companies.\"12\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 21; Award, \u00b6 714.\n\n35.\n\n**El Paso** answered as indicated in the preceding paragraph based on paragraph 206 of the **Award,** in which the **Tribunal** concluded that the method employed by LECG was the most accurate for calculating the damages **Argentina** owed to **El Paso \"...** based on its \u2018right to compensation for loss of value of stocks imputable to measures taken by the host State.\u2019\"13\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 70; Award \u00b6 206.\n\n36.\n\nOn the same issue, **El Paso** stated that the **Tribunal** did not contradict itself and was acting reasonably and within its discretion when it adopted LECG\u2019s DCF method, after duly considering the reports and testimonies of the experts retained by each Party as well as those provided by the **Tribunal\u2019s** appointed expert. **El Paso** also noted that this decision on the merits is not a ground for annulment.14\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 74 and 79.\n\n37.\n\nWith regard to paragraphs 687 and 509 of the **Award,** in which the **Tribunal** stated that the measures taken by **Argentina** were among the reasons that contributed to the damage sustained by **El Paso** in the loss of value of its investment, **Argentina** stated that the **Tribunal** did not provide the reasons for its decision and manifestly exceeded its powers.15\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 22.\n\n38.\n\n**Argentina** also argued that \"... the Tribunal allowed El Paso to bring a claim for contract breaches which, at the same time, purportedly amount to violations of the obligations assumed by Argentina to investors under the BIT.\"16 Therefore, according to **Argentina,** the **Tribunal** allowed a double recovery by the Argentine Companies and **El Paso.** In its Reply on Annulment it indicated that with the decision of the **Tribunal** there had been a manifest excess of powers and failure to state the reasons for its decision.17\n\nId., \u00b6 24.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 11.\n\n39.\n\n**El Paso** stated that the **Tribunal** awarded it damages for its direct claim for the loss in value of its shares in the Argentine Companies, an investment expressly protected under the **BIT.18** It also noted that after a comprehensive analysis, which appears in paragraphs 178 to 214 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** analyzed the issue and concluded that the investment protected by the **BIT,** were the shares in the Argentine Companies.19\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 41.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 45-57.\n\n40.\n\nAfter citing part of paragraph 214 of the **Award, Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal** \"... confuses the legal standing that a shareholder may have, in general terms, to bring a claim under the BIT with the substantial rights arising from its shares.\"20**El Paso** answered this argument by explaining that **Argentina** made an incorrect interpretation of Article I of the **BIT** and that all jurisdictional arguments are based on the merits of the case and not grounds for annulment.21\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 29.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 82-87.\n\n41.\n\nAs noted in paragraph 29 above, **Argentina** divided the claim on jurisdictional issues into various issues: 1. Manifest excess of powers; 2. Failure to provide reasons for the decision; 3. Risk of double recovery in indirect claims; 4. Argentine law does not recognize these types of claims; and 5. General international law does not allow indirect actions to be taken in this case. The Committee will describe in that same order **Argentina\u2019s** arguments and **El Paso\u2019s** response in each case.\n\n**1) Manifest excess of powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n42.\n\n**Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers in exercising jurisdiction over claims filed by **El Paso** since none of the rights held by that company was affected. The measures taken by **Argentina** were in relation to the electricity and the hydrocarbons sector of which the Argentine Companies, and not **El Paso,** were part.22\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 31.\n\n43.\n\nAccording to **Argentina,** the **Tribunal\u2019s** decision to award damages to **El Paso** on the basis of the rights of the Argentine Companies is inconsistent with the **ICSID Convention** and the **BIT** and, with that decision, the **Tribunal** acted beyond the scope of its jurisdiction as set forth in Article 25(2) of the **ICSID Convention****.** It also noted that the **BIT** does not provide for the possibility that a shareholder may bring a claim for the rights of a local company nor does it establish mechanisms to avoid the risk of double claims and double recovery; accordingly, the **Tribunal** has manifestly acted beyond the scope of its competence.23\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 38 and 39.\n\n44.\n\n**El Paso** responded that the position of **Argentina** in stating that shareholders cannot bring claims for damages is contrary to every reported decision of arbitral tribunals concerning this matter. It also reiterated that its claim was a direct claim for the loss in value of its shares in the Argentine Companies.24\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 40 and 41.\n\n**2) Failure to state reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n45.\n\n**Argentina** stated that: \"... in direct opposition to its conclusion that contracts and licenses are not protected investments, the Tribunal awarded damages to El Paso for measures that only affected contracts and licenses belonging to the Argentine Companies.\"25\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 40.\n\n46.\n\n**Argentina** ended this allegation with the following sentence: \"Under the terms of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the Award was based. This failure to state the reasons warrants the annulment of the decision.\"26\n\nId., \u00b6 41; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 21 and 22.\n\n47.\n\n**El Paso** answered the argument of failure to provide reasons as follows:\n\n\"In its Memorial, Argentina employs a handful of artifices to dress up merits as process. First, it seeks to create the illusion that the Award fails *\"to state the reasons on which it is based\"* due to the non-existent contradictions that Argentina attempts to read into it. However, instead of a correct portrayal of the award\u2019s reasoning, Argentina pulls citations out of context, plucking individual phrases hundreds of paragraphs apart, and contrasting them in an attempt to insert a contradiction where none exists.\"27\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 15.\n\n**3) The risk of double recovery in filing indirect claims**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\n**Argentina** stated that one of the main problems posed by admitting this type of indirect claim is the risk of double recovery, which must be avoided through legal considerations that the **Tribunal** is required to establish for these purposes, such as who is the subject of the rights affected, and who is entitled to compensation. According to **Argentina,** the **Tribunal** made no such analysis.28\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 42 and 43.\n\n49.\n\n**El Paso** asserted that based on paragraphs 202 and 214 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** held that **El Paso\u2019s** rights can be ascertained independently from the rights of the Argentine Companies and also, **El Paso** had a direct cause of action under the **BIT** in connection with its investment, according to which the **Tribunal** awarded damages on the basis of a direct claim29\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 43 and 44.\n\n4) **This type of claims are not allowed under Argentine law**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\n**Argentina** asserted that derivative or indirect actions are not provided for under Argentine law (which is the applicable law under Article 42(1) of the **ICSID Convention****).** It added that the Argentine Corporations Law No. 19,550 establishes is the mechanisms available to the board of directors of corporations to file claims on their behalf. That Law also regulates intra-company court actions to which a shareholder might resort to defend the corporation\u2019s interests. These actions tend to protect the corporations as a whole and not a single shareholder such as El Paso.30 It follows from these provisions that El Paso was not entitled to file a claim.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 44-48.\n\n51.\n\n**El Paso** submitted that the **Tribunal** awarded damages not for an alleged \"derivative or indirect\" claim, but instead for its direct claim for the loss of its shares in the Argentine Companies.31\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b64l.\n\n**5) Under general international law indirect actions are not permitted**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\n**Argentina** claimed that under general international law indirect actions, such as those filed by **El Paso,** are not allowed. It based its argument on what the International Court of Justice stated on the matter and noted that the rights claimed by that company are not directly vested in it, but in the Argentine Companies. It also indicated that such derivative actions must be expressly permitted.32\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 49 and 50.\n\n53.\n\nIn conclusion, **Argentina** stated that **El Paso** had no legal standing under the **BIT** to bring an indirect claim.33\n\nId., \u00b6 52.\n\n54.\n\n**El Paso** answered claims 4 and 5 above together; it stated that the **Tribunal** found that **El Paso\u2019s** claims were direct claims and that the *lex specialis* was governed by Article 25 of the **ICSID Convention** and Article I of the **BIT.** Therefore, the requirements for admissibility of derivative claims in international law asserted by **Argentina** are irrelevant. It also stated that this argument is nothing more than an attempt to revisit the **Tribunal\u2019s** decision on jurisdiction.34\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 88-92.\n\n55.\n\n**El Paso** concluded that the jurisdictional arguments of the Memorial on Annulment are an unending discussion of the merits of the case and exceed the limited role of Annulment.35\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 93 and 94.\n\n56.\n\n**Argentina** replied:\n\n\"El Paso is mistaken in attempting to show that *ius standi* is not a relevant criterion for the purposes of annulment. Quite on the contrary, Article 52 of the ICSID Convention allows the annulment of an award to be requested based on any of the grounds provided for therein, which include the manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal. The issue of *ius standi* is closely connected to jurisdiction.\"36\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 30.\n\n57.\n\n**El Paso** reiterated its position, based on a series of arbitral awards, that its claim was not derivative but direct.37\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 9-15.\n\n**B. The causal link between the measures adopted by Argentina and the sale of El Paso\u2019s interest in the Argentine Companies**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\n**Argentina** alleged that the **Tribunal** failed to state the reasons for the **Award,** manifestly exceeded its powers and seriously departed from a rule of procedure when referring to the causal link between the measures adopted by **Argentina** and the sale of **El Paso\u2019s** interest in the Argentine Companies. **Argentina** claimed that during the arbitration proceedings it found out that **El Paso** faced a difficult financial situation and, for that reason, it had engaged in a massive sale of assets all over the world, including in Argentina, where the sole exception to that sale was the Gasoducto del Pac\u00edfico, engaged in the transport of natural gas. **Argentina** cited paragraphs 276 and 277 of the **Award** in which, in its opinion, the **Tribunal** confirmed these claims.38\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 54-59; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 34.\n\n59.\n\nAccording to **Argentina** \"the Tribunal recognized that **it did not find a causal link** between the measures adopted by Argentina and the sale by El Paso of its interest in the Argentine Companies\" (emphasis in the original).39\n\nId., \u00b6 62.\n\n60.\n\n**El Paso** pointed out that **Argentina** failed to cite any evidence to support its assertion in the previous paragraph.40**El Paso** also explained that the Tribunal found \"two different causation standards.\" To evaluate the claim of expropriation and discrimination it used the \"sole cause\" \"test\" or standard (paragraph 270 of the **Award),** and held that no automatic causal link had been recognized by the Tribunal between **Argentina\u2019s** measures and the sale of **El Paso\u2019s** shares. It also noted that the **Tribunal** was careful to point out that its decision on expropriation and the \"sole cause\" test did not deprive **El Paso** of its right to compensation under other BIT standards. **El Paso** added that the other \"test\" was the \"prevailing cause\" test and, after explaining its reasoning in paragraphs 488-509 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** held that **Argentina\u2019s** measures were the prevailing cause of **El Paso\u2019s** sale of its shares in 200341\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 95.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 96-102.\n\n61.\n\n**Argentina** stated in its Reply on Annulment that in the **Award** there is no reference to the \"sole cause\" and the \"prevailing cause\" \"tests\" and that those standards are a construct of **El Paso** with a view to justifying the Tribunal\u2019s failure to state the reasons for the **Award.42**\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 36.\n\n62.\n\n**Argentina** also criticized the fact that, as it stated in the conclusion of paragraph 506 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** referred only to journalistic information presented by **El Paso.43**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 63.\n\n63.\n\n**Argentina** also noted that the conclusion in paragraph 507 of the **Award** is contradictory, provides no reasons for the decision, and violates a fundamental rule of procedure.44\n\nId., \u00b6 64.\n\n64.\n\n**El Paso** contradicted the above statements and asserted that the **Tribunal** provided detailed reasoning for its decision at paragraphs 488 to 509 of the **Award45**\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 102.\n\n65.\n\n**Argentina** also noted an alleged contradiction in paragraph 508 of the **Award** and stated that it is so manifest that it must lead to the annulment of **Award** in full46\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 65.\n\n66.\n\nRegarding the contradiction alleged by **Argentina, El Paso** stated that there was none and that this \"... again is a decision the Tribunal made based on the merits of the case and involves a nuanced weighting of the evidence presented by both parties.\"47 In addition, **El Paso** stated that the **Tribunal** itself answered this claim of **Argentina** in paragraphs 683 and 684 of the **Award** in which reference is made to the alleged failure to find the causal link between the measures taken by **Argentina** and the damage suffered by **El Paso.48**\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 106.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 107 and 108.\n\n67.\n\n**El Paso** concluded that this claim is only **Argentina\u2019s** \"dissatisfaction\" with the analysis and determinations of the **Tribunal49**\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 19.\n\n**C. Measures adopted by Argentina in relation to the spot price and the capacity payments**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nIn order to facilitate an understanding of this argument put forward by **Argentina,** the Committee reproduced the following paragraph of the **Award:**\n\n\"Within the Electricity Regulatory Framework, a competitive system, the Wholesale Electricity Market (WEM), was established in order to organise the sale of energy by its generators. The two markets established within the WEM were: (i) the term market, where producers and buyers could freely agree on sales, conditions and prices; and (ii) the spot market, where energy was supplied, on an hourly basis, for a uniform price linked to the short-term marginal cost of the energy produced.\"50\n\nAward, \u00b6 61.\n\n69.\n\n**Argentina** argued that the \"... only attempt to provide reasons in the ruling [of the Award] is contained in paragraphs 512-514.\"51 It also stated that the **Tribunal** analyzed separately each measure adopted by **Argentina** in the electricity sector and did not find any violation of the rights of **El Paso.** The **Tribunal** stated that there was no concession contract embodying a stabilization clause and no contract with the State resulting in rights capable of being invoked by **El Paso. Argentina** cited the **Tribunal\u2019s** conclusions expressed in paragraphs 416 and 419 of the **Award,** in relation to the measures taken by **Argentina** to adapt the functioning of the WEM, noting that capacity payments were subject to regulation by the Secretary of Energy. **Argentina** also stated that with regard to the setting of the spot price and the seasonal price the **Tribunal** did not find that such changes were unfair and inequitable. It referred specifically to paragraph 422 of the **Award** in which the **Tribunal** stated that none of the measures adopted in the electricity sector \"is considered, *per se,* as a violation of the WEM, nor a violation of FET.\"52\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 70.\n\nId., \u00b6 80.\n\n70.\n\nNevertheless, according to **Argentina,** these findings were contradicted with no basis by the **Tribunal** itself in paragraph 512 of the **Award** without any reasons being provided. \"No reasons are stated and no evidence is mentioned in order to justify the assertion that \u2018the very reason\u2019 for the capacity payments was \u2018to attract investment.\u2019\"53**Argentina** also noted a contradiction between the assertions outlined in the previous paragraph and paragraph 514 of the **Award.** \"The Tribunal fails to explain why a commitment allegedly made \u2018towards the companies in which El Paso invested\u2019\u2014which according to the Tribunal itself, are neither investors nor investments protected under the Treaty\u2014may be invoked by El Paso. The failure by the Tribunal to state the reasons on which its decision was based is self-evident.\"54\n\nId., \u00b6 81.\n\nId., \u00b6 82.\n\n71.\n\n**Argentina** concluded that the contradictory conclusions and unfounded statements that it had pointed out constitute sufficient grounds for the annulment of the **Award** since they amount to a failure to state reasons, a manifest excess of powers and a serious departure from a rule of procedure.55\n\nId.,\u00b683.\n\n72.\n\n**El Paso** said that **Argentina** was only trying to re-open the findings of the **Tribunal** and \"disguise as a request for annulment an appeal of the Award.\"56\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 141.\n\n73.\n\n**El Paso** denied that the **Tribunal\u2019s** reasoning was contained only in paragraphs 512 and 514. It noted that the issue of fair and equitable treatment was analyzed by the **Tribunal** from paragraph 330; first it analyzed the measures individually and then as a whole. **El Paso** noted that in paragraphs 510-512 the **Tribunal** did not analyze **Argentina\u2019s** measures individually, but the legal framework in general.57\n\nId., \u00b6 147.\n\n74.\n\n**El Paso** added that these complaints by **Argentina** are an attempt to discuss issues of fact and the application of law by the **Tribunal.** It also stated that in making the argument of lack of reasoning it ignores the reasoning contained in over two hundred paragraphs in the **Award.58**\n\nId., \u00b6 148.\n\n75.\n\n**Argentina** did not address this issue in its Reply on Annulment and **El Paso** only indicated in its Rejoinder on Annulment that it is confident that simply by reading the Committee will conclude that **Argentina\u2019s** arguments are without merit.59\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 25.\n\n**D. The cumulative effect of the measures adopted by the Argentine Republic**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\n**Argentina** stated that:\n\n\"...the Tribunal created a new standard, as if it had the power to create law or to modify the BIT, and applied it to the facts of the case. Indeed, according to the Tribunal, \u2018in the same way as one can speak of *creeping expropriation,* there can also be creeping violations of the FET standard.\u2019 This is unprecedented in the history of investment arbitration and is the reason why the Tribunal could not cite even a single international rule, arbitral decision or paper by a legal author mentioning this new concept of creeping violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, which was invented by the Tribunal. Hence, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by seeking to create a rule referring to a new way of violating the standard of fair and equitable treatment that was not provided for by the parties to the Treaty.(emphasis in the original)\"60\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 85.\n\n77.\n\n**Argentina** further asserted that the Tribunal resorted to Article 15 of **the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles** which contains the concept of composite acts. However\u2014according to **Argentina\u2014** for such a composite act to exist, there must be a primary rule providing that \"... an accumulation of certain (lawful or wrongful) acts entails the breach of a new obligation,\" which, according to **Argentina,** is not the case here.61 In its Reply on Annulment, **Argentina** added that it never had the opportunity to present arguments against the existence of an alleged \"composite act\" within the meaning of Article 15 of **the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles.62**\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 87 and 88; Reply on Annulment, \u00b649.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 47.\n\n78.\n\n**Argentina** noted that the **BIT** \"...does not contain a standard condemning the performance of a series of lawful acts or the commission of creeping violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard and the Tribunal lacks the legislative capacity to create it.\" It also stated that there was no evidence whatsoever that Argentina and the United States intended to establish a type of composite fair and equitable treatment, and therefore the **Tribunal** did not resort to the applicable law, but to a different law it created by itself.63\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 89.\n\n79.\n\n**Argentina** indicated that the doctrine of composite act refers to a series of conducts and the intent to cause damage as elements thereof; however, in this case the **Tribunal** found that there was no intention to cause damage and, \"as a result, on the basis of this line of reasoning, the use of the concept of composite acts is not admissible either.\"64\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 93- 95.\n\n80.\n\n**Argentina** argued that allowing a tribunal to punish a State for adopting a series of lawful measures which, taken together, allegedly amount to a wrongful act affects legal certainty and constitutes both a manifest excess of powers and a serious departure from the rules of procedure. It also claimed that the **Tribunal** violated the guarantee of due process and the right to defense because **Argentina** did not have the opportunity to defend itself against this position (cumulative effect) at any stage of the proceedings.65\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 96 and 97.\n\n81.\n\n**Argentina** argued that when there is a wrongful application of the law, and it is egregious (as in this case), this is considered to be a ground for annulment. It added that \"what the Tribunal did here was not to misinterpret an Article of the BIT, but to modify its content, thus turning it into a rule that provides for composite acts, which amounts to a manifest excess of its powers.\"66\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 55.\n\n82.\n\n**Argentina** concluded this allegation as follows:\n\n\"...the Tribunal\u2019s \u2018judicial creation,\u2019 which jeopardizes legal certainty\u2014not only in this case, but also in future proceedings if this theory starts to be followed by other tribunals\u2014amounts to a manifest excess of the powers of the Tribunal, a failure to state the reasons on which the decision was based, and a serious departure from the rules of procedure, which warrants the annulment of the Award.\"67\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 101.\n\n83.\n\nAccording to **El Paso,** the **Tribunal** did not commit any error likely to cause the annulment of the **Award** when it ruled that the cumulative effect of the measures violated the standard of fair and equitable treatment. It cited paragraph 517 of the **Award** to assert that the **Tribunal** explained how it viewed \"...Argentina\u2019s wholesale dismantling of the legal framework in the electricity market, not just individual, incremental changes in the regulatory scheme.\"68\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 113.\n\n84.\n\nAccording to **El Paso,** the **Tribunal** did not create any new standard, but made an analogy between Argentina's actions that supposedly violated the **FET** standard and to creeping expropriation to explain its decision. It added that even if the **Tribunal** had misinterpreted the FET standard it would merely have been a misapplication of law and not been a ground for annulment.69 It also stated that the **BIT** did not contain a definition for the fair and equitable treatment standard because the signatory States of that treaty did not agree on a definition; so the **Tribunal** had to analyze it in order to define it and apply it to the facts of the case.70\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 114 and 118.\n\nId., \u00b6 119.\n\n85.\n\n**El Paso** also argued that in all the memorials the Parties discussed the concept of fair and equitable treatment relative to the complete regulatory framework. It denied that **Argentina** did not have the opportunity to defend itself against those arguments.71\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 117.\n\n86.\n\n**El Paso** also stated, based on several quotes from other awards, that the **Tribunal** did not elaborate a new standard.72 It also criticized **Argentina\u2019s** arguments in relation to the reference made by the **Tribunal** to Article 15 of **the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles,** since the latter are secondary rules, cited by the **Tribunal** as a reference point in its interpretation of the proper law, the **BIT.73**\n\nId., \u00b6 122.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 124 and 126; Post-Hearing Counter-Submission - Argentina, \u00b6 44.\n\n87.\n\n**El Paso** cited several paragraphs of the \"Claimant\u2019s Memorial,\" the \"Claimant\u2019s Reply,\" the \"Claimant\u2019s Statement\" submitted on the first day of the hearing and the \"Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder\" as a basis for its claim that in the proceedings there was indeed reference to \"... the legal regime... in terms of a composite regime...\"74\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 129.\n\n88.\n\nBased on the *Kl\u00f4ckner v. Cameroon* case,75**El Paso** argued that an arbitral tribunal is entitled to formulate its own argument so long as that argument does not go beyond the legal framework established by the Parties; in its opinion, the **Tribunal** did not exceed this framework.76 For **El Paso,** the **Tribunal** did not fail to state its reasons nor was its reasoning contradictory concerning the cumulative effects of the measures adopted by **Argentina** which violated the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH et al. v. Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2 [hereinafter \" *Kl\u00f4ckner\"],* Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Arbitral Award, May 3, 1985.\n\nId., \u00b6 131.\n\n89.\n\n**Argentina** referred at length to the previous issue and concluded that \"... there is no doubt that the Tribunal that ruled on this case went beyond the legal framework established by the parties.\"77\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 59.\n\n90.\n\nAt the end of the hearing on October 8 and 9, 2013, the Committee asked the Parties to clarify several issues. Specifically, it asked **El Paso** to indicate:\n\n\"... why it states that Argentina was aware, from the beginning, about El Paso\u2019s claim that the violations caused by the measures taken by Argentina, while they did not violate the FET standard individually, when considered cumulatively, qualify as violations of the FET and was, thus, in a position to defend itself, during the arbitration proceeding, from the consequences of such claim.\"78\n\nLetter from the Secretary of the Committee dated October 11, 2013.\n\n91.\n\nThe Committee also granted **Argentina** time so it could discuss the response it would provide to **El Paso.** Subsequently, the parties submitted additional observations in a second round of memorials. In the following paragraphs the Committee will summarize the positions expressed in these briefs.\n\n92.\n\n**El Paso** stated that its claim of unfair and inequitable treatment was based on a cumulative basis and maintained that the opinions of **Argentina\u2019s** own expert witnesses show that they were instructed to defend the claims on a cumulative basis.79 It added that, even if **Argentina** did somehow fail to understand the case it had to meet, it managed to serve the appropriate evidence it deemed necessary \"and so any different understanding would not have produced any substantially different result.\"80**El Paso** also stated that there is no \"legal standard of composite acts,\" that the \"legal standard\" is \"treatment\" and the **Tribunal** interpreted the term \"fair and equitable treatment\".81 For **El Paso,** how **Argentina** chose to present its case was Argentina\u2019s advocacy choice and this Committee should not allow Argentina to re-cast such tactical choice.82\n\nPost-Hearing Brief-El Paso, \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 8.\n\nId., \u00b6 9.\n\nId.,\u00b6 11.\n\nId., \u00b6 18\n\n93.\n\nAccording to **El Paso,** \"the Tribunal was free to interpret \u2018treatment\u2019 in Article II (2)(a) of the BIT as comprising all measures, considered collectively or on an individual basis.\" \"The BIT does not define what \u2018treatment\u2019 must be for FET, and it in no way excludes the possibility that the primary rule may be violated by multiple. acts.83\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 37 and 38; Post- Hearing Reply - El Paso, \u00b6\u00b6 13 and 14.\n\n94.\n\n**El Paso** also indicated that, based on what was said by the Annulment Committee in the *Wena v. Egypt* case,84 in order for the departure from a fundamental rule of procedure to be a ground of annulment it must be serious, and the applicant must show that the departure substantially affected the outcome of the case. It alleges that **Argentina** failed to do so.85\n\n*Wena Hotels LTD. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, [hereinafter *\"Wena Hotels\"]* Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Arbitral Award, February 5, 2002.\n\nPost-Hearing Brief - El Paso, \u00b6 42.\n\n95.\n\n**El Paso** cited several paragraphs of the various pleadings filed by the Parties during the arbitration process and the reports of the experts offered by both Parties, whereby in its opinion it is shown that from the beginning of the proceedings it filed a claim based on the cumulative effect of the measures.86\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 54-70.\n\n96.\n\nAccording to **El Paso,** through its submissions during the proceedings, **Argentina** defended the measures it adopted, individually and collectively. It did this when it described the context in which the measures and the electricity and hydrocarbons regulatory frameworks in general were adopted at a time of crisis in that country.87\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 71-89.\n\n97.\n\n**El Paso** referred to other documents in which **Argentina** recognized that there could not be an isolated analysis of the measures challenged in the arbitral process and further argued that **El Paso** had alleged violation of the **BIT** because of a set of measures taken by the Argentine government.88 It also claimed that even at the hearing it was demonstrated that \"the cumulative FET issue was in play\"89 when, for example, in the examination of experts provided by the Parties, the latter indicated that they had analyzed all the measures as a package, and the cumulative effect of these measures.90\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 94 and 95.\n\nId., \u00b6 101.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 102-104.\n\n98.\n\nRegarding the term \"treatment,\" **Argentina** stated that the **Award** did not relate the meaning of that term to Article Il(2)(a) of the **BIT;** it further argued that the **Award** mentions the concept of \"composite act\" only in the title and at the end of paragraph 51991\n\nPost-Hearing Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 14 and 15.\n\n99.\n\nFurthermore, **Argentina** contended that the \"Claimant never argued, not even in the alternative, that the measures at issue, *while they did not violate the FET standard individually,* amounted to a breach of that standard when considered cumulatively\" (emphasis in the original).92\n\nPost-Hearing Counter-Submission - Argentina, \u00b6 2.\n\n100.\n\n**Argentina** also referred to the terms \"composite act\" and \"creeping violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment,\" describing concepts \"... which came as an unpleasant surprise in the Award. Be that as it may, it should be noted that El Paso was also unable to rely on any other reason, concept or theory it had invoked in its submissions to the Tribunal, to try and argue that each of the measures at issue in isolation *did not breach the FET* standard but should otherwise be considered a breach of FET.\"93 (emphasis in the original)\n\nId., \u00b6 4.\n\n101.\n\n**El Paso** rejected **Argentina\u2019s** contention as follows:\n\n\"...mere surprise at the Tribunal\u2019s decision does not entitle Argentina to annulment. Argentina has the additional burden of showing that the alleged error substantially affected the outcome of the case.\"94\n\nPost-Hearing Reply, \u00b6 49.\n\n102.\n\nFor **Argentina,** \"[t]he claim presented was about individual breaches of the Argentina-US BIT and about an *accumulation of breaches,* never about an accumulation of lawful acts that somehow tum[ed] into an illegal act.\"95 (emphasis in the original). Moreover, in its opinion, the problem is that **El Paso** never argued the \"\u2019cumulative effect\u2019 of lawful acts.\"96\n\nPost-Hearing Rejoinder, \u00b6 6.\n\nId.,\u00b6 13.\n\n103.\n\n**Argentina** also stated:\n\n\"Suffice it to mention only some of the issues Argentina was never able to discuss or even raise before the Award was rendered:  \n Which lawful acts can be considered in the \"accumulation\" of measures and which cannot?  \n If the series in question is not just an accumulation of BIT breaches but of lawful acts, does the \"cumulative effect\" of the measures suffice to conclude that there has been a composite wrongful act, or in this case does the latter concept require some other factor that links all the acts?  \n Should the fact that each and every measure, when considered individually, does not breach the BIT have an impact on, for example, the calculation of damages?  \n Given that all of the measures individually considered do not breach the BIT, what should be the date of valuation for damage calculation purposes?\"97\n\nPost-Hearing Counter-Submission - Argentina, \u00b6 14.\n\n104.\n\n**Argentina** argued that El Paso analyzed the measures in question one by one and maintains that each of them violated the standard of fair and equitable treatment.98 It also stated that \"... the Tribunal never indicated, much less \"clearly,\" that it had concerns about each measure being, in isolation, consistent with the FET but in breach of such standard when considered collectively.\"99 It concluded that **Argentina** had no opportunity to present written and oral presentations on that concept which **El Paso** did not raise.100\n\nId., \u00b6 29.\n\nId., \u00b6 43.\n\nId.,\u00b643.\n\n105.\n\nAccording to **El Paso,** the **Tribunal\u2019s** decision on the issue of whether the various measures adopted by **Argentina** were arbitrary and discriminatory has no bearing on the determination of the total effect of these measures as unfair and inequitable treatment.101**El Paso** also argued that **Argentina** failed to demonstrate that if the concept of the violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment in a cumulative manner had not been raised in the arbitration process, this fact would have affected the final outcome.102\n\nPost-hearing Reply, \u00b6 19.\n\nId., \u00b6 31.\n\n106.\n\n**Argentina** insisted that the concepts of composite act and creeping violation of the FET standard first appeared in the **Award,** therefore it did not have the opportunity to challenge such arguments.103 It was not allowed to discuss whether it is possible that the concept of composite act may be said to be contained in the **BIT,** the conditions for the application of these concepts, or the consequences of their application in terms of liability and in terms of damages.104\n\nPost-Hearing Rejoinder, \u00b6 2.\n\nId.,\u00b63.\n\n107.\n\n**Argentina** also questioned paragraphs 459 and 515 of the **Award,** for, in its opinion, there is a contradiction between them with reference to the effects of pesification in the Argentine Companies. It also noted that the Award must be annulled for manifest excess of powers because the **Tribunal** could not conclude that the **BIT** was violated by measures that were not subject to the jurisdiction of the **Tribunal.** It noted also that the use of \"etc.\" in paragraph 515 of the **Award** demonstrates the failure to state the reasons for the decision since one cannot conclude precisely which measures were considered by the **Tribunal.105**\n\nPost-Hearing Counter-Submission - Argentina, \u00b6 13; Post-Hearing Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 27 and 28.\n\n**E. The necessity defenses raised by the Argentine Republic**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nRegarding the defense of necessity, **Argentina** stated that the **Tribunal** did not apply Article XI of the **BIT** which contains the so-called \"non-precluded measures provision.\" According to **Argentina,** that Article does not contain the \"noncontribution\" requirement and the fact that the **Tribunal** considered applying it with a view to excluding the application of this rule, constituted a failure to rely on the applicable law.106**Argentina** also stated that the **Tribunal** was not consistent and extrapolated the requirements laid down in other instruments absolutely inapplicable to this case,107 and furthermore the **Tribunal** wrongly equated the \"non-contribution\" requirement to the \"state of necessity\" when, in fact, they are different.108\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 106 and 107.\n\nId., \u00b6 139.\n\nId., \u00b6 140.\n\n109.\n\n**Argentina** also argued that the **Tribunal** did not address the defense that it filed of state of necessity under customary international law independently of Article XI of the **BIT,** which was inconsistent with the analysis made by the **Tribunal** in the **Award.** It indicated that there are differences between Article XI of the **BIT** and Article 25 of the **ILC\u2019s Draft Articles** on the sphere of application of these rules, their nature, operation, content, and scope.109\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 109-123.\n\n110.\n\nOnce **Argentina** explained the differences identified, it stated that it demonstrated in the arbitral proceedings that Article XI of the **BIT** is a self-judging provision, i.e., that the **BIT** Contracting State has the right to interpret that rule. It referred to the evidence it brought to the proceedings in this matter and stated that the **Tribunal \"...-** acting in a purely arbitrary manner and manifestly exceeding its powers - did not mention, let alone take into account, such critical piece of evidence *submitted in the course of these arbitration proceedings,* in unjustifiably rejecting the self-judging nature of the provision, disregarding what had been clearly acknowledged by both parties to the BIT.\"110 (emphasis in the original)\n\nId., \u00b6 127.\n\n111.\n\n**Argentina** also argued that the **Tribunal** did not explain why the term \"essential security interests\" in Article XI of the **BIT** should be limited to matters of external security instead of including internal security issues, especially in a crisis such as the one experienced by Argentina.111\n\nId., \u00b6 128.\n\n112.\n\n**Argentina** also argued that the **Tribunal** did not state reasons and manifestly exceeded its powers when it reached its conclusion in paragraph 591 of the **Award.** For **Argentina,** what was done by the **Tribunal** amounts to non-application of the applicable law.\n\n113.\n\n**Argentina** alleged a failure to state reasons, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, and a manifest excess of powers in relation to the **Tribunal\u2019s** statement that, unless the contrary is specified, the provisions of the **BIT** are not self-judging in nature, because according to **Argentina,** in the conclusion expressed in paragraphs 590 and 610 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** disregarded the evidence submitted by Argentina.112\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 132 and 142.\n\n114.\n\nRegarding the same issue, **Argentina** stated that the **Tribunal \"...** refers in general terms to the alleged object and purpose of the Treaty, without even considering critical and irrefutable evidence that demonstrates that the intention of the parties to the BIT is wholly inconsistent with its proposition.\"113\n\nId., \u00b6 135.\n\n115.\n\n**Argentina** also pointed out that the statement made by the **Tribunal** in paragraph 603 of the **Award,** in which reference was made to Argentina\u2019s knowledge of the self-judging nature of Article XI of the **BIT** is unfounded and inconsistent with the evidence contained in the record.114\n\nId., \u00b6 138.\n\n116.\n\nIn addition, according to **Argentina,** the **Tribunal** did not apply Article IV(3) of the **BIT** because the **Tribunal** reached the conclusion that this rule would have no effect; in addition, no reasons were given for that decision, and therefore this amounted to the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeding its powers.115\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 143 and 144.\n\n117.\n\n**Argentina** further argued that there is an inconsistency in the **Award** because the majority of the **Tribunal** held that **Argentina** had not met the \"non-contribution\" requirement and did not indicate what legal standard it analyzed in order to demand that requirement. **Argentina** ended this argument as follows:\n\n\"...the majority [of the Tribunal] did not state the reasons on which that part of the Award was based, failed to explain the legal standards applied by it \u2014particularly, the meaning ascribed to \u2018non-contribution\u2019 in adopting its criterion\u2014 and referred only to economic (rather than legal) arguments).\"116\n\nId., \u00b6 157.\n\n118.\n\n**El Paso** contended that **Argentina** did not link its arguments in this section with the grounds for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. It considered that the **Tribunal,** by invoking the \"non-contribution\" requirement from Article 25 of **the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles** was interpreting the \"necessity\" language of Article XI of the **BIT;** that its reasoning was adequate and it applied the proper law.117\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 155.\n\n119.\n\nRegarding customary international law, **El Paso** stated that tribunals have discretion as to how to express the reasons for their decisions. In the **Award,** the **Tribunal** gave a lengthy explanation of the scope of Article XI with respect to the requirements of international law; it also established that the *lex specialis* was Article XI and, after stating that **Argentina** failed to meet the \"non-contribution\" requirement, the Tribunal did not analyze the other requirements of Article 25 of the **ILC\u2019s Draft** **Articles. El Paso** concluded that the truth is that **Argentina** does not agree with the reasoning and the conclusions of the **Tribunal.118**\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 165-166.\n\n120.\n\nRegarding the self-judging nature of Article XI of the **BIT, El Paso** stated that **Argentina** was claiming that the Committee should re-examine the evidence received regarding this issue. It further argued that **Argentina** could not prove that at the time of signing of the **BIT,** there was a bilateral understanding on the self-judging nature of that standard. It also alleged that, although the **Tribunal** did not specifically refer to the evidence presented by **Argentina,** it gave sufficient reasons for it to be understood why it would not consider it relevant or decisive.119\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 173-177.\n\n121.\n\n**El Paso** stressed that the **Award** is not annullable because **Argentina** does not share the **Tribunal\u2019s** position on the relevance of the evidence and it reiterated that, under Rule 34(1) of the **ICSID Arbitration Rules** the **Tribunal** has wide latitude with regard to the weighing of evidence.120\n\nId., \u00b6 178.\n\n122.\n\nRegarding Article IV(3) of the **BIT, El Paso** stated that the **Tribunal** explained the position of the parties on this standard and, in paragraph 559 of the **Award,** concluded that **Argentina\u2019s** argument in this regard went against the plain meaning of the text and explained its position. For **El Paso, Argentina\u2019s** claim is nothing more than its dissatisfaction with the **Tribunal\u2019s** decision.121\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 181-184.\n\n**F. Issues related to the valuation of damages**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\n**Argentina** argued that the amount of compensation awarded by the **Tribunal** is contrary to applicable law and that there was manifest excesses of powers on the part of the **Tribunal** in this matter. It indicated that, in terms of causality, there was a failure to give reasons for decisions and manifest excess of powers because the proper law was not applied.122 According to **Argentina, El Paso** did not invoke the cumulative effects of the measures and, therefore, the **Tribunal** must conclude that the valuation carried out by **El Paso\u2019s** experts cannot be deemed to satisfy the causation requirement. The valuation considered by the **Tribunal** was done by LECG which made the valuation of damages for each measure, not by accumulation thereof. **Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal** did not observe the \"test\" of causality in relation to **El Paso\u2019s** sale of shares in the Argentine Companies.123\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 163.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 158-168; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 117.\n\n124.\n\n**Argentina** also claimed that the **Tribunal** used the information in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case124 in terms of the compensation standard, however case law is not a source of law in international arbitration. In addition there was contradiction in applying the findings of *Chorz\u00f3w* because in that case it was a dispossession of an industrial enterprise, whereas this is not a case of expropriation; thus, the **Award** is contradictory.125\n\n*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* (Germany v. Poland) [hereinafter *\"Chorz\u00f3w\"],* 1927 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 9 (July 26)\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 169-170; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 123.\n\n125.\n\n**Argentina** also stated that the **Tribunal** \"in blatant contradiction with this approach, by a majority decision, and manifestly exceeding its powers, adopted a valuation taking values projected in 2003, after the alleged breaches by Argentina, placing El Paso in a different situation than that existing before the alleged \u2018creeping measures.'\"126\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 171.\n\n126.\n\nFor **Argentina,** the compensation ordered by the **Tribunal** is disproportionate and arbitrary. In addition, in determining the amount of damages, the **Tribunal** did not take into account the sales price of **El Paso\u2019s** shareholding but rather adopted a method that assumed that **El Paso** continues to keep those shares. According to **Argentina,** these contradictions are evidence of the **Tribunal\u2019s** failure to state the reasons on which the decision is based.127\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 173-174.\n\n127.\n\n**Argentina** concluded as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal held Argentina liable for the violation of a standard that is not contained in the Treaty and then awarded damages to Claimant relying on a damage assessment that was based on alleged BIT violations that are different from those invoked by Claimant. In deciding on issues that had not been submitted to it, the Tribunal seriously violated Argentina\u2019s right of defence.\"128\n\nId., \u00b6 177.\n\n128.\n\n**El Paso** pointed out that arbitral tribunals have a discretionary power to set the amount of damages. It also noted that the argument that the **Tribunal** misapplied the law is an insufficient ground for annulment. According to **El Paso, Argentina** does not challenge the application of the proper law but essentially disagrees with the **Tribunal\u2019s** findings on damages. **El Paso** insisted that the **Tribunal** analyzed the valuation mechanisms presented by the Parties and took into account LECG\u2019s DCF model endorsed by the **Tribunal\u2019s** independent expert.129\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 188, 190-191.\n\n129.\n\nRegarding the reference by the **Tribunal** to the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case for the adoption of the standard of compensation, **El Paso** explained that since the **BIT** does not specify the applicable standard, the Tribunal looked to that case to determine the standard. **El Paso** also indicated that, based on the decision of *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. y Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentina130* and what was expressed by Professor Christoph Shreuer, an arbitral tribunal need not explicitly address every single detail of what was argued by the parties. The Tribunal is afforded discretion as to the way in which it expresses its reasoning in fixing damages whether it is stated succinctly or at length.131\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux) v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3 [hereinafter *\"Vivendi E],* Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 197-198.\n\n130.\n\n**El Paso** acknowledged that case law is not a source of law, but noted that the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* judgment is part of customary international law and a general principle of international law that has been considered as the cornerstone of compensation claims.\n\n131.\n\nRegarding the application of the *Chorz\u00f3w* standard and dispossession of an industrial undertaking, which did not happen in this case, **El Paso** stated that in paragraph 702 of the **Award** the **Tribunal** explained the reason why it applied that standard to a situation such as this, which involves the breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, as other Tribunals have done.132\n\nId. \u00b6\u00b6 199- 200.\n\n132.\n\nRegarding the use of prices projected in 2003, **El Paso** stated that the **Tribunal** explained in paragraphs 704 and 733 to 736 its reasons for applying these projected values. It also emphasized the discretion enjoyed by the Tribunal in this matter. Here again this is not an issue of manifest excess of powers, but of **Argentina\u2019s** dissatisfaction with the **Tribunal\u2019s** findings.133\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 201- 202; Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 83.\n\n133.\n\nRegarding the sale price of the shares and **Argentina\u2019s** contention that the **Tribunal** assumed that **El Paso** kept those shares and that that is a contradiction so as to form a basis for annulment of the **Award, El Paso** indicated, based on several annulment decisions, that the Committees should be extremely careful when reviewing allegations of alleged contradictions in awards. It also analyzed the cost reports provided by the arbitration records and the analysis submitted by the **Tribunal\u2019s** own expert and denied that there was any contradiction in this case.134\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 204- 208.\n\n134.\n\n**El Paso** alleged that **Argentina** is seeking to reopen the merits of this dispute and wishes the Committee to be converted into an appellate tribunal. It added that **Argentina\u2019s** assertion that it was denied procedural rights is unfounded. According to **El Paso,** the **Award** contains a proper application of the law and a thoughtful, well-reasoned, and calculated weighing of the factual evidence. It does not involve any excess of power by the **Tribunal** or serious departure from the fundamental rules of procedure. For these reasons, it requested the rejection of the alleged grounds for annulment and application for annulment; confirmation of the Tribunal\u2019s Award; and an order that **Argentina** pay costs.135\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 209-211.\n\nIV **ANALYSIS OF THE COMMITTEE**\n--------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Committee carefully considered the claim for annulment brought by **Argentina.** In its submissions, **Argentina** presented three grounds which the Committee summarized in the previous section. If the Committee were to analyze these grounds in the same order in which they were presented, there would be unnecessary repetition, as **Argentina** split its arguments on each ground into several sections. For this reason, in the chronology set out below, the Committee will follow the order in which Article 52(1) of the **ICSID Convention** provides the grounds for annulment applicable to the case.\n\n136.\n\nIn order to fully understand **Argentina\u2019s** claim and the position of **El Paso** in this annulment proceeding, the Committee believes it is convenient to reproduce the following rules:\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention lists the grounds for annulment as follows:\n\n\"(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:\n\n(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;\n\n(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or\n\n(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\"\n\nArticle IV(3) of the BIT states:\n\n\"Nationals or companies of either Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency, insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded treatment by such other Party no less favorable than that accorded to its own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the more favorable treatment, as regards any measures it adopts in relation to such losses.\"\n\nArticle XI of the BIT provides:\n\n\"This Treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the Protection of its own essential security interests\".\n\n137.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, the Committee will review the allegations raised by **Argentina** corresponding to those which are exhaustively listed in Article 52 of the **ICSID Convention****;** the remaining allegations, which do not refer to the grounds for annulment, will be rejected without any analysis.\n\nA. **Manifest excess of powers**\n--------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe manifest excess of powers of an arbitral tribunal may take place when a Tribunal is resolving jurisdictional issues or issues concerning the merits of the case. This can happen when a tribunal rules on matters that the parties did not submit for its decision; when it did not to apply the proper law; or when it did not apply the law agreed on by the parties. In these cases, the excess of powers must be \"manifest.\"\n\n139.\n\nThe Committee considers it important to highlight the following:\n\n\"...Ad *hoc* Committees have acknowledged the principle specifically provided by the Convention that the Tribunal is the judge of its own competence. This means that the Tribunal has the power to decide whether it has jurisdiction to hear the parties\u2019 dispute based on the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement and the jurisdictional requirements in the ICSID Convention. In light of this principle, the drafting history suggests\u2014and most *ad hoc* Committees have reasoned\u2014that in order to annul an award based on a Tribunal\u2019s determination of the scope of its own jurisdiction, the excess of powers must be \"manifest.\" However, one *ad hoc* Committee found that an excess of jurisdiction or failure to exercise jurisdiction is a manifest excess of powers when it is capable of affecting the outcome of the case.\"136\n\nBackground Paper on the Annulment Mechanism for the ICSID Administrative Council, August 10, 2012, \u00b689.\n\n140.\n\n\"Manifest excess of power\" has been defined as that which is obvious, clear, or self-evident; discernible without the need for elaborate interpretations.137 However, for some *ad hoc* committees that concept is more complex; e.g., for the committee in the *Fraport* case manifest excess must be demonstrable and substantial and not lead to doubt. That committee said: \"The Committee considers that the excess of jurisdiction should be demonstrable and substantial and not doubtful.\"138 \"It seems to this Committee that a manifest excess of power implies that the excess of power should at once be textually obvious and substantially serious\".139\n\n*Wena Hotels,* Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Arbitral Award, February 5, 2002 \u00b6 25; *Azurix Corp. v.

United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision on Annulment, June 5, 2007, \u00b6 40.\n\n141.\n\nThe Committee considers that not every excess of powers may result in the annulment of an award because, in accordance with Article 52 of the **ICSID Convention****,** an award may be annulled only if the excess of powers is \"manifest.\"\n\n142.\n\nPursuant to the plain meaning of the word \"manifest\" in the context of Article 52 of the **ICSID Convention** and considering the finality and binding nature of awards, features set forth in Article 53 of said Convention, for this Committee, the excess of powers should be obvious, evident, clear, self-evident and extremely serious.\n\n143.\n\nRegarding the failure to apply the proper law, \"[t]he drafting history of the ICSID Convention shows that a Tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the proper law could constitute a manifest excess of powers, but that erroneous application of the law could not amount to an annullable error, even if it is manifest... there is no basis for an annulment due to an incorrect decision by a Tribunal, a principle that has been expressly recognized by many *ad hoc* Committees.\"140\n\nBackground Paper on the Annulment Mechanism for the ICSID Administrative Council, August 10, 2012, \u00b69l\n\n144.\n\nIn the opinion of this Committee, it is necessary to distinguish between the failure to apply the proper law and an error in the application of that law. The first is a ground for annulment under Article 52, the second is not. Reviewing the substantive reasoning by which an arbitral tribunal reached its conclusions would require reexamining how the tribunal applied or interpreted the law, which would transform annulment committees into appellate tribunals. Under this scenario, committees would necessarily have to evaluate the facts and the evidence as well as the legal principles put forward by the parties all of which were already analyzed by the respective arbitration tribunal. This would change the very nature of the **ICSID** arbitration system.\n\n145.\n\nIn this case, **Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the **ICSID Convention** regarding: i. jurisdictional issues; ii. the causal link between the measures adopted by **Argentina** and the sale of **El Paso\u2019s** interest in the Argentine Companies; iii. the measures adopted in relation to the spot price and the capacity payments; iv. the cumulative effect of the measures; v. the necessity defenses raised by **Argentina** during the arbitration process and vi. issues related to the valuation of damages. The Committee will examine each of these arguments in turn.\n\n***i. Jurisdictional Issues***\n------------------------------\n\n146.\n\n**Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers in relation to jurisdictional issues:\n\na) When the **Tribunal** recognized in paragraph 175 of the **Award** that the arguments of **El Paso** were not viable because they entailed claiming twice for damages caused by the same event, the **Tribunal** should have rejected the claim. According to **Argentina,** the **Tribunal** clearly lacks the jurisdiction to amend a claim so as to make it viable because this implies rendering an *ultra petita* decision;141\n\nb) When the **Tribunal** acted in a contradictory manner by accepting the damages valuation submitted by LECG which implicitly referred to the damage sustained by the Argentine Companies;142\n\nc) When the **Tribunal** ruled that the measures taken by Argentina were one of the reasons that contributed to the damage sustained by **El Paso** and that there is a causal link between these measures and the alleged damage suffered;143\n\nd) When the **Tribunal** sought to justify its jurisdiction by stating that the **BIT** grants shareholders a direct right of action;144 and\n\ne) When the **Tribunal** exercised jurisdiction over **El Paso\u2019s** claims for damages even though none of the rights held by that company was affected by the measures taken by **Argentina.** For **Argentina,** the **Tribunal\u2019s** decision to award damages to **El Paso** on the basis of the alleged rights of the Argentine Companies is inconsistent with the **ICSID Convention** and the **BIT,** so the **Tribunal** exceeded the limits of its powers set forth in those rules.145\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 19.\n\nId.,\u00b6 21.\n\nId., \u00b6 22.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 26 and 27.\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 31 and 38.\n\n147.\n\nNext, the Committee will focus on analyzing the five overriding arguments related to the **Tribunal\u2019s** manifest excess of powers in relation to jurisdictional issues submitted by **Argentina:**\n\n148.\n\nIn its claim regarding paragraph 175 of the **Award** (subparagraph (a) of paragraph 146 above), **Argentina** stated that the **Tribunal** had no jurisdiction to amend a claim to make it viable and in doing so it acted *ultra petita* (see paragraph 31 above). According to **Argentina,** the **Tribunal** by accepting **El Paso\u2019s** claim exhibited a manifest excess of powers.\n\n149.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s opinon that there was no amendment nor was there a situation of *ultra petita* as alleged by Argentina and even less an obvious or self-evident excess of powers discernible without the need for an elaborate interpretation.\n\n150.\n\nThe Committee notes that paragraph 175 of the **Award** is linked to paragraph 174, in which the **Tribunal** explained that **El Paso** argued that Article I of the **BIT** has a very broad wording, so in its opinion, it could include the shares in the Argentine Companies, as well as legal and contractual rights of these companies. Accordingly, the **Tribunal** stated in paragraph 175 of the **Award** that these arguments were not feasible because they involved claiming twice for damages arising from the same event. In paragraphs 178 to 198 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** examined the arguments of **El Paso** and stated what in its opinion were not investments under the **BIT,** while in paragraphs 199 to 214 it defined which of **El Paso\u2019s** claims were indeed investments protected by Article I of the **BIT.** It carefully distinguished between the Argentine Companies\u2019 contractual rights, which it does not consider protected investments, and El Paso\u2019s shares, which it does consider as such. This distinction clarifies that the Tribunal concentrates on the claim that El Paso brought in its own right and avoids at the same time the danger of double compensation.\n\n151.\n\n**Argentina** did not show how, in its view, in those paragraphs or others of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** \"amended\" **El Paso\u2019s** claim in those paragraphs or others of the **Award** and thus committed the violation of *ultra petita,* thereby, manifestly exceeding its powers.\n\n152.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Committee will reject the *ultra petita* argument raised by **Argentina** under the heading of manifest excess of powers.\n\n153.\n\nRegarding the allegation of contradiction that caused the **Tribunal** to supposedly display manifest excess of powers (subparagraph (b) of paragraph 146 above), **Argentina** claimed that this contradiction occurred when the **Tribunal** accepted the valuation of damages made by LECG, which implicitly referred to the damage that the **Argentine Companies** would supposedly have suffered, while in paragraphs 188, 194, 195, 198 and 214 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** stated that rights, licenses or contractual rights were not investments protected by the **BIT,** and only the shares were.\n\n154.\n\nThe Committee believes that it is necessary to point out that any incidental contradictions in the **Award** is not necessarily a ground for annulment because the Committee cannot review whether the **Award** is fair or not, right or wrong. Nor can it evaluate the evidence, as claimed by **Argentina** on this particular issue, when it tells the Committee that the report providing a valuation of damages and which was considered by the **Tribunal** implicitly has content that is inconsistent with the view expressed by that **Tribunal** in the **Award.**\n\n155.\n\nThe **ICSID Convention** does not empower this Committee to evaluate the evidence referred in paragraph 153, which the **Tribunal** already evaluated, nor to decide whether implicitly or explicitly, that report included damages that should not have been included. Nor can it judge whether such damages were valued by the **Tribunal** improperly or unfairly. To do so would convert the recourse of annulment into an appeal.\n\n156.\n\nAs indicated above, the Committee will also reject the application for annulment filed by **Argentina** for alleged manifest excess of powers by contradictions in the **Award** with respect to damages.\n\n157.\n\nAnother annulment argument related to jurisdictional issues refers to paragraphs 175 and 687 of the **Award** in which the causal link between the measures adopted by **Argentina** and the damage suffered by **El Paso** (subparagraph (c) of paragraph 146 above) is analyzed. **Argentina** stated that \"... the Tribunal, dogmatically and without providing the reasons for its decision, manifestly exceeded its powers.\"146**Argentina,** after criticizing the method used for valuing the alleged damage,147 stated \"...the Tribunal allowed El Paso to bring a claim for contract breaches which, at the same time, purportedly amount to violations of the obligations assumed by Argentina to investors under the BIT, as if there was no corporate distinction between El Paso and the Argentine Companies in which it is a shareholder and as if the Tribunal itself had not expressly recognized that the contracts of the Argentine Companies are not protected investments.\"148\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 22.\n\nId.,\u00b623.\n\nId., \u00b6 24.\n\n158.\n\n**Argentina\u2019s** arguments contained in the preceding paragraph are complaints typical of an appeal. Clearly, **Argentina** disagrees with the valuation method used by the **Tribunal** and further stated that the Tribunal \"...allowed El Paso to bring a claim for contract breaches which, at the same time, purportedly amount to violations of the obligations assumed by Argentina to investors under the BIT\"149 and allowed a double recovery.150 The Committee considers it important to state that an arbitral tribunal cannot \"allow\" or \"prevent\" a party from claiming what it considers appropriate. What is finally granted by the Tribunal may or may not be the full amount claimed by the claimant; thus, in paragraphs 174 and 175 of the **Award** the **Tribunal** stated that **El Paso\u2019s** claims were contradictory and therefore not viable. By stating the contradiction in the Claimant\u2019s reasoning, the **Tribunal** did not incur in a cause for annulment, as **Argentina** stated. The possibility of a \"double recovery\" is an issue that the **Tribunal,** (not the Committee), should and did consider. The causal link between the measures taken by the Government of **Argentina** and the damages claimed was precisely what the **Tribunal** analyzed in the **Award.** To this end it examined the reports of the experts of the Parties and another independent expert appointed by the **Tribunal.** The Committee cannot and should not decide whether the causal link made by the **Tribunal** based on the evidence received is correct or incorrect.\n\nId., \u00b6 24.\n\nId.,\u00b625.\n\n159.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee will also reject **Argentina\u2019s** argument presented in the preceding two paragraphs.\n\n160.\n\nAnother allegation of **Argentina** on jurisdictional issues151 that would allegedly lead to the annulment of the **Award** is founded on the **Tribunal\u2019s** decision to exert its competence (subparagraph (d) of paragraph 146 above) \"... by stating that the Treaty grants shareholders a right of direct action,\"152 \"...allowing a shareholder to take advantage of the ICSID system... amounts to a manifest excess of powers by the Tribunal...\"153 Immediately after **Argentina** made those statements it stated:\n\n\"As previously stated, the Tribunal held that the investment protected under the BIT \u2018was constituted by the shares in the Argentinian companies that belonged to El Paso\u2019 and that protection applies to \u2018the shares, all the shares, but only the shares.\u2019 This justification confuses the legal standing that a shareholder may have, in general terms, to bring a claim under the BIT with the substantial rights arising from its shares. If the Argentine Republic had adopted measures with respect to El Paso\u2019s rights arising from its protected investment under the Treaty\u2014i.e., the shares\u2014(for example, the right to transfer its shares or receive dividends) such measures would have referred to the rights arising from the shares held by El Paso. In this case, however, Argentina did not adopt any measures that might affect the rights of El Paso as a shareholder in the Argentine companies.\"154\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 26-30.\n\nId.,\u00b6 26.\n\nId.,\u00b6 27.\n\nId.,\u00b6 29.\n\n161.\n\nThe above quote proves that **Argentina** is asking this Committee to determine that Argentina did not take any action that affected the rights of **El Paso.** Obviously, such a determination could only be made by the **Tribunal,** not by this *ad hoc* Annulment Committee.\n\n162.\n\nFrom paragraphs 199 to 214 of the **Award** the **Tribunal** analyzed what was the investment of **El Paso.** In its summary of paragraphs 213 and 214 it stated that the investment protected by the **BIT** is constituted by the shares in the Argentine Companies that belonged to El Paso. It is obvious that said paragraph cannot be read in isolation, as in the preceding paragraph the **Tribunal** stated that \"... El Paso\u2019s shareholdings in the Argentinian companies are protected regardless of whether they are majority or minority participations.\" The Committee does not find that the **Tribunal** \"confuses the legal standing that shareholders may have, in general terms, to bring a claim under the BIT with the substantial rights arising from its shares\" or that this \"confusion\" would bring about the cancellation of the **Award.**\n\n163.\n\nBased on the conclusion in the preceding paragraph, the Committee also will reject this argument for annulment founded on \"jurisdictional issues.\"\n\n164.\n\nThe last allegation of manifest excess of powers based on jurisdictional issues is that, supposedly, the **Tribunal** exercised jurisdiction over damage claims filed by **El Paso** without any of the rights of that company having been affected by the actions of **Argentina** (subparagraph (d) of paragraph 146 above).\n\n165.\n\nThis Committee believes that the **Tribunal** decided on its jurisdiction and decided broadly what could constitute an investment under the **BIT** and what would not. The **Tribunal** also considered carefully the decisions of other Tribunals in relation to that **BIT** standard and summarized its conclusions on the protection of majority or minority interests and rights of foreign shareholders in local companies.155 The Committee does not consider that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers in the matters indicated; it is of the opinion that the **Tribunal** made an extensive analysis of many issues before defining what applied to the case and what did not. Besides, this Committee\u2019s analysis cannot judge whether any of **El Paso\u2019s** rights was affected, as the damages claim has already been decided by the **Tribunal.**\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 205-212.\n\n166.\n\nAs indicated in the previous paragraph, the Committee also will reject this last argument based on \"jurisdictional issues.\"\n\n***ii. The causal link between the measures adopted by Argentina and the sale of El Paso\u2019s interest in the Argentine Companies***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\n**Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers when referring to the causal link between the measures adopted by Argentina and the sale of **El Paso\u2019s** interest in the Argentine Companies. It explained that in the arbitration proceedings it demonstrated that it was the global situation of the company itself why **El Paso** chose to sell those shares; it criticized the evaluation made by the **Tribunal** from the journalistic evidence supplied by **El Paso** and pointed to inconsistencies in paragraph 508 of the **Award.156**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 53-68.\n\n168.\n\nThe Committee notes that although **Argentina,** in the paragraphs relating to this claim, reiterated its allegation of manifest excess of powers by the **Tribunal,** it gave no grounds for annulment of the **Award** on the basis of these facts. The evaluation made by the **Tribunal** from journalistic evidence is a task for that body, not for this Committee. That evaluation criticized by **Argentina** concerning the reasons why **El Paso** sold the shares is a matter over which the **Tribunal** alone has powers. It fully exercised them in a long explanation of the facts in paragraphs 114 to 122 of the **Award,** and in a carefully reasoned argumentation, according to which the measures were not the only but certainly the prevailing reason for El Paso\u2019s sales (paragraph 507 of the **Award).** This Committee cannot and should not discuss Argentina\u2019s allegation of \"El Paso\u2019s serious crisis\"; neither is the Committee authorized to determine what other assets **El Paso** sold or did not sell in other countries during the crisis in Argentina.\n\n169.\n\nRegarding \"... the inconsistency...so manifest\" claimed by **Argentina,157** the Committee reiterates that, even if it existed, any contradiction on its own is not grounds for annulment. Inherent inconsistencies must be such that they are material to the outcome and thus, amount to a ground of annulment. In theory, there might be instances where inherent inconsistencies may amount to a lack of reasons or a manifest excess of powers, but this is not the case here. Paragraph 508 of the **Award** about which **Argentina** claims there is an \"inconsistency\" should be read in conjunction with paragraph 509, since the former refers to the measures taken by **Argentina** considered individually, while in paragraph 509 the **Tribunal** stated that it would analyze the effects of those measures as a whole to determine whether there was a violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment.\n\nId.,\u00b665.\n\n170.\n\nWithout judging in any way whether the measures taken by **Argentina,** individually or collectively, were what led to **El Paso\u2019s** sale of the shares, this Committee does not find that paragraphs 508 and 509 are contradictory, since they refer to two kinds of analyses made by the **Tribunal.** Nor does it find that there is any basis to assert that paragraph 508 demonstrates a manifest excess of powers because in it the **Tribunal** analyzes the measures claimed by **El Paso** as violating its rights.\n\n171.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee will reject this argument for annulment.\n\n172.\n\n**Argentina** also stated: \"In direct opposition to the analysis of the sale process of the Argentine Companies, the Tribunal\u2014which thus manifestly exceeded its powers\u2014 concluded that the measures adopted by the Argentine Republic were the prevailing reason for the sale by El Paso in 2003 and that this was a violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment.\"158\n\nId.,\u00b667.\n\n173.\n\nThe way in which **Argentina** presented the arguments for annulment requires the Committee to reiterate that contradictions *per se* are not valid grounds for annulling an award. In addition, the Committee considers it necessary to indicate that in the Memorial on Annulment and then in the Reply on Annulment, **Argentina** repeated the reference to paragraphs 277 and 508 of the **Award** and reiterated that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers when it decided that the main reason for the sale of the shares held by **El Paso** were the measures adopted by **Argentina.** The Committee has found no explanation that would lead it to conclude that the **Tribunal** made a decision on matters that the Parties did not submit for its decision, or that it did not apply the proper law on this issue. The Committee therefore does not consider that the **Tribunal** by reaching its conclusion on this matter exceeded its powers. Accordingly, it will reject this argument for annulment.\n\n***iii. Spot price and capacity payments***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nRegarding the measures taken by **Argentina** in connection with the spot price and capacity payments, Argentina alleged a manifest excess of powers on the part of the **Tribunal** by contradicting itself in the analysis of the measures adopted in the electric power sector. The **Tribunal** held that there was no contract between **El Paso** and **Argentina** embodying a stabilization clause; that the Electricity Act does not provide for capacity payments to be stated in dollars; and that the Tribunal did not consider that unfair and inequitable changes were made in the setting of the spot price and the seasonal price. According to **Argentina,** the conclusion in paragraph 512 of the **Award** contradicts the above analysis of the **Tribunal.** These contradictory conclusions and unfounded statements are, in the opinion of **Argentina,** a manifest excess of powers.159**Argentina** also argued that the above statements contradict paragraph 514 of the **Award**160 and that these allegedly contradictory findings are a cause for annulment since they amount to a manifest excess of powers.\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 69-83.\n\nId., \u00b6 82.\n\n175.\n\nThe Committee reiterates that the alleged contradictions on their own, even if they existed, are not grounds for annulment of the **Award.** The Tribunal analyzed the Argentinian measures first in the general macroeconomic context (paragraphs 390-402) and then, more specifically, for the electricity sector (paragraphs 403-458). It carefully analyzed caps on spot prices (paragraphs 410-416) and the changes of the capacity payments (paragraphs 417-422). It concluded that these measures were not a violation of the FET (paragraphs 422). It continued to analyze further measures in the oil and gas sector (paragraphs 423-449) including pesification (paragraphs 450-458). It concluded that none of the measures individually constitutes a violation of the FET standard. The Committee is unable to see any contradiction nor any cause for annulment in this reasoning.\n\n176.\n\nParagraph 512 of the **Award** shows that for the foreign investor the important thing was that payments are made in dollars. That statement was supported by the **Tribunal** in the opinion of **El Paso\u2019s** expert reproduced in paragraph 511 of the **Award.** In the second sentence of paragraph 512 the **Tribunal** held that **Argentina** did not consider the ultimate goal of capacity payments, which was to attract foreign investment. According to **Argentina** that statement is contradictory and by that finding the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers. The Committee believes that those issues were presented by the Parties to consider whether there had been a violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, so the **Tribunal** did not exceed its powers in analyzing them.\n\n177.\n\nAs regards what was expressed by the **Tribunal** in paragraph 514 in relation to the currency agreed on in the contracts and the possible consideration that said agreement was a special commitment to the investor, it is important to note that the abovementioned cannot be understood in isolation, instead it must be read at least in conjunction with the two preceding paragraphs in which the **Tribunal** indicated the matters that, in its view, the investor considered when making the investment. In the opinion of this Committee, if there is any contradiction in the wording of paragraph 514 when compared to paragraph 458, it is not of such a magnitude as to affect the final outcome of the **Award** which held **Argentina** liable for the cumulative effect of the measures, not for the consequences of pesification.\n\n178.\n\nAccordingly, the Committee does not consider that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers and therefore will reject this argument for annulment.\n\n***iv. Cumulative effect of the measures***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nRegarding the cumulative effect of the measures adopted by **Argentina,** the latter argued in its Memorial on Annulment that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers161 because, in its opinion, the **Tribunal** created a new standard by referring in the **Award** to the creeping violations of the standard of fair and equitable treatment;162 also because, according to **Argentina,** the **Tribunal** did not resort to the applicable law, but to a different law created by itself.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 85-87 and 89.\n\nAward, \u00b65I8.\n\n180.\n\nThe Committee carefully reviewed the above-mentioned argument and concluded that what the **Tribunal** did in the **Award** was an interpretation of fair and equitable treatment of the **BIT** in relation to the facts of the case, based on what was decided by the Tribunals in the *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. The Dominican Republic163* and the *LG&E et al. v. Argentina164* cases.\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. Dominican Republic,* Case LCIA No. UN 7927 [hereinafter *\"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale\"],* Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, September 19, 2008.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1 [hereinafter *\"LG&E\"],* Decision on Liability, October 3, 2006.\n\n181.\n\nThe Committee also considers that the **Tribunal** developed in paragraphs 515 to 517 the reasons for the conclusion that it reached in paragraph 519 concerning the cumulative effects of the measures taken by **Argentina.** It argued that one must not only look at these measures individually but in their totality and \"that a combination of all these measures completely altered the overall framework\" (paragraph 515). It added referring to *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale v. The Dominican Republic,165* \"that acts that are not illegal can become such by accumulation\" (paragraph 516). These are the arguments (and not the reference to the concept of *creeping expropriation),* that led the **Tribunal** to the conclusion that a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard existed. The **Tribunal** drew the parallel in paragraph 518 and found that it reinforced its argumentation. The Committee does not understand the **Tribunal** as stating that **Argentina** is liable because there had been a creeping violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment. Although this concept was mentioned in paragraph 518 of the **Award,** this was not the reason for the finding of liability.\n\n*Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale,* Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, September 19, 2008.\n\n182.\n\nParagraph 518 is not the basis for the conclusion that the **Tribunal** reached in paragraph 519 of the **Award,** in which it found that there had been a violation of fair and equitable treatment by the cumulative effects of the measures adopted by **Argentina.** Thus, there was no creation of a new standard nor was another law applied to the case. Accordingly, the Committee considers that the **Tribunal** did not manifestly exceed its powers in this matter.\n\n183.\n\nThe Committee is of the opinion that it is useful to consider the statement in the *AES et al v. Hungary* case in which the *ad hoc* committee discussed a similar argument for annulment, since the arbitral tribunal in that case stated the following in the award:\n\n\"In 2001, there was a great probability that there would be no administrative pricing after 2004, but this does not equate to absolute certainty giving rise to internationally protected legitimate expectations\".166 The committee in that case examined the position of the parties with respect to the claimants\u2019 argument for annulment in that the arbitral tribunal applied a nonexistent standard when it spoke of the \"absolute certainty standard\" and stated:\n\n\"Regarding the \u2018absolute certainty\u2019 issue, the Committee is unable to find that the Tribunal has introduced a distinct legal standard which is invented, illogical or otherwise incorrect. As noted by Hungary, the reference only appears in the Award after the Tribunal found that, as a matter of law, in order to be legitimate and bind government conduct, an expectation has to be based on express governmental assurances and representations. The Tribunal then found, as a matter of fact, that AES failed to produce evidence of those assurances or representations.\"167\n\n*AES Summit Generation Limited and AES-Tisza Er\u00f4m\u00fc KFT v. Hungary,* ICSID Case ARB/07/22 [hereinafter \"AES\"], Award, September 23, 2010, \u00b6 9.3.25.; *AES,* Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, June 29, 2012, \u00b682.\n\n*AES,* Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, June 29, 2012,\u00b6 95.\n\n184.\n\nSimilar to the *AES* case, in the present case it is not possible to consider that the **Tribunal** created a new standard in the **Award.**\n\n185.\n\n**Argentina** also stated that an error of law, when it is egregious, is considered to be grounds for annulment. According to Argentina, what the Tribunal did \"was not to misinterpret the **BIT,** but to modify its content, thus turning it into a rule that provides for composite acts, which amounts to a manifest excess of its powers.\"168\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 55.\n\n186.\n\nThe Committee reiterates the following concept which it has already stated in a different way in this decision:\n\n\"The drafting history of the ICSID Convention also demonstrates that annulment \u2018is not a procedure by way of appeal requiring consideration of the merits of the case, but one that merely calls for an affirmative or negative ruling based upon one [of the grounds for annulment].\u2019 It does not provide a mechanism to appeal alleged misapplication of law or mistake in fact. The Legal Committee confirmed by a vote that even a \u2018manifestly incorrect application of the law\u2019 is not a ground for annulment.\"169\n\nBackground Paper on the Annulment Mechanism for the ICSID Administrative Council, August 10, 2012, \u00b673.\n\n187.\n\nThe Committee does not consider that there is a \"modification\" in the contents of the **BIT** as **Argentina** claimed. As the **Tribunal** pointed out in paragraph 338 of the **Award,** the **BIT** does not define what is meant by fair and equitable treatment; **El Paso** made the same point in paragraph 38 of its Post-Hearing Brief. In the opinion of the Committee, **El Paso** is right to indicate that the **BIT** does not exclude any form of violation of that standard, whether through individual acts or through the cumulative effects of the acts indicated as violations of that standard. The **Tribunal,** after giving a detailed explanation of the content of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, analyzed both forms of violation, based on its reasoned interpretation of the **BIT.**\n\n188.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Committee finds that there was no manifest excess of powers on the part of the **Tribunal,** arising from the decision on the cumulative effects of the measures taken by **Argentina.**\n\n***v. Defenses of necessity***\n------------------------------\n\n189.\n\n**Argentina** also argued manifest excess of powers with regard to the defenses raised. It stated that:\n\na) In analyzing Article XI of the **BIT** to determine whether or not it is a self-judging standard the Tribunal did not even mention the evidence submitted by **Argentina** in the course of the arbitration proceedings.170\n\nb) The Tribunal also erred when it concluded in paragraph 591 of the **Award** that **Argentina** could not rely on the BITs entered into after 1991 nor on the 1992 Model Treaty.171\n\nc) The Tribunal also exceeded its powers when it employed a speculative exercise in paragraph 594 of the **Award.172**\n\nd) The Tribunal failed to apply Article VI (3) of the **BIT.173**\n\ne) The Tribunal failed to examine the defense of necessity under customary international law174\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 127.\n\nId.,\u00b6 131.\n\nId., \u00b6 133.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 143 and 144.\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 145-157.\n\n190.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, the Committee will consider these five arguments of Argentina:\n\n191.\n\nRegarding the alleged violation related to the evidence that **Argentina** submitted about the nature of Article XI of the **BIT** (subparagraph (a) of paragraph 189 above), the Committee must, once again, reiterate that it is not an appeal tribunal and therefore cannot or should not decide whether evidence was well or ill-considered or not considered at all by the **Tribunal.** Rule 34 (1) of the **Arbitration Rules** is clear when it indicates that the **Tribunal** alone is empowered to decide on two fundamental issues related to the allegation of **Argentina:** the admissibility of evidence and its probative value.\n\n192.\n\nMoreover, the Committee considers it is important to note that the **Tribunal** in paragraphs 563 to 587 of the **Award,** analyzed evidence submitted by **Argentina** and **El Paso** on this specific issue and referred to it when addressing the arguments of each Party. Therefore, the Committee does not observe a manifest excess of powers on the part of the **Tribunal** because the Parties requested this specific issue to be resolved. The Tribunal had full authority to accept or reject the evidence and to assess it.\n\n193.\n\nFor the above reasons, the Committee will reject this argument for annulment.\n\n194.\n\n**Argentina** also asserted that the **Tribunal** demonstrated manifest excess of powers in its statement in paragraph 591 of the **Award** (subparagraph (b) of paragraph 189 above).175 It argued that \" [n]othing in the Vienna Convention or under general international law justifies the conclusion that no instrument issued after the conclusion of a treaty may be taken into account for the purpose of determining the intent of the parties, particularly where those acts by the State were prior to the execution of the treaty. The Tribunal\u2019s assertion constitutes a failure to rely on the applicable law.\"176\n\nThe Committee clarifies that Argentina cited footnote number 152 of the Memorial on Annulment paragraph 590 of the Award, but this should be 591.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 131.\n\n195.\n\nThe **Tribunal** analyzed the position of **Argentina** in connection with the self-judging nature of Article XI of the **BIT** in paragraphs 563 to 573 of the **Award.** In paragraphs 568 and 569 it referred to the evidence that **Argentina** filed, including documents to show that one year after the signing of the **BIT** the State Department of the United States of America introduced similar treaties and a model treaty to the Senate and in the latter the self-judging nature of a provision similar to Article XI of the **BIT** was established; it also cited a statement by the U.S. Senate in favor of the self-judging nature of Article XI of the **BIT.** The **Tribunal** held that such evidence was irrelevant.177 The Committee notes that the **Tribunal** assessed the evidence provided by **Argentina** to interpret the **BIT** in light of the Vienna Convention; later on178 the **Tribunal** considered other evidence. The **Tribunal** conducted an analysis of the wording of Article XI of the BIT;179 then went on to analyze the context180 of that Article; it also considered subsequent practices (Article 31(3) of the Vienna Convention)181 and the object and purpose of the treaty.182 The **Tribunal** concluded that Article XI is not self-judging and that said body had the power to interpret it.183\n\nAward, \u00b659l.\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 593-596.\n\nId., \u00b6 590.\n\nId., \u00b6 599.\n\nId., \u00b6 602.\n\nId., \u00b6 604.\n\nId.,\u00b6 610.\n\n196.\n\nFrom the above summary, the Committee concludes that the **Tribunal** analyzed, from different points of view and with diverse methods of interpretation, the alleged self-judging nature of Article XI of the **BIT.** The analysis is *lege artis* and thorough. Therefore, the **Committee** does not find that the **Tribunal** failed to apply the applicable law nor that it manifestly exceeded its powers when it performed its analysis. The assessment of the evidence and interpretation of the applicable law must be performed only by the **Tribunal,** not by the Committee. For these reasons, the Committee will reject this argument for annulment.\n\n197.\n\n**Argentina** also alleged manifest excess of powers because, in its view, in paragraph 594 of the **Award** (subparagraph (c) of paragraph 189 above) the **Tribunal** contradicted the very arguments presented by the US Department of State and made an unfounded speculative exercise when it stated that the US did not seek to attribute a self-judging character to Article XI of the **BIT.184**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 133.\n\n198.\n\nIn the following paragraph **Argentina** mentioned the evidence that shows that, in its opinion, the United States of America and Argentina did have the intention of making Article XI of the BIT self-judging in nature.185**Argentina** then stated:\n\n\"The Tribunal seems to ignore the fact that, if a State has no means of protecting its external and internal security, there is no way of creating a stable and prosperous investment climate. Moreover, the Tribunal refers in general terms to the alleged object and purpose of the Treaty, without even considering critical and irrefutable evidence that demonstrates that the intention of the parties to the BIT is wholly inconsistent with its proposition.\"186\n\nId., \u00b6 134.\n\nId., \u00b6 135.\n\n199.\n\nThe Committee concludes that, obviously, this argument of **Argentina** is actually an attempt to get the Committee to assess \"critical and irrefutable evidence that demonstrates... the intention of the parties to the BIT.\" This is impossible in an annulment proceeding, so the Committee will reject this argument.\n\n200.\n\n**Argentina** further argued that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers when it failed to apply Article VI (3) of the **BIT** (subparagraph (d) of paragraph 189 above).187 The Committee carefully reviewed the arguments on this issue contained in **Argentina\u2019s** Memorial on Annulment and in **Argentina\u2019s** Reply and found that they were inaccurate, especially when **Argentina** affirmed that the interpretation given to that Article by the **Tribunal \"...** is the same as that deriving from the application of other Treaty provisions...

Algeria* case189 analyzed a bilateral investment treaty provision similar to Article VI (3) of the **BIT,** interpreted it in a very different manner from the **Tribunal,** and concluded that \"a different interpretation would deprive the provision of any meaning and effect.\"190\n\n*Consorzio Groupement L.E.S.I. - Dipenta (Italy) v.

Algeria* case191 was not binding on the **Tribunal.** It reiterates that not following the line of reasoning of another arbitral tribunal is not grounds for annulment just as interpreting an article of the **BIT** in one sense or another is also not grounds for annulment. The **Tribunal** had, indeed, analyzed Article IV (3) and concluded that it was not applicable to \"the matter at hand\".192 This is a reasoned opinion. The fact that **Argentina** does not agree with this interpretation of Article IV (3) of the **BIT** is not a ground for an annulment. Consequently, the Committee will therefore reject this argument.\n\n*L.E.S.I.,* Award, January 10, 2005.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 556-560.\n\n203.\n\n**Argentina** further contended that the **Tribunal** did not address separately the defense of necessity under customary international law.193 The Committee considers that the **Tribunal** explained its methodology in paragraphs 552-555 of the Award and came to the conclusion that Article XI of the **BIT** was *lex specialis* and that only if Article XI did not apply, a further analysis would be necessary. Having found that Article XI was applicable, any further inquiry was held to be superfluous. **Argentina** may disagree with the **Tribunal\u2019s** approach but that is no ground for an annulment. The Committee therefore will reject this claim.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 145.\n\n***vi. Issues related to the valuation of damages***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nOn the issue of the valuation of damages, **Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers because:\n\na) The amount of compensation awarded is contrary to applicable law and to the legal principles established by the **Tribunal** itself.194\n\nb) **El Paso** did not claim for the cumulative effects of the measures, therefore the valuation cannot be deemed to satisfy the causation requirement.195\n\nc) The **Tribunal,** in paragraph 704 of the **Award,** adopted a valuation taking values projected in 2003, after the alleged breaches of **Argentina,** for the purpose of defining the standard of compensation.196\n\nd) The **Tribunal** used the standard of compensation established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case, when case law is not a source of law, therefore the **Tribunal** did not specify the law applicable for that standard.197\n\nId., \u00b6 161.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 163, 167 and 168.\n\nId., \u00b6 171.\n\nId., \u00b6 172.\n\n205.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, the Committee will consider these four arguments for annulment put forward by **Argentina:**\n\n206.\n\n**Argentina** indicated that the amount of compensation awarded by the **Tribunal** is contrary to applicable law and to the legal principles established by the **Tribunal** itself (subparagraph (a) of paragraph 204 above). In its Reply on Annulment, it stated:\n\n\"The Tribunal is under a duty to decide every dispute in accordance with the law and is only entitled to decide cases *ex aequo et bono* where the parties have so agreed. In this case, the parties have not authorized the Tribunal to decide the case *ex aequo et bono.* El Paso cannot seek to justify the Tribunal\u2019s decision by relying upon its alleged discretion, disregarding the law that the very Tribunal recognized as applicable.\"198\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 114.\n\n207.\n\nThe Committee believes that arbitration tribunals may proceed with some discretion in quantifying damages. A reasoned exercise of such discretion, as performed by the **Tribunal,** does not amount to a decision *ex aequo et bono.* The Committee did not find convincing arguments to explain in what way the **Tribunal** failed to apply the applicable law and decided *ex aequo et bono* and therefore will reject these assertions by **Argentina.**\n\n208.\n\nRegarding causation, **Argentina** stated that **El Paso** did not claim for the cumulative effects of the measures, and that the valuation cannot be deemed to satisfy the causation requirement (subparagraph (b) of paragraph 204 above).\n\n\"The Tribunal maintains that it examined \u2018the relationship between the sale of El Paso\u2019s shares in the Argentinian companies and the GOA measures in the context of determining whether such measures may be considered a violation of the FET standard, concluding that the measures were the prevailing cause of the sale.\u2019 Nonetheless, the result of such analysis is not conclusive as regards the causal link between the alleged breach of the Treaty and the damage allegedly deriving from such breach. That the measures were allegedly one of the reasons for the sale of El Paso\u2019s shares does not mean that any loss that might derive from such sale has a \u2018sufficient causal link\u2019 with the alleged violation of the Treaty.\"199\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6I68.\n\n209.\n\nThe Committee reiterates that it cannot decide on the matter to which **Argentina** refers in the paragraph reproduced; such valuation is the exclusive responsibility of the arbitral tribunal.\n\n210.\n\nThe Committee finds that the **Tribunal** did not manifestly exceed its powers when it decided on damages as stated by **Argentina,** so it will reject this ground for annulment.\n\n211.\n\nAccording to **Argentina,** the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers by adopting in paragraph 704 of the **Award,** for purposes of compensation, a valuation taking \"values projected in 2003, after the alleged breaches by **Argentina** (subparagraph (c) of paragraph 204 above), placing **El Paso** in a different situation than that existing before the alleged \u2018creeping measures.\u2019\"200\n\nId.,\u00b6 171.\n\n212.\n\nPart of paragraph 704 of the **Award** states:\n\n\"The fair market value in the *but for* scenario shall be calculated considering also data and information which became known after 1 January 2002, including after El Paso\u2019s sales in 2003, to the extent they are representative of financially assessable damages. Arbitrator Stem considers that a fair market value evaluation of damage resulting from a violation of FET should only take into account what a willing buyer and a willing seller could foresee at the time of the interference with the investor\u2019s rights. However, as, for reasons explained in paragraph 736, the Tribunal finally relies on a valuation taking into account the prices of oil as foreseen in 2003, at the time of the sale, she does not expand on the theoretical aspects of the question of the indemnification standard and the time of valuation.\"\n\n213.\n\nThe decision about which values should be considered to define the amount for which **Argentina** shall be liable can only be taken by the **Tribunal** that heard the facts and evidence submitted by the Parties. The Committee cannot assess the facts and the evidence submitted in the proceedings. Nor does the Committee find that there was a manifest excess of powers because the **Tribunal** took into account the 2003 or other data; it therefore will reject this argument for annulment.\n\n214.\n\n**Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal** manifestly exceeded its powers when it used the standard of compensation established by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w* case (subparagraph (d) of paragraph 204 above) to set the standard of compensation, disregarding the fact that case law is not a source of law. Therefore, according to **Argentina,** the **Tribunal** did not specify the law it applied to determine damages.201\n\nId., \u00b6 172.\n\n215.\n\nThe **Tribunal** stated its views on the standard of compensation that it employed and in paragraph 700 of the **Award** stated its reasoning. It referred to the silence of the **BIT** in this area, to the *Chorz\u00f3w* case, and it considered what other tribunals had decided on the damage caused by the violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment. It further pointed out the reasons why it considered that fair market value ought to determine the compensation.202\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 700-703.\n\n216.\n\nAs stated in Article 42 (2) of the **ICSID Convention****,** if the primary standard does not give a solution to a matter to be resolved by an arbitral tribunal, that silence is no excuse for the tribunal not to decide said matter. Arbitral tribunals must resort to different methods of interpretation to decide the dispute according to the mandate received from the parties. The fact that in this case the **Tribunal** looked at the *Chorz\u00f3w* case to be helped in its interpretation does not imply a manifest excess of powers. While case law is not a source of law, as **Argentina** has stated, this does not prevent it being used as the basis of the reasoning for a decision taken by an arbitral tribunal. Consequently, the Committee will reject this argument for annulment.\n\n**B. Failure to state reasons**\n-------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nSubsequently, the Committee will turn to this ground for annulment. In the opinion of the Committee there is no ground for annulment of the award if it is based on an alleged inaccuracy of the arbitral tribunal\u2019s reasoning or because the reasons underlying its decisions were not convincing to the Party requesting the annulment of the Award. The Committee agrees with other committees which have ruled along this line repeatedly203 because unconvincing reasons do not amount to a lack of reasons. Annulment committees are concerned with the existence of reasoning and not the correctness, content or adequacy of the same. Unless the findings cannot be supported by any reasons reflected in the award, there is no basis for annulment. Reasons need not be detailed but they must be sufficient for a reader to follow how, from the evidence and arguments filed by the parties, the tribunal reached its conclusions.\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner,* Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Arbitral Award, May 3, 1985, \u00b6 129; *Maritime International Nominees Establishment v.

As pointed out by other committees,205 the requirement to state reasons is intended to ensure that the Parties can understand the reasoning of the Tribunal, and also that a well-informed reader can understand the facts and the law by which the tribunal reached its conclusions.\n\n*MINE,* Decision on the Application for Partial Annulment of the Arbitral Award, December 14, 1989 \u00b6 5.09; *Vivendi I,* Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002 \u00b6 64; *Wena Hotels,* Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Arbitral Award, February 5, 2002 \u00b6 81; and *Compagnie de Exploitation du Chemin de Fer Transgabonais v. Gabonese Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/5, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment, May 11, 2010, \u00b6 88.\n\n221.\n\nSimilarly, it is obvious to this Committee that it cannot annul an award because one of the parties involved in the case disagrees with the reasons given by the arbitral tribunal. The ground laid down in Article 52(e) of the **ICSID Convention** is very clear: it is the failure to state reasons, i.e., the absence of the statement of reasons when the claims of the parties in the arbitration proceedings are being analyzed. The statement of reasons which are contradictory to a point to neutralize each other fall into that same category.\n\n222.\n\n**Argentina** indicated that there are several manifestations of this ground: the total absence of reasons; the total failure to state reasons on a particularly key issue; the statement of contradictory reasons; and the reasons given are insufficient. This Committee considers that the main manifestation of this ground is the failure to state reasons referred to in the previous paragraph.\n\n223.\n\n**Argentina** alleged the following failures to state reasons for its decisions:\n\na) In paragraph 175 of the **Award** the **Tribunal** failed to state the reasons for the causal link.206\n\nb) The Tribunal \"...sought to justify the exercise of its jurisdiction by stating that the Treaty grants shareholders a right of direct action.\"207\n\nc) There is a contradiction between the **Tribunal\u2019s** conclusion that contracts and licenses are not investments protected by the **BIT** and the granting in the **Award** of compensation in favor of **El Paso** for measures affecting only contracts and licenses belonging to the Argentine Companies.208\n\nd) The Tribunal did not state in paragraph 507 of the **Award** the reasons on which it based the fundamental conclusion that allowed it to find **Argentina** liable.209 (referring to the sale by **El Paso** of the shares in the Argentine Companies)\n\ne) The **Tribunal** clearly contradicts itself in its analysis of the measures adopted in the electric power sector; \"... the only attempt to provide reasons in the ruling is contained in paragraphs 512-514.\"210\n\nf) The **Tribunal\u2019s** \"judicial creation\".211\n\ng) The conclusions expressed in paragraph 588 of the **Award.**212\n\nh) The conclusion expressed in paragraph 591 of the **Award.213**\n\ni) The Tribunal failed to refer to the key evidence related to the self-judging nature of Article XI of the **BIT.214**\n\nj) The Tribunal\u2019s statement in paragraph 603 of the **Award** about Argentina\u2019s \u2018awareness\u2019 of the self-judging nature of Article XI of the **BIT.215**\n\nk) The **Tribunal** equated the \"non-contribution\" requirement to the \"necessity\" requirement in paragraphs 555 and 613 of the **Award** 216\n\nl) The **Tribunal\u2019s** conclusion with respect to Article IV(3) of the **BIT.**217\n\nm) The **Tribunal** did not state the legal standards it applied nor the meaning of \"noncontribution\" and referred only to economic, rather than legal, arguments in the analysis of this matter.218\n\nn) The contradiction in the Tribunal adopting the valuation carried out by LECG219\n\no) The **Tribunal** adopted a valuation method that assumes that **El Paso** retained holdings in the Argentine Companies220\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 22.\n\nId., \u00b6 26.\n\nId., \u00b6 40.\n\nId., \u00b6 64.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 69 and 70.\n\nId.,\u00b6 101.\n\nId., \u00b6 128.\n\nId., \u00b6I3I. The Committee notes that the quote in the footnote of the Memorial on Annulment refers to paragraph 590 but this should be 591.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 132.\n\nId., \u00b6 138.\n\nId., \u00b6 140.\n\nId., \u00b6 144\n\nId., \u00b6 157.\n\nId., \u00b6 164.\n\nId., \u00b6 174.\n\n224.\n\nThe Committee will discuss below the fifteen allegations of failure to state reasons submitted by **Argentina.**\n\n225.\n\nRegarding the alleged failure to state reasons in paragraph 175 of the **Award** (subparagraph (a) of paragraph 223 above), particularly in the sentence \"[t]hat the loss of share value is linked to the taking of the rights belonging to the local company appears obvious,\"221 the Committee points to the fact that this paragraph is part of the section in which the **Tribunal** defined \"investment\" in light of Article I(1)(a) the **BIT.** The **Tribunal** expressly linked the sentence quoted above to paragraph 204 of the **Award.** It explained in the two paragraphs that double compensation for **El Paso** should be avoided. The Committee understands that sentence and the one in paragraph 204 are part of the statement of reasons for the **Tribunal\u2019s** conclusion a few paragraphs later (213 and 214 of the **Award).** Here, the **Tribunal** held that the contracts and licenses are not part of the investment protected under the **BIT,** but only the shares of **El Paso** in the Argentine Companies.\n\nAward, \u00b6 175.\n\n226.\n\n**Argentina** stated that the **Tribunal \"...** failed to state the reasons on which its decision was based when it sought to justify the exercise of its jurisdiction by stating that the Treaty grants shareholders a right of direct action\" (subparagraph (b) of paragraph 223 above).222\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 26.\n\n227.\n\n**Argentina** stated in its Memorial on Annulment that \"[u]nder general international law, indirect actions such as those filed... in this arbitration are not permitted,\"223 despite the quotation in the previous paragraph. This is a confusing reasoning. Additionally, the Committee considers necessary to clarify another issue: the **ICSID Convention** does not include requirements on how to plead annulment, but logic dictates that it must be a clear and precise allegation and in this case **Argentina** did not give any reference as to the paragraph in which the **Tribunal** \"sought to justify the exercise of its jurisdiction by stating that the Treaty grants shareholders a right of direct action.\"224\n\nId., \u00b6 49.\n\nId., \u00b6 26.\n\n228.\n\n**Argentina** stated that the **Award** does not state the reasons for its decisions (Subparagraph (c) of paragraph 223 above). Specifically, it stated:\n\n\"the Argentine Republic has explained that, even though an investment in shares was indeed a protected investment under the Treaty, a shareholder only had a valid claim under the Treaty to the extent that its rights as such were affected by governmental measures. However, in direct opposition to its conclusion that contracts and licenses are not protected investments, the Tribunal awarded damages to El Paso for measures that only affected contracts and licenses belonging to the Argentine Companies.\"225\n\nId., \u00b6 40.\n\n229.\n\nIn its Reply, **Argentina** added:\n\n\"Argentina explained why there is a failure to state the reasons for the Award which warrants its annulment, with respect to the recognition of El Paso\u2019s rights as a shareholder in the Argentine Companies. In this regard, Argentina made it clear that even though an investment in shares is indeed a protected investment under the Treaty, a shareholder only has a valid claim under the Treaty to the extent that its rights as such are affected by governmental measures.\"226\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 21.\n\n230.\n\nIn the opinion of the Committee, **Argentina** did not explain its allegation that the **Tribunal** gave **El Paso** compensation for measures that affected only those contracts and licenses of the Argentine Companies and that said conclusion was made without the **Tribunal** stating the reasons which would permit an understanding of its decision in this regard.\n\n231.\n\nIn addition, **Argentina** stated the following about the infringement of the rights of shareholders:\n\n\"As previously stated, the Tribunal held that the investment protected under the BIT \u2018was constituted by the shares in the Argentinian companies that belonged to El Paso and that protection applies to \u2018the shares, all the shares, but only the shares.\u2019 This justification confuses the legal standing that a shareholder may have, in general terms, to bring a claim under the BIT with the substantial rights arising from its shares. If the Argentine Republic had adopted measures with respect to El Paso\u2019s rights arising from its protected investment under the Treaty\u2014i.e., the shares\u2014(for example, the right to transfer its shares or receive dividends) such measures would have referred to the rights arising from the shares held by El Paso. In this case, however, Argentina did not adopt any measures that might affect the rights of El Paso as a shareholder in the Argentine companies.\"227\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 29.\n\n232.\n\nFrom a combined reading of the statement made by **Argentina** reproduced in paragraphs 228, 229 and 231 above, the Committee concludes that, in fact, what Argentina wants is for the Committee to make an analysis of the merits of the case, in order to annul the **Award.** The basis of this claim would be that \"Argentina did not adopt any measures that might affect the rights of El Paso as a shareholder in the Argentine companies,\" concluding that the **Tribunal** awarded \"damages to El Paso for measures that only affected contracts and licenses belonging to the Argentine Companies.\" As repeatedly stated, the Committee cannot analyze the merits of the case nor adjudicate on the alleged errors on the merits that an arbitral tribunal may have committed in an arbitration award.\n\n233.\n\nIn another of its allegations **Argentina** noted (subparagraph (d) of paragraph 223 above):\n\n\"Nevertheless, contrary to its previous assertions, without providing any reasons and in violation of a fundamental rule of procedure, the Tribunal decided to rule against the Argentine Republic for the sale by El Paso of the Argentine Companies. Thus, it held that \u2018the GOA measures were, if not the only, certainly the prevailing reason for El Paso\u2019s sales in 2003.\u2019 However, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for this essential conclusion that led it to rule against Respondent, especially bearing in mind that a series of documents produced by El Paso itself refer to other reasons, but not to the measures adopted by Argentina.\"228\n\nId., \u00b6 64.\n\n234.\n\nThe Committee notes with respect to the argument reproduced in the above paragraph that the **Tribunal** described the measures taken by **Argentina** in paragraphs 98 to 104 of the **Award** and described the sale of the shares held by **El Paso** in the Argentine Companies (paragraphs 114 to 120). In paragraph 277 it pointed out which were the factors that, in its opinion influenced the sale: the financial situation of **El Paso** in several countries as well as **Argentina\u2019s** economy and the measures taken by that State. In paragraph 279 it noted that it had not identified an automatic causal link between the measures and the sale of the shares for purposes of an expropriation claim, but it had to determine it in the case of a violation of other standards of the **BIT.** Later on, the **Tribunal** analyzed each measure taken by **Argentina** in the electricity and oil and gas sectors. In paragraph 459 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** said that it would analyze the overall role of the measures on the sale of the shares and said it would focus on the defenses raised by **Argentina** on this issue: whether the liquidity problems of **El Paso** since late 2001 and the principal activity of the company were the causes that led to the sale. This analysis was made in paragraphs 489 to 503. The **Tribunal** considered **Argentina\u2019s** arguments in defense in paragraph 504 of the **Award,** it reviewed the reports submitted by **El Paso** to the American authority on securities *(i.e.* the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision \"SEC\"); and it referred to the sale of other companies and, based on that analysis, held in paragraph 507 that the measures were the primary reason for the sale of the shares.\n\n235.\n\nThe Committee is of the opinion, based on what was said in the previous paragraph, that the **Tribunal** did express reasons for its decision in a very detailed way. It has no authority to assess whether these reasons were insufficient or inadequate because the grounds stated in Article 52(e) of the **ICSID Convention** is the failure to state the reasons, not if these were inadequate or insufficient.\n\n236.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the **Tribunal** analyzed, indeed, why it considered that the measures were the primary reason for the sale of the shares.\n\n237.\n\n**Argentina** also alleged a contradiction between the analysis made by the **Tribunal** of the measures adopted by Argentina in the electricity sector and what it stated in paragraphs 512 and 514 of the **Award** (subparagraph (e) of paragraph 223 above). Regarding the first paragraph **Argentina** argued that the **Tribunal,** without providing any reasons, reached the conclusion that the Argentine Government disregarded the very reason for which capacity payments were created, that is, to attract foreign investment and expand capacity by allowing investors to recover their capital costs in US dollars, destroying the relationship between capacity payments and how they are calculated in dollars. **Argentina** also noted that the **Tribunal,** contrary to its previous assertions and without providing reasons, states in paragraph 514 that the fact that the contracts were in US dollars could be viewed as a special commitment towards the companies in which **El Paso** invested while in other paragraphs of the **Award** the **Tribunal** states that **Argentina** was not a party to any agreement with **El Paso** and that there were no specific commitments. **Argentina** further argued that the companies in which **El Paso** invested were neither investors nor investments protected under the **BIT.229**\n\nId.,\u00b6\u00b6 81-83.\n\n238.\n\nThe Committee carefully reviewed the paragraphs to which **Argentina** referred to and the analysis made by the **Tribunal** of the measures adopted by that State. In its view, these paragraphs must be read in conjunction with others, in particular 84, 98 and 408. In the first, the **Tribunal** described the actions that **Argentina** took to attract investment in the energy sector. Argentina conducted seminars and \"road shows\" in which it stressed, among other things, that capacity payments would be in dollars. In paragraph 98 of the **Award** the **Tribunal** set out in detail the measures adopted by **Argentina** in the electricity sector that affected the values provided in the Wholesale Electricity Market, and in 408 stated the main purpose of capacity payments. From the above, the Committee concludes that in the statement by the **Tribunal** in paragraphs 512 and 514 there is no contradiction that could lead it to conclude that the **Award** failed to state reasons on this issue.\n\n239.\n\n**Argentina\u2019s** other argument for annulment is the **Tribunal\u2019s** \"judicial creation\" (subparagraph (f) of paragraph 223 above). **Argentina** stated:\n\n\"In conclusion, the Tribunal\u2019s \u2018judicial creation,\u2019 which jeopardizes legal certainty\u2014 not only in this case, but also in future proceedings if this theory starts to be followed by other tribunals\u2014 amounts to a manifest excess of the powers of the Tribunal, a failure to state the reasons on which the decision was based, and a serious departure from the rules of procedure, which warrants the annulment of the Award.\"230\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 101; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 64.\n\n240.\n\nThe Committee does not understand fully **Argentina\u2019s** argument. Case law is created with the repetition of judgments of tribunals over time. The essence of expressing reasons is to explain why a tribunal decides an issue in one way and not the other. This process is the opposite to a failure to state reasons. The award is an element of the emergence of case law and not its creation. The conditions to annul the **Award** for a failure to state reasons are obviously not met in this context.\n\n241.\n\n**Argentina** further argued a lack of statement of reasons in Article 588 of the **Award** (subparagraph (g) of paragraph 223 above):\n\n\"The Tribunal merely notes that \u2018the evidence presented by the Respondent relates to a single element of Article XI, \u2018essential security interests,\u2019\" while Article XI mentions two other possible justifications: the maintenance of public order and the fulfilment of the State\u2019s obligations regarding the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security. In accordance with the Tribunal, \u2018at first glance, the present case does not, however, seem to concern (external) security interests but possibly the maintenance of (internal) public order, which would not be a self-judging matter at all under Article XI of the BIT.\u2019 The Tribunal does not explain why the expression \u2018essential security interests\u2019 should be limited to matters of external security, instead of including internal security issues, as the *Continental* tribunal did, particularly the gravity of the economic, social and political crisis experienced by Argentina and acknowledged by the very Tribunal. In arriving at this arbitrary conclusion, the Tribunal only takes a \u2018first glance,\u2019 yet it should have expressed the reasons for its decision on this fundamental matter.\"231\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 128.\n\n242.\n\nIn order to understand **Argentina\u2019s** argument, the Committee carefully reviewed paragraph 588 of the **Award.** The Committee cannot and ought not review whether the evidence presented by **Argentina** concerning Article XI of the **BIT** relates or not to \"essential security interests.\" Moreover, it considers that it was on that evidence that the **Tribunal** stated that \"[t]his could be taken to suggest that the self-judging character of Article XI is, at any rate, limited to \u2018essential security interests\u2019 and cannot extend to the other elements, in particular the maintenance of public order.\" The **Tribunal** in the first part of that paragraph stated that it was necessary, before analyzing the Article in question in light of the Vienna Convention, to indicate that the evidence on the self-judging character introduced by **Argentina** referred only to one aspect of the three contained in Article XI (essential security interests, the maintenance of public order, and the fulfilment of the State\u2019s obligations regarding the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security). The **Tribunal** also stated at the end of that paragraph \"[a]t first glance, the present case does not, however, seem to concern (external) security interests but possibly the maintenance of (internal) public order, which would not be a self-judging matter at all under Article XI of the BIT.\" These statements made by the **Tribunal,** were based on its consideration of the evidence provided by **Argentina.** The Committee therefore does not find any failure to state reasons under this issue.\n\n243.\n\n**Argentina** also alleged failure to state reasons in paragraph 591 (subparagraph (h) of paragraph 223 above). This paragraph of the **Award** refers to the analysis made by the **Tribunal** of the evidence presented by **Argentina** to define whether Article XI of the **BIT** was self-judging or not. In paragraph 590 the **Tribunal** stated that it would analyze the BIT in order to make a decision on that issue. In paragraph 591, it developed its interpretation and referred to the statement made by another arbitral tribunal in the *LG&E* case.232 The Committee considers that the **Tribunal** was clear in stating that it would use the Vienna Convention as a basis for its reasoning and furthermore it analyzed what was said by the *LG&E* arbitral tribunal. The **Tribunal** did indeed express the reasons for its decision and did indeed indicate the sources it used for its interpretation.\n\n*LG&E,* Decision on Liability, October 3, 2006.\n\n244.\n\n**Argentina** further submitted that there was a failure to state reasons when the **Tribunal** omitted critical evidence (the so-called letter from Mr. Sofaer) that **Argentina** presented to demonstrate the self-judging character of Article XI of the **BIT** (subparagraph (i) of paragraph 223 above). **El Paso** acknowledged that the **Tribunal** did not specifically mention the Sofaer letter in **Award,** and instead analyzed other evidence to support its conclusions on the issue.\n\n245.\n\nIn the opinion of the Committee, the **Award** is clear and as to the analysis made by the **Tribunal** in paragraphs 588 to 610, where it referred to the evidence adduced by the parties, used different methods of treaty interpretation and considered what other arbitral tribunals had ruled on the issue. The **Tribunal\u2019s** reasoning is clear, and the conclusion of the **Tribunal** and the reasons for said conclusion can be clearly understood. The Committee finds that that the absence of a specific mention of the Sofaer letter does not affect the reasoning of the **Award** on this issue. Furthermore, the fact that the **Tribunal** did not refer to a specific piece of evidence, which, according to **Argentina,** was essential, cannot be analyzed by this Committee, which has no authority to make any assessment of the evidence presented in the arbitral proceedings.\n\n246.\n\n**Argentina** argued that paragraph 603 of the **Award** contains an unfounded statement, which contradicts the evidence in the record (subparagraph (j) of paragraph 223 above). The **Tribunal,** at the end of said paragraph, stated that \"[f]inally, the \u2018awareness\u2019 of Argentina [in connection with the alleged self-judging character of Article XI of the BIT] seems to be of recent origin, having made its first appearance in the written pleadings on the substance of the present dispute.\" The Committee notes that **Argentina** argued that it had this awareness since CATS',233 a case in which Argentina had also claimed the same defense as in this case. The Committee reiterates that it cannot analyze the evidence adduced by the parties in the arbitration process, much less check whether **Argentina** argued this issue in another case to determine when, in its view, it acquired the awareness of the self-judging character of Article XI of the **BIT.** The Committee carefully read paragraph 603 of the **Award,** and found in it that the **Tribunal** expressed some of its reasons for concluding that the rule was not of that character. The deliberation of the **Tribunal** at the end of paragraph 603 does not affect the reasoning in that paragraph, nor does it demonstrate that the **Award** omitted the statement of the reasons on which its conclusions are based and therefore it cannot be a ground for annulment.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* [hereinafter *\"CMS\"],* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Award, May 12, 2005.\n\n247.\n\n**Argentina** also argued the following in relation to the analysis of Article XI of the **BIT** made by the **Tribunal** (subparagraph (k) of paragraph 223 above):\n\n\"The \u2018non-contribution\u2019 requirement by no means precludes the application of Article XI, as it is not contained in that provision. Such requirement may not be equated with the \u2018necessity\u2019 requirement, as arbitrarily done by the Tribunal, since these are two different and clearly distinguishable requirements.\"234\n\nId., \u00b6 140.\n\n248.\n\nThe Committee considers that paragraphs 555 and 613 of the **Award** to which **Argentina** referred in the quote above cannot be analyzed separately from the rest. The **Tribunal,** in paragraphs 613-624, explained why it considered the degree of **Argentina\u2019s** contribution to the situation that arose in that country, for purposes of the concept of state of emergency, in order to determine whether in the case at hand, Article XI of the **BIT** (containing the non-precluded measures provision) applied. In those paragraphs reference is made to the Vienna Convention, the purpose of the **BIT,** the doctrine of State responsibility, the dicta of other arbitral tribunals in the *LG&E235* and the *Continental236* cases, and the UNIDROIT Principles. The Committee does not find that the **Tribunal** made that \"equating\" unreasonably; on the contrary, it considers that the **Tribunal** explained broadly the reasons it had for considering \"non-contribution\" in this issue. Therefore, there is no failure to state reasons in the paragraphs alleged by **Argentina.**\n\n*LG&E,* Decision on Liability, October 3, 2006.\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award [hereinafter *\"Continental\"],* September 5, 2008.\n\n249.\n\nAccording to **Argentina,** (subparagraph (1) of paragraph 223 above) the conclusion reached by the **Tribunal** in relation to Article IV(3) of the **BIT** is unfounded.237 It also cited the conclusion of the arbitral tribunal in the *EE.S.I. v. Algeria* case238 which had a different interpretation of a provision similar to Article IV (3) of the **BIT239**\n\nId., \u00b6 144.\n\n*L.E.S.I.,* Award, January 10, 2005.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 100\n\n250.\n\nIn paragraphs 557 and 558 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** summarized the position of the Parties on the interpretation of Article IV(3) of the **BIT,** and in paragraph 559 it interpreted this rule based on its \"plain meaning\" and relied on dicta on the same Article by the arbitral tribunal in the *CMS* case.240 The fact that there is a different interpretation *(L.E.S.I.* case), as pointed out by **Argentina,** or another interpretation, does not mean that the **Award** is not supported by reasoning. The decision of the **Tribunal** with respect to Article IV (3) of the **BIT** is very clear and does not constitute grounds for annulment based on the lack of reasons.\n\n*CMS,* Award, May 12, 2005.\n\n251.\n\n**Argentina** also claimed, based on the dissenting opinion, that the majority did not state reasons for the conclusion expressed in paragraph 665 of the **Award** that **Argentina** contributed substantially for the crisis to occur, so that Argentina could not rely on Article XI of the **BIT** in its defense (subparagraph (m) of paragraph 223 above). **Argentina** specifically alleged:\n\n\"...as stated by one of the members of the Tribunal, the majority did not state the reasons on which that part of the Award was based, failed to explain the legal standards applied by it\u2014particularly, the meaning ascribed to \u2018non-contribution\u2019 in adopting its criterion\u2014 and referred only to economic (rather than legal) arguments. The Award must therefore be annulled.\"241\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 157.\n\n252.\n\nThe Committee considers it important to clarify that the dissenting opinion in the **Award** does not state exactly what **Argentina** indicated. On the contrary, the **Tribunal** was unanimous in considering that Article XI is not self-judging. The dissent concerns the interpretation of the evidence received in the proceedings. Professor Stern concludes that \"... the substantial contribution of the Argentine authorities to the crisis has not been sufficiently proven by strong and uncontroverted evidence... the evidence is insufficient to conclude that the policies adopted by the GOA before the crisis were mainly responsible for the crisis.\"242\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 666 and 670.\n\n253.\n\nThe fact that there is a dissenting opinion does not mean that the majority vote is unfounded and that, therefore, it should be annulled. In this case, moreover, the dissent is not on the legal standards applicable, or on the meaning of \u2018noncontribution,\u2019 but consists of a different assessment of the evidence, an issue on which the Committee cannot intervene in any way.\n\n254.\n\nThe Committee carefully studied paragraphs 613 to 626 of the **Award** which are based on the uncontested statement that Article XI of the **BIT** has to be analyzed first, since it is *lex specialis* with respect to other provisions (paragraph 550 of the **Award):** in paragraph 613 the **Tribunal** indicated what standard it considered appropriate for interpreting Article XI of the **BIT.** In paragraphs 614 and 615 the **Tribunal** held that, in considering the object and purpose of the **BIT,** as noted by the Vienna Convention on the Interpretation of Treaties, it was possible to determine the role of a State\u2019s contribution to a crisis or state of necessity. It indicated in paragraph 618, based on a part of the doctrine, what kind of State\u2019s contribution should be considered for this purpose. In paragraphs 619 and 620 the **Tribunal** considered the decision in two other cases *(LG&E* and *Continental)* on the same Article of the **BIT** that it was analyzing. In paragraphs 621 to 623 it stated what other rules **of the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles** and the Unidroit Principles provide on the exclusion of liability and the degree of contribution to a state of necessity to conclude, in paragraph 624, that there is a principle of international law related to the exclusion of liability and noncontribution; accordingly it did explain what principle would apply to the case.\n\n255.\n\nIn paragraph 611 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** stated that a state of emergency may be economic in nature. In paragraphs 651 to 665 it analyzed the evidence presented in relation to the crisis suffered by **Argentina.** It considered what the experts of the Parties, the International Monetary Fund reports, the statements of Argentine authorities, and the opinions of economists and researchers had stated. It concluded in paragraph 665 that **Argentina** had contributed substantially to the crisis, and, consequently, in the opinion of the **Tribunal,** it could not rely on Article XI of the **BIT** in its favor.\n\n256.\n\nBased on what the Committee observed in the **Award,** it is impossible to conclude that the **Tribunal** did not define the legal standards it applied or that it did not indicate what, in its opinion, \u2018non-contribution\u2019 meant; nor is it possible to conclude that the **Tribunal** only referred to economic and not legal arguments. The Committee therefore does not find that there is any merit to **Argentina\u2019s** arguments. The **Tribunal** was clear in its analysis; it stated reasons and explained amply the decisions taken on this issue.\n\n257.\n\n**Argentina** also alleged (subparagraph (n) of paragraph 223above):\n\n\"The contradiction arises when the Tribunal takes the valuation carried out by LECG based merely on the fact that it was \u2018satisfied that LECG has calculated the Claimant\u2019s damage under its DCF valuation method by considering only damage directly attributable to the GOA measures.\u2019 Leaving aside the fact that the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of LECG\u2019s valuation is erroneous; the Tribunal does not follow the abovementioned premise that it should determine the existence of a sufficient causal link between the damage and the treaty violation. This constitutes a failure to state reasons regarding the causation principle.\"243\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 164.\n\n258.\n\nIn the paragraph reproduced, **Argentina** criticized the **Tribunal\u2019s** interpretation of the valuation carried out by LECG **(El Paso\u2019s** damages expert). This issue is obviously an assessment of the evidence which power rests entirely in the **Tribunal** and cannot be grounds for annulment. In paragraphs 674 and 685 of the **Award,** the **Tribunal** indicated that the LECG\u2019s damages report used a methodology called \"discounted cash flow\"; the calculation presented included only the damage caused by the measures taken by **Argentina** and excluded damages due to macroeconomic conditions, which, according to the Tribunal, was confirmed directly by the Tribunal\u2019s own appointed expert.244 That is, the **Tribunal** based its decision on what was included in the LECG\u2019s damages report and the report of a third expert, appointed by the Tribunal.\n\nAward, \u00b6 686.\n\n259.\n\nRegarding the causal link between the measures and the losses supposedly suffered by **El Paso,** the **Tribunal** evaluated the position of **Argentina,** in the sense that for the causal link to exist, the international wrongful act must be the proximate cause between the measures and the losses.245 The **Tribunal** concluded that in this case the \"proximate cause\" did not exist and, based on what other tribunals ruled, used the method of sufficient link.246 That is, the **Tribunal** examined two possible ways to assess causation, concluded that **El Paso** had not contributed to the damages and then referred to the conclusion reached in paragraph 507 of the **Award,** to the effect that the measures adopted by **Argentina** were the main reason for the sale of the shares held by **El Paso** in the Argentine Companies.\n\nId., \u00b6 677.\n\nId.,\u00b6 682.\n\n260.\n\nThe Committee does not find any failure to state reasons in this issue. The **Tribunal** was clear, it analyzed the positions of the Parties, and considered what was said by their experts and by the third expert appointed by the **Tribunal** itself.\n\n261.\n\nThe last argument of **Argentina** on the failure to state reasons (subparagraph (o) of paragraph 223 above) referred to the fact that the **Tribunal** considered a method of valuation which assumes that **El Paso** retained holdings in the Argentine Companies. Specifically, **Argentina** stated:\n\n\"The Tribunal held Argentina liable stating that: \u2018taking an all-encompassing view of consequences of the measures complained of by El Paso, including the contribution of these measures to its decision to sell its investments in Argentina, [the Tribunal] concludes that, by their cumulative effect, they amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\u2019 Nonetheless, in determining the amount of damages, the Tribunal did not take into account the sales price of El Paso\u2019s shareholding but, rather, adopted a valuation method that \u2018assumes that the Claimant continues to keep its shareholding in said companies.\u2019 This contradiction also evidences the Tribunal\u2019s failure to state the reasons on which the decision was based.\"247\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 174.\n\n262.\n\nThe statements made by **Argentina** in the previous paragraph is nothing more than a disagreement with the decision of the **Tribunal,** since the valuation of the sale price or the fact of noting that **El Paso** retained its shares in order to estimate the damage, is the **Tribunal\u2019s** own valuation, in which matter the Committee cannot intervene. This is not a failure to state reasons but simply that the **Tribunal** chose a method that **Argentina** considered \"assumes that the Claimant continues to keep its shareholding in said companies\" and not \"the sales price of El Paso\u2019s shareholding.\"\n\n263.\n\nFor the reasons set forth in paragraphs 225 to 262 above, the Committee will reject the 15 requests for annulment filed by **Argentina** referred to in paragraph 223 above.\n\n264.\n\n**Argentina** also claimed in its Memorial on Annulment on the subject of the cumulative effect of the measures adopted by **Argentina** that the **Award** failed to state the reasons248 on which the decision was based; in its Reply the argument was summarized as follows:\n\n\"In its Counter-Memorial, El Paso shows that it does not fully understand why Argentina contends that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its decision when applying the \u2018new standard\u2019 (something like a \u2018creeping fair and equitable treatment\u2019 standard). As stated by Argentina, in order for there to be a composite act in the sense of Article 15 of the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles, a series of requirements developed by legal authors and the ILC itself must be met. For example, the Tribunal does not explain why Article Il(2)(a) of the US-Argentina BIT\u2014referring to \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019\u2014allegedly provides for a composite act, that is, an obligation arising from the cumulative character of the conduct, as required by the ILC; or how many actions or omissions are needed in order for there to be a violation of the obligation concerned, as required as well by the ILC itself; or what part of the Article demands \u2018a systematic policy\u2019 or \u2018plan,\u2019 as that referred to by legal authors and Prof. Crawford, one of the Special Rapporteurs of the ILC who participated in the preparation of the Draft in question. Likewise, the Tribunal fails to specify which lawful act caused the series of measures individually considered as lawful by the Tribunal to become unlawful.\"249\n\nId., \u00b6 101.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 50.\n\n265.\n\nThe Committee carefully reviewed paragraph 518 of the **Award** which refers to the creeping violation of the FET standard and states:\n\n\"The Tribunal considers that, in the same way as one can speak of *creeping expropriation,* there can also be creeping violations of the FET standard. According to the case-law, a creeping expropriation is a process extending over time and composed of a succession or accumulation of measures which, taken separately, would not have the effect of dispossessing the investor but, when viewed as a whole, do lead to that result. A *creeping violation of the FET standard* could thus be described as a process extending over time and comprising a succession or an accumulation of measures which, taken separately, would not breach that standard but, when taken together, do lead to such a result\" (emphasis in the original).\n\n266.\n\nIn the paragraph quoted the **Tribunal** used the conditional or subjunctive verb form, \"could.\" That part of the paragraph is then hypothetical; it is an attempt by the **Tribunal** to illustrate its standard of interpretation, developed in the previous paragraphs. It is not the basis for the finding of liability that was the result of the **Tribunal\u2019s** interpretation of the cumulative effects of the measures (absolute change in the legal setup). Therefore, the Committee concludes that the **Tribunal** did not create a new standard and that the **Award** is not without a statement of reasons on this issue.\n\nC. **Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nBefore analyzing **Argentina\u2019s** allegations about alleged serious departures from fundamental rules of procedure it is necessary to consider the following concepts stated by the ICSID Administrative Council:\n\n\"It appears from the drafting history of the ICSID Convention that the ground of a \u2018serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\u2019 has a wide connotation including principles of natural justice, but that it excludes the Tribunal\u2019s failure to observe ordinary arbitration rules.\"250\n\nBackground Paper on the Annulment Mechanism for the ICSID Administrative Council, August 10, 2012, \u00b699.\n\n268.\n\nThe Committee considers that there is a logical conclusion from the above quotes: because a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" is such a broad concept, the party alleging the existence of such a ground must indicate what is the fundamental rule affected and define clearly where the serious departure lies, so it can be considered by the Committee.\n\n269.\n\nIt is also necessary to indicate that for this ground of annulment to exist, as clearly established in the ICSID Convention, two basic criteria are required: there has to be a *serious* departure from a *fundamental* rule of procedure, not just any rule of procedure. Furthermore, this Committee agrees with what other committees have stated that in order to be grounds for annulment, the departure has to have a material impact on the outcome of the award.251\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation, Pan American Development Limited, and P.

Because there was a contradiction in the **Tribunal\u2019s** conclusion on the process of the sale of the Argentine Companies and its conclusion that the measures taken by **Argentina** were the primary reason for the sale;252\n\nb. Because of the contradictions and unfounded statements contained in paragraphs 512 and 514 of the **Award;253**\n\nc. Because \"allowing a tribunal to punish a State for adopting a series of lawful measures which, taken together, allegedly amount to a wrongful act affects legal certainty and constitutes both a manifest excess of powers and a serious departure from the rules of procedure\";254\n\nd. Because the **Tribunal** did not mention the evidence consisting of the so-called \"Sofaer Letter\";255\n\ne. Because the **Tribunal** failed to analyze the most relevant evidence in support of Argentina\u2019s position regarding the self-judging nature of Article XI of the **BIT** and presented contradictory arguments in referring to the remaining pieces of evidence on that same issue;256\n\nf. Because in determining damages, the **Tribunal** did not consider the defenses raised by **Argentina;257**\n\ng. Because the **Tribunal** decided on issues that were not raised by **El Paso,** i.e., *ultra petita* ;258 and\n\nh. Because the **Tribunal** held **Argentina** liable for the violation of a standard that is not contained in the **BIT** and then awarded damages, relying on a damage assessment that was based on alleged **BIT** violations that are different from those invoked by **El Paso.259**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 67.\n\nId.,\u00b6 83.\n\nId., \u00b6 96.\n\nId., \u00b6 132.\n\nId., \u00b6 142.\n\nId., \u00b6 175.\n\nId., \u00b6 176.\n\nId., \u00b6 177.\n\n271.\n\n**Argentina** was very concise in explaining the reasons why, in its opinion, there was a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure. The allegations based on contradictions, failure to mention one piece of evidence that was considered essential for **Argentina** (the Sofaer letter), and the alleged failure to analyze other evidence do not constitute grounds for annulment of the **Award** for a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure and, accordingly, the Committee will reject the arguments set forth in subparagraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e) above.\n\n272.\n\nIn analyzing the allegation referred to in subsection (f) of paragraph 270 above, the Committee notes that **Argentina** did not state what were the defenses it objected to in the arbitration process in relation to damages and that the **Tribunal** did not analyze, thereby causing the alleged serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. In addition, **Argentina** did not even mention this issue in its Reply. Because of this lack of substantiation, the Committee will reject the application for annulment based on that reasoning.\n\n273.\n\nRegarding subparagraph (g) of paragraph 270 above, in paragraphs 151 and 152 above, the Committee rejected **Argentina\u2019s** argument on the alleged manifest excess of powers of the **Tribunal** for having acted supposedly *ultra petita.* For the same reasons, it will reject this argument based on the grounds alleged here.\n\n274.\n\nThe claims outlined in subparagraphs (c) and (h) of paragraph 270 above still have to be analyzed. In the former, **Argentina** stated that the **Tribunal** affected legal certainty and committed a serious departure from a procedural rule:\n\n\"...for adopting a series of lawful measures which, taken together, allegedly amount to a wrongful act..,\"260\n\nId., \u00b6 96.\n\n275.\n\nThe Committee notes that its specific role is to analyze whether there are grounds in the **Award** or in the arbitration process to allow the **Award** to be partially or totally annulled. Specifically, the duty of the Committee with regard to the ground for annulment that it is examining here is to ensure the integrity of the arbitration process. **Argentina** in this case did not explain why it considers that there was a manifest excess of powers nor did it indicate the fundamental rule of procedure from which the **Tribunal** seriously departed; for these reasons, the Committee will reject this argument.\n\n276.\n\nIn subparagraph (h) of paragraph 270 above there is a summary of **Argentina\u2019s** argument that the decision must be annulled because the **Tribunal** held **Argentina** liable for the violation of a standard that is not contained in the **BIT** and awarded damages relying on a damage assessment that was based on alleged **BIT** violations that are different from those invoked by **El Paso.261**\n\nId., \u00b6 177.\n\n277.\n\nThe Committee notes once again that **Argentina** did not state what fundamental rule of procedure was affected by the **Tribunal\u2019s** ruling, nor did it argue about the seriousness of the departure from this rule. Additionally it is important to reiterate what is stated in paragraphs 180 to 182 above in which the Committee concluded that the **Tribunal** did not create a new standard or apply a different law; therefore it also will reject this argument for annulment.\n\n278.\n\nIn its Memorial on Annulment and its Reply on Annulment262**Argentina** alleged serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and stated that its right to due process and to defense at trial had been adversely affected because it never had the opportunity to present arguments against the existence of an alleged \"composite act\" within the meaning of Article 15 of the ILC\u2019s Draft Articles.\n\nId., \u00b6\u00b6 96 and 97; Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 47.\n\n279.\n\nThe **Tribunal** referred to Article 15 in paragraph 516 of the **Award;** paragraph 515 is about the cumulative effect of the measures, n paragraph 517 after making an analysis of each measure the **Tribunal** determined what was, in its opinion, the cumulative effect and stated that it was \"... a total alteration of the entire legal setup for foreign investment.\"263\n\nAward, \u00b6 517.\n\n280.\n\nThe **Tribunal** analyzed the electricity and hydrocarbons regulatory frameworks in relation to fair and equitable treatment, as of paragraph 390 of the **Award.** In paragraph 390 the **Tribunal** referred to the opinion of **El Paso** as follows:\n\n\"...El Paso indeed finds that Argentina\u2019s measures go beyond the limits authorised by the BIT: in its view, the decisions and regulations in issue did not result from a normal exercise of regulatory powers but, in reality, were measures that brought a radical alteration of key rules, effectively eviscerated the existing regulatory frameworks, and therefore exceeded normal regulatory powers.\"\n\n281.\n\nThe Committee notes that the **Tribunal** analyzed individually the measures taken by **Argentina** and also referred to the \"legal setup,\" the \"legal order,\" and the \"legal framework,\" and that in paragraph 519 of the Award it concluded that the consequences of the measures, because of their cumulative effects, constituted a violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n282.\n\nThe following quotations show that the Claimant fought the measures that affected the \"legal framework\":\n\n\"When El Paso made its investment, it had legitimate and reasonable expectations that were created and encouraged both by the fundamental rules of the regulatory frameworks enacted and the assurances and representations made by the GOA, its President, its Minister of Finance and the Energy Secretariat... It reasonably expected that the GOA would not unforeseeably change the fundamental rules of the game that it established to attract foreign investment.\"264\n\n\"The aggregate effect of all these economic distortions cannot be overcome in the short term, and the GOA\u2019s measures are likely to last for years.\"265\n\n\"Despite the new regulatory legal environment that it had established, the Government interfered with the Electricity and Hydrocarbons Regulatory Frameworks and El Paso\u2019s investment lost a substantial portion of its value due to the acts and omissions of the Government and its subdivisions and instrumentalities. The damage continued to escalate until 2003, when El Paso sold its investments in the Argentine Companies at a price that represented a significant loss.\"266\n\n\"In January 2002, Argentina abruptly and drastically changed the rules on the basis of which the investment decisions had been made. These drastic changes to the Electricity and Hydrocarbons Regulatory Frameworks withdrew fundamental rights and protections previously provided to investors in the electricity and hydrocarbons sectors.\"267\n\n\"Argentina\u2019s actions in dismantling the Electricity Regulatory Framework and the Hydrocarbons Regulatory Framework and the frustration of rights contained in concession agreements were taken through measures that only a government can take. They involved legislation, decrees and resolutions and were clearly in the exercise of *\"puissance publique.\"* Therefore, Argentina\u2019s repudiation of El Paso\u2019s contractual rights amounts to a violation of fair and equitable treatment even under the more restrictive of the two theories.\"268\n\n\"In the present case, the series of actions by the Argentinean authorities indicates that they were acting consciously to abrogate the rights under the Electricity Regulatory Framework and the Hydrocarbons Regulatory Framework. Bad faith would be demonstrated if it were to be proved that some of the measures taken did not primarily serve the purpose ostensibly relied upon but were taken to deprive the investor of its rights. For instance, the export withholdings were introduced with the stated purpose of compensating the banks for the asymmetrical pesification suffered by them, but the revenue was apparently never used for that purpose. On the other hand, even a credible assertion of good faith on the part of Argentina will not controvert a finding of a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\"269\n\n\"In terms of previous decisions this treatment may be described as improper and discreditable, as arbitrary, idiosyncratic, unjust and disproportionate. More specifically, Argentina has thereby violated the principles of transparency, stability and of protecting the investor\u2019s legitimate and reasonable expectations. After creating regulatory frameworks for the electricity and hydrocarbons sector that were designed to project a stable legal and business environment, Argentina dismantled this system thereby removing the guarantees upon which El Paso had relied. Therefore, Argentina\u2019s behavior lacked transparency, predictability, consistency and coherence and failed to honor the investors\u2019 basic expectations.\"270\n\n\"Argentina [is]... portraying the measures taken by the GOA... as if they were decisions and regulations resulting from an exercise of normal regulatory powers when, in reality, the measures in question constituted a radical alteration of key rules and effectively eviscerated the Energy Regulatory Framework..,\"271\n\n\"What matters is the cumulative effect of the government\u2019s measures on the legitimate expectations of the foreign investor, expectations that may be reinforced by contractual obligations, unilateral government statements, rights granted in regulatory frameworks to induce investment, and, above all, the BIT itself, which establishes the normative legal environment upon which foreign investors may justifiably rely\".272\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial of August 20, 2004, \u00b6 537.\n\nId., \u00b6 322.\n\nOpinion prepared by Dr. Christoph Schreuer, dated November 3, 2006, submitted by El Paso, \u00b6 24.\n\nId.,\u00b625.\n\nId., \u00b6 359.\n\nId., \u00b6 377.\n\nId., \u00b6 386.\n\nReply on the Merits, November 28, 2006, \u00b6 26.\n\nW.M. Reisman, Supplemental Opinion of 5 November 2006, Claimant\u2019s Exhibit 210, \u00b6 10.\n\n283.\n\nIn the arbitration proceedings **Argentina** very clearly outlined the legal and regulatory framework of that nation:\n\n\"...El Paso\u2019s claim to prevent adapting the regulatory framework to the new context existing as a result of the crisis and the abandonment of the currency board system has no legal and factual background.\"273\n\n\"The legitimate expectations of any investor entering the market had to include the true possibility of changes and amendments to the Procedures. If these changes occurred before El Paso entered the market and continued taking place at a similar rate in the period prior to the crisis, the adjustment after the emergency cannot be deemed a modification to game rules.\"274\n\n\"El Paso seems to claim that its investment was protected against all risks and that Argentine Government was required to guarantee\u2014always and under any circumstances\u2014certain profitability over its investment. That is incorrect and would imply completely denaturalizing the regulatory framework applicable and the protection granted by bilateral investment treaties.\"275\n\n\"El Paso holds that the measures adopted by the Argentine Republic in 2002 to ensure the supply to the domestic market of oil and gas violated the applicable regulatory framework. Such assertion is wrong.\"276\n\n\"El Paso alleges that it was legitimate and reasonable to expect that the electricity and hydrocarbons regulatory frameworks would not change. However, it is unreasonable to expect a state not to amend its rules..,\"277\n\n\"In this case, the regulations challenged by El Paso are general. Furthermore, there are no specific and direct commitments towards Claimant. Therefore, the existence of an expectation that applicable regulations would not be amended cannot be invoked, especially in the face of a crisis..,\"278\n\n\"The analysis is focused on the measures adopted by the Argentine government within the framework of the 2002 crisis in order to determine the extent to which such measures constitute a deviation from industry regulatory frameworks unduly affecting the investments in the energy industries by impinging on the investors\u2019 legitimate expectations.\"279\n\n\"The facts on which we have to render an opinion refer to a set of legislative measures that allegedly violate the BIT,... and which constitute the basis of the claim filed by El Paso Energy International Company..,\"280\n\n\"Within the framework of this Treaty, the company El Paso challenges the implementation of a set of measures.\"281\n\n\"Regarding the situation of the concession, El Paso invokes the right to be compensated for the adoption of a number of measures that affect the concessionaires CAPS A and CAPEX. El Paso\u2019s allegations are based on a kind of *inalterability* of the situation derived from the concession. However, the alleged inalterability may only be expected, in principle, with respect to the rights arising from the concession regarded as a contract, never from the rules making up the regulatory framework\" (emphasis in the original).282\n\nCounter-Memorial on the Merits, September 1, 2006, \u00b6 275 (English version); \u00b6 274 (Spanish version).\n\nId., \u00b6 276 (English version); \u00b6 275 (Spanish version).\n\nId., \u00b6 314 (English version); \u00b6 313 (Spanish version).\n\nId., \u00b6 380 (English version); \u00b6 379 (Spanish version).\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, Marchl2, 2007, \u00b6 368.\n\nId., \u00b6 369.\n\n*\"Analysis on the Valuation of Damages on the Value of El Paso\u2019s Investments in Argentina\",* August 29, 2006, report prepared by MacroConsulting, submitted by Argentina, \u00b6 6.\n\nReport of C\u00e9sar Garc\u00eda Novoa, March 6, 2007, submitted by Argentina, \u00b6 21.\n\nId.,\u00b625.\n\nId., \u00b6 69.\n\n284.\n\nFrom the transcribed citations, the Committee concludes that during the arbitration proceedings the Parties did discuss whether **Argentina\u2019s** measures constituted a departure from the regulatory legal framework. The **Tribunal** analyzed each measure separately, but in various paragraphs of the **Award** it referred to the general effects on the legal framework to reach the conclusion expressed in paragraph 519 of the **Award.** It seems to the Committee that the **Tribunal** formed its opinion in the course of the written and oral submissions and discussions of the Parties during the proceedings, assisted by several expert opinions. **Argentina** was fully involved in these discussions, had ample opportunity to defend itself and counter all the arguments brought by the Claimant and its experts. The Committee has carefully studied the Parties\u2019 posthearing submissions and confronted them with the submissions made during the original proceedings. It found that the substance of the problem which finally led to the **Tribunal\u2019s** reasoning and decision had been exposed: that the cumulative effect of a series of measures which might be inoffensive and legal one by one may alter the global situation and the legal framework in a way that the investor could not have legitimately expected. The **Tribunal** concluded from the debate that the combined measures caused an illegal violation of the FET standard even when any one of those measures, appraised individually, were legal. It is not for this Committee to determine if the **Tribunal\u2019s** reasoning is correct. In the process of determining whether the Tribunal disrespected a fundamental rule of procedure, the Committee has to appraise if the **Tribunal** did not allow the Respondent to present its argument that a group of legal measures, taken together, cannot amount to an illegal breach of the **BIT.** The Committee is convinced that **Argentina** was not prevented from developing this argument. The fact that the **Tribunal** used the term \"creeping\" with the intention to summarize its line of reasoning by the use of such expression does not change the Committee\u2019s mind. The term was a way for the tribunal to synthesize its reasoning, which did not add to the **Tribunal\u2019s** argumentation. It was based on material that was introduced into the proceedings and legal considerations that were discussed in substance.\n\n285.\n\nThe **Tribunal** decided to enhance the expression of its considerations using, with respect to fair and equitable treatment, a concept typical of expropriation; it did not need to have recourse to that academic process in order to justify its reasoning but decided to do it that way. This procedure does not harm the Respondent at all, who defended vigorously throughout the arbitration proceedings, each of the measures it adopted and the effects of those actions on the overall legal environment in which the Claimant made its investment. No matter how it is looked at, the **Tribunal\u2019s** idea of the cumulative effects of the actions of the Respondent is simply a way to express the reasoning that led to its conclusions and, as such, cannot be a ground for annulment of the **Award.**\n\n286.\n\nFor the reasons set forth in the preceding paragraphs, the Committee considers that in this case there was no violation of due process or the right of defense, as fundamental rules of procedure. **Argentina** had the opportunity to defend itself and to express its point of view on the effect of the measures that it adopted during the crisis, and on the general legal framework. For this reason the Committee will reject **Argentina\u2019s** application for annulment, based on this and its other arguments.\n\n**V COSTS**\n-----------\n\n287.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Chapter VI of the Convention (Articles 59 to 61) shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to the annulment proceedings.\n\n288.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom these expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\"\n\n289.\n\nIn the First Session (paragraph 4.1) held on 18 July 2012, the Parties did not agree on a method for allocation of costs other than that provided for in Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n290.\n\nAlthough **Argentina\u2019s** application will be dismissed in its entirety, the Committee does not believe that this application was frivolous and considers that it was entirely legitimate for **Argentina** to raise some of the issues in which it based its request for annulment of the **Award,** in particular the question of due process. Therefore, in exercise of the discretion given to it by Article 61(2) of the **ICSID Convention****,** in the following section, the Committee will decide as follows:\n\n(a) **Argentina** shall bear the costs of the proceedings, which include the fees and expenses of the Members of the Committee, as well as the costs arising from the use of the **Centre;** and\n\n(b) Each party shall bear the costs and fees it incurred in regard to this annulment proceeding.\n\nVI **DECISION**\n---------------\n\n291.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Committee unanimously decides as follows:\n\ni. The Application for Annulment of the Award presented by Argentina is dismissed in its entirety.\n\nii. The suspension of enforcement of the Award, ordered by decision of November 14, 2012, is terminated.\n\niii.
