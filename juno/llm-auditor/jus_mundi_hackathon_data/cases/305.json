INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. The Parties**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present arbitration has been brought by Windstream Energy LLC (\"Windstream\" or the \"Claimant\"), a company incorporated in Delaware, the United States.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is the parent company of Windstream Wolfe Island Shoals Inc. (\"WWIS\"), a special purpose vehicle incorporated in Ontario, as well as Windstream Energy Inc. (\"WEI\"), which provides various services to WWIS under a Management Services Agreement. The Claimant in turn is managed by its managing director White Owl Capital Partners LLC (\"White Owl\"), a private equity firm based in New York City and founded in 2007 by Messrs David Mars and William Ziegler.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimant is represented in these proceedings by:\n\nMr John A. Terry\n\nMs Myriam M. Seers\n\nMr Nick E. Kennedy\n\nMs Emily S. Sherkey\n\nMr James Gotowiec\n\nMs St\u00e9phanie A. Lafrance\n\nTorys LLP\n\nSuite 3000\n\n79 Wellington St. West\n\nBox 270, TD Centre\n\nToronto, Ontario, M5K 1N2\n\nCanada\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is the Government of Canada (\"Canada\" or the \"Respondent\"). The Respondent is represented in these proceedings by:\n\nMs Sylvie Tabet, General Counsel and Director\n\nMr Shane Spelliscy, Counsel\n\nMr Rodney Neufeld, Counsel\n\nMr Raahool Watchmaker, Counsel\n\nMs Heather Squires, Counsel\n\nMs Susanna Kam, Counsel\n\nMs Jenna Wates, Counsel\n\nTrade Law Bureau\n\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development, Canada 125 Sussex Drive Ottawa, Ontario, K1A 0G2 Canada\n\n**B. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties arises out of an offshore wind electricity generation project in the Wolfe Island Shoals area in Ontario, Canada (the \"Project\" or the \"WWIS Project\"). The Project was undertaken following Ontario\u2019s enactment of the Green Energy and Green Economy Act of 2009 (\"GEGEA\") and the subsequent promulgation of additional rules and regulations, creating a Feed-in-Tariff (\"FIT\") program (the \"FIT Program\") for the development of renewable energy projects, including onshore and offshore wind. According to the Claimant, following the award of a Feed-in-Tariff Contract (the \"FIT Contract\") to the Claimant, the Government of Ontario (also referred to as the \"Government\" or \"Ontario\") delayed the approval of the required permits and authorizations, including those allowing access to Crown land, and eventually, on 11 February 2011, imposed a moratorium on the development of offshore wind that frustrated the Claimant\u2019s attempts to develop the Project.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the conduct of the Government, including the Ontario Power Authority (the \"OPA\"), is attributable to the Respondent and contends that the measures taken by Ontario authorities are inconsistent with the Respondent\u2019s obligations under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"), specifically Articles 1110 (Expropriation and Compensation), 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), 1102 (National Treatment), 1103 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment) and, to the extent that the OPA is a state enterprise as defined in NAFTA Article 1505, Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises).\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that it is in breach of any of its obligations under NAFTA. According to the Respondent, the Claimant was always aware of the regulatory risks related to the development of the regulatory processes and the significant scientific uncertainty regarding the effects of offshore wind projects on human health, safety and the environment. The Respondent contends that Ontario\u2019s decision to defer the development of offshore wind was taken to allow the necessary scientific research to be completed and applied to all such projects and thus was not discriminatory, and fell within the legitimate policy-making power of the Government of Ontario to regulate in the public interest.\n\n**C. The Parties\u2019 Requests for Relief**\n---------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimant requests the following relief:\n\n\"a) a declaration that Canada has unlawfully expropriated Windstream\u2019s investments in WWIS, the Project and the FIT Contract, contrary to Article 1110 of NAFTA;\n\nb) a declaration that Canada has failed to accord Windstream\u2019s investments fair and equitable treatment in accordance with international law, contrary to Article 1105 of NAFTA;\n\nc) a declaration that Canada has failed to accord Windstream\u2019s investments treatment no less favorable than that accorded, in like circumstances, to its own investors contrary to Article 1102 of NAFTA;\n\nd) a declaration that Canada has failed to accord Windstream\u2019s investments treatment no less favorable than that accorded, in like circumstances, to investors of any Party or non-Party, contrary to Article 1103 of NAFTA;\n\ne) alternatively, a declaration that Canada has breached Article 1503 of NAFTA;\n\nf) alternatively, a declaration that Canada has failed to ensure through regulatory control, administrative supervision or the application of other measures, that its state enterprise, the OPA, acts in a manner consistent with Canada\u2019s obligations under Chapter 11 of NAFTA;\n\ng) damages in the range of between CAD 357.5 and CAD 486.6 million, to be updated as at the time of the hearing, or alternatively between CAD 427.9 and CAD 568.5, to be updated as at the time of the hearing;\n\nh) pre-and post-award interest at a rate to be fixed by the Tribunal;\n\ni) all legal fees and costs associated with this arbitration; and\n\nj) such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate.\"1\n\n**Memorial,** para. 691; **Reply,** para. 746.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent requests:\n\n\"that the Tribunal dismiss the Claimant\u2019s claims in their entirety and with prejudice, order that the Claimant bear the costs of this arbitration, including Canada\u2019s costs for legal representation and assistance, and grant any further relief it deems just and proper.\"2\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 580; **Rejoinder,** para. 337.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Commencement of the Proceedings and Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n10.\n\nOn 17 October 2012, the Claimant served upon the Respondent a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration pursuant to Articles 1118 and 1119 of NAFTA.

The PCA designated Mr Hanno Wehland, PCA Legal Counsel, to act as the Secretary of the Tribunal.4\n\nOn 1 January 2016, following the resignation of Mr Wehland, Ms Jennifer Nettleton and Ms Claire de Tassigny Schuetze replaced Mr Wehland as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n15.\n\nOn 10 September 2013, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had reached \"an agreement on all of the remaining issues in Procedural Order No. 1\" and submitted to the Tribunal a final agreed draft of Procedural Order No. 1 as well as a final agreed draft of a Confidentiality Order.\n\n16.\n\nOn 16 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 which, *inter alia,* confirmed the proper constitution of the Tribunal and set the time frame for further proceedings. On the same day, the Tribunal also issued a Confidentiality Order.\n\n17.\n\nOn 6 November 2013, with the Respondent\u2019s agreement, the Claimant filed an Amended Notice of Arbitration pursuant to Article 22 of the UNCITRAL Rules. On 5 December 2013, with the Claimant\u2019s agreement, the Respondent filed an Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration.\n\n**B. Written Proceedings**\n--------------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn accordance with the procedural timetable, between 16 October 2013 and 2 December 2013, the Parties exchanged document production requests in the form of Redfern Schedules.\n\n19.\n\nOn 20 December 2013, the Claimant submitted its completed Redfern Schedule, setting out three document production requests to which the Respondent had objected and requesting a ruling from the Tribunal regarding the disputed requests. On the same day, the Respondent confirmed that there were no disputes relating to its document production requests left to be resolved by the Tribunal.\n\n20.\n\nOn 12 January 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, approving one request made by the Claimant and denying the other two requests.\n\n21.\n\nOn 14 April 2014, the Parties exchanged documents.\n\n22.\n\nOn 25 April 2014, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to amend the existing schedule of the proceedings. The Tribunal acknowledged and approved the Parties\u2019 agreement the following day.\n\n23.\n\nOn 19 August 2014, the Claimant submitted its Memorial with accompanying evidence.\n\n24.\n\nOn 30 September 2014, the Claimant submitted a corrected version of its Memorial fixing various typographical errors in the original version. The Claimant also submitted a revised Procedural Order No. 1 and a revised Confidentiality Order. On 1 October 2014, the Respondent confirmed its agreement with the proposed changes to Procedural Order No. 1 and the Confidentiality Order. On 2 October 2014, the Tribunal issued the revised Procedural Order No. 1 and the revised Confidentiality Order incorporating the amendments agreed by the Parties.\n\n25.\n\nOn 7 November 2014, the Claimant requested the Tribunal\u2019s \"assistance in connection with certain issues that have arisen among the parties during the document production process.\" According to the Claimant, the issues related to (a) a lack of documents produced by the Respondent from the Premier\u2019s Office of the Government of Ontario, and (b) discrepancies between the amount of documents produced by the Respondent from the Government of Ontario\u2019s Ministry of Natural Resources (\"MNR\"), Ministry of the Environment (\"MOE\") and Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure (\"MEI\"),5 when compared to the volume of documents obtained by the Claimant from these Ministries through access to information requests. The Claimant requested the Tribunal to issue various procedural orders to address these issues.\n\nAs the Claimant notes, \"[b]etween 2007 and 2010, the Ministry was known as the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure. It is now known as the Ministry of Energy.\" **Memorial,** para. 67 (n. 67).\n\n26.\n\nRegarding the first issue, the Claimant requested that, \"in lieu of documentary discovery, the Premier\u2019s Office staff member who was the most closely involved with the decision to implement the moratorium be compelled to attend an examination for discovery in Toronto to answer questions about that decision, and the decision to apply the moratorium to Windstream.\" In this respect, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to order as follows:\n\n\"1) Canada shall disclose the identity of the individual from the Premier\u2019s Office who was most directly involved with the decision to implement the moratorium on offshore wind development (whether it is Mr Mullin, Mr Steeve, Mr Morley or another individual);\"\n\n2) \"The individual identified by Canada shall appear before a certified court reporter in Toronto, Ontario to be examined for discovery by counsel for Windstream to answer questions relating to the decision to implement the moratorium on offshore wind development;\" and\n\n3) \"If that individual will not appear voluntarily to be examined for discovery, the Tribunal grants Windstream its approval to seek an order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for assistance in compelling the attendance of the individual.\"\n\n4) Alternatively to the above requests, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to order that \"the Premier\u2019s Office [shall] restore the available back-up tapes and search the resulting restored documents for documents responsive to Claimant\u2019s document request #25.\"6\n\n**Procedural Order No. 3,** dated 21 January 2015, para. 2.11.\n\n27.\n\nRegarding the second issue, the Claimant contended that the fact that it had received through two requests made under Ontario\u2019s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act a number of documents from the MNR that \"(1) [were] responsive to Windstream\u2019s document requests, and (2) were not included in Canada\u2019s productions... calls into question the comprehensiveness of Canada\u2019s searches for documents.\" In this respect, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to order the Respondent to:\n\n\"1) Disclose to Windstream and to the Tribunal the search processes it used to identify documents responsive to document requests #22, 27, 28, 29 and 56;\"\n\n2) \"Identify, and disclose to Windstream and to the Tribunal, the lacunae in its search processes that led to the above documents not being produced in response to document requests #22, 27, 28, 29 and 56;\" and\n\n3) \"Conduct any further and better searches for documents responsive to requests #22, 27, 28, 29 and 56 as may be agreed with Windstream, or ordered by the Tribunal failing such agreement.\"7\n\n**Procedural Order No. 3,** dated 21 January 2015, para. 2.12.\n\n28.\n\nOn 18 November 2014, the Respondent provided comments on the Claimant\u2019s requests.\n\n29.\n\nOn 24 November 2014, the Claimant submitted a reply to the Respondent\u2019s comments.\n\n30.\n\nOn 28 November 2014, the Respondent submitted a rejoinder to the Claimant\u2019s reply.\n\n31.\n\nOn 15 December 2014, the Tribunal requested the Respondent to clarify whether it was in a position to identify the individual in the former Premier\u2019s Office who was most directly involved in the decision on the moratorium on offshore wind development.\n\n32.\n\nOn 18 December 2014, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that at this time it was not in a position to do so and that it would update the Tribunal on its progress in this regard by 7 January 2015.\n\n33.\n\nOn 22 December 2014, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that \"new information\" relevant to its requests had been disclosed as a result of a legal proceeding in Ontario, requesting an opportunity to submit it to the Tribunal. On 23 December 2014, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide its comments on the Claimant\u2019s communication of 22 December 2014 by 30 December 2014. At the Respondent\u2019s request, the Tribunal extended this deadline until 7 January 2015.\n\n34.\n\nOn 7 January 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was \"not able to identify an individual in the former [Premier\u2019s Office] who was directly involved in making the deferral/moratorium decision.\" In the same communication to the Tribunal, the Respondent objected to the Claimant\u2019s request to submit the \"new information.\"\n\n35.\n\nOn 8 January 2015, the Tribunal decided to allow the Claimant to submit the \"new information\" referred to in the Claimant\u2019s communication of 22 December 2014 and to give an opportunity to the Respondent to respond to the Claimant\u2019s submission.\n\n36.\n\nOn 9 January 2015, the Claimant submitted a search warrant issued by an Ontario judicial officer authorizing the search of the premises of the Ontario Provincial Government Cyber Security Branch, including the email accounts of, among others, Mr David Livingston, the former Chief of Staff to Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty as the \"new information\" previously referred to. The Claimant also requested that, should the Tribunal decide to make the order requested by the Claimant in its letter of 7 November 2014, such order should name Mr Sean Mullin - who acted as Deputy Director of Policy responsible for the energy portfolio at the former Premier\u2019s Office - as the appropriate witness to appear for discovery voluntarily or, if necessary, by being compelled to do so.\n\n37.\n\nOn 14 January 2015, the Respondent submitted further observations on the Claimant\u2019s requests and requested the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimant\u2019s motion in its entirety.\n\n38.\n\nOn 20 January 2015, the Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial with accompanying evidence.\n\n39.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondent requested that, given the pending dispute between the Parties as to what is confidential in the Claimant\u2019s submissions, the timelines in paragraph 2 of the Confidentiality Order be suspended and that the Tribunal order the Respondent to designate confidential information in its written submissions within ten days from the date on which the disagreements between the Parties regarding the confidentiality designations in the Claimant\u2019s submissions had been resolved.\n\n40.\n\nThe Respondent also asserted parliamentary privilege with respect to certain information relied on by the Claimant in its written submissions and informed the Tribunal that it would be bringing a motion for an order to strike this material from the record.\n\n41.\n\nOn 21 January 2015, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide its comments regarding the Respondent\u2019s request relating to the suspension of timelines in paragraph 2 of the Revised Confidentiality Order and the designation of confidential information by 26 January 2015.\n\n42.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, deciding the Claimant\u2019s requests of 7 November 2014. On the basis of the Parties\u2019 submissions, the Tribunal decided as follows:\n\n\"a) The Claimant\u2019s request that the Respondent be ordered to disclose the identity of the individual from the Premier\u2019s Office who was most directly involved with the decision to implement the moratorium on offshore wind development is dismissed as moot.\n\nb) The Claimant\u2019s request that the individual identified by the Claimant shall appear before a certified court reporter in Toronto, Ontario, to be examined for discovery by counsel for the Claimant to answer questions relating to the decision to implement the moratorium on offshore wind development is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\n\nc) The Claimant\u2019s request that if the individual identified by the Claimant will not appear voluntarily to be examined for discovery, the Tribunal grants the Claimant its approval to seek an order from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for assistance in compelling the attendance of the individual, is granted.\n\nd) The Claimant\u2019s alternative request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to restore the available back-up tapes and search the restored documents for documents responsive to the Claimant\u2019s document request #25 is denied...\n\ne) The Claimant\u2019s request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to disclose to the Claimant and to the Tribunal the search processes it used to identify the documents responsive to documents requests #22, 27, 28, 29, and 56 is denied.\n\nf) The Claimant\u2019s request that the Respondent identify and disclose to the Claimant and to the Tribunal the lacunae in its search processes that led to the documents not being produced in response to document requests #22, 27, 28, 29, and 56 is denied; and\n\ng) The Claimant\u2019s request that the Respondent conduct further and better searches for documents responsive to requests #22, 27, 28, 29, and 56, as may be agreed with the Claimant, or ordered by the Tribunal failing such agreement, is denied.\"\n\n43.\n\nOn 26 January 2015, the Claimant indicated that it had no objection to the Respondent\u2019s requests regarding the suspension of timelines in paragraph 2 of the Revised Confidentiality Order and the designation of confidential information.\n\n44.\n\nOn 27 January 2015, the Tribunal suspended the timelines in paragraph 2 of the Confidentiality Order for the filing of the Respondent\u2019s confidentiality designations, and ordered that the Respondent designate confidential information in its written submissions within ten days from the date upon which the disagreements over designations in the Claimant\u2019s submissions have been resolved.\n\n45.\n\nOn 6 February 2015, the Respondent submitted a motion to the Tribunal, requesting that certain information and exhibits listed in an annex attached to the motion be disregarded and excluded from the record. On 9 February 2015, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide its comments on the Respondent\u2019s motion by 13 February 2015. On 13 February 2015, the Claimant submitted a response to the Respondent\u2019s motion, requesting that it be dismissed.\n\n46.\n\nOn 12 February 2015, the Parties agreed on certain modifications regarding the time frame for the further proceedings. The Tribunal subsequently confirmed the revised procedural calendar.\n\n47.\n\nOn 23 February 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, denying the Respondent\u2019s request of 6 February 2015 that certain information and exhibits be disregarded and excluded from the evidence on the grounds of parliamentary privilege or political sensitivity.\n\n48.\n\nOn 5 March 2015, the Claimant submitted a redacted version of its Memorial.\n\n49.\n\nOn 30 March 2015, the Claimant wrote to Mr Bishop to request some clarification concerning a disclosure made by the Respondent\u2019s expert, Mr Christopher Goncalves, in his report regarding his engagement in other matters in which Mr Bishop has acted as counsel or arbitrator. On 23 April 2015, Mr Bishop confirmed that Mr Goncalves was acting as an expert for a party represented by Mr Bishop.\n\n50.\n\nOn 28 April 2015, the Claimant submitted a Supplementary Request to Produce (the \"Supplementary Request\"), requesting the Tribunal to \"order the Respondent to produce the documents set out in the [Supplementary Request]... as soon as possible and in any event no later than within 30 days of the Tribunal\u2019s decision on any disputed document request.\" On 29 April 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that it would respond to the Supplementary Request within five business days pursuant to Section 12.1 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n51.\n\nOn 5 May 2015, the Respondent submitted a response to the Supplementary Request.\n\n52.\n\nOn 6 May 2015, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal requesting a conference call \"to address some of the issues raised in Canada\u2019s letter and other issues related to document productions by Canada and Ontario.\" The Respondent objected to the Claimant\u2019s request by email of the same date.\n\n53.\n\nOn 8 May 2015, the Respondent produced certain additional documents to the Claimant.8\n\n**Reply, para. 48.**\n\n54.\n\nOn 13 May 2015, the Respondent submitted a redacted version of its Counter-Memorial.\n\n55.\n\nOn 14 May 2015, the Parties jointly requested that certain amendments be made to the procedural calendar. On 15 May 2015, the Tribunal noted and confirmed the amendments to the procedural calendar requested by the Parties.\n\n56.\n\nOn 15 May 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, denying the Supplementary Request and noting that its decision was \"without prejudice to [the Tribunal\u2019s] authority to order further production of documents on its own motion if so required, in accordance with Section 7.6 of Procedural Order No. 1.\" On 25 May 2015, following a request by the Claimant and in the absence of any objections from the Respondent, the Tribunal issued a revised version of Procedural Order No. 5.\n\n57.\n\nOn 22 June 2015, the Claimant submitted its Reply Memorial with accompanying evidence. On 8 July 2015, the Claimant submitted an Addendum to the second expert report of Messrs Richard Taylor and Robert Low of Deloitte LLP (\"Deloitte\") (submitted with its Reply Memorial) to correct \"three errors in the Economic Losses model.\"9\n\n**CER-Taylor/Low-2** (Addendum), p. 1.\n\n58.\n\nOn 30 September 2015, the Claimant submitted a redacted version of its Reply Memorial.\n\n59.\n\nOn 6 November 2015, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder Memorial with accompanying evidence.\n\n60.\n\nOn December 17, 2015, Mr Bishop notified the Parties that he had appeared as counsel in cases in which he or his firm had used the same experts as the Parties. He noted that he did not believe this to fall within any of the grounds for disclosure in the 2014 International Bar Association *Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration* and indicated that he was only raising it \"as a matter of caution.\" He further noted that this would not affect his impartiality or independence.\n\n61.\n\nOn 13 January 2016, the United States and Mexico, in their capacities as State parties to NAFTA, each filed a submission pursuant to Article 1128 of NAFTA. According to Article 1128, \"[o]n written notice to the disputing parties, a Party may make submissions to a Tribunal on a question of interpretation of this Agreement.\"\n\n62.\n\nOn 18 January 2016, the Respondent submitted a redacted version of its Rejoinder Memorial.\n\n63.\n\nOn 28 January 2016, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal requesting an opportunity to make submissions as to whether the Respondent should be required to disclose documents and information relied on by its experts (Green Giraffe and Berkeley Research Group (\"BRG\")) that were not submitted as exhibits with its Rejoinder. On 29 January 2016, the Tribunal confirmed that the Claimant could make the requested submissions by 2 February 2016, and set 5 February 2016 as the deadline for any reply by the Respondent.\n\n64.\n\nOn 29 January 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent each submitted a Reply to the Article 1128 Submissions of the United States and Mexico.\n\n65.\n\nOn 2 February 2016, the Claimant filed its submissions, requesting that the Tribunal order the Respondent to produce, subject to the Confidentiality Order, the documents and information relied on by its experts, Green Giraffe and BRG, to support certain statements that they made in their respective expert reports. The Claimant also requested that, if the Respondent did not produce the requested documents and information, the Tribunal exclude the relevant portions of the expert reports from the record or alternatively afford them no weight. On 5 February 2016, the Respondent submitted its response to the Claimant\u2019s submissions.\n\n66.\n\nOn 8 February 2016, the Tribunal declined to grant the Claimant\u2019s request that the Respondent be ordered to produce the documents and information relied on by Green Giraffe and BRG. The Tribunal noted that it would \"take into account, when assessing the weight to be given to the expert evidence in question in accordance with Article 27(4) of the UNCITRAF Rules, the fact that some of the underlying evidence and information has not been made available.\"\n\n67.\n\nOn 14 February 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent submitted the Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology.\n\n68.\n\nOn 11 April 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent each submitted their respective Costs Submissions.\n\n69.\n\nOn 26 April 2016, the Claimant and the Respondent each submitted their respective Reply Costs Submissions.\n\n70.\n\nOn 18 May 2016, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal stating that the Parties had agreed to certain corrections to the Claimant\u2019s Reply Memorial and requesting that the Tribunal grant it permission to produce a letter from Mr Ian Irvine of SgurrEnergy correcting a typographical error in the Second Expert Report submitted by SgurrEnergy. The Claimant indicated that the Respondent had not consented to the request.\n\n71.\n\nOn 20 May 2016, the Respondent submitted its comments on the Claimant\u2019s request.\n\n72.\n\nOn 23 May 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to allow the Claimant to produce the letter from Mr Irvine, and invited the Respondent to comment on the letter within five business days of its production. The Tribunal indicated that its decision was without prejudice to its determination as to whether the correction related to a typographical error, and whether any further procedural steps might be required.\n\n73.\n\nOn the same day, the Claimant produced the letter from Mr Irvine.\n\n74.\n\nOn 27 May 2016, the Respondent submitted its comments on Mr Irvine\u2019s letter.\n\n75.\n\nOn 28 May 2016, the Claimant requested an opportunity to file a brief response to the Respondent\u2019s letter. Upon the Tribunal\u2019s approval, the Claimant filed its response on 31 May 2016.\n\n76.\n\nOn 2 June 2016, the Respondent commented on the Claimant\u2019s letter of 31 May 2016.\n\n77.\n\nOn 3 June 2016, the Tribunal decided to admit Mr Irvine\u2019s letter into evidence, without prejudice to its ultimate determination as to the evidentiary value of the letter. The Tribunal indicated that it did not consider it necessary to re-open the hearings at this stage.\n\n78.\n\nOn 15 June 2016, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal requesting directions with respect to an oral request it had received from the Ontario Provincial Police (\"OPP\") for documents produced, or produced and filed as exhibits, in this arbitration. The Claimant stated that it had been unable to resolve the issue with the Respondent.\n\n79.\n\nOn 21 June 2016, the Respondent commented on the Claimant\u2019s request, stating that the request was premature because the OPP had not yet put its oral request in writing and also unnecessary because the Claimant had not requested the Respondent\u2019s consent to disclose any information.\n\n80.\n\nOn 3 July 2016, the Tribunal noted that there had been no formal, written request from the OPP, and that accordingly it was unclear whether the OPP\u2019s request covered information that could be considered confidential under the Tribunal\u2019s Confidentiality Order. Noting the Respondent\u2019s offer to cooperate with the Claimant in an effort to resolve any issues that might arise, the Tribunal considered that it was neither necessary nor appropriate for it to issue any directions as there was, as yet, no concrete issue to be resolved by the Tribunal.\n\n**C. Oral Proceedings**\n-----------------------\n\n81.\n\nOn 22 January 2016, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing teleconference with the Parties. Prior to the teleconference, the Parties had notified the Tribunal of certain procedural and organizational issues on which they had reached agreement and provided a list of issues on which they were unable to agree. The two outstanding issues related to the introduction of new documents during the examination or cross-examination of witnesses at the hearing, and the use of PowerPoint presentations by experts at the hearing. On 25 January 2016, the Tribunal issued its decision on the two outstanding issues and provided a schedule for the hearing.\n\n82.\n\nAn oral hearing was held on 15-19 and 21-26 February 2016 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The availability of the live video feed was notified to the public in a PCA press release on 1 February 2016.\n\n85.\n\nPrior to the hearing, on 11 January 2016, and in response to the Parties\u2019 joint request, the Tribunal sent the Parties a list of questions to be addressed by them during their oral arguments. During the hearing the Tribunal sent further questions to the Parties.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. The Regulatory Framework Governing Renewable Energy in Ontario**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nIn 2003, the Government of Ontario determined that without increasing electricity supply in the Province of Ontario, it would run a risk of electricity shortages.10 At the same time, the Government felt that the Province\u2019s dependence on coal-fired power plants as an energy source gave rise to health and environmental concerns.11 Consequently, Ontario started exploring the use of alternative and renewable sources of electricity generation12 and adopting policies to promote renewable energy development.13 In the same year, Ontario\u2019s Premier announced a plan to close Ontario\u2019s coal-fired power plants.14\n\n**Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration,** para. 10; **Reply,** para. 64.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 36.\n\n**Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration,** para. 12.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 80.\n\n**Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 1 (citing Article, Spears, John (Toronto Star), Ontario Coal-Burning Power Plants to Close This Year of 10 January 2003 **(C-1090)).**\n\n87.\n\nIn 2004, Ontario enacted the Electricity Restructuring Act that amended the Electricity Act of 1998, establishing *inter alia* the OPA as \"an independent non-share capital corporation responsible for medium and long-term system planning, conservation, demand management and procurement of new generation through long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs).\"15 The OPA had separate legal personality and could enter into electricity procurement contracts.16 The Minister of Energy could direct the OPA to undertake specific actions regarding its electricity procurement programs, but the Electricity Act specified that the OPA was \"not an agent of the Crown.\"17\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 39; **Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration,** para. 12.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 40.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** paras. 39, 41 (referring to the *Electricity Act, 1998* **(C-3),** Part II.1, s. 25.3).\n\n88.\n\nBetween 2003 and 2008, Ontario and the OPA ran a number of procurement programs to encourage the desired use of alternative and renewable energy sources. However, all these initiatives failed to produce the required level of new investment.18 On 1 January 2015, the OPA was merged with the Independent Electricity System Operator (\"IESO\") and the new entity kept working under the IESO name.19\n\n**Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration,** paras. 13-14.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 34.\n\n89.\n\nIn Ontario, all lakebeds (with one exception that is not relevant) are Crown land.20 The MNR, among other things, exercises regulatory authority on behalf of Ontario for granting access to Crown land for offshore wind development.21 In March 2003, the MNR released for public comment a draft policy on the disposition of Crown land (including the beds of the Great Lakes) for wind energy development.22 In March 2004, the draft policy was finalized, and the MNR subsequently issued it as Policy Number 4.10.04, Wind Power Development on Crown Land (\"Wind Policy 4.10.04\").23 Wind Policy 4.10.04 established for the first time a set of standardized rules for wind developers to apply for the use of Crown land.24 Between 2004 and 2006, the MNR engaged in research regarding the potential environmental effects of offshore wind energy projects.25\n\n**Memorial,** para. 132\n\n**Amended Notice of Arbitration,** para. 16; **Memorial,** para. 74.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 80.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 81.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 133.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 81 (referring to **CER-Powell,** para. 63).\n\n90.\n\nIn November 2006, the MNR decided to defer its consideration of applications for access to Crown land to develop offshore wind power.26 In light of the \"relatively little experience with understanding the positive and negative social and economic effects associated\" with wind power, this deferral was meant to allow the further study of the effects of offshore wind as a source of energy generation.27\n\n**Memorial,** para. 86.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 86 (referring to Issues Management Plan (MNR), Offshore Wind Power - Temporary Deferral of 17 January 2011 **(C-460)); Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 1 (citing Letter from Boysen, Eric (MNR) to Proponent Address of 21 November 2006 **(C-13)).**\n\n91.\n\nIn January 2008, following \"considerable activity on the policy and resource analysis front,\" the MNR determined that the existing policy and Environmental Assessment processes \"[were] sufficient to address site-specific issues and concerns related to offshore wind.\"28 On 16 January 2008, the Premier of Ontario, Mr Dalton McGuinty, informed the local media that \"offshore wind could play an important role in the development of renewable energy resources in Ontario.\"29 He also stated that offshore wind power could be harnessed \"in a way that does not compromise ecosystems.\"30 On 17 January 2008, the MNR announced the lifting of the deferral decision of November 2006.31\n\n**Memorial,** para. 90 (citing House Note (MNR), Issue: Lifting of the Off-Shore Wind Power Deferral of 3 January 2008 **(C-52)).**\n\n**Memorial,** para. 88 (referring to Article, Hamilton, Tyler (Toronto Star), Premier Reveals Support for Offshore Energy Plan of 16 January 2008 **(C-56)); Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 1 (also citing **(C-56)).**\n\n**Reply,** para. 193 (citing Article, Hamilton, Tyler (Toronto Star), Premier Reveals Support for Offshore Energy Plan of 16 January 2008 **(C-56),** p. 1). *See also* **Reply,** paras. 194-195.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 87; Press Release (MNR), Ontario Lays Foundation for Offshore Wind Power of 17 January 2008 **(C-58); Reply,** paras. 59, 191; **Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 1 (also citing **(C-58)).**\n\n92.\n\nThe lifting of the deferral meant that new applications for access to offshore Crown land would be reviewed by the MNR.32 On 28 January 2008, Wind Policy 4.10.04 was updated and reissued to include offshore wind, and guidelines were published regarding the application of the Policy.33 On 23 April 2008, Ms Donna Cansfield, the Minister of Natural Resources, stated at an energy conference:\n\n\"For the past two years we\u2019ve been assessing potential benefits and impacts of this technology. Our research made it clear that developing offshore wind potential would be practical and environmentally sound once the appropriate infrastructure is in place. As a result, we were able to lift the deferral last January and began accepting applications for exploration proposals.\"34\n\n**Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration,** para. 23; **Memorial,** para. 87; **Reply,** para. 59; **Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 1.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 87; **Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 1 (citing Policy No. PL 4.10.04 (MNR) of 28 January 2008 **(C-60);** Policy No. PL 4.10.04 (MNR), Wind Power Site Release and Development Review - Crown Land of 28 January 2008 **(C-59)).**\n\n**Reply,** para. 192 (citing Remarks by Natural Resources Minister Cansfield, Donna to the Energy 2100 of 23 April 2008 **(C-761),** pp. 16-17).\n\n93.\n\nOn 30 June 2008, Minister Cansfield was quoted in the Toronto Star newspaper to the effect \"that Ontario was \u2018open for business\u2019 when it comes to offshore wind.\"35 On 29 October 2008, at the annual Ontario Waterpower Conference, Minister Cansfield gave a speech in which she confirmed that \"timely approval of applications to use Crown land for offshore wind energy development could be expected by those submitting applications.\"36\n\n**Memorial,** para. 91 (citing Email from Cooper, John (MNR) to Morencie, Mike (MNR) et al. attaching Toronto Star Article of 30 June 2008 **(C-81)).**\n\n**Memorial,** para. 98 (referring to **CWS-Baines,** para. 96).\n\n94.\n\nOn 20 February 2009, the Ontario Government announced a proposal to enact the GEGEA.37 The Government described the proposal as \"sweeping new legislation to attract new investment, create new green economy jobs and better protect the climate.\"38 On the same date, the Deputy Premier, Minister George Smitherman, explained before the Toronto Board of Trade that the GEGEA meant that Ontario would \"offer an attractive price for renewable power, including wind - onshore and offshore... and we\u2019ll guarantee the price for decades.\"39\n\n**Memorial,** para. 100; **Reply,** para. 71; **Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 2 (citing News Release, Smitherman, George (MEI), The Green Economy of 20 February 2009 **(C-110)).**\n\n**Memorial,** para. 100 (citing News Release (Ministry of Energy), Ontario\u2019s Bold New Plan for a Green Economy of 23 February 2009 **(C-115)).**\n\n**Memorial,** para. 103 (citing News Release, Smitherman, George (MEI), The Green Economy of 20 February 2009 **(C-110)); Reply,** para. 71.\n\n95.\n\nOn 21 February 2009, the Toronto Star newspaper published an interview with Minister Smitherman in which he stated that there were \"wonderful opportunities for offshore wind\" and the Government had been \"making sure we\u2019ll move those proposals along.\"40 On 23 February 2009, Minister Smitherman gave a speech at the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in which he stated that the GEGEA \"would make Ontario the \u2018destination of choice\u2019 for green power developers, would \u2018incent proponents large and small to develop projects by offering an attractive price renewable energy\u2019 and would provide \u2018the certainty that creates an attractive investment climate.\u2019\"41 He also stated that the GEGEA \"would coordinate approvals from the Ministries of the Environment and Natural Resources into a streamlined process with a service guarantee,\"42 adding that \"so long as all necessary documentation is successfully completed, permits would be issued within a six-month service window.\"43\n\n**Reply,** para. 71 (citing Article, Hamilton, Tyler (Toronto Star), Province to Fast-Track Wind Turbine Projects of 21 February 2009 **(C-lll),** p. 2).\n\n**Memorial,** para. 161 (citing Legislative Assembly of Ontario (Hansard Transcript), Smitherman, George Statement of 23 February 2009 **(C-116)); Reply,** paras. 70, 79.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 100 (citing News Release, Smitherman, George (MEI), The Green Economy of 20 February 2009 **(C-110)); Reply,** para. 70.\n\n**Reply,** para. 84 (citing Legislative Assembly of Ontario (Hansard Transcript), Smitherman, George, Statement of 23 February 2009 **(C-116),** p. 2).\n\n96.\n\nOn 14 May 2009, the GEGEA was approved.44 The GEGEA introduced the FIT Program and consolidated many of the provincial environmental approvals for renewable energy projects into a streamlined approval process, the Renewable Energy Approval (\"REA\") process, making the MOE the primary regulator in the renewable energy sector45\n\n**Memorial,** para. 105 (referring to *An Act to enact the Green Energy Act of2009 and to build a green economy, to repeal the Energy Conservation Leadership Act of 2006 and the Energy Efficiency Act and to amend other statutes* **(C-123)); Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 2 (also citing **(C-123)).**\n\n**Memorial,** para. 102; **Counter-Memorial,** para. 7.\n\n97.\n\nThe GEGEA authorized the MEI to direct the OPA to develop the FIT Program.

**Reply,** para. 204.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 116.\n\n105.\n\nThe FIT application process was identical for onshore and offshore wind projects.69 The initial FIT application period was opened by the OPA from 1 October 2009 to 30 November 2009.70 It generated significant interest from renewable energy investors around the world, receiving 454 applications in total.71 Offshore wind projects accounted for only a few applications: in addition to the Claimant\u2019s application, only one other proponent filed a complete and eligible FIT application for an offshore wind project.72 In response to this first round of applications, the OPA offered 186 FIT Contracts.73\n\n**Memorial,** para. 131.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 131; **Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 3 (citing Report (OPA), FIT Program - Backgrounder of April 2010 **(C-208)).**\n\n**Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration,** para. 17.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 173.\n\n**Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration,** para. 17.\n\n106.\n\nAccording to the GEGEA, an offshore wind project proponent had to meet four requirements: (i) obtain a FIT Contract; (ii) obtain access to Crown land; (iii) obtain an REA; and (iv) obtain a grid-connection approval from the IESO (an entity that monitors the operation of Ontario\u2019s power system and ensures its reliability).74\n\n**Memorial,** para. 130.\n\n107.\n\nIn particular, project proponents building on Crown land had to apply for the \"release\" of the applicable sections of Crown land for wind testing and project construction and operation.75 The process of applying for permission to test or build on Crown land was called the Site Release process, and a project proponent obtaining Site Release was referred to as an Applicant of Record (\"AOR\").76 When the FIT Program was launched, the MNR had a three-stage process for establishing a wind project on Crown land under Wind Policy 4.10.04: (i) wind power testing application and review; (ii) wind power development review; and (iii) issuing permits and tenure for development of a wind farm on Crown land.77 The first two stages represented the Site Release process, through which the applicants for Crown land sought to obtain an AOR status in respect of specific \"grid cells\" or groupings of grid cells of Crown land. Obtaining an AOR status allowed an applicant to proceed to the third stage, at which it could request the permits and approvals necessary for the development of the wind project.78 AOR status gave sole right to apply for permits and approvals with respect to particular grid cells of Crown land,79 but was \"not a disposition\" and still required completion of \"all [e]nvironmental [assessment requirements for the proposal prior to any authorizations or approvals being issued.\"80\n\n**Memorial,** para. 132.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 132.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 151.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 151\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 152.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 153 (citing Policy No. PL 4.10.04 (MNR) of 28 January 2008 **(C-60)).**\n\n108.\n\nOn 21 October 2009, Minister Cansfield gave a speech at a conference on Offshore Wind Energy in Coastal North America and the Great Lakes, stating:\n\n\"In 2006, my ministry placed a deferral on proposals for Great Lakes offshore development. We needed to get a better understanding of how offshore wind turbines might affect the surrounding environment. We also needed to assess the potential benefits and impacts of this technology. Our research made it clear that developing offshore wind potential would be practical and environmentally sound once the appropriate infrastructure is in place. As a result, the deferral was lifted in January [2008] and the province began accepting applications for project proposals.81\n\n[W]e know that when it comes to new investment, one of the most important factors for investors is certainty. When companies know exactly what the rules are it instills greater confidence to invest in Ontario, hire workers and produce self-renewable energy.82\n\nOffshore windpower is included in the Feed-in-Tariff program at 19 cents per kilowatt hour. Ontario is the first jurisdiction in North America to set a price for offshore windpower, reflecting our strong support for exploring offshore potential.\"83\n\n**Memorial,** para. 127 (citing Event Note (MNR), Offshore Wind Energy In Coastal North America and the Great Lakes Conference of 21 October 2009 **(C-147)).**\n\n**Reply,** para. 105 (citing Event Note (MNR), Offshore Wind Energy In Coastal North America and the Great Lakes Conference of 21 October 2009 **(C-147)).**\n\n**Reply,** para. 105 (citing Event Note (MNR), Offshore Wind Energy In Coastal North America and the Great Lakes Conference of 21 October 2009 **(C-147)); Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 3 (also citing **(C-147)).**\n\n109.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Canadian Wind Energy Association dated 24 November 2009, the Assistant Deputy Minister from the MNR, Ms Rosalyn Lawrence, stated:\n\n\"Existing Crown land applicants who apply to FIT during the launch period, and who are awarded contracts by the OPA, will be given the highest priority to the Crown land sites applied for. This means that these applications will take precedence over all others for this site, and will receive priority attention from MNR.\"84\n\n**Memorial,** para. 163 (citing Letter from Lawrence, Rosalyn (MNR) to Homung, Robert (Canadian Wind Energy Association) of 24 November 2009 **(C-158)); Parties\u2019 Joint Chronology,** p. 3 (also citing **(C-158)).**\n\n110.\n\nThe letter also specified that \"an application for Crown land does not create a legal entitlement or confer rights\" and that \"the Minister of Natural Resources has the sole authority to approve or deny any application for the use of Crown land to support wind power testing or development.\"85\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 163 (citing Letter from Lawrence, Rosalyn (MNR) to Homung, Robert (Canadian Wind Energy Association) of 24 November 2009 **(C-158)).**\n\n111.\n\nThe approvals process under the REA Regulation consists of several steps. First a project proponent had to conduct certain \"pre-submission activities,\" including submitting to the MOE a draft project description report,86 conducting consultations with stakeholders and preparing a consultation report,87 and conducting a natural heritage assessment88 as well as a water assessment.89 The proponent then had to submit its application with the necessary accompanying materials to the MOE.90 If the application was found to be complete, it was reviewed by a team of inter-ministerial experts led by the MOE\u2019s Environmental Approvals Branch to determine if the application met the regulatory requirements and \"whether or not there [was] adequate information to allow the [MOE] Director to make a decision in the public interest to issue or not issue a REA.\"91 Once the technical review had been completed, the Director of the MOE was to make \"an independent and discretionary determination of whether or not it [was] in the public interest to issue a REA.\"92 Subsequently, the applicant and any resident of Ontario might appeal that decision to the Environmental Review Tribunal.93\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** paras. 82-83.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 94.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 96.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 103.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 104.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 105.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 106.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 109.\n\n112.\n\nRenewable energy proponents of projects larger than ten megawatts (\"MW\") were also required to obtain a connection assessment, which included an IESO System Impact Assessment (\"SIA\") and a Customer Impact Assessment (\"CIA\") from the relevant transmitter.94 The purpose of the SIA was to assess the impact of a project on Ontario\u2019s integrated power system,95 while the purpose of the CIA was to assess the impact of the connection of a new project to the power grid on existing customers.96\n\n**Memorial,** para. 141.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 142.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 143.\n\n113.\n\nA project could only start after issuance of a Notice to Proceed (\"NTP\") by the OPA pursuant to Section 2.4 of the standard FIT Contract once the following requirements had been met: (i) receipt of the REA; (ii) submission of a financing plan including signed commitment letters from sources of financing representing at least 50% of the expected development costs; and (iii) submission of a domestic content plan explaining that the Project would meet a 50% Ontario content requirement.97\n\n**Memorial,** para. 181.\n\n114.\n\nOn 1 March 2010, the MOE posted one of the aforementioned EBR notices entitled \"Renewable Energy Approval Technical Guidance Bulletins\" with six attached technical bulletins including \"Technical Bulletin Six: Required Setbacks for Wind Turbines.\"98\n\n**Reply,** para. 207 (referring to Report (MOE), Renewal Energy Approvals, Technical Bulletin One, Guidance for Preparing the Project Description Report of 1 March 2010 **(C-189);** Report (MOE), Renewal Energy Approvals, Technical Bulletin Two, Guidance for Preparing the Design and Operations Report of 1 March 2010 **(C-190);** Report (MOE), Renewal Energy Approvals, Technical Bulletin Three, Guidance for Preparing the Construction Plan Report of 1 March 2010 **(C-191);** Report (MOE), Renewal Energy Approvals, Technical Bulletin Four, Guidance for Preparing the Decommissioning Plan Report of 1 March 2010 **(C-192);** Report (MOE), Renewal Energy Approvals, Technical Bulletin Five, Guidance for Preparing the Consultation Report of 1 March 2010 **(C-193);** Report (MOE), Renewable Energy Approvals, Technical Bulletin Six, Required Setbacks for Wind Turbines of 1 March 2010 **(C-194));

We acknowledge that your project is unique in that it has a FIT Contract and so that end Perry [of the OPA] is here but we\u2019ve asked that the OPA sit down with you to negotiate a number of pieces including the force majeure provisions, the two-year force majeure termination clause associated with those provisions and the security deposits...,185\n\n[Brenda Lucas of MOE:] We came out at the end of the summer as you know and we\u2019ve proposed five fifty and did the EBR consultation and we had over 1400 people write in and we have a lot more questions than we have answers so the concern from the Environment Ministry\u2019s perspective is a lot of questions, not enough information, not enough science to build an offshore specific REA regulation and similarly questions about how we would evaluate the reports and studies that any individual project brought in to us in terms of how they would be able to mitigate any of those concerns from you know fish and fish habitat to ice, freeze and thaw issues to noise issues over water, there\u2019s just like I said, too much uncertainty for us to go forward on that now, so our part of the news today essentially is that we\u2019re not ready with the REA regulation.

The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) The level of uncertainty regarding the regulatory framework**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimant contends that there was sufficient regulatory certainty at the time it decided to invest in Ontario.220 On 24 September 2009, when the FIT Program was launched, the MNR sent a letter to the Claimant acknowledging its Crown land applications and stating that WWIS was required to submit a FIT application within the initial FIT application period in order to maintain the priority position of its AOR application.221 The press release announcing the launch of the FIT Program and the GEGEA also indicated that Ontario provided \"a stable investment environment where companies know what the rules are - giving them confidence to invest in Ontario.\"222 It was generally understood among developers that the MNR would align \"its Site Release process and timelines with the OPA\u2019s renewable energy procurement process.\"223\n\n**Memorial,** para. 428.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 163.\n\n**Reply,** para. 77 (citing Article, Green Energy Rules Make Ontario a North American Leader of 24 September 2009 **(C-143),** p. 1).\n\n**Memorial,** para. 428 (citing **CER-Powell,** paras. 106-107).\n\n162.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the overall REA framework fully applies to offshore wind, including classified facilities and offshore wind facilities.224 According to the Claimant, the MOE document released on 20 September 2009, which explained to offshore proponents how to meet MOE\u2019s requirements for offshore wind projects under the REA Regulation, made it clear that REA applications for offshore wind projects would be assessed based on site-specific considerations.225 Accordingly, the REA Regulation provided the Claimant with reasonable certainty regarding the required regulatory assessment process for the Project.226\n\nHearing Transcript (17 February 2016), 14:3-6.\n\n**Reply,** para. 203.\n\n**Reply,** para. 198 (citing **CER-Powell,** paras. 95-102).\n\n163.\n\nThe Claimant submits that in deciding to apply for a FIT Contract it relied on the MNR\u2019s letter of 24 September 2009, along with another letter from Minister Cansfield and Minister Smitherman\u2019s February 2009 speech.227\n\n**Memorial,** para. 161.\n\n164.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, when it received the FIT Contract, the relevant authorities \"all had extensive regulatory and scientific expertise with respect to in-lake developments.\"228 The Respondent had committed itself to developing setbacks and noise requirements for offshore wind energy projects which would have led a reasonable developer to expect that the applicable setbacks would be determined based on a project-specific assessment as part of the Offshore Wind Facility Report that project proponents were required to prepare.229 The REA Regulation and the APRD provided the provincial requirements for offshore wind energy projects, thereby providing the Claimant with reasonable regulatory certainty regarding the assessment process for offshore wind energy.230 The Claimant also alleges that large-scale offshore developments in the Great Lakes are common and regulators in Ontario have decades of experience in regulating water development as well as extensive knowledge of the Great Lakes ecosystem.231\n\n**Memorial,** para. 435.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 428 (citing **CER-Powell,** para. 100). *See also* Hearing Transcript (17 February 2016), 19:9 to 20:19.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 428 (citing **CER-Powell,** para. 95).\n\n**Memorial,** para. 428 (citing **CER-Powell,** para. 95).\n\n165.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, MOE officials repeatedly noted that the REA Regulation provided a rigorous approval process for offshore wind development.232 This ensured that there were protections in place to address any potential concerns.233 The MOE gave no indication that existing regulatory mechanisms were insufficient.234\n\n**Reply,** para. 268 (citing Information Note: **Green Energy Act** and Renewable Energy Approvals of 3 February 2010 **(C-797),** p. 6;

When the FIT Program was adopted, there was broad coordination across the Ontario Government to \"streamline\" approvals and to ensure that project proponents received the necessary approvals as expeditiously as possible.235\n\n**Reply,** para. 80.\n\n167.\n\nWhile the Claimant concedes that the Respondent provided no \"guarantee\" that the proj ect would be built, it submits that \"the Government committed to doing its part\" to ensure that developers would meet the timelines under their respective FIT Contracts.236 Such commitment was in line with the main purpose of the FIT Program and the GEGEA, namely to get energy projects permitted and built as efficiently and expeditiously as possible.237 The Claimant points out that, as part of this commitment, the Government implemented a \"six-month service guarantee for the issuance of the Renewable Energy Approvals.\"238\n\n**Reply,** para. 79.\n\n**Reply,** para. 79.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 117 (citing Article (Ministry of Energy), Ontario Makes it Easier, Faster to Grow Green Energy of 24 September 2009 **(C-137));

The Claimant requests that an adverse inference be drawn that the deleted documents would have further established that the Premier\u2019s Office directed the adoption of the moratorium, and that it was motivated by concerns over costs and public opposition.258\n\n**Memorial,** paras. 335-338;

Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 29:6 to 31:11.\n\n174.\n\nThe Claimant takes issue with the reliability of Mr John Wilkinson\u2019s testimony that the moratorium was decided by him, as the then Minister of Environment, and not the Premier\u2019s Office.259 The Claimant notes that the main individual working on renewable energy policy within the MOE, Ms Marcia Wallace, testified that she had not been aware of the decision to defer offshore wind at the time that Mr Wilkinson alleges to have made the decision.260\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 35:15 to 36:4.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 34:3 to 35:23.\n\n175.\n\nAs to costs, the Claimant explains that the price for offshore wind power, including for the WWIS project, was CAD 190 per MW hour, and therefore significantly higher than the price of CAD 135 per MW hour to be paid for onshore wind power.261\n\n**Memorial,** para. 330.\n\n176.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant contends that in 2010 and 2011 groups opposing wind energy were becoming increasingly active in Ontario.262 The Premier was frequently greeted by anti-wind protestors while on the campaign trail, and anti-wind groups had organized mail-in campaigns to facilitate complaints to elected officials about wind power and had begun to target the electoral ridings of various liberal members of the Provincial Parliament.263 When anti-wind opponents had mounted especially strong campaigns against offshore projects, the governing Liberal Party became sensitive to the offshore wind power issue and its perceived impact on the upcoming election.264\n\n**Memorial,** para. 335.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 335 (citing Article, Talaga, Tanya (Toronto Star), Ontario Scraps Offshore Wind Power Plans of 12 February 2011 **(C-498);

and\n\nd. that the OPA would enter into discussions with the Claimant that would include, among other things, constraining the OPA\u2019s right to terminate the FIT Contract if the Project was delayed by more than two years.295\n\n**Memorial,** para. 623.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 623.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 12.\n\n186.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the last issue was of particular importance because the FIT Contract terms allowed the OPA to terminate the Contract if the Project was delayed for more than two years from its MCOD.296 However, despite these commitments, the OPA rejected the Claimant\u2019s proposals to amend the FIT Contract to ensure that it would not be subject to termination while the moratorium remained in effect.297\n\n**Memorial,** para. 13.\n\n**Reply,** para. 372.\n\n187.\n\nIn particular, the Claimant points out that in its first proposal it requested that it be permitted to elect when to resume the Project \"given that it remains unclear at this stage when a commercially reasonable environmental approvals and Crown land site release process for fresh water off-shore wind will be completed, or what those processes will entail.\"298 It also requested the return of its completion and performance security for the duration of the event of force majeure.299 In its second proposal, the Claimant stated that it was prepared to accept the five-year extension proposed by the Respondent, \"provided that the force majeure could be further extended if the force majeure conditions were not resolved on time for the Project to achieve commercial operation before it risked triggering the termination provisions.\"300\n\n**Reply,** para. 376;

The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) The level of uncertainty regarding the regulatory framework**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant was aware of the lack of necessary regulatory details at the time it made the decision to invest. The Government of Ontario had yet to finalize the guidance material for offshore wind and had no significant experience in regulating large-scale offshore wind projects.315 The Respondent maintains that the Project would have been \"first of a kind\" as no offshore wind project in Ontario had ever gone through an REA process or federal environmental assessment.316 In addition, not only would the Claimant\u2019s Project have been the first offshore wind project in North America, it would have been only the second freshwater offshore wind project anywhere in the world.317 As to the Claimant\u2019s assertion that the Project is not \"first of a kind\" because it comprises pre-existing components, the Respondent\u2019s expert testified that these components have never before been merged together in an approvals process for offshore wind.318\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para.

Second, it asked the MEI to instruct the OPA to provide the Claimant with additional time to complete the Project. Finally, the Claimant asked the MOE to confirm that the five-kilometer setback would not apply to the areas relevant to the Project.337 The Respondent further refers to an exchange that took place on 10 August 2010 between the Claimant and the OPA, in which the Claimant reiterated its concern with respect to the unresolved regulatory uncertainty.338\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 144.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 143; WEI Briefing Document of 24 June 2010 **(C-294),** p. 2.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 148; Email from Ungerman, Paul (MEI) to Benedetti, Chris (Sussex Strategy) of 10 August 2010 **(C-340),** p. 1.\n\n201.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Government did not provide any assurances to the Claimant in the months preceding the execution of the Contract.339 In particular, contrary to the contention of one of the Claimant\u2019s witnesses,340 MNR officials made no commitment with respect to facilitating access to Crown land.341 Indeed, according to the Respondent, the relevant MNR officials \"rebuffed the Claimant\u2019s attempts to extract assurances in relation to its applications for access to Crown land for the Project.\"342\n\n**Rejoinder,** paras. 170-174.\n\n**CWS-Baines,** para. 16.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 173 (citing **RWS-Dumais-1,** para. 21; **RWS-Lawrence-1,** paras. 29-32; **RWS-Lawrence-2,** para. 4).\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 174; **CWS-Baines-2,** para. 33.\n\n202.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant assumed significant risks when it signed the FIT Contract on 20 August 2010 while the MOE was still receiving feedback from the public and conducting its own research.343 More specifically, the Respondent contends that, by signing the Contract, the Claimant accepted all the rights and obligations stipulated in the FIT Contract.344 Shortly after signing the FIT Contract, MNR officials reminded the Claimant that \"there was no policy or procedure in place for offshore development.\"345 The Respondent refutes the suggestion by the Claimant that offshore wind projects are no different than onshore wind projects, referring to the evidence and testimony of its experts that described the differences in costs and construction.346\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 16.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 222.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 226; Meeting Minutes (MNR), Wolfe Island Shoals MNR Kick Off Meeting of 9 September 2010 **(C-357),** p. 2; **RWS-Lawrence,** paras. 41-42.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 149:4 to 151:13.\n\n203.\n\nThe MNR also informed the Claimant that it was free to apply for permits to commence field studies, such as surveying or sampling, while the public consultations on offshore wind continued and the site release process was on hold. However, the Respondent insists that officials made it clear that the Claimant would proceed with any such studies at its own risk, given that the policy consultations were ongoing.347\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 226.\n\n204.\n\nThe Respondent further points out that the Claimant gambled that the MOE would adopt only a five-kilometer setback as a means of addressing all of the concerns raised by the public and the research.348 Given that 85% of the Crown land that the Claimant had applied for was located within the proposed five-kilometer setback, the Claimant also gambled that it would be allowed to swap its existing Crown land applications for Crown land located outside the proposed five-kilometer setback.349 Finally, in signing its FIT Contract, the Claimant accepted the OPA\u2019s termination rights and gambled that it would be able to bring its project into commercial operation within five years, despite being well aware that the regulatory process for its permits and approvals was still under development.350\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 17.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 17.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 17.\n\n205.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s reliance on \"general statements by ministers\" was unreasonable.351 Specifically, the Respondent submits that Minister Cansfield\u2019s statement referred to by the Claimant, according to which Ontario \"was open for business\" was made in 2008, prior to the development of the FIT Program.352 Similarly, the Respondent points out that Minister Smitherman\u2019s representation that the GEGEA \"provided certainty\"353 was made prior to the GEGEA coming into force.354 According to the Respondent, this statement \"could not accurately reflect Ontario\u2019s efforts to operationalize the streamlined approvals process for renewable energy projects\" and \"could not have created a reasonable or objective expectation that the regulatory framework was or would be fully developed for offshore wind projects\" at the time of the execution of the FIT Contract.355\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 152.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 153.\n\n**Reply,** para. 524.\n\n**Rejoinder,** paras. 154-155.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 155.\n\n**(b) The reasons for the moratorium**\n--------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s assertions regarding the motivation underlying the deferral are not supported by the evidence.356 In particular, the Respondent submits that there is no evidence in the record to support the Claimant\u2019s allegation that the decision to defer offshore wind development was made because of electoral politics.357 The Respondent points out that Mr Wilkinson, the Minister of the Environment at the time, has confirmed that his decision had nothing to do with politics.358 The Respondent denies the Claimant\u2019s inference that the Premier\u2019s Office directed the deferral decision because of political motivations, noting that \"the MOE had been concerned for at least six months prior [to the decision] about the lack of standards and the lack of science to justify the new standards.\"359 According to the Respondent, \"the decision to defer offshore development was taken by the Minister of the Environment upon being informed that the regulatory framework to approve projects was unfinished,\"360 as confirmed by the testimony of Mr Wilkinson.361 The Respondent emphasizes that the MOE based the deferral decision on public consultation spanning various considerations such as \"the protection of human health and the environment,\" \"ecological considerations,\" \"cultural resources,\" \"shipwrecks,\" \"shipping lanes,\" \"recreational use,\" \"drinking water\" and \"beach erosion.\"362\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** paras. 390-391.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 391.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 391 (citing **RWS-Wilkinson,** paras. 21-22).\n\nHearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 185:24 to 186:7.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 158:3-12.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 162:16 to 163:1.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 160:17 to 162:15.\n\n207.\n\nAs such, the Respondent argues, the decision to defer offshore wind projects was grounded in the precautionary principle, which suggests waiting until sufficient research had been conducted, so that an adequately informed policy framework could be developed.363 While the Respondent concedes that data existed for onshore wind facilities, it submits that the MOE lacked the information required to understand the impact that the construction and operation of an offshore wind facility would have on the environment.364 Research was required to address numerous concerns, including noise emissions, water quality, disturbance on benthic life forms, and the potential of structural failure.365\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 397;

The Respondent explains that the internal MEI and MNR email relied upon by the Claimant should be construed as offering \"a relevant consideration by MEI\" rather than \"MOE\u2019s and MNR\u2019s justification for undertaking the studies.\"381\n\n**Reply,** para. 413.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 113.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 113.\n\n**(c) The Respondent\u2019s conduct after the imposition of the moratorium**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, while the OPA put forward a number of reasonable solutions to accommodate the Claimant in the context of the deferral, the Claimant chose to reject those offers and make unreasonable and unrealistic demands instead.382 In particular, the Respondent points out that the Claimant not only sought an extension of its MCOD until such date as the Claimant elected to resume the project as well as the return of the full amount of the security deposit, a removal of the time limitations on force majeure, and removal of the OPA\u2019s termination right; it also made requests unrelated to mitigating the impact of the deferral, such as the removal of its domestic content requirement.383\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 455.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 448; **RWS-Cecchini,** para. 21.\n\n214.\n\nThe Respondent states that OPA was willing to allow flexibility regarding the security provided, the specific force majeure status, and the termination rights of both Parties, and that the Claimant was offered a five-year extension of the MCOD.384 However, the Claimant failed to accept the OPA\u2019s offer and made demands that could not have been entertained by OPA.385 In this regard, Mr Perry Cecchini testified that the Claimant\u2019s demand was equivalent to asking for perpetual force majeure, which would have been \"irresponsible\" for the OPA to allow when there needed tobe an end date.386 The Respondent also alleges that none of the Claimant\u2019s proposed alternative projects were acceptable since they were inconsistent with the FIT Rules and would result in major implications to ratepayers and other renewable energy projects already under development.387\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 488.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 489; **RWS-Cecchini,** para. 22.\n\nHearing Transcript (17 February 2016), 239:12 to 240:9.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 451.\n\n215.\n\nThe Respondent states that the negotiations show that the Claimant wanted to dump the existing deal under the FIT Contract and execute a new, better deal on its own terms and timeline.388 The Respondent therefore concludes that \"the fact that the Claimant\u2019s project will not be able to proceed to permitting is because the Claimant declined the opportunity to have its contract frozen.\"389\n\nHearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 205:11-13.\n\nHearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 212:10-13.\n\n**(d) The current status of the Project**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondent states that the current legal status of the contract is that it is in force majeure.390\n\nHearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 203:19-21.\n\n217.\n\nThe Respondent points out that when it decided to defer all offshore wind proj ects, it canceled all Crown land applications for offshore wind sites, with the exception of the Claimant\u2019s. Given the Claimant\u2019s unique position as the only FIT Contract holder for offshore wind, its Contract was frozen until the regulatory framework could be finalized.391 The Respondent attributes this arrangement to the fact that the \"OPA was willing to preserve [the Claimant\u2019s] opportunity to pursue a contract\" and \"didn\u2019t want the Claimant\u2019s [P]roject to fail because... of government\u2019s lack of readiness to approve it.\"392 According to the Respondent, the deferral is intended to last only as long as necessary to conduct scientific research and develop and implement an adequately informed framework for offshore wind projects in Ontario.393 When the decision to implement the deferral was made, this task was expected to take approximately 3-5 years.394\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** paras. 21, 260 (referring to **RWS-Lo,** para. 37).\n\nHearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 202:8-24.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 483.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 483.\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the Claimant has been repeatedly informed that its Project is only put on hold until the regulatory rules and requirements for offshore wind projects are developed.395 According to the Respondent, the Project is therefore merely \"frozen\" and still \"kept alive.\"396 That is, it has not been terminated by the OPA.397 In addition, the Respondent points out that \"the legal status of other assets of the project... remain unaffected.\"398\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** paras. 260, 263-276, 353, 487.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 487; Transcription of Audio Recording of Telephone Conference Call of 11 February 2011 **(C-484);** Hearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 252:21-23.\n\nHearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 252:22-23.\n\nHearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 203:22-25.\n\n**IV.

The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, to the extent that the Claimant is challenging measures adopted or maintained by the OPA, it has the burden of establishing the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to consider the measures.410 The Respondent relies on *Apotex v. United States,* in which the tribunal held that \"Apotex (as claimant) bears the burden of proof with respect to the factual elements necessary to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\"411\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 304.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 304 (referring to *Apotex Inc. v.

The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n228.\n\nWhile the Claimant agrees that the OPA qualifies as a State enterprise for the purpose of NAFTA,429 it takes issue with the Respondent\u2019s assertion that the OPA is an \"independent\"430 entity.431 According to the Claimant, the Respondent has failed to counter the Claimant\u2019s evidence which demonstrates that the MEI had both formal and informal control of the OPA.432 More specifically, the Respondent has not replied to Mr Smitherman\u2019s explanation that he exercised a high degree of control over the OPA during his tenure.433\n\n**Memorial,** paras. 505, 512, 514, 536-541.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** paras. 34, 39, 41, 308, 309.\n\n**Reply,** para. 627.\n\n**Memorial,** paras. 515-535; **Reply,** para. 627.\n\n**Reply,** para. 627; **CWS-Smitherman,** paras. 69-72.\n\n229.\n\nIn addition, according to the Claimant, the MEI \"was heavily engaged with the OPA with respect to post-moratorium negotiations with [the Claimant].\"434 The Claimant relies in particular on the fact that the OPA\u2019s first proposal to the Claimant was made at the direction of the MEI,435 while its second proposal was included in the MEI agenda for its weekly meetings436 The MEI had also discussed with the OPA the possibility of allowing the Contract to \"lapse\" prior to the imposition of the moratorium.437 Moreover, according to the Claimant, \"the OPA had earlier felt compelled to fulfil the promise of the Premier\u2019s Office and MEI to TransCanada to keep TransCanada \u2018whole.\u2019\"438 The MEI had also intervened with the OPA to obtain a one-year extension for the FIT Contract, over the OPA\u2019s protests, and with the support of the [REDACTED].439\n\n**Reply,** para. 628.\n\n**Reply,** para. 628; Chart (MOE), OPA Proposed Response to Windstream of 18 March 2011 (C-1004).\n\n**Reply,** para. 628; Email from Zaveri, Mirrun (MEI) to Viswanathan, Samira (MEI) and Heneberry, Jennifer (MEI) of 6 July 2011 **(C-1026).**\n\n**Reply,** para. 628; Handwritten Notes of Heneberry, Jennifer (MEI) of 25 January 2011 (C-945); Email from Ing, Pearl (MEI) to Viswanathan, Samira (MEI) et al. of 3 February 2011 (C-964); Email from Viswanathan, Samira (MEI) to Heneberry, Jennifer (MEI) of 26 January 2011 (C-950); Handwritten Notes of Heneberry, Jennifer (MEI) of 13 January 2011 (C-920), p. 4; Email from Lo, Sue (MEI) to Ing, Pearl (MEI) et al. of 7 December 2010(C-879).\n\n**Memorial,** paras. 525-533; **Reply,** para. 630.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 535; **Reply,** paras. 130, 631.\n\n230.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees for two reasons with the Respondent\u2019s position that the OPA was not exercising delegated authority \"in failing to implement MEI\u2019s commitment to \u2018freeze\u2019 the FIT Contract or its decision to keep [the Claimant] \u2018whole.\u2019\"440 First, according to the Claimant, the Chief of Staff of the MEI advised the Claimant that the OPA would ensure that the commitment would be met441 Second, in assessing whether a State enterprise is operating in the exercise of governmental authority, one needs to consider the purposes for which the relevant powers are to be exercised and the extent to which the State enterprise is accountable to the Government442 Accordingly, if the Tribunal were to find that the MEI did not retain for itself the responsibility of keeping the FIT Contract \"frozen,\" then that responsibility would be \"squarely directed to the fulfillment of a governmental objective delegated to the OPA.\"443\n\n**Reply,** para. 633 (referring to **Counter-Memorial,** paras. 310-316).\n\n**Reply,** para. 634.\n\n**Reply,** para. 635; Crawford, James, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries* (2002) **(RL-29),** Article 5, p. 101.\n\n**Reply,** para. 636.\n\n231.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that the OPA\u2019s administration of the FIT Program constitutes \"sovereign acts to carry out [the Respondent\u2019s] objective of increasing procurement of electricity from renewable energy sources,\"444 and that the FIT Contract which \"[the Respondent] tasked the OPA with administering, was the key component of [the Respondent\u2019s] signature policy objective of procuring more electricity from renewable energy sources.\"445 According to the Claimant, the Respondent\u2019s argument \"ignores the public purpose behind the OPA\u2019s involvement in the FIT Program, which simply cannot be characterized as merely commercial in nature.\"446\n\n**Reply,** para. 638.\n\n**Reply,** para. 639.\n\n**Reply,** para. 639.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe disagreement between the Parties concerns the interpretation and application of Article 1503(2) of NAFTA. (\"State Enterprises\"), which provides:\n\n\"2. Each Party shall ensure, through regulatory control, administrative supervision or the application of other measures, that any state enterprise that it maintains or establishes acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party\u2019s obligations under Chapters Eleven (Investment) and Fourteen (Financial Services) wherever such enterprise exercises any regulatory, administrative or other governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it, such as the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial transactions or impose quotas, fees or other charges.\"\n\n233.\n\nArticle 1503(2) of NAFTA, makes it clear that the State parties to NAFTA are responsible for the conduct of State enterprises, but only to the extent that such enterprises are empowered to exercise governmental authority. This is consistent with Article 5 of the ILC Articles, which further specifies that \"[t]he conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State... but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.\" In other words, the conduct of persons or entities such as State enterprises which are not formal organs of the State can only be attributable to the State if the person or entity in question is exercising governmental authority in the particular instance.\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that under the Electricity Act of 1998, while the OPA was \"not an agent of the Crown,\" the Government of Ontario (the MEI) had the authority to issue directions to OPA447 Consequently, to the extent that OPA acted on the basis of such directions, its conduct could be considered attributable to Canada, depending on whether the direction in question involved a delegation of exercise of governmental authority to the OPA. Thus, the determination of whether any of the specific acts or omissions of the OPA at issue in this case are indeed attributable to Canada requires an assessment of the relevant directions and therefore cannot be made *in abstracto,* but only *in concreto,* in the context of an assessment of the relevant direction. Any such determination is necessarily closely intertwined with the merits and therefore cannot be decided independently of the merits.

This deadline can only be extended by up to two years (i.e., to 4 May 2017) by reason of force majeure. Thereafter, either party will be entitled to terminate the FIT Contract.464 While the Claimant\u2019s Project currently has force majeure status, the Claimant argues that there is no longer any realistic prospect that the Project will reach commercial operation by 4 May 2017. The Claimant notes that this was admitted by Mr Cecchini of the OPA during his testimony465 According to the Claimant, the deadline became unachievable as of 4 May 2012,466 \"[i]n light of the period that would be required to re-start the Project, confirm regulatory requirements, obtain the required approvals, complete development work and build the Project.\"467 The Claimant argues that, consequently, the Project is no longer \"financeable.\"468 The Claimant adds that, even if the OPA were to waive its right to terminate the FIT Contract, the Government\u2019s actions have created such a level of uncertainty around the offshore wind industry that none of the potential partners with whom Windstream was negotiating would now invest in the Project.469\n\n**Memorial,** para. 556.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 23:4-24.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 557; **Reply,** para. 408; Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 22:20-25.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 318.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 558; **Reply,** paras. 6, 407; Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 22:25.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 561.\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, as a direct consequence of the moratorium and the Respondent\u2019s failure to effectively \"freeze\" the Project as promised,470 its investments in the Project and the FIT Contract are now substantially worthless,471 and this amounts to an indirect expropriation.472 The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent\u2019s assertion that \"the fact that Windstream\u2019s investments are now worthless is somehow Windstream\u2019s fault.\"473 The OPA rejected Windstream\u2019s request that the FIT Contract remain under force majeure for the duration of the moratorium and instead proposed to limit any extension to five years, while retaining the security, regardless of the fact that the Ontario Government had not specified the duration of the moratorium.474 The Claimant did not accept the OPA\u2019s offer because it was \"unreasonable.\"475\n\n**Memorial,** para. 563; **Reply,** paras. 367-371.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 560; **Reply,** paras. 407-408, 532.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 565; **Reply,** paras. 532-533.\n\n**Reply,** para. 478 (referring to **Counter-Memorial,** para. 489).\n\n**Reply,** para. 479.\n\n**Reply,** para. 479.\n\n240.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the situation in the present arbitration is \"analogous\" to that underlying the *Khan Resources v.

The Kyrgyz Republic,* in which the tribunal concluded that a \"temporary\" measure suspending the powers of the board and managing bodies of five Kyrgyz banks was expropriatory479 and emphasizes that the decision in *Tecmed,* on which the Respondent relies, \"confirms that a temporary measure may lead to a permanent deprivation.\"480 The Claimant points out that \"[t]here is no indication on the record that the Ontario Government truly intends to lift the moratorium in the near future, or at all.\"481\n\n**Reply,** para. 481 (referring to **Counter-Memorial,** paras. 482-483); Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 24:5-9.\n\n**Reply,** para. 482 (referring to *Valeri Belokon v.

If this raison d\u2019\u00eatre is plainly absent, the measure of expropriation is \u2018arbitrary\u2019 and therefore involves the international responsibility of the state.\"485\n\n**Memorial,** para. 568; **Reply,** paras. 489-505.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 567.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that \"Ontario has realized an economic benefit of between [CAD] 1.3 billion to [CAD] 2.5 billion by imposing the moratorium and indirectly cancelling the Project.\"486 According to the Claimant, Ontario wanted to prevent the Project from proceeding \"so that the OPA would not be required to procure power from WWIS at the higher offshore energy prices.\"487 The Claimant refers to a statement by the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, Mr Brad Duguid, made shortly after the imposition of the moratorium, asking \" [i] f we\u2019re reaching our clean energy objectives with onshore projects in solar, wind, bioenergy, why would we then want to expand into offshore which is going to be more costly?\"488\n\n**Memorial,** para. 569 (referring to **CER-Advisory); Reply,** para. 303.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 334; **Reply,** paras. 302-303.\n\n**Memorial,** paras. 10, 331 (referring to Article, Spears, John, Ontario Denies Losing Its Taste for Renewable Energy of 17 February 2011 **(C-504)).**\n\n245.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the expropriation was also discriminatory. The moratorium discriminated against Windstream, as a FIT Contract holder, by preventing it from proceeding through the REA process in order to bring its Project into operation by the deadline in its FIT Contract. According to the Claimant, such a constraint was not imposed on other FIT Contract holders.489\n\n**Memorial,** para. 570.\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that the expropriation was not carried out in accordance with due process requirements. In the Claimant\u2019s view, the imposition of the moratorium \"overrides the provisions of the REA Regulation and of Wind Policy 4.10.04\" that have been adopted \"to encourage Windstream and other developers to invest in renewable energy projects in Ontario.\"490 The Claimant contends that \"[t]his regulatory framework applies equally to offshore wind projects as it does to onshore ones, yet has been eviscerated with respect to offshore wind projects.\"491\n\n**Memorial,** para. 574.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 574.\n\n247.\n\nFinally, the Claimant claims that the Respondent failed to pay any compensation for its expropriatory measures, which also renders it unlawful492\n\n**Memorial,** para. 575.\n\n**(c) The rationale for the moratorium is not relevant for the expropriation analysis**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the rationale for the moratorium is not relevant for the expropriation analysis.\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimant refers to the Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration, in which the Respondent argues that the moratorium cannot have the effect of substantially depriving Windstream of the value of its investment because \"it was a *bona fide,* non-discriminatory governmental decision implemented in the public interest\" and that \"Article 1110 does not prohibit such legitimate governmental decision making.\"493 The Claimant submits that this argument should be rejected for several reasons494\n\n**Amended Response to the Notice of Arbitration,** para. 60 (referred to in **Memorial,** para. 577).\n\n**Memorial,** para. 577.\n\n250.\n\nFirst, the Claimant argues that there is no public policy exception to expropriation and that the Respondent\u2019s argument that regulatory measures having a legitimate public purpose cannot be expropriatory should be rejected.495 The Claimant avers that \"recognition of a broad \u2018public purpose\u2019 exception to expropriation would be inconsistent with the plain wording of Article 1110,\" as \"Article 1110(1)(a) provides that a public purpose is a prerequisite to a finding of expropriation, including indirect expropriation.\"496\n\n**Memorial,** para. 578; **Reply,** paras. 501-503.\n\n**Reply,** para. 489 (emphasis in original).\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that the Respondent\u2019s position is based on an incorrect interpretation of the **Methanex** decision, pointing out that, while the **Methanex** tribunal broadened the scope of the \"police powers\" doctrine, thus making certain types of general regulatory measures non-compensable, the tribunal in that case found that the challenged measures did not substantially deprive the investor of the value of its investment.497 The Claimant further asserts that many tribunals have rejected the application of a broad \"public purpose\" exception, including the NAFTA tribunals in *Pope & Talbot, Metalclad* and *Feldman,*498 as well as the tribunals in *Santa Elena v. Costa Rica,499 Azurix500* and *Vivendi II.501* In particular, the Claimant states that the tribunal in *Vivendi II* observed that \"the application of a public policy exception to expropriation is inconsistent with the plain language of Article 1110 (and many expropriation provisions in BITs)\" and held that \"Article 1110 provides that a failure to compensate an investor for the expropriation of its investment is a breach, even if the expropriation is for a public purpose.\"502\n\n**Memorial,** para. 579 (referring to *Methanex Corporation v.

The Claimant alleges that the moratorium was motivated by concerns about the cost of offshore power and public opposition to wind turbine projects, particularly in certain key electoral ridings for the governing Liberal Party, rather than \"scientific uncertainty\" concerning offshore wind development.507\n\n**Memorial,** para. 583; **Reply,** paras. 507-512.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 583.\n\n254.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the \"scientific uncertainty\" rationale put forward by the Respondent is undermined by many elements, including that: (i) it was a rationale arrived at by politicians (rather than scientific personnel) only after a number of other rationales for constraining offshore wind were considered and rejected; (ii) several key government officials expressed skepticism about the legitimacy of scientific uncertainty as a rationale for imposing a moratorium on offshore wind; (iii) it was inconsistent with Minister Cansfield\u2019s statement of 21 October 2009 that the government\u2019s \"research made it clear that developing offshore wind potential would be practical and environmentally sound once the appropriate infrastructure is in place;\" and (iv) Ontario has made no serious efforts to advance scientific research following the moratorium.508 The Claimant emphasizes that the Respondent \"has not provided any credible evidence of harm to the environment.\"509 As to the alleged concern about drinking water, the Claimant asserts that it has been accepted that there is no problem with drinking water, not to mention there is no credible evidence of a significant threat to drinking water.510\n\n**Memorial,** para. 583; **Reply,** para. 511.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 38:20-21.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 39:10 to 40:15.\n\n255.\n\nThird, the Claimant contends that the effects of the Respondent\u2019s measures have been disproportionate to their stated public policy rationale.511 According to the Claimant, the Respondent could have resorted to less intrusive measures to achieve its stated public policy objective.512\n\n**Memorial,** para. 585; **Reply,** paras. 513-521; Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 38:15-19.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 585; **Reply,** para. 521.\n\n256.\n\nFourth, the Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s measures were contrary to Ontario\u2019s specific commitments and Windstream\u2019s legitimate expectations, noting that \"tribunals that accept a public policy exception to expropriation do not apply it where the measure is contrary to the state\u2019s specific commitments to the investor or to the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations.\"513 According to the Claimant, the moratorium was a reversal of Ontario\u2019s self-promotion as \"open for business\" for offshore wind and its repeated assurances that it supported the Project.514\n\n**Memorial,** para. 587 (referring to *National Grid pic v.

The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) The FIT Contract is not an interest capable of being expropriated**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there is no expropriation in this case. According to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s argument that the FIT Contract has been rendered \"substantially worthless\" must fail as the FIT Contract does not create an investment capable of being expropriated.515 Since NAFTA contains a closed definition of investment, the Claimant must demonstrate that the FIT Contract is among the exhaustive list of investments found in Article 113 9,516\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 460.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 466.\n\n258.\n\nMoreover, relying on *Emmis v. Hungary,* the Respondent contends that the existence of a valid FIT Contract does not excuse the Claimant from proving that \"specific rights... under the Contract have vested such that they are capable of being expropriated, and that there was an expropriation.\"517 While the Respondent does not dispute the fact that the FIT Contract \"imposes some vested rights and obligations,\"518 it contends that the Claimant has failed to show that such rights have been expropriated.519\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 79 (referring to *Emmis International Holding, B.V, Emmis Radio Operating, B.V., MEM Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi Es Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft v.

Referring to the decision in *Feldman v.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nThe Parties disagree not only on whether an expropriation has taken place, but also on the criteria for such determination. The relevant provision of NAFTA., Article 1110, sets out the criteria for legality of expropriation and defines the modalities of compensation, but does not provide any criteria for determining whether or when an expropriation has taken place. However, the provision does distinguish between direct and indirect expropriation, and as summarized above, it is the Claimant\u2019s case that the Respondent has indirectly expropriated its investment.\n\n284.\n\nNAFTA tribunals have generally taken the view that under Article 1110 of NAFTA the determination of whether an indirect expropriation has taken place is in the first place a matter of evidence, that is, a factual determination of whether an effective or **de facto** taking of property that is attributable to the State has taken place, even if there has been no formal transfer of title, and even if the host State has not obtained any economic benefit. If it is determined that such a **de facto** taking has indeed taken place, the issue arises as to whether the taking is lawful, and what the appropriate form and level of relief should be. In certain circumstances, the question may also arise as to whether the alleged taking is excused by a justification provided under international law, such as the police powers doctrine.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the first step in the process of determining whether an effective taking has taken place is to determine whether the investor has been substantially deprived of the value of its investment.573 This is a test that has been applied by numerous investment treaty tribunals, including NAFTA tribunals. Thus, in *ADMv Mexico,* the tribunal held:\n\n\"The test on which other Tribunals and doctrine have agreed - and on which the Claimants\u2019 [sic] rely - is the \u2018effects test.\u2019 Judicial practice indicates that the severity of the economic impact is the decisive criterion in deciding whether an indirect expropriation or a measure tantamount to expropriation has taken place. An expropriation occurs if the interference is substantial and deprives the investor of all or most of the benefits of the investment. There is a broad consensus in academic writings that the intensity and duration of the economic deprivation is the crucial factor in identifying an indirect expropriation or equivalent measure.\"574\n\nIn making its determination on this and other issues, the Tribunal has reviewed and considered the submissions of the United States and Mexico pursuant to Article 1128 of NAFTA..\n\n*Archer Daniels Midland Company and Tate & Lyle Ingredients Americas, Inc. v. Mexico* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/04/05), Award of 21 November 2007 **(CL-23),** para. 240.\n\n286.\n\nThe *Cargill v Mexico* tribunal similarly stressed that a finding of expropriation requires \"radical deprivation of the Claimant\u2019s economic use and enjoyment of its investment:\"\n\n\"It is widely accepted that a finding of expropriation of property under customary international law requires a radical deprivation of a claimant\u2019s economic use and enjoyment of its investment. This is the consistent view of previous NAFTA tribunals.\n\n*\u2018[T]he affected property* must be impaired to such an extent that it must be seen as \u2018taken.\" \u2018The taking must be a substantially complete deprivation of the economic use and enjoyment of the rights to the property, or of identifiable distinct parts thereof (i.e., it approaches total impairment).\u2019 It is a view also stated in numerous BIT arbitrations. Therefore, putting to the side the question of sufficiency of the duration of the interference, the Tribunal must find a radical deprivation of the Claimant\u2019s economic use and enjoyment of its investment for the period of the interference.\"575\n\n*Cargill Incorporated v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/05/2), Award of 18 September 2009 **(CL-31),** para. 360 (footnotes omitted).\n\n287.\n\nIn *Metalclad v Mexico* the tribunal analyzed the distinction made in Article 1110 of NAFTA. between direct and indirect expropriation, noting that both require \"the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property:\"\n\n\"Thus, expropriation under NAFTA includes not only open, deliberate and acknowledged takings of property, such as outright seizure or formal or obligatory transfer of title in favour of the host State, but also covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property even if not necessarily to the obvious benefit of the host State.\"576\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/1), Award of 30 August 2001 **(CL-62),** para. 103.\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimant claims that such a *de facto* taking of its investment has occurred in the present case. According to the Claimant, under the FIT Contract, WWIS had the obligation to bring the Project into commercial operation by 4 May 2015. This deadline could be extended, but only up to two years, i.e., until 4 May 2017, for reason of force majeure, whereafter either party will be entitled to terminate the Contract. The Claimant contends that, while the Project is currently under force majeure, there is no longer any realistic prospect that the Project can reach commercial operation by 4 May 2017. Consequently, the Project is no longer financeable and has effectively lost all of its value. This is the case even if the OPA were to waive its right to terminate the FIT Contract as the conduct of the Ontario Government has created such uncertainty around the offshore wind industry in Ontario that no potential investor would be prepared to invest in the Project.\n\n289.\n\nAs summarized above, the Respondent argues that, on the facts, there has been no expropriation in this case because the Project had no value at the time of its alleged taking. At most, the Claimant was deprived of an \"opportunity\" to develop the Project. Moreover, the moratorium is only a temporary measure and therefore could not have resulted in a permanent deprivation of the Claimant\u2019s investment. The Claimant\u2019s assets, including the security deposit, remain intact and could be returned if the Claimant entered into a mutual termination agreement with the OPA.\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the relevant evidence and finds that, on the facts, no expropriation has taken place in this case. First, the Claimant\u2019s FIT Contract is still formally in force and has not been unilaterally terminated by the Government of Ontario; consequently, while the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that the Project can no longer be completed by the MCOD, 4 May 2017, it continues to remain open for the Parties to re-activate and, as appropriate, renegotiate the FIT Contract to adjust its terms to the moratorium. Second, and more importantly in the context of the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim, the Claimant\u2019s CAD 6 million security deposit is still in place and has not been taken or rendered otherwise worthless as a result of any action taken by the Government of Ontario. Under Article 10.1(g) of the FIT Contract, if by reason of force majeure the MCOD is delayed for an aggregate of more than 24 months (which is the case here), completion and performance security will be returned at the time of the termination of the agreement by either party. Consequently, the Respondent cannot terminate, and indeed confirmed at the hearing that it would not be able to terminate, the FIT Contract pursuant to Article 10.1(g) without returning the security. It therefore cannot be said that the Claimant has been substantially deprived of its investment.\n\n291.\n\nIn reaching the conclusion that, on the facts, the Claimant has not been substantially deprived of its investment, the Tribunal has taken into account its determination of the overall value of the Claimants\u2019 investment, as set out in Section B below. As determined in Section B, the amount of money invested by the Claimant in the Project - its sunk costs - do not substantially exceed, if at all, the value of the security deposit. Consequently, although the Tribunal accepts (as determined in Section B below) that the Claimant\u2019s investment consists not only of the sunk investment costs and the security deposit, but also of the value created by the Claimant in developing the Project, the value of the asset that is still available to the Claimant as it has not been taken (i.e., the security deposit) is substantial, in particular when compared to the overall value of the investment. In the circumstances, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that the Claimant has been substantially deprived of the value of its investment.\n\n**B. NAFTA Article 1105 - Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent has failed to grant Windstream\u2019s investments fair and equitable treatment in breach of its obligations under Article 1105(1) of NAFTA. According to the Claimant, fair and equitable treatment is one of the elements included in the umbrella concept of minimum standard of treatment.577 The Claimant submits that the minimum standard of treatment is a rule of customary international law and as such constitutes the \"floor\" of treatment protected under Article 1105,578\n\nHearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 103:18-19; Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 45:1-6 (referring to Dumberry, Patrick, *The Fair And Equitable Treatment Standard: A Guide ToNAFTA Case Law On-Article 1105* (2013) **(CL-148),** p. 45).\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 44:8-14 (referring to Dumberry, Patrick, *The Fair And Equitable Treatment Standard: A Guide ToNAFTA Case Law On-Article 1105* (2013) **(CL-148)).**\n\n293.\n\nCiting various arbitral awards, the Claimant explains that examples of treatment that have been deemed to fall below the fair and equitable treatment standard include the breach of commitments or of the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations;579 failure to observe the required regulatory fairness and predictability;580 arbitrariness;581 and discrimination.582 The Claimant notes that, while bad faith is a persuasive indicator of unfair treatment, it is not a necessary element for finding a breach of Article 1105(1).583\n\n**Memorial,** para. 597; **Reply,** paras. 537, 540, 545.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 600; **Reply,** paras. 537, 540.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 601; **Reply,** paras. 537, 540.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 602; **Reply,** para. 540.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 603.\n\n294.\n\nThe Claimant accepts that it has the burden of proving that the legal standard has been breached.584 However, as to proving what the relevant legal standard is, the Claimant submits that there is an equal burden on either side to provide evidence of customary law, i.e., state practice and *opinio juris.585* The Claimant emphasizes that its main position is not that \"there is a customary international law principle under [the fair and equitable treatment standard] of legitimate expectations that is... independent and standalone.\"586 According to the Claimant, legitimate expectations is one of the elements or factors examined by tribunals when determining whether a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard has occurred.587\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 46:6-9.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 46:9-16.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 51:7-10.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 51:1-3, 51:11-19, 56:3-10.\n\n295.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s position that the threshold for proving a breach of Article 1105(1) is \"extremely high\" is incorrect.588 In *Bilcon v. Canada,* the tribunal rejected Canada\u2019s arguments that the challenged conduct needs to rise to the level of shocking or outrageous behavior.589 The Claimant also cites the tribunal in *Mondev v.

**Reply,** para. 571.\n\n**Reply,** para. 572.\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s commitments, representations and assurances included that: (i) Ontario was \"open for business\" for offshore wind; (ii) timely approval of applications to use Crown land for offshore wind energy development could be expected by those submitting applications; (iii) the streamlined regulatory approvals process created by the GEGEA applied equally to all renewable energy projects, including offshore wind projects; (iv) the GEGEA, and the FIT Program and REA process it created, would make Ontario the \"destination of choice for green power developers... including wind, both onshore and offshore\" by providing \"certainty that government would issue permits in a timely way\" and a fair price guaranteed \"for decades,\" and that the Act would \"coordinate approvals from the [MOE and MNR] into a streamlined process with a service guarantee;\" (v) Ontario was satisfied that its research \"made clear\" that developing offshore wind was environmentally sound, and as a result lifted the earlier deferral on accepting applications for offshore wind project development; (vi) the Project had the \"highest priority\" for receiving AOR status and would receive \"priority attention from MNR;\" (vii) the Ontario Government, including the Premier\u2019s Office, supported the Project; (viii) the Government was working \"feverishly\" to develop offshore REA guidelines and that, as of May 2010, the guidelines would be available \"very soon;\" (ix) the MNR \"appreciate[d] Windstream\u2019s need for certainty\" before it signed a FIT Contract, and would \"move as quickly as possible through the remainder of the application review process in order that [WWIS] may obtain Applicant of Record status in atimely manner;\" (x)the approval process forthe Projectwould be expedited; and (xi)the Project could proceed as an offshore wind pilot project.597 The Claimant emphasizes that \"[w]ithout this repeated and continuous confirmation of the government\u2019s support for the Project, Windstream would not have invested time and capital in the Project.\"598\n\n**Memorial,** para. 606. *See also* **Reply,** paras. 557-559.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 607. *See also* **Reply,** para. 561.\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimant points out that Minister Smitherman stated in his witness statement that remarks he had made on the occasion of the introduction of the GEGEA \"were designed to attract investors to Ontario.\"599 Windstream relied on these commitments when it decided to invest in WWIS and the Project.600 In the view of the Claimant, \"[t]hese representations are akin to the representations given to the claimant in *Bilcon,* on which the tribunal in that case relied in finding that Canada had breached Article 1105(1).\"601\n\n**Reply,** para. 559 (citing **CWS-Smitherman,** para. 21 (emphasis removed)).\n\n**Reply,** para. 561 (referring to **CWS-Mars-2,** paras. 11-22;

**Reply,** paras. 596, 599.\n\n306.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent failed to fulfill its promises to ensure that the moratorium would not penalize Windstream.621 The Claimant contends that the Respondent could have treated Windstream \"fairly\" by ensuring the Project was \"frozen\" and not \"cancelled\" or by giving it an alternative project, like it did for TransCanada.622\n\n**Memorial,** para. 623;

The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant\u2019s allegations \"that Ontario\u2019s adoption and implementation of the deferral violated Canada\u2019s obligation to provide the Claimant with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment because it (1) was arbitrary and grossly unfair; (2) constituted a repudiation of the regulatory framework; (3) violated the commitments and representations made by Ontario contrary to the Claimant\u2019s legitimate expectations; and (4) was discriminatory\" are without any merit.631 The Respondent argues that Article 1105(1) of NAFTA. only requires Canada to accord the customary international minimum standard of treatment of aliens, referring to NAFTA\u2019s Free Trade Commission\u2019s (\"FTC\") Notes of Interpretation of 31 July 2001,632\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 361.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** paras. 366, 369.\n\n311.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal must \"consider the applicable customary rules, which requires proof of extensive uniform, consistent, and general practice by States, together with the States\u2019 belief that such practice is required by law.\"633 The Respondent notes that \"the practice of states does not support the proposition that standalone FET clauses have become part of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment\" and \"there is no uniform consistent practice.\"634 According to the Respondent, \"to prove a breach of Article 1105 requires proving a breach of a customary international law standard, such as denial of justice or a breach of an investor\u2019s full protection and security.\"635 The Respondent submits that \"the Claimant has not met its burden in identifying a standard of customary international law and has not alleged a denial of justice or a breach of full protection and security.\"636\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 156:21-25.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 155:7-11, 16-17.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 157:6-10.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 157:13-21.\n\n312.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the threshold to establish a breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA is very high.637 In particular, following the FTC Note of Interpretation, NAFTA tribunals \"have consistently affirmed that a violation of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law will not be found unless there is evidence of egregious conduct, such as serious malfeasance, manifestly arbitrary behaviour or denial of justice.\"638\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 382.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 382.\n\n313.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the tribunal in *S.D.

Arbitral decisions interpreting \u2018autonomous\u2019 fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security provisions in other treaties... do not constitute evidence of the content of the customary international law standard required by Article 1105....\n\nStates may modify or amend their regulation to achieve legitimate public welfare objectives and will not incur liability under customary international law merely because such changes interfere with an investor\u2019s \u2018expectations\u2019 about the state of regulation in a particular sector.\n\nThe burden is on a claimant to establish the existence and applicability of a relevant obligation under customary international law that meets the requirements of State practice and *opinio juris.* \u2018The party which relies on a custom,\u2019 therefore, \u2018must prove that this custom is established in such a manner that it has become binding on the other Party. \u2019 Once a rule of customary international law has been established, the claimant must show that the State has engaged in conduct that violates that rule.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n**(a) The interpretation and content of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent has breached Article 1105(1) (\"Minimum Standard of Treatment\") of NAFTA. Article 1105(1) provides:\n\n\"1. Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\"\n\n348.\n\nWhile the Parties disagree on the content of the minimum standard of treatment set out in Article 1105(1), as well as on how the content of the standard should be established, they agree that the interpretation of this provision by the FTC in its Notes of Interpretation of 31 July 2001 is binding on all NAFTA tribunals under Article 1131(2) (\"Governing Law\") of NAFTA..741 The FTC\u2019s Notes of Interpretation state:\n\n\"1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.\n\n2. The concepts of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 and \u2018full protection and security\u2019 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\n\n3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).\"\n\nArticle 1131(2) of NAFTA provides that \"[a]n interpretation by the Commission of a provision of this agreement shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section.\"\n\n349.\n\nThe Claimant submits that both Parties bear the burden of proving the content of the standard. According to the Claimant, rather than requiring the Parties to prove the existence of custom on the basis of state practice and *opinio juris,* NAFTA tribunals have relied primarily on arbitral jurisprudence in determining the level of conduct that amounts to a breach of the requirement of fair and equitable treatment. The Respondent submits, in response, that it is the Claimant that bears the burden of proving the content of the standard because it is the party alleging that the standard has been breached. In support of its position, the Respondent refers *inter alia* to *Cargill v Mexico,* in which the tribunal held that \"it is for the party asserting the custom to establish the content of that custom.\"\n\n350.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that it is in the first place for the party asserting that a particular rule of customary international law exists to prove the existence of the rule. However, in the present case the issue is not whether the relevant rule of customary international law exists; the minimum standard of treatment contained in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA. is indeed a rule of customary international law, as interpreted by the FTC in its Notes of Interpretation. The issue therefore is not whether the rule exists, but rather how the content of a rule that does exist - the minimum standard of treatment in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA. - should be established. The Tribunal is therefore unable to accept the Respondent\u2019s argument that the burden of proving the content of the rule falls exclusively on the Claimant. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, it is for each Party to support its position as to the content of the rule with appropriate legal authorities and evidence. On this issue, the Respondent argues, and the Claimant appears to agree, that the Tribunal is not strictly bound by the Parties\u2019 positions although it may be said to be bound by the record before it in the sense that, if the Tribunal considers that there are issues or questions that neither Party has fully or properly addressed, or if it wishes to refer to legal authorities other than those cited by the Parties, it should draw the Parties\u2019 attention to those issues, questions and authorities and solicit the Parties\u2019 views thereon. This is indeed what the Tribunal has sought to do in the course of the present proceedings, having put forward a series of questions both before and during the February 2016 hearing, including regarding the content of the minimum standard of treatment.\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal further agrees with the Respondent that in principle the content of a rule of customary international law such as the minimum standard of treatment can best be determined on the basis of evidence of actual State practice establishing custom that also shows that the States have accepted such practice as law *(opinio juris).* However, the Tribunal notes that neither Party has produced such evidence in this arbitration. In the circumstances, the Tribunal must rely on other, indirect evidence in order to ascertain the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment; the Tribunal cannot simply declare *non liquet.* Such indirect evidence includes, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, decisions taken by other NAFTA tribunals that specifically address the issue of interpretation and application of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA, as well as relevant legal scholarship.742\n\nThis approach is consistent with the approach that the International Court of Justice is required to adopt under Article 38 of its Statute, which provides that the Court may refer to \"judicial decisions and the teachings of the most highly qualified publicists of the various nations, as *subsidiary means* for the determination of rules of law\" (emphasis added).\n\n352.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that other NAFTA tribunals have adopted a similar approach when seeking to determine the contents of the minimum standard of treatment in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA.. Both Parties have also extensively cited to NAFTA awards and legal scholarship. Furthermore, while decisions of earlier international tribunals such as the ****Neer**** tribunal are often referred to as reflective of the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, including by the Respondent in the present proceedings, the Tribunal notes that ****Neer**** is also an award (or more accurately, a decision of an international claims commission), not direct evidence of State practice, and that the ****Neer**** tribunal itself did not have any direct evidence relating to State practice before it.743 The Tribunal is therefore unable to determine the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment by revisiting the evidence before the ****Neer**** tribunal. Nor did the *Neer* decision deal with the treatment of foreign investors, and consequently the factual circumstances of the case are in any event not directly relevant here.\n\n*See L. F. H. Neer and Pauline Neer (United States) v. United Mexican States* (Mexico-United States Claims Commission), Decision of 15 October 1926, para. 4 (citing Basset Moore, John, *American Journal of International Law* (1910), p. 787.\n\n353.\n\nThe Parties also disagree on the content of the minimum standard of treatment. According to the Claimant, the minimum standard of treatment is an \"umbrella concept\" which incorporates different elements, the fair and equitable treatment standard being one of these elements. Citing *Pope & Talbot,* the Claimant contends that the FTC Notes do not require that the reference to the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 1105(1) should be ignored; any other reading would require \"including\" to be read as \"excluding.\" Moreover, according to the Claimant, the content of the minimum standard of treatment is not static, but evolves over time with the development of customary international law, as explained by Professor Dolzer in his expert opinion.\n\n354.\n\nThe Respondent argues, in turn, that a breach of the minimum standard of treatment requires \"egregious\" conduct, and while bad faith is not required to commit a breach, it will in practice often be present. According to the Respondent, treaties containing \"autonomous\" fair and equitable treatment standards are not evidence of State practice or *opinio juris,* and the expert opinion of Professor Dolzer must therefore be rejected. Moreover, mere inconsistency with domestic law or breach of contract is not sufficient to breach customary international law, nor are NAFTA tribunals courts of appeal from decisions of domestic courts.\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully analyzed the Parties\u2019 positions and considers that, when determining the content of the standard of treatment contained in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA., it cannot disregard the language of the provision. While the FTC in its Notes of Interpretation established that the rule contained in Article 1105(1) of NAFTA., bearing the heading \"Minimum Standard of Treatment,\" is the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, it does not follow that the terms used in this provision have thereby become irrelevant; there is nothing in the FTC\u2019s Notes which would suggest that NAFTA tribunals should entirely disregard the relevant rules of treaty interpretation. Indeed, there can be no \"plain reading\" of a treaty provision that would involve no interpretation at all; \"plain meaning\" is in itself a result of interpretation. Consequently, when determining the content of the standard of treatment contained in Article 1105(1), the Tribunal must take into account both FTC\u2019s Notes of Interpretation, which establish that the standard contained in Article 1105(1) is indeed the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, and the general rule of treaty interpretation, as reflected in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, which establishes that a treaty must be interpreted \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"\n\n356.\n\nAs to the terms used, Article 1105(1) provides that each State party shall accord to investments of investors of another party \"treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\" Consequently, while keeping in mind that the standard set out in the provision is the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, the Tribunal must also take into account the express language of the provision, which refers to \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security.\" The Tribunal therefore considers that the treatment required under Article 1105 (1) is fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security consistent with the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law. In other words, as stated by the FTC, the treatment required is not \"in addition to or beyond\" that which is required by the customary international law standard, but one that is in accordance, or consistent, with the standard, while remaining \"fair and equitable\" and providing \"full protection and security.\"\n\n357.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimant argues that the Respondent is in breach of the \"fair and equitable\" treatment component of the minimum standard of treatment, but does not allege that the Respondent has failed to provide \"full protection and security.\" The Tribunal does not consider it helpful, for purposes of determining the content of the \"fair and equitable\" treatment component of the standard, to look for dictionary definitions of the terms used in Article 1105(1) - \"fair\" and \"equitable.\" This is not only unhelpful as it would effectively result in replacing these terms with other words which would then also have to be interpreted; but also because it would create the risk that if the alleged breach were to be assessed in light of such other terms rather than the terms actually used in Article 1105(1), the standard to be applied would not be the standard set out in Article 1105(1), but another standard that might not be in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. The State parties to NAFTA must have considered, when using the terms \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security,\" that it is these terms, and not any others, that best reflect the content of the minimum standard of treatment set out in the provision. Nor can the FTC\u2019s Notes of Interpretation be taken to mean that a NAFTA tribunal must entirely disregard the terms \"fair and equitable\" and \"full protection and security\" in Article 1105(1) when considering whether the customary international law standard of treatment set out in the provision has been met.\n\n358.\n\nGiven that the Claimant invokes the \"fair and equitable\" treatment element, but not the \"full protection and security\" element of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA., in support of its Article 1105 claim, the Tribunal must determine whether the Respondent\u2019s conduct that the Claimant alleges as a breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA. may be considered \"unfair\" or \"inequitable\" in accordance with the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. This determination is best done, not in the abstract, but in the context of the facts of this particular case, taking into account the indirect evidence of the content of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment as evidenced in the decisions of other NAFTA tribunals.\n\n359.\n\nAs noted above, this is also how other NAFTA tribunals have approached the issue. The Tribunal agrees in particular with the *Pope & Talbot* tribunal, which stated:\n\n\"The [FTC] Interpretation concluded that Article 1105 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of other Parties. The Interpretation does not require that the concepts of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 and \u2018full protection and security\u2019 be ignored, but rather that they be considered as part of the minimum standard of treatment that it prescribes. Parenthetically, any other construction of the Interpretation where by the fairness elements were treated as having no effect, would be to suggest that the Commission required the word \u2018including\u2019 in Article 1105(1) to be read as \u2018excluding.\u2019 Such an approach has only to be stated to be rejected. Therefore, the Interpretation requires each Party to accord to investments of investors of the other Parties the fairness elements as subsumed in, rather than additive to, customary international law.\"744\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc. v. The Government of Canada* (UNCITRAL), Interim Award of 26 June 2000 **(CL-74),** p. 26.\n\n360.\n\nSimilarly, the *Mondev* tribunal observed:\n\n\"When a tribunal is faced with the claim by a foreign investor that the investment has been unfairly or inequitably treated or not accorded full protection and security, it is bound to pass upon that claim on the facts and by application of any governing treaty provisions. A judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case. It is part of the essential business of courts and tribunals to make judgments such as these. In doing so, the general principles referred to in Article 1105(1) and similar provisions must inevitably be interpreted and applied to the particular facts.\n\n[T]he FTC interpretation makes it clear that that in Article 1105(1) the terms \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 and \u2018full protection and security\u2019 are, in the view of the NAFTA Parties, references to *existing* elements of the customary international law standard and are not intended to add novel elements to that standard. The word \u2018including\u2019 paragraph (1) supports that conclusion. To say that these elements are included in the standard of treatment under international law suggests that Article 1105 does not intend to supplement or add to that standard. But it does not follow that the phrase \u2018including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security\u2019 adds nothing to the meaning of Article 1105(1), nor did the FTC seek to read those words out of the article, a process which *would* have involved amendment rather than interpretation.\"745\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award of 11 October 2002 **(CL-66),** paras. 118, 122 (emphasis in original).\n\n361.\n\nThe Tribunal underwrites all of these observations, including in particular the *Mondev* tribunal\u2019s observation that \"[a] judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case.\"746 The Mondev tribunal rightly stressed that \"[i]t is part of the essential business of courts and tribunals to make judgments such as these;\" and that \"[i]n doing so, the general principles referred to in Article 1105(1) and similar provisions must inevitably be interpreted and applied to the particular facts.\"747\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award of 11 October 2002 **(CL-66),** para. 118.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award of 11 October 2002 **(CL-66),** para. 118.\n\n362.\n\nIn other words, just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating (and not in its description), the ultimate test of correctness of an interpretation is not in its description in other words, but in its application on the facts.\n\n**(b) The determination of whether the Respondent is in breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n363.\n\nAs summarized above, the Claimant contends that the Respondent breached Article 1105(1) of NAFTA by imposing a moratorium on the development of offshore wind, which was contrary to the representations and commitments made by the Respondent when encouraging the Claimant to invest in the development of offshore wind in Ontario, and by failing to respect its promise to ensure that the moratorium would not penalize the Claimant. The Claimant also contends that the Respondent breached Article 1105(1) by treating other investors, specifically TransCanada and Samsung, more favorably by offering them alternative projects.\n\n364.\n\nThe Respondent denies all of these allegations, contending that the development of offshore wind was deferred in order to ensure that the regulatory framework would be backed by solid scientific research. The Respondent acknowledges that the cost of offshore wind, and its impact on ratepayers, was also a consideration when the decision to defer the development of offshore wind was taken, but this was an entirely legitimate concern. The Respondent contends that, following the moratorium, it took reasonable measures to accommodate the Claimant, but the Claimant failed to pursue the available options and instead made unreasonable and unrealistic demands. The Respondent also denies that there was any discrimination.\n\n365.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence produced by the Parties surrounding the moratorium and the subsequent conduct of the Parties, in order to determine whether Article 1105(1) of NAFTA. might have been breached.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that following the signing of the FIT Contract on 20 August 2010, the position of the Government of Ontario grew gradually more ambiguous towards the development of offshore wind. Thus, while the Government appears to have envisaged still in August 2010 that the relevant regulatory framework, including the setback requirements, would be in place possibly, [REDACTED]748 its position started changing in the fall of 2010. This change appears to have coincided with the receipt and analysis of the information generated through the EBR posting of 25 June 2010, which indicated an increasing resistance to the development of offshore wind.749 Thus, while the MOE in a workshop held on 31 August 2010 [REDACTED], on 16 September 2010 MOE staff in a presentation to the Deputy Minister of the Environment [REDACTED].750 The briefing note specifically reported on the EBR comments, noting that two thirds of the comments opposed offshore wind development. In November 2010, MOE forwarded to MNR and MEI officials an outline for a strategy for the development of offshore wind, which stressed the need for further technical and environmental research, [REDACTED] but envisaged that \"[t]he required research will not delay the implementation of any off-shore wind projects.\"751 On 7 December 2010, the officials of the MEI, MOE and MNR met to discuss \"ways to move away from the off-shore development,\" while possibly going ahead with the Windstream project as a pilot. It was noted that the OPA was considering its options, including legal and financial risks \"associated with not pursuing off-shore.\"752\n\nMOE, Presentation, \"Off-Shore Wind Noise Requirements: Technical Workshop Findings: Path Forward -Options\" **(R-140).**\n\nMOE, Preliminary Summary of EBR Comments (EBR Registry # 011-0089, undated **(R-421).** The Discussion Paper was posted on the Environmental Registry on 25 June 2010 for a period of 60 days until 23 August 2010, but was subsequently extended until 7 September 2010.\n\nMOE, Presentation, \"Off-Shore Wind Noise Requirements: Deputy Minister\u2019s Briefing\" (\"Noise Requirements DM Briefing #3) of 29 September 2010 **(R-152).** *See also* MOE, Presentation, \"Off-Shore Wind Noise Requirements: Technical Workshop Findings: Path Forward - Options\" **(R-140).**\n\nGovernment of Ontario, Presentation, \"Offshore Wind Development: Strategies for a Path Forward\" of 16 November 2010 **(R-178),** p. 10.\n\nEmail from Zaveri, Mirrun (MEI) to Slawner, Karen (MEI) et al. of 8 December 2010 **(C-403).**\n\n367.\n\nIt does not appear from the evidence that the various options that were being considered and the related concerns were communicated to Windstream, either at the meetings between the government officials and Windstream representatives or otherwise. On 10 December 2010, Windstream delivered a force majeure notice to the OPA, effective from 22 November 2010, stating that MNR\u2019s failure to proceed with the permitting process, in particular the site release process, and MOE\u2019s failure to take steps to implement its policy proposal to create an exclusion zone, had prevented Windstream from progressing the Project in accordance with the FIT Contract.753\n\nWindstream\u2019s Notice of Force Majeure of 10 December 2010 **(C-408);** Exhibit A to Windstream\u2019s Notice of Force Majeure **(C-406).**\n\n368.\n\nOn 6 January 2011, the representatives of MNR, MEI, MOE and the Premier\u2019s Office held an energy issues meeting. At the meeting, MEI made a presentation stating that, while there was \"significant potential for offshore wind development in the Great Fakes,\" extensive offshore wind development could have a \"substantial impact\" on electricity costs for Ontario consumers given the prices paid for output, and that the EBR process had indicated that there were significant concerns relating to the development of offshore wind power.754 [REDACTED] options were outlined for the development of offshore wind : [REDACTED].755\n\nPresentation (MEI), Offshore Wind: Options for Moving Forward of 6 January 2011 **(C-430).**\n\nPresentation (MEI), Offshore Wind: Options for Moving Forward of 6 January 2011 **(C-430).**\n\n369.\n\nOn the following day, 7 January 2011, Minister of Environment Mr Wilkinson received a briefing memorandum from his senior policy adviser Ms Brenda Fucas which updated the Minister on the energy issues meeting that had taken place earlier during the day.756 The memorandum noted that the \"[direction from the meeting was to proceed with [REDACTED]. At the hearing, Mr Wilkinson testified that he was concerned by Ms Fucas\u2019s memorandum and called for a follow-up meeting with the Deputy Minister of the Environment which took place either on 7 or 8 January 2011. At the meeting, Mr Wilkinson put questions to the Deputy Minister on a number of issues, including the impact of the Project on drinking water, which the Deputy was not able to answer.

After the meeting, Mr Andrew Mitchell of MEI wrote to his colleagues at MNR and MOE stating that his Minister\u2019s direction was that the FIT Contract with Windstream would be respected and the Project would be allowed to proceed.759 Mr Sean Mullin of the Premier\u2019s Office indicated that he agreed, and that \"there is a desire to get this out publicly before Friday,\" while Ms Lucas of MOE indicated that \"Minister Wilkinson still has reservations.\"760 However, in a separate email of the same date, Mr Craig MacLennan of MEI wrote to Mr Mullin of the Premier's Office that \"[REDACTED]\"761 Subsequent correspondence suggests that a consensus emerged in the following two weeks that [REDACTED].762\n\nHearing Transcript (18 February 2016), 357:17 to 361:8.\n\nEmail from MacLennan, Craig (MEI) to Morley, Chris (OPO) of 24 January 2011 **(C-943).**\n\nEmail from Lucas, Brenda (ENE) to Mullin, Sean (OPO) et al. of 24 January 2011 **(C-942).** It is noted in this email: \"[r]espect the OPA FIT contract and allow the project to proceed;\" and \"[a]dvise Windstream that we will proceed with their project.\"\n\nEmail from Lucas, Brenda (ENE) to Mullin, Sean (OPO) et al. of 24 January 2011 **(C-942).**\n\nEmail from MacLennan, Craig (MEI) to Morley, Chris (OPO) of 24 January 2011 **(C-943).**\n\nEmail from Mitchell, Andrew (MEI) to MacLennan, Craig (MEI) and Mullin, Sean (OPO) of 28 January 2011 **(C-959).**\n\n371.\n\nThe decision on the moratorium was eventually communicated to Windstream during a conference call on 11 February 2011,763 The transcript and the audio recording of the call show that the decision came as a surprise to Windstream, whose representatives indicated that they had been expecting an announcement on the setbacks.764 During the call, the Government officials confirmed that the Project was not terminated, and that it would go forward once the science studies had been completed:\n\n\"[Andrew Mitchell of MEI:] Our feeling is that offshore wind in freshwater lakes is in its early developments and to date there are gaps that exist in the science that don\u2019t support siting wind projects in freshwater at this time....

We certainly can meet with you for clarification, but what I am hearing very clearly is the project has been terminated by the government.\n\n[Perry Cecchini of the OPA:] No you are not hearing that.\"766\n\nAudio Recording of Call of 11 February 2011 **(C-483);** Transcription of Audio Recording of Telephone Conference Call of 11 February 2011 **(C-484).**\n\nTranscription of Audio Recording of Telephone Conference Call of 11 February 2011 **(C-484),** pp. 5-6 (Mr Baines stating that \"[t]his comes as I\u2019ll be honest as a terrible shock to us and to our investor, I invited David Mars from New York to be on the line because we had every reason to believe that we would be hearing that the set-back announcement would be resolved and we could move forward and what I\u2019m hearing is the exact opposite so it is quite a shock...\").\n\nTranscription of Audio Recording of Telephone Conference Call of 11 February 2011 **(C-484),** p. 2.\n\nTranscription of Audio Recording of Telephone Conference Call of 11 February 2011 **(C-484),** p. 6.\n\n372.\n\nOn the same day, the Ontario government issued a press release, announcing that it would not be proceeding with offshore wind development,767 and the MOE and MNR posted decision notices to the same effect on Ontario\u2019s Environmental Registry.768 There were no changes made to the regulatory framework, including the REA Regulation and Wind Policy 4.10.04, which continued to envisage the development of offshore wind.769\n\nNews Release (MOE), Ontario Rules Out Offshore Wind Projects of 11 February 2011 **(C-485).**\n\nPolicy Decision Notice (MOE), Renewable Energy Approval Requirements for Off-Shore Wind Facilities -An Overview of the Proposed Approach (EBR Registry Number: 011-0089) of 2 February 2011 **(C-725);** Decision on Policy (MNR), Offshore Wind Power: Consideration of Additional Areas to be Removed from Future Development of 11 February 2011 **(C-482).**\n\nPolicy No. PL 4.10.04 (MNR), Wind Power Site Release and Development Review - Crown Land of 28 January 2008 **(C-59);** *Environmental Protection Act,* Ontario Regulation 359/09 **(C-103).**\n\n373.\n\nStarting in the spring of 2011 and continuing until 2012, several communications, meetings and discussions took place between WWIS and the OPA, in an attempt to agree on the required changes to the FIT Contract to reflect the moratorium. While the parties were able to agree on waiving the OPA\u2019s pre-NTP termination rights under Section 2.4(a) of the FIT Contract, and although the OPA accepted WWIS\u2019s force majeure claim retroactively from 22 November 2010, the discussions did not produce an agreed outcome, nor did the OPA accept WWIS\u2019s proposal to convert the offshore wind project into a solar project. The Government also did not accept WWIS proposal of 2 March 2012 to the Premier\u2019s Office to designate the Project as an \"active research project\" which would have left the moratorium in place, but would have addressed the science questions raised in connection with the moratorium.\n\n374.\n\nBy 4 May 2012, the ongoing force majeure had delayed commercial operation for more than 24 months after the original MCOD, which in turn triggered the right of the OPA to unilaterally terminate the FIT Contract. Consequently, in the absence of any further amendments to the FIT Contract to address the suspension, as of this date the Project effectively became non-financeable,770\n\n*See* para. 100 above. *See also* Article 10.1(g) of the FIT Contract: \"If, by reason of one or more events of Force Majeure, the Commercial Operation Date is delayed by such event(s) of Force Majeure for an aggregate of more than 24 months after the original Milestone Date for Commercial Operation (prior to any extension pursuant to Section 10.1(f), then notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon notice to the other Party and without any costs or payments of any kind to either Party, and all Completion and Performance Security shall be returned or refunded (as applicable) to the Supplier forthwith.\"\n\n375.\n\nOn 17 October 2012, Windstream fded a Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under NAFTA Chapter 11.\n\n376.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence before it, in order to determine whether the Government of Ontario\u2019s conduct during the relevant period could be characterized as unfair and inequitable and thus in breach of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. The Tribunal is unable to find that the Government of Ontario\u2019s decision to impose a moratorium on offshore wind development, or the process that led to it, were in themselves wrongful. The Tribunal notes that, while the conduct of the Ontario Government during the period leading up to the moratorium could have been more transparent, and although Windstream was kept in the dark as to the evolving policy position of the Government while Windstream continued to invest in the Project, the Government\u2019s evolving position was at least in part driven by a genuine policy concern that there was not sufficient scientific support for establishing an appropriate setback, or exclusion zone, for offshore wind projects.\n\n377.\n\nAt the same time, however, the evidence before the Tribunal suggests that the decision to impose the moratorium was not only driven by the lack of science. The impact of offshore wind on electricity costs in Ontario, as well as the upcoming provincial elections in November 2011, also appear to have influenced the decision, and the latter in particular in light of the public opposition to offshore wind that had emerged during the relevant period in many parts of rural Ontario (although not in Kingston, where the Project was located). Again, however, the Tribunal is unable to find, on the basis of the evidence before it, that these concerns were the predominant reason for the moratorium, or that the decision to impose the moratorium amounted to a breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA. just because the Government failed to communicate these other concerns when imposing the moratorium.\n\n378.\n\nAs to the period following the moratorium, the Tribunal notes that, while the MOE developed research plans relating to offshore wind,771 and while it appears that the Government did conduct some studies,772 the Government on the whole did relatively little to address the scientific uncertainty surrounding offshore wind that it had relied upon as the main publicly cited reason for the moratorium. Indeed, many of the research plans did not go forward at all, including some for lack of funding, and at the hearing counsel for the Respondent confirmed that Ontario did not plan to conduct any further studies. Nor have the studies that have been conducted led to any amendments to the regulatory framework.\n\nMOE, Offshore Wind Development Research Plan, Vol. 3 of 5 April 2011 **(R-232);** Presentation (MOE), Offshore Wind Power Development - Proposed Research Plan, MO Briefing of 17 February 2012 **(C-598);** Presentation (MOE), Offshore Wind Power Development - Proposed Research Plan (Confidential) of May 2012 **(C-611);** MOE, \"Offshore Wind Power - Ministry of the Environment Research Plan\" of 22 March 2013 **(R-334).**\n\n*See, e.g.,* Report (MNR), Nienhuis, Sarah and Dunlop, Erin S., \"The Potential Effects of Offshore Wind Power Projects on Fish and Fish Habitat in the Great Lakes,\" Aquatic Research Series 2011-01 of 6 July 2011 **(C-543);** Reid, Scott, Murrant, Meghan and Dunlop, Erin, MNR Aquatic Research and Development Section Report, \"Impacts of Electromagnetic Fields from the Wolfe Island Wind Power Project Submarine Cable on Fish Biodiversity and Distribution: 2011-12 Project Report on Nearshore Fish Community Sampling\" **(R-194);** Report (MOE), Application of the MIKE3 model to examine water quality impacts within Lake Ontario nearshore in 2008 of 28 December 2012 **(C-637).** These studies were released after Windstream had served its Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration under NAFTA Chapter 11.\n\n379.\n\nMost importantly, the Government did little to address the legal and contractual limbo in which Windstream found itself after the imposition of the moratorium. While the regulatory framework continued to envisage the development of offshore wind, additional and more detailed regulations governing offshore wind specifically were never developed. The Government let the OPA conduct the negotiations with Windstream even if the decision on the moratorium had been taken by the Government and not by the OPA, and without providing any direction to the OPA for the negotiations although it had the authority to do so under the GEGEA (a power it had exercised when introducing the FIT program). As a result, as the negotiations between the OPA and Windstream failed to produce results, by May 2012 the Project had a reached a point at which it was no longer financeable. Nonetheless, the Government failed to clarify the situation, either by way of promptly completing the required scientific research and establishing the appropriate regulatory framework for offshore wind and reactivating Windstream\u2019s FIT Contract, or by amending the relevant regulations so as to exclude offshore wind altogether as a source of renewable energy and terminating Windstream\u2019s FIT Contract in accordance with the applicable law. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Government\u2019s conduct vis-\u00e0-vis Windstream during the period following the imposition of the moratorium was unfair and inequitable within the meaning of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA..\n\n380.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the failure of the Government of Ontario to take the necessary measures, including when necessary by way of directing the OPA, within a reasonable period of time after the imposition of the moratorium to bring clarity to the regulatory uncertainty surrounding the status and the development of the Project created by the moratorium, constitutes a breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA.. It was indeed the Government of Ontario that imposed the moratorium, not the OPA, so it cannot be said that the resulting regulatory and contractual limbo was a result of the Claimant\u2019s own failure to negotiate a reasonable settlement with the OPA. The regulatory and contractual limbo in which the Claimant found itself in the years following the imposition of the moratorium was a result of acts and omissions of the Government of Ontario, and as such is attributable to the Respondent. The Tribunal therefore need not consider whether the conduct of the OPA during the relevant period must also be considered attributable to the Respondent.773\n\nIn view of its findings, the Tribunal also need not consider whether an adverse inference should be drawn, as requested by the Claimant, in light of the evidence that some of the emails relating to the Project may have been intentionally deleted by officials of the Premier\u2019s Office. *See* para. 173 above.\n\n381.\n\n[REDACTED].774 Indeed, the evidence before the Tribunal suggests that the Government expected that Windstream would bring legal action to settle the consequences of the moratorium, which the Government was unable to address within a reasonable period of time either by way of appropriate regulatory action or by way of an appropriate direction to the OPA.\n\nPresentation (MEI), Offshore Wind: Options for Moving Forward (Draft 3) of 13 January 2011 **(C-921).**\n\n382.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent is in breach of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA..\n\n**C.

As the only developer of an offshore wind project that was awarded a FIT Contract, the Claimant argues that it was singled out and prevented from receiving the benefit of its FIT Contract when all other developers of large-scale wind projects who were awarded a FIT Contract have been allowed to proceed through the regulatory process.797\n\n**Memorial,** para. 633.\n\n**2.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n410.\n\nThe relevant provisions of NAFTA., Articles 1102 and 1103, deal with national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment, respectively. These provisions apply to both investors and investments \"with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments,\"839 insofar as the relevant investors and investments are \"in like circumstances.\"\n\n*See* NAFTA Article 1102(1) ***in fine,*** Article 1102(2) ***in fine,*** Article 1103(1) ***in fine,*** and Article 1103(2) *in fine.*\n\n411.\n\nThe Parties disagree on a number of issues, including whether the Claimant can be considered to have been in \"like circumstances\" to TransCanada and Samsung, as well as whether the Claimant\u2019s claims are excluded by virtue of the procurement exception in Article 1108(7)(a) of NAFTA, which provides that \"Articles 1102, 1103 and 1107 do not apply to... procurement by a Party or a State enterprise.\"\n\n412.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s treatment of Windstream was less favorable than that of TransCanada, a Canadian company, and that the two companies were \"in like circumstances.\" Similarly, the Claimant argues that the Respondent\u2019s treatment of Windstream was less favorable than that of Samsung, a South Korean company, which also was allegedly \"in like circumstances.\" The Claimant further contends that every other developer of large-scale wind projects that had been awarded a FIT Contract at the same time as the Claimant was allowed to develop its projects.\n\n413.\n\nThe Respondent, in turn, contends that the Claimant\u2019s investment was accorded treatment in its capacity as a participant in the FIT Program, a renewable energy procurement program with standardized rules, prices and contracts. However, TransCanada and Samsung were not \"in like circumstances\" as they had made their investment in an entirely different legal context and neither had applied for Crown land to develop an offshore wind facility. TransCanada\u2019s contract was issued pursuant to a request for proposals (\"RFP\") for a gas-fired plant, and thus did not involve renewable energy, whereas Samsung had entered into an investment agreement, the Green Energy Investment Agreement, with the Ontario Government for the construction of 2,500 MW renewable energy generation project consisting of both wind and solar power.\n\n414.\n\nHaving considered the Parties\u2019 positions and the supporting evidence, the Tribunal is satisfied that the treatment accorded to the Claimant cannot be considered to have been in \"like circumstances.\" Unlike TransCanada and Samsung, the Claimant had a FIT Contract for offshore wind development, and indeed it was the only holder of such a contract. Accordingly, the moratorium and the related measures did not apply to TransCanada and Samsung in the first place, which therefore were not affected by them. The Tribunal further notes that the moratorium only applied to offshore wind and that it was not applied in a non-discriminatory manner in that it resulted in the cancellation of all offshore wind projects, with the exception of that of the Claimant, which was the only holder of a FIT Contract. The Tribunal is therefore unable to agree that the Claimant was treated less favorably than other prospective developers of offshore wind projects, which were the only proponents that could be said to have been in \"like circumstances.\"\n\n415.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal need not consider whether the procurement exception in Article 1108(7)(a) of NAFTA. applies to the procurement of electricity by the OPA for purposes of resale in the Ontario electricity market.\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s claims for breach of Articles 1102 and 1103 of NAFTA. therefore stand to be dismissed.\n\n**VI. THE DAMAGE SUSTAINED BY THE CLAIMANT**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n**1. The Applicable Legal Standards**\n-------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nThe Claimant contends that it is entitled to damages in an amount sufficient to wipe out all the economic losses suffered by it as a result of Canada\u2019s NAFTA breaches, as calculated in the expert reports of Messrs Richard Taylor and Robert Fow of Deloitte (the \"Deloitte reports\").840 In the Claimant\u2019s view, the Respondent\u2019s imposition of the moratorium together with its failure to meet its promise in keeping the Claimant whole rendered the Claimant\u2019s investment effectively worthless.841\n\n**Memorial,** para. 647.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 661.\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, because NAFTA does not describe a method for determining reparation for illegal acts, customary international law applies. The proper authority on this issue is the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* decision of the Permanent Court of International Justice,842 which established that a State responsible for an illegal act \"must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would in all probability have existed if the act had not been committed.\"843\n\n**Memorial,** para. 649; Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 99:17-20.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 649; *Case Concerning the Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v. Poland)* (P.C.I.J., ser. A, no. 17), Judgment of 13 September 1928 **(CL-34),** para. 125.\n\n419.\n\nAs to the date for calculating damages, the Claimant takes the view that in cases of unlawful expropriations an investor can choose between the date of the expropriation and the date on which a tribunal renders its award.844 Contrary to the Respondent\u2019s submission,845 the Claimant contends that it is not relevant whether NAFTA tribunals have adopted this approach.846 The Claimant explains that NAFTA tribunals have \"considerable discretion in fashioning what they believe to be reasonable approaches to damages.\"847 Accordingly, the Tribunal has discretion in following the decisions of other tribunals establishing that the Claimant may choose either the date of breach or the date of the award as a valuation date.848 According to the Claimant, the right to choose between calculating damages based on the date of the breach and calculating damages based on the date of the award \"applies equally to damages arising from Canada\u2019s breaches of Articles 1105(1), 1102 and 1103.\"849 In this context, the Claimant takes the position that the appropriate valuation date is the date of the award.850 At the same time, the Claimant also advances its alternative position that the appropriate valuation date is 22 May 2012, which is the date of the breach.851\n\n**Memorial,** para. 659; **Reply,** para. 738.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 515.\n\n**Reply,** para. 739.\n\n**Reply,** para. 739; *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v.

According to the Claimant, the \"damages resulting from Canada\u2019s breach of Article 1102 are the same as its damages resulting from Canada\u2019s breach of Article 1105(1).\"854\n\n**Memorial,** para. 664.\n\n422.\n\nFinally, as to the alleged breach of Article 1103, the Claimant contends that it is entitled to be put in the position in which it would have been had the Respondent awarded the solar project to the Claimant instead of Samsung.855 The Claimant submits that calculating the damages arising from a breach of Article 1103 \"would involve an alternate DCF [Discounted Cash Flow] analysis,\" which it has not performed, but proposes to prepare it if \"the Tribunal were to dismiss Windstream\u2019s claims for breaches of Articles 1110, 1105(1) and 1102 but allow Windstream\u2019s claim for breach of Article 1103.\"856\n\n**Memorial,** para. 665.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 665.\n\n**2. The Discounted Cash Flow Method is Appropriate**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n423.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the appropriate method for calculating damages in this case, in which the \"investment has been rendered substantially worthless,\" is the Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\") method that allows one \"to determine the value the investment would have had \u2018but for\u2019 the illegal act.\"857 The Claimant explains that this method measures the \"present value of the future cash flows available to equity\"858 \"in a hypothetical world but for the breach\"859 and that it is deemed appropriate when the projected cash flows are capable of determination and are not speculative.860\n\n**Memorial,** para. 666.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 667.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 668.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 669.\n\n424.\n\nContrary to the Respondent\u2019s contention,861 the Claimant asserts that its hypothetical cash flows from the Project can be determined with a reasonable degree of certainty.862 The Claimant submits that the Project would more likely than not have achieved commercial operation and even generated revenues, but for the moratorium.863 According to the Claimant, the Project did not face significant regulatory risks864 and would have received the required approvals.865 The Claimant also argues that it would also have received tenure to the Crown land necessary to develop the Project,866 which was technically feasible867 and financeable.868\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** paras. 563-565.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 673.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 672.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 672; **CER-Powell,** paras. 106-110.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 672; **CER-Baird,** p. 99; **CER-Kerlinger,** para. 3; **CER-Reynolds,** p. 20; **CER-Oretch,** p. 10.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 672; **CER-Powell,** para. 107.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 672; **CER-SgurrEnergy,** p. 5.\n\n**Memorial,** para. 672; **CER-Baird,** p. 99; **CER-Kerlinger,** para. 3; **CER-Reynolds,** p. 20; **CER-Oretch,** p. 10.\n\n425.\n\nThe Claimant further points out that the cash flows from the Project \"can be forecast with a relatively high degree of confidence,\" because \"(i) the price per kilowatt for electricity sold by the Project is established by contract, (ii) the Project\u2019s projected electricity output can be reasonably estimated on the basis of numerous high-quality and independently prepared wind resource assessments, (iii) the majority of the Project\u2019s capital costs and operating costs would have been contractual and therefore can be determined using benchmark data, and (iv) engineering for the Project would not have involved the use of any novel technology.\"869 In any event, the DCF methodology accounts for future uncertainties and risks through the application of an appropriate discount rate.870 The Claimant emphasizes that, as a consequence, tribunals have accepted the DCF methodology in a number of cases involving projects or companies that faced future risks.871\n\n**Reply,** para. 646; **CER-Taylor/Low-2,** para. 2.5; Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 125:4-14.\n\n**Reply,** para. 652; Hearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 113:10 to 114:4-8.\n\n**Reply,** para. 655; *Gold Reserve Inc. v.

The Comparable Transaction Methodology as an Alternative Approach**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n428.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal rejects the DCF method, the Claimant suggests that the comparable transaction approach, which \"determines project value on the basis of transactions involving projects at a similar stage of development\" would be \"the second most-appropriate methodology.\"876 According to the Claimant, this approach is \"appropriate to determine the value of Windstream\u2019s investments because precedent transaction multiples would reflect value attributed to the FIT Contract and turbine contracts and other characteristics of the Project, such as wind data and resource assessments, seismic, engineering and electrical interconnection work.\"877\n\n**Reply,** para. 662.\n\n**Reply,** para. 662; **CER-Taylor/Low-2,** para. 2.3.\n\n429.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimant contends that the Investment Value approach proposed by the Respondent878 severely undervalues the Claimant\u2019s investment.879 Referring to Deloitte\u2019s expert report, the Claimant argues that the Investment Value approach is inappropriate because it ascribes no value to the FIT Contract, which according to the Claimant is its most valuable asset.880 Specifically, the Claimant points to market research conducted by Deloitte to establish that FIT Contracts have significant value beyond the investment costs associated with project development.881 The Claimant also contends that the experts from both sides agree that the FIT Contract is a valuable asset.882\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** paras. 560-565.\n\n**Reply,** para. 664.\n\n**Reply,** para. 664; **CER-Taylor/Low-2,** para. 2.3.\n\n**Reply,** para. 664; **CER-Taylor/Low-2,** para. 2.3.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 12:18 to 14:24; Hearing Transcript (18 February 2016), 9:20 to 10:5; Hearing Transcript (18 February 2016), 195:5-11, 196:6-10; Hearing Transcript (23 February 2016), 166:5-8; Hearing Transcript (22 February 2016), 99:17-20, 100:3-7; Hearing Transcript (17 February 2016), 252:19 to 253:4.\n\n**4. Quantification of the Claimant\u2019s Losses**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nThe Claimant has quantified its losses under two scenarios, namely (a) \"in the event that the Tribunal finds the moratorium to be a breach of Articles 1101, 1105 or 1102 of NAFTA.\" and (b) \"in the event that the Tribunal finds the moratorium did not breach Articles 1110, 1105 or 1102 of NAFTA., but the failure to keep Windstream whole following the imposition of the moratorium constituted a breach of these articles.\"883\n\n**Reply,** para. 642.\n\n431.\n\nFor each of these scenarios, the Claimant has quantified its losses using the DCF method based on a valuation date of (a) 22 May 2012 and (b) 19 June 2015 (the latter being the date of Deloitte \u2019 s second report).884 The Claimant considers the former date to be \"the date of breach.\"885 The Claimant explains that \"the Project became substantially worthless on the date on which it was no longer possible for the Project to reach commercial operation before triggering the OPA\u2019s termination rights under Section 10.1(g) of the FIT Contract,\"886 adding that \"this occurred as of May 22, 2012.\"887 The Claimant therefore contends that it is entitled to damages calculated on the basis of 22 May 2012 or on the basis of the date of the award, whichever amount is higher.888\n\n**Reply,** para. 641.\n\n**Reply,** para. 641.\n\n**Reply,** para. 729.\n\n**Reply,** para. 729.

The Claimant Bears the Burden of Proof**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n445.\n\nThe Respondent points out that, for the Claimant to be able to claim damages, it needs to prove that the alleged NAFTA breaches caused it actual and specific loss.928 According to the Respondent, the Claimant fails to meet this burden of proof, since \"[t]he Project has never been anything more than a speculative and unrealistic venture\" with \"no material value in the market place,\" and \"what Windstream considered its most valuable asset, the FIT Contract, turned out to be an insurmountable hurdle.\"929 As a consequence, the Respondent takes the view that \"not only should the Claimant be unable to recover any damages for its alleged future lost profits, it would also be inappropriate for the Tribunal to award the Claimant any of its investment costs.\"930 The Respondent submits that a claim for lost profits must be grounded upon appropriate data which can be known with a sufficient degree of certainty.931\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 517.\n\n**Rejoinder,** paras. 255-257.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 257; Hearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 222:11 to 223:9.\n\nHearing Transcript (15 February 2016), 223:23-25.\n\n446.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the Claimant \"significantly [altered] its programme and schedule\" in its Reply submission, thus demonstrating that the Claimant\u2019s original planning suffered from deficiencies, a \"lack of preparatory work,\" and an \"underestimation... of the complexities associated with a project of this magnitude.\"932 The Respondent claims that \"[t]hrough the 2015 redesign of its Project, the Claimant has tacitly admitted that its initial plans would have resulted in Project failure.\"933 According to the Respondent, the \"Claimant should not get the benefit of information and analysis only available in 2015 to prove in hindsight that its Project had value\" and the Project\u2019s feasibility should rather \"be assessed as it was planned by Windstream in 2010/2011.\"934 In any event, the Respondent suggests that \"[e]ven under the new 2015 programme, the Claimant would not have been able to develop its Project in the timelines required by its FIT Contract.\"935\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 267; **RER-URS-2,** paras. 4, 181.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 267.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 268.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 269.\n\n447.\n\nThe Respondent also criticizes the Claimant\u2019s calculation of damages for a breach of Article 1102 of NAFTA, arguing that \"the Claimant has made no effort to explain how there is a causal link between the treatment accorded to TransCanada and the fact that the Claimant could not bring its Project into commercial operation.\"936 As to the alleged breach of Article 1103 of NAFTA., the Respondent points out that \"the Claimant did not even attempt to quantify the losses it allegedly suffered.\"937\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 270.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 270.\n\n**2. Valuation Date**\n---------------------\n\n448.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the Claimant\u2019s assertion that it is entitled to choose between a valuation as of the alleged expropriation date and a valuation as of the date of the award.938 The Respondent takes the position that \"the only relevant date is the date of the breach.\"939 The Respondent\u2019s expert used 22 May 2012 as the valuation date for most of its analysis, except for one of the alleged breaches of Article 1105 of NAFTA., where 11 February 2011 was used.940 In doing so, the Respondent contends that the Claimant fails to rely on any NAFTA award or justification to support its approach.941 According to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s reliance on *Feldman* and *S.D. Myers* is inappropriate because neither of these decisions involves damages claims based on expropriation.942 The Respondent also stresses that \"it should not be for the Claimant to, on one hand reap the benefits of an increase, while on the other hand, if the value of the investment has decreased... ask for the higher valuation on the date of expropriation.\"943\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 515; **Memorial,** paras. 658-660; Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 219:8-13.\n\nHearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 219:14-15.\n\nHearing Transcript (24 February 2016), 170:5-17.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 515; Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 220:14-20.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 319 (referring to *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant has failed to meet the burden to show that, despite the construction and development risks associated with the Project, profits would have been realized.993 The Respondent further asserts that the commercial risks involved in *Karaha Bodas* v. *PLN* are distinguishable from the project risks in the present case.994 Similarly, the Claimant\u2019s FIT Contract is distinguishable from the contract in *Ioan Micula v. Romania* because the Claimant does not have a \"guaranteed revenue stream or level of profit.\"995 Moreover, none of the present circumstances are analogous to the circumstances in *Khan Resources v.

No Evidence of Damage as a Result of the Failure to Lift the Deferral or Insulate the Claimant from the Effects of the Deferral**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n466.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it was impossible for the Respondent to cause any damage to the Claimant because the Claimant\u2019s Project already had no market value on the purported valuation date, 22 May 2012. By this date, it was \"a foregone conclusion\" that the Project would fail to meet the time frames specified in the FIT Contract, and \"because of its riskiness and its high costs.\"1015\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 315.\n\n467.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s assumption in this scenario \"that the FIT Contract is frozen for three years\" is \"of no use to this Tribunal,\" as the Claimant \"puts forward no evidence to show why imposing an arbitrary three year deferral would put it in the position it would have been in had Ontario kept the Claimant\u2019s FIT Contract \u2018frozen\u2019 during the deferral.\"1016 The Respondent claims that \"the correct \u2018but for\u2019 scenario is the same as that used if the failure to lift the deferral by May 22, 2012 is seen as the breach.\"1017\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 318.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 318.\n\n468.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent submits that the same development and construction risks that apply for the 11 February 2011 scenario also apply to this scenario.1018 In both scenarios, the Claimant would have failed to bring the Project into Commercial Operation by the time frames required by the FIT Contract.1019 According to the Respondent, the delay in the Project restart date from 11 February 2011 to 22 May 2012 means that the Project would not have reached Commercial Operation until 28 October 2019 - a full year after the Supplier\u2019s Default Date.1020\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 323.\n\n**Rejoinder,** paras. 323-327.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 325; **RER-URS-2,** paras. 70, 483.\n\n**5. In the Alternative, the Claimant Failed to Prove its Investment Costs**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n469.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that the Project is unlikely to have been sold for \"even the value of its sunk costs at the date of the breach.\"1021 As such, the Claimant should not be entitled to any investment costs.1022 In the event that the Tribunal finds that the Claimant could have brought its Project into Commercial Operation within the time frames of the Contract and that the Project had a positive value, the Claimant should only be entitled to investment costs.1023 Even then, the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden in proving the quantum of such costs.1024\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 328.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 328.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** paras. 560-565; **Rejoinder,** para. 328.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 329.\n\n470.\n\nThe Respondent lists four reasons that would preclude the Tribunal from awarding any compensation for the Claimant\u2019s investment costs. First, the Claimant\u2019s reliance on *Vivendi II* is misplaced because the tribunal did not hold that approximations were allowed in the context of investment costs.1025 Second, the Claimant has included in its calculations numerous expenditures that were made after the date of the alleged breaches.1026 Third, the Claimant should not be entitled to certain sunk costs that were incurred prior to the breach or costs that it was unreasonable to incur.1027 Finally, the evidence submitted by the Claimant does not support the quantum of the losses it claims.1028\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 330.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 331; **RER-BRG-2,** Attachment 3, paras. 40-41, 44-47; **CER-Taylor/Low-2,** Schedule 3b.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 332.\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 333.\n\n471.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that if the Tribunal were to decide that the Claimant is entitled to investment costs, the Claimant should be awarded only \"a fraction\" of its alleged expenditures of CAD 17 million.1029 In particular, the Respondent claims that an audit of the evidence provided by the Claimant shows that as of 25 June 2010 (the date on which the Claimant knew that the Project might not proceed) the Claimant\u2019s investment amounted to only CAD 0,208 million.1030 By 22 November 2010 (the date the Project entered into force majeure status) the Claimant had invested CAD 0,528 million.1031 By 11 February 2011 (the date ofthe deferral) the Claimant had invested CAD 0,921 million.1032 Finally, by 22 May 2012 (the Claimant\u2019s own valuation date) it had spent only CAD 1,746 million.1033\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 334.

The Claimant has not Proven it is Entitled to Pre-Judgment Interest**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n472.\n\nThe Respondent agrees that if interest is to be awarded, a 3% interest rate annually compounded should be used.1034 The Respondent asserts that, while the Tribunal has discretion in awarding interest, \"the Claimant bears the burden of proving that the circumstances of this case justify an award of interest to ensure full reparation.\"1035 In this case, the Respondent contends that the Claimant fails to establish why full reparations can only be met with an award of interest.1036\n\n**Rejoinder,** para. 335.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 568.\n\n**Counter-Memorial,** para. 568; Hearing Transcript (26 February 2016), 224:1-4.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n473.\n\nHaving found that the Respondent is in breach of its obligations under Article 1105(1) of NAFTA., the Tribunal must determine the relief that the Claimant is entitled to as a result of the breach. The Tribunal recalls that the purpose of the compensation to be awarded is to make the Claimant \"whole,\" keeping in mind the Tribunal\u2019s determination that the Claimant has not lost the entire value of its investment as the FIT Contract is still formally in force (albeit under an extended force majeure) and, accordingly, as the CAD 6 million letter of credit is still available to the Claimant and has not been lost or taken by the Government. The compensation to be awarded to the Claimant must therefore reflect the Claimant\u2019s loss (damage to the investment) rather than the full value of the investment. This latter would be relevant only if the Claimant has lost the entirety of its investment as a result of an expropriation, which is not the case here.\n\n474.\n\nAs a first step, the Tribunal must determine the appropriate method of valuation, taking into account the development stage of the Project. The evidence before the Tribunal indicates that there are three critical value milestones for offshore wind projects: (a) permitting (early stage); (b) contracting, financing and construction (late stage); and (c) operations.1037 The early development stage ends when the developer has site control, grid access and the revenue regime (e.g., FIT Contract) in place and when the project is fully permitted, whereas the late development stage ends when the project becomes operational. The value of the project increases as it moves along in this continuum of project development. According to Dr J\u00e9r\u00f4me Guillet of Green Giraffe, while the DCF method is used in the industry to value offshore wind projects, it is not usually used for projects that have not yet reached financial closure, given the many risks and uncertainties surrounding such projects.1038\n\n*See* **RER-Green Giraffe,** pp. 18-25. The Deloitte reports similarly distinguish between early-stage, late-stage, under construction and installed projects; *see* **CER-Taylor/Low,** para. 4.68.\n\n**RER-Green Giraffe,** paras. 22, 94.\n\n475.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, while the Claimant did have a FIT Contract and a grid connection, it did not yet have site control and the permitting process had not yet been completed. The relatively early development stage of the Project is also reflected in the investment cost, which the Claimant alleges amounts to some CAD 17.4 million (including the security deposit of CAD 6 million),1039 whereas the development cost of a fully-permitted project of a similar capacity (i.e., 300 MW) would typically be in the range of EUR 20-40 million (CAD 29-58 million at today\u2019s exchange rate).1040 The Project must therefore be considered an early-stage project. Accordingly, based on the evidence of Dr Guillet, which the Tribunal accepts, the DCF method is not an appropriate method of valuation for the Project, given its early development stage and the related risks and uncertainties.\n\nAs discussed in para. 481 below, the Tribunal does not accept that all of the CAD 17.4 million can be considered investment costs.\n\n**RER-Green Giraffe,** para. 72.\n\n476.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, in the circumstances, the Project can be best valued, and the damage to it quantified, on the basis of the comparable transactions methodology. While the Tribunal agrees, as noted by Deloitte, that there are limitations in directly applying transaction references in the context of the Project due to the different geographic areas served, terms of power pricing agreements, wind levels and project size, the evidence relating to comparable transactions is the best evidence before it, and the Tribunal finds it reasonable to rely on this evidence, subject to any adjustments that may be necessary to reflect the fact that the Claimant\u2019s investment has not been expropriated.\n\n477.\n\nThe most comprehensive evidence relating to the comparable transactions methodology was provided by Dr Guillet of Green Giraffe, and the Tribunal therefore takes his evidence as the starting point of analysis; the evidence of other experts, including that offered by Messrs Taylor and Low of Deloitte and Mr Goncalves of BRG, is referred to as appropriate.1041\n\n*See* **CER-Taylor/Low,** pp. 10, and **RER-BRG,** pp. 87-88. In relying on Dr Guillet\u2019s evidence, the Tribunal keeps in mind that some of the third-party confidential evidence underlying the Green Giraffe Report was not made available to the Claimant; *see above* paras. 63-66.\n\n478.\n\nDr Guillet testified that offshore wind projects have relatively consistent values in Europe. Depending on the development stage, the project value may range from below EUR 0.1 million/MW for projects that are not fully permitted (i.e., that do not have one of site control, permits, a revenue regime and grid access) to EUR 0.2 million/MW for fully permitted early-stage projects,1042 to approximately EUR 4 million/MW for projects that have reached financial closure, and up to EUR 4.5 million/MW for projects that have reached commercial operation.1043 As to the early-stage projects specifically, Dr Guillet\u2019s evidence on actual transactions before the Tribunal shows that the overall valuations of such projects range from EUR 0.01 million/MW to approximately EUR 0.1 million/MW, depending on the development stage, whereas late development stage projects have been sold for prices ranging from EUR 0.1 million/MW to EUR 0.5 million/MW. The evidence of Messrs Taylor and Low on late stage (fully permitted) projects indicated valuations from CAD 0.2 million/MW to CAD 0.7 million/MW, with a median of CAD 0.35 million/MW (approximately EUR 0.24 million in September 2016).1044 Their evidence is thus consistent with that of Dr Guillet for late-stage projects.\n\n**RER-Green Giraffe,** paras. 23, 94 and hearing slides, p. 10.\n\n**RER-Green Giraffe,** paras. 26, 94 and hearing slides, p. 10.\n\n**CER-Taylor/Low,** para. 4.69 (as corrected during the hearing).\n\n479.\n\nDr Guillet\u2019s evidence on early-stage projects covered six different transactions, whereas Mr Goncalves\u2019 evidence covered three of the transactions considered by Dr Guillet, as well as one additional transaction on an early-stage project (Luchterduinen) which was not included in Dr Guillet\u2019s evidence.1045 The multiples of these seven transactions range from EUR 0.01 million/MW to approximately EUR 0.1 million/MW, with a median of approximately EUR 0.08 million/MW and an average of approximately EUR 0.06 million/MW.1046 As noted above, Messrs Taylor and Low did not consider early stage projects.\n\n*See* **RER-BRG,** Figure 20 (at p. 87), which analyzes a number of pre-construction projects at various stages of development (late and early). The table was presented by the Respondent in a corrected form (including a correction to the Luchterduinen project) in its Closing Statement, at p. 258, distinguishing between early and late stage developments.\n\n\"Approximately\" 0.1 because Dr Guillet provides only an estimate for three transactions as \"< 0.1.\" The Tribunal has no basis to adjust these estimates.\n\n480.\n\nDepending on whether one relies on the median or the average multiple, and subject to any further adjustments that may be required as noted above, the evidence on comparable transactions thus suggests that the value of the Project would fall between EUR 18 million (based on the average multiple of EUR 0.06 million/MW) and EUR 24 million (based on the median multiple of EUR 0.08 million/MW).\n\n481.\n\nThe Claimant\u2019s sunk investment costs may be used as a \"reality check\" to test whether the above valuation is appropriate.1047 According to the Claimant, its sunk costs amount to approximately CAD 17 million (CAD 17,428,000). The Tribunal has taken note of the Respondent\u2019s criticism of the Claimant\u2019s calculation of its sunk costs, and although the Tribunal agrees with much of the criticism, including that the CAD 6 million security cannot be considered a \"sunk\" cost, it does not agree that no costs incurred by Windstream after May 2012 can be accepted because the Claimant argues that as of that date the Project was no longer financeable; as noted above, the FIT Contract is still in force and the Parties could have at any time revived the Project, had the Respondent promptly completed the scientific studies. Consequently, costs incurred by the Claimant after May 2012 may be taken into account, insofar as they are not to be accounted for as arbitration costs. Conversely, as the Tribunal has determined that the Project has not been lost in its entirety, but has only been damaged, not all of the costs incurred by the Claimant after May 2012 can be considered arbitration costs. Based on this yardstick, the Claimant\u2019s sunk costs would amount to some CAD 8-10 million, i.e., approximately EUR 5.5-7 million, at today\u2019s exchange rate.\n\nThe expert evidence before the Tribunal suggests that there is a relationship between the developer\u2019s investment costs and the valuation of the project, depending on the development stage; *see* **RER-Green Giraffe,** paras. 21-26, 72, 94-100.\n\n482.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, while the Claimant\u2019s sunk costs are substantially lower than the provisional valuation of EUR 18 to 24 million based on the comparable transactions method, this is not inconsistent with the evidence before the Tribunal, which suggests that a developer typically earns a \"premium\" on a project when sold, which reflects the value added to the project by the developer.1048 In the circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider that any further adjustments are necessary and concludes that EUR 0.07 million/MW (i.e., EUR 21 million), which represents the mid-point of the range of valuation reached above (EUR 18 to 24 million), is an appropriate valuation of the Project.\n\n*See supra* note 1047.\n\n483.\n\nWhile the Tribunal considers that this is the proper valuation of the Project, it should be kept in mind that, as determined above, the Claimant is not entitled to compensation for the full value of its investment: the Claimant has not lost the letter of credit, which is still in place, and the FIT Contract is still in force and could, in theory, be still revived and renegotiated if the Parties so agreed. Consequently, in order to quantify the damage caused by the Respondent\u2019s breach to the value of the Claimant\u2019s investment, a further adjustment must be made to reflect the value of the letter of credit (CAD 6 million). On the other hand, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate or necessary to make any further adjustments to reflect the fact that the FIT Contract is still formally in place; although the FIT Contract could have been reactivated and renegotiated by the Parties at any time during the period from 11 February 2011 until the date of this award, as a matter of fact this has not happened and consequently, as at the date of this award, the FIT Contract cannot be considered to have any value. (It is another matter that the Parties can create such value by reactivating and renegotiating the FIT Contract after the award, which option is still open to them.)\n\n484.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal must decide the date at which the damage to the Claimant\u2019s investment is to be quantified, as this will determine the EUR/CAD exchange rate to be applied to the EUR 0.07 million/MW valuation of the Project; it is to this CAD amount that the CAD 6 million adjustment must be applied. The Tribunal considers that, since (as determined above) the Claimant has not lost the full value of its investment, the proper date of quantification of the damage to the investment, and accordingly of the Claimant\u2019s loss, is the date of this award. It is on this date that the damage to the Claimant\u2019s investment crystallized.1049\n\nThe Tribunal notes, in this connection, that the comparable transactions on the basis of which the value of the Project is determined took place over a period of years between 2009 and 2013 and accordingly they benchmark the market value of the Project, based on its development stage (which did not substantially change since 11 February 2011), over the entirety of this period and not on any particular date.\n\n485.\n\nBased on the exchange rate of the date of the award, the value of the Project as determined above (EUR 21 million) amounts to CAD 31,182,900. Consequently, taking into account the letter of credit that still, as at the date of this award, remains available to the Claimant, the damage to the Claimant\u2019s investment, and therefore the amount of compensation that the Claimant is entitled to, amounts to CAD 25,182,900. The Tribunal determines that this amount is payable within 30 days of the notification of this award.\n\n486.\n\nIn view of the date of quantification of the Claimant\u2019s loss, the Tribunal need not take a decision on interest. Moreover, the Tribunal cannot contemplate that the Respondent will not comply with the award and therefore does not fix an interest for late payment.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nIf it is successful in this arbitration, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal order the Respondent to bear the costs of arbitration that have been incurred by the Claimant as defined in Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, in the total amount of CAD 6,474,864.84, including the following costs:\n\na. legal fees of CAD 3,323,115.01;\n\nb. costs of expert witnesses, third-party service providers and witness travel costs of CAD 2,268,712.27;\n\nc. disbursements of CAD 233,037.56; and\n\nd. Tribunal and PCA costs advanced by the Claimant of CAD 650,000.00.1050\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 1-2.\n\n488.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the legal costs are reasonable having regard to the volume of evidence and written submissions, and argues that the costs are \"well within the range of legal costs incurred by claimants in investment treaty arbitrations.\"1051\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Costs Submissions,** para. 4 (referring to a number of authorities).\n\n489.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the witness fees and third-party costs incurred by the Claimant are reasonable. Referring to summaries of its expert evidence,1052 the Claimant argues that the evidence was necessary to respond to the Respondent\u2019s arguments and to satisfy the Claimant\u2019s burden of proof (especially, to establish the reasonableness of the Claimant\u2019s decision to invest in the Project, the technical feasibility of the Project and the quantum of the Claimant\u2019s damages).1053 The Claimant notes that its costs claim does not include the costs of expert evidence already counted in its sunk cost calculation.1054\n\nThe Claimant refers to the expert evidence of: Ms Sarah Powell, Messrs Richard Taylor and Robert Low of Deloitte, Mr Remo Bucci of Deloitte, Mr Richard Aukland of 4C Offshore, SgurrEnergy, COWI, Weeks Marine, W.F. Baird & Associates Coastal Engineers, Beacon Environmental, Dr Michael Risk, Scarlett Janusas Archeology, WSP, Ortech, Dr Paul Kerlinger, Dr Scott Reynolds, Mr Brian Howe of HGC, Aercoustics, Mr Jim MacDougall of Compass Renewable Energy Consulting, Advisory, and Professor Rudolph Dolzer.\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 10-27.\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Costs Submissions,** para. 8.\n\n490.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that \"a number of the steps taken\" by the Respondent caused the Claimant to incur costs that would otherwise have been avoided. According to the Claimant, these steps included (i) the Respondent\u2019s production of documents 30 days before the Claimant\u2019s original deadline to file its Reply Memorial; (ii) the Respondent\u2019s request to strike portions of the Claimant\u2019s Memorial and evidence from the record on the ground of parliamentary privilege (which, the Claimant notes, was rejected by the Tribunal); and (iii) the inclusion of what the Claimant terms \"incorrect and unsubstantiated assertions\" in the Respondent\u2019s rejoinder expert evidence.1055 The Claimant also argues that the non-production of documents and information relied upon by the Respondent\u2019s experts, BRG and Green Giraffe, had necessitated the Claimant bringing a motion to the Tribunal to take the non-production into account when assessing the weight to be given to the expert evidence.1056 The Claimant also argues that the production of certain documents by the Respondent during the hearing caused wasted costs through Mr Cecchini needing to be recalled to testify a second time.1057\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 28-40.\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 41, 43.\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 42-43.\n\n491.\n\nIn the Claimant\u2019s view, if it is wholly successful, the Tribunal should order the Respondent to pay the Claimant\u2019s costs of arbitration in full, in accordance with the principle that costs follow the event.1058 The Claimant notes that Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules specifies that a tribunal should award the successful party its legal costs and the costs of arbitration. The Claimant considers this provision to create a rebuttable presumption that the unsuccessful party will bear these costs. The Claimant submits that this presumption is consistent with the \"increasingly common practice in investment arbitration endorsed by Canada - that costs should \u2018follow the event\u2019.\"1059\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 44-51.\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 45-50 (referring to *Chemtura Corporation v.

The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2), Award of 1 November 1999 **(RL-7),** para. 125).\n\n492.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that in cases where the claimant was not wholly successful, tribunals have awarded legal and arbitration costs because the respondent forced the claimant to initiate the arbitration. Thus, the Claimant argues that if it is partially successful, the Tribunal should order the Respondent to pay an appropriate portion ofthe Claimant\u2019s costs.1060\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 51-52 (referring to PSEG *Global Inc. and Konya Ilgin Elektrik Uretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v.

The Claimant considers this position to be without merit and lacking in arbitral precedent.1062 The Claimant denies that the decision in *European American Investment Bank v. The Slovak Republic* supports the Respondent\u2019s position. The Claimant refers instead to the cost awards in *Pope & Talbot, Rumeli, Cargill* and *PSEG,* which take an \"overall view of the case\" and award the claimant part of its legal costs when the claimant succeeds in part.1063 The Claimant also objects to the Respondent\u2019s assertion that it advanced \"untenable or frivolous claims\" that contributed to the costs of the arbitration. The Claimant maintains that its claims regarding the OPA and breaches of Articles 1102 and 1103 of NAFTA. are appropriate. In addition, the Claimant submits that its damages claim is appropriate.1064\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Reply Costs Submissions,** para. 2.\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Reply Costs Submissions,** paras. 7-8 (referring to *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

The content of the Respondent\u2019s pleadings, the Claimant observes, does not evidence that the Respondent incurred any costs in responding to those expert reports. With respect to document production, the Claimant explains that it only pursued further document production requests because of the Respondent\u2019s \"repeated failure to comply with its documentary production obligations.\"1065\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Reply Costs Submissions,** paras. 24-26.\n\n496.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the costs claimed by the Respondent are \"disproportionate and unreasonable.\" The Claimant notes that the Respondent used a larger legal team than the Claimant, and its counsel spent more than twice as many hours on the matter than the Claimant\u2019s counsel.1066\n\n**Claimant\u2019s Reply Costs Submissions,** paras. 27-28.\n\n**B. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nThe Respondent submits that pursuant to Article 1135 of NAFTA and Article 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal should direct that the costs of the arbitration be borne by the unsuccessful party, except if it determines that the circumstances require apportionment between the parties.\n\n498.\n\nThe Respondent argues that all costs should be borne by the Claimant on the basis that the claims are \"without merit.\" According to the Respondent, these costs include the Respondent\u2019s share of the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses and the Respondent\u2019s legal and other costs. The Respondent claims a total amount of CAD 8,261,052.35, which consists of the following:\n\na. arbitration costs of CAD 650,000;\n\nb. lawyer fees of CAD 4,215,554.93;\n\nc. expert and consultant costs of CAD 3,225,912.58; and\n\nd. additional disbursements of CAD 169,584.84.1067\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 2, 5, Annex I, Annex II.\n\n499.\n\nThe Respondent submits that its costs are reasonable, stating that \"[significant resources were necessary to defend this case, owing to the Claimant\u2019s numerous allegations of NAFTA. breaches, involving three provincial government ministries, the OPA, and former political staff, as well as to the Claimant\u2019s inappropriate claim for lost profits, which unnecessarily added significant complexity to the case.\"1068\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 33-38.\n\n500.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the general presumption that costs follow the event has been supported by investment treaty tribunals, including numerous NAFTA tribunals, which have held that the prevailing party in an arbitration should be awarded its arbitration costs in whole or in part.1069 In addition to arguing that the Claimant knew or ought to have known its claims are without merit, the Respondent also claims that the Claimant: (i) fried \"irrelevant\" expert reports, (ii) made \"unnecessary and improper\" procedural motions and (iii) presented an \"incoherent\" damages case based on an \"inappropriate valuation methodology\" and an \"insufficient\" evidentiary record to meet its burden of proof.1070\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Costs Submissions,** para. 8 (referring to *EDF (Services) Limited v.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant fails to offer a compelling reason or supportive arbitral decisions to justify such a departure from the general principle of costs following the event.1071\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Reply Costs Submissions,** paras. 3-6. The Respondent argues that the *Mondev* decision, cited by the Claimant, does not support the Claimant\u2019s position; **Respondent\u2019s Reply Costs Submissions,** para. 4 (referring to *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States ofAmerica* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award of 11 October 2002 **(CL-66),** para. 159).\n\n502.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that even if the Claimant is partially successful, it should be required to bear the Respondent\u2019s costs for its unsuccessful claims. Referring to academic commentary and the decision in *European American Investment Bank* in support of its position, the Respondent states that the principle that costs follow the event must be \"based on an assessment of relative success rather than simply on which party won the case.\"1072 In this regard the Respondent argues that the Claimant inappropriately advanced and maintained (i) jurisdictional arguments relating to the OPA,1073 (ii) claims regarding alleged breaches of Article 1102 and 11031074 and (iii) a damages claim that was \"incoherent and based on an inappropriate valuation methodology and insufficient evidentiary record.\"1075\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 12-14 (referring to Kinnear, Meg, Bjorklund, Andrea and Hannaford, John, *Investment Disputes under NAFTA: An Annotated Guide to NAFTA Chapter 11* (2006) **(RL-104),** Article 1135, p. 33; *European American Investment Bank AG (Austria) v.

The Respondent submits that the **PSEG** case is inapposite authority because the tribunal had only taken the approach it did because the case involved a denial of justice - according to the Respondent there is no denial of justice in the present dispute.1076\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Reply Costs Submissions,** paras. 6-7 (referring to *PSEG Global Inc. and Konya Ilgin Elektrik \u00dcretim ve Ticaret Limited Sirketi v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5), Award of 19 January 2007 **(CL-76),** paras. 247-249, 352).\n\n504.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent submits that even if the Tribunal holds that the Claimant is successful on all of its claims, the Tribunal should exercise its discretion and determine that each party should bear its own arbitration and legal costs \"because of the inefficient manner in which the Claimant presented its case.\"1077 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimant filed expert reports that were \"irrelevant\" or \"unnecessary\" to establish its claims.1078 The Respondent also considers that the Claimant\u2019s continued requests for information, including information outside ofthe Respondent\u2019s care, custody and control, were \"improper.\"1079\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Costs Submissions,** para. 25.\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 26-30. The Respondent considers the expert reports from Compass Renewable Energy Consulting, Advisory, and Professor Rudolph Dolzer, were \"unnecessary to establish the alleged NAFTA breaches.\"\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Costs Submissions,** paras. 31-32.\n\n505.\n\nEven if an award of costs for the Claimant could be justified, the Respondent contends that the Claimant\u2019s claimed costs are unreasonable. The Respondent describes the Claimant\u2019s costs as being \"caused by its own litigation strategy\" rather than the Respondent\u2019s actions. With respect to the document production criticism levelled by the Claimant, the Respondent notes that the Tribunal has already ruled that the Respondent\u2019s document production efforts were \"satisfactory.\" The Respondent further denies that late production by the Respondent had any cost impact on the Claimant and argues that its motion to strike portions of the record based on parliamentary privilege has no bearing on costs.1080\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Reply Costs Submissions,** paras. 9-15.\n\n506.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimant seeks to recover certain illegitimate amounts that are not included in the definition of costs set out in Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules, specifically the costs for Mr Baines, Mr Mars and Mr Ziegler to attend the hearing on days other than when they provided testimony, as well as the costs associated with its requests made under the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.1081\n\n**Respondent\u2019s Reply Costs Submissions,** paras. 16-17.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n507.\n\nArticle 1135(1) of NAFTA. provides that a \"tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.\" In the present case, the relevant provisions are Articles 40 and 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules. Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides:\n\n\"1. The arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award and, if it deems appropriate, in another decision.\n\n2. The term \u2018costs\u2019 includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 41;\n\n(b) The reasonable travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The reasonable costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The reasonable travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The legal and other costs incurred by the parties in relation to the arbitration to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the fees and expenses of the Secretary-General of the PCA.\"\n\n508.\n\nArticle 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules further provides:\n\n1. \"The costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party or parties. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. The arbitral tribunal shall in the final award or, if it deems appropriate, in any other award, determine any amount that a party may have to pay to another party as a result of the decision on allocation of costs.\"\n\n509.\n\nPursuant to Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in the final award. Both Parties have made advances in the amount of CAD 650,000, which amount in total to CAD 1,300,000 (equivalent to EUR 871,010.12 as converted to Euros upon receipt by the PCA).\n\n510.\n\nAs to Articles 40(2)(a), (b), (c), and (f), according to Section 19.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, each member of the Tribunal received a fee of USD 3,000 for each day of participation in meetings of the Tribunal or eight hours of other work performed in connection with the proceeding pro rata, as well as subsistence allowances and reimbursement of travel and other expenses within the limits set forth in Regulation 14 ofthe International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") Administrative and Financial Regulations and the Memorandum on the Fees and Expenses of ICSID Arbitrators. Based on these rates and converted to Euros upon payment by the PCA, the fees of the members of the Tribunal amount to EUR 93,274.79 for Mr R. Doak Bishop, EUR 155,618.23 to Dr Bernardo Cremades and EUR 191,024.76 to Dr Veijo Heiskanen. The travel and other expenses of the Tribunal amount to EUR 54,393.81. The PCA\u2019s fees and expenses for registry services, which were paid in accordance with the PCA\u2019s Schedule of Fees, amount to EUR 112,806.65. Other costs incurred (including costs of court reporting, IT/AV support, catering, courier services, hearing venue services, office supplies and printing, telecommunications, and banking services) amount to EUR 203,648.31. No fees or expenses of an appointing authority were claimed by the Parties.\n\n511.\n\nAccordingly the total costs of the arbitration (excluding the legal and other costs incurred by the Parties under Articles 40(2)(d) and (e)) amount to EUR 810,766.55. The PCA will provide the Parties with a statement of account after the issuance of this award and will return the unused balance to the Parties in equal shares.\n\n512.\n\nArticle 42 of the UNCITRAL Rules establishes that \"[t]he cost of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party.\" The Parties agree with this principle, although the Respondent also argues that, in the event the Claimant is successful on all of its claims, the Parties should be ordered to bear their own costs, due to the Claimant\u2019s allegedly inefficient conduct of the arbitration.\n\n513.\n\nHaving considered the applicable legal framework and the Parties\u2019 positions, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that each Party bear its share of the above-listed arbitration costs, i.e., the costs and fees of the Tribunal, the costs and fees of the PCA, and other costs incurred in relation to the arbitration. These costs effectively arise out of the Parties\u2019 arbitration agreement and thus constitute costs that both Parties have agreed to bear, and it cannot be said that either Party or their counsel has acted in the context of this arbitration in a manner that would have resulted in unnecessary or unreasonable additional costs. On the contrary, the Tribunal appreciates the highly professional and constructive manner in which the Parties and their counsel have conducted this arbitration.\n\n514.\n\nAs to the legal and other costs incurred by the Parties under Articles 40(2)(d) and (e), the Tribunal considers it appropriate to apportion these costs in accordance with the cost follows the event principle, on which both Parties agree. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has prevailed in this arbitration, and although only one of its four claims was granted, this was one of its two principal claims. However, the Tribunal did not accept the Claimant\u2019s principal method of valuation, to which much of the evidence, in particular expert evidence related, and on which much of the time at the hearing was spent. In the circumstances, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that the Respondent be ordered to reimburse the Claimant 50% of its legal and other costs, i.e., CAD 2,912,432. This amount is payable within 30 days of the notification of this award.\n\n**VIII.
