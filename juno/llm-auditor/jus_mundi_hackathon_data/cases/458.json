Procedural  History**\n----------------------------\n\n9.\n\nClaimants began mining precious metals in El Salvador in 1968. Between 1987 and early 2006, Claimants expanded their mining and related activities which were regulated by exploration licenses and environmental permits granted by the Government of El Salvador. However, in September/October 2006, the Government revoked Claimants\u2019 environmental permits and did not renew their exploration licenses.\n\n10.\n\nClaimants assert that these measures amount to a violation of Respondent\u2019s obligations under the Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (hereinafter \"CAFTA\"1), ratified in El Salvador on 17 December 2004 (effective as of 1 March 2006) and ratified in the United States on 27 July 2005 (effective as of 1 March 2006).\n\nThis Agreement is referenced as DR-CAFTA-US, CAFTA-DR, US-DR-CAFTA, etc., in various texts. For ease of reference, it will remain CAFTA throughout this Award.\n\n11.\n\nCAFTA contains the following arbitration provision:\n\n*Article 10.16*\n\nSubmission of a Claim to Arbitration\n\n1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:\n\n(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement; and\n\n(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and\n\n(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement; and\n\n(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n2. At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under this Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration (\"notice of intent\"). [...]\n\n3. Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise to the claim, a claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph 1:\n\n(a) under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedures for Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and the Party of the claimant are parties to the ICSID Convention;\n\n(b) under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either the respondent or the Party of the claimant is a party to the ICSID Convention; or\n\n(c) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n4. A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section when the claimant\u2019s notice of or request for arbitration (\"notice of arbitration\"):\n\n(a) referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 36 of the ICSID Convention is received by the Secretary-General;\n\n(b) referred to in Article 2 of Schedule C of the ICSID Additional Facility Rules is received by the Secretary-General; or\n\n(c) referred to in Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, together with the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, are received by the respondent.\n\nA claim asserted for the first time after such notice of arbitration is submitted shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section on the date of its receipt under the applicable arbitral rules.\n\n5. The arbitration rules applicable under paragraph 3, and in effect on the date the claim or claims were submitted to arbitration under this Section, shall govern the arbitration except to the extent modified by this Agreement.\n\n6. The claimant shall provide with the notice of arbitration:\n\n(a) the name of the arbitrator that the claimant appoints; or\n\n(b) the claimant\u2019s written consent for the Secretary-General to appoint such arbitrator.\n\n12.\n\nOn 17 March 2009, Claimants served on El Salvador a written notice of their intent to submit a claim to arbitration pursuant to Article 10.16.2 of CAFTA (the \"Notice of Intent\").\n\n13.\n\nPursuant to Articles 10.16.3 and 10.16.4 of CAFTA, Claimants had the right, six months after serving their Notice of Intent, to file a Notice of Arbitration either under the ICSID Convention or the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n14.\n\nOn 2 July 2009, Claimants filed their Notice of Arbitration with ICSID, accompanied by Annexes A through D (the \"Request\").\n\n15.\n\nThe Request states that it is made pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, Articles 10.16(1)(a), 10.16(1)(b) and 10.16(3)(a) of CAFTA (quoted at \u00b6 11 above), and Article 15(a) of the Ley de Inversiones of El Salvador (\"Investment Law\"). Article 15(a) of the Investment Law provides:\n\nEn caso que surgieren controversias o diferencias entre los inversionistas nacionales o extranjeros y el Estado, referentes a inversiones de aquellos, efectuadas en El Salvador, las partes podr\u00e1n acudir a los Tribunales de Justicia, competentes, de acuerdo a los procedimientos legales.\n\nEn el caso de controversias surgidas entre inversionistas extranjeros y el Estado, referentes a inversiones de aquellos efectuadas en El Salvador, los inversionistas podr\u00e1n remitir la controversia:\n\na) Al Centro Internacional de Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones (CIADI), con el objeto de resolver la controversia mediante conciliaci\u00f3n y arbitraje, de conformidad con el Convenio sobre Arreglo de Diferencias Relativas a Inversiones entre Estados y Nacionales de otros Estados (Convenio del CIADI);\n\n[Tribunal\u2019s translation:\n\nIn case of disputes arising between domestic or foreign investors and\n\nthe State, regarding their investments made in El Salvador, the parties may resort to [El Salvador\u2019s] Courts of Justice as the competent authority under the legal procedures.\n\nIn case of disputes arising between foreign investors and the State, regarding their investments made in El Salvador, the investors may submit the controversy to:\n\na) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), in order to settle the dispute by conciliation and arbitration, in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the ICSID Convention).]\n\n16.\n\nWithin their Request, Claimants included the following waiver of rights, as required by Article 10.18.2(b)(ii) of CAFTA (the \"Waiver Provision\"):2\n\n[T]he claimants hereby waive their rights to initiate or continue any domestic proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach for purposes of the present Notice of Arbitration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to Article 10.18.3 of CAFTA, the claimants reserve the right to initiate or continue any proceedings for injunctive relief not involving the payment of damages before any administrative or judicial tribunal of the Republic of El Salvador, for the purposes of preserving their rights and interests during the pendency of this arbitration. Copies of the waivers are attached as Exhibit \"A\" and Exhibit \"B\".\n\nRequest \u00b6 36.  \n Article 10.18.2 of CAFTA provides:  \n No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this section unless:  \n (a) the claimant consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and  \n (b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,  \n (i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant\u2019s written waiver, and  \n (ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the claimant\u2019s and the enterprise\u2019s written waivers  \n of any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\n\n17.\n\nOn 29 July 2009, the Secretary-General of ICSID (the \"Secretary-General\") requested Claimants to submit additional information for purposes of determining whether their Request was \"manifestly outside the jurisdiction of the Centre\" pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention (the \"Clarification\").\n\n18.\n\nOn 14 August 2009, Respondent filed a letter in which it submitted that the present dispute \"is manifestly outside ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction\", contending, among other things, that Claimants had not stopped court proceedings extent in El Salvador in which they sought to obtain the complete reversal of any measures taken against them, thereby violating the mandatory Waiver Provision of CAFTA.\n\n19.\n\nOn 19 August 2009, Claimants submitted their Clarification, providing supplemental Annexes E, F, and G to the Request.\n\n20.\n\nOn 21 August 2009, the Secretary-General registered Claimants\u2019 Request with Annexes A through G.\n\n21.\n\nOn 24 August 2009, Respondent filed a letter preserving its objections made in its letter of 14 August 2009.\n\n22.\n\nOn 29 October 2009, ICSID confirmed the appointment of Dr. Horacio A. Grigera Na\u00f3n to serve as the arbitrator nominated by Claimants.\n\n23.\n\nThereafter, this matter remained at a standstill for many months.\n\n24.\n\nOn 9 April 2010, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that failure to take action during six consecutive months would lead to a discontinuance of proceedings pursuant to Rule 45 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n25.\n\nOn 13 April 2010, Claimants filed a letter with ICSID, requesting that the Chairman of the Administrative Council immediately appoint an arbitrator on behalf of Respondent, as Respondent had failed to appoint an arbitrator.\n\n26.\n\nBefore such action from ICSID became necessary, on 28 April 2010, Respondent appointed Mr. J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C., to serve as co-arbitrator.\n\n27.\n\nOn 11 May 2010, the Secretary-General informed the Parties of the need to appoint a presiding arbitrator.\n\n28.\n\nThe Parties having been unable to agree on a presiding arbitrator, by letter dated 29 June 2010, the Secretary-General of ICSID advised that she had appointed Prof. van den Berg pursuant to Article 10.19.3 of CAFTA.\n\n29.\n\nOn the same day (29 June 2010), Prof. van den Berg accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal, pursuant to Rule 5 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n30.\n\nOn 1 July 2010, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Tribunal was deemed constituted and that the proceedings had begun. Further, the Parties and the Tribunal were informed that Mr. Marco T. Monta\u00f1\u00e9s-Rumayor, Counsel at ICSID, would serve as the Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n31.\n\nOn 27 July 2010, the First Session was held by telephone at which a procedural calendar for the further conduct of the proceedings was established. During the First Session, it was agreed that the arbitration would be bifurcated between a jurisdictional and a merits phase.\n\n32.\n\nOn 13 August 2010, the Parties jointly filed a letter evincing their agreement as to the procedural timetable.\n\n33.\n\nIn accordance with this timetable, on 16 August 2010, Respondent filed its Preliminary Objections under the expedited procedures of CAFTA (the \"PO\"). On the same date, the Tribunal suspended the proceeding on the merits.\n\n34.\n\nThe relevant provisions regarding the expedited procedures of CAFTA are contained in Article 10.20, captioned \"Conduct of the Arbitration\", and provide as follows:\n\n4. Without prejudice to a tribunal\u2019s authority to address other objections as a preliminary question, a tribunal shall address and decide as a preliminary question any objection by the respondent that, as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made under Article 10.26.\n\n(a) Such objection shall be submitted to the tribunal as soon as possible after the tribunal is constituted, and in no event later than the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its counter-memorial (or, in the case of an amendment to the notice of arbitration, the date the tribunal fixes for the respondent to submit its response to the amendment).\n\n(b) On receipt of an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits, establish a schedule for considering the objection consistent with any schedule it has established for considering any other preliminary question, and issue a decision or award on the objection, stating the grounds therefor.\n\n(c) In deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant\u2019s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or any amendment thereof) and, in disputes brought under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.\n\n(d) The respondent does not waive any objection as to competence or any argument on the merits merely because the respondent did or did not raise an objection under this paragraph or make use of the expedited procedure set out in paragraph 5.\n\n5. In the event that the respondent so requests within 45 days after the tribunal is constituted, the tribunal shall decide on an expedited basis an objection under paragraph 4 and any objection that the dispute is not within the tribunal\u2019s competence. The tribunal shall suspend any proceedings on the merits and issue a decision or award on the objection(s), stating the grounds therefor, no later than 150 days after the date of the request. However, if a disputing party requests a hearing, the tribunal may take an additional 30 days to issue the decision or award. Regardless of whether a hearing is requested, a tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.\n\n6. When it decides a respondent\u2019s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant\u2019s claim or the respondent\u2019s objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.\n\n35.\n\nOn 15 September 2010, Claimants filed their Response to El Salvador\u2019s Preliminary Objections (the \"PO Response\").\n\n36.\n\nOn 30 September 2010, Respondent filed its Reply to Claimants\u2019 PO Response (the \"PO Reply\").\n\n37.\n\nOn 7 October 2010, Respondent filed a letter requesting the Tribunal to hold a hearing to address its PO pursuant to Article 10.20.5 of CAFTA.\n\n38.\n\nOn 15 October 2010, Claimants filed their Statement of Rejoinder to the PO Reply (the \"PO Rejoinder\").\n\n39.\n\nOn 20 October 2010, the Tribunal issued Order No. 1, addressing the procedure and timeline for *amicus curiae* submissions pursuant to Article 10.20.3 of CAFTA (\"[t]he tribunal shall have the authority to accept and consider *amicus curiae* submissions from a person or entity that is not a disputing party\") and Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (\"the Tribunal may allow a person or entity that is not a party to the dispute [...] to file a written submission with the Tribunal\").\n\n40.\n\nIn response to Order No. 1, (i) Costa Rica filed a submission on 1 November 2010; (ii) Nicaragua filed a submission on 1 November 2010; and (iii) the United States filed a letter on 1 November 2010, informing the Tribunal that it would not make a submission.\n\n41.\n\nOn 9 November 2010, the Tribunal informed the Parties of the agenda for the hearing to address Respondent\u2019s PO (the \"Hearing\") and invited the Parties to respond to the following two-part question (the \"Pre-Hearing Question\"):\n\n(i) Can a party discontinue proceedings before the Supreme Court of El Salvador when they are in a deliberation phase?\n\n(ii) If so, what are the steps to be taken and what are the relevant statutory provisions?\n\n42.\n\nOn 10 November 2010, Respondent requested that the Tribunal admit the registration of Claimants\u2019 joint venture3 in the Commercial Registry of El Salvador (the \"Official JV Registration\") into the record.\n\n*See* \u00b6 56 below.\n\n43.\n\nOn 11 November 2010, the Tribunal admitted the Official JV Registration into the record.\n\n44.\n\nOn 12 November 2010, Respondent filed its response to the Pre-Hearing Question with the Secretary of the Tribunal (the \"Pre-Hearing Response\").\n\n45.\n\nOn the same day, Claimants filed a letter with the Tribunal, submitting that \"although we have been addressing these questions, we are unable at this time to furnish the tribunal with our answer.\"\n\n46.\n\nOn 14 November 2010, Respondent filed two additional documents, which the Tribunal admitted into the record as supplemental attachments to its letter of 12 November 2010.\n\n47.\n\nThe Hearing to address Respondent\u2019 s PO was held in Washington, D.C., on 15 November 2010.4 The following representatives attended the hearing:\n\na) on behalf of Claimants: Messrs. John Machulak, James Machulak, Eugene Bykhovsky, and Prof. Andrew Newcombe;\n\nb) on behalf of Respondent: Messrs.

The Tribunal may, on a showing of extraordinary cause, delay issuing its decision or award by an additional brief period, which may not exceed 30 days.\n\n54.\n\nIn this Award, the Tribunal adopts the following method of citation:\n\n\u2022 \"Request\" refers to the Notice of Arbitration filed by Claimants on 2 July 2009;\n\n\u2022 \"Notice of Registration\" refers to the Notice of Registration registered by the ICSID on 21 August 2009;\n\n\u2022 \"PO\" refers to Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections filed on 16 August 2010;\n\n\u2022 \"PO Response\" refers to Claimant\u2019s Response to the Preliminary Objections filed on 15 September 2010;\n\n\u2022 \"PO Reply\" refers to Respondent\u2019s Statement of Reply to the PO Response filed on 30 September 2010;\n\n\u2022 \"PO Rejoinder\" refers to the Statement of Rejoinder filed by Claimants on 15 October 2010; and\n\n\u2022 \"Tr.\" refers to the English transcript made of the Hearing on 15 November 2010 (Tr. 1 means Transcript on page 1).\n\n**IV. Factual  Background**\n---------------------------\n\n55.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that, in accordance with Article 10.20.4(c) of CAFTA, when deciding on Respondent\u2019s PO, \"the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant\u2019s factual allegations in support of any claim\" in the Request. In light of this, the Tribunal does not purport to make any findings of fact in this Section, but rather sets out what it understands to be this matter\u2019s factual background in light of the factual allegations in the Request, which the Tribunal assumes to be true in this phase of the proceedings.\n\n56.\n\nOn 22 September 1987, CGC and SSGM entered into a joint venture registered in Wisconsin, U.S.A, to explore, develop, mine and produce precious metals in El Salvador (the \"Commerce/Sanseb Joint Venture\").9\n\nRequest \u00b6 7.\n\n57.\n\nCGC owns 82.5% of the authorized and issued stock of SSGM. CGC also owns 52% of the authorized and issued common shares in Mineral San Sebastian, S.A. de C.V. (the \"Minsane\"), an El Salvadoran corporation formed on 8 May 1960.10\n\nRequest \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8.\n\n58.\n\nClaimants received an exploitation concession from the Government of El Salvador for the San Sebastian Gold Mine on 23 July 1987. At this time, Claimants and Minsane entered into an agreement to lease 305-acres at the San Sebastian Gold Mine (the \"Minsane Agreement\"). Later, in 1993, Claimants acquired two additional properties, the El Modesto Mine and the San Crist\u00f3bal Mill and Plant.11\n\nRequest \u00b6 15.\n\n59.\n\nOn 18 August 2002, Claimants met with the El Salvadoran Minister of Economy and the Department of Hydrocarbons and Mines to cancel their exploitation concession license for the San Sebastian Gold Mine in exchange for another 12 exploitation license, to last for 20 to 30 years.12\n\nRequest \u00b6\u00b6 15-18; PO \u00b6 106.\n\n60.\n\nIn order to mine and process gold ore at the San Sebastian Mine and San Crist\u00f3bal Mill and Plant, Claimants received environmental permits from the El Salvador Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (the \"MARN\") on 20 October 2002 and 15 October 2002, respectively, renewed for a 3-year period as of 4 January 2006.13\n\nRequest \u00b6 16.\n\n61.\n\nIn addition, El Salvador granted Claimants two further exploration licenses, namely: (i) on 3 March 2003, encompassing the San Sebastian Mine and adjoining areas (the \"New San Sebastian Exploration License\"); and (ii) on 25 May 2004, encompassing eight former gold and silver mines (the \"Nueva Esparta Exploration License\").14\n\nRequest \u00b6\u00b6 18-19; PO \u00b6 106.\n\n62.\n\nOn 13 September 2006, MARN revoked the environmental permits of the San Sebastian Gold Mine and the San Crist\u00f3bal Plant and Mine, thereby effectively terminating Claimants\u2019 right to mine and process gold and silver.15\n\nRequest \u00b6 21.\n\n63.\n\nIn response, on 6 December 2006, counsel for Commerce and SanSeb filed two petitions with El Salvador\u2019s Court of Administrative Litigation of the Supreme Court of Justice, one for each affected mine, seeking a review of the Ministry of the Environment\u2019s revocation of the environmental permits and their reinstatement.16\n\nRequest \u00b6 22.\n\n64.\n\nOn 29 April 2010, El Salvador\u2019s Court of Administrative Litigation of the Supreme Court of Justice notified its decisions of 18 March 2010 (Case No. 3082006) and 28 April 2010 (Case No. 309-2006) with respect to these two complaints.17\n\nTr. 164-166; R-5; R-6.\n\n65.\n\nIn the interim, over the course of 2006 and 2007, Commerce/Sanseb applied to MARN for an environmental permit for the New San Sebastian Exploration License and the Nueva Esparta exploration license, and then to Respondent\u2019s Ministry of Economy for the extension of the exploration licenses.18 The requested environmental permits were not granted, and on 28 October 2008, El Salvador\u2019s Ministry of Economy denied Commerce/Sanseb\u2019s application citing Commerce/Sanseb\u2019s failure to secure an environment permit.19\n\nRequest \u00b6 23.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 23; PO \u00b6 106.\n\n**V. **S**ummary of the Parties' Positions and Relief Sought**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n66.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear this dispute because Claimants did not comply with the CAFTA Waiver Provision by allowing the extant court proceedings which they had initiated in El Salvador to continue. In Respondent\u2019s view, adherence to the Waiver Provision is a condition precedent to Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitration under both CAFTA and the ICSID Convention, and Claimants\u2019 failure to remedy their non-compliance with the Waiver Provision once they were put on notice by Respondent means that Claimants have not preserved their claims in a timely fashion. For this reason, Respondent requests that the Tribunal:20\n\n\u2022 Suspend the proceedings on the merits while this Preliminary Objection is pending.\n\n\u2022 Dismiss this arbitration in its entirety.\n\n\u2022 Issue an order awarding the Republic of El Salvador its share of the arbitration costs and its attorney\u2019s fees incurred related to this Objection, plus interest from the time of the decision until payment is made, at a rate to be established at the appropriate time.\n\n\u2022 Grant the Republic any other remedy that the Tribunal may consider proper.\n\nPO \u00b6 126, \"reaffirm[ed]\" in PO Reply \u00b6 137.\n\n**B. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n67.\n\nClaimants consider that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this dispute because they have complied fully with the Waiver Provision. Claimants submit that the waiver provided in the Request serves as \"a unilateral and final abandonment, extinguishment, and abdication of Claimants\u2019 legal rights to initiate or continue other proceedings\" with regard to the claims before the Tribunal.21 Claimants further submit that CAFTA does not require immediate discontinuance of domestic proceedings, but rather, allows Respondent to use Claimants\u2019 waiver to seek the discontinuance of domestic proceedings if it so desires. Based on the foregoing, Claimants request that this Tribunal:22\n\n(1) reject the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection;\n\n(2) award the Claimants their costs in opposing the Preliminary Objection, including counsel fees and disbursements, and the arbitration costs associated with the Preliminary Objection, with compound interest;\n\n(3) resume the proceedings on the merits and, after consultation with the parties, establish a schedule for the written and oral phase of the merits of the proceeding; and\n\n(4) grant such other relief as the Tribunal may consider appropriate.\n\nPO Response \u00b6 53.\n\nPO Response \u00b6 101; PO Rejoinder \u00b6 107.\n\n**VI. Introduction to the  Tribunal\u2019 s Analysis**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the written and oral pleadings, evidence and legal authorities submitted by the Parties and has relied exclusively on those in the analysis below. To the extent arguments raised by the Parties are not referred to expressly in this Award, they must be deemed to be subsumed in the analysis. By contrast, the Tribunal will not address arguments that have not been raised by the Parties, as this Award is a decision only in the dispute as pleaded between them.\n\n**VII. Jurisdiction**\n---------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 dispute revolves around the CAFTA Waiver Provision, which provides as follows:\n\n**Article 10.18: Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party**\n\n1. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.\n\n2. No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless:\n\n(a) the claimant consents in writing to arbitration in accordance with the procedures set out in this Agreement; and\n\n(b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied,\n\n(i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant\u2019s written waiver, and\n\n(ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the claimant\u2019s and the enterprise\u2019s written waivers\n\nof any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\n\n3. Notwithstanding paragraph 2(b), the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) and the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) may initiate or continue an action that seeks interim injunctive relief and does not involve the payment of monetary damages before a judicial or administrative tribunal of the respondent, provided that the action is brought for the sole purpose of preserving the claimant\u2019s or the enterprise\u2019s rights and interests during the pendency of the arbitration.\n\n4. No claim may be submitted to arbitration:\n\n(a) for breach of an investment authorization under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(B) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B), or 10-14\n\n(b) for breach of an investment agreement under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C), if the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has previously submitted the same alleged breach to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure, for adjudication or resolution.\n\n**A. What Does the Waiver Provision require?**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Parties' Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n70.\n\nRespondent contends that the Tribunal has neither jurisdiction nor competence to decide Claimants\u2019 claims because Claimants failed to comply with the Waiver Provision in not providing and acting consistently with the relinquishment of their right to continue domestic court proceedings in favor of CAFTA arbitration.23\n\nPO Response \u00b6\u00b6 77-80.\n\n71.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, the Waiver Provision places two requirements on Claimants, namely, (i) a \"form\" requirement, whereby Claimants must in fact submit a waiver, and (ii) a \"material\" requirement, whereby Claimants must abide by such waiver by discontinuing domestic court proceedings before initiating this CAFTA arbitration.24\n\nPO \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, 45; Tr. 69-70.\n\n72.\n\nRespondent contends that to interpret Claimants\u2019 waiver in good faith requires Claimants, as the investors seeking to benefit from CAFTA, to take steps to comply with the Waiver Provision even after filing for arbitration. By not doing so, Claimants have not met their burden of perfecting Respondent\u2019s \"conditional consent\" to arbitrate under CAFTA and therefore Respondent has not consented to arbitrate this dispute.25\n\nPO \u00b6 37.\n\n73.\n\nClaimants disagree and argue that the Waiver Provision only requires delivery of a signed waiver to Respondent - which they did with the Request - and that it then falls within Respondent\u2019s discretion to seek discontinuance of the domestic court proceedings.26\n\nPO \u00b6\u00b6 30, 44.\n\n74.\n\nIn this respect, Claimants state that \"CAFTA\u2019 s drafters could have required the discontinuance of domestic proceedings as a condition precedent to the submission of a claim\", but instead, \"they required a waiver of the rights to continue the proceedings\"27, which allows a respondent state a \"sovereign choice\" whether it prefers \"concurrent proceedings to continue\"28.\n\nPO \u00b6 43.\n\nPO \u00b6 23.\n\n75.\n\nClaimants also submit that they were under no obligation to put an end to the court proceedings after the start of the arbitration, arguing that events that occur after receipt of the Request by the Secretary-General are \"irrelevant\" and have no bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.29\n\nSoRj \u00b6 10.\n\n76.\n\nRespondent rebuts Claimants\u2019 position, contending that Claimants seek to \"impose the burden on the respondent State to seek enforcement of the waiver\" instead of \"accepting that a claimant is required to make its waiver effective by discontinuing 30 any parallel proceedings\".30 Respondent submits that Claimants \"had within their full power the ability to comply\".31\n\nPO Reply \u00b6 34.\n\nTr. 71.\n\n77.\n\nMoreover, Respondent submits that it would have been \"sufficient\" for Claimants to file their discontinuance application with the Supreme Court, where, pursuant to Salvadoran law, \"discontinuance is automatic when claimant is in an administrative case.\"32\n\nTr. 42.\n\n78.\n\nRespondent concludes that where Claimants were in a position to discontinue domestic proceedings, they were correspondingly in a position to comply with the Waiver Provision at the time of filing, and that \"[i]t is a matter of good faith to comply with the waiver and not to say, I filed my waiver and someday I will discontinue... the waiver had to be valid when filed.\"33\n\nTr. 72.\n\n*(b) The Tribunal's Analysis*\n-----------------------------\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Respondent has put forth the argument that any waiver must comply with both a formal and a material element. Claimant disagrees, essentially arguing that the Waiver Provision only requires adherence to written formalities.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Respondent. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, to understand the concept of waiver in any other way would render it devoid of meaning. Indeed, a waiver must be more than just words; it must accomplish its intended effect. In the case of CAFTA, this effect is to have Claimants relinquish \"any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach\" (*see* CAFTA 10.18(2)(b) in \u00b6 69 above).\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal is not alone in this view. For example, in its submission in these proceedings, the Republic of Costa Rica has stated that:34\n\nA Claimant complies with the requirement of [CAFTA] Article 10.18(2)(b) by physically submitting the waiver document accompanying his request for arbitration. [S]aid submission must also be accompanied by the effective waiver, withdrawal or discontinuance, as appropriate, of any and all proceedings, either court or administrative proceedings, pending when the arbitration is commenced and whose procedural drive lies with the claimant. Otherwise, this provision would be denied effectiveness or \"*effet utile*\".\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission of the Republic of Costa Rica, \u00b6 3.\n\n82.\n\nThe Republic of Nicaragua reiterated this point in its own submission:35\n\nIf an investor submits a written waiver under Article 10.18.2(i) and (ii), but fails to comply with such waiver, this conduct would be deemed as [misleading] within the scope of the general law and a violation to the rule within the scope of the DR-CAFTA Agreement. Therefore, the claim may not be submitted to arbitration.\n\nCommunication of the Republic of Nicaragua, \u00b6 12 (unofficial translation).\n\n83.\n\nOther tribunals have also seen things similarly. For instance, in *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/98/2, Arbitral Award, 2 June 2000, the tribunal decided that:36\n\nAny waiver [...] implies a formal and material act on the part of the person tendering same. To this end, this Tribunal will therefore have to ascertain whether [the claimant] did indeed submit the waiver in accordance with the formalities envisaged under NAFTA and whether it has respected the terms of the same through the material act of dropping or desisting from initiating parallel proceedings before other courts or tribunals.\n\nCL-7; RL-6.\n\n84.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Article 10.18(2)(b) of CAFTA requires Claimants to file a formal \"written waiver\", and then materially ensure that no other legal proceedings are \"initiated\" or \"continued\".\n\n85.\n\nAt this juncture, the Tribunal observes that, as Claimants would have it, the Waiver Provision requires only the delivery of a signed waiver to Respondent, and Respondent would have to seek discontinuance of the domestic court proceedings itself. In other words, Claimants consider that while the formal requirement may be Claimants\u2019 responsibility, the material element is Respondent\u2019s.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree. The Tribunal has been provided with no reason to conclude that the formal and material elements of the Waiver Provision should be divided between the Parties. In any event, logic tells us that it is up to Claimants to make the waiver of their legal rights effective, not Respondent.\n\n87.\n\nAccordingly, in the next Section, the Tribunal will determine whether Claimants have acted in accordance with the Waiver Provision\u2019s formal and material requirements.\n\n**B. Did Claimants Act in Violation of the Waiver Provision\u2019s Requirements?**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Parties' Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n88.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants were \"in patent violation\" of the Waiver Provision by continuing with their claims before the national courts, \"related to the same measures to maximize the probability of obtaining a favorable result\", when they filed their Request with ICSID in July 2009.37\n\nPO \u00b6 5.\n\n89.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants\u2019 violation turns upon the definition of \"measures\" within the Waiver Provision. Citing the decisions of tribunals in the *RDC*38, *Thunderbird*39, and *Loewen*40 cases, as well as Article 2.1 of CAFTA, captioned \"Definitions of General Application\", Respondent submits that the \"same measures\" challenged by the Claimants in the domestic judicial proceedings and this arbitration include the revocation of permits and similar quantification of monetary damages.41\n\n*Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23, Decision on Objection to Jurisdiction under CAFTA Article 10.20.5 (17 Nov. 2008).\n\n*See* *International Thunderbird Gaming Corporation v. The United Mexican States*, UNCITRAL, Arbitral Award (26 Jan. 2006).\n\n*The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. The United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/98/3, Decision on Hearing of Respondent\u2019s Objection to Competen ce and Jurisdiction (5 Jan. 2001).\n\nPO \u00b6\u00b6 32-38; PO Response \u00b6 76.\n\n90.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants\u2019 non-compliance with the Waiver Provision is evidenced by, among other things, a letter from El Salvador\u2019s Court of Administrative Litigation of the Supreme Court of Justice dated 1 October 2009, whereby the court notified Claimants that the domestic proceedings initiated by them were awaiting final decision.42\n\nR-16.\n\n91.\n\nIn response to the above, Claimants submit that Respondent\u2019s PO has no merit.\n\n92.\n\nFirst, Claimants contend that they complied with the Waiver Provision because, among other things, (i) their waivers comply with the provisions of CAFTA, (ii) their waivers resulted in the abandonment of Claimants\u2019 rights to pursue the domestic proceedings, and (iii) CAFTA does not require discontinuance of domestic proceedings as a condition to submitting a claim to arbitration.43 In this respect, Claimants submit that there is \"no question of a defect *ratione materiae* in the waivers\", seeing as they accurately reproduced the language of the Waiver Provision.44\n\nPO Response, \u00b6\u00b6 26-47.\n\nPO Response, \u00b6 38.\n\n93.\n\nSecond, Claimants contend that \"the fundamental point is that a waiver is a unilateral and final abandonment, extinguishment and abdication of legal rights\", rendering the fact that they took no steps to discontinue the domestic proceedings immaterial.45 In Claimants\u2019 view, what is relevant is that they have also taken no positive action to continue those proceedings and, therefore, have acted in accordance with the waiver.46\n\nPO Response \u00b6 17.\n\nPO Response \u00b6\u00b6 42-43, 53, 70; PO Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 36.\n\n94.\n\nThird, Claimants contend that there were no overlapping proceedings as between the El Salvador courts and this arbitration, contrary to the issue faced by the tribunal in *RDC.*47 Instead, citing the tribunal in *Vannessa Ventures*48, Claimants contend that courts in parallel domestic proceedings \"are in the best position to enforce the waiver\", as opposed to the arbitral tribunal seized.49 Further, Claimants argue that to the extent the question of the revocation of the environmental permits could be before the El Salvador courts and this Tribunal, their claim that El Salvador has imposed a *de facto* ban on gold and silver mining is not.50\n\n*Railroad Development Corporation v. Republic of Guatemala*, *supra* at note 38.\n\n*Vannessa Ventures Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)04/6, Decision on Jurisdiction (22 Aug. 2008).\n\nPO Response, \u00b6\u00b6 60-62.\n\nPO Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 85-91.\n\n*(b) The Tribunal's Analysis*\n-----------------------------\n\n95.\n\nIt appears that the Parties are on common ground that Claimants adhered to the formal requirement of the Waiver Provision. The only question, therefore, is whether Claimants also adhered to the material requirement.\n\n96.\n\nAs an initial matter, the Tribunal notes that the Parties agree that the relevant date for determining the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is 2 July 2009, *i.e.*, the date the Request was filed.51 However, Claimants submit that, for purposes of examining the waiver requirement, \"there were no arbitral proceedings in the present case until 1 July 2010\", the date on which the Tribunal was constituted.52\n\nTr. 61-62; PO Response, \u00b6 40.\n\nPO Response, \u00b6 69.\n\n97.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimants\u2019 position is inconsistent. Claimants cannot at once argue that 2 July 2009 is the relevant date for determining jurisdiction and 1 July 2010 for examining waiver, when the issue of waiver *is* a question of jurisdiction. Indeed, Claimants have admitted as much.53 Accordingly, the Tribunal will examine whether Claimants\u2019 behavior was in compliance with its waiver as of 2 July 2009.\n\nIn \u00b6 5 of the PO Rejoinder, Claimants \"accept that the submission of a waiver under CAFTA Article 10.18 is a condition and limitation on consent and thus a jurisdictional requirement\".\n\n98.\n\nRespondent is of the view that Claimants were not in compliance with the material waiver requirement because on the date they filed the Request, the same \"measures\" challenged in these proceedings were also before El Salvador\u2019s courts. Claimants disagree, arguing that there were never even overlapping proceedings.\n\n99.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that while Claimants contend that there were never any overlapping proceedings, Claimants argue this with reference to the date of the constitution of the Tribunal (**i.e.**, 1 July 2010) as opposed to the date of the Request (**i.e.**, 2 July 2009).54 Indeed, as of 1 July 2010, the proceedings before El Salvador\u2019s Court of Administrative Litigation of the Supreme Court of Justice had ended, with its decisions having been notified on 29 April 2010.\n\n*See generally* PO Response, \u00b6\u00b6 67-71.\n\n100.\n\nHowever, as the Tribunal decided in \u00b6 97 above, the operative date for examining the waiver is 2 July 2009. There is no dispute that, as of that date, the two complaints filed by Claimants were awaiting judgment by El Salvador\u2019s Court of Administrative Litigation of the Supreme Court of Justice (*see* \u00b6\u00b6 63 - 64 above).\n\n101.\n\nFurthermore, those complaints relate very much to the same \"measures\" as those at issue in these proceedings. The Article 10.18(2) waiver applies to proceedings \"with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach\" of CAFTA. The definition of \"measure\" in Article 2.1 of CAFTA \"includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice\". It is undisputed that the relevant \"measures\" in this case and the El Salvador proceedings are the revocation of the environmental permits *(see* \u00b6\u00b6 62 - 65 above).\n\n102.\n\nClaimants have indicated (as they must) that they were aware when they filed their Request that the proceedings which they had initiated in El Salvador were ongoing, but state further that they were unaware of the status of such proceedings because of communication difficulties with local counsel.55 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, this is no excuse. Regardless of the status of the El Salvador proceedings, Claimants knew the proceedings they had initiated and argued were pending a decision of the Court. Claimants were accordingly under an obligation to discontinue those proceedings in order to give material effect to their formal waiver. It was fleshed out in connection with the Pre-Hearing Question that discontinuing the proceedings would have been possible and relatively quick (*see* \u00b6\u00b6 48 - 49 above). In this respect, Claimants\u2019 argument that they acted in accordance with the waiver by not taking any positive action to continue those proceedings holds no weight, as the El Salvador proceedings continued with no positive action on Claimants\u2019 part to discontinue them, and ultimately resulted in two judgments.\n\nTr. 163.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that when El Salvador\u2019s Court of Administrative Litigation of the Supreme Court of Justice issued its judgments, it only named Claimant No. 1, omitting to mention Claimant No. 2.56 This is despite the fact that claims were filed on behalf of both Claimants in the proceedings in El Salvador.57 Respondent alleges that the Court\u2019 s decision came about due to confusion concerning the joint venture\u2019s name on the part of the Government of El Salvador (because of its denomination in the commercial registry as \"Commerce Group\", rather than \"Commerce/Sanseb Joint Venture\"), and not due to any affirmative action by Claimant No. 2 to discontinue its participation.58 Be it as it may, nothing in the record indicates any affirmative action by Claimant No. 2 to discontinue its participation in such proceedings. On the contrary, as is clear from Claimants\u2019 letter to the MARN dated 10 December 2009, both Claimants indicated that they were awaiting a decision from the El Salvador\u2019s courts.59 Further, the Tribunal notes Claimants\u2019 statement in its Request that Claimant No. 1 and Claimant No. 2 entered into a joint venture named the \"Commerce/Sanseb Joint Venture\" on September 22, 1988 and that the joint venture agreement authorizes Claimant No. 1 to execute agreements on behalf of the Joint Venture and that the \"Commerce/Sanseb Joint Venture is a \"national of another Contracting State\" for the purposes of the ICSID Convention.\" Thus, the Tribunal understands that Claimant No. 1 has been acting on behalf of Claimant No. 2 in this matter and in the domestic proceedings.\n\nR-5; R-6\n\nC-6; C-7.\n\nTr. 87-90.\n\nR-15.\n\n104.\n\nAt this juncture, the Tribunal must address the issue raised in connection with the Post-Hearing Question, namely, whether Claimants\u2019 discontinuing the proceedings before the El Salvador courts would have been with or without prejudice to the reintroduction of Claimants\u2019 cause of action elsewhere.\n\n105.\n\nIn response to the Post-Hearing Question, Respondent submitted a memorandum composed with input from local counsel, indicating that Claimants\u2019 discontinuing those proceedings would not result in their losing the right to pursue the underlying cause of action in another forum.60 For their part, Claimants submitted a letter, asserting that discontinuing proceedings would be with prejudice to reinstatement, \"based on the combined effect of Art. 53 of the Law of Administrative Litigation Jurisdiction and Articles 464 and 467 of the Civil Proceedings Code\".61\n\n*See* Respondent\u2019s letter dated 23 November 2010.\n\n*See* Claimants\u2019 letter dated 23 November 2010.\n\n106.\n\nClaimants have not provided the Tribunal with the text of the laws to which they refer, nor with an analysis of those laws. By contrast, Respondent\u2019s memorandum provides a thorough analysis of the Post-Hearing Question, with which the Tribunal agrees. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants\u2019 rights would not have been impinged upon by discontinuing the proceedings in El Salvador.\n\n107.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that Claimants were obliged to discontinue the proceedings before the El Salvador courts relating to the revocation of the environmental permits, and by not doing so, Claimants did not act in accordance with the requirements of the Waiver Provision.\n\n108.\n\nHowever, the foregoing does not dispose of the issue entirely. Indeed, the above only addresses the revocation of the environmental permits being before both this Tribunal and the courts of El Salvador. The above does not address Claimants\u2019 claim that a *de facto* ban imposed by El Salvador on gold and silver mining can still be heard in these proceedings because it is before this Tribunal only and not before the El Salvador courts (*see* \u00b6 94 above).62\n\nPO Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 80-83.\n\n109.\n\nRespondent denies that such a *de facto* ban exists or ever existed and, in any event, contends that such a policy cannot constitute a \"measure\" within the meaning of CAFTA. Rather, Respondent contends that the only \"measures\" underlying Claimants\u2019 allegations of breach of CAFTA are the revocation of the environmental permits.63\n\nPO, \u00b6 30-31.\n\n110.\n\nClaimants counter Respondent\u2019s argument with reference to the tribunal\u2019s decision in **RDC**. In Claimants\u2019 view, **RDC** stands for the proposition that a partial overlap of claims between a CAFTA arbitration and parallel proceedings cannot render a CAFTA waiver invalid in its entirety. Claimants consider that claims not heard in the parallel proceedings can still be heard in the CAFTA arbitration. In light of this, Claimants submit that, as the *de facto* ban claim is not before the El Salvador courts, their waiver is valid and that claim can be heard before this Tribunal.64\n\nPO Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 85-91.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal does not disagree with Claimants\u2019 reading of the decision in **RDC**. However, the Tribunal considers reference to **RDC** in the context of this case to be inapposite, as the Tribunal has not been confronted with separate and distinct claims. The Tribunal views Claimants\u2019 claim regarding the ***de facto*** mining ban policy as part and parcel of their claim regarding the revocation of the environmental permits. Indeed, when Claimants sought to challenge the revocation of the environmental permits before the El Salvador courts, they were not just hoping to have their permits reinstated - they were hoping to be able to mine again. The effect of the revocations, now upheld in Respondent\u2019s courts, was, to use Claimants\u2019 phrasing in their Notice of Arbitration, to \"effectively terminat[e] Commerce/SanSeb\u2019s right to mine and process gold and silver.\"65 The ***de facto*** mining policy was alleged to have emerged in the same month as the permit revocations were notified to Claimants.66 Consequently, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the ***de facto*** mining ban policy claim is not separate and distinct.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 21.\n\nRequest, \u00b6 25. In fact, the orders of revocation preceded their notification to Commerce/Sanseb by some two months.\n\n112.\n\nMoreover, even if the *de facto* mining ban policy and the revocation of the permits could be teased apart, the Tribunal is of the view that the policy does not constitute a \"measure\" within the meaning of CAFTA. At most - at least based on the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of this particular case - the ban is a policy of the Government as opposed to a \"measure\" taken by it. By contrast, the revocation of the environmental permits squarely constitutes a measure taken pursuant to that policy and, as noted, it was that revocation which put an end to Claimants\u2019 mining and processing activities.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore determines that Claimants failed to fulfill the requirements of the Waiver Provision with respect to their entire claims.\n\n**C. Consequences of the Failure to Fulfill the Waiver Requirement**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nArticle 10.18 is clear in relevant part: \"No claim may be submitted to arbitration... unless... (b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied... (i) by the claimant\u2019s written waiver... of any right to initiate or to continue... any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.\"\n\n115.\n\nAs analyzed above, the waiver is required as a condition to Respondent\u2019s consent to CAFTA. As also analyzed above, the waiver is invalid as it lacks effectiveness due to Claimants\u2019 failure to discontinue the proceedings before El Salvador\u2019s Court of Administrative Litigation of the Supreme Court. If the waiver is invalid, there is no consent. The Tribunal, therefore, does not have jurisdiction over the Parties\u2019 CAFTA dispute.\n\n116.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that Claimants have argued that their conduct following the submission of the waiver is irrelevant to the determination of jurisdiction and is rather subject to the Tribunal\u2019s \"supervisory power\" over the admissibility of the claims.67 However, as the Tribunal has already determined that it does not have jurisdiction over the Parties\u2019 CAFTA dispute on the basis of Claimants\u2019 behavior at the time the waiver was given, questions regarding admissibility of claims subsequent to the waiver fall away.\n\nPO Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 46-58\n\n117.\n\nOn the other hand, the question as to whether the Tribunal may entertain claims based on the Foreign Investment Law of El Salvador will be addressed in the next Section.\n\n**D. Can the Tribunal Hear Claims arising under the Foreign Investment Law of El Salvador, Regardless of the Waiver Provision?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*(a) The Parties' Positions*\n----------------------------\n\n118.\n\nClaimants contend that \"the current proceeding is based on two separate arbitral consents\", one arising under CAFTA and the other under the Foreign Investment Law of El Salvador. Claimants argue that the Waiver Provision has no effect on their claims submitted under the Investment Law, such that in the event the Tribunal agrees with Respondent regarding the Waiver Provision, Claimants\u2019 other claims can be heard.68\n\nPO Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 98-100.\n\n119.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants\u2019 claims under the Investment Law cannot be heard in these proceedings because they were not raised in the Request, and neither the ICSID Rules nor CAFTA allow for a Request to be amended. In any event, Respondent argues that Claimants failed to particularize their claims regarding Respondent\u2019s alleged violation of its Investment Law.69\n\nPO Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 112-120.\n\n120.\n\nAt the Hearing, Respondent further specified as follows:70\n\nI also just want to point out, there has been a considerable discussion of whether or not the waiver applies to the investment law proceedings regarding the investment law before this tribunal. We\u2019ve heard the position of the parties.\n\nFrom El Salvador\u2019s point of view, that issue is not yet ripe for decision. It has not yet been placed before the tribunal. El Salvador again reserves its right to raise that issue if the time came, but would hope that the tribunal would reserve a decision on that until it has been fully briefed, as it is a rather significant and complicated legal issue.\n\nTr. 278.\n\n*(b) The Tribunal's Analysis*\n-----------------------------\n\n121.\n\nRespondent\u2019s position is, first and foremost, that the Tribunal cannot accept jurisdiction under the Investment Law because Claimants have failed to assert any claims thereunder.71 Respondent\u2019s alternative position, as articulated in \u00b6 120 above, is that in the event the Tribunal decided that such claims have been asserted, the Parties should be invited to brief the Tribunal as to whether those claims are subject to the Waiver Provision.\n\n*See* PO Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 112-114, under the caption \"Claimants did not submit any claims of violations of the Investment Law\".\n\n122.\n\nClaimants have responded to Respondent\u2019s primary argument by stating that \"[i]t is evident on the face of the Notice of Arbitration that the same measures that give rise to CAFTA claims also give rise to breaches of the Foreign Investment Law\"72, and that Claimants did not refer to the Foreign Investment Law in the Request \"because of the various rules in CAFTA\" and because such was \"not required under the ICSID Institution Rules or the ICSID Arbitration Rules\".73\n\nPO Rejoinder, \u00b6 93.\n\nPO Rejoinder, \u00b6 95.\n\n123.\n\nDespite this, Claimants \"confirm that they have submitted a claim for breach of the Foreign Investment Law, in particular for breaches of Article 5 (equal protection), Article 6 (non-discrimination) and Article 8 (compensation for expropriation)\".74\n\nPO Rejoinder, \u00b6 94, 97.\n\n124.\n\nThe Tribunal is not satisfied that Claimants have in fact raised any claims - *i.e.,* causes of action - under the Foreign Investment Law. Claimants have, at most, given explanations as to why they have not done so (*see* \u00b6 122 above). Further, Claimants\u2019 \"confirmation\" that they have submitted a claim for breach of the Foreign Investment Law is unsupported by their submissions. Claimants have not articulated any claims; rather, as the following review of the submissions demonstrates, they have provided a perfunctory recital of the articles of the Foreign Investment Law, at most.\n\n125.\n\nIndeed, in \u00b6 1 of the Request, Claimants state that the Request was filed pursuant to the ICSID Convention, CAFTA and the Foreign Investment Law. Claimants make no other reference to the Foreign Investment Law in this document, not even in \u00b6 31 where they set forth their request for relief (referring only to \"El Salvador\u2019s violation of its obligations under CAFTA-DR with respect to treatment of foreign investors\").\n\n126.\n\nIn \u00b6\u00b6 80 - 83 of the PO Response, Claimants submit that the revocation of the environmental permits and the *de facto* ban on mining constitute violations \"of CAFTA and the Foreign Investment Law\". However, no provision of the Foreign Investment Law is specifically referred to in those paragraphs. Similarly, in \u00b6\u00b6 84 - 86 of the same submission, Claimants state that there are \"multiple claims arising from two separate sources (the CAFTA and the Foreign Investment Law)\", but no specific reference to the Foreign Investment Law is made there, either. Aside from in these paragraphs, the PO Response makes only passing reference to the Foreign Investment Law.\n\n127.\n\nIt is only late in the pleadings stage, at \u00b6\u00b6 92 - 97 of the PO Rejoinder, that Claimants finally make specific reference to the Foreign Investment Law. As noted in \u00b6 123 above, Claimants \"confirm that they have submitted a claim for breach of the Foreign Investment Law, in particular for breaches of Article 5 (equal protection), Article 6 (non-discrimination) and Article 8 (compensation for expropriation)\". However, aside from listing the article numbers and their captions, Claimants have not made reference to the specific provisions of any of these articles, nor have they indicated how the facts of this case apply to those specific provisions. In other words, Claimants have, at best, made belated contentions under the Foreign Investment Law that remain un-particularized; they have not articulated any specific causes of action.\n\n128.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that there are no claims to be heard in this arbitration under the Foreign Investment Law, regardless of any Waiver Provision. In light of this, the dismissal of the CAFTA claims necessarily entails dismissal of the entire case.\n\n**VIII. Costs**\n---------------\n\n**A. The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n129.\n\nOn 17 November 2010, the Secretary to the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their respective \"statements of costs\" by 30 November 2010.\n\n130.\n\nOn 30 November 2010, Claimants submitted an Application for Costs, requesting the Tribunal to:\n\nOrder Respondent to reimburse the Claimants for the Claimants\u2019 portion of the Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses, along with ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses, associated with the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objection; and,\n\nOrder Respondent to reimburse the Claimants for US$ 145,120.59, representing the attorney fees and expenses paid and/or incurred by Claimants, with interest at a rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date of the Award until final payment.\n\n131.\n\nThat same day, Respondent submitted a statement of costs amounting to US$ 790,399. In addition, Respondent specified that its statement did not include its legal fees and costs incurred before 1 July 2010, in keeping with statements made to Claimants earlier in the proceedings.\n\n132.\n\nOn 1 December 2010, Respondent objected to Claimants\u2019 Application for Costs on the basis that the Tribunal had simply asked for a statement of costs, *i.e.*, \"a list of a party\u2019s arbitration costs, submitted in the event the Tribunal decides to award costs to that party pursuant to an application for costs the party made earlier during the proceeding\". Respondent submitted that if \"the Tribunal decides to admit Claimants\u2019 application for costs\", it would like an opportunity to respond.\n\n133.\n\nThe Tribunal granted Respondent the opportunity to provide its comments on Claimants\u2019 Application for Costs, which it did on 2 February 2011.\n\n134.\n\nIn its comments, Respondent disputes Claimants\u2019 Application for Costs, but \"reaffirms its request for costs and fees plus interest\". Respondent argues that it is entitled to recover its own costs because Claimants\u2019 claim was \"frivolous\", as evidenced by, among other things, \"Claimants\u2019 intention all along [...] to wait for the Supreme Court to issue its decisions and to keep the CAFTA arbitration open in case they lost\". Respondent also argues that it is entitled to recover its costs because Claimants made frivolous arguments during the arbitration (*e.g.*, waiver was not a condition to consent, it was up to Respondent to make the waiver effective) and in their Application for Costs.\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nArticle 10.20.6 of CAFTA provides as follows:\n\nWhen it decides a respondent\u2019s objection under paragraph 4 or 5, the tribunal may, if warranted, award to the prevailing disputing party reasonable costs and attorney\u2019s fees incurred in submitting or opposing the objection. In determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant\u2019s claim or the respondent\u2019s objection was frivolous, and shall provide the disputing parties a reasonable opportunity to comment.\n\n136.\n\nArticle 10.20.6 sets forth a test for tribunals to assess costs, namely, \"the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant\u2019s claim or the respondent\u2019s objection was frivolous\". In light of this, the Tribunal understands the power granted under this Article to be limited, turning on whether the Tribunal considers Claimants claims or Respondent\u2019s preliminary objection to be \"frivolous\".\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal has found entirely in favor of Respondent. However, to conclude from Respondent\u2019s victory that Claimants\u2019 claims were \"frivolous\" would be to go too far. Indeed, the Tribunal has been presented with no indication that Claimants were not serious about the claims they asserted in these proceedings, nor that Claimants pursued this matter in bad faith.\n\n138.\n\nIn light of this, the Tribunal considers that there are no grounds pursuant to Article 10.20.6 of CAFTA to award costs to either side.\n\n139.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal shall order each side to bear one-half of the costs of arbitration, and each Party to bear its own legal fees and expenses.\n\n**IX. Decisions**\n-----------------\n\n140.\n\nFOR THE FOREGOING REASONS, the Tribunal renders the following decisions:\n\n(1) DETERMINES that the dispute is not within its jurisdiction and competence pursuant to CAFTA;\n\n(2) ORDERS each side to bear one-half of the costs of arbitration, and each Party to bear its own legal fees and expenses; and\n\n(3) DISMISSES all other claims or requests for relief."}, {"Title": "Decision on El Salvador's Application for Security for Costs (Annulment Proceeding)", "Type": "Interim & Provisional Measures", "Date": "2012-09-20T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on El Salvador's Application for Security for Costs (Annulment Proceeding)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 12, 2011, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or the \"Centre\") received an Application for Annulment of the award rendered on March 14, 2011 in the arbitration proceeding of *Commerce Group Corp. and San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inc. v. Republic of El Salvador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/17). The application was brought by Commerce Group Corp, and San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inc. (the \"Applicants\" or \"Claimants\") against the Republic of El Salvador (the \"Respondent\" or \"El Salvador\").\n\n2.\n\nOn July 15, 2011, the Centre registered the Application for Annulment pursuant to Arbitration Rule 50(2)(a).\n\n3.\n\nOn August 8, 2011, the *ad hoc* Committee was constituted in accordance with Arbitration Rule 52(2) as follows: Professor Emmanuel Gaillard (French), President; Professor Michael C. Pryles (Australian); and Professor Christoph Schreuer (Austrian).\n\n4.\n\nOn August 17, 2011, the Centre requested the Applicants to pay US$ 150,000.00 pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e).\n\n5.\n\nOn September 26, 2011, the *ad hoc* Committee held a first session with the parties by telephone conference.\n\n6.\n\nOn October 24, 2011, the Centre informed the parties that it had not received the advance payment from the Applicants. In accordance with Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d), the Centre invited either party to pay the outstanding balance.\n\n7.\n\nOn November 17, 2011, the Applicants replied to the Centre\u2019s letter of October 24, 2011. The Applicants stated that they were engaged in efforts to satisfy the request, but were unable to pay the advance at that time.\n\n8.\n\nOn December 15, 2011, El Salvador replied to the Applicants letter of November 17, 2011. It noted that it would not make the payment on behalf of the Applicants pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d).\n\n9.\n\nOn December 15, 2011, the Applicants filed their Memorial on annulment.\n\n10.\n\nOn December 19, 2011, the ICSID Secretary-General moved that the Committee stay the proceeding pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulations 14(3)(d) and (e). On the same day, the *ad hoc* Committee decided to stay the proceeding because of the non-payment of the required advances.\n\n11.\n\nOn May 22, 2012, the Centre informed the parties that five months had passed since the December 19, 2011 letter, without receipt of the outstanding payment. It also reminded the parties that if the proceeding was stayed for a consecutive period in excess of six months, the Secretary-General would move that the *ad hoc* Committee discontinue the proceeding.\n\n12.\n\nOn June 18, 2012, the Applicants replied to the Centre\u2019s letter of May 22 and requested a 60-day extension to secure the necessary financing and make the payment.\n\n13.\n\nOn June 21, 2012, El Salvador wrote to the ICSID Secretary-General to oppose the Applicants\u2019 request.\n\n14.\n\nOn June 22, the Applicants renewed their request for a 60-day extension.\n\n15.\n\nOn July 3, 2012, El Salvador noted that if the Secretary-General or the *ad hoc* Committee decided to grant the Applicants\u2019 request for additional time, El Salvador would request that the continuation of the annulment proceeding be conditioned on their ability to provide security for costs.\n\n16.\n\nOn July 10, 2012, the Committee decided to grant a one-time 10-day extension pursuant to which the Applicants had until July 20, 2012 to make the outstanding payment.\n\n17.\n\nOn July 23, 2012, the proceeding was resumed following payment of the required advance.\n\n18.\n\nOn August 3, 2012, the Committee fixed the procedural calendar, including a schedule for El Salvador\u2019s potential request for security for costs.\n\n19.\n\nOn August 10, 2012, El Salvador filed its Application for Security for Costs.\n\n20.\n\nOn August 17, 2012, the Applicants filed their Response to El Salvador\u2019s Application.\n\n21.\n\nOn August 21, 2012, the Committee decided to allow a second round of submissions regarding El Salvador\u2019s Application and fixed a schedule for this purpose. Pursuant to the schedule, El Salvador filed its Reply Application for Security for Costs on August 27, 2012, and the Applicants filed their Rejoinder on El Salvador\u2019s Application for Security for Costs on September 5, 2012.\n\n**II. THE PARTIES\u2019 RESPECTIVE POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Committee order the Applicants to post security corresponding to its estimated legal fees and costs as well as to the estimated fees, costs and expenses of ICSID and the Committee.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent argues that under the ICSID Rules, the Committee can order the posting of security for costs pursuant to the Committee\u2019s inherent powers to preserve the integrity of the proceeding. The Respondent considers that, in the circumstances of this case, the normal procedure for advance payments under the ICSID Administrative and Financial Rules is inadequate to guarantee the integrity of the proceedings.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the Committee\u2019s power to require the posting of security in connection with a stay of enforcement - for which, the Respondent explains, there is no express rule in the ICSID Convention - as an example of the inherent powers of the Committee.\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, in the present case, the Committee should exercise its inherent powers because\n\n\"[u]nlike a tribunal facing a new case that does not wish to prejudge the case before hearing the evidence, here the Committee already has direct, uncontroverted evidence, [...] demonstrating Claimants\u2019 inability to fund this proceeding with the accompanying unfairness of making El Salvador, the Centre, and the Committee assume the risk of expending substantial resources to continue a proceeding that will either be abandoned or funded by a third party. Moreover, the request for security for costs justified by this evidence is unrelated to the merits of Claimants\u2019 application for annulment.\"1\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Application for Security for Costs, August 10, 2012, \u00b6 33.\n\n26.\n\nIndeed, the Respondent points out, the Applicants did not make the advance payment requested by the Centre on August 17, 2011 on time and the Applicants\u2019 failure to do so in the subsequent period led to the suspension of the proceeding on December 19, 2011, which lasted for nearly seven months.\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Applicants initiated an annulment proceeding that they cannot fund. It claims that evidence shows that the Applicants are in a very difficult financial situation and that they are seeking to obtain third-party financing. Accordingly, the Respondent contends, there is a risk that the Applicants will abandon the proceeding for lack of funding.\n\n28.\n\nWhile in such circumstances the Respondent ought to be entitled to a reimbursement of its costs, the Applicants would be without funds to pay the costs and would therefore be able to ignore any order for costs rendered against them.\n\n29.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the amount of security to be posted should be sufficient to cover all of its fees, costs and expenses, as well as those of the Committee and ICSID at the end of the proceeding. The Respondent estimates that, in the circumstances of the case, this amount would be around US$ 2 million. The Respondent requests that the Committee order that the Applicants post this amount as security within 30 days of its decision and, if the Applicants fail to do so, that it discontinue the proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the circumstances would justify discontinuance because the Applicants\u2019 initiation of annulment proceedings that they knew they could not fund constitutes an abuse of process. This is particularly so, according to the Respondent, since the Committee could have discontinued the proceedings after the time limit for the payment of the advance fees requested by the Centre elapsed on June 19, 2012.\n\n**B. The Applicants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Applicants contend that, with its application, the Respondent is asking the *ad hoc* Committee to create an economic bar to the annulment proceeding.\n\n32.\n\nThe Applicants first argue that ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14 \"provides a comprehensive mechanism to address the cost of annulment proceedings by making the applicant solely responsible for making advance payments for the proceeding *upon the request of the Secretary-General\"*.2 They submit that, given the availability of this mechanism, which includes the power to make supplementary advance payments, there is no need for the Committee to rely on its inherent powers to order security for costs.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Response to El Salvador\u2019s Application for Security for Costs, August 17, 2012, \u00b6 23 (emphasis in original).\n\n33.\n\nThe Applicants argue that the Respondent\u2019s application is a disguised application for provisional measures to safeguard the Respondent\u2019s own interests, because, they aver, the issue of \"[s]ecurity for a party\u2019s legal costs is a question of the financial interests of one party and not the integrity of the proceeding\".3 As such, the application should fail because pursuant to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention the Committee does not have the power to order provisional measures.\n\nIbid., 30.\n\n34.\n\nThe Applicants note that the cases dealing with the subject of integrity of proceedings have typically addressed issues such as conflicts of interest, basic procedural fairness, respect for confidentiality and legal privilege, the right of parties to seek advice and to advance their cases freely and non-aggravation of the dispute. According to the Applicants, in those cases, \"the overriding goal of the exercise of inherent powers was to ensure due process and facilitate the adjudication of claims\".4 They submit that the circumstances of the present case do not merit an intervention of that kind.\n\nIbid., \u00b629.\n\n35.\n\nThe Applicants contend that \"in circumstances like these security for a party\u2019s own costs has never been granted by an ICSID tribunal or *ad hoc* Committee\".5 They argue that the Respondent has failed to provide any relevant precedent that supports its request. The Applicants refer to the *Libananco* v. *Turkey* arbitration, in which the Tribunal rejected Turkey\u2019s request for security for costs made pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention on provisional measures.\n\nIbid.,\u00b631.\n\n36.\n\nThe Applicants do not contest the fact that they are in a difficult financial situation, though they note that they \"do not regard themselves as being insolvent\".6 They argue that the Respondent has contributed to their financial difficulties.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 7\n\n37.\n\nThe Applicants insist that they have not acted in bad faith and that their actions do not constitute abuse of process. They note that they have paid the advance payment which was asked of them and that they \"are, quite simply, doing their best with limited resources\".7\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder to El Salvador\u2019s Application for Security for Costs, September 5, 2012, \u00b615.\n\n38.\n\nThe Applicants request that the Respondent\u2019s application is denied and that the costs and expenses associated with addressing the Respondent\u2019s Application for Security for Costs are assessed against the Respondent.\n\n**III. THE COMMITTEE\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent has requested the Committee to issue an order requiring the Applicants to post security for the estimated costs of this annulment proceeding, including for the Respondent\u2019s legal costs. The Respondent contends that this order should be made pursuant to the Committee\u2019s inherent powers to protect the integrity of the proceeding.\n\n40.\n\nWhile the parties agree that an international arbitral tribunal has the inherent powers to order measures to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings, they seem to disagree as to whether these powers include the ability to order, under the appropriate circumstances, that one party post security for the other party\u2019s legal costs and/or other expenses.\n\n41.\n\nIn this connection, the Committee also takes note of the Applicants\u2019 argument that the Respondent\u2019s application seeks only to preserve the Respondent\u2019s interests as opposed to the integrity of the proceeding as a whole and that, as such, its request is a \"disguised\" application for provisional measures and should accordingly be denied, since Article 47 on provisional measures does not apply to annulment proceedings.8 At the same time, the Respondent has explicitly indicated that it is not asking for provisional measures.9\n\nArticle 52(4) of the ICSID Convention provides: \"The provisions of Articles 41-45, 48, 49, 53 and 54, and of Chapters VI and VII shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to proceedings before the Committee\".\n\nEl Salvador\u2019s Application for Security for Costs, August 10, 2012, \u00b6 4.\n\n42.\n\nIn light of the Respondent\u2019s assertion that it is not asking for provisional measures, the Committee will not determine whether or not it has the power to order or recommend provisional measures. The Committee will assess the Respondent\u2019s application only in the context of the Committee\u2019s inherent powers to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings.\n\n43.\n\nFirst, as a preliminary matter, the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations (Regulation 14) and the ICSID Convention (Article 61(2)) establish mechanisms for the advance payment of expenses and for the apportionment of costs in arbitral and annulment proceedings. Accordingly, to the extent possible, any issue relating to the payment of fees or the apportionment of costs that might arise in annulment proceedings ought to be addressed through these mechanisms.\n\n44.\n\nSecond, the exercise of an international tribunal\u2019s inherent powers to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings is an extraordinary control and is to be resorted to only in compelling circumstances.10\n\nSee, *e.g.,* *The Rompetrol Group N. V. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3), Decision of the Tribunal on the Participation of a Counsel of January 14, 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.\n\n45.\n\nAs the guardian of the integrity of the proceeding, the Committee may, in the appropriate situation, use its inherent powers to order security for costs. However, the power to order security for costs should be exercised only in extreme circumstances, for example, where abuse or serious misconduct has been evidenced.\n\n46.\n\nIndeed, in the context of applications for provisional measures, a number of ICSID tribunals have declined to order security for costs.11 Thus, for example, in *Libananco* v. *Turkey,* the tribunal rejected Turkey\u2019s application for security for costs and noted that \"it would only be in the most extreme case - one in which an essential interest of either Party stood in danger of irreparable damage - that the possibility of granting security for costs should be entertained at all\".12\n\nSee, *e.g., Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini* v. *Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Procedural Order No. 2 of October 28, 1999; *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile* (hereinafter *\"Pey Casado* v. *Chile\")* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), Decision on Provisional Measures of September 25, 2001; *Rachel S. Grynberg, Stephen M. Grynberg, Miriam* Z. *Grynberg and RSM Production Corporation* v. *Government of Grenada* (hereinafter *\"RSM et al. v. Grenada\")* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6), Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Respondent\u2019s Application for Security for Costs of October 14,2010.\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co. Limited* v. *Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8), Decision on Preliminary Issues of June 23, 2008, \u00b6 57. Similarly, referring to the decision in *Pey Casado* v. *Chile,* the tribunal in *RSM et al.* v. *Grenada* noted that \"it is simply not part of the ICSID dispute resolution system that an investor\u2019s claim should be heard only upon the establishment of a sufficient financial standing of the investor to meet a possible costs award\". See *RSM et al. v. Grenada,* Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Respondent\u2019s Application for Security for Costs of October 14, 2010, \u00b6 5.19.\n\n47.\n\nIn the present circumstances, no extreme case presents itself.\n\n48.\n\nThe Applicants are experiencing financial difficulties and this they do not deny. These difficulties did cause them to struggle with meeting the deadline to advance the first payment as requested by the Centre and this in turn did lead to a stay of the proceeding. In the end, after having been granted an extension, the Applicants paid the first advance payment.\n\n49.\n\nHowever, without more, it cannot be inferred from these facts that the integrity of the proceeding is endangered.\n\n50.\n\nFurther, the advance payments that the Applicants are obligated to make pursuant to Regulation 14 cover the fees and expenses of both the Committee and the Centre. At this stage, the costs of the proceeding are adequately covered.\n\n51.\n\nThe Committee also notes the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the Applicants are in a difficult financial position and that, if they abandon the proceedings, the Respondent might not be able to recover from the Applicants its legal costs, to which it considers it would be entitled in such circumstances.\n\n52.\n\nAt the same time, the Respondent\u2019s request, if granted, might seriously affect the Applicants\u2019 right to seek annulment of the award. The Committee does not find in the Respondent\u2019s arguments - which rest on several assumptions - a compelling reason to interfere with Applicants\u2019 right to seek annulment of the award.\n\n53.\n\nOverall, the Committee has not been provided with any incontrovertible evidence that the Applicants\u2019 conduct threatens the integrity of the proceedings, that their conduct amounts to abuse or that it is pursued in bad faith.\n\n54.\n\nAt present, any issues relating to the costs associated with this annulment proceeding can be properly addressed by the mechanisms under Regulation 14 of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations and under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n55.\n\nFor the reasons above, the Respondent\u2019s application for security for costs is denied.\n\n56.\n\nNo decision on costs is made at this stage."}]}
