PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn December 16, 2002, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter \"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received from M.C.I. Power Group, L.C. and New Turbine, Inc. (hereinafter \"the Claimants\") a request for arbitration against the Republic of Ecuador (hereinafter \"the Respondent\" or \"Ecuador\"). On December 19, 2002, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the request, and accompanying documentation, together with the prescribed lodging fee, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (hereinafter the \"Institution Rules\"). On December 20, 2002, the Centre transmitted a copy of the request to Ecuador and Ecuador\u2019s Embassy in Washington, D.C. in accordance with Institution Rule 5(2).\n\n2.\n\nAccording to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (\"the ICSID Convention\"), the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the request for arbitration on April 8, 2003. In accordance with Institution Rule 7, the Acting Secretary-General notified the parties on the same date of the registration of the request and invited them to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible.\n\n3.\n\nIn accordance with Rule 2(3) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), on June 9, 2003, Claimants requested that the Arbitral Tribunal in this case be constituted in accordance with the provisions of Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. According to this provision, the Arbitral Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one arbitrator to be appointed by each party and the third, who shall serve as the President of the Tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties. The Claimants appointed the Honorable Benjamin J. Greenberg, Q.C., a Canadian national, and the Respondent appointed Professor Jaime Irarrazabal, a Chilean national. However, the parties failed to agree on the appointment of the third, presiding arbitrator. On July 8, 2003, the Claimants requested that the third, presiding arbitrator be appointed in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the Arbitration Rules.\n\n4.\n\nAfter consulting the parties, Professor Ra\u00fal E. Vinuesa, an Argentinean national, was appointed by the Centre as the third, presiding arbitrator. In accordance with Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, on September 11, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General notified the parties that all three arbitrators accepted their appointment and that the Arbitral Tribunal was deemed to be constituted and the proceedings deemed to begin on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Mariano Garcia-Rubio, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal. Mr. Rubio was later on replaced by Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID. The Tribunal held its first session in Washington, D.C. on November 7, 2003.\n\n5.\n\nMessrs. Barry Appleton, Robert Wisner and Hernando Otero from Appleton and Associates, and Messrs. Jos\u00e9 I. Astig\u00e1rraga and Edward M. Mullins from Astig\u00e1rraga Davis represented the Claimants at the first session. Messrs. Ivor Massey and Richard Gorman also attended on behalf of the Claimants. Ms. Martha Escobar Koziel of the *Procuraduria General del Estado* and Mr. Gustavo Anda of the Embassy of Ecuador in Washington, D.C., represented the Respondent at the first session.\n\n6.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections to any members of the Tribunal. It was also noted that the proceedings would be conducted under the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force since September 26, 1984.\n\n7.\n\nDuring the first session, the parties also agreed on several other procedural matters, which were later reproduced in the written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal. In respect of the pleadings to be filed by the parties, their number, sequence and timing, it was agreed that the Claimants would file a Memorial by February 6, 2004; the Respondent would file a Counter-Memorial within 90 (ninety) days of their receipt of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial; the Claimants would file a Reply within 30 (thirty) days of their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, and the Respondent would file a Rejoinder within 30 (thirty) days of its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 Reply.\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal further noted that, if there were no objections to Jurisdiction, the time-limit for the Claimants\u2019 Memorial shall be followed, in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n9.\n\nOn February 20, 2004, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits and accompanying documentation.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 16, 2004, the Respondent informed the Centre and this Tribunal that the law firm Cabezas & Wray had been appointed as counsel for Ecuador in the present case, being authorized to represent the Respondent either independently or jointly with the *Procuraduria General del Estado.*\n\n11.\n\nOn June 16, 2004, the Respondent raised some objections to the Jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal. In the same communication, counsel for the Respondent indicated that Messrs Robert Volterra and Alejandro Escobar of the law firm Herbert Smith, in London, were also appointed as cocounsel for Ecuador.1\n\nMr. Volterra and Mr. Escobar later on joined the law firm Latham & Watkins, in London.\n\n12.\n\nOn June 18, 2004, the Claimants made preliminary observations on Ecuador\u2019s objections on Jurisdiction, to which counsel for the Respondent replied by letter of June 21, 2004.\n\n13.\n\nOn June 23, 2004, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, suspending the proceeding with respect to the Merits in accordance with Rule 41(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and fixing a timetable for the Jurisdictional phase, according to which Respondent would have 30 (thirty) days (by July 26, 2004) to submit its Memorial on Jurisdiction; Claimants would have 30 (thirty) days from their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction to file their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction; the Respondent would file its Reply on Jurisdiction within 15 (fifteen) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction; and the Claimants would file a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction within 15 (fifteen) days from their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction.\n\n14.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on July 26, 2004, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction. Thereafter, on August 23, 2004, Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction; on September 14, 2004, the Respondent filed it Reply on Jurisdiction; and on October 1, 2004, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n15.\n\nAs it had been scheduled, after consultation with the parties, the Hearing on Jurisdiction was held in Washington, D.C. on December 13 and 14, 2004. At the Hearing, the Claimants were represented by Messrs. Ivor Massey, Richard Gorman, Jack Haeflich, Barry Appleton, Jos\u00e9 I. Astigarraga, Robert Wisner and Hernando Otero, and as Observers from Appleton & Associates, Nick Gallus, Ali Ghiassi and Asha Kaushal. The Respondent was represented by Messrs. Alberto Wray Espinosa, Ernesto Alb\u00e1n Ricaurte, Alvaro Galindo, Alejandro Escobar, Robert Volterra, Danilo Sylva and Martha Escobar Koziel. During the Hearing, the Tribunal also put questions to the parties in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 32(3).\n\n16.\n\nOn April 4 2005, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, joining the objections to Jurisdiction to the Merits of the dispute, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4) and number 8 in Procedural Order No. 1 of June 23, 2004. A timetable was set for the continuation of the proceeding, according to which the Respondent was to file its Counter-Memorial by May 19, 2005; the Claimants would have 30 (thirty) days from their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial to file their Reply; and the Respondent would file its Rejoinder within 30 (thirty) days after its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 Reply.\n\n17.\n\nOn May 5, 2005, after due consideration of the Respondent\u2019s letter of April 25, 2005, as well as of the Claimants\u2019 response of April 26, 2005, the Tribunal decided to grant an extension of 15 days to counsel for the Respondent to file its Counter-Memorial (i.e. by June 3, 2005).\n\n18.\n\nOn June 3, 2005, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits.\n\n19.\n\nOn July 8, 2005, the Claimants, invoking the principle of equality, requested an extension to file its Reply, which was due by July 15, 2005. On July 13, 2005, The Tribunal granted an extension for the Claimants to file their Reply until August 1, 2005.\n\n20.\n\nOn July 13, 2005, the Tribunal, after considering the Respondent\u2019s request for production of documents (letters of June 23 and July 7, 2005), as well as Claimants\u2019 response of July 1, 2005, denied such request. However, the Tribunal noted that it reserved its powers to call upon the parties to produce any documents, witnesses and experts, if it so deemed necessary at any stage of the proceeding.\n\n21.\n\nOn July 22, 2005, the Claimants filed their Reply on the Merits; and thereafter, on August 31, 2005, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits.\n\n22.\n\nOn February 2, 2006, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, concerning the organization of the Merits Hearing.\n\n23.\n\nAs it had been confirmed by the Tribunal to the parties on October 11, 2005, the Merits Hearing took place on March 20-24, 2006, in Washington, D.C. Present at the Hearing were:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal*\n\nProfessor Ra\u00fal E. Vinuesa, President  \nThe Honorable Benjamin J.

JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n**1. INTRODUCTION: OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nAs indicated above, on July 26, 2004 Ecuador submitted a Memorial objecting to the Jurisdiction (hereafter Memorial on Jurisdiction) with respect to the claims raised by the Claimants, requesting that the Tribunal declare the dispute not within the Jurisdiction of ICSID, nor the competence of the Tribunal, that it decline to consider the case on the Merits, and that it order the Claimants to pay Ecuador the costs of the proceedings and the cost of legal representation.\n\n27.\n\nIn its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Ecuador alleges that it had not given its written consent for this case to be submitted to ICSID arbitration, as required under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Ecuador argues that this lack of consent cannot be overcome by the provisions of the Bilateral Investment Treaty concluded between Ecuador and the United States of August 27, 1993 (hereinafter the \"BIT\" or the \"Treaty\"), because the facts used to support the Claimants\u2019 allegations arose before the entry into force of that Treaty, that is, before May 11, 1997.\n\n28.\n\nEcuador contends that the claims refer to two separate situations, which involve entirely different legal principles; these situations were consummated and legally defined before the BIT entered into force.\n\n29.\n\nThe first of these situations has to do with a contract signed in Quito on November 7, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as \"the Seacoast Contract\"), and the Memorandum of Clarification for the Execution of the Contract (hereinafter referred to as \"Clarification Contract\") signed on the same date, by which Seacoast agreed to provide power to the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Electrificaci\u00f3n (hereinafter referred to as \"INECEL\") for six months starting on November 18, 1995, using equipment that it agreed to bring into Ecuador at its own expense and risk under the temporary admission of imports regime. Ecuador contends that INECEL communicated to Seacoast that the contract would terminate by May 1996.\n\n30.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, Seacoast claimed that the termination of the contract was untimely, that it had only been paid for the energy consumed and not for the energy made available, and that the fines imposed on it for breach of contract were inapplicable. Ecuador believes that these allegations raised by the Claimants in the present case are unjustified with respect to the BIT, as Seacoast had persisted in its claims by suing INECEL before the Ecuadorian courts in 1996.\n\n31.\n\nIn the opinion of Ecuador, the second situation referred to in the request has no connection whatsoever to the first. It relates to the contract that INECEL entered into on January 24, 1997 with Power Services Ecuador Ecuapower (hereinafter referred to as \"the Ecuapower Contract\") by which the latter agreed to provide it with power.\n\n32.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the original shareholders of Ecuapower, in whose ownership structure the Claimants say they participated, transferred their shares in full on March 6, 1997 to four other companies, which were also foreign-owned. According to Ecuador, the Claimants believed that Ecuadorian officials caused an unwarranted delay in the signing of the Ecuapower Contract and because of this delay they were forced to sell their investment under disadvantageous terms, for which they are seeking compensation in the present claim.\n\n33.\n\nEcuador alleges that the disputes caused by the two abovementioned situations arose before the BIT entered into force, and therefore they did not give rise to rights in favor of the Claimants, nor have they generated any obligation whatsoever on the part of Ecuador under the provisions of the BIT.\n\n34.\n\nMoreover, Ecuador alleges that when the BIT entered into force, the Claimants did not have an investment under that Treaty. It also alleges that the events that occurred after the entry into force of the BIT simply consisted of successive and failed attempts to resolve these disputes and therefore they have not given rise to any rights in favor of the Claimants nor any obligation for Ecuador.\n\n35.\n\nEcuador argues that the BIT is not retroactive, nor are there any circumstances that would justify its retroactive application. Even under the assumption that the BIT was applicable to this case, Ecuador contends that the dispute would still not fall under the Competence of the Tribunal because it did not arise directly out of an investment under the terms of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT at the time when the latter entered into force; or because the arbitration option was precluded under Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT.\n\n36.\n\nIn summary, Ecuador argues that the dispute submitted does not fall within the Jurisdiction of the Centre *ratione temporis* and subsidiarily, that the dispute does not arise out of an investment and that there was a preclusion of the arbitral option, owing to the Claimants\u2019 submission of the dispute to the domestic courts of Ecuador (\"for-in-the-road\").\n\n37.\n\nOn 23 August 2004 the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction (hereinafter referred to as \"the Counter-Memorial\").\n\n38.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal has Competence based on the following reasons: the Claimants had an investment within the terms of the ICSID Convention and the BIT at all relevant times; the Tribunal must consider events before the BIT\u2019s entry into force; events subsequent to that date attributable to Ecuador violated the BIT; and the Claimants have not triggered the \"fork-in-the-road\" provision of the Treaty. The Claimants therefore ask the Tribunal to reject Ecuador\u2019s objections to Jurisdiction and award costs to the Claimants.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimants allege that as legal entities of the United States of America they own and control Seacoast. In their view, Seacoast, in turn, is a United States corporation that invested in Ecuador through a branch operation. This branch carried on the business of acquiring, assembling and installing two electricity generating plants and selling their power to INECEL, an Ecuadorian state-owned entity. After these operations were completed and the power generating assets sold, Seacoast continued to hold and manage its accounts receivable and other contractual rights against INECEL. Thus, the Seacoast branch and its intangible assets in Ecuador were an *investment* before and after the entry into force of the BIT.\n\n40.\n\nAfter the entry into force of the BIT, the Claimants allege that they continued to own the Seacoast branch in Ecuador. This branch had a legal representative, an office in Ecuador, and an operating permit. Seacoast held and managed substantial accounts receivable and other contractual rights against INECEL. Consequently, the Claimants allege that Ecuador violated the BIT through acts subsequent to its entry into force.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal, having examined the submissions put forward by the parties in these arbitration proceedings with respect to the question of its Competence to hear the Merits of the present dispute, and having evaluated the relevant arguments on the Merits put forward by both parties, has decided to deal first with the main objection of the non-retroactivity of the BIT, and then deal with each of the subsidiary objections relating to the non-existence of an investment and the preclusion of the BIT\u2019s \"fork-in-the-road\" provision.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal will decide on the objections to Jurisdiction raised by the Respondent and rejected by the Claimants in accordance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention, the BIT, and the applicable norms of general international law, including the customary rules recognized in the Final Draft of the International Law Commission of the UN (hereinafter referred to as \"the ILC\") Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries (hereinafter referred to as \"the ILC Draft\").2\n\nAvailable at http://www.ejil.org/joumal/Voll2/No5/art2.html.\n\n43.\n\nFor purposes of interpreting the treaties applicable to the objections submitted, the Tribunal will be guided by the rules contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (hereafter \"the Vienna Convention\") that reflect the customary law on the subject.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal will refer to precedents that state the legal implications of binding norms of conventional and customary international law that are applicable only to the extent that and insofar as they specifically relate to the present case.\n\n**2. MAIN OBJECTION TO THE COMPETENCE OF THE TRIBUNAL. THE NON-RETROACTIVITY OF THE BIT: EFFECT ON EVENTS ALLEGED TO BE PRIOR AND SUBSEQUENT TO THE ENTRY INTOFORCE OF THE BIT.**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nEcuador alleges that the BIT is not retroactive. By the terms of the Treaty, it entered into force thirty days after exchange of the respective instruments of ratification, that is, on May 11, 1997.\n\n46.\n\nEcuador cites as precedents the preliminary decisions adopted in the *Marvin Roy Feldman Kapra v. United Mexican States* and the *Mondev v. United States of America* cases in order to put forward the argument that before the BIT entered into force there was no consent to be bound and therefore no obligation arising from the Treaty can be attributed to a State Party.\n\n47.\n\nIn support of its argument, it cites Article 28 of the Vienna Convention, which states:\n\n*Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.*\n\n48.\n\nEcuador also invokes Article XII of the BIT which sets out the treaty\u2019s temporal application to investments in existence at the time it entered into force as well as investments made or acquired thereafter. Thus, according to Ecuador, the scope of the treaty excludes any investment that had ceased to exist at that date.\n\n49.\n\nEcuador concludes that the only factual grounds of the claims put forward in the request refer to acts consummated and legally defined before the entry into force of the BIT. It maintains that neither in the framework of the Seacoast Contract nor in that of the Ecuapower Contract did the Claimants own shares in the investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. But even assuming that they did, such alleged investments had ceased to exist before the BIT entered into force.\n\n50.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, the Seacoast Contract terminated in May 1996 upon expiry of the term. Even if we accept Seacoast\u2019s argument with regard to the term of the Contract, the latter would in any event have terminated before the BIT entered into force.\n\n51.\n\nEcuador contends that when the BIT entered into force there was a dispute in existence that had been submitted to the Ecuadorian courts, for the untimely termination of the Seacoast Contract, payment for the installed capacity of power, return of the fines imposed, and reimbursement of the cost of fuel.\n\n52.\n\nIn support of this argument about the existence of a dispute Ecuador cites the *Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* precedent regarding the importance of the critical date for purposes of deciding whether a dispute falls within the consent necessary to warrant ICSID Jurisdiction under a BIT. Ecuador maintains that in the present case the critical date, that is the date when the dispute arose, is prior to the entry into force of the BIT.\n\n53.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, when the BIT entered into force, Seacoast had sold all its equipment, its operations had ceased, and it had submitted the dispute with INECEL to the Ecuadorian tribunals. It had no investment whatsoever, nor rights substantiated in titles or registers to which the status of investment could possibly be attributed *prima facie.*\n\n54.\n\nAs for the Claimants\u2019 demand for compensation for the supposedly wrongful conduct on the part of Ecuadorian authorities in the signing of the contract between Ecuapower and INECEL on January 24, 1997 and the allegation that those events caused the forced sale of their investment on March 6, 1997, Ecuador maintains that, on the assumption that the facts invoked as grounds for the claim were true, they would not fall within the temporal provisions of the BIT as they would have occurred before the Treaty entered into force. With regard to subsequent events alleged by the Claimants to be in violation of the BIT, Ecuador considers them to be merely pleadings concerning disputes that had already been raised prior to the entry into force of the BIT.\n\n55.\n\nFor their part, the Claimants do not deny the date of entry into force of the BIT, nor do they deny the non-retroactive nature of the BIT.\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimants put forward the arguments that the Tribunal must consider events occurring before the BIT entered into force because Ecuador\u2019s actions before the BIT entered into force were continuing or composite breaches; Ecuador had a duty to act in good faith following its signature of the BIT; and moreover, the BIT\u2019s most-favored-nation clause and Article VII of the Argentina-Ecuador BIT demonstrate Ecuador\u2019s intention that the US-Ecuador BIT would have limited retrospective effect. The Claimants are also claiming as violations of the BIT acts attributable to Ecuador subsequent to the entry into force of the BIT. Finally, the Claimants submit that events occurring before the BIT came into force are important in determining the damage caused by Ecuador\u2019s actions after that date.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that this Tribunal\u2019s consideration of events occurring before the BIT\u2019s entry into force in the aforementioned circumstances is not a breach of the principle of non-retroactivity recognized in the Vienna Convention and the ILC Draft. The Claimants allege that Article XII of the BIT does not limit its temporal application to disputes arising subsequent to its entry into force.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal can examine conduct occurring before the BIT came into force when that conduct continues beyond that date. They maintain that Article 28 of the Vienna Convention only curtails a tribunal\u2019s ability to examine conduct occurring before a treaty comes into force to the extent that that conduct ceased to exist before the date on which the treaty entered into force.\n\n59.\n\nFrom the analysis of the text and background of the BIT, the Tribunal holds that the intention of the contracting Parties with respect to its retrospective application is not evident from its clauses or in any other manner. In accordance with the norms of general international law codified in the Vienna Convention, and particularly in Article 28, the Tribunal notes that because of the fact that the BIT applies to investments existing at the time of its entry into force, the temporal effects of its clauses are not modified.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the temporal requirements under Article XII of the BIT, which states:\n\n*[This Treaty] shall apply to investments existing at the time of entry into force as well as to investments made or acquired thereafter.*\n\n61.\n\nThe non-retroactivity of the BIT excludes its application to disputes arising prior to its entry into force. Any dispute arising prior to that date will not be capable of being submitted to the dispute resolution system established by the BIT. The silence of the text of the BIT with respect to its scope in relation to disputes prior to its entry into force does not alter the effects of the principle of the non-retroactivity of treaties.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal distinguishes acts and omissions prior to the entry into force of the BIT from acts and omissions subsequent to that date as violations of the BIT. The Tribunal holds that a dispute that arises that is subject to its Competence is necessarily related to the violation of a norm of the BIT by act or omission subsequent to its entry into force.\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that under the general international law applicable, a dispute means a disagreement on a point of fact or of law, a conflict of legal opinions or of interests as between the parties.3 The existence of a dispute determines the critical date after which the parties cannot fail to recognize its existence.\n\n*Mavommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v. UK.),* Jurisdiction (1924), *PSIJ Series* A, No. 2, p. 11; *Northern Cameroons (Cameroons v. United Kingdom),* Judgment (1963), *ICJ Reports 1963,* p. 27; *Applicability of the Obligation to Arbitrate under Section 21 of the United Nations Headquarters Agreement* of 26 June, 1947, Advisory Opinion (1988), *ICJ Reports 1988,* p. 27.\n\n64.\n\nWith respect to acts or omissions alleged by the Claimants to be breaches of the BIT subsequent to its entry into force, the Tribunal considers that it has Competence insofar and as those facts are proven to be a violation of the BIT. This determination of the Tribunal does not prejudge the subsequent evaluation of the allegations of both parties on the existence or not of a violation at the time of a decision on the Merits.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal likewise distinguishes disputes arising prior to the entry into force of the BIT from disputes arising after that date that have the same cause or background with those prior disputes.4\n\n*Jan de Nul N.V.and Dredging International NV v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/13), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of June 16, 2006, para. 127.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that a prior dispute may evolve into a new dispute,5 but the fact that this new dispute has arisen does not change the effects of the non-retroactivity of the BIT with respect to the dispute prior to its entry into force. Prior disputes that continue after the entry into force of the BIT are not covered by the BIT.\n\n*Helnan International Hotels A/S v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of October 17, 2006, para. 53.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal notes the Parties agree that the BIT in principle does not have retroactive effect. Nevertheless, they do not agree as to the scope of the BIT with regard to certain acts or omissions attributable to Ecuador, prior and subsequent to its entry into force.\n\n68.\n\nAs regards the allegations put forward by the Claimants on the issue of non-retroactivity of the BIT in response to the objections to Jurisdiction raised by the Respondent, the Tribunal will now evaluate the relevance of the arguments concerning the scope and extent of continuing and composite acts (point a), obligations arising under Article 18 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (point b), most-favored-nation clause (point c), and acts relevant in determining injury (point d).\n\n**a. Continuing and composite acts**\n------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Ecuador breached its BIT obligations by continuing and composite wrongful acts. They contend that Ecuador\u2019s policy of discriminating against Seacoast began on April 8, 1996 when INECEL defaulted on the first invoice from Seacoast. The act then continued until Ecuador relied on the arbitrary and illegal revocation of Seacoast\u2019s operating permit to reject Seacoast\u2019s claim in the Ecuadorian courts and refuse to arbitrate.\n\n70.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Ecuador\u2019s final refusal to pay occurred when the Liquidation Commission proceedings were considered terminated, after the BIT had entered into force. That Commission was an integral element of the Seacoast Contract. Therefore, the Claimants argue, expropriation of Seacoast\u2019s contractual rights was only complete after the Liquidation Commission proceedings were concluded.\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that Articles 14 and 15 of the ILC Draft recognize that an act commencing before a treaty enters into force can breach the treaty if the act continues past that date or has composite elements occurring beyond that date.\n\n72.\n\nDespite the written text of Article 14(2) of the ILC Draft, the Claimants submit that the breach of an international obligation by a continuing act of a State does not exclude the possibility that a series of acts will constitute a continuing wrongful act. In this regard they make reference to the *Tecmed v. Mexico* case in which, according to the Claimants, the Tribunal referred to \"the conduct\" that continues in the time before and after the entry into force of the BIT, as a factor in determining if there had been a breach of that treaty.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants cite a number of cases in which the Inter-American Court of Human Rights as well as the European Court of Human Rights have accepted the notion of a continuing act from a succession of acts attributable to a State.\n\n74.\n\nWith respect to the continuing or composite character of events prior to the entry into force of the BIT, Ecuador maintains that, assuming the facts presented in the request contain the necessary elements to amount to an internationally wrongful act, such act would be neither composite nor continuing.\n\n75.\n\nEcuador rejects the arguments in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the composite and continuing nature of the alleged wrongful acts attributed to the Ecuadorian authorities with respect to the Seacoast Contract. Ecuador contends that even if there were indeed an internationally wrongful act that had commenced prior to the entry into force of the BIT, such act did not continue after that date so as to fall under the Treaty\u2019s provisions relating to internationally wrongful acts of a continuing and composite nature occurring prior to May 1997, as alleged.\n\n76.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, by using this argument the Claimants are trying to elude the main issue of the non-existence of an investment at the time the Treaty entered into force. Ecuador contends that the Claimants erred in relying on the *Tecmed* case because in that case the existence of an investment at the time the treaty entered into force was not an issue.\n\n77.\n\nEcuador contends that in the *Tecmed* case the tribunal held that its competence extended to events that occurred prior to the date the treaty entered into force, but only after the issue of Jurisdiction had been resolved, not by reason of the retroactive application of any provision of the BIT, but because an investment actually existed at the time the BIT entered into force.\n\n78.\n\nEcuador argues that the Claimants failed to make a distinction between the existence of a continuing wrongful act and the effects of a consummated breach. It cites the International Law Commission\u2019s Commentaries on the ILC Draft, which states that an act does not have a continuing character merely because its effects or consequences extend in time. It must be the wrongful act as such which continues.6\n\nCrawford, J., *The International Law Commission\u2019s Articles on State Responsibility,* Cambridge University Press, 2002, p. 135 et seq.\n\n79.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, the dispute concerning the payment of amounts supposedly owed by INECEL to Seacoast bears no relationship at all to the concept of an internationally wrongful act or to wrongful acts of a continuing character. Even assuming the existence of a wrongful act, such act was consummated by the alleged disregard of rights, which is clearly distinguishable from a mere consequence thereof.\n\n80.\n\nEcuador contends that the existence of a composite act requires a series of actions or omissions defined as a whole as wrongful. It cites the Commentary of the ILC with respect to composite acts to the effect that similar considerations apply as for completed and continuing wrongful acts in determining when a breach of international law exists; the matter is dependent upon the precise facts and the content of the primary obligation.7\n\n*Ibid,* p. 141 et seq.\n\n81.\n\nEcuador concludes that the offence alleged by the Claimants was consummated prior to the entry into force of the BIT in a completed act by which INECEL refused to recognize the rights that Seacoast claimed.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that, in accordance with customary international law, the relevant element to determine the existence of a continuing wrongful act or a composite wrongful act is the violation of a norm of international law existing at the time when that act that extends in time begins or when it is consummated.\n\n83.\n\nThe line of reasoning adopted by intergovernmental bodies for the protection of human rights as well as human rights tribunals in order to typify acts of a continuing wrongful nature, stresses the continuity of those acts after the treaty giving rise to the breached obligation entered into force.\n\n84.\n\nWith respect to the various positions taken by the Parties regarding the case *Tecmed v. the United Mexican States8* the Tribunal holds that the only interpretation possible is that which is consistent with the international law applicable to the case. In light of this, it is arguable that the *Tecmed* tribunal determined its jurisdiction on the basis of allegations that an internationally wrongful act had occurred after the treaty had entered into force. Thus, the tribunal understood that in order to determine its jurisdiction it should consider the necessary existence of a dispute that arose under the terms of the BIT after the treaty had entered into force. In the view of that tribunal, events or situations prior to the entry into force of the treaty may be relevant as antecedents to disputes arising after that date.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award of May 29, 2003, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/laudo-051903%20-English.pdf.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of the content of the norms of customary international law set out in the ILC Draft in order to clarify the scope of continuing wrongful acts as well as composite wrongful acts.\n\n86.\n\nWith respect to continuing wrongful acts, Article 14 of the ILC Draft provides:\n\n*The breach of an international obligation by an act of a State having a continuing character extends over the entire* *period during which the act continues and remains not in conformity with the international obligation...*\n\n87.\n\nIn its Commentary to this Article the ILC states:\n\n*In accordance with paragraph 2, a continuing wrongful act, on the other hand, occupies the entire period during which the act continues and remains not in conformity with the international obligation, provided that the State is bound by the international obligation during that period.9*\n\nCrawford, J., *op.cit.,* p. 136 para. (3)\n\n88.\n\nWith regard to composite wrongful acts, Article 15 of the ILC Draft states as follows:\n\n*Breach consisting of a composite act*\n\n*The breach of an international obligation by a State through a series of actions or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful occurs when the action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act.*\n\n*In such a case, the breach extends over the entire period starting with the first of the actions or omissions of the series and lasts for as long as these actions or omissions are repeated and remain not in conformity with the international obligation.*\n\n89.\n\nIn its Commentary to the Draft Articles, the ILC states that in accordance with the principle of the inter-temporality of law:\n\n*...the State must be bound by the international obligation for the period during which the series of acts making up the breach is committed. In cases where the relevant obligation did not exist at the beginning of the course of conduct but came into being thereafter, the \"first\" of the actions or omissions of the series for the purposes of State Responsibility will be the first occurring after the obligation came into existence.10*\n\n*Ibid,* p. 144, para. (11)\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the wrongful acts defined as continuing or composite referred to in Articles 14 and 15 of the ILC Draft are internationally wrongful acts. This means that they are identified with the violation of a norm of international law. According to Article 13 of the Draft Articles, in order for a wrongful act or omission to constitute a breach of an international obligation there must have been a breach of a norm of international law in force at the time that the act or omission occurs.\n\n91.\n\nArticle 13 of the ILC Draft states:\n\n*International obligation in force for a State*\n\n*An act of a State does not constitute a breach of an international obligation unless the State is bound by the obligation in question at the time the act occurs.*\n\n92.\n\nIn its Commentary to Article 13 the ILC states that:\n\n*The evolutionary interpretation of treaty provisions is permissible in certain cases but this has nothing to do with the principle that a State can only be held responsible for breach of an obligation which was in force for that State at the time of its conduct.11*\n\n*Ibid,* p. 134, para. (9).\n\n93.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 arguments with respect to the relevance of prior events considered to be breaches of the Treaty posit a contradiction since, before the entry into force of the BIT, there was no possibility of breaching it. The Tribunal holds that it has Competence over events subsequent to the entry into force of the BIT when those acts are alleged to be violations of the BIT. Prior events may only be considered by the Tribunal for purposes of understanding the background, the causes, or scope of violations of the BIT that occurred after its entry into force.\n\n94.\n\nThe non-retroactivity of treaties as a general rule postulates that only from the entry into force of an international obligation does the latter give rise to rights and obligations for the parties. Therefore, for any internationally wrongful act to be considered as consummated, continuing, or composite, there must be a breach of a norm of international law attributed to a State.\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that the Claimants\u2019 allegations in respect of Ecuador\u2019s acts and omissions after the entry into force of the BIT serve to affirm the Competence of this Tribunal to determine whether there was a violation of the BIT independently of whether those acts or omissions were composite or continuing.\n\n96.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the existence of a breach of a norm of customary international law before a BIT enters into force does not give one a right to have recourse to the BIT\u2019s arbitral Jurisdiction. A case in point is the *Mondev v. United States of America* case in which the tribunal pointed out the difference between a claim made under a Treaty and a diplomatic protection claim for conduct contrary to customary international law.12\n\nThe Tribunal held that: \"Nor do Articles 1105 or 1110 of NAFTA effect a remedial resurrection of claims a Canadian investor might have had for breaches of customary international law occurring before NAFTA entered into force. It is true that Articles 1105 and 1110 have analogues in customary international law. But there is still a significant difference, substantive and procedural, between a NAFTA claim and a diplomatic protection claim for conduct contrary to customary international law\", *Mondev International LTD v. United States of America* (Mondev) (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award of October 11, 2002, available at http://www.state.gov/documents/organization/14442.pdf, para. 74.\n\n97.\n\nFor the above reasons, and in accordance with the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties, the Tribunal holds that the acts and omissions alleged by the Claimants as being prior to the entry into force of the BIT do not constitute continuing and composite wrongful acts under the BIT.\n\n**b. Obligation of parties signing the BIT to act in good faith: scope of application of Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Ecuador breached its obligation to act in good faith starting from the signing of the BIT. This argument is based on the wording of Article 18 of the Vienna Convention and on application of the principle set out in a passage from the *Tecmed* award characterizing the wording of Article 18 as an expression of the principle of good faith.13\n\n*Tecmed,* para. 70.\n\n99.\n\nArticle 18 of the Vienna Convention provides:\n\n*Obligation not to defeat the object and purpose of a treaty prior to its entry into force*\n\n*A State is obliged to refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of a treaty when:*\n\n*a) it has signed the treaty or has exchanged instruments constituting the treaty subject to ratification, acceptance or approval, until it shall have made its intention clear not to become a party to the treaty; or*\n\n*b) it has expressed its consent to be bound by the treaty, pending the entry into force of the treaty and provided that such entry into force is not unduly delayed.*\n\n100.\n\nWith reference to Article 18 of the Vienna Convention, the Claimants state that the Tribunal in *Tecmed* based its decision on the *Megalidis v. Turkey* case. The Claimants argue that the tribunal in *Megalidis,* applying customary international law, rejected Turkey\u2019s argument that it was not obliged to restore the property claimed because that obligation arose from the Treaty of Lausanne, which it had signed, but which was not yet in force.\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants also referred to the *Opel Austria v. Council of the European Union* case in which, according to them, the European Court of First Instance invoked the application of Article 18 of the Vienna Convention to establish the liability of the Council of the European Union when it imposed certain tariffs on Austrian products after having signed a treaty (but before ratifying it) that established the European Economic Area which prohibited the imposition of those tariffs.\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that the conduct of Ecuador after it had signed the BIT, and before the BIT had entered into force, amounted to a breach of its obligation to act in good faith imposed by Article 18 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n103.\n\nEcuador contends that Article 18 of the Vienna Convention cannot be invoked as the basis for the retroactive application of the BIT. Ecuador rejects the allegation in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial that when the BIT comes into force, its provisions produce effect from the time the parties signed the Treaty.\n\n104.\n\nEcuador argues that the obligation imposed upon the Contracting States by Article 18 of the Vienna Convention does not constitute an exception to the principle of the non-retroactivity of treaties, nor to the other norms of the Vienna Convention on the entry into force of treaties.\n\n105.\n\nEcuador contends that Article 18 only admits two exceptions expressly set out in the Vienna Convention on the provisional application of a treaty and the treaty provisions regulating the authentication of its text and other issues inevitably arising before the treaty enters into force.\n\n106.\n\nEcuador further contends that in the *Tecmed v United Mexican States* case the BIT between Spain and Mexico applied because there was an existing investment at the time the treaty entered into force. According to the Respondent, the tribunal ruled that its competence also extended to certain acts that took place before the BIT entered into force, provided such conduct or acts, upon consummation or completion of their consummation after the entry into force of the treaty, constitute a breach of the BIT. According to Ecuador, the approach taken by the tribunal in *Tecmed* does not involve or give rise to retroactive application of the BIT.\n\n107.\n\nEcuador argues that events occurring after the BIT entered into force did not give rise to rights in favor of the Claimants nor obligations on the part of Ecuador, given that those events do not constitute an investment, nor are they related to any investment that existed on the date when the BIT entered into force. Moreover, it contends that the dispute alleged by the Claimants is prior to the entry into force of the BIT.\n\n108.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that Article 18 of the Vienna Convention is an application of the principle of good faith to ensure that the object and purpose of a treaty are not defeated by acts or omissions of the Contracting Parties prior to its entry into force. The wording of Article 18 is not aimed at triggering the early application of the clauses of a treaty, that is, it does not warrant retroactive application of the treaty.\n\n109.\n\nThe precedents cited by the Claimants in support of their arguments have their own specific facts that distinguish them from the factual situations that are relevant in the present case.\n\n110.\n\nIn *Megalidis v. Turkey,* the Greek-Turkish arbitral tribunal in its award of July 26, 1928 held that the ownership of certain property, rights and interests of Megalidis were expropriated by Turkish authorities in August 1923, that is, shortly after the Treaty of Lausanne had been signed, but before it had entered into force.14\n\n*Aristotelis A. Megalidis v. Turkey,* 8 Recueil des Decisions des Tribunaux Mixtes (1927-1928).\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Treaty of Lausanne of July 24, 1923 applied to situations that arose, starting from October 29, 1914, having to do with property, rights and interests of nationals of Allied Powers that were still in existence on the date that the treaty entered into force and could be identified in the territories that continued to be Turkish.\n\n112.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that Article 65 of the Treaty of Lausanne created an obligation on the part of Turkey to restore certain properties, rights, and interests affected by consummated acts or omissions prior to the Treaty\u2019s entry into force. In other words, the Parties clearly intended this Article to have retroactive effect.\n\n113.\n\nThe Treaty of Lausanne contemplated a retroactive supplementary provision to facilitate performance of the required obligation of Turkey to restore those properties, rights, and interests that, at the date of signing of the Treaty, had already been liquidated by the authorities of the Contracting Parties.15\n\nTreaty of Lausanne, Article 66.\n\n114.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that the reference in the *Megalidis* case to the obligation of Contracting States to refrain from prejudicing a treaty or the validity of its clauses from the time it is signed to its entry into force was not the basis for the retroactive application of certain clauses of the Treaty. The Tribunal notes that the retroactive enforcement of the Treaty of Lausanne was the direct consequence of that tribunal\u2019s enforcement of the retroactive clauses of the treaty for purposes of determining the existence of an obligation on the part of Turkey to make reparation.\n\n115.\n\nWith regard to the other relevant case cited by the Claimants, the Tribunal notes that in *Opel Austria v. Council of the European Union* the Court of First Instance of the European Union held that the principle of good faith is a rule of customary international law which was codified in Article 18 of the Vienna Convention.16 The Tribunal notes that the application of Article 18 was based on the exceptional circumstances arising from the adoption of measures that contradicted and defeated the object and purpose of the treaty after it was signed and before it entered into force but after the treaty had been ratified and when a specific date had been set for its entry into force. The decision of that tribunal pointed to the fact that the tariffs prohibited under the treaty were imposed when the Contracting States had already deposited their instruments of ratification and a specific date set for the treaty\u2019s entry into force. Another relevant point was the allegation that the date of the measure imposed had been falsified.17\n\n*Opel Austria v. EU Council,* Case T-l 15/94; pg 1 [1997] All ER, 90, 97.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 94.\n\n116.\n\nIn the opinion of the Tribunal, the distinction between the extent of the obligation not to defeat the object and purpose of a treaty and the retrospective application of clauses of that treaty to situations prior to the date of entry into force of the treaty should not be confused. It has not been proven in the present case that the actions and omissions prior to the entry into force of the BIT and attributable to the Respondent had defeated the object and purpose of the Treaty. The case law precedents cited demonstrate, on one hand, that the retroactive enforcement of the treaty provisions were based on its own retroactive clauses: The other case demonstrates the extraordinary nature of the enforcement of the customary norm set out in Article 18 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n117.\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the fact that Article 18 of the Vienna Convention is an application of the general principle of good faith, it being understood that its scope is limited to not defeating the object and purpose of the treaty, and not to the retroactive application of its clauses.\n\n**c. Most-Favored-Nation Clause**\n---------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Article 11(1) of the BIT sets out the Treaty\u2019s aim to have limited retrospective effects. This Article gives recognition to the most-favored-nation clause (hereinafter referred to as the MFNC), which the Claimants associate with Article VII of the Argentina-Ecuador BIT.\n\n119.\n\nArticle 11(1) of the BIT provides as follows:\n\n*Each Party shall permit and treat investment, and activities associated therewith, on a basis no less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investment or associated activities of its own nationals or companies, or of nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the most favorable...*\n\n120.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 opinion, Article VII of the Argentina-Ecuador BIT grants to Argentine investors part of the protection offered by the Ecuador-United States BIT from December 1995. The Claimants contend that they are simply seeking the protection afforded by this Article.\n\n121.\n\nArticle VII of the 1994 Treaty between Argentina and Ecuador states:\n\n*Application of other rules*\n\n*If the provisions of the law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law existing at present or that are established in the future between the Contracting Parties in addition to this Treaty or if any Agreement between an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party contain rules, whether general or specific entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favorable than is provided for in this Treaty, such rules shall, to the extent that they are more favorable, prevail over this Treaty.*\n\n*(Tribunal\u2019s Translation).*\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimants contend that their claim under the MFNC is substantially different from that referred to by the claimant in the *Tecmed* case, as they are simply seeking the protection offered by a key clause of another BIT.\n\n123.\n\nIn interpreting the abovementioned Article VII, the Claimants contend that the reference made to treaties entered into *\"between the Contracting Parties\"* refers to Contracting Parties of treaties that had not yet entered into force, and not the Contracting Parties of the Argentina-Ecuador BIT.\n\n124.\n\nEcuador rejects the Claimants arguments on the scope of Article VII of the Treaty between Argentina and Ecuador as they are seeking to assert the retroactive effect of the BIT by invoking the MFNC.\n\n125.\n\nEcuador contends, following the precedent of the *Tecmed* case, that the clause cannot be invoked in the particular circumstances of the present case since the application of the investment treaty goes to the core of matters that must be deemed to be specifically negotiated by the Contracting Parties.\n\n126.\n\nEcuador contends that what Article VII states is simply that the rules of international law which may be established in the future \"between the Contracting Parties\" (Ecuador and Argentina) \"shall to the extent that they are more favourable, prevail over this Treaty.\" Thus, Ecuador concludes, there is no reason to incorporate the provisions of the Ecuador-United States BIT, nor does the Article deem its application to be retroactive.\n\n127.\n\nFrom the wording of Article VII of the Argentina-Ecuador BIT, the Tribunal concludes that, in accordance with the interpretation rules of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, the references made in the text of that Article to \"either Contracting Party,\" \"between the Contracting Parties,\" \"an investor of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party,\" and \"the other Contracting Party\" unquestionably refer to the Contracting Parties of the Argentina-Ecuador BIT.\n\n128.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal rejects the possibility of considering the application of the most-favored-nation clause, in the terms, and with the effects, claimed by the Claimants.\n\n**d. Acts prior to the entry into force of the BIT relevant in determining injury**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the events prior to the entry into force of the BIT are relevant in determining injury. Article 18 of the Vienna Convention as well as Article 13 of the ILC Draft do not limit the powers of a tribunal to examine events that occurred prior to the entry into force of a treaty for purposes of determining the extent of injury caused by the events that occurred after that date.\n\n130.\n\nIn their Memorial the Claimants allege that Ecuador had breached its obligations to negotiate in good faith at the Liquidation Commission and frustrated other dispute resolution attempts by relying on the arbitrary revocation of the operating permit of Seacoast\u2019s branch in Ecuador. The Claimants contend that the Tribunal must examine the contractual breaches occurring before the BIT came into force in order to determine the injury caused by these breaches.\n\n131.\n\nEcuador alleges that acts prior to the entry into force of the BIT cannot be invoked as violations of a treaty that had not yet generated obligations for the Contracting States. Consequently, neither can they be invoked for purposes of determining compensation for a non-existent wrongful act.\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimants\u2019 argument regarding the relevance of events occurring before the BIT entered into force in determining the injury caused is restricted to the ILC\u2019s Commentary on Article 13 *in fine* of its Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries.\n\n133.\n\nIn referring to the inter-temporality of law in ensuring that a State will only be found liable for breach of an obligation in force for a State at the time of the breach, the ILC commented:\n\n*Nor does the principle of the inter-temporal law mean that facts occurring prior to the entry into force of a particular obligation may not be taken into account where these are otherwise relevant. For example, in dealing with the obligation to ensure that persons accused are tried without undue delay, periods of detention prior to the entry into force of that obligation may be relevant as facts, even though no compensation could be awarded in respect of the period prior to the entry into force of the obligation.18*\n\nCrawford, J., *op. cit.,* p. 135.\n\n134.\n\nOn this matter the ILC also stated:\n\n*In cases where the relevant obligation did not exist at the beginning of the course of conduct but came into being thereafter, the \"first\" of the actions or omissions of the series for the purposes of State responsibility will be the first occurring after the obligation came into existence.*\n\n*This need not prevent a court taking into account earlier actions or omissions for other purposes (e.g. in order to establish a factual basis for the later breaches or to provide evidence of intent).19*\n\n*Ibid,* p. 144, para. (11).\n\n135.\n\nThis Tribunal, following the opinion of the ILC in its Commentaries on the customary norms set out in Articles 13, 14 and 15 of its Draft Articles on State Responsibility, will take into account events prior to the date of entry into force of the BIT solely in order to understand and determine precisely the scope and effects of the breaches of the BIT after that date.\n\n136.\n\nThe Tribunal reiterates its views on the possibility of exercising Competence over all acts or omissions alleged by the Claimants to have occurred after the entry into force of the BIT and as having been in violation thereof. Acts or omissions prior to the entry into force of the BIT may be taken into account by the Tribunal in cases in which those acts or omissions are relevant as background, causal link, or the basis of circumstances surrounding the occurrence of a dispute from the time the wrongful act was consummated after the entry into force of the norm that had been breached. The Tribunal, however, finds that it has no Competence to determine damages for acts that do not qualify as violations of the BIT as they occurred prior to its entry into force.\n\n**3. Subsidiary Objections**\n----------------------------\n\n**a. First subsidiary objection to the Competence of the Tribunal: existence of an investment**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n137.\n\nEcuador alleges that the Seacoast Contract does not fit the concept of investment as understood within the framework of the ICSID Convention. It states that it had not given its written consent to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration because when the BIT took effect beginning on May 11, 1997, the Claimants did not have any investment whatsoever, so that the treaty relied on in the claim to make up for the lack of express consent, is not applicable in this case. Ecuador alleges that the Seacoast Contract had expired in July 1996 and the Claimants had sold all their shares in Ecuapower in March 1997.\n\n138.\n\nEcuador contends that neither the ICSID Convention nor the BIT defines the actual meaning of the concept of investment. Ecuador admits that in the absence of a definition, case law has tended to give the term \"investment\" a broad interpretation. Nevertheless, it contends that no matter how broad the definition, it cannot go so far as to distort the meaning of the term itself. Ecuador argues, therefore, that for an investment to be deemed to exist in the terms of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, certain requirements must be present, such as that the project must have duration, the expectation of return or the obtaining of profits, the assumption of risks, the existence of a substantial commitment, and significance for the host State\u2019s development.\n\n139.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, in the Seacoast Contract the requirements of duration and shared risk do not exist. It is in fact a supply contract of uncertain duration, conceived as a response to a temporary emergency. The power generators were imported into the country under the temporary admission of imports regime. The supplier charges for the power it sells and the buyer pays for the power it buys. According to Ecuador, given that this transaction is purely commercial, it is excluded from the Jurisdiction of ICSID.\n\n140.\n\nEcuador contends that neither does the BIT contain a definition of \"investment.\" There has not been an intention to define the term with exactitude. The enumeration contained in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT continues to refer to the term \"investment\" by referring to relationships or property often included in the whole complex of operations known as investment.\n\n141.\n\nEcuador summarizes its position by stating that the list in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT in no way modifies its conclusions on the scope of the term \"investment\" in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Seacoast Contract expired before the entry into force of the BIT and after that date Seacoast had nothing but expectations in respect of a contractual claim that was neither recognized, nor could in any way be considered an investment under the ICSID Convention.\n\n142.\n\nEcuador contends, moreover, that the dispute concerning the Ecuapower Contract did not arise directly out of an investment. The Claimants\u2019 allegations concerning the intentional delays of the Ecuadorian officials in the signing of the contract between INECEL and Ecuapower and the alleged subsequent forced sale of the supposed interests of the Claimants in Ecuapower have no bearing on the matter and therefore do not arise directly out of any investment.\n\n143.\n\nEcuador argues that there is no connection between the Seacoast Contract and the Ecuapower Contract and that any transaction with the latter cannot amount to an intention, or offer, to renew the former. Ecuador was under no obligation to renew the Seacoast Contract. Ecuador contends that Seacoast and Ecuapower are two distinct legal entities, and hence the rights and obligations of one are not transferable to the other.\n\n144.\n\nEcuador alleges that Seacoast\u2019s operating permit cannot be deemed to be connected to an existing investment protected or covered by the BIT, nor can it be considered in itself as an investment. Ecuador moreover asserts that the revocation of Seacoast\u2019s operating permit cannot have any impact on its activities, since the company was not running any operation whatsoever and found it manifestly impossible to do so, having transferred all its assets to another company.\n\n145.\n\nFaced with the Claimants\u2019 allegation regarding the existence of an investment consisting of rights which they have against INECEL and the State at the time of entry into force of the BIT, Ecuador alleges that what really exists are mere claims, not rights. It asserts that in a bilateral relationship, a right does not exist simply because one of the parties claims it for itself. If the other party denies the very existence of the alleged right, what really exists is a claim, not a right. According to Ecuador, that fact was corroborated by Seacoast\u2019s filing of a claim on July 31, 1996, against INECEL before the Ecuadorian courts. Ecuador alleges that the substance of this claim and the reply submitted by INECEL unquestionably demonstrate that the existence of the alleged rights of Seacoast was not recognized by INECEL.\n\n146.\n\nEcuador referred to the events that occurred after the entry into force of the BIT, insofar as they are related in the claim, and relates them to three aspects (i) negotiations on the liquidation of the contract; (ii) negotiation aimed at resolving the dispute through arbitration; and (iii) revocation of Seacoast\u2019s so-called \"operating permit.\" According to Ecuador, none of these events constitutes an investment, therefore, the BIT is not applicable to the events that occurred after it entered into force.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, allege that when the BIT entered into force there was an investment in place under that Treaty and in this regard they contend that the Seacoast branch in Ecuador and its intangible assets qualify as investments under the broad definition of \"investments\" in the BIT. That is the definition applicable for purposes of complying with the provisions of the ICSID Convention.\n\n148.\n\nThe Claimants base their contention on the fact that ICSID tribunals have repeatedly interpreted the term \"investments\" in a broad sense when determining their jurisdiction. They cite as precedents the *Fedax v. Republic of Venezuela* and the *CSOB v. Slovakia* cases to affirm that the ICSID Convention does not limit the scope and extent of the term \"investments,\" which is also broadly defined in the BIT.\n\n149.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the BIT defines the investments that can be brought to ICSID. The decision on jurisdiction in the *Tokios Tok\u00e9les v. Ukraine* case is cited in support. In that case the tribunal found that as the ICSID Convention did not define the term \"investment\" the parties have a broad discretion to decide what transactions do or do not constitute an investment. Evidence of this discretionary power lies in the wording of the definitions accepted under the BIT. Thus, any transaction falling within the definition of \"investment\" under the BIT, also qualifies as an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Ecuador appears to confuse the relationship between the ICSID Convention and Article I(1)(a) of the BIT when, in order to determine the existence of an investment, it demands that certain requirements such as the existence of returns, a certain duration, risk, commitment and contribution to the economic development of the host State must exist. In any event, the Claimants argue that the requirements of duration and risk were present in the conception and design of the Seacoast project and investment in Ecuador.\n\n151.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, at the date on which the BIT entered into force there existed an investment in intangible assets, in an existing branch, and in other contractual rights against INECEL. Ecuapower acquired only Seacoast\u2019s power generating assets. Seacoast kept its rights concerning INECEL\u2019s commitment to negotiate a long term contract. The negotiations continued through the establishment of the Liquidation Commission and until the annulment of Seacoast\u2019s lawsuit in October 1999.\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimants allege that their investment falls within the definition of investment in the BIT. They contend that the Seacoast branch and its intangible assets qualified as investments under the BIT both before and after the sale of the power generating plants because: Seacoast had a contract; Seacoast had an operating permit; Seacoast had a branch that owned assets in Ecuador; and the BIT applies to investments existing at the time of its entry into force.\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Seacoast contract also qualifies as an investment under Article I(1)(a)(iii) and I(1)(a)(v). Under these provisions, a claim for money and any right conferred by contract are investments.\n\n154.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that Seacoast\u2019s operating permit falls within the definition of investment in the BIT. Article I(1)(a)(v) of the BIT describes \"any licenses or permits pursuant to law\" as investments. The granting and subsequent revocation of the permit were more than mere administrative acts because the Attorney General and the Civil Judge of Ecuador used the revocation of the permit as grounds to annul Seacoast\u2019s lawsuit and the Attorney General also used the revocation to refuse to sign the arbitration agreement that had been previously negotiated.\n\n155.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, their interests in Seacoast fall within the definition of investment under Article I(1)(a)(ii) of the BIT. The Claimants are the owners of the Seacoast branch in Ecuador. The branch owned rights in Ecuador against INECEL both under the Seacoast Contract and under the Clarification Contract. Seacoast actively pursued those rights through its legal representative\u2019s efforts at the Liquidation Commission to have Seacoast\u2019s accounts receivable paid, and also to manage Seacoast\u2019s lawsuit against INECEL.\n\n156.\n\nConsequently, the Claimants assert that, pursuant to Article XII(1), the BIT applies to investments in existence. Moreover, they allege that Article 1(3) confirms that any alteration of the form in which the assets are invested or reinvested shall not change their character as investments.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal reiterates that the main rules to be borne in mind for purposes of determining its own Competence in the present case are to be found basically in the ICSID Convention and in the Ecuador-United States BIT.\n\n158.\n\nArticle 25(1) of the ICSID Convention states as follows:\n\n*The Jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*\n\n159.\n\nFrom a simple reading of Article 25(1), the Tribunal recognizes that the ICSID Convention does not define the term \"investments\". The Tribunal notes that numerous arbitral precedents confirm the statement in the Report of the Executive Directors of the World Bank that the Convention does not define the term \"investments\" because it wants to leave the parties free to decide what class of disputes they would submit to the ICSID.20\n\n*Report of the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States,* 18/03/1965, 1 ICSID Reports, p. 28.\n\n160.\n\nThe BIT indicates in its Article 1 which investments are to be protected under it. Thus, the BIT complements Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, for purposes of defining the Competence of the Tribunal with respect to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment.\n\n161.\n\nArticle I of the BIT provides as follows:\n\n*1. For the purposes of this Treaty.*\n\n*(a) \"investment\" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes:*\n\n*(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;*\n\n*(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;*\n\n*(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment;*\n\n*(iv) intellectual property...;*\n\n*(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law;...*\n\n*3. Any alteration of the form in which assets are invested or reinvested shall not affect their character as investment.*\n\n162.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that the temporal requirements of Article XII of the BIT apply to investments existing at the time of its entry into force. The Tribunal therefore has to determine if *prima facie* the investment continued to exist upon entry into force of the BIT, as alleged by the Claimants.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that for purposes of determining if it has Competence it is sufficient to consider the events as alleged by the Claimants insofar and inasmuch as, if proven true, they would constitute a breach of the BIT.21 This statement does not preclude the right of the Respondent to question the occurrence of the alleged events for purposes of determining whether the Tribunal has Competence. However, any allegation about the scope of events alleged and the legal consequences thereof are matters that should be discussed when the Merits of the issues submitted are being analyzed and evaluated.\n\nConsistent with *Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Decision on Jurisdiction of September 25, 1983, 23 *ILM* 351 (1984), para. 38; Azurix Corp. *v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Jurisdiction of December 8, 2003, para. 76; *Pope & Talbot Inc. v. the Government of Canada,* para. 25; *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Decision on Jurisdiction of January 25, 2000, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/emilio\\_DecisiononJurisdiction.pdf, para. 69.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Article 1(a) of the BIT gives a broad definition of investment and that the rights and interests alleged by the Claimants to have subsisted as a consequence of the Seacoast project, after the entry into force of the BIT\u2014such as the intangible assets of accounts receivable, the existence of an operating permit\u2014would fit that definition.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal states that the requirements that were taken into account in some arbitral precedents for purposes of denoting the existence of an investment protected by a treaty (such as the duration and risk of the alleged investment) must be considered as mere examples and not necessarily as elements that are required for its existence. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the very elements of the Seacoast project and the consequences thereof fall within the characterizations required in order to determine the existence of protected investments.\n\n166.\n\nRegarding the events that the Claimants allege are breaches of the BIT by Ecuador, the Tribunal holds that as it is impossible to make distinction between the events that, if proven, would be breaches of the BIT, and those that, even if proven, would not constitute breaches of the BIT.\n\n167.\n\nConsidering that the Seacoast Contract was an investment prior to the entry into force of the BIT, the subsistence of that investment on the date of its entry into force should be taken into account. Additionally, the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties limits the application of the BIT and its clauses on jurisdiction to those disputes that are alleged to be violations of that Treaty after it entered into force.\n\n168.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that claims relating to the Seacoast Contract and the Clarification Contract, as well as the Ecuapower Contract, could not involve breaches under the BIT as the latter was not in force at the time that those alleged contractual breaches occurred. Applying the customary rules relating to State Responsibility, the contractual breaches prior to the entry into force of the BIT do not contain the elements necessary to amount to violations of the BIT.\n\n169.\n\nRegarding the events alleged by the Claimants to be breaches of the BIT after it entered into force, the Tribunal finds that the effects of an investment that was in existence before the treaty entered into force, continued, *prima facie,* after that date. The Tribunal, therefore, has Competence to hear the Claimants\u2019 arguments alleging breaches of the BIT by Ecuador for acts or omissions after it entered into force, which affected their investment.\n\n170.\n\nIt will fall to the Tribunal, in analyzing the arguments and the evidence of the Merits of the dispute, to determine whether the Claimants\u2019 allegations founded on Ecuador\u2019s breaches of the BIT by acts or omissions after it entered into force have, in fact, been proven to constitute breaches of the BIT.\n\n**b. Second subsidiary objection to the Competence of the Tribunal: the \"fork-in-the-road\" clause**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nEcuador alleges that the arbitration option under the BIT has been precluded, owing to the submission of the dispute to its domestic courts.\n\n172.\n\nEcuador maintains that pursuant to Articles VI(2)(a) and VI(3)(a) of the BIT, there had been consent to the \"fork-in-the-road\" option. That means that once a Jurisdiction has been chosen, it remains the forum, regardless of the results of the proceedings. According to Ecuador, once the claim had been submitted for resolution to the Ecuadorian administrative tribunals, the claiming party gives up the possibility of resorting to international arbitration; because once the national court option is chosen, this choice becomes definitive and irrevocable.\n\n173.\n\nEcuador alleges that the claims submitted by Seacoast before the Ecuadorian tribunals in 1996 are the same claims that serve now as the basis of the present claim, which have been submitted, for a second time, by the Claimants to an ICSID tribunal.\n\n174.\n\nIn support of its arguments, Ecuador maintains that the grounds for annulment of the claim submitted to the Ecuadorian tribunals arose after the submission of its claim; instead of objecting to the nullity plea, Seacoast accepted it in a letter dated October 15, 1999. The fact that Seacoast accepted the grounds for annulment would not prevent it from initiating a complementary action that could lead to a decision on the Merits.\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimants allege that they have not triggered the \"fork-in-the-road\" clause because the claim before the Ecuadorian tribunals involved different parties and different issues and that the claim was not a free election of forum and was annulled without a decision being made on the Merits.\n\n176.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the ICSID jurisprudence is consistent to the effect that a party to a dispute triggers the \"fork-in-the-road\" clause if the proceedings initiated involve the same parties, have the same issues and are based on the same cause of action. The Claimants cite the *Benvenuti v. Republic of the Congo* case which makes reference to the existence of *lis pendens.* They cite the *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic* and the *CMS v. Argentine Republic* cases. They allege that in the latter case the tribunal distinguished the fact that the claim before the domestic tribunals referred to contractual breaches whereas the claim before the ICSID referred to treaty breaches. They argue that the same reasoning was followed in numerous ICSID arbitration cases.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimants state that they were not parties in the proceedings before the Ecuadorian courts. The proceedings in the domestic courts and before the ICSID involve different causes of action and different issues. In the former, Seacoast sought damages for breach of contract; in the latter, the Claimants are seeking damages for breach of the BIT. Furthermore, the proceedings before the ICSID address actions taken by Ecuador before and after the entry into force of the BIT. Seacoast\u2019s claim before the Ecuadorian courts did not include claims for arbitrary and discriminatory acts on the part of Ecuador; for breach of promise to negotiate a long-term contract; for breach of the obligation to negotiate in good faith at the Liquidation Commission; for revocation of Seacoast\u2019s operating permit, for its refusal to agree to arbitration; and for annulling the claim presented to the domestic tribunals. The Claimants insist that they have not triggered the \"fork-in-the-road\" mechanism because the proceedings were ultimately annulled before the judge could make a decision on the Merits of the dispute.\n\n178.\n\nThe Claimants allege that they did not elect freely to initiate domestic legal proceedings. That decision was taken under pressure from the incoming Ecuadorian authorities in order to facilitate the parties reaching a settlement in the future. They cite the precedent of *Occidental v. Ecuador* in which the tribunal declared that the \"fork-in-the-road\" rule pre-supposes that the investor has made a choice between alternative avenues without any form of pressure. They allege that when the claim was presented to the Ecuadorian tribunals the possibility of making a choice of forum did not exist.\n\n179.\n\nIn response to Ecuador\u2019s allegation that mere submission of the suit to the domestic courts triggers the \"fork-in-the-road\" mechanism, the Claimants contend that the rule reflects the domestic and international law principle of *lis pendens.* According to the Claimants, the purpose of the principle is to ensure efficiency and avoid inconsistent decisions. The annulment of the proceedings in the local courts and Ecuador\u2019s contention that Seacoast may still present a claim to the Ecuadorian tribunals, do not, in the opinion of the Claimants, alter the effects of the *lis pendens* rule.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal takes due note of the fact that the Claimants\u2019 first submission to the ICSID, that is, the first request for arbitration, was in 1998, at which time the proceedings before the Civil Judge of Ecuador had not yet been annulled, which event occurred on October 21, 1999. Seacoast\u2019s consent to have the proceedings annulled took place after the first request for ICSID arbitration had been withdrawn.\n\n181.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that the \"fork-in-the-road\" rule is different from the *lis pendens* rule because the former rule refers to an option, expressed as a right to choose irrevocably between different jurisdictional systems. Once the choice has been made there is no possibility of resorting to any other option. The right to choose once is the essence of the \"fork-in-the-road\" rule.\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 allegation that the \"fork-in-the-road\" mechanism was not triggered because the proceedings were ultimately annulled without a decision on the Merits having been made by the judge, is not relevant for purposes of determining Jurisdiction because if there had been a right to choose an option and if that right had in fact been exercised that would in any case have been irrevocable, whether or not there had been a final decision on the Merits.\n\n183.\n\nThus, the submission of the Claimants as to why they did not again commence proceedings under Ecuadorian law after the nullity of the proceedings in 1999, is irrelevant for purposes of determining the issue of the triggering of the \"fork-in-the-road\" provision since, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants\u2019 arguments on the likely ruling of the Ecuadorian tribunal, when the submissions of the Attorney General are taken into account, are purely subjective speculation.\n\n184.\n\nIndependently of the foregoing observations, the Tribunal finds that Seacoast\u2019s claim before the Ecuadorian courts does not constitute the exercise of the \"alternative\" referred to in Article VI(2) of the BIT.\n\n185.\n\nArticle VI (2) of the BIT states:\n\n*In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution: (a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the* *dispute; or (b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or (c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.*\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that the claim before the Ecuadorian courts could never have been based on violations of the Treaty since the latter was not then in force, but was based instead on allegations of contractual breaches. Seacoast could not then exercise any choice under the BIT but commenced proceedings for breach of contract in the domestic court. The Tribunal notes that in the *Vivendi v. Argentine Republic* case on partial nullity it was inferred that having recourse to the domestic forum for breaches of contract does not involve exercising the right to choose an alternative under the BIT, unless the claim in the domestic forum is based on a breach of the BIT.22\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas de Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal* (previously CGE) *v. Argentine Republic,* Decision on Annulment, para. 55.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimants are aware that part of the dispute submitted to the ICSID had already been submitted to the Ecuadorian courts by Seacoast. Consequently, the Claimants recognized that they had no right of choice at that time, as the BIT was not in force.\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that in the proceedings commenced before the Ecuadorian courts, Seacoast claimed for contractual breaches under the Seacoast Contract and the Clarification Contract. On the other hand, the present action submitted to the ICSID by the Claimants is based on breach of contract and of the BIT and takes account of events before, as well as after, the submission of the claim to the Ecuadorian courts.\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Respondent\u2019s reliance on the Claimants exercise of the option of the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian courts is irrelevant in view of the special circumstances of the present case. Indeed, the Tribunal is of the view that the suits submitted by Seacoast to the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian Courts related to disputes that arose prior to the entry into force of the BIT. Thus, in accordance with the principle of the non-retroactivity of treaties, those disputes remain outside the temporal Competence of this Tribunal. It is not necessary to determine if a breach of the contract implies a breach of the BIT because the BIT was not in force and therefore, it did not give rise to obligations on the part of Ecuador on the date those disputes arose. Furthermore, the Respondent\u2019s invocation of the \"fork-in-the-road\" rule is also irrelevant with respect to the Claimants\u2019 allegations regarding acts and omissions of Ecuador constituting violations of the BIT after its entry into force.\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that it does not have Competence over disputes that arose prior to the entry into force of the BIT. The Tribunal confirms that it does have Competence over acts that are alleged by the Claimants to have given rise to disputes that arose or became evident after the entry into force of the BIT, independently of whether they had a causal link with, or served as the basis of, allegations concerning acts or disputes prior to the entry into force of the BIT.\n\n**4. Conclusions**\n------------------\n\n191.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Tribunal concludes:\n\n1. To allow the Respondent\u2019s main objections to the Tribunal\u2019s Competence in respect of the non-retroactivity of the BIT; and\n\n2. To reject the objections to the Tribunal\u2019s Competence with respect to the non-existence of an investment and the preclusion of the \"fork-in-the-road\" provision and consequently exercise its Competence over the Respondent\u2019s alleged violations of the BIT by acts or omissions after the entry into force of the BIT.\n\n**III. MERITS**\n---------------\n\n**1. INTRODUCTION TO THE MERITS OF THE DISPUTE**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nAfter conducting an exhaustive analysis of each of the arguments submitted by the Parties with respect to the matters on which it determined it had Competence, the Tribunal will refer here only to those arguments that it deems essential for determining the rights and obligations of the parties.\n\n193.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that its conclusions on Competence indicated in paragraph 191 above in no way pre-judge the rights and obligations of each of the Parties with respect to the issues that do not fall under the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal, and on which the Tribunal will express no opinion in this Award.\n\n**a. Relevant Facts**\n---------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimants, M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine Inc., are companies incorporated in the United States of America. They maintain that they own and control Seacoast, a company established in 1922 under the laws of the State of Texas, originally controlled by Briggs-Cockerham LLC.\n\n195.\n\nAgainst the background of an energy crisis in Ecuador in 1995, on November 17, 1995 the INECEL signed a contract with Seacoast for the sale of electricity for a period of six months (Seacoast Contract). Seacoast agreed to install and operate two electrical power generation plants in Santa Elena and in Santo Domingo (Ecuador), and sell that energy to INECEL.\n\n196.\n\nOn that same day, the parties signed a Memorandum of Clarification for the Execution of the Contract (Clarification Contract) relating to the scope of some of the clauses of the Seacoast Contract.\n\n197.\n\nAfter signing the Seacoast Contract, and for purposes of its execution, the owners of Seacoast decided to enter into a \"joint venture\" with three other American companies.\n\n198.\n\nThe \"joint venture\" brought together the Claimants in this arbitral proceeding, M.C.I. Power Group L.C. (hereinafter called MCI), and New Turbine Inc., as well as Old Dominion Electric Cooperative (hereinafter ODEC). New Turbine at that time operated under the name Energy Services Inc. (hereinafter called ESI).\n\n199.\n\nAt the end of 1995, MCI, ESI, and ODEC, as investors in Seacoast, established two limited companies under the laws of the State of Virginia, identified collectively in the Claimant\u2019s Memorial as Power Ventures. Power Ventures incorporated Power Services Ecuador Ecuapower Cia. Ltda (Ecuapower), as its subsidiary under the laws of Ecuador\n\n200.\n\nAt the beginning of 1996, differences arose between the Parties herein with respect to the execution of the Seacoast Contract relating to the date of commencement, the duration of the contract, the payment for energy under the \"Take or Pay\u2019 modality, reimbursement for the cost of fuel, and the imposition of fines and penalties.\n\n201.\n\nOn April 12, 1996 Seacoast suspended the operation of the two plants and delivery of power, invoking the non-payment by INECEL for invoiced amounts payable under the terms of the Seacoast Contract.\n\n202.\n\nOn May 26, 1996 INECEL declared the Seacoast Contract to be terminated, alleging the expiration of the agreed term of six months.\n\n203.\n\nIn June 1996, upon the original investors withdrawing from the \"joint venture,\" Seacoast and Ecuapower continued under the joint control of MCI, ESI, and ODEC.\n\n204.\n\nOn July 12, 1996, the Seacoast equity interests in power generation were transferred to Ecuapower.\n\n205.\n\nOn July 31, 1996, Seacoast submitted a claim against INECEL to the Administrative Court of the District of Quito requesting approximately 25 million U.S. dollars for damages for breach of contract.\n\n206.\n\nOn December 1, 1996, Seacoast\u2019s accounts receivable were sold to MCI, ESI, and ODEC, with Seacoast retaining the responsibility to recover the amounts claimed against INECEL.\n\n207.\n\nOn December 17, 1996, the shares of the MCI, ESI, and ODEC \"joint venture\" in Ecuapower were sold to a third party, the Anglo Energy Company.\n\n208.\n\nOn January 24, 1997, INECEL and Ecuapower signed a contract for the provision of electrical power for three years.\n\n209.\n\nOn April 7, 1997 the first meeting of the Liquidation Commission contemplated in the Seacoast Contract was held.\n\n210.\n\nIn 1998, ODEC transferred all the rights and interest that it had in the \"joint venture\" to MCI and ESI, these latter companies remaining as the only owners of the accounts receivable and other claims of Seacoast against Ecuador.\n\n211.\n\nOn February 8, 1999, the Superintendent of Companies by \"Nota\" Resolution. 99.1.2.1.00372 notified Seacoast of the revocation of its operating permit.\n\n212.\n\nOn March 31, 1999, the meetings of the Liquidation Commission were considered terminated.\n\n213.\n\nOn October 21, 1999 the Pichincha Civil Judge held that the claim submitted by Seacoast against INECEL was null and void.\n\n**b. The law applicable to the Merits of the issues raised**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the only law applicable in the present case is international law. They argue that the BIT includes an implicit agreement on the applicability of international law, and that the first part of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention must therefore be respected. They argue further that, if the Tribunal should consider that no such agreement exists, the force of the second part of Article 42(1) of the Convention is such that international law must be applied.\n\n215.\n\nEcuador argues that the law applicable to the disputes submitted by the Claimants is exclusively the domestic law of Ecuador, because that is the law agreed to by the parties for dealing with alleged default under the contract.\n\n216.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.*\n\n217.\n\nFrom the supporting documentation supplied by the parties during the proceedings, the Tribunal finds no evidence of any agreement on the law applicable to this dispute. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that it must respect the provisions of the second part of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, i.e., in the absence of an agreement, the Tribunal shall apply Ecuadorian law, including its rules of private international law and such rules of international law as may be applicable. With respect to the latter rules, the Tribunal finds that the rules contained in the BIT, as well as the other pertinent rules of general international law, are applicable in the present case. The Tribunal\u2019s Competence over the Merits of the disputes submitted is limited, in this respect, to considering the contentions of the Claimants relating to violation of the BIT after it came into force.\n\n218.\n\nIn the event of possible contradictions between the rules of Ecuadorian law and the BIT and other applicable rules of general international law, the Tribunal will decide on their compatibility, bearing in mind the contents and purpose of those rules in light of the precedence that international rules take over the domestic legislation of a State.\n\n**c. The relationship between INECEL and Ecuador**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimants contend that INECEL is an organ of the Ecuadorian State, directed and controlled by Ecuador through its government officials. The Claimants maintain that the object and functions of INECEL include those reserved generally to State regulatory bodies.\n\n220.\n\nAmong other points, the Claimants maintain that, upon liquidating INECEL, the Attorney General *(Procurador General)* became, by law, the State\u2019s representative with respect to all its rights and obligations.\n\n221.\n\nThe Claimants also insist that there is a contradiction in the Respondent\u2019s argument that INECEL enjoyed special prerogatives in the contracts it signed in its capacity as a State entity.\n\n222.\n\nEcuador contends that the BIT does not apply to the Seacoast contract because, among other reasons, that contract was not signed with the State but rather with INECEL, an autonomous entity that is legally independent of the State.\n\n223.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that a distinction must be drawn between the sovereign obligations assumed by the State and the commercial obligations assumed by INECEL under the Contract. It cites recent ICSID awards23 to the effect that not all defaults under a contract result in breach of the BIT.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award of May 12, 2005, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/CMS\\_Award.pdf, para. 269\u00a0and ss.; *Impregiio S.pA. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3), Decision on Jurisdiction of April 22, 2005, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/impregilo-decision.pdf, para. 220 y ss.\n\n224.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Ecuador accepts that INECEL was a public-sector agency and that official representatives or delegates constituted a majority of its board. It also recognizes that INECEL was empowered to exercise certain public powers. Nevertheless, Ecuador argues that, because it had a separate legal personality, its own capital, and autonomous management, INECEL must not be confused with the State.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that INECEL, in light of its institutional structure and composition as well as its functions, should be considered, in accordance with international law, as an organ of the Ecuadorian State. In this case, the customary rules codified by the ILC in their Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts are applicable. Therefore, any acts or omissions of INECEL in breach of the BIT or of other applicable rules of general international law are attributable to Ecuador, and engage its international responsibility.24\n\n*See,* International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Article 5.\n\n**2. ACTS ALLEGED AS BEING SUBSEQUENT TO THE ENTRY INTO FORCE OF THE BIT OVER WHICH THE TRIBUNAL HAS COMPETENCE**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimants allege, mainly, as breaches of the BIT subsequent to its entry into force, the bad faith and discrimination demonstrated by Ecuador in settling the disputes in question, through its acts and omissions in various areas. They allege, in the first place, the illegality, under the BIT, of the acts and omissions of INECEL within the Liquidation Commission stipulated in the Contract.\n\n227.\n\nIn the second place, the Claimants contend, because the procedures expected of the Liquidation Commission were frustrated, that they attempted to resolve the disputes in question through an arbitration agreement. According to the Claimants, Ecuador promised to sign an arbitration agreement but renounced their promise after Seacoast\u2019s operating license was revoked.\n\n228.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the revocation of that license was expropriatory. In addition, they argue that the revocation was used by Ecuador to provoke and obtain annulment of the only other possible route for the remedy of grievances, through a legal action before the Ecuadorian courts.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimants argue further that Seacoast and its legal representative were subject to constant harassment, as part of Ecuador\u2019s policy of discrimination against Seacoast.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal will consider each of these questions raised by the Claimants on the grounds that, in accordance with its conclusions on Competence, any act or omission attributable to Ecuador, subsequent to the BIT\u2019s entry into force, is in principle sufficient to constitute a breach of the BIT, and consequently engages the Jurisdiction of this Tribunal to consider the Merits of those claims.\n\n231.\n\nAfter analyzing these questions, the Tribunal will consider the contents and the scope of the BIT rules that the Claimants consider to have been violated by acts or omissions attributable to the Respondent, in order to evaluate the latter\u2019s legal position with regard to those rules.\n\n**3. ALLEGATIONS ON BREACHES OF THE BIT**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nThe Claimants base their position with respect to the issues over which the Tribunal decided to exercise Competence on the failure of the Respondent to comply with the obligations imposed by the BIT with respect to: (a) fair and equitable treatment; (b) no discriminatory or arbitrary treatment; (c) full protection and security; and (d) expropriation.\n\n**a. Fair and equitable treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Ecuador violated its obligation under the BIT to grant to the investors of the other contracting party treatment no less favorable than that required by the standards of international law. They cite Article 11(3)(a), which provides:\n\n*Investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law.*\n\n234.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that Article II(3)(a) sets out a minimum requirement upon States to provide treatment at least as favorable as that required by international law to investments of foreign investors. This international level of treatment includes fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\n\n235.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, ICSID jurisprudence confirms that the minimum standards of international law are independent of the domestic law of the State hosting an investment. On this point, they cite the award in the case of *Genin v. Estonia,25* in which the Tribunal held that \"under international law, the requirement of fair and equitable treatment is generally understood as a treatment that provides a basic and general standard which is different from the standards under domestic laws\". Examples of acts that violate this treatment would be \"a willful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards and even subjective bad faith.\"\n\n*Alex Genin et al. v. the Republic of Estonia* (Genin) (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/2), Award of June 25, 2001, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/genin.pdf.\n\n236.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the fair and equitable treatment required by the BIT includes the obligation to act in good faith. Good faith, according to the Claimants, is then an essential element of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n237.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the obligation to act in good faith implies respect for the basic assumptions on which the investor made the investment. They cite the award in the *Tecmed* case, where the Tribunal held that as part of those expectations are included that the State will conduct itself in a coherent manner, without ambiguity and transparently, in order for the investor to be able to plan its activities and adjust its conduct to the statutes or regulations that will govern them, the policies embedded therein, and relevant practices and administrative directives.26\n\n*Tecmed,* para. 154.\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that good faith has to do with legal security, in the sense that the investor must expect that the government will act in such a way that it may enforce its own rights. The State may not act capriciously to abuse the rights of investors and it may not obstruct access to an independent review when those rights have been violated.\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the requirement for fair and equitable treatment also protects investors from threats and other abuse of authority on the part of government officials. They refer to the conclusion of the tribunal in *Pope & Talbot,* with respect to an unjustified and invasive audit of the investor that was undertaken after a complaint was filed in the NAFTA system.27\n\n*Pope & Talbot,* Award on the Merits of Phase Two of April 10, 2001, para. 181, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Pope-Canada-Award-10Apr2001.pdf.\n\n240.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that violation of fair and equitable treatment includes abusive exercise of State powers, which may manifest itself through the malicious application of law. They cite in particular the tribunal that heard and decided the *Azinian v. United Mexican States* case, which held that there would be a fourth type of denial of justice, namely clear and malicious misapplication of the law.28\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian y Ellen Baca v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/97/2), Award of November 1, 1999, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/robert\\_award.pdf, para. 103.\n\n**b. No discriminatory or arbitrary treatment**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Ecuador is in breach of its obligation under the BIT not to treat them in a discriminatory or arbitrary manner.\n\n242.\n\nArticle II(3)(b) of the BIT provides:\n\n*Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.*\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimants maintain, following the precedent of the *Lauder v. Czech Republic* case, that the government has conducted itself arbitrarily if its act was not founded on reason or fact, or on the law.29\n\n*Ronald S. Lauder v. the Czech Republic,* Final Award of September 3, 2001, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Lauder-Czech-FinalAward-3Sept2001.pdf. para. 308.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the ruling of the International Court of Justice in the *ELSI* case, which defined an arbitrary act as a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.30 They cite arbitral precedents in which an arbitrary act on the part of government was defined as inequitable treatment, regardless of whether there was denial of justice.31\n\n*Case concerning Elettronica Sicula* (ELSI), Judgment, *ICJ Reports 1989,* available at http://www.icj-cij.org/dockct/filcs/76/6707.pdf. p. 76, para. 128.\n\n*Pope & Talbot,* para. 177-181; *Mondev,* para. 125.\n\n**c. Full protection and security**\n-----------------------------------\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Article II(3)(a) of the BIT refers expressly to the obligation of the contracting parties to grant full protection and security to the investors of the other contracting party.\n\n246.\n\nOn this point, the Claimants cite the case of *CME v. Czech Republic,* in which the Tribunal held that a government is only obliged to provide protection which is reasonable in the circumstances.32 They also cite, among other precedents, the case of *AAR v. Sir Lanka* Due diligence is nothing more nor less than the reasonable measures of prevention which a well-administered government could be expected to exercise under similar circumstances.33\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. v. the Czech Republic,* Partial Award of September 13, 2001, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/CME-Czech-PartialAward-13Sept2001.pdf. para. 353.\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. v. the Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3), Award of June 27, 1990, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/AsianAgricultural-SriLanka-FinalAward-27Junl990.pdf, para. 558.\n\n**d. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimants allege violation of article III(1) of the BIT, which provides:\n\n*Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (\"expropriation\") except: for a public purpose; in a nondiscriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article 11(3).*\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimants cite the definition of expropriation used by the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in the *Sola Tiles* case where it was indicated that a right cannot be affected through interference by a State in the use of the property or the enjoyment of its benefits amounting to a deprivation of the fundamental rights of ownership.34\n\n*Sola Tiles v. Iran* (1987), Iran US C.T.R., para. 29.\n\n249.\n\nCiting the decision in *Pope & Talbot,* the Claimants contend that, for a government act to be deemed an expropriation, that act must have substantially deprived the investor of his fundamental rights of ownership and disposal of property.35\n\n*Pope & Talbot,* Interim Award of June 26, 2000, paragraph 103, available at http://www.investmentclaims.com/decisions/Pope-Canada-InterimAward-26June2000.pdf.\n\n250.\n\nIn maintaining that the applicable law is Ecuadorian law, Ecuador rejects the application of the BIT or other international law to the issues raised by the Claimants. However, Ecuador recognizes the principles of fair and equitable treatment as an obligation contained within the minimum standards required by international law. It refers to the contents of customary international law in this matter, and its evolving nature, citing precedents in the cases of *Genin36 Mondev37 Azinian38* and *ELSI39* to conclude that none of the Claimants\u2019 arguments based on events subsequent to entry into force of the BIT exhibit the nature or the characteristics required to be deemed in international law as arbitrary or discriminatory, or to reflect bad faith or overt negligence, or in any way to fall short of the standards required by international law.\n\n*Genin,* para. 367.\n\n*Mondev,* para. 125.\n\n*Azinian,* para. 99, cited in *Mondev,* para. 126.\n\n*ELSI,* para. 128; cited in *Mondev,* para. 127.\n\n251.\n\nEcuador does not deny the scope of Article III of the BIT on expropriation, but rejects its application to the facts alleged by the Claimants.\n\n252.\n\nOn the basis of the positions taken by the Parties, the Tribunal notes that there is no discrepancy between them as to the contents of the rules invoked, but rather to their scope and effects with respect to the situations and circumstances of the points in dispute. The Tribunal will refer, first, to each of the Parties\u2019 contentions on the questions over which it has determined it has Competence. The Tribunal will then determine, for each contention and in the context of its circumstances and particular features, whether or not the BIT has been breached.\n\n**4. THE CLAIMANTS\u2019 CONTENTION OF LACK OF GOOD FAITH ON ECUADOR\u2019S PART WITH RESPECT TO THE ACTS AND OMISSIONS OF INECEL IN THE LIQUIDATION COMMISSION**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the Seacoast Contract and Ecuadorian legislation alike provide for the creation of a Liquidation Commission so that the parties may negotiate in good faith to resolve any disputes arising from execution of the Contract. They argue that the treatment granted by Ecuador to Seacoast in the Liquidation Commission was neither fair and equitable nor in good faith. Consequently, Ecuador has violated the rules both of customary international law and of Ecuadorian law and the Contract, by not acting in good faith during the liquidation process.\n\n254.\n\nClause 17 of the Contract provides that:\n\n*LIQUIDATION OF THE CONTRACT 17. 01. Once the term of this contract has expired, or if it has not been possible to continue with the relationship arising from this instrument, the parties shall prepare an act of liquidation, which shall contain a detailed account of the technical and economic aspects of the contract, recording the volume of power and energy supplied during the term, the values that INECEL has paid to the contractor, and those that have yet to be paid, those that must be deducted or refunded for any reason, with the appropriate adjustments. For this purpose, any compensation owing may be made. If there is no agreement on liquidating the contract, the parties shall proceed in accordance with Articles 87 and 88 of the Public Procurement Law, wherever applicable. This act of liquidation will be deemed as the act of delivery and receipt and must be signed by the representative of the contractor and in the name of INECEL, a commission appointed by the General Manager shall be present, constituted by the Operations Director of the SIN, the Director of Planning and Rates, and a technical expert who has not been involved in execution of this contract. The administrator of this contract shall appear as an observer, providing any appropriate information. If necessary, INECEL shall appoint other delegates to appear on its behalf at the signature of the act of liquidation stipulated in this clause.* *The members of the commission who, on behalf of INECEL, sign the act referred to in this clause shall have* *administrative, civil and criminal liability for the data and information contained therein.*\n\n255.\n\nThe Claimants interpret Clause 17 of the Contract as producing an obligation for the Parties to the Contract to negotiate in good faith with the object of resolving any dispute over enforcement and execution of the Contract.\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Seacoast accepted establishment of the Liquidation Commission on August 12, 1996, i.e. after the date on which it deemed the Contract to have expired. They argue that INECEL did not activate the Commission procedure as required in the Contract, until April 7, 1997, constituting a delay of almost seven months.\n\n257.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that Ecuador violated its contractual obligation to negotiate in good faith in the Liquidation Commission. They also argue that INECEL did not give Seacoast a reasonable explanation of its position, thereby demonstrating greater intransigence.\n\n258.\n\nThey also contend that, since December 1997, the Commission had remained inactive with respect to the claims submitted by Seacoast, and that it ceased to exist on or before March 31, 1999.\n\n259.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Liquidation Commission met approximately 11 times. While the Claimants affirm that at various meetings they accepted several of the demands of INECEL, they maintain that INECEL at no time recognized any claim submitted by Seacoast.\n\n260.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that a delegate of INECEL on the Liquidation Commission gave a promise that was never fulfilled. That promise was to request an opinion from the Attorney General as to the validity of the Clarification Contract, and Seacoast was to be permitted to examine and comment on the contents of the consultation document before it was sent.\n\n261.\n\nThe Claimants declare expressly that the Liquidation Commission was supposed to resolve differences over the term of the contract, over Seacoast\u2019s claims for unpaid invoices, and over the penalties imposed unilaterally on Seacoast by INECEL.\n\n262.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants cited the recognition by the Contract Administrator of the debts resulting from the failure by INECEL to pay for fuel.\n\n263.\n\nEcuador argues that the Liquidation Commission is not a mechanism for resolving disputes over the interpretation and enforcement of the Contract, but is rather a mechanism for settling outstanding accounts. Ecuador affirms that INECEL convened the first meeting of the Liquidation Commission. That commission was fully constituted on August 16, 1996 with the appointment of the Seacoast representatives subsequent to the date on which Seacoast understood the contract to have terminated.\n\n264.\n\nEcuador contends that INECEL did not activate the mechanisms stipulated in the Liquidation Commission because on August 28, 1996 it was notified of the lawsuit filed by Seacoast, from which it concluded that the differences over the Contract between the parties were now converted formally into a judicial dispute.\n\n265.\n\nEcuador also maintains that, as the judicial complaint remained inactive, it again moved for action in the Liquidation Commission in April 1997.\n\n266.\n\nEcuador complains of lack of transparency on the part of Seacoast for having presented itself at meetings of the Liquidation Commission as the holder of rights to accounts receivable deriving from the Contract, despite the fact that in December of 1996 it had sold those accounts to third parties. This lack of transparency, Ecuador argues, was an indicator of bad faith.\n\n267.\n\nEcuador maintains that Seacoast evidenced its intention to reject any settlement not based on the recognition of its judicial claims. Ecuador considers that the settlements proposed by the two parties constituted no more than a reiteration of their respective positions. It contends that the negotiations in the Liquidation Commission were called off at the request of Seacoast.\n\n268.\n\nEcuador denies the existence of any unfulfilled obligation allegedly assumed in the negotiations in the Liquidation Commission relating to a consultation to be addressed to the Attorney General on the scope of the Clarification Contract.\n\n269.\n\nEcuador also denies the Claimants\u2019 argument that in the Liquidation Commission the Contract Administrator recognized Seacoast\u2019s claim for unpaid fuel bills. Ecuador maintains that the Claimants were referring to a draft minute that was never agreed to by INECEL.\n\n270.\n\nEcuador asserts that those involved in the liquidation cannot assume the function of resolving disputes, and that neither party was authorized to impose its view of the liquidation on the other party.\n\n271.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that at the first meeting of the Liquidation Commission there was agreement on the issues that should be considered for liquidating the Contract. Among those issues were a series of questions over the differences arising prior to entry into force of the BIT, and relating to interpretation and enforcement of the Contract.\n\n272.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that there was no agreement on the divergent positions of each party with respect to the effects of the Clarification Contract, the date for initiation of the Seacoast Contract, and the date for its termination, nor with respect to the characteristic of the Contract as generating an obligation of \"Take or Pay\".\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that, with the entry into force of the BIT on May 22, 1997, the lack of agreement on outstanding questions became clear in the refusal to sign the minutes of any of the Liquidation Commission\u2019s meetings which took place after that date. Consequently, in December 1997, each party presented its own settlement proposal. According to Seacoast, the total amount owing from INECEL on November 30, 1997 was US$19,753,874. According to the settlement proposal prepared by INECEL, Seacoast owed it the amount of US$1,104,486.\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the Claimants\u2019 argument that final settlement or liquidation of the Contract produces its termination, as well as the Respondent\u2019s argument that liquidation is a post-contract stage, to be irrelevant for purposes of determining if there was a breach of the BIT, in light of the alleged lack of fair and equitable treatment and nondiscriminatory treatment on the part of Ecuador during negotiations within the Liquidation Commission subsequent to the BIT\u2019s entry into force.\n\n275.\n\nThe Tribunal interprets Clause 17 of the Contract as establishing a mechanism for liquidation of the Contract, once its term has expired. The Liquidation Commission is not intended to implement a dispute settlement mechanism. The intransigent positions of both parties during the Commission\u2019s meetings reflected the positions they took before the Ecuadorian courts. Clause 17 of the Contract provides the possibility to activate the remedies that are available to both parties in case of lack of agreement on liquidation.\n\n276.\n\nThe Tribunal finds no evidence from the actions of the Liquidation Commission that would prove or even suggest bad faith on the part of INECEL in not accepting Seacoast\u2019s claims.\n\n277.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the failure to agree on liquidation of the Contract was due to the prior existence of an unresolved dispute between the parties. The Claimants cannot base their claim of bad faith on the part of INECEL, and hence of Ecuador, on the Liquidation Commission\u2019s failure to recognize their claims.\n\n278.\n\nThe investor\u2019s expectations of fair and equitable treatment and good faith, in accordance with the BIT, must be paired with a legitimate objective. The legitimacy of the expectations for proper treatment entertained by a foreign investor protected by the BIT does not depend solely on the intent of the parties, but on certainty about the contents of the enforceable obligations.40\n\nSee *MTD Equity Snd. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile\u2014* Annulment Proceeding (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on Annulment of the *ad hoc* Committee of March 21, 2007, available at http://ita.law.uvic.ca/documents/MTD-Chile\\_Ad\\_Hoc\\_Committee\\_Decision.pdf, para. 67: \"The obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the applicable investment treaty and not from any set of expectations investors may have or claim to have. A tribunal which sought to generate from such expectations a set of rights different from those contained in or enforceable under the BIT might well exceed its powers, and if the difference were material might do so manifestly.\"\n\n279.\n\nConsequently, Seacoast\u2019s legitimate expectations as to the outcome of the negotiations in the Liquidation Commission cannot be disassociated from the scope and legal effects of the applicable rules, i.e. Clause 17 of the Contract. This clause does not give rise to an obligation to resolve existing disputes between the parties relating to the interpretation and application of the Contract. The fact that the parties did not achieve a definitive settlement at the Liquidation Commission could not give rise to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standards by Ecuador based on Seacoast\u2019s expectation, not based on a valid and binding obligation.\n\n280.\n\nLikewise, Ecuador was unable to substantiate or prove bad faith on the part of Seacoast on the grounds that it concealed information on its legal status as representative rather than owner of the contractual rights submitted to the Liquidation Commission.\n\n**5. REVOCATION OF SEACOAST\u2019S OPERATING PERMIT AND ITS EFFECTS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the revocation of Seacoast\u2019s operating permit was contrary to the fair and equitable treatment required by the BIT. They cite that revocation as grounds for claiming expropriation of their investment.\n\n282.\n\nAs a result of the revocation of that permit, the Claimants maintain that Ecuador violated its obligation to act in good faith, as part of fair and equitable treatment, with respect to the negotiations to reach an arbitration agreement to settle the outstanding differences.\n\n283.\n\nAlso as a result of that revocation, the Claimants maintain that Ecuador sought and obtained cancellation of judicial proceedings initiated by Seacoast before the Ecuadorian courts, contrary to its obligations to foreign investors protected by the BIT.\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal will now consider each of these arguments, beginning with that relating to revocation of the permit.\n\n**a. Revocation of the permit**\n-------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Seacoast had received a note from the Superintendent of Companies on February 8, 1999, notifying it that its permit was being cancelled because it was no longer conducting activities related to the business purpose for which it had been incorporated.\n\n286.\n\nWhile the Claimants admit that Seacoast was aware of some administrative problems with the operating permit, Seacoast did not realize that those problems had anything to do with its ability to assert its rights. Thus, according to the Claimants, Seacoast filed a petition on February 8, 1999 requesting that its operating permit be extended until the end of the process under way for reaching an arbitration agreement.\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that, according to Ecuadorian law, cancellation of the operating permit should have had no effect on the settlement of Seacoast\u2019s affairs, including the possibility of pursuing outstanding accounts receivable.\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimants clarified in their Reply that they are not challenging the power of the Superintendent of Companies to cancel the Seacoast permit, as according to Ecuadorian legislation they continued to have the legal capacity to liquidate their affairs. They maintain that the cancellation of the permit took on a new dimension with the effects it had on the negotiations for an arbitration agreement and on the judicial proceedings.\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the operating permit is a license to invest. They maintain that this license is in itself an investment and that its revocation therefore constitutes an expropriation.\n\n290.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that Seacoast\u2019s operating permit falls within the definition of investment of Article I of the BIT. Consequently, Ecuador\u2019s actions in cancelling that permit imply an expropriation according to the jurisprudence of international tribunals and courts. Citing the decision in the *Sola Tiles* case, as was argued by the tribunal that decided *Pope & Talbot,* the Claimants declare that Ecuador interfered with the rights flowing from Seacoast\u2019s operating permit, thereby interfering with Seacoast\u2019s rights of ownership when it revoked Seacoast\u2019s license, and then unlawfully relied on the revocation of the license to refuse to arbitrate and to reject Seacoast\u2019s judicial claim.\n\n291.\n\nEcuador contends that the operating permit cannot be considered an investment, since it has no economic or financial content in itself. Ecuador maintains that its revocation was legal and did not affect Seacoast\u2019s rights or those of the Claimants. Ecuador argues that Seacoast continued to be the owner of all its rights, excluding the accounts receivable that had been sold to the Claimants. What Seacoast could not do was to act through its legal representative in Ecuador, because its Ecuadorian branch was in the process of liquidation. Consequently, for Ecuador, this was a problem of representation and not one of ownership of rights.\n\n292.\n\nEcuador maintains that the operating permit is a simple certificate of domiciliation and is therefore inseparable from the establishment of the foreign company\u2019s branch in Ecuador. The operating permit bears no relation to the licenses, permits, or concessions to which the Claimants refer in their Reply. According to the Respondent, Ecuadorian law requires, for contracting with public-sector institutions, that a foreign company must be previously domiciled in Ecuador. Consequently, there is no requirement to obtain any permit or authorization. A foreign company may also conduct business in Ecuador through an agent, without the need to be domiciled.\n\n293.\n\nEven if such rights could qualify as an investment, Ecuador argues, revocation of the operating permit produced no permanent impairment of the investor\u2019s rights, a requirement for claiming expropriation.\n\n294.\n\nEcuador maintains that cancellation of Seacoast\u2019s operating permit was based, in accordance with the Companies Act, on the fact that the company had advised the Superintendent of Companies that it had no assets after July 12, 1996, and that consequently it had no operations of any kind in Ecuador.\n\n295.\n\nEcuador declares that the granting of an operating permit implies recognition by the Superintendent of Companies that a foreign company has a branch within Ecuadorian territory and that it is capable of conducting regular business in Ecuador; it is not a question of a State concession or a permit to exploit or make use of productive assets or State resources.\n\n296.\n\nEcuador argues that if Seacoast felt that the Superintendent\u2019s decision was unlawful or arbitrary, it could have appealed that decision to the Administrative Tribunal *(Tribunales en lo Contencioso Administrativo),* as provided by law, but it did not do so.\n\n297.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes, from the grounds cited in the Resolution of the Superintendent of Companies (Resolution 99.1.2.1.00374) revoking the Seacoast permit, that there is no element to justify qualifying that measure as a breach of fair and equitable treatment *per se* or as being an expropriation under the BIT.\n\n298.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the introductory clauses of the Resolution of the Superintendent of Companies stated that from the reports of the Directorate of Inspection and Audit it appeared that Seacoast Inc. was not carrying out activities related to the purposes of the company for which it had obtained an Ecuadorian domicile, as a result of which the branch was implicated in the reasons for the cancellation of the operating permit granted under Law 31 of the Company Law Reform Law.\n\n299.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that the operating permit is fundamentally related to the requirement to install, put into operation, and operate the electricity generating plants. At the time that the permit was revoked Seacoast had transferred its rights over the plants and was therefore not the owner, nor did it manage said plants.\n\n300.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that, in accordance with Article III of the BIT, and under general international law, among the requirements necessary for an expropriation there must definitely be a substantial interference on the part of the State that affects the use and enjoyment of the protected investment. Consequently, as there was no ownership of the investment relating to the installation and operation of the plants, the possibility of alleging a revocation of the operating permit as an expropriation is limited.\n\n301.\n\nThe facts cited in the introductory portion of the Resolution of the Superintendent of companies correspond with the information supplied by Seacoast to the Ecuadorian authorities. Seacoast was promptly informed of the Resolution and, while it requested an extension of its effects because Seacoast was negotiating an arbitration agreement, at no time was the Resolution contested by Seacoast.\n\n302.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal considers that Seacoast acquiesced in cancellation of the permit by not seeking an administrative review of the decision. The fact that Seacoast argues that it was not aware of the effects of the cancellation on the capacity of its legal representative to take action through the courts did not prevent it from appealing the order of the Fifth Court with respect to the effects of cancellation of the permit on the capacity to litigate in defense of its alleged rights or those of the persons it represented.\n\n303.\n\nAmong the legitimate expectations that Seacoast might invoke in arguing a violation of the fair and equitable treatment and good faith, the Tribunal cannot consider relevant the mere claim of ignorance of the legal effects of the revocation or of the existence of a remedy for challenging it.\n\n304.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants recognize the power of the Superintendent of Companies to revoke the permit. What the Claimants are challenging, in fact, is the effect that that revocation had on the negotiations for an arbitration agreement and on the annulment of the lawsuit initiated before the Ecuadorian courts. In this context, the Tribunal deems unfounded the claim that the revocation of the permit constitutes an expropriation.\n\n305.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal finds that the action of the Ecuadorian authorities in revoking Seacoast\u2019s permit to operate in Ecuador did not in itself constitute an act in conflict with domestic law or with the BIT. However, the legality of that revocation order does not authorize the Tribunal to prejudge the legality or illegality of its effects, in light of the obligations assumed by Ecuador through the BIT with respect to the consequences of that order for the negotiations concerning an arbitration agreement and on the annulment of the lawsuit.\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal will now examine these allegations of the Claimants with respect to the effects and scope of the revocation of Seacoast\u2019s operating permit.\n\n**b. The Claimants\u2019 allegation of Ecuador\u2019s bad faith in frustrating an arbitration process for resolving the questions at issue**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nWith the failure of the Liquidation Commission, the Claimants maintain that Ecuador reneged on its promise to submit the dispute to arbitration, and then obstructed judicial proceedings before the courts of Ecuador, thereby denying the possibility of resolving the dispute in any forum.\n\n308.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Seacoast had suggested to the Attorney General of Ecuador that there could be recourse to private arbitration under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. On this point, the Claimants contend that the Attorney General gave an official opinion, in a note dated January 29, 1999, that arbitration was the preferred way of proceeding to resolve the dispute.\n\n309.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, negotiations began in April 1999 and draft arbitration agreements were exchanged without reaching agreement on the content of an arbitration agreement.\n\n310.\n\nThe Claimants refer to a ninth draft of the arbitration agreement that, having been approved by the Attorney General in June 1999, was awaiting signature by the President of the Republic. They claim that in a meeting held in Washington on August 2, 1999, representatives of the Attorney General advised Seacoast that it was impossible to sign that agreement, because Seacoast\u2019s permit to operate in Ecuador had been revoked and it therefore no longer had legal standing.\n\n311.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that on August 13, 1999 the Deputy Attorney General *(Procurador General Subrogante)* sent a note to Seacoast confirming that signature of the arbitration agreement was not possible, because its operating permit had been cancelled.\n\n312.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants contend that although Seacoast had transferred the right to its accounts receivable, it continued to be responsible for collecting those accounts and was therefore the appropriate party to enter into the arbitration agreement.\n\n313.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants maintain that, contrary to the arguments of the Respondent, they did not consider that they had an assured right to resort to international arbitration. What they argued was the bad faith on the part of the Attorney General in reversing his position to conclude an arbitration agreement.\n\n314.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Seacoast made concerted efforts to obtain public support for reaching an arbitration agreement, but those efforts were in vain, in the face of Ecuador\u2019s opposition. Instead, the Claimants maintain, Ecuador responded by moving to annul Seacoast\u2019s lawsuit and initiating various proceedings against Seacoast and its representatives.\n\n315.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that, in light of this situation, Seacoast first considered resorting to ICSID arbitration, filing a Request for Arbitration against Ecuador on March 25, 1998. Seacoast then withdrew its claim on a \"without prejudice\" basis on April 17, 1998, and finally submitted a new claim.\n\n316.\n\nFor its part, Ecuador maintains that the State Attorney General considered that domiciliation of a foreign company was a prerequisite for signing an arbitration agreement. Ecuador argues that Seacoast had never revealed that it was a collection agent acting on behalf of third parties. If Seacoast, MCI and New Turbine had proceeded transparently, the revocation of Seacoast\u2019s operating permit, which was considered in this case a formal requirement for signing the agreement, could not have posed an obstacle to MCI and New Turbine, because it affected Seacoast exclusively, and only in its capacity to sign an arbitration agreement with the State at that time. Ecuador also contended that Seacoast was no longer the owner of rights to the accounts receivable to which the drafts of the arbitration agreement referred, because it had sold those rights, among others, to the Claimants in December 1996.\n\n317.\n\nEcuador contends that international law does not recognize a right to arbitration in the absence of the necessary consent of the parties involved in the dispute.\n\n318.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the only evidence provided by the Claimants with respect to an alleged promise by Ecuadorian officials to reach an arbitration agreement is the statement of the Seacoast representative, Charles Moseley, and in the e-mails he sent to other members of Seacoast on the feasibility, but not the certainty, of signing an agreement.\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the note from the Attorney General of January 29, 1999 was addressed to INECEL in response to a request for an opinion on the feasibility of arbitration. The contents of that note do not reveal any obligation to sign an arbitration agreement, but rather the possibility of such an agreement under Ecuadorian Law.\n\n320.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, in the note of August 13, 1999, the Attorney General included a copy of the Resolution of the Superintendent of Companies, No. 99.1.2.1.00374, dated February 8, 1999, reporting that the operating permit granted to Seacoast had been cancelled. The note stated that \"under the circumstances, it is not appropriate to proceed with arbitration, because of the effects of cancellation of the operating permit for the company\u2019s branch, and had that cancellation been known sufficiently in advance its petitions would not have been processed.\"41\n\nLetter No. 06767 of August 13, 1999 from Dr. Leonello Bertini Arbel\u00e1ez, Deputy State Attorney General *(Procurador del Estado Subrogante)* to Charles Moseley, Seacoast Inc., para. 5.\n\n321.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the alleged obligation of Ecuador to negotiate an arbitration agreement would be an obligation of means and not of result. If there was an intention, it was to negotiate the possibility of an arbitration agreement, not to reach an arbitration agreement. From the evidence produced before the Tribunal, there is no proof of bad faith on the part of the Attorney General in refusing to sign an arbitration agreement.\n\n322.\n\nSeacoast\u2019s expectations with respect to signature of an arbitration agreement cannot be based on any acquired right to reach that agreement as a consequence of an obligation assumed by Ecuador. The Claimants did not prove the existence of the obligation on the part of the Ecuadorian authorities to reach an arbitration agreement.\n\n323.\n\nUnder general international law, any obligation to submit for arbitration a dispute involving a State requires the existence of an agreement. That agreement, which may be verbal, must be proven by the party alleging it.42\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.pA. and Italstrade S.pA. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13), Award of January 31, 2006, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/SalinivJordanAward\\_IncludingAnnex.pdf, para. 70, \"It is a well established principle of law that it is for a claimant to prove the facts on which it relies in support of his claim - Actori incumbat probation.\"\n\n324.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the failure of the negotiations for an arbitration agreement did not violate the BIT standard of fair and equitable treatment, and hence did not engage Ecuador\u2019s responsibility for any expectations that Seacoast might have entertained for reaching such agreement.\n\n325.\n\nSeacoast could not ignore that the arbitration agreement implied for Ecuador the acceptance of an exception to the jurisdiction in favor of its courts for resolving the dispute existing at that time. Nor can the Claimants argue that they were unaware that the State was free to give or withhold its consent to bind itself through an arbitration agreement. All that could be proven in the present arbitration procedure was that Seacoast was firmly resolved to achieve this agreement, and that the Attorney General recognized the feasibility of such an agreement under Ecuadorian law. It has also been proven that there was no enforceable obligation on Ecuador\u2019s part to sign an arbitration agreement, but only to negotiate such an agreement. The Claimants recognize this in limiting their complaints to bad faith on the part of the Attorney General in the handling of the negotiations, and not the failure to fulfill an obligation of reaching an arbitration agreement. The mere possibility or intent of achieving an arbitration agreement did not in itself create an enforceable obligation for Ecuador, nor could Seacoast entertain a legitimate expectation on that basis, given the absence of an unfulfilled obligation to proceed steadily to signature of an arbitration agreement.\n\n**c. The annulment of the lawsuit**\n-----------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that revocation of Seacoast\u2019s permit was the pretext used by Ecuador to deny Seacoast any opportunity to resolve its dispute. Not only did Ecuador use this argument to set aside its promise to sign an arbitration agreement, but it also sought and obtained annulment of the lawsuit filed by Seacoast before the Ecuadorian courts. The Claimants assert that the lawsuit, which had been filed several years earlier, was the only remaining option that Seacoast had for resolving its contract dispute.\n\n327.\n\nSeacoast filed the lawsuit against INECEL on July 31, 1996, claiming approximately US$25 million in damages for breach of contract. The Claimants argue that the lawsuit was presented at the suggestion of the future Minister of Economy of Ecuador, for whom there could be no solution of the dispute unless Seacoast were to file a lawsuit before he took office.\n\n328.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, after INECEL responded to the lawsuit on September 25, 1996, the parties took no judicial action for more than two years. The Claimants maintain that Seacoast\u2019s primary interest was to exhaust remedies through the Liquidation Commission and then negotiate an arbitration agreement under the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n329.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, on August 7, 1999 the Attorney General made a submission to the Fifth Court in which he contended that cancellation of Seacoast\u2019s permit meant loss of its legal standing, and he claimed that the lawsuit had not been properly filed, because it lacked a signed authorization by the Seacoast representative.\n\n330.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that on September 1, 1999, Mr. Moseley notified the court of his position that cancellation of the permit did not imply the loss of Seacoast\u2019s legal standing. They contend however that, according to legal advice received by Seacoast, the alternative ground presented by the Attorney General for annulling the lawsuit, i.e. the absence of an authorizing signature, was technically valid.\n\n331.\n\nConsequently, on September 23, 1999 Seacoast asked the judge to determine whether the lawsuit had been validly lodged and whether Mr. Moseley continued to be Seacoast\u2019s legal representative. On October 15 Seacoast told the judge that it would accept a ruling of annulment based solely on inappropriate submission of the lawsuit by Seacoast\u2019s lawyers, but he did not admit that he had lost his powers of legal representation. Thus, Mr. Moseley, in a letter addressed to the judge, declared that, confirming the request in his previous letter, \"I expressly agree to such a ruling, and accept in advance your judgment, and would ask you to declare the lawsuit annulled as of the date it was submitted.\"43\n\nNote to Juez Quinto de lo Civil de Pichincha (Judge of the Fifth Civil Court of Pichincha) signed by Mr. Charles Moseley Hall and Yolanda Vinuesa, Esq. Mat. 1726-Quito, para. 3.\n\n332.\n\nOn October 21, 1999, the judge declared the lawsuit annulled as of the day of its presentation. In the Claimants\u2019 contention, that decision did not distinguish between annulment based on the technical arguments agreed to by Seacoast and annulment based on the Attorney General\u2019s objections over the continued legal standing of Seacoast\u2019s branch.\n\n333.\n\nThe Claimants argue that on October 10, 2002, the representative of the Attorney General appealed the judge\u2019s decision and that on December 12, 2002, the Superior Court of Justice of Quito declined jurisdiction because the Attorney General was not the party to have been detrimentally affected by the decision and had not reasoned its request for appeal.\n\n334.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants contend, contrary to Ecuador\u2019s position, that Seacoast had not agreed to withdraw the lawsuit on the basis of its lack of legal standing. Nevertheless, they recognized that Seacoast had agreed to withdraw the lawsuit on the basis of the absence of an authorized signature by its legal representative. The Claimants, however, consider that the judge\u2019s decision annulling the lawsuit was based on recognition of the two objections presented and argued by the Attorney General.\n\n335.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants recognize that they are not challenging the judge\u2019s decision to annul the lawsuit as a denial of justice, but rather as indicating bad faith on the part of the Attorney General in submitting formal objections to Seacoast\u2019s claim.\n\n336.\n\nFor its part, Ecuador maintained that on the date the BIT entered into force the Claimants had agreed that their claim against INECEL should be pursued through the local courts of Ecuador, which should decide on the Claimants\u2019 litigious and contingent rights, if any.\n\n337.\n\nIn Ecuador\u2019s view, the Ecuadorian judges did not issue any ruling on the pertinence of the Attorney General\u2019s argument as to the impact of the operating permit\u2019s revocation on continuation of the legal proceedings. Ecuador maintains that the judge\u2019s decision was based exclusively on the agreement of the parties.\n\n338.\n\nIn Ecuador\u2019s view, then, the cancellation of the legal proceedings came not as a consequence of revocation of the permit itself, but rather as a result of agreement among the parties, based on Seacoast\u2019s express acquiescence in the Respondent\u2019s petition. Cancellation of the legal proceedings, Ecuador argues, does not imply a denial of justice through an arbitrary court ruling.\n\n339.\n\nEcuador argues that in the worst of cases, revocation of the operating permit might have limited temporarily the agent\u2019s capacity for action, but not the right of the Claimants. MCI and New Turbine could have taken action directly, for which they would not have required either domicile or permits. In the same manner as they are pursuing this claim, they could by themselves have filed suit before the competent Ecuadorian courts. If they could do so, that means that their legitimate expectations, in keeping with the law, were in no way frustrated or limited by liquidation of Seacoast\u2019s branch in Ecuador.\n\n340.\n\nFrom the arguments and documentation supplied by the parties, the Tribunal notes that on March 23, 1999, as a result of liquidation of INECEL, the Attorney General\u2019s Office took over the defense in the judicial proceedings initiated by Seacoast.\n\n341.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, in the application of decisions regarding the administration of justice, the Administrative Tribunal that heard the case transferred it on April 12, 1999 to the Judge of the Fifth Civil Court of Pichincha.\n\n342.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the lawsuit filed by Seacoast challenged an official notice from the General Manager of INECEL in which he declared that the contract signed between Seacoast and INECEL on November 7, 1995 terminated on May 26, 1996. Seacoast also demanded payment for available energy, under the \"Take or Pay\" provisions of the Contract; payment for the fuel consumed, which INECEL had not settled; return of amounts improperly withheld as penalties imposed by INECEL; payment of interest; and payment of all damages sustained.44\n\nClaim submitted by Seacoast before the First District Tribunal of Quito for Administrative Disputes (First Chamber), July 31, 1996.\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that in its response to the lawsuit of September 25, 1996, INECEL addressed the issues put forward and invoked the absence of legal representation of Seacoast, and the absence of a signature by the legal representative of Seacoast.\n\n344.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the decision of the judge of the Fifth Civil Court of Pichincha was issued in the first ***considerandos*** of his Order, on Mr. Charles Moseley\u2019s lack of legal standing in the proceedings. In the later ***considerandos*** of that Order, the judge ruled: \"6) The last written submission [...] by Mr. Charles Moseley Hall, legal representative of Seacoast Inc. and of Seacoast Inc., Ecuador branch, in which he expressly acquiesces in the annulment requested by the Attorney General, is relevant; and 7) this legal situation noted in those ***considerandos*** means omission of one of the substantial formalities that must definitively influence the decision of the case, for which reason, on the basis of Article 355(3) of the Code of Civil Procedure, all proceedings are declared null and void, as of the date of submission of the suit, which may not be reinstated.\"45\n\nNumbers 6 and 7 of the decision of October 21, 1999, Fifth Civil Court of Pichincha.\n\n345.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal assumes that the Judge of the Fifth Civil Court of Pichincha ruled in favor of the objections brought by the Attorney General in his letter demanding annulment of the lawsuit presented by Seacoast.\n\n346.\n\nThe Tribunal finds a degree of confusion in the arguments advanced by the judge as to the effects of the revocation on the capacity of Seacoast\u2019s representative to take action before the courts. From the decision of the Judge of the Fifth Civil Court of Pichincha it appears that Mr. Moseley was not Seacoast\u2019s legal representative, and yet in sections 6 and 7 of that decision he accepted as valid Mr. Moseley\u2019s acquiescence with respect to the lack of signature on the claim for purposes of cancelling the proceedings. The Tribunal takes note of the fact that, if Mr. Mosley was no longer the legal representative of Seacoast, his acquiescence could not have produced a valid withdrawal of Seacoast\u2019s lawsuit.\n\n347.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of the appeal of the Order of the Judge of the Fifth Civil Court of Pichincha filed by the Attorney General on October 10, 2002.\n\n348.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that, on this appeal, the Superior Court of Justice of Quito ruled that the right of appeal lies with the person who has suffered irreparable harm as a result of the ruling. The court found that the ruling affected Seacoast Inc. and that it had not filed any appeal against the annulment ruling. Consequently, the court ruled that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal filed by the Attorney General.46\n\nDecision of the Superior Court of Quito in civil case No. 194-2000 filed December 12, 2000 by Seacoast against INECEL.\n\n349.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that the alleged legitimate expectations of an investor with respect to the behavior required of a host State cannot include merely subjective assessments as to the impossibility of achieving a viable solution through the State\u2019s domestic judicial remedies, when those remedies have not been properly pursued. Seacoast accepted cancellation of the lawsuit containing its claims over INECEL\u2019s contractual breaches and it did not challenge any portion of the justifications for the cancellation Order issued by the Ecuadorian judge with jurisdiction to settle the disputes in question. It is clear that Seacoast agreed to the cancellation of its lawsuit. Nor did Seacoast show any interest in investigating the possibilities of submitting a new claim on behalf of the owners of the rights that Seacoast had transferred, i.e. on behalf of the Claimants in the present case.\n\n350.\n\nIt is evident to the Tribunal that Seacoast, through its acts and omissions, desisted from the legal action it had initiated before the Ecuadorian courts. Nevertheless, that move did not prejudge the viability of future actions or recourses.\n\n351.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the fact that the injured party did not question the annulment ruling, even in part, and that it did not attempt to file a new claim does not prevent the Claimants from pursuing their asserted rights through the Ecuadorian courts.\n\n352.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the statements of the parties contained in the arbitration proceedings express, in specific circumstances, the recognition of a pre-existing obligation or create a new enforceable obligation of the other party. This was the case in *Joy Mining v. Egypt,* where the Tribunal decided that the respondent was obligated by the statement of its legal counsel, expressed during the oral hearing, that it would comply fully with the UNCITRAL proceeding agreed in the contract, and that the award would be the basis on which a decision would be taken to release, or not, the bank guarantee that was the object of the dispute.47 Similarly, the *Ad Hoc* Committee in the case of *CMS v. Argentina* decided to stay enforcement of the award on the basis of a statement by the respondent\u2019s agent committing the respondent to honor the annulment decision.48\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11), Award on Jurisdiction of August 6, 2004, available at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/joy-mining-award.pdf, para. 95.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Annulment Proceeding, Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (September 1, 2006), para. 49.\n\n353.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal interprets the Respondent\u2019s statements on the judicial remedies available in Ecuador49 as formal recognition that the Claimants have a right to appeal to the Ecuadorian courts. Consequently, the Claimants may file suit before the Ecuadorian courts with respect to all the disputes over which the Tribunal, in its Decision on Competence, decided that it did not have Competence.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Reply, para. 200.\n\n**6. ECUADOR\u2019S HARASSMENT OF SEACOAST REPRESENTATIVES**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that cancellation of the operating permit was part of a broader campaign by Ecuador to frustrate Seacoast\u2019s attempts to enforce its rights. They argue that, in the course of just a few weeks after petitioning for nullification of the lawsuit, Ecuador threatened Seacoast with a tax audit, began to investigate its legal representative, and opened judicial proceedings through a lawsuit submitted by the State-owned oil company.\n\n355.\n\nOn this point, the Claimants contend that on July 22, 1999, a few days after publication of their claims in the newspapers of Quito, the Ministry of Labor informed Seacoast that the dividends that should be paid to the employees must be distributed by March 31 each year, according to the Labor Code, and that failure to do so would result in penalties.\n\n356.\n\nThey also claim that a representative of the Ministry of Labor showed up unannounced at Seacoast\u2019s offices to inspect the documentation of two travel agencies\u2014 represented by Mr. Moseley and his wife\u2014 with which Seacoast shared offices, and that on August 8, 1999 a representative of the Social Security Office went to Mr. Moseley\u2019s home to investigate the labor relationship of his housemaid. They also argue that on August 16, 1999 the State oil company launched collection proceedings to recover penalties, although the dispute over the fuel charges was dormant, and that it gave notice a few days later it could seize its property.\n\n357.\n\nThe Claimants consider the threat of a tax audit of Seacoast to be part of this harassment.\n\n358.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that these events were not mere coincidence, but part of a policy of discrimination to which Seacoast had been subjected since first making its investment in Ecuador.\n\n359.\n\nThe Claimants summarize their argument by stating that, in the circumstances, after annulment of the lawsuit on October 21, 1999, Seacoast decided that further effort to pursue its claims in Ecuador would be fruitless. They maintain that, since the establishment of the Liquidation Commission in August 1996, Seacoast had been trying to resolve its contractual disputes with Ecuador in the Liquidation Commission, through the negotiation of an arbitration agreement and in the domestic courts, but that these efforts had proved unsuccessful.\n\n360.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that Seacoast reasonably believed that the government, by its responses in late July and early August 1999, was sending it a message that it was unwelcome in Ecuador and that it could not expect justice in its courts.\n\n361.\n\nFor its part, Ecuador argued that the exercise of State powers established by law for the enforcement of labor and fiscal obligations does not constitute persecution or harassment, since those measures can themselves be subjected to judicial review.\n\n362.\n\nWith respect to the tax audit requested by the Superintendent of Companies in its resolution declaring Seacoast\u2019s permit expired, Ecuador maintains that this constitutes compliance with a valid legal requirement. In turn, it denies the allegations that the activation of judicial remedies could be considered harassment.\n\n363.\n\nAs to the allegations of harassment by the Ecuadorian authorities concerning labor issues, a simple reading of the note of July 22, 1999 persuades the Tribunal that this was a routine notice from the Ministry of Labor, issued pursuant to Articles 105, 626 and 627 of the Labor Code. Article 105 sets the time limit for the payout of profits and imposes fines for nonobservance of that time limit, consistent with Article 626 of the Labor Code.\n\n364.\n\nAs to the Claimants\u2019 allusions to the visit of an inspector to the offices that Seacoast shared with two tourism agencies, and the visit of another inspector to Mr. Moseley\u2019s home, the Tribunal does not consider these visits to constitute significant evidence of systematic discrimination, because the Claimants\u2019 Memorial asserted that, a few days after those events, the Social Security Office issued a certificate to the effect that Seacoast had no outstanding obligations.\n\n365.\n\nWith respect to the threat of audits, the Tribunal finds that, in his note of August 13, 1999, the Attorney General referred to Seacoast\u2019s claims concerning its debts with the Internal Revenue Service (SRI). In that note, the Attorney General declared that \"the Resolution of the Superintendent of Companies orders that the Director General of the SRI be notified for purposes of a tax audit of the branch of Seacoast Inc. in Ecuador, which SRI will perform immediately for the fiscal years 1996, 1997 and 1998, including the sale of Seacoast\u2019s equity interests in Ecuapower, and the transfer of the associated assets.\"50\n\nLetter No. 06767 of August 13, 1999 from Dr. Leonello Bertini Arbel\u00e1ez, Deputy State Attorney General (Procurador del Estado Subrogante) to Charles Moseley, Seacoast Inc.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the audits mentioned in the Resolution of the Superintendent of Companies of February 1999 represent a routine procedure related to revocation of the permit. From the information contained in that Resolution, no unfair or inequitable, arbitrary or discriminatory treatment can be inferred that would violate the standards of general international law required by Article II(3)(a) of the BIT. Moreover, the documentation supplied by the parties offers no proof that those audits were conducted or, if they were, that they violated those standards of international law.\n\n367.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal finds that the claim by the State oil company for unpaid debts does not constitute a discriminatory or arbitrary act. From a simple reading of the note claiming those payments, the Tribunal considers that this demand falls within the normal and routine activity of public administration. Moreover, the mention of a possible embargo for default on debts due and payable flows from existing legislation. The documentation supplied by the parties provides no evidence that the debt was executed or that embargoes were constituted that might have affected the Claimants\u2019 rights to fair and equitable treatment under the BIT.\n\n368.\n\nAs to the Claimants\u2019 assertions that Seacoast believed it could not obtain justice through the Ecuadorian courts, the Tribunal considers that such subjective assessments point to a certain degree of negligence in Seacoast\u2019s decisions concerning the eventual resolution of its disputes.\n\n369.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that fair and equitable treatment conventionally obliges States parties to the BIT to respect the standards of treatment required by international law. The international law mentioned in Article II of the BIT refers to customary international law, i.e., the repeated, general, and constant practice of States, which they observe because they are aware that it is obligatory. Fair and equitable treatment, then, is an expression of a legal rule. Inequitable or unfair treatment, like arbitrary treatment, can be reasonably recognized by the Tribunal as an act contrary to law.51\n\n*Tecmed,* para. 102.\n\n370.\n\nIn this sense, fair and equitable treatment cannot be confused with the application of the rule of *ex aequo et bono,* which presupposes the broad exercise of discretion by arbitrators in seeking a solution to a dispute. In the *Mondev* case, the tribunal held that:\n\n*...Article 1105(1) did not give a NAFTA tribunal an unfettered discretion to decide for itself on a subjective basis, what was 'fair' or 'equitable' in the circumstances of each particular case.... The Tribunal is bound by the minimum standard as established in State practice and in the jurisprudence of arbitral tribunals. It may not simply adopt its own idiosyncratic standard of what is 'fair' or 'equitable', without reference to established sources of law.52*\n\n*Mondev,* para. 119\n\n371.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the acts alleged by the Claimants as continuing harassment by Ecuador against Seacoast may betray an unfriendly attitude but, when evaluated individually or as a whole, they do not constitute unfair or inequitable, discriminatory or arbitrary treatment in violation of the parameters established by international law as reflected in the BIT.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n372.\n\nOn the basis of reasonableness and prudence, the Tribunal, having no valid grounds to depart from precedent and general trends on the assessment of costs and expenses incurred in arbitration proceedings, considers that each party should pay its own costs and expenses for legal representation and that the parties should each pay half of the costs and expenses incurred by the Centre with regard to the present arbitration proceedings, both on Jurisdiction and on the Merits.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n373.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides:\n\na. To allow the Respondent\u2019s main objections to the Tribunal\u2019s Competence in respect of the non-retroactivity of the BIT;\n\nb. To reject the other objections to the Tribunal\u2019s Competence and consequently exercise its Competence over the Respondent\u2019s alleged violations of the BIT by acts or omissions after the entry into force of the BIT;\n\nc. To reject the Claimants\u2019 claims on which the Tribunal previously decided that it had Competence, for it considers that the Claimants have failed to prove violation of the standards of fair and equitable treatment, including the obligation to act in good faith, or the standards of non-discriminatory or non-arbitrary treatment that the BIT requires of Ecuador as a State party.\n\nd. To reject the Claimants\u2019 claim relating to the expropriation of their rights to the investment as a result of revocation of Seacoast\u2019s permit to operate in Ecuador.\n\ne. To formally take note of the statements of the Respondent\u2019s attorneys as to the Claimants\u2019 right to take judicial action before the Ecuadorian courts to settle the outstanding disputes over what they allege to be contractual breaches.\n\nf. Each party shall bear in equal portions the costs and expenses incurred in the arbitration proceedings on Jurisdiction and on the Merits.\n\ng. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred for legal representation in the arbitration proceedings on Jurisdiction and on the Merits."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2009-10-19T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn November 26, 2007, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (*ICSID* or *the Centre)* received from M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine Inc. (jointly referred to as *the Applicants)* an application for the partial annulment of the Award rendered on July 31, 2007 (hereinafter *the Award)* by the Arbitral Tribunal in the arbitration proceeding between M.C.I.

Greenberg, Q.C., (Canadian); and Professor Jaime Irarrazabal (Chilean). The Application for Annulment was submitted within the time period provided for by Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States of March 18, 1965 *(Washington Convention* or *the Convention).*\n\n2.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application for Annulment on December 6, 2007 and on the same date transmitted the Notice of Registration to the parties, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings *(the Arbitration Rules).*\n\n3.\n\nBy letter of April 7, 2008, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified by the Centre that the *ad hoc* Committee *(the Committee)* composed of Judge Hans Danelius (Swedish), Judge Dominique Hascher (French), and Judge Peter Tomka (Slovak), had been constituted and that the annulment proceeding had begun on that date. The parties were also notified that Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee. By letter of April 11, 2008, the parties were notified that the Members of the *ad hoc* Committee had designated Judge Dominique Hascher as the President of the Committee. On May 15, 2009, Ms. Natali Sequeira, Counsel, ICSID, was assigned as new Secretary of the Committee.\n\n4.\n\nThe First Session of the Committee and the parties was held at the offices of the World Bank in Paris on May 16, 2008. During the Session the Committee and the parties discussed a number of procedural matters, including the schedule for the written pleadings. It was also agreed that the annulment proceeding would be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force since April 10, 2006.\n\n5.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed schedule, the Applicants filed their Memorial on Annulment on August 15, 2008, and the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Annulment on November 24, 2008. At the request of the Applicants, and with the Respondent\u2019s agreement, the Committee granted a 21-day hiatus (from December 15, 2008 through January 2, 2009). The filings of the parties were accordingly postponed. The Applicants filed their Reply on February 6, 2009 and the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on April 27, 2009.\n\n6.\n\nThe Hearing on Annulment took place at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. on June 8, 2009. The Applicants were represented by Mr. Barry Appleton, Mr. Martin Endicott, Appleton & Associates International Lawyers; Mr. Edward Mullins, Astigarraga Davis Mullins & Grossman, P.A.; Mr. Frank Borowicz, QC, Mr. Ivor Massey, and Mr. Richard Gorman. The Respondent was represented by Dr. Diego Garc\u00eda Carri\u00f3n, *Procurador General del Estado,* Dr. Alvaro Galindo Cardona, Dr. Luis Felipe Aguilar, Procuraduria General del Estado; Mr. Alberto Wray, Mr. Ernesto Alb\u00e1n, Ms. Paola Delgado, Ms. Ver\u00f3nica Arroyo, Cabezas & Wray; Mr. Paul S. Reichler, Mr. Ronald Goodman, Ms. Paz Z\u00e1rate and Ms. Clara Elena Brillembourg, Foley Hoag, L.L.P.\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nM.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine Inc. are legal entities of the United States of America (U.S) which own and control Seacoast, Inc. *(Seacoast),* also a U.S. entity, which on November 17, 1995 entered with the Instituto Ecuatoriano de Electrificaci\u00f3n *(INECEL),* a state organ of Ecuador,1 into a Contract *(Seacoast Contract)* for the sale of electricity and also a Memorandum of Clarification for the Execution of the Contract *(Clarification Contract),* relating to the scope of some of the clauses of the Seacoast Contract.\n\nAward, para. 225: *\"The Tribunal finds that INECEL, in light of its institutional structure and composition as well as its functions, should be considered, in accordance with international law, as an organ of the Ecuadorian State. In this case, the customary rules codified by the ILC in their Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts are applicable. Therefore, any acts or omissions of INECEL in breach of the BIT or of other applicable rules of general international law are attributable to Ecuador, and engage its international responsibility\"*\n\n8.\n\nFor purposes of the execution of the Seacoast Contract, M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine Inc. (at that time operated under the name of Energy Services Inc. *(ESI))* entered into a \"joint venture\" with Old Dominion Electric Cooperative *(ODEC).* At the end of 1995, MCI, ESI and ODEC, as investors in Seacoast, constituted two companies under the laws of the State of Virginia, collectively identified during the original arbitration proceeding as *Power Ventures.* Power Ventures incorporated Power Services Ecuador Ecuapower Cia. Ltda. *(Ecuapower),* a local subsidiary constituted under the laws of Ecuador.\n\n9.\n\nAs early as the beginning of 1996, the parties encountered differences with the execution of the Seacoast Contract relating to the date of commencement, the duration of the Contract, the payment for energy under the \"take or pay\" clause, the reimbursement for the cost of fuel and the imposition of fines and penalties.\n\n10.\n\nOn April 12, 1996, Seacoast suspended the operation of the plants and delivery of power, invoking the non-payment of invoiced amounts payable under the Seacoast Contract. On May 26, 1996, INECEL declared the Seacoast Contract terminated.\n\n11.\n\nOn July 12, 1996, the Seacoast equity interests were transferred to Ecuapower and on July 31, 1996, Seacoast submitted a claim before the Administrative Court of the District of Quito against INECEL, challenging the termination of the Contract and requesting the payment of approximately US$ 25 million of damages for breach of contract. The case was transferred on April 12, 1999 to the Judge of the Fifth Civil Court of Pichincha who held on October 21, 1999 that the claims submitted by Seacoast against INECEL were null and void due to the lack of standing of Seacoast's legal representative. The Superior Court of Justice of Quito decided on December 12, 2000 that it lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal filed by the Attorney General.2\n\n*Id.,* paras. 341-348.\n\n12.\n\nPending judicial proceedings, the Liquidation Commission contemplated by Article 17 of the Seacoast Contract was established in August 1996. It held its first meeting on April 7, 1997 on the differences relating to the interpretation and enforcement of the Contract but, due to the intransigent positions of the parties, ceased to hold its meetings on or before March 31, 1999.3\n\nparas. 256, 258, 263, 271-275.\n\n13.\n\nOn December 1, 1996, Seacoast's accounts receivable were sold to M.C.I., New Turbine and ODEC (subsequently ODEC transferred all its rights to M.C.I, and New Turbine in 1998), with Seacoast retaining responsibility to recover the amounts claimed against INECEL4. INECEL signed a contract with Ecuapower on January 24, 1997 after M.C.I., New Turbine and ODEC had sold their shares in Ecuapower to a third party (The Anglo Energy Company).\n\n*Id.,* paras. 194-213.\n\n14.\n\nOn December 16, 2002, M.C.I, and New Turbine started an ICSID arbitration against the Republic of Ecuador. M.C.I and New Turbine claimed having invested in Ecuador both before and after the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment *(the U.S.-Ecuador BIT* or *the BIT)* entered into force on May 11, 1997. They affirmed that the Tribunal was required to apply the provisions of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT to the actions and omissions of Ecuador that harmed Seacoast after the signature of the BIT on August 27, 1993. They further argued that the Republic of Ecuador had breached its BIT obligations by continuous and composite acts. M.C.I, and New Turbine declared that the Republic of Ecuador acted in a manner inconsistent with Article 11(3)(c) of the BIT5 in that its actions and omissions constituted a failure to observe its contractual obligations. They claimed that the Republic of Ecuador breached the BIT through the actions of INECEL, its state organ, which did not observe its contractual obligations. In this regard, they alleged that the Republic of Ecuador failed to abide by the \"take or pay\" obligation because INECEL failed to pay Seacoast for the energy capacity of the plants, that the Republic of Ecuador failed to respect the duration of the Contract, unjustifiably imposed penalties, failed to pay fuel charges necessary to generate electricity and to fulfill the Liquidation Commission obligation in good faith. They further claimed that the Republic of Ecuador failed to negotiate the renewal of the Contract, yet immediately renewed it on even more favorable terms as soon as an Ecuadorian national bought the company. They claimed USS 24,242,784 million as damages and interest from the initial Contract as well as losses from the failure to renew the Contract.\n\nArticle 11(3)(c) of the BIT provides that: *\"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments. \"*\n\n15.\n\nM.C.I, and New Turbine also submitted that the Republic of Ecuador had breached the BIT through the actions of its Cabinet of Ministers which interfered with the Seacoast Contract and with Seacoast's ability to enforce its contractual rights. They pointed out that the Republic of Ecuador granted more favorable treatment to Ecuadorian nationals and their investments, breached its obligation to protect the Claimants' legitimate expectations in refusing to pay sums clearly due under the Contract and that they were forced to mitigate their damages by selling their interests in the power plants to the brother of the Ecuadorian Undersecretary of Energy and Mines. M.C.I, and New Turbine argued that the Republic of Ecuador had frustrated Seacoast's pursuit of its contractual remedies, first before the Liquidation Commission, then under a promised arbitration agreement, and finally in the Ecuadorian courts, when it obtained annulment of the lawsuit filed by Seacoast because of the cancellation of Seacoast's operating permit. They submitted that the Republic of Ecuador had acted in a manner inconsistent with Articles II(1)6 and 11(3)(a) and (b)7 of the BIT in that such acts and omissions constituted a breach of its national treatment obligation, a failure to provide treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security, as well as a failure to provide treatment free from arbitrary and discriminatory conduct. M.C.I, and New Turbine also submitted that the Republic of Ecuador had acted inconsistently with Article III of the BIT in that its actions or omissions in expropriating Seacoast's contractual rights by its final refusal to pay at the Liquidation Commission in December 2007 and revoking Seacoast's operating permit constituted a taking of Seacoast's interests in property without just compensation and in violation of the international law standards of treatment required by Article 11(3)(b) of the BIT.\n\nArticle 11(1) of the BIT provides that: *\"Each Party shall permit and treat investment, and activities associated therewith, on a basis no less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investment or associated activities of its own nationals or companies, or of nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the most favorable, subject to the right of each Party to make or maintain exceptions falling within one of the sectors or matters listed in the Protocol to this Treaty. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party before or on the date of entry into force of this Treaty of all such laws and regulations of which it is aware concerning the sectors or matters listed in the Protocol. Moreover, each Party agrees to notify the other of any future exception with respect to the sectors or matters listed in the Protocol, and to limit such exceptions to a minimum. Any future exception by either Party shall not apply to investment existing in that sector or matter at the time the exception becomes effective. The treatment accorded pursuant to any exceptions shall, unless specified otherwise in the Protocol, be not less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments and associated activities of nationals or companies of any third country\"*\n\nArticle 11(3) of the BIT provides that: *\"(a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law. (b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a party has had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party\"*\n\n16.\n\nThe Republic of Ecuador raised objections to the jurisdiction of the ICSID Tribunal. It declared that the BIT has no retroactive effect and in support of its argument submitted that Article 18 *(Obligation not to defeat the object and purpose of a treaty prior to its entry into force)* of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties may not be used to impose specific norms of the BIT retroactively in violation of Article 28 *(Nonretroactivity of treaties)* of the same Convention, that the most-favored nation clause in other investment treaties cannot be invoked as a basis for the retroactive application of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT and that there is no internationally wrongful continuing or composite act. It contended that, at the time when the BIT came into force, the Claimants had no investments in Ecuador because the Seacoast Contract was terminated in May 1996 and they had sold their interests. The Republic of Ecuador added that the accounts receivable do not qualify as an investment under Article 25 of the Washington Convention. The Republic of Ecuador also alleged that had the BIT been applied, the arbitration option of the BIT would have been foreclosed because the Claimants had already presented their claim to an Ecuadorian court. In the event that the BIT was applicable, the Republic of Ecuador pleaded that the Claimants had not proved that it breached any of its obligations arising from that Treaty and even less that such breach occurred after the Treaty had entered into force.\n\n17.\n\nIn its Award of July 31, 2007 the Arbitral Tribunal decided:\n\n\"a. *To allow the Respondent's main objections to the Tribunal's Competence in respect of the non-retroactivity of the BIT;*\n\n*b. To reject the other objections to the Tribunal's Competence and consequently exercise its Competence over the Respondent's alleged violations of the BIT by acts or omissions after the entry into force of the BIT;*\n\n*c. To reject the Claimants' claims on which the Tribunal previously decided that it had Competence, for it considers that the Claimants have failed to prove violation of the standards of fair and equitable treatment, including the obligation to act in good faith, or the standards of non-discriminatory or non-arbitrary treatment that the BIT requires of Ecuador as a State party.*\n\n*d. To reject the Claimants' claim relating to the expropriation of their rights to the investment as a result of revocation of Seacoast's permit to operate in Ecuador.*\n\n*e. To formally take note of the statements of the Respondent's attorneys as to the Claimants\u2019 right to take judicial action before the Ecuadorian courts to settle the outstanding disputes over what they allege to be contractual breaches.*\n\n*f. Each party shall bear in equal portions the costs and expenses incurred in the arbitration proceedings on Jurisdiction and on the Merits.*\n\n*g. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred for legal representation in the arbitration proceedings on Jurisdiction and on the Merits.\"*\n\n18.\n\nThe Applicants request annulment of the Award for the alleged failure of the Arbitral Tribunal to *\"[a]ddress the Claimants' US$ 24.2 Million claim that Ecuador breached the Ecuador-US BIT through its failure to pay accounts receivable that it owes to the Claimants - whether on a continuous basis or otherwise\".* In the alternative, they request that *\"the Committee annul for manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons the Tribunal's implicit decision that it had no jurisdiction over the treaty aspects of the claims under Article VI(1)(c) of the Ecuador-US BIT on the basis that it involved a dispute arising before the Treaty came into force.* Finally, and in any event, they request that *\"the Committee annul for manifest excess of powers and failure to state reasons the Tribunal's decision that it had no jurisdiction over contractual aspects of the claim under Article VI(1)(a) of the Ecuador-US BIT on the grounds that it involved a dispute that arose before the Treaty came into force \"8*\n\nApplicant\u2019s Memorial on Annulment *(Memorial),* para. 150.\n\n19.\n\nIn their Application for Annulment, the Applicants sought partial annulment of the Award on two grounds, set out in paragraphs (b) and (e), out of the five grounds provided for in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. The relevant parts of Article 52 read as follows: *\"Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds: [...] (b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers; [...] (e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\"*\n\n20.\n\nInitially, the Applicants presented their request for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the Washington Convention as an alternative to annulment under Article 52(1)(e) and dependent on a finding that the Tribunal was considered to have implicitly dealt with the issue of the accounts receivable. Subsequently, the Applicants, when answering a question from the Tribunal, specified that they do not require a specific finding regarding Article 52(1)(e) of the Washington Convention as a precondition to annul the Award under Article 52(1)(b) and that their allegations relating to sub-paragraphs (b) and (e) of Article 52(1) are independent from each other. The Applicants also clarified at the hearing that they are finally seeking full annulment of the Award because the Tribunal\u2019s excess of power contaminated the whole award9. The Committee will first review its powers under Article 52 of the Convention. It will then turn to the grounds invoked by the Applicants in the order in which they are set out in Article 52.\n\nTranscripts of the Annulment Hearing held on June 8, 2009 (hereinafter referred to as Tr.), pp. 193, 199.\n\n**III. THE COMMITTEE\u2019S POWERS UNDER ARTICLE 52 OF THE WASHINGTON CONVENTION**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A) PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS**\n---------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Applicants argue that the Committee should exercise wide discretion to annul the Award. They also point out that the grounds for annulment under Article 52 are not mutually exclusive. They refer to the Annulment Committee decision in *MTD v. Chile* which noted that *\"annulment committees have a role to perform within the ICSID system in ensuring 'the fundamental justice of the arbitral process\u2019\"10* and to the decision of the Committee in *Klockner (I)* which also noted that the ICSID system and rules of the Convention are designed to prevent *\"in one of the parties an impression of injustice.\"11*\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on Annulment, March 21, 2007, 13 ICSID Reports 516, para. 54 (hereinafter referred to *as MTD v. Chile).*\n\n*Klockner Industrie-Anlagen GmbH and others v. United Republic of Cameroon and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Camerounaise des Engrais,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2), Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, 2 ICSID Reports, para. 78 (hereinafter referred to *as Kl\u00f4ckner (I)).*\n\n22.\n\nThe Applicants consider that, if not annulled, the decision of the Tribunal would gravely compromise the coherence and legitimacy of bilateral investment treaties and the ability of ICSID tribunals to properly resolve BIT disputes. Moreover such a decision would create a divide between international investment law and well-settled international law on the point of the retroactive application of treaties and create false and dangerous precedents.12\n\nThe Applicants give an example of an award which cites with approval a certain passage from the M.C.I. Power Award, *i.e.* the award rendered in *V\u00edctor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2), May 8, 2008, para. 611 (hereinafter referred to as *Pey Casado v. Chile).*\n\n23.\n\nThe Republic of Ecuador contends that the Applicants are attempting to have the Committee act as though it were faced with an appeal and not only examine the Tribunal's conclusions with respect to the meaning and scope of applicable law but also reexamine the facts. Such an aim is foreign to the nature of annulment proceedings and violates the provisions of Article 53 of the Convention under which the award is binding on the parties and *\"not be subject to any appeal.\"13*\n\nArticle 53(1) of the Washington Convention.\n\n**B) ANALYSIS OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE:**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nIt appears clearly from Article 53 of the Washington Convention that the only permissible remedies against an award are those provided for in the Convention, which include a request for annulment but not an appeal. *Ad hoc* committees are therefore not courts of appeal. Their mission is confined to controlling the legality of awards according to the standards set out expressly and restrictively in Article 52 of the Washington Convention. It is an overarching principle that **ad hoc** committees are not entitled to examine the substance of the award but are only allowed to look at the award insofar as the list of grounds contained in Article 52 of the Washington Convention requires.14 This was reaffirmed by many committees, whose decisions are relied upon by the parties.15 Consequently, the role of an **ad hoc** committee is a limited one, restricted to assessing the legitimacy of the award and not its correctness. The committee cannot for example substitute its determination on the merits for that of the tribunal and, as the *Lucchetti v. Peru* Committee emphasized: \"*[...] it is no part of the* *Committee's functions to review the decision itself which the Tribunal arrived at, still less to substitute its own views for those of the Tribunal, but merely to pass judgment on whether the manner in which the Tribunal carried out its functions met the requirements of the ICSID Convention.\"16*. The annulment mechanism is not designed to bring about consistency in the interpretation and application of international investment law. The responsibility for ensuring consistency in the jurisprudence and for building a coherent body of law rests primarily with the investment tribunals. They are assisted in their task by the development of a common legal opinion and the progressive emergence of *\"une jurisprudence constante\",* as the Tribunal in *SGS v. Philippines* declared.17\n\nThe *Klockner (I)* Committee already explained that Article 52 *\"is in no sense an*  *appeal* *against arbitral awards\"* and that *\"[t]his provision permits each party in an ICSID arbitration to request annulment of the award on one or more of the grounds listed exhaustively in the first paragraph of Article 52 of the Convention.\" Klockner (I),* Decision on Annulment, May 3, 1985, 2 ICSID Reports 97, para. 3 (emphasis in the original).\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v.

Philippines).*\n\n25.\n\nIn their submissions, the parties have relied on the arbitral jurisprudence of ICSID and other investment tribunals, even though according to Article 53 of the Washington Convention the award is only binding on the parties to the dispute. It does not constitute a binding precedent on other tribunals.18 Nevertheless, an increasing number of awards and decisions of tribunals and annulment committees are published by ICSID with the parties' consent, as required by Article 48(5) of the Washington Convention and Rule 48(4) of the ICSID Rules. As a result, the reporting of cases and the commentaries of scholars and practitioners are extensive and undeniably promote the consistent application of investment law. The parties in the present case have also relied on past decisions of *ad hoc* committees which are referred to in this decision. Although there is no hierarchy of international tribunals, as acknowledged in *SGS v. Philippines,19* the Committee considers it appropriate to take those decisions into consideration, because their reasoning and conclusions may provide guidance to the Committee in settling similar issues arising in these annulment proceedings and help to ensure consistency and legal certainty of the ICSID annulment mechanism, thereby contributing to ensuring trust in the ICSID dispute settlement system and predictability for governments and investors.\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n**IV. ARTICLE 52(1)(b): MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**A) PARTIES' SUBMISSIONS:**\n----------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Applicants contend that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law of the dispute by improperly refusing jurisdiction over the accounts receivable claim under the BIT. Although it recognized the accounts receivable as an investment under Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT,20 the Tribunal failed to address how the BIT, once it came into force, applied to the accounts receivable. The Applicants assert that jurisdiction over the accounts receivable is obvious from a review of Articles VI(4)21 and XII22 of the BIT which together grant the Tribunal jurisdiction over \"any investment dispute\" in relation to an investment existing at the time of entry into force of the BIT. Pursuant to Article XII of the BIT, the Treaty certainly applied to a situation which clearly did not cease to exist when the BIT took effect on May 11, 1997 and the Applicants point out that, from the Tribunal's own findings, it appears that the disputes arising out of the investment agreements actually went on long after the Treaty entered into force.\n\nArticle I(1)(a) of the BIT provides: *\"I. For the purposes of this Treaty, (a) ''investment'' means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes: (i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, lions and pledges; (ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof; (iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment; (iv) intellectual property which includes, inter alia, rights relating to: literary and artistic works, including sound recordings; inventions in all fields of human endeavor; industrial designs; semiconductor mask works; trade secrets, know-how, and confidential business information; and trademarks, service marks, and trade names; and (v) any right* *conferred by law or contract, and any license and permits pursuant to law.\"*\n\nArticle VI(4) of the BIT provides: *\"Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for: (a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and(b) an \u2018agreement in writing' for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958 (New York Convention').\"*\n\nArticle XII of the BIT provides:  \n*\"I. This Treaty shall enter into force thirty days after the data of exchange of instruments of ratification. It shall remain in force for a period of ten years and shall continue in force unless terminated in accordance with paragraph 2 of this Article. It shall apply to investments existing at the time of entry into force as well as to investments made or acquired thereafter. 2. Either Party may, by giving one year's written notice to the other Party, terminate this Treaty at the end of the initial ten year period or at any time thereafter. 3. With respect to investments made or acquired prior to the date of termination of this Treaty and to which this Treaty otherwise applies, the provisions of all of the other Articles of this Treaty shall thereafter continue to be effective for a further period of ten years from such date of termination. 4. The Protocol and Side Letter shall form an integral part of the Treaty.\"*\n\n27.\n\nThe Applicants point out that, unlike other Ecuadorian and U.S. BITs, the U.S.-Ecuador BIT does not limit the temporal scope of the term *\"investment dispute\"* defined at Article VI(1) of the BIT.23 The Applicants compare the language of Article VI(1) with that of other BITs such as the Argentina-Spain BIT, the Panama-U.S. BIT and several other Ecuador BITs which contain specific clauses precluding their application to disputes arising prior to their entry into force. The absence of such temporally limited language in the U.S.-Ecuador BIT indicates in their opinion that the Contracting Parties did not intend to limit the temporal application of the Treaty in the way decided by the Tribunal. They further underline that Article XII of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT which prevents a tribunal from taking jurisdiction over disputes that have ceased to exist before the BIT came into force, is similar to that of the Honduras-U.S. BIT which has been explained by the U.S. Secretary of State as confirming that the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties simply prevents a tribunal from taking jurisdiction over disputes with respect to acts occurring before the treaty came into force, or to situations ceasing to exist before that time, but not from taking jurisdiction over a dispute arising before the treaty came into force, so long as the underlying cause of the dispute continued or otherwise culminated past that date. The Applicants also add that the U.S.-Ecuador BIT is not written only in the future tense, in particular Article VI(1) to (3).24 The Applicants conclude that neither Ecuador nor the United States included an implicit limitation on their consent to ICSID jurisdiction to disputes arising after the U.S.-Ecuador BIT came into force.\n\nArticle VI(1) of the BIT provides: *\"I. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged broach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\"*\n\nArticle VI(2) and VI(3) of the BIT provides: *\"2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution: (a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or (b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or (c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.*  \n*3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration: (i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u2018Centre) established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\u2018ICSID Convention), provided that the Party is a party to such Convention; or (ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or (iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), or (iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute, (b) Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.\"*\n\n28.\n\nThe Applicants argue that as a result of its erroneous interpretation of the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties, the Tribunal failed to apply Article VI(4) of the BIT through which the Contracting Parties agreed to submit to binding arbitration *\"any\"* investment dispute unmodified by the express temporal restrictions that appear in other BITs. They state that the Tribunal adopted a principle of treaty interpretation which overrides the express wording of Article XII of the BIT and abrogates the Treaty itself and runs counter to the most fundamental rule of treaty interpretation set out in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.25 They contend that in such case the misinterpretation of the treaty is so grave that the distinction between ignoring the law and interpreting it incorrectly breaks down.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the Vienna Convention: *\"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\"*\n\n29.\n\nThe Applicants next assert that, in addition to failing to apply the terms of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by citing no authority in support of its false legal conclusion that the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties prevented it from taking jurisdiction over disputes arising before the U.S.-Ecuador BIT came into force. The Applicants state that the Tribunal relied solely and exclusively on Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties26 even though nothing in Article 28 prevents a tribunal from taking jurisdiction over disputes arising before a treaty comes into force, provided they do not cease to exist before such time. The Applicants argue that the Tribunal's incorrect statement of law finds no support in the International Law Commission commentary to Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the drafting history of the Washington Convention,27 the position adopted by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Mavrommatis* case,28 commentaries by legal scholars, including the President of the International Court of Justice,29 State treaty practice30 and investment treaty jurisprudence. The Applicants in particular state that *Mondev v.* *United States31* and other awards such as *UPS v. Canada32* and *SGS v. Philippines33* accepted jurisdiction over disputes that arose before the relevant treaty came into force and are not at all consistent with the erroneous ruling of the Tribunal. The Applicants distinguish the facts of the present case from the factual situation in *Lucchetti v. Peru34* or in *Jan de Nul v. Egypt,35 Pey Casado v. Chile,36* and *Tradex v. Albania37* and the determination of the Tribunal on the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties from the findings in *Impregiio v. Pakistan38* and *Salini v. Jordan.39* There is no justice, they argue, in a process through which an unsupported and arbitrary reference to a non-existent rule of law is used to resolve a dispute.\n\nArticle 28 of the Vienna Convention: *\"Non-retroactivity of treaties: Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty with respect to that party.\"*\n\nArticle 25(1): *\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising out of an investment, between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre...\"*\n\n*\"The Court is of the opinion that, in case of doubt, jurisdiction based on an international agreement embraces all disputes referred to it after its establishment [...] The reservation made in many arbitration treaties regarding disputes arising out of events previous to the conclusion of the treaty seems to prove the necessity for an explicit limitation and, consequently, the correctness of the rule of interpretation enunciated above,\"* Case of the Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions, PCIJ (1924) Series A, No. 2, p. 35 (hereinafter referred to as *Mavrommatis).*\n\nStanimir Alexandrov, \"The \u2018Baby Boom\u2019 of Treaty-Based Arbitrations and the Jurisdiction of ICSID Tribunals,\" 4 Laws and Practice of Int'l Courts and Tribunals 19; Lauterpacht, \"The Development of International Law by the International Court\" (1958, Stevens & Sons); J.

The Applicants underline that there are two types of investment disputes at issue in their claim. The first is an investment dispute arising under Article VI(1)(c)40 which is a dispute over an alleged violation of the terms of the BIT. The second is a dispute arising under Article VI(1)(a)41 of the BIT, which is a dispute over the Seacoast Contract. They later specified in the Reply Memorial that there are two separate channels at issue, namely the BIT and the Contract, for resolving one dispute.\n\nArticle VI(1)(c) of the BIT provides: *\"For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to [...] (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\"*\n\nArticle VI(1)(a) of the BIT provides: *\"For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company [...].\"*\n\n31.\n\nThe Applicants submit that since contractual disputes must be resolved in accordance with the proper law of the contract or otherwise by customary international law (or the law of the host State), as opposed to the substantive provisions of the BIT, such disputes, so long as they continued to exist after the treaty entered into force, are unconstrained by the temporal limitations of the BIT which apply to Article VI(1)(c) but not to Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT. The Applicants assert that, based on normal treaty interpretation principles, the Tribunal has competence over the contractual claims because it is entirely irrelevant for the purpose of the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Article VI(1)(a) whether the act took place before or after the BIT entered into force so long as the dispute continued after its entry into force. Article VI(1)(a) cannot confine the Tribunal to applying the substantive provisions of the BIT which are temporally limited. Unlike Article VI(1)(c), Article VI(1)(a) functions in their view as a purely jurisdictional provision unrelated to the substantive provisions of the BIT. The Applicants argue that the Tribunal had an obligation to scrutinize its jurisdiction under all paragraphs of Article VI but, unfortunately, failed to do so. Because of its failure to apply the terms of the BIT, the Tribunal also failed to apply the proper law over the contractual aspect of the dispute to the alleged breaches of the umbrella clause of Article 11(3) of the BIT which would have applied to the dispute regardless of when the Treaty entered into force. The Applicants conclude that the refusal to assume jurisdiction under the terms of the contract amounts to adopting an erroneous principle of treaty interpretation that overrides the express wording of the treaty itself.\n\n32.\n\nThe Applicants conclude by submitting that to properly exercise jurisdiction, a tribunal must first address its mind to each of the questions that it is called upon to answer. To not answer each question with a clear indication of its deliberation is to fail to exercise its jurisdiction and thereby to manifestly exceed its powers. A tribunal cannot avoid exercising jurisdiction. It must apply its powers properly. To not do so is to abuse its discretion and to manifestly exceed its powers. The Applicants state that they are arguing about an error of jurisdiction so fundamental that it undermines the entire analysis of the case which is a type of error that falls within Article 52(1)(b). They allege that the test for the Tribunal to be deemed to have manifestly exceeded its powers is that the error must be textually obvious and substantively serious, as is apparent on the face of Article VI(1)(a) and Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT. It does not matter whether the mistake is readily noticeable or obvious at first sight, so long as it is obvious from the text.\n\n33.\n\nIn reply, the Republic of Ecuador indicates that in deciding that the BIT does not extend to disputes arising before it entered into force, the Tribunal has not manifestly exceeded its powers. The basic premise is that BITs must be interpreted in a manner consistent with the general principles and rules of international law. The general rule of interpretation of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention leads to the conclusion of the Tribunal that the BIT does not cover disputes which arose prior to the date of entry into force. In particular, Article XII of the BIT says absolutely nothing about retroactive application. For all events, the interpretation of the temporal scope is the direct application of the principle of non-retroactivity which is, according to the Respondent, *\"a primary source of international law\"* that does not require the support of any other source or authority. The Tribunal decided that there was no jurisdiction over this dispute because the test of application of Article 28 of the Vienna Convention and Article XII of the BIT is not whether a dispute arose before the BIT entered into force or continued thereafter but whether the facts or acts which gave rise to the dispute were committed and completed before the treaty entered into force or thereafter. Ecuador further points out that the whole of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT was clearly intended to govern the future. Abundant case-law, *Tecmed v. Mexico,42 Pey Casado v.* *Chile,43 Salini v. Jordan44* and *Tradex v. Albania,45* also demonstrates that even when treaties are silent regarding the temporal scope of an ICSID tribunal's jurisdiction, the language used in the BIT has constituted a strong indication that the parties agree that the treaty is directed at the future. Some tribunals *(Mondev v. United States,46 Pey Casado v. Chile,47 Impregiio v. Pakistan,48 Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine49* and *S.G. v. Dominican Republic50)* have applied the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties to disputes arising prior to the entry into force of a BIT with the same meaning as the Tribunal in this case which clearly demonstrates that its interpretation is not absurd or so irrational that no sensible person could accept it. The Republic of Ecuador considers that the Applicants' reliance on the judgment of the PCIJ in *Mavrommatis* is misplaced and they invoke the judgment of the International Court of Justice in *Ambatielos51* rejecting retroactive application of a treaty to earlier events. The Republic of Ecuador argues that it is not necessary to know whether the Tribunal should have accepted certain contractual claims or not; it is sufficient to establish that this is a reasonable position that has been adopted by other tribunals or by part of the legal doctrine.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v.

Pakistan.52* Contractual claims that are brought before a treaty-based tribunal must also amount to a violation of the treaty standards as emphasized in *Lesi-Dipenta v. Algeria53* and, therefore, in the absence of a specific provision, an arbitration clause, albeit broadly worded, cannot provide a basis for the jurisdiction of such tribunal over purely contractual claims. Ecuador also asserts that contractual jurisdiction under a BIT may only be in respect of an investment contract with the State itself and not with a separate entity such as INECEL and that an investor invoking contractual jurisdiction pursuant to an offer made by the State must itself comply with the contractual arrangements for dispute settlements with that State.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v.

Algeria).*\n\n35.\n\nThe Republic of Ecuador further submits that the temporal limitations of the BIT are applicable to both classes of disputes and adds that the decisions in *Lucchetti v. Peru,54 Jan de Nul v. Egypt55* and *Pey Casado v. Chile56* indicate that if there was a dispute between M.C.I, and New Turbine, on the one side, and Ecuador, on the other, prior to the entry into force of the BIT, it would be necessary to consider the origin of the BIT claim and to establish whether the claim arose on or after the date of entry into force of the BIT. If the new claim and the old claim have the same origin or subject-matter, *i.e.,* an act that took place before the entry into force of the BIT, a decision by the Tribunal not to exercise jurisdiction *ratione temporis* is well supported. Whether the case has been about a single dispute or whether it is related to two different disputes, the Tribunal's decision encompasses both situations because they both fall into the category of disputes that the Tribunal excluded from its jurisdiction, those arising prior to the entry into force of the Treaty. The claims related to a contract that had been terminated before the BIT entered into force and were therefore outside the jurisdictional scope of the Tribunal. Article VI is a merely introductory clause which is normally found in BITs and cannot be taken as a substantive clause that contains a broad consent to arbitration, whether on a treaty or contract basis. It would be curious if what had been intended was to provide an umbrella clause subject to Article 28, while at the same time considering Article VI(1)(a) as a jurisdictional provision that would not be subject to Article 28.\n\n*Lucchetti* v. *Peru, supra* note 15.\n\n*Jan deNul v. Egypt, supra* note 35, para. 116.\n\n*Pey Casado v. Chile, supra note* 12.\n\n36.\n\nThe Republic of Ecuador finally declares that, even assuming that the Tribunal had erroneously applied the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties and therefore had incorrectly interpreted the BIT, such an error of interpretation would not constitute an excess of power because this would otherwise amount to admitting an appeal of the arbitral award. The Republic of Ecuador declares that the non-application of the proper law is a question of interpretation which cannot constitute a ground for annulment. As the history of the Washington Convention reveals, an incorrect application of the law is not a basis for annulment. Moreover, the Republic of Ecuador argues that the excess of power must be manifest, obvious at first sight, and that, if an elaborate interpretation is necessary, the excess of powers is not evident. In this case, there was no error so outrageous that no reasonable person could admit it.\n\n**B) ANALYSIS OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nFailure to apply the proper law is not an independent ground for annulment under Article 52 of the Washington Convention. *Ad hoc* committee decisions however recognize that a tribunal's failure to apply the applicable law may constitute a manifest excess of powers pursuant to Article 52(1)(b).57 In *Klockner (I),* the *ad hoc* Committee thus ruled that *\"[e]xcess of powers may consist of the non-application by the arbitrator of the rules contained in the arbitration agreement.\"58* While Article 42(1) of the Washington Convention is concerned with the law applicable to the merits of the dispute,59 issues of jurisdiction are addressed in Article 25 of the Washington Convention which provides: *\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State), and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"* In the present case, Article VI(3)(a)(i) of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT identifies ICSID as a possible forum to be selected by the investor. According to this provision, the investor *\"may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration: (i) to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\u2018Centre) established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\u2018ICSID Convention\u2019), provided that the Party is a party to such Convention* [...],\" as is the case for both Ecuador and the United States. When a unilateral offer of ICSID arbitration is given in a BIT to qualified investors by the Contracting States, such as in Article VI(4) of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT,60 the Tribunal which is established bases its competence on both Article 25 of the Washington Convention and the BIT for the conditions of consent.61\n\nSee *e.g,* Decisions of the Annulment Committees in *Klockner (I), supra* note 14, para. 59; *Amco I, supra* note 15, paras. 23 and 95; *MINE, supra* note 15, para. 6.40; *CMS v. Argentina, supra* note 15, para. 49; *Soufraki v. UAE, supra* note 15, paras. 37 and 85.\n\n*Klockner (I), supra* note 14, para. 59.\n\nIn its Award, para. 217, the Tribunal held that there was no evidence of any agreement in the BIT on the law applicable to the dispute. Article 42(1) of the Washington Convention invites the Tribunal to *\"decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties.\"* The second sentence of Article 42(1) of the Washington Convention reads: *\"In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable. \"* Regarding the law applicable to the merits, the Award states: *\"[...] the Tribunal considers that it must respect the* *provisions of the second part of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention,* i.e., *in the absence of an agreement, the Tribunal shall apply Ecuadorian Law, including its rules of private international law and such rules of international law as may be applicable. With respect to the latter rules, the Tribunal finds that the rules contained in the BIT, as well as the other pertinent rules of general international law, are applicable in the present case. The Tribunal's Competence over the Merits of the disputes submitted is limited, in this respect, to considering the contentions of the Claimants relating to violation of the BIT after it came into force.\"*\n\nArticle VI(4) of the BIT provides that: *\"[e]ach Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3.\"*\n\n*CMS v. Argentina, supra* note 15, para. 68 *\"the applicable jurisdictional provisions are only those of the Convention and of the BIT, not those which might arise from national legislation.\" Salini v. Jordan, supra* note 39, para. 62, 63. Award, paras. 157-160.\n\n38.\n\nThe main jurisdictional issue raised by Ecuador before the Tribunal was that of the temporal scope of its offer of arbitration. The crucial question concerned the effect of the BIT on events alleged to be prior and subsequent to its entry into force. The U.S.-Ecuador BIT which came into force on May 11, 1997 does not contain any provision on retroactivity apart from Article XII(1) which provides that the Treaty *\"shall apply to investments existing at the time of entry into force as well as to investments made or acquired thereafter.\"* The Tribunal noted in para. 57 of its Award M.C.I.\u2019s and New Turbine\u2019s argument that the application of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT is not limited to disputes arising subsequent to its entry into force. Relying on Article 28 in the Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Tribunal concluded as follows: *\"The nonretroactivity of the BIT excludes its application to disputes arising prior to its entry into force. Any dispute arising prior to that date will not be capable of being submitted to the dispute resolution system established by the BIT. The silence of the text of the BIT with respect to its scope in relation to disputes prior to its entry into force does not alter the effects of the principle of the non-retroactivity of treaties.\"62*\n\nAward., para. 61.\n\n39.\n\nRelying on previous jurisprudence, the Tribunal further distinguished *\"acts and omissions prior to the entry into force of the BIT from acts and omissions subsequent to that date as violations of the BIT\"* and held that *\"a dispute that arises that is subject* *to its Competence is necessarily related to the violation of a norm of the BIT by act or omission subsequent to its entry into force.\"63* The Tribunal also distinguished *\"disputes arising prior to the entry into force of the BIT from disputes arising after that date that have the same cause or background with those prior disputes\"64* and observed: *\"[...] a prior dispute may evolve into a new dispute, but the fact that this new dispute has arisen does not change the effects of the non-retroactivity of the BIT with respect to the dispute prior to its entry into force. Prior disputes that continue after the entry into force of the BIT are not covered by the BIT.\"65*\n\n*Id.,* para. 62.\n\n*Id,* para. 65.\n\n*Id,* para. 66.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal finally held *\"that it has Competence over events subsequent to the entry into force of the BIT when those acts are alleged to be violations of the BIT\"* and that *\"[p]rior events may only be considered by the Tribunal for purposes of understanding the background, the causes, or scope of violations of the BIT that occurred after its entry into force.\"66* Furthermore, the Tribunal accepted that Article XII of the BIT applies to investments existing at the time of its entry into force when it turned to Ecuador's subsidiary objection regarding the existence of an investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the Washington Convention67 but decided that the suits submitted by Seacoast to the Ecuadorian courts on allegations of contractual breaches related to disputes which arose prior to the entry into force of the BIT and therefore remained outside its temporal competence.68 In their oral arguments before the Committee, the Applicants clarified that their criticism of the Tribunal's failure to apply the proper law of the dispute to jurisdiction concerns the failure to apply Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT.69 In this respect, the Committee notes that the law applicable to the merits of the dispute is without effect on the issue of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction which is to be determined exclusively on the basis of Article 25 of the Washington Convention, the relevant jurisdictional clauses of the BIT and any applicable principles of international law.\n\n*Id,* para. 93.\n\n*Id,* para. 162.\n\n*Id.,* para. 189.\n\nTr. pp. 177-178, 200-202.\n\n41.\n\nIn examining the implications of the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties for the temporal and jurisdictional provisions of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, the Tribunal can be considered to have complied with its earlier declaration: *\"The Tribunal will decide on the objections to Jurisdiction raised by the Respondent and rejected by the Claimants in accordance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention, the BIT, and the applicable norms of general international law, including the customary rules recognized in the Final Draft of the International Law Commission of the UN [...] Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts with commentaries. [...] For purposes of interpreting the treaties applicable to the objections submitted, the Tribunal will be guided by the rules contained in the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties [....] that reflect customary law on the subject. [...] The Tribunal will refer to precedents that state the legal implications of* *binding norms of conventional and customary international law that are applicable only to the extent that and insofar as they specially relate to the present case.\"70* It is another matter - over which the *ad hoc* Committee has only a very limited competence - whether the Tribunal\u2019s application of the law was well-founded and legally tenable.\n\nAward, paras. 42-44.\n\n42.\n\nThe non-application of the proper law which may be sanctioned by Article 52(1)(b) should indeed not be confused with the erroneous or incorrect application of the proper law which is not a ground for annulment as consistently underlined in numerous decisions of *ad hoc* committees.71 The *Amco I* Committee, for example, held: *\"The law applied by the Tribunal will be examined by the* ad hoc *Committee, not for the purpose of scrutinizing whether the Tribunal committed errors in the interpretation of the requirements of applicable law or in the ascertainment or evaluation of the relevant facts to which such law has been applied. Such scrutiny is properly the task of a court of appeals, which the* ad hoc *Committee is not. The* ad hoc *Committee will limit itself to determining whether the Tribunal did in fact apply the law it was bound to apply to the dispute. Failure to apply such law, as distinguished from mere misconstruction of that law, would constitute a manifest excess of powers on the part of the Tribunal and a ground for nullity under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention\"72* A distinction should therefore be drawn between, on the one hand, what was decided by the tribunal, which concerns a manifest excess of powers, and, on the other hand, how it was decided by the tribunal, which in principle escapes the scrutiny of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) as concerning the reasoning of the tribunal.\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE, supra* note 15, para. 85; *Klockner (I), supra* note 14, para. 60; *Amco I, supra* note 15, para. 23; *MTD v. Chile, supra* note 10, para. 47; *CMS v. Argentina, supra note* 15, paras. 49-52. *InMINE, supra note* 15, paras. 5.03-5.04, the *adhoc* Committee expressed the view that: *\"[a] tribunal's disregard of the agreed rules of law would constitute a derogation from the terms of reference within which the tribunal has been authorized to function. Examples of such a derogation include the application of rules of law other than the ones agreed by the parties, or a decision not based on any law unless the parties had agreed on a decision* ex aequo et bono. *If the derogation is manifest, it entails a manifest excess of power.\"*\n\n*Amco I, supra* note 15, para. 23.\n\n43.\n\nHowever, the freedom which the tribunal enjoys in the application of the law is not unlimited, since the arbitrators are required to remain within their terms of reference as remarked upon in the *MINE* annulment decision73 and not to exceed their powers. The *Soufraki v. UAE ad hoc* Committee recognized that *\"[m]isinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law may, in particular cases, be so gross or egregious as substantially to amount to failure to apply the proper law.\"74* The Applicants agree that ignoring the law and interpreting the law incorrectly must be distinguished, but they argue that the Tribunal's interpretation of the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties was egregiously wrong and so grave as to be tantamount to an abrogation of the BIT.\n\n*MINE, supra note* 15, paras.5.03-5.04.\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE, supra note* 15, para. 86.\n\n44.\n\nIn the Applicants\u2019 view, the relevant *\"omission\"* is Ecuador's failure to fulfill its obligation to pay US$ 24.2 million in respect of the \"accounts receivable.\" The alleged payment obligation is essentially based on the Seacoast Contract. The alleged payment obligation started before the BIT had entered into force on May 11, 1997 but continued beyond that date. In the absence of special rules in the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, the only relevant temporal restriction is the limitation applicable to treaties in general, as reflected in Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which excludes the retroactive application of a treaty to *\"any act or fact which took place or any situation which ceased to exist before the entry into force of the treaty.\"* Ecuador relied upon Article 28 in support of its main objection to the competence of the Tribunal because of the non-retroactivity of the BIT,75 while M.C.I, and New Turbine pleaded that Article 28 only bars a tribunal's ability to examine conduct occurring before a treaty came into force to the extent that that conduct ceased to exist before the date on which the treaty came into force.76\n\nAward, para. 47.\n\n*Id.,* para. 58.\n\n45.\n\nAlthough Article 28 refers to an **\"act\"**, it must be assumed that an *\"omission\"* which is claimed to be a breach of treaty obligations is to be assimilated to an **\"act\"**. Several paragraphs of the Award in which the Tribunal refers to *\"acts or omissions\"* show that the Tribunal also assimilated *\"omissions\"* to *\"acts\"* (see for instance para. 97 of the Award). It is important to note that the relevant point in time in Article 28 is not when a dispute arose but the time when an act or fact took place or a situation ceased to exist. This is a distinction of considerable importance in the present case as the Republic of Ecuador acknowledged in the course of the oral hearing.77 In its Award, the Tribunal nevertheless attached special weight to the fact that the dispute about the \"accounts receivable\" arose before the BIT entered into force. The Tribunal stated, *inter alia,* as follows: *\"The non-retroactivity of the BIT excludes its application to disputes arising prior to its entry into force.78 [...] Prior disputes that continue after the entry into force of the BIT are not covered by the BIT.\"79*\n\nTr. p. 215.\n\nAward, para. 61.\n\n*Id,* para. 66.\n\n46.\n\nIf it is accepted that the \"accounts receivable\" are protected as an \"investment\" under the BIT,80 the Applicants contend that it would be logical to consider their alleged right to receive payment to be protected under the BIT as from the date of its entry into force. As stated above, the BIT was made applicable to investments already existing at the time of its entry into force.81 Moreover, according to Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT, a dispute arising out of an investment agreement was to be regarded as an investment dispute. In response to a question from the Committee, the Applicants declared that *\"Article VI(1)(a) is a prime rule\"* which expresses *\"a different intention [...] under Article 28\"* of the Vienna Convention.82 It would follow that, while the dispute arose before the BIT entered into force, Ecuador's failure to pay its alleged debt, which the Applicants consider to be a breach of both the Seacoast Contract and the BIT, continued after the entry into force of the BIT. In other words, the \"claim to money\", which before May 11, 1997 was exclusively a contractual claim, became an existing \"investment\" protected under the BIT after its entry into force. Having regard to the language of Article 28 of the Vienna Convention, the situation regarding the \"accounts receivable\" could be considered not to have ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the BIT.\n\n*Id,* para. 164.\n\n*Id,* para. 162.\n\nTr. pp. 194-195.\n\n47.\n\nThe said reasoning presupposes that Ecuador\u2019s failure to pay its alleged debt is not considered an instantaneous omission but is accepted as a continuous omission or as a durable situation. However, this is not the way the facts are interpreted by the Tribunal. On the contrary, after referring to Ecuador\u2019s conclusion that the alleged offence was consummated prior to the entry into force of the BIT in a completed act of refusal to recognize the rights claimed by Seacoast,83 and after commenting on previous case-law84 and the ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,85 the Tribunal concluded that the acts and omissions alleged by the Claimants as having occurred prior to the entry into force of the BIT did not constitute continuing and composite acts under the BIT.86\n\nAward, para. 81.\n\n*Id.,* para. 84.\n\n*Id,* paras. 85-92.\n\n*Id,* para. 97.\n\n48.\n\nIt thus appears that the Tribunal did regard Ecuador\u2019s refusal to pay the alleged accounts receivable as an instantaneous act occurring before the date of the entry into force of the BIT rather than as a continuing omission extending beyond that date. This may explain the Tribunal\u2019s further conclusion that the present dispute falls outside the temporal limitations of the BIT, although the relevant element under Article 28 of the Vienna Convention would be the date when the act occurred or the situation ceased to exist rather than the date when the dispute arose.\n\n49.\n\nIn any case, what is required for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the Washington Convention is a *\"manifest excess of powers\"* which should be understood as tantamount to a safety valve allowing for the rejection of arbitrary or unreasonable decisions. In *MINE,* the ***ad hoc*** Committee ruled that *\"Article 52(1)(h) does not provide a sanction for every excess of its powers by a tribunal but requires that the excess be manifest which necessarily limits an* ad hoc *Committee's freedom of appreciation as to whether the tribunal has exceeded its powers.\"87* In *Wena v. Egypt,* the ***ad hoc*** Committee specified that *\"[t]he excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other\"* and that, when such interpretations are needed, *\"the excess of power is no longer manifest.\"88* In *CDC v. Seychelles,* the Committee also pointed out that *\"the term \u2018manifest\u2019 means clear or \u2018self evident\u2019\"* and added: *\"Thus, even if a Tribunal exceeds its powers, the excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal's conduct, if susceptible of argument \u2018one way or the other \u2019 is not manifest.\"89* The decision of the ***ad hoc*** Committee in *Patrick Mitchell v Congo* also lends credence to such view: *\"If an excess of powers is to be the cause of an annulment, the* ad hoc *Committee must find with certainty and immediacy, without it being necessary to engage in elaborate analyses of the award.\"90* In sum, the manifest excess requirement in Article 52(1)(b) suggests a somewhat higher degree of proof than a searching analysis of the findings of the Tribunal.\n\n*MINE, supra* note 15, para. 4.06. *See* also *CDC Group pic v. Republic of Seychelles* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14), Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005, para. 39 (hereinafter referred to as *CDC v. Seychelles).*\n\n*Wena v. Egypt, supra* note 15, para. 25.\n\n*CDC v. Seychelles, supra* note 87, para. 41.\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v. Congo, supra note* 15, para. 20.\n\n50.\n\nThe parties in the present case accept the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties as set out in Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. The Tribunal noted in its Award that the Claimants did not *\"deny the non-retroactive nature of the BIT.\"91* The Tribunal also noted, however, the Claimants\u2019 argument that the Tribunal must consider events occurring before the BIT entered into force because Ecuador's actions, although starting before the BIT's entry into force, were of a continuing or composite nature, and thus were taking place also after the BIT had entered into force. The Claimants further submitted that events occurring prior to the entry into force of the BIT were important for determining the damages caused by Ecuador's actions after that date.92 The Tribunal concluded that \"[...] *the intention of the contracting Parties* [of the BIT] *with respect to its retrospective application is not evident from its clauses or in any other manner. In accordance with the norms of general international law codified in the Vienna Convention, and particularly in Article 28, the Tribunal notes that because of the fact that the BIT applies to investments existing at the time of its entry into force, the temporal effects of its clauses are not modified.\"93* It is common ground that Article 28 is a dispositive rule and that the Contracting States may wish to derogate from it by conferring retroactive applicability to their BIT. The Applicants have for example expressly admitted during the hearing that it is not an intangible principle.94\n\nAward, para. 55.\n\n*Id.,* para. 56.\n\n*Id,* para. 59.\n\nTr. pp. 194-196.\n\n51.\n\nThe present case is not a case where the Tribunal admitted a legal principle and then willfully decided to disregard it. In *MTD v. Chile,* the *ad hoc* Committee emphasized that *\"[t]he error must be \u2018manifest\u2019, not arguable, and a misapprehension (still less mere disagreement) as to the content of a particular rule is not enough.\"95* As the *ad hoc* Committee in *Soufraki v. UAE* declared, *\"[s]uch gross and consequential misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law which no reasonable person* (\u2018bon p\u00e8re de famille\u2019) *could accept needs to be distinguished from simple error -even a serious error - in the interpretation of the law which in many national jurisdictions may be the subject of ordinary appeal as distinguished from, e.g., an extraordinary writ of* certiorari.\"96 An egregious violation of the law would assume that there is a departure from a legal principle or legal norm which is clear and cannot give rise to divergent interpretations. Any other type of violation would not amount to a manifest excess of powers. Should more than one interpretation of a legal norm or rule be possible, no serious violation can ensue where one of these interpretations has been chosen. As the *Lucchetti v. Peru* Committee remarked, *\"[t]reaty interpretation is not an exact science, and it is frequently the case that there is more than one possible interpretation of a disputed provision, sometimes several.\"97*\n\n*MTD* v. *Chile, supra* note 10, para. 47.\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE, supra note* 15, para. 86.\n\n*Lucchetti v. Peru, supra* note 15, para. 112.\n\n52.\n\nConstruction of the BIT has been approached by the Tribunal in terms of treaty interpretation. Both parties, which had already staked out irreconcilable positions before the Tribunal, have in these annulment proceedings exchanged contradictory pleadings on the retroactive application of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT and invoked, *inter alia,* the authority of ICSID awards and those of other investment tribunals as well as the judgment of the PCIJ in *Mavrommatis* in support of their respective interpretations of the BIT. The Applicants have relied on *Mondev v. United States, UPS v. Canada* and *SGS v. Philippines* to show that tribunals have accepted jurisdiction over a dispute that arose before its governing treaty came into force. The Republic of Ecuador has invoked the awards in *Lucchetti v. Peru, Jan de Nul v. Egypt, Pey Casado v. Chile, Mondev v. United States, Impregiio v. Pakistan* and *Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine* as well as the judgment of the ICJ in *Ambatielos,* to demonstrate that the Tribunal was right in declining jurisdiction over a dispute arising before the BIT came into force. The parties have argued over the significance of these awards and judgments and their relevance to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over the accounts receivable dispute under the U.S.-Ecuador BIT and have also invoked legal doctrine. The Applicants further rely on the decision of the *Soufraki v. UAE* Committee which stated: *\"Indeed, the Tribunal cited no authority whatsoever for its conclusion. But if the principle on which the Award is based does exist, there is in reality no ground for annulment [,..].\"98* The Applicants interpret such statement as meaning that, in the reverse, if the principle for which the Tribunal failed to provide authority was not in fact justifiable, the Tribunal's reliance on that principle would have involved a manifest excess of powers. The Applicants do not indicate why and how an opinion possibly different from those they rely upon is untenable and could not be supported by reasonable arguments. The parties' competing contentions and the investment cases referred to in one way or another in support of their positions provide sufficient evidence that temporal applicability of consent to disputes that arose before the coming into force may be subject to debate. Moreover, the Applicants' interpretation of Article VI of the BIT is not the only reasonable interpretation of the Treaty. Other views are also possible and could not necessarily be discarded as being fundamentally wrong. The refusal of the Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over the accounts receivable appears to the *ad hoc* Committee to be a debatable solution, and notwithstanding that another solution would have been possible, the Committee cannot find in this respect any egregious violation of the law on the part of the Tribunal.\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE, supra* note 15, para. 63\n\n53.\n\nThe Applicants suggest another interpretation of the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties which would be consonant with their own understanding that, absent an express non-retroactivity clause in the BIT, the Treaty governs disputes that arose before it came into force, provided that such disputes continued to exist at the time of its entry into force. The Applicants point out that the U.S.-Ecuador BIT differs from many BITs which provide that disputes arising before the entry into force of the BIT are excluded from the application of the BIT. In support of their interpretation, they make a comparison with the language of these other investment treaties, in particular with those signed by Ecuador or the United States. However, whilst it is not the task of the Committee to make its own choice between different interpretations of the applicable BIT, special weight must be given to the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation which the Committee can only set aside in the narrow circumstances provided by Article 52 of the Washington Convention. The plain reading of Article VI(1)(a) and Article VI(1)(c) suggested by the Applicants is in fact an invitation to the Committee to revise the Tribunal's conclusions on the interpretation of the temporal application of the BIT; the Committee is, however, not free to do so on the basis of Article 52(1)(b).\n\n54.\n\nMore generally, the Committee would be treating the request as an appeal and not as a request for annulment if it accepted the Applicants' invitation to review the Tribunal's findings in light of the rules of interpretation set out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties or to discuss the Applicants' interpretation of Article VI(1)(a) whose language,99 they also assert, extends to contractual disputes without any temporal limitation as opposed to Article VI(1)(c) which concerns violations of the BIT. The **ad hoc** Committee in *CMS v. Argentina* held that it had *\"no jurisdiction to control the interpretation [...] given by the Tribunal to* [an applicable provision].\"100 The Committee has also in mind that the *Klockner (I)* annulment decision cautioned about *\"the fine distinction between \u2018non-application\u2019 of the applicable law and mistaken application of such* law\"101 and that in *Wena v. Egypt,* the **ad hoc** Committee subsequently declared that it was mindful of *\"the distinction between failure to apply the proper law and the error* in judicando *drawn in Klockner (I), and the consequential need to avoid the reopening of the merits in proceedings that would turn annulment into appeal.\"102* In combating the Tribunal's failure to \"properly\" apply the terms of the BIT which, in their opinion, place no temporal limitation on jurisdiction with respect to disputes arising out of or in relation to the Seacoast Contract, the Applicants are seeking a remedy which cannot be provided by the Committee acting under Article 52. The Committee would otherwise be superimposing its own views about the correct solution. As stated by the *ad hoc* Committee in *CMS v. Argentina, \"the Committee cannot simply substitute its own view of the law and its own appreciation of the facts for those of the Tribunal.\"103'*\n\nArticle VI(1)(a) of the BIT, *supra* note 41.\n\n*CMS v. Argentina, supra note* 15, para. 85.\n\n*Klockner (I), supra note* 14, para. 60.\n\n*Wena v. Egypt,* supra note 15, para. 22.\n\n*CMS v. Argentina, supra note* 15, para. 136.\n\n55.\n\nIt makes no difference that the issue in this case is about the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, since jurisdiction does not give the ***ad hoc*** Committee a wider competence to assess the validity of the award under Article 52 but must be dealt with as any other issue. The standards for reviewing the Tribunal's decision about competence are therefore the same as those which ***ad hoc*** committees should apply when they review any other matters. In *Soufraki v. UAE,* the ***ad hoc*** Committee stated that it saw *\"no reason why the rule that an excess of power must be manifest in order to be annullable should be* *disregarded when the question under discussion is a jurisdictional issue.\"* The Committee added: *\"Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention does not distinguish between findings on jurisdiction and findings on the merits [...]. It follows that the requirement that an excess of power must be \u2018manifest \u2019 applies equally if the question is one of jurisdiction. A jurisdictional error is not a separate category of excess ofpower.\"104* In the already mentioned decision of the *ad hoc* Committee in *Lucchetti v. Peru,* a number of pertinent observations were made concerning the standard of \"manifest excess of powers\" in relation to the competence of the Tribunal to which this Committee adheres: *\"[...] the requirements in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention is not only that the Tribunal has exceeded its powers but that it has done so \u2018manifestly\u2019. From the writings of legal scholars it appears that there are divergent views on the impact of this additional requirement of \u2018manifestness\u2019. On the one hand, the view has been expressed that where an* ad hoc *Committee finds that a tribunal has wrongly either exercised or failed to exercise jurisdiction, the award should be annulled, wholly or partly, without any further examination of whether the excess was manifest. On the other hand, it has been held by others that there should be no annulment when the tribunal has wrongly assumed, or failed to assume, jurisdiction, but its decision on this point was tenable, since in such a case the tribunal would not have manifestly acted contrary to the BIT. [...] The* ad hoc *Committee, for its part, attaches weight to the fact that the wording of Article 52(1)(b) is general and makes no exception for issues of jurisdiction. Moreover, a request for annulment is not an appeal, which means that there should not be a full review of the tribunal's award. One general purpose of Article 52, including its sub-paragraph (1)(b), must be that annulment should not occur easily. From this perspective, the Committee considers that the word \u2018manifest\u2019 should be given considerable weight also when matters of jurisdiction are concerned.\"105*\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE, supra note* 15, paras 118-119.\n\n*Lucchetti v. Peru, supra note* 15, paras. 100-101.\n\n56.\n\nA decision that there is no jurisdiction may result in a manifest excess of powers when the Tribunal has acted outside the proper bounds of its competence. The *Lucchetti v. Peru* Committee declared: *\"Where a tribunal assumes jurisdiction in a matter for which it lacks competence under the relevant BIT, it exceeds its powers. The same is true in the inverse case where a tribunal refuses or fails to exercise jurisdiction in a matter for which it is competent under the BIT. The* Ad hoc *Committee considers that these situations are analogous and should be assessed according to the same legal standards.\"106*\n\n*Id.,* para. 99.\n\n57.\n\nIn view of the above, the *ad hoc* Committee concludes that the Applicants have not shown that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to exercise jurisdiction over the accounts receivable. Consequently, the Tribunal\u2019s Award cannot be annulled on the basis of Article 52(1)(b) of the Washington Convention.\n\n**V. ARTICLE 52(1)(e): FAILURE TO STATE REASONS**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**A) PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS:**\n----------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Applicants first contend that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for the Award by forgetting to address the question whether Ecuador breached the BIT by continuously refusing to pay the US$ 24.2 million outstanding accounts receivable owed to them whether on a continuous basis or only after the entry into force of the Treaty, which is, according to the Applicants, a failure to address an issue of sufficient importance affecting the outcome of the Award. The Applicants submit that, because the Tribunal found that the accounts receivable were a protected investment at the time the BIT came into force, the Tribunal was obliged to apply the procedural and substantive protection of the BIT to that investment. The Tribunal however did not deal with this matter on the merits and offered no reasons whatsoever for this deliberate omission. The Applicants contend that had the Tribunal turned its mind to the fact of Ecuador's refusal to honor the debt it owed to them for their accounts receivable, it may well have concluded that Ecuador violated the obligations observance clause under the BIT. This error was in the Applicants' view, of the utmost significance for the legal rights of the parties, and as a result they were denied a chance of redress and reparation.\n\n59.\n\nThe Applicants submit that their arguments on the continuous failure to pay the accounts receivable would have required the Tribunal to make a determination of when the refusal began, and more importantly, when it was consummated. They complain that the Tribunal, nonetheless, neglected to turn its mind to this important factual issue and, instead of looking at the concrete elements of this case, developed an analysis restricted to an esoteric discussion on the law of continuing and composite acts. The Applicants allege that the Tribunal, without engaging in any type of application of the legal rules concerning continuous breach to the facts of the case, dismissed their arguments in a perfunctory manner in ruling that the *\"acts and omissions alleged by the Claimants as being prior to the entry into force of the BIT do not constitute continuing and composite wrongful acts under the BIT.\"107*\n\nAward, para. 97.\n\n60.\n\nThe Applicants next assert that, if the Tribunal is deemed to have implicitly addressed the question of its jurisdiction over the accounts receivable claim, yet to have rejected it because the dispute arose before the U.S.-Ecuador BIT came into force, the reasoning is incoherent, frivolous and therefore amounts to a failure to state reasons. The Applicants argue in this regard that there is no connection between the Tribunal's decision and its unsubstantiated reliance on Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, where nothing suggests that tribunals do not have jurisdiction over disputes arising before the treaty came into force.\n\n61.\n\nThe Applicants finally contend that, to the extent that the Tribunal failed to assume jurisdiction over the contractual side of the dispute, the Tribunal also failed to state reasons on which the award is based. Instead, the Tribunal simply treated the channels for resolving the contractual and BIT disputes as one-and-the-same, and held that the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties precluded it from taking jurisdiction over the dispute. The Tribunal concluded that it need not determine whether Ecuador breached the *Seacoast Contract* because the U.S.-Ecuador BIT was not in force at the time when the alleged breaches took place. According to the Applicants, it gave no indication as to how it reached that conclusion and simply parroted its earlier finding that *\"in accordance with the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties, [contractual] disputes remain outside the temporal Competence of this Tribunal.\"108* The Applicants point out that such conclusion is inadequate, incoherent and patently wrong in law according to the plain language of Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT.\n\n*Id.,* para. 189.\n\n62.\n\nThe Republic of Ecuador affirms that the Tribunal ruled clearly and explicitly on the issue of the accounts receivable. At the hearing before the *ad hoc* Committee, the Republic of Ecuador alleged that the Applicants made a contract claim and invoked Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT for the first time in the annulment proceedings and that furthermore the request for arbitration did not include such claim. The Republic of Ecuador nonetheless held that the Tribunal decided the claim under the Contract, even though it could have been excused for not deciding a question that was not presented to it by M.C.I, and New Turbine.\n\n63.\n\nThe Republic of Ecuador states that, with respect to everything that happened prior to the BIT's entry into force, including the accounts receivable, the Tribunal decided that it lacked jurisdiction because these were allegations that, if they came to be proven, would constitute *\"intangible assets\"* considered *prima facie* as an investment but which could not give rise to violations of the BIT because the BIT was not in force at the time the alleged contractual breaches took place. Their resolution does not fall within the scope of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. The Republic of Ecuador observes that the Tribunal found that the accounts receivable were one of the points in a dispute that arose and ended prior to the entry into force of the BIT and that, in accordance with the principle of the non-retroactivity of treaties, disputes that arose before the BIT came into force are outside its jurisdiction. The Republic of Ecuador affirms that the Tribunal dealt with the issue of the dismissal of the accounts receivable claim when asserting that, in accordance with customary international law, the relevant element to determine the very existence of an internationally wrongful act is the violation of a norm of international law existing at the time when the act begins. The BIT does not apply to acts or facts which are completed or to situations which have ceased to exist before the Treaty came into force.\n\n64.\n\nThe Republic of Ecuador maintains that the Tribunal considered the arguments of M.C.I, and New Turbine and expressly determined that the refusal to pay was not a continuous act, and that, therefore, there could be no beginning or consummation. Such a distinction is impossible when the act, such as Ecuador's refusal to recognize M.C.I.'s alleged right, is instantaneous. As case-law in *Mondev v. United States109* and *Impregiio v. Pakistan110* demonstrates, a conduct which gives rise to a dispute must be distinguished from its final effects. Ecuador's refusal to acknowledge Seacoast's rights constitutes only the final effects of a conduct which arose before the entry into force of the BIT. The fact that Seacoast insisted on its claim several times over the years and that Ecuador repeatedly responded each time that the claims were unfounded does not mean that the refusal was a continuing act. The Republic of Ecuador considers that the Applicants, by insisting on the same argument, only try to have the Committee review and reconstruct facts. However, the Tribunal\u2019s findings of fact are not the subject of annulment proceedings. The contractual claim is based on the same dispute, involving the same underlying facts which the Tribunal found to have occurred prior to the entry into force of the BIT and therefore fails for the same reasons as the treaty-based claim.\n\n*Mondev v. UnitedStates, supra* note31, para. 58.\n\n*Impregilo v. Pakistan, supra note* 38, para. 313.\n\n65.\n\nThe Republic of Ecuador finally considers that the reasons provided by the Tribunal are sufficient, that the reasoning is clear and coherent and devoid of contradiction, and that this characteristic does not disappear even if it were to be admitted hypothetically that the Tribunal's point of departure that an express rule is required to make Article VI(4) of the BIT retroactive was mistaken, because it is not in the nature of the annulment proceedings to correct the supposed error111. The Republic of Ecuador asserts that the Applicants confuse absence of reasons with a discrepancy over the correctness of the reasons invoked, but the Tribunal has expressed its reasons which unquestionably make it possible to understand the grounds for its decision, and the fact that the Applicants do not agree with them does not constitute grounds for annulment.\n\nAward, paras. 59- 97.\n\n**B) ANALYSIS OF THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE:**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nFailure to state reasons is a ground for annulment frequently invoked in applications for annulment. Although failure to deal with questions submitted to the Tribunal is not a separate ground for annulment under Article 52 of the Washington Convention, there is a pattern of past decisions of ***ad hoc*** committees that have considered that such failure amounts to a failure to state reasons. For example, the ***ad hoc*** Committee in *MINE* annulled the award for failure to deal with questions presented by the parties.112 The Applicants concede that, \"for the purposes of annulment, just as a tribunal's excess of power must be substantially serious, so too must a tribunal's failure to address a question at issue be more than a trivial or otherwise inconsequential oversight.\"113 Their statement accords with the ***ad hoc*** Committee decision in *Wena v. Egypt* which specified that *\"[t]he ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) includes therefore the case where the Tribunal omitted to decide upon a question submitted to it to the extent such supplemental decision may affect the reasoning supporting the Award. \"114*\n\n*MINE, supra* note 15, para. 6,101, *\"The Tribunal either failed to consider them, or it did consider them but thought that Guinea's arguments should be rejected. But that did not free the Tribunal from its duty to give reasons for its rejection as an indispensable component of the statement of reasons on which its conclusion was based.\" See* also *Klockner (I), supra* note 14, paras. 141, 151, 164; *MINE,* para. 6,108.\n\nMemorial, para. 60.\n\n*Wena v. Egypt, supra* note 15, para. 101. *See also, MINE, supra note* 15, para. 6.99.\n\n67.\n\nAccording to Article 48(3) of the Washington Convention, *\"[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\"* The obligation in Article 48(3) of the Washington Convention to deal with every question applies to every argument which is relevant and in particular to arguments which might affect the outcome of the case. On the other hand, it would be unreasonable to require a tribunal to answer each and every argument which was made in connection with the issues that the tribunal has to decide, as acknowledged in the *Klockner (I)* decision.115 This explains why the tribunal must address all the parties\u2019 \"questions\" *(\"pretensiones\")* but is not required to comment on all arguments when they are of no relevance to the award.\n\n*Klockner (I), supra note* 14, para. 131.\n\n68.\n\nThe *Wena v. Egypt* Committee also declared that Article 48(3) makes a distinction between the tribunal's duty to deal with every question submitted to it and the requirement that the award shall state the reasons upon which it is based: *\"The ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) only refers to the latter element. In case a Tribunal has omitted to decide a question in the award, a party may request the Tribunal to decide such question, in an additional proceeding pursuant to Article 49(2) which is distinct from an annulment proceeding under Article* 52.\"116 The remedy in case of an omission to decide a question is not therefore always a request for the annulment of the award; there is another remedy in Article 49(2) of the Washington Convention when there is an omission or error that can be corrected without reconsideration of the tribunal's award.\n\n*Wena v. Egypt, supra* note 15, para. 100.\n\n69.\n\nAccording to Article 49(2) of the Washington Convention, a request for a supplementary decision or correction has to be made within 45 days of the date when the award was rendered. The relationship between the annulment proceedings and the proceedings for completion or correction of an award has been analyzed in the *Amco I* decision. The *ad hoc* Committee stated that the obligation set out in Article 48(3) of the Convention can find its sanction under Article 52(1)(e) while Article 49 offers a remedy for unintentional omissions to decide any question.117 In the present case, the Applicants did not initiate Article 49(2) proceedings, as pointed out by the Republic of Ecuador.118 Answering a question from the Committee as to why they had not asked the Tribunal to render a supplementary decision, the Applicants explained that the findings of the Tribunal were an insurmountable obstacle to an application under Article 49(2).119\n\n*Amco I, supra note* 15, paras. 32-34.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 30.\n\nTr. pp. 175-176, 197-199.\n\n70.\n\nIn their Notice for arbitration, M.C.I, and New Turbine specified that their request concerned an *\"investment dispute\"* within the meaning of Article VI of the BIT.120 They stated in their Memorial that the Tribunal had jurisdiction under Article VI(2) of the BIT to hear their claim *\"to pay sums properly due and owing under the Contract and to provide compensation upon expropriation.\"121* M.C.I, and New Turbine claimed damages of US$ 24,242,784 in total for losses from the Seacoast Contract,122 and they submitted that Ecuador had acted in a manner inconsistent with the umbrella clause of Article 11(3)(c) of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, which states that *\"[e]ach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\"* They claimed that Ecuador's actions and omissions constituted a failure to observe its contractual obligations as required by the BIT and international law.123 This submission was reiterated in their Reply.124 There is some confusion between the parties about the introduction of the non-payment of the accounts receivable as a contractual claim before ICSID,125 while claims based on breach of the Seacoast Contract had already been raised against INECEL before the Administrative Court of the District of Quito on July 31, 1996.126 In elevating the breach of a contractual obligation to treaty level, an umbrella clause increases the Contracting States' accountability, and this is particularly the case when the contract is signed by a State entity, such as here, INECEL, which the Tribunal recognized as an organ of the Republic of Ecuador.127 When an umbrella clause exists, such as in the U.S.-Ecuador BIT in Article 11(3), the distinction between a treaty claim and a contract claim loses much of its interest. In oral argument, the Republic of Ecuador specifically stated that the Tribunal decided all questions regarding both treaty-based and contract-based claims.128\n\nNotice for arbitration, para. 13.\n\nClaimants' arbitration Memorial, para. 275(c) and (d).\n\n*Id.,* para. 519.\n\n*Id,* para. 522(i)\n\nClaimants' arbitration Reply, para. 275(b).\n\nTr. pp. 121-125, 202-206.\n\nAward, para. 205.\n\n*Id,* para. 225.\n\nTr. p. 125.\n\n71.\n\nThe Applicants seek to have the Award annulled with reference to Article VI(1)(c) as well as Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT, and it appears from the following passage of the Award that the Tribunal took cognizance of alleged Treaty breaches as well as contractual breaches: *\"The Tribunal is aware that in the proceedings commenced before the Ecuadorian courts, Seacoast claimed for contractual breaches under the Seacoast Contract and the Clarification Contract. On the other hand, the present action submitted to the ICSID by the Claimants is based on breach of contract and of the BIT and takes account of events before, as well as after, the submission of the claim to the Ecuadorian courts.\"129* In fact, according to Article VI(4) of the BIT,130 the treaty-based Tribunal has competence on *\"any investment dispute,\"* regardless of the legal basis of the claim. As regards its jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided *\"1. To allow the Respondent's main objections to the Tribunal's Competence in respect of the non-retroactivity of the BIT; and 2. To reject the objections to the Tribunal's Competence with respect to the non-existence of an investment and the preclusion of the fork-in-the-road\u2019 provision and consequently exercise its Competence over the Respondent's alleged violations of the BIT by acts or omissions after the entry into force of the BIT.\"*131 The Applicants\u2019 complaint is nonetheless that the Tribunal failed to address the issue of jurisdiction over their claims for the outstanding accounts receivable and for breach of the contract, which, they affirm, is an issue of sufficient significance, with the consequence that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the Award is based.\n\nAward, para. 188.\n\nArticle VI(4) of the BIT provides that: *\"Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration [...].\"*\n\nAward, para. 191.\n\n72.\n\nAs the Applicants emphasized in their oral argument, Article VI(2) which offers investors jurisdictional alternatives, including ICSID arbitration, presupposes that there must be an investment dispute before a claim can be raised.132 Article VI(4) of the BIT allows the submission to arbitration of *\"any investment dispute\"* within the broad meaning of Article VI(1), regardless of whether the investment dispute is based on a violation of the BIT as envisaged by Article VI(1)(c) or originates in a violation of contract as foreseen by Article VI(1)(a). M.C.I, and New Turbine alleged in the arbitration that Seacoast and its intangible assets in Ecuador were an investment before and after the entry into force of the Treaty.133 Ecuador replied that the requirements of the BIT and of Article 25 of the Washington Convention were not met, the concept of investment not being defined, or not being defined with precision, in either the Washington Convention or the BIT.134 As pointed out in the Award,135 Seacoast had filed a suit with the Ecuadorian administrative courts on July 31, 1996 to request damages of approximately US$ 24.2 million for breach of contract. The claim included payment for available energy under the \"take or pay\" contract, payment for fuel consumed which had not been settled, return of amounts improperly withheld for fines, payment of interest and damages sustained. The \"accounts receivable\" are financial claims connected with the Applicants' investment, and the Tribunal accepted that they fall in principle under the definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(a) of the BIT. This Article contains the following language: *\"(a) \u2018investment\u2019 means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes: (i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges; (ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof; (iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment; (iv) intellectual property [...] (v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law [...].\"* The Tribunal thus interpreted Article 1(a) of the BIT as giving a broad definition of investment and decided that the rights and interests alleged by the Applicants to have subsisted after the entry into force of the BIT, including the intangible assets of \"accounts receivable,\" would fit that definition.136 The inclusion of their claims within the definition of *\"investment\"* in Article 1(a) did not mean that the \"accounts receivable\" were necessarily valid legal claims. Whether or not this was the case was in dispute between the parties. This did not exclude the Tribunal's competence but would be a matter to be examined at the stage of the merits of the proceedings. Indeed, the Tribunal found that *\"for purposes of determining if it has Competence it is sufficient to consider the events as alleged by the Claimants insofar and inasmuch as, if proven true, they would constitute a breach of the BIT.\"137*\n\nTr. p. 204.\n\nAward, para. 39.\n\n*Id,* paras. 137-146. In its ruling in favor of M.C.I, and New Turbine on that count, the Tribunal answered the arguments of Ecuador that the existence of an investment presupposes certain conditions when it clarified that *\"the requirements that were taken into account in some* *arbitral precedents for purposes of denoting an investment protected by a treaty (such as the duration and risk of the alleged investment) must be considered as mere examples and not necessarily as elements that are required for its existence\"* and that *\"[nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the very elements of the Seacoast project and the consequences thereof fall within the characterizations required in order to determine the existence of protected investments.\"* (para. 165).\n\n*Id,* paras. 205 and 342.\n\n*Id,* para. 164.\n\n*Id,* para. 163.\n\n73.\n\nWhen addressing the question of the temporal application of the BIT to the investments of Seacoast in Ecuador, the Tribunal remarked that *\"[t]he Claimants' arguments with respect to the relevance of prior events considered to be breaches of the Treaty posit a contradiction since, before the entry into force of the BIT, there was no possibility of breaching it.\"138* While recognizing that the subsistence of an investment on the date of entry into force of the BIT should be taken into account, the Tribunal did not conclude that it had competence over all claims of M.C.I, and New Turbine. The claims for breach of the Seacoast Contract, which included the failure to pay the alleged USS 24.2 million outstanding accounts receivable that was presented to the Liquidation Commission sitting between April 1997 and March 1999,139 had arisen before the entry into force of the BIT as recognized in the statement of the Tribunal in paragraph 277 of the Award where it considered *\"that the failure to agree on liquidation of the Contract was due to the prior existence of an unresolved dispute between the parties.\"*\n\n*Id,* para. 93.\n\nM., paras. 209, 212.\n\n74.\n\nThe Award records the allegation of M.C.I, and New Turbine that Ecuador breached its BIT obligations by continuing and composite wrongful acts.140 The Applicants' argument is more specifically expounded in paragraph 70 of the Award: *\"Ecuador's final refusal to pay occurred when the Liquidation Commission proceedings were considered terminated, after the BIT had entered into force. That Commission was an integral element of the Seacoast Contract. Therefore, the Claimants argue, expropriation of Seacoast's contractual rights was only complete after the Liquidation Commission proceedings were concluded.\"* The Award also notes that Ecuador disagreed and replied that the dispute concerning the payment of amounts supposedly owed by INECEL to Seacoast had no relation at all to the concept of an internationally wrongful act or to wrongful acts of a continuing character and asserted that the offence alleged by the Claimants was consummated prior to the entry into force of the BIT in a completed act by which INECEL refused to recognize the rights claimed by Seacoast.141\n\n*Id.,* para. 69.\n\n*Id,* paras. 79-81.\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal examined the ILC Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts which had been invoked by M.C.I, and New Turbine,142 in particular Articles 14 and 15 thereof.143 It explained that wrongful acts must be internationally wrongful acts which, in its view, meant that *\"they must be identified with the violation of a norm of international law\"144* existing at the time when the act extending in time begins or when it is consummated.145 It further found that *\"[t]he non-retroactivity of treaties as a general rule postulates that only from the entry into force of an international obligation does the latter give rise to rights and obligations for the parties\"* and that *\"[t]herefore, for any internationally wrongful act to be considered as consummated, continuing, or composite, there must be a breach of a norm of international law attributed to a State.\"146* In addition, the Tribunal examined the possible breach of a norm of customary international law before the entry into force of the BIT, but concluded, by reference to the NAFTA award in *Mondev v. United States* which distinguished from a substantive and procedural point of view between a NAFTA claim and a diplomatic protection claim for conduct contrary to customary international law, that the existence of such breach before a BIT enters into force would not give M.C.I, and New Turbine a right to have recourse to the treaty-based Tribunal.147 Closing the discussion on the existence of continuing and composite acts, the Tribunal decided that *\"[f]or the above reasons, and in accordance* *with the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties, the Tribunal holds that the acts and omissions alleged by the Claimants as being prior to the entry into force of the BIT do not constitute continuing and composite wrongful acts under the BIT.\"148*\n\n*Id,* para. 71.\n\n*Id,* paras. 86-92.\n\n*Id,* para. 90.\n\n*Id,* para. 82.\n\n*Id,* para. 94.\n\n*Id,* para. 96.\n\n*Id.,* para. 97.\n\n76.\n\nThere is no reason to believe that the Tribunal's aforementioned conclusion in paragraph 97 did not include the refusal to pay the outstanding accounts receivable and, consequently, the Tribunal cannot be considered to have failed to give reasons in this respect. The *ad hoc* Committee in *Wena v. Egypt* declared: *\"Neither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal's reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the Parties will be able to understand the Tribunal's reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The Tribunal's reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms in the decision [...]. It is in the nature of this ground of annulment that in case the award suffers from a lack of reasons which can be challenged within the meaning and scope of Article 52(1)(e), the remedy need not be the annulment of the award. The purpose of this particular ground for annulment is not to have the award reversed on its merits. It is to allow the parties to understand the Tribunal's decision. If the award does not meet the minimal requirement as to the reasons given by the Tribunal, it does not necessarily need to be resubmitted to a new Tribunal. If the* ad hoc *Committee so concludes, on the basis of the knowledge it has received upon the dispute, the reasons supporting the Tribunal's conclusions can be explained by the* ad hoc *Committee itself.\"149*\n\n*Wena v. Egypt, supra* note 15, paras. 81 and 83. *See* also *CMS v. Argentina, supra* note 15, paras. 54-57, and *Soufraki v. UAE, supra* note 15, para. 24.\n\n77.\n\nAccording to the above-mentioned passages of the Award on continuing and composite acts,150 the Tribunal opined that the existence of such acts would have required a breach of the BIT, and this would not have been possible before the Treaty came into force on May 11, 1997. In addition, the breach of another norm of international law existing before the entry into force of the BIT would not, according to the Tribunal, have given a right to recourse to the BIT\u2019s arbitral jurisdiction.151 The Tribunal\u2019s finding that the acts and omissions accepted by the Claimants as being prior to the entry into force of the BIT did not constitute continuing and composite wrongful acts under the BIT152 would seem to imply acceptance of Ecuador\u2019s view that the refusal to pay the accounts receivable was an instantaneous and not a continuing act. While this is not clearly stated in the Award, it can be deduced from the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning. Thus, the Tribunal's finding that acts and omissions prior to May 11, 1997 cannot constitute continuing and composite wrongful acts under the BIT was *\"not bereft of any reference to the specific issue of the outstanding accounts receivable* *claim,\"* as alleged by the Applicants.153 It is of course another matter whether or not the reasons given by the Tribunal were convincing.\n\nAward, paras. 82-97.\n\n*Id,* para. 96.\n\n*Id,* para. 97.\n\nMemorial, para. 75.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal ended the discussion on acts and omissions prior to the entry into force of the BIT by stating: *\"This Tribunal, following the opinion of the ILC in its Commentaries on the customary norms set out in Articles 13, 14 and 15 of its Draft Articles on State Responsibility, will take into account events prior to the date of entry into force of the BIT solely in order to understand and determine precisely the scope and effects of the breaches of the BIT after that date. [...] The Tribunal reiterates its views on the possibility of exercising Competence over all acts or omissions alleged by the Claimants to have occurred after the entry into force of the BIT and as having been in violation thereof. Acts or omissions prior to the entry into force of the BIT may be taken into account by the Tribunal in cases in which those acts or omissions are relevant as background, causal link, or the basis of circumstances surrounding the occurrence of a dispute from the time the wrongful act was consummated after the entry into force of the norm that had been breached. The Tribunal, however, finds that it has no Competence to determine damages for acts that do not qualify as violations of the BIT as they occurred prior to its entry into force.\"154*\n\nAward, paras. 135-136.\n\n79.\n\nThe opinion of the Tribunal, which it expressed in the discussion of Ecuador's subsidiary objection on the existence of an investment, contains the following statement: *\"[...] the principle of non-retroactivity of treaties limits the application of the BIT and its clauses on jurisdiction to those disputes that are alleged to be violations of that Treaty after it entered into force. [...] For all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that claims relating to the Seacoast Contract and the Clarification Contract, as well as the Ecuapower Contract, could not involve breaches under the BIT as the latter was not in force at the time that those alleged contractual breaches occurred. Applying the customary rules relating to State Responsibility, the contractual breaches prior to the entry into force of the BIT do not contain the elements necessary to amount to violations of the BIT. [...] Regarding the events alleged by the Claimants to be breaches of the BIT after it entered into force, the Tribunal finds that the effects of an investment that was in existence before the treaty entered into force, continued,* prima facie, *after that date. The Tribunal, therefore, has Competence to hear the Claimants' arguments alleging breaches of the BIT by Ecuador for acts or omissions after it entered into force, which affected their investment. \"155*\n\n*Id.,* paras. 167-169.\n\n80.\n\nThe Applicants allege that the Tribunal's analysis *\"was restricted to a wholly esoteric discussion on the law of composite and continuing acts\"*156 However, for the purposes of Article 52(1)(e) of the Washington Convention, it is sufficient to point out that the Tribunal must be considered to have answered the Applicants\u2019 argument regarding continuing breaches by indicating that, in the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, there was no continuing or composite act in respect of the refusal to pay the alleged accounts receivable. The Applicants actually criticize the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of continuing and composite acts and propose another interpretation of the ILC Articles than that of the Tribunal. This Committee cannot from such a divergence of opinions conclude that the Tribunal failed to state reasons in its Award.\n\nMemorial, para. 76.\n\n81.\n\nIn the context of Article 52(1)(e), the **ad hoc** Committee *va MINE* declared as follows: *\"The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e), because it almost inevitably draws an* ad hoc *Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal's decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention. A Committee might be tempted to annul an award because that examination disclosed a manifestly incorrect application of the law, which, however, is not a ground for annulment.\"157* In *Vivendi v. Argentina,* also, the **ad hoc** Committee carefully observed: *\"A greater source of concern is perhaps the ground of failure to state reasons ; which is not qualified by any such phrase as \u2018manifestly\u2019 or \u2018serious\u2019. However, it is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. It bears reiterating that an* ad hoc *committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning. [...] In the Committee's view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision.\"158*\n\n*MINE, supra* note 15, para. 5.08.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina, supra* note 15, paras. 64-65.\n\n82.\n\nContrary to the Applicants' complaint, the Tribunal answered that it had no jurisdiction to entertain claims relating to disputes arising before May 11, 1997 and gave reasons for this conclusion. In the examination of the present case in relation to Article 52(1)(e) of the Washington Convention, the Committee cannot review this conclusion, or express its agreement or disagreement with it, or examine whether or not the reasons given by the Tribunal are convincing. According to the *CDC v. Seychelles* Committee, Article 52(1)(e) *\"does not provide us with the opportunity to opine on whether the Tribunal\u2019s analysis was correct or its reasoning persuasive.\"159* Further, as stressed by the **ad hoc** Committee in *Wena v. Egypt, \"[t]he ground for annulment of Article 52(1)(e) does not allow any review of the challenged Award which would lead the* ad hoc *Committee to reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal's decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not.\"160* The **ad hoc** committee can only take the award as it is,161 it may not substitute its judgment for that of the tribunal. Otherwise, this would make the award the commencement and not the end of litigation.\n\n*CDC v. Seychelles, supra* note 87, para. 70.\n\n*Wena v. Egypt, supra* note 15, para. 79.\n\n*Klockner (I), supra note* 14, para. 73.\n\n83.\n\nInsofar as the Applicants allege that the Tribunal did not state reasons for declining jurisdiction in respect of their contractual claims, it should be noted that the Tribunal, when commenting on the Applicants\u2019 alleged \"fork-in-the-road\" choice, stated that, in accordance with the principle of the non-retroactivity of treaties, the contractual disputes which had been submitted to the Ecuadorian courts remained outside the Tribunal\u2019s temporal competence.162 It thus appears from the Award that the Tribunal\u2019s reasons for declining jurisdiction in regard to the BIT claim also applied to the contractual claims. Once the Tribunal decided that it did not have temporal jurisdiction, its decision applied to all claims concerning acts or omissions prior to the entry into force of the BIT, regardless of whether the claim was based on the Treaty or on contract. Consequently, no lack of reasons can be found in this regard.\n\nAward, para. 189.\n\n84.\n\n*Ad hoc* committees have considered that insufficient, inadequate or contradictory reasons may be assimilated to a failure to state reasons. The *Klockner (I) ad hoc* Committee, for example, declared: *\"The text of* [Article 52(1)(e)] *requires a statement of reasons on which the award is based. This does not mean just any reasons, purely formal or apparent, but rather reasons having some substance, allowing the reader to follow the arbitral tribunal's reasoning, on facts and on law. [...] [T]here would be a* *failure to state reasons\u2019 in the absence of a statement of reasons that are \u2018sufficiently relevant\u2019; that is, reasonably sustainable and capable of providing a basis for the decision.\"163* The decision of the **ad hoc** Committee in *MINE* also stated: *\"The Committee is of the opinion that the requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. [...] In the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.\"164* In *Soufraki v. UAE,* the **ad hoc** Committee added that there may be a ground for annulment in the case of *\"a total absence of reasons for the award, including the giving of merely frivolous reasons; a total failure to state reasons for a particular point, which is material for the solution; contradictory reasons; and insufficient or inadequate reasons, which are insufficient to bring about the solution or inadequate to explain the result arrived at by the Tribunal.\"165*\n\n*Klockner (I), supra* note 14, paras. 119-120. *See* also *Amco I, supra* note 15, para. 43, *\"Stated a little differently, there must be a reasonable connection between the bases invoked by a tribunal and the conclusions reached by it. The phrase \u2018sufficiently pertinent reasons\u2019 appears to this* ad hoc *Committee to be a simple and useful clarification of the term \u2018reasons\u2019 used in the Convention.\"*\n\n*MINE, supra* note 15, paras. 5.08-5.09. *See* also *CMS v. Argentina, supra* note 15, paras. 55, 97; *Patrick Mitchell v. Congo, supra* note 15, para. 21; and *Lucchetti v. Peru, supra note* 15, para. 127.\n\n*Soufraki v. UAE, supra note* 15, para. 126.\n\n85.\n\nHowever, contradictory reasons should be distinguished from reasons which are claimed to be legally or factually wrong, the latter escaping, as already pointed out, from review by an ****ad hoc**** committee. The ****ad hoc**** Committee in *Klockner (I)* explained: *\"As for \u2018contradiction of reasons\u2019, it is in principle appropriate to bring this notion under the category failure to state reasons\u2019 for the very simple reasons that two genuinely contradictory reasons cancel each other out. Hence the failure to state reasons. The arbitrator's obligation to state reasons which are not contradictory must therefore be accepted.\"166* In *MTD v. Chile,* the ****ad hoc**** Committee opined that *\"outright or unexplained contradictions can involve a failure to state reasons.\"167* In *Vivendi v. Argentina,* the ****ad hoc**** Committee cautiously declared: *\"It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an* ad hoc *committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal's reasons could more truly be said to be a reflection of such conflicting considerations.\"168*\n\n*Klockner (I), supra* note 14, para. 116. *See* also *Soufraki v. UAE, supra* note 15, paras. 122, 125; and *CMS v. Argentina, supra* note 15, para. 54.\n\n*MTD* v. *Chile, supra* note 10, para. 78.\n\n*Vivendi v. Argentina, supra* note 15, para. 65. *See also* *MTD v. Chile, supra* note 10, para. 50; and *CMS v. Argentina, supra* note 15, para. 54.\n\n86.\n\nThe Applicants consider that the Award rests on contradictory reasons because none of the reasons given by the Tribunal can be identified as an adequate ground for its conclusion. However, to the extent that the Applicants' complaint is based on an alleged improper interpretation and application by the Tribunal of Article 28 of the Vienna Convention, it is not within the ambit of Article 52(1)(e) but that of Article 52(1)(b). The Award may reflect reasoning and contain a conclusion that is legally correct or incorrect, but the Committee\u2019s opinion on this matter is irrelevant for the scrutiny of the award under Article 52(1)(e) of the Washington Convention. The Tribunal answered - rightly or wrongly but without any apparent contradiction - the parties' respective contentions on jurisdiction regarding the accounts receivable, which is sufficient for the purposes of Article 52(1)(e).\n\n87.\n\nHaving found itself without competence to deal with the Applicants\u2019 claims regarding the accounts receivable, the Tribunal also implicitly rejected as a necessary consequence all factual or legal implications of these claims and examined only other acts subsequent to May 11, 1997.169 In doing so, the Tribunal must be considered to have answered the arguments of the Applicants in respect of their accounts receivable claim, whether based on Treaty or contract. The Committee has not found that the Tribunal overlooked any particular point affecting the outcome of the Award. Consequently, the Committee finds no reason for annulling the Award on the basis of Article 52(1)(e) of the Washington Convention.\n\nAward, paras. 95, 226-229.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n88.\n\nThe parties have submitted their cost claims upon the invitation of the *ad hoc* Committee at the hearing and each party maintains that the other should be required to meet the total costs. It appears from Article 53 of the Washington Convention that an award becomes immediately binding on the parties who are therefore required to abide by and comply with its terms. The annulment action under Article 52 is an extraordinary means of recourse and cannot be considered as a normal continuation of the arbitration. At the financial level, in derogation from the rule that advances on costs are equally shared between the parties in arbitration proceedings, Regulation 14(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations directs the applicant for annulment to make the whole advance payment to ICSID for the costs referred to in Regulation 14(2) of the said Regulations. A consequence of this rule, which imposes on the party who applies for annulment the financial burden of advancing the costs, should normally be that the applicant, when annulment is refused, remains responsible for these costs. In the present case, the *ad hoc* Committee therefore finds that M.C.I, and New Turbine shall finally bear the full costs and expenses incurred by ICSID in connection with this annulment proceeding.170\n\nSee *CDC v. Seychelles, supra* note 87, para. 90; *Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v. Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (Petroecuador)* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/10), Decision on Annulment, January 8, 2007, para. 88.\n\n89.\n\nThe Committee acknowledges that the annulment case was presented by both parties in an efficient and courteous manner and recognizes the great assistance it received from counsel on both sides. The parties\u2019 own costs for their representation are comparable in size, and there is no element in the conduct of the proceedings by either side that should justify an uneven division of these costs. The *ad hoc* Committee finds that each party shall bear its own costs for legal representation and expenses in the annulment proceeding.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the *ad hoc* Committee decides:\n\n(1) to reject, pursuant to Article 52(1) of the Washington Convention, the application for annulment of the ICSID Tribunal's Award of July 31, 2007 (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6),\n\n(2) that M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine Inc. shall jointly bear the full costs incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding,\n\n(3) that each Party shall bear its own costs for legal representation and expenses in the annulment proceeding."}]}
