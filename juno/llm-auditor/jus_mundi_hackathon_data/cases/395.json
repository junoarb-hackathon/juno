Gianina Osejo at the office of the State\u2019s Attorney General; Mr. Mark Clodfelter, Dr. Ronald Goodman, Dr. Alberto Wray, Mr. Ignacio Torterola, Dr. Constantinos Salonidis and Ms. Diana Tsutieva of Foley Hoag LLP in Washington, D.C.; and Messrs. Bruno Leurent, Thomas Bevilacqua and Ms. Angelynn Meya of Foley Hoag LLP in Paris.\n\n**II. RELEVANT LEGAL PROVISIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nClaimant commenced these proceedings against Ecuador by Notice of Arbitration dated 21 September 2011 pursuant to Article VI of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the **\"BIT\"** or **\"Treaty\").**\n\n4.\n\nArticle VI of the BIT provides:\n\n1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party\u2019s foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedures; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\"), provided that the Party is a party to such Convention; or\n\n(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or\n\n(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or\n\n(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(b) once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.\n\n4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:\n\n(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for Purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and\n\n(b) an \"agreement in writing\" for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958 (\"New York Convention\").\n\n5. Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article shall be held in a state that is a party to the New York Convention.\n\n5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s claims implicate, *inter alia,* the following articles of the Treaty:\n\n(i) Article 11(1) (national treatment and most-favoured-nation provision):\n\n1. Each Party shall permit and treat investment, and activities associated therewith, on a basis no less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investment or associated activities of its own nationals or companies, or of nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the most favorable, subject to the right of each Party to make or maintain exceptions falling within one of the sectors or matters listed in the Protocol to this Treaty. Each Party agrees to notify the other Party before or on the date of entry into force of this Treaty of all such laws and regulations of which it is aware concerning the sectors or matters listed in the Protocol. Moreover, each Party agrees to notify the other of any future exception with respect to the sectors or matters listed in the Protocol, and to limit such exceptions to a minimum. Any future exception by either Party shall not apply to investment existing in that sector or matter at the time the exception becomes effective. The treatment accorded pursuant to any exceptions shall, unless specified otherwise in the Protocol, be not less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments and associated activities of nationals or companies of any third country.\n\n(ii) Article II(3)(c) (umbrella clause):\n\nEach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\n\n(iii) Article X (taxation matters):\n\n1. With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the other Party.\n\n2. Nevertheless, the provisions of this treaty, and in particular Article VI and VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;\n\n(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VI (1) (a) or (b), to the extent they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable period of time.\n\n6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s request for bifurcation of these proceedings implicates Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976, which provides:\n\nIn general, the arbitral tribunal should rule on a plea concerning its jurisdiction as a preliminary question. However, the arbitral tribunal may proceed with the arbitration and rule on such a plea in their final award.\n\n**III. BACKGROUND**\n-------------------\n\n**Factual background to the dispute**\n-------------------------------------\n\n7.\n\nWhat follows is a brief factual background to this dispute set out for the purposes of providing context to the present decision by the Presiding Arbitrator on Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation. It should not be taken to be indicative of any factual finding on the part of the Tribunal in this case.\n\n8.\n\nIn 1985, following a bidding process, the Ecuadorian government retained the services of a consortium of oil companies led by Conoco Ecuador Limited **(\"Conoco\")** to exploit the petroleum resources in a zone of Ecuador\u2019s Amazon Region known as Block 16.\n\n9.\n\nAccording to Claimant, its original investment in Ecuador commenced in 1987 when it, through its subsidiaries, indirectly acquired from Conoco a 20% aggregate interest in the Service Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 16 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region **(\"Service Contract\").1** Following this acquisition, Murphy became part of the Consortium formed by Conoco Ecuador Ltd, Overseas Petroleum and Investment Corporation, Diamond Shamrock South America Petroleum B.V., and Nomeco Latin American Inc. **(\"Consortium\").2** Under the Service Contract, the Consortium received a set fee for their services in extracting oil, with all of the resulting production belonging to the State.3\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 3; Statement of Claim, para. 4 and paras. 54-57, 70-74; Objections to Jurisdiction, para.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 3; Statement of Claim, para. 69; Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 13.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 3.\n\n10.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, pursuant to a public deed executed in Quito on 28 July 1987, Conoco assigned 10% of its rights and obligations under the Service Contract to each of Murphy Ecuador Oil Company Limited **(\"Murphy Ecuador\")** and its immediate parent company, Canam Offshore Limited (**Canam),** which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Claimant.4 Canam was organised under the laws of the Bahamas and Murphy Ecuador was organised under the laws of Bermuda.5\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 15\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 16.\n\n11.\n\nThe Service Contract was in force until December 1996 at which time the Consortium and Ecuador executed the Modification of the Service Contract into a Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block 16 of the Amazon Region of Ecuador **(\"Participation Contract\").6** Under the Participation Contract, the Consortium received a percentage of its production of oil and the right to freely market its share.7 The Participation Contract was intended to remain in force until 31 January 2012.8 According to Claimant, through its subsidiaries, it indirectly owned 20% of the rights and obligations under the Participation Contract.9\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 5; Statement of Claim, para. 5 and paras. 58-62, 68, 78-131; Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 19-25.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 5; Statement of Claim, para. 2.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 3.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 5.\n\n12.\n\nFrom the early 2000s, global oil prices rose sharply and led to dramatic increases in revenue for oil companies.\n\n13.\n\nIn April 2006, Ecuador passed Law 42,10 an amendment to its Hydrocarbons Law, under which the Consortium was obliged to pay an \"additional participation\" of at least 50%.11\n\nLaw No. 42, Official Gazette No. 257 (Supplement), Apr. 25, 2006, **CEX-47.**\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 7; Statement of Claim, paras. 8-9, 132-141; Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 29-38.\n\n14.\n\nOn 11 July 2006, Ecuador issued Decree No. 1672, a regulatory decree that formally set the payment percentage of the additional participation at 50%.12\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 8, 30; Statement of Claim, paras. 10, 145.\n\n15.\n\nIn October 2007, Ecuador issued Decree No. 662, a further regulatory decree that increased the additional participation to 99%.13\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 30; Statement of Claim, paras. 10, 146; Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 36.\n\n16.\n\nClaimant contends that it and the other members of the Consortium asserted their right to have the Participation Contract enforced according to its original terms and, for a time, made Law 42 payments under protest. It states that it paid over USD118 million in protest.14 Ecuador contends that Claimant became the sole dissenting member of the Consortium with regard to the continuance of operations in Block 16.15\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 9; Statement of Claim, paras. 179-181.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 40.\n\n17.\n\nOn 29 February 2008, Claimant notified the Government that a dispute had arisen in April 2006 with the introduction of Law 42, and that Murphy would seek international arbitration under the BIT.16 Claimant contends that the six-month notice period provided for at Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT expired in or around October 2006.17\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 31; Murphy\u2019s Letter to Ecuador dated 29 February 2009, **Exhibit C-4.**\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 31.\n\n**Procedural history of previous ICSID proceedings**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn March 2008, Claimant initiated ICSID proceedings under the Treaty **(\"ICSID Arbitration\").18** Shortly thereafter, Murphy Ecuador initiated a separate ICSID arbitration together with the Consortium members relating to the same facts (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/10) **(\"Murphy Ecuador ICSID Arbitration\").19**\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 31.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, paras. 41,49.\n\n19.\n\nAfter May 2008, Claimant alleges that Ecuador forced investors to convert their participation contracts into new service contracts or risk having their contracts unilaterally terminated by the Government and being forced to abandon their investment in Ecuador altogether.20 As a result, on 12 March 2009, Murphy sold its interest in the Participation Contract to the Consortium\u2019s operator, Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A., at what it describes as a substantially diminished value, and without compensation for the USD118 million that Murphy had already paid under protest.21 Respondent contends that Claimant sold its investment at no loss.22\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 10-11; Statement of Claim, paras. 182-201.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 11; Statement of Claim, paras. 12, 202-209.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 51.\n\n20.\n\nThe tribunal in the ICSID Arbitration was fully constituted in October 2008 **(\"ICSID Tribunal\").** Those proceedings lasted approximately 3.5 years during which time the parties fully pleaded their respective positions on jurisdiction and the merits.\n\n21.\n\nOn 15 December 2010, an Award on Jurisdiction **(\"ICSID Award on Jurisdiction\")23** was issued in the ICSID Arbitration in which the majority found that it did not have jurisdiction over the dispute. According to Claimant, that tribunal \"rejected all of Ecuador\u2019s remaining objections to jurisdiction by finding that they were not questions of jurisdiction but should only be considered during the merits phase. Thus...the only bar to a new tribunal\u2019s having jurisdiction over the present dispute was the majority\u2019s finding that Murphy had not consulted and negotiated with Ecuador for a six-month period before filing for arbitration.\"24\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International* v. *Republic of* Ecuador, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award on Jurisdiction, December 15, 2010, **Exhibit C-3.**\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 38.\n\n22.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, on 23 November 2010, the Consortium, which included Murphy Ecuador, reached a final settlement with Ecuador. In exchange for a new Modification Contract to the Block 16 Participation Contract (replacing the Participation Contract with a Service Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbon), Murphy Ecuador and the other Consortium members agreed to withdraw with prejudice all of the claims made in the Murphy Ecuador ICSID Arbitration.25\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 46.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 30 December 2010, Murphy invited Ecuador to participate in consultations and negotiations regarding their dispute under the Treaty.26 By letter dated 31 January 2011, Ecuador responded stating, *inter alia,* that the \"six-month period begins to run only from January 3, 2011.\"27\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 38.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 38.\n\n24.\n\nBetween February and July 2011, the Parties exchanged correspondence and met to discuss the dispute, but no resolution was reached as a result of these efforts.28\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 39-47; Statement of Claim, paras. 32-42.\n\n25.\n\nOn 13 July 2011, Murphy filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID, to which Ecuador filed jurisdictional objections. Murphy states that it later \"accepted Ecuador\u2019s offer to submit this dispute to a non-ICSID alternative\u2014specifically to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules\u2014, with a view to avoiding further jurisdictional delays.\" On 19 August 2011, Murphy withdrew its Request for Arbitration from ICSID.29\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 49; Statement of Claim, paras. 43-44.\n\n**Procedural history of these proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nBy a Notice of Arbitration dated 21 September 2011, Claimant commenced these proceedings against Ecuador under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976.\n\n27.\n\nOn 14 March 2012, Claimant appointed Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r as arbitrator. On 12 April 2012, Ecuador appointed Professor Georges Abi-Saab as arbitrator. On 25 May 2012, the co-arbitrators jointly appointed Professor Bernard Hanotiau as presiding arbitrator.\n\n28.\n\nThe Parties and Tribunal agreed Terms of Appointment that were signed on 3 September 2012.\n\n29.\n\nA procedural hearing was held by teleconference on 19 July 2012, following which the Presiding Arbitrator signed Procedural Order No. 1 on behalf of the Tribunal. This set forth, *inter alia,* the procedural timetable for the first phase of these proceedings.\n\n30.\n\nOn 17 September 2012, Claimant filed a Statement of Claim **(\"Statement of Claim\")** accompanied by (1) the witness statement of Ignacio Herrera; (2) the expert report of Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose and annexes; (3) the expert report of Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA, with attachments; and (4) exhibits CEX-1 to CEX-167 and legal authorities CLA-001-CLA-108. Relevant Spanish translations were dispatched by courier on 15 October 2012, along with English translations of selected documents and a corrected Statement of Claim, Errata Sheet and missing exhibits (including CEX-168).\n\n31.\n\nOn 18 October 2012, Ecuador submitted its Objections to Jurisdiction **(\"Objections to Jurisdiction\")** accompanied by exhibits REX-1 to REX-33 and legal authorities RLA-1 to RLA-194. In it, Respondent requested the Tribunal to \"bifurcate these proceedings and address in a preliminary fashion the serious jurisdictional issues hereto raised so that they can be separately assessed and resolved at the outset of this dispute.\"30 On 23 October 2012, Ecuador submitted a revised version of this submission (to correct minor errors) and an errata sheet. Relevant Spanish translations were submitted on 15 November 2012.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 321.\n\n32.\n\nOn 16 November 2012, Claimant filed its Response to Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction **(\"Response\")** accompanied by exhibits CEX-169 to CEX-192 and legal authorities CLA-109 to CLA-232. In its cover letter, Claimant set forth its response to Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation.\n\n33.\n\nIn a message dated 17 November 2012, the Parties were informed that Professor Abi-Saab was to undergo surgery in the week beginning 19 November 2012 and thereafter enter a convalescence period through March 2013 during which he would not be able to fulfil his obligations as arbitrator in this case. The Parties were invited to comment on this development, and, in particular, to clarify their positions with respect to the issuance of this decision without the contribution of Professor Abi-Saab.\n\n34.\n\nIn a letter dated 10 December 2012, Respondent offered to stipulate with Claimant that the Presiding Arbitrator take this decision alone. By e-mail of 13 December 2012, Claimant agreed to Respondent\u2019s stipulation. Accordingly, this decision is made by the Presiding Arbitrator alone.\n\n35.\n\nIn addition to brief summaries of, among other things, the Parties\u2019 positions on jurisdiction, this decision contains summaries of the Parties\u2019 pleadings concerning Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation. Such summaries are made and included without prejudice to the Parties\u2019 full pleadings on the issues at hand that the Presiding Arbitrator has taken into account when reaching the present decision.\n\n**IV. SUMMARY OF CLAIMANT\u2019S CLAIMS UNDER THE TREATY**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent\u2019s conduct with respect to its investment in Ecuador violated the Treaty. In particular, Murphy impugns Respondent\u2019s, *inter alia,* enactment of Law 42; promulgation and enforcement of the regulatory degrees without compensation to Murphy; imposition of negotiations on Murphy in an attempt to force it to convert the Participation Contract into a service contract under threat of being expelled from Ecuador; and creating conditions that ultimately forced the sale of Murphy\u2019s investment in Ecuador.31\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 21.\n\n37.\n\nMurphy claims that Ecuador\u2019s violations of its Treaty obligations include, but are not limited to, its duty (1) to accord fair and equitable treatment to investments, (2) to accord full protection and security to investments; (3) to treat Murphy\u2019s investment on a basis no less favourable than that accorded in like situations to nationals; (4) not to impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments; (5) to ensure that Murphy receives national or most-favoured-nation treatment, whichever is better, and (6) not to unlawfully expropriate or nationalise investments.32 Claimant also argues that because Ecuador\u2019s measures also amount to breaches of the Participation Contract, they violate the Treaty\u2019s umbrella clause and constitute breaches of an investment agreement.33\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 22.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 23.\n\n**V. SUMMARY OF RESPONDENT\u2019S JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nRespondent argues that by its earlier election of ICSID arbitration, Claimant exhausted all opportunity afforded to it by the Treaty to arbitrate its claims. It contends that the jurisdictional provisions of Article VI of the Treaty operate as successive forks-in-the-road, precluding Claimant from revisiting its initial election of remedies or having a second election of international arbitration.34 Respondent insists that Article VI of the BIT allows investors a single opportunity to vindicate their claims before an international arbitral tribunal.35 Ecuador rejects Claimant\u2019s reliance on a passage in Ecuador\u2019s objections to Claimant\u2019s second request for ICSID arbitration that reads: \"if an ICSID tribunal declines jurisdiction over a dispute, a party may take that dispute to another forum for a decision on the merits\"; this, Ecuador says, does not signal its agreement to the initiation of this arbitration which it claims is precluded by the wording of the Treaty.36\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 8, pages 16-25.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 60.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 60.\n\n39.\n\nIn addition, Respondent raises the following jurisdictional objections:\n\n(i) **Shareholder claims:** Ecuador argues that Claimant\u2019s claims are really those of its former subsidiary, Murphy Ecuador. All of the losses alleged are the losses of that former subsidiary. Claimant has failed to allege any losses to itself that are distinct and separate from the losses alleged to have been suffered by that former subsidiary. But the latter was never able to claim under the Treaty because it is a national of Bermuda, not the United States. After Claimant caused that subsidiary to be sold to another member of the Consortium, the subsidiary withdrew its own claims from the ICSID arbitration that it had commenced under the concession contract. It did so *with* prejudice, in exchange for a new long term oil production agreement. Claimant lacks standing to pursue those claims here.37\n\n(ii) **Article X of the Treaty:** Ecuador submits that the State Parties expressly excluded from the application of the Treaty, and specifically from arbitration, matters of taxation like the law which informs all of Claimant\u2019s claims. They thereby preserved the broad latitude they enjoy under international law to determine fiscal policy and fund public needs. The only exception to this express exclusion pertinent here is with respect to Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim. Therefore, even if they were not outside of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction because of the first two jurisdictional objections, none of Claimant\u2019s other claims survives this tax-matter exclusion clause. Moreover, Claimant\u2019s threat to invoke the Treaty\u2019s mostfavoured-nation treatment clause to avoid application of the tax-matter exclusion is meritless; the MFN clause is beyond Claimant\u2019s standing and cannot be applied in the manner suggested by Claimant.38\n\n(iii) **Umbrella clause:** According to Ecuador, the claim Claimant raises under the Treaty\u2019s so-called umbrella clause meets none of the tests for its application under the Treaty. The contract obligations at the heart of Claimant\u2019s claim are not the kind of obligations contemplated by the Treaty. That contract does not, as required, include obligations with respect to any investment in Ecuador within the meaning of the Treaty. And in any event, Claimant is not a party to that contract - an essential element of the umbrella clause\u2019s application. Moreover, the Participation Contract includes a dispute settlement clause which removes the contract\u2019s obligations from any possibility of adjudication by this Tribunal.39\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 85.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 10, pages 43-85.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 11, pages 86-115.\n\n**VI. SUMMARY OF CLAIMANT\u2019S RESPONSE TO RESPONDENT\u2019SJURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nClaimant rejects Ecuador\u2019s characterisation of Article VI as containing successive forks in the road.40 It argues that Ecuador\u2019s former position was that Murphy did not have just one choice of forum; indeed, it invited Murphy to withdraw its ICSID claims and institute UNCITRAL proceedings instead. Claimant states that Ecuador is precluded from reversing its position now by principles of estoppel and good faith.41 Claimant characterises the BIT as containing a \"three-prong\" test for UNCITRAL arbitration: i.e., provided that the investor has not submitted the dispute for resolution to (i) \"the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute\", or (ii) \"in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedures,\" and that (iii) six months have elapsed since the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company may consent in writing to a dispute under the UNCITRAL Rules. Murphy claims that it has fully complied with this test.42\n\nResponse, para. 33.\n\nResponse, para. 33, and pages 12-44.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 46-50.\n\n41.\n\nClaimant argues that Ecuador\u2019s remaining objections should be decided with the merits of the case. It claims that the ICSID Tribunal already decided that these objections \"by their nature\" should be resolved together with the merits of the case.43 Claimant contends that the ICSID Tribunal\u2019s decision is *res judicata.44* In addition, Claimant responds to each of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections as follows:\n\n(i) **Shareholder claims:** In response to Ecuador\u2019s argument that Claimant\u2019s claims are really those of its former subsidiary, Murphy Ecuador, Claimant argues that Ecuador ignores the plain terms of the BIT, which protect all forms of covered \"investment,\" including Murphy\u2019s interests in Murphy Ecuador, the local branches, and the Participation Contract. Claimant asserts that arbitral practice on this issue is extensive and uniform. In response to Ecuador\u2019s argument that Murphy Ecuador withdrew its claims from the ICSID arbitration, with prejudice, in exchange for a new long term oil production agreement, Claimant argues that the relevant transaction documents clearly left the BIT claim with Murphy, so there was no claim pertinent to this case for Murphy Ecuador to settle.45\n\n(ii) **Article X of the Treaty:** Claimant describes Ecuador\u2019s argument that Murphy\u2019s claims other than expropriation should be dismissed under Article X of the BIT, which limits disputes over \"measures of taxation\" to claims of expropriation, transfers of returns, or violations of an investment agreement as misplaced. Law 42, Claimant argues, is not a tax, as Ecuador expressly admits. Claimant contends that Ecuador, having deliberately structured Law 42 as a non-tax under domestic law so as to avoid liability under the tax-stabilisation provisions of the Participation Contract, cannot belatedly re-classify Law 42 as a \"tax measure\" so as to avoid liability under the BIT and international law. Such conduct is precluded by the doctrines of estoppel and abuse of rights. In any event, Claimant asserts that there is no basis for dismissing Murphy\u2019s claims on this point because Murphy has asserted that Law 42 is both expropriatory and violative of an investment agreement, either of which would bring the claim within Article X even if Ecuador could permissibly re-classify Law 42 as a tax after the fact (which it cannot do). Further, to the extent necessary, Murphy has invoked the BIT\u2019s MFN clause to obtain the benefits of other Ecuador BITs that provide more favourable treatment to investors by not including a tax carve-out provision like that in Article X of the BIT.46\n\n(iii) **Umbrella clause:** Claimant contests Ecuador\u2019s argument that Murphy\u2019s claim under the BIT\u2019s umbrella clause should be dismissed because Ecuador entered into no \"obligations\" with regard to any \"investment\" of Murphy. This argument, Claimant says, ignores the text of the BIT, which defines \"investment\" broadly and in a non-exclusive manner; it covers Murphy\u2019s interests in, among others, Murphy Ecuador and its branches, as well as the Participation Contract, and the right to ensure the obligations arising therefrom. Similarly, Claimant contends that Ecuador\u2019s argument that there was no \"investment agreement\" between Ecuador and Murphy does not honour the terms of the BIT and imposes additional requirements that do not exist in the BIT itself.47 Claimant argues that while Ecuador makes five objections to this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction under the guise of the umbrella clause, only one is truly a jurisdictional issue: i.e., that the Participation Contract\u2019s dispute settlement provisions bars Murphy from asserting international law claims under the BIT; the others are for the merits.48\n\nResponse, para. 109.\n\nResponse, paras 110-122.\n\nResponse, para. 10, pages 49-71.\n\nResponse, para. 11, pages 72-107.\n\nResponse, para. 12.\n\nResponse, para. 310, pages 107-180.\n\n**VII. RESPONDENT\u2019S REQUEST THAT THESE PROCEEDINGS BE BIFURCATED**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n-----------------------------\n\n42.\n\nRespondent requests that the Tribunal \"bifurcate these proceedings and address in a preliminary fashion the serious jurisdictional issues hereto raised so that they can be separately assessed and resolved at the outset of this dispute.\"49 Respondent argues that States are subject to arbitration only to the extent that they have consented, and that they should not be obliged to defend the merits before a tribunal that lacks jurisdiction or whose jurisdiction has not yet been established.50\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 321.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 322.\n\n43.\n\nRespondent contends that the overarching principle behind a decision to bifurcate is the efficient and effective administration of the arbitral process.51\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, paras. 323-324.\n\n44.\n\nRespondent argues that these principles are reflected in the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976, which, at Article 21(4), establish a presumption in favour of bifurcation.52 Accordingly, Respondent contends that (1) it is for the party opposing bifurcation to demonstrate that the jurisdiction of the tribunal is clear enough to warrant jurisdictional pleas to be joined to the merits;53 and, (2) bifurcation may not be dispensed with \"without good cause\".54\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, paras. 326-327; Respondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, pp. 2-3.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 327.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 4.\n\n45.\n\nEcuador adds that resolving jurisdictional objections in a preliminary fashion is commonplace for ICSID and other international tribunals, and tribunals have virtually unfettered discretion to bifurcate.55 This discretion is informed by a wide variety of factors,56 including (1) efficiency;57 (2) whether jurisdictional issues are intertwined with the merits of the case;58 (3) the possible degree of delay;59 and (4) whether bifurcation facilitates the parties\u2019 ability to fully address issues in an organised fashion.60\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 328.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 329.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, paras. 330, 333.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 331-332.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 333.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 334.\n\n46.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, Ecuador submits that unless the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is clear, there is no need to undertake lengthy and costly proceedings to resolve other issues.61 Ecuador argues that its jurisdictional objections go to the core of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, and, contrary to what Claimant argues, would not involve \"rehashing\" of arguments that have been previously addressed because the present objections were never addressed by the ICSID Tribunal. Ecuador submits that their objections meet any applicable standard of substantiality.62 Ecuador notes that another tribunal addressed whether Law 42 is a tax in the sense of Article X of the BIT as a preliminary matter, and \"decided that several [of] Claimant\u2019s claims were not within [its] jurisdiction\";63 that case, Respondent argues, was greatly narrowed by the tribunal\u2019s decision on jurisdiction.64\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, paras. 330, 333.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 4.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 330; Respondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 5, citing *Burlington Resources Inc.* v *Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5 (formerly *Burlington Resources Inc. and others* v. *Republic of Ecuador & Empresa Estatal Petr\u00f3leos del Ecuador (PetroEcuador)).*\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 6.\n\n47.\n\nEcuador maintains that its objections are not intertwined with the merits and their resolution in no way requires assessment of Claimant\u2019s substantive claims: (1) Ecuador\u2019s objection that Claimant has exhausted its opportunity to arbitrate under the Treaty is a question of interpreting the extent of the State Parties\u2019 consent under the Treaty; (2) Ecuador\u2019s objection concerning Murphy\u2019s claims as shareholder of Murphy Ecuador require no more than the application of recognised legal principles to the claims as they appear on the face of the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, and can \"easily be determined on the basis of the jurisdictional submissions made and to be made\";65 (3) Ecuador\u2019s objections concerning Article X of the Treaty require the application of international legal principles to the assessment of the measure at issue and the claims on their face; and (4) Ecuador\u2019s objections to Claimant\u2019s claims under the umbrella clause do not require an enquiry into the merits of the dispute.66 In Respondent\u2019s view, \"arbitral practice shows that the factual issues raised in their context can very well be decided separately from the consideration of the factual issues underlying the merits.\"67\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 5.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 332; Respondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 5.\n\n48.\n\nEcuador rejects Claimant\u2019s argument that the ICSID Tribunal rejected its jurisdictional objections that were unrelated to consent because they were merits-based;68 Ecuador clarifies that the ICSID Tribunal merely stated that it would have deferred resolution of those objections to the merits phase;69 It also claims that the ICSID Tribunal did in fact bifurcate its objections from the merits as evidenced by the separate briefing of all jurisdictional issues and the holding of a jurisdictional hearing relating to all jurisdictional issues prior to the conclusion of the briefing on the merits.70\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, pp. 4-5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 5.\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 5.\n\n49.\n\nEcuador submits that the question of bifurcation is not covered by any doctrine of *res judicata.71*\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 5.\n\n50.\n\nIn addition, Ecuador submits that bifurcation will permit the best resolution of the jurisdictional question because both Parties will be able to focus on the relevant jurisdictional issues.72\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 334.\n\n51.\n\nFinally, Ecuador rejects Claimant\u2019s allegation that Ecuador\u2019s request for bifurcation constitutes a further delay tactic on Ecuador\u2019s part in this dispute.73 It argues that it is a result of Claimant\u2019s own conduct that Claimant has been waiting for more than five years to have the merits of its case heard.74\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 6.\n\nRespondent's letter of 10 December 2012, p. 6.\n\n**The Claimant\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------\n\n52.\n\nClaimant opposes Ecuador\u2019s application for bifurcation and what it characterises as Ecuador\u2019s request for a suspension of the merits until its Objections to Jurisdiction are decided.75 Claimant notes that these claims went through a full jurisdictional phase before the ICSID Tribunal, which considered virtually all of the objections that Ecuador seeks to re-litigate here. A majority of that tribunal sustained one of Ecuador\u2019s objections and unanimously rejected the other jurisdictional objections, either outright, or because they were merits-based.76 Murphy claims that it has now cured the lone jurisdictional defect as determined by the ICSID Tribunal and that this case is ready to go to the merits.77\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, p. 1.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, p. 2.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, p. 2.\n\n53.\n\nMurphy contends that the issue as to whether Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections (that are unrelated to consent) are linked to the merits has already been decided by the ICSID Tribunal. That issue is now *res judicata.*78 The ICSID Tribunal concluded that Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections (unrelated to consent) were so intertwined with the merits that it would not be possible to determine them without a full briefing on the merits.79 Claimant argues that this holding is substantively correct and has implications on the present proceeding; Ecuador cannot re-argue issues that have been decided, just because they were decided by a different tribunal.80 Claimant denies Respondent\u2019s assertions that arbitral practice shows that factually-intensive issues can be decided at the jurisdictional phase, and distinguishes *Burlington v. Ecuador* from the present case.81\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, p. 2; Claimant\u2019s letter of 12 December 2012, p. 4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, pp. 2-3.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 12 December 2012, p. 4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 12 December 2012, p. 5.\n\n54.\n\nClaimant contests Respondent\u2019s assertion that Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976 establishes a presumption in favour of bifurcation.82 In support, Claimant refers to the practice of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal (i.e., that unless it strongly appears that the tribunal lacks jurisdiction, it will join jurisdictional objections to the merits) and ICSID figures (i.e., more than two-thirds of cases are not bifurcated) to argue that there is no \"investment arbitration practice\" in favour of bifurcation; rather, each tribunal must assess a bifurcation request by considering the applicable rules and the particular circumstances of the case. Claimant argues that all Article 21(4) does is give a tribunal the discretionary power to bifurcate.83\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, p. 2; Claimant\u2019s letter of 12 December 2012, pp. 3-4.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, pp. 2-3.\n\n55.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, Claimant points out that this case has already been fully briefed once on the merits. The final hearing is scheduled for October 2013, so there is no efficiency to be gained from suspending the merits between now and then to rehash arguments against jurisdiction that (1) have previously been addressed; (2) arise out of settled areas of law; or (3) rightly belong to the merits. Suspending the merits now would only lead to further delay in what has already been a protracted dispute. At a minimum, Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections could be briefed and heard in parallel with the merits.84\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, p. 3.\n\n56.\n\nAccording to Claimant, in order to decide to bifurcate, the Tribunal must be convinced that Ecuador's objections to jurisdiction are likely to fully dispose of the case. However, they raise complex issues of international law, and as such, it cannot be clear at this stage that any one of Ecuador's objections would be dispositive. Therefore, Claimant argues, it is more likely that bifurcation would result in unnecessary delays and cost than enhance efficiency.85\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 12 December 2012, p. 5.\n\n57.\n\nClaimant also requests that this Tribunal bear in mind that throughout this dispute, Ecuador has acted in a way that appears designed to obstruct the resolution of Murphy\u2019s claim.86 As such, Claimant beseeches the Tribunal to be cautious of Ecuador\u2019s motives to bifurcate and wary to bifurcate without good cause.87\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, p. 4; Claimant\u2019s letter of 12 December 2012, p. 5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, p. 4.\n\n**VIII. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n-----------------------------\n\n58.\n\nRespondent requests the Tribunal to \"resolve Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction in a separate, preliminary phase of the proceedings.\"88\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 336.\n\n59.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal \"rule that the jurisdictional issues raised by Ecuador be carried with the merits. Alternatively, at most the Tribunal should allow any further briefing and oral argument on jurisdiction without suspending the deadlines for the remaining merits pleadings and merits hearing set for October 2013,\"89\n\nClaimant\u2019s letter of 16 November 2012, p. 6; see also p. 2.\n\n**IX. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**Introductory remarks**\n------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 have agreed that I determine Respondent\u2019s request for bifurcation on my own. I consider that pursuant to the Parties\u2019 agreement and Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976, I have full discretion to make this decision. The exercise of my discretion will be informed by two principal considerations: (1) whether Respondent\u2019s objections are so intertwined with the merits that it would be more appropriate to decide them at that later stage; and (2) whether determining any of Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections in a preliminary phase would enhance the overall efficiency of these proceedings. I do not consider it necessary to make a pronouncement on whether Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules establishes a presumption in favour of bifurcation.\n\n61.\n\nI do note that the point has been made that the Parties have already fully pleaded this dispute on jurisdiction and merits in the ICSID Arbitration (with the exception of Ecuador\u2019s Article IV jurisdictional objections) and therefore that bifurcation will make little difference in terms of efficiency. However, I am wary of discounting the time and cost that the Parties will devote to these proceedings because of that fact; this is a new and separate proceeding to the ICSID Arbitration. It has been commenced at a later date, under a distinct procedural regime, and before a different Tribunal. It will thus present new procedural and substantive issues that will need to be pleaded by the Parties, as we are currently witnessing with the present application.\n\n62.\n\nI will now address each of Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections in turn.\n\n**Ecuador\u2019s objections concerning the interpretation of Article VI of the Treaty**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nThe first of Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections concerns the interpretation of the dispute resolution clause contained at Article VI of the Treaty.\n\n64.\n\nI consider that this objection is a purely jurisdictional one, entirely separate from the merits of Claimant\u2019s claims. For this reason, I believe that it is the type of jurisdictional objection that lends itself well to determination in a discrete phase. The next question is whether the proceedings would be rendered more efficient if this objection were determined on a preliminary basis.\n\n65.\n\nIn terms of efficiency, two considerations bear noting. The first is that Ecuador\u2019s present objection, if upheld, in principle, could dispose of this entire dispute. It goes to Ecuador\u2019s overall consent to these proceedings. Determining it early could thus have a major impact on the time and expense devoted by the Parties to this case. The second consideration is that, if Ecuador\u2019s present objection were dismissed at a preliminary stage, there would be one less issue to address during the remainder of the case. This would have obvious benefits in terms of, among other things, allocating use of hearing time.\n\n66.\n\nFor these reasons, I consider that deciding Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objection concerning the interpretation of Article VI of the Treaty in a preliminary phase is appropriate and would have a positive impact on the efficiency of these proceedings.\n\n**Ecuador\u2019s objections concerning Murphy\u2019s shareholder claims**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nEcuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections concerning Murphy\u2019s shareholder claims involve issues that are intertwined with the merits of the case. They appear to me to include factual and legal issues concerning, *inter alia,* Claimant\u2019s interests in Murphy Ecuador and the Participation Contract, the definition of protected investment under the Treaty, and an assessment of the scope and nature of Murphy Ecuador\u2019s undertakings under the settlement agreement. I do not accept Ecuador\u2019s submission that determining this objection requires no more than the application of recognised legal principles to the claims as they appear on the face of the Notice of Arbitration and Statement of Claim, and that they can \"easily be determined on the basis of the jurisdictional submissions made and to be made\". Given the significant overlap between the factual and legal issues raised as between Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections here and the merits of Claimant\u2019s claim, it would be prudent to defer this objection for determination with the merits.\n\n**Ecuador\u2019s objections concerning Article X of the Treaty**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nMy finding is the same with respect to Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections concerning Article X of the Treaty. They involve issues that are so intertwined with the merits of the case\u2014including whether Law 42 is a matter of taxation and whether Ecuador is estopped from so alleging\u2014that it is prudent to defer their determination to the merits phase. I do not accept Respondent\u2019s contention that factual issues raised in the context of such a jurisdictional objection can \"very well be decided separately from the consideration of the factual issues underlying the merits.\"90\n\nRespondent\u2019s letter of 10 December 2012, p. 5.\n\n**Ecuador\u2019s objections concerning the umbrella clause**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nI also direct that Ecuador\u2019s objections concerning the umbrella clause be deferred to the merits phase of this case. I find them to be so intertwined with the substantive issues that they are not suitable for determination in a preliminary phase. Without being exhaustive, they concern questions of privity of contract and nationality, the nature of the signatory parties\u2019 obligations under the Participation Contract, Claimant\u2019s alleged losses, and the nature and scope of the substantive obligations embodied in the Treaty\u2019s umbrella clause. The Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections are so closely related to factual and legal issues of substance that it is only feasible that they be heard together in the merits phase.\n\n70.\n\nThe ICSID Tribunal stated that Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections concerning Murphy\u2019s shareholder claims, Article X of the Treaty, and the umbrella clause \"could not have been known at [that] stage because by their nature they would have been resolved together with the merits of the case.\"91 I do not consider it necessary to determine whether the comments of that tribunal have any *res judicata* effect on the question of whether Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections should be decided with the merits in this proceeding. To the extent that the ICSID Tribunal considered that they should, I agree. Apart from Ecuador\u2019s \"successive forks-in-the-road\" jurisdictional objection, all of their present objections are so intertwined with the merits of the case that they are not suitable for determination in a preliminary phase.\n\nICSID Award on Jurisdiction, para. 158.\n\n**Remaining procedural matters**\n--------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nWith respect to the remaining deadlines for written submissions in the jurisdictional phase (i.e., 14 January 2013 for Respondent\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction and 14 February 2013 for Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction), those dates are adjusted to 20 January and 20 February 2013, respectively. Paragraph 1.2.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 is hereby adjusted.\n\n72.\n\nThe previously scheduled hearing dates in the case of bifurcation (18 and 19 March 2013) are no longer suitable. It will be necessary to find other hearing dates. Alternatively, and in light of the exceptional circumstances surrounding Professor Abi-Saab, I invite the Parties to discuss the possibility of the Tribunal deciding this objection on the papers alone.\n\n73.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and merits was scheduled for 14 to 18 October 2013 to cater for the event of no bifurcation.92 The Parties are directed to maintain these dates subject to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on Ecuador\u2019s Article VI jurisdictional objections. In the event that the Tribunal rejects Ecuador\u2019s bifurcated jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal will consult with the Parties to establish the remaining procedural timetable with a view to keeping the current October 2013 hearing dates.\n\nProcedural Order No. l,para. 1.2.2(m).\n\n**X. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n74.\n\nI hereby direct that:\n\n(i) Ecuador\u2019s jurisdictional objections based on an interpretation of Article VI of the Treaty as containing successive \"forks-in-the-road\" shall be determined in preliminary phase;\n\n(ii) All of Ecuador\u2019s remaining jurisdictional objections shall be determined with the merits."}, {"Title": "Partial Award on Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2013-11-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Separate Opinion of Georges Abi-Saab (Partial Award on Jurisdiction)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2013-11-13T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Separate Opinion of Georges Abi-Saab (Partial Award on Jurisdiction)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nWhile I concur with my co-arbitrators in the *dispositif* of the decision to dismiss the Respondent's jurisdictional objections, based on Article VI of the Treaty, I do not share most of the grounds (*motifs*) they put forward to reach this conclusion; hence this separate opinion.\n\n2.\n\nMore concretely, I do not share their analysis of \"Treaty Interpretation\" (paras. 168200); however, I do partake in their reasoning pertaining to the \"Validity of Claimant's Consent to Murphy I\" (paras. 201-204), for the following reasons.\n\n**I - The Interpretation of Article VI of the BIT**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nParagraph 2 of Article VI of the BIT provides:\n\n\"In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, *under one of the following alternatives*, for resolution:\n\na) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\nb) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedures; or\n\nc) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\" (emphasis added).\n\n4.\n\nParagraph 3 of Article VI of the BIT provides:\n\n\"a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID convention\"), provided that the Party is a party to such Convention; or\n\n(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or\n\n(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or\n\n(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.\n\nb) Once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent\".\n\n5.\n\nParagraph 3 of Article VI cannot be read in isolation from paragraph 2 of Article VI because together they constitute a logical continuum. Paragraph 3 is an elaboration of paragraph 2(c). Hence, paragraph 3 must be interpreted in accordance with the framework laid down in paragraph 2 that continues to apply to it - as detailing species of a genus.\n\n6.\n\nBoth paragraphs use the word \"or\" in listing the jurisdictional means of settling disputes that arise under the Treaty. The word \"or\" almost always carries a disjunctive meaning that signifies that the enumeration is between two or more mutually exclusive alternatives. The only exception is when it is used to signify equivalence:\n\n\"connecting two words denoting the same thing, or introducing an explanation of a preceding word, etc.; otherwise called, that is.\"\n\n(*Shorter Oxford English Dictionary*, 6th ed. 2007, vol.2, p. 2016).\n\nThe example the dictionary gives: \"An inhabitant...of the Netherlands or Holland\"\n\n7.\n\nThe meaning of the word \"or\" never has a cumulative effect that is equivalent to the word \"and\".\n\n8.\n\nWithout having to call on such abstruse jargon as \"fork in the road\", the use of \"or\" in paragraph 2 of Article VI is sufficient to indicate that the choice is limited to one of the alternatives enumerated therein. The added phrase (in italics) in the sentence: \"the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, *under one of the following alternatives*, for resolution\", is not necessary. However, it is not devoid of \"effet utile\" because it acts as a precautionary clarification, *ex abundanti cautela*, for the avoidance of doubt.\n\n9.\n\nConsidering, as mentioned above, that paragraph 3 is an elaboration of paragraph 2 and remains within its framework, the repetition of the precautionary phrase highlighted above, in paragraph 3, would have been redundant. It would have had no \"effet utile\" at all, as the clarification has already been done in paragraph 2 of which paragraph 3 is a mere elaboration.\n\n10.\n\nThe counter-argument that the two paragraphs are not logically connected - i.e. that the first paragraph deals with contract claims and the second deals with treaty claims - also does not stand. For this argument to be logically valid, paragraph 2 should not have included sub-paragraph (c), which establishes the link between the two and their legal and logical character as a continuum. It does not stand to reason that in such a continuum the provisions start by narrowing the choice for dispute resolution but end up extending it like a fish tail (effet queue de poisson).\n\n11.\n\nConcerning the rules of interpretation, treaties should not be interpreted either restrictively or extensively. Interpretation should clarify the legal import and effect of the provisions, according to the ordinary meaning of the words in their context, without adding or subtracting from the text.\n\n12.\n\nTo argue that as long as the text of paragraph 3 does not expressly prohibit choosing more than one alternative, the rule is that what is not prohibited is permitted, runs squarely against the natural meaning of the text. It totally ignores the word \"or\" and its disjunctive meaning which linguistically and logically mandates such a prohibition (*i.e.* that the choice of one alternative excludes all the others). Such an interpretation deprives the word \"or\" of any \"ellet utile\". In fact, it rewrites the text by replacing \"or\" with its antonym \"and\".\n\n13.\n\nThe same objection applies to interpreting paragraph 3 as prohibiting the choice of more than one alternative \"simultaneously\" but not prohibiting the choice of more than one alternative \"successively\", or still, that the private party can choose different alternatives successively \"until he gets a decision on the merits\". These varied formulations in the guise of interpretation introduce into the text qualifications that it does not contain. They, in fact, re-write it by adding to it.\n\n14.\n\nAll these liberties with the text are beyond the judge's or arbitrator's discretion; unless of course he is deciding *ex aequo et bono*, which can only be done with the agreement of the parties.\n\n15.\n\nFinally, the same objection also applies to the argument of teleological interpretation. According to this argument, the object and purpose of the treaty, which is the protection of foreign investment, mandates providing the foreign investor with an independent forum to decide on the merits of any disputes that may arise between him and the host State.\n\n16.\n\nIn the first place, the object and purpose of a BIT is not only to protect the interests of the foreign investor, but also those of the host State, particularly the respect of its sovereignty, including the conditions and limits it sets lor its consent to international arbitration.\n\n17.\n\nSecondly, to argue that the treaty has to provide in all cases an independent forum to decide on the merits of any dispute that may arise, overlooks or ignores all the conditions and limitations that the treaty lays down lor recourse to arbitration. It thus amounts to rewriting the treaty by introducing into it an obligation of result (*obligation de r\u00e9sultat*) which it does not contain, of delivering in all cases a forum that decides on the merits. It transforms the treaty into an insurance policy through an argument of necessity (which we know does not create law) - that without such a guarantee or obligation of result, there will be no forum to decide; which is allegedly an absurd result. But to consider this an absurd result is itself absurd; for, in international law, unlike in municipal law, the default position is the absence of an ultimate competent forum, because of the fundamental principle of the consensual basis of jurisdiction. This is particularly so, when, as *in casu*, the party was afforded a possibility in the treaty, but forfeited it by its own fault (by committing a deliberate violation of the treaty in order to precipitate the process).\n\n18.\n\nFor the above reasons, I do not share the reasoning of my co-arbitrators on Treaty Interpretation, as I consider that Article VI paragraph 3 does not afford the investor more than one choice of arbitral forum.\n\n**II - The Validity of the Claimant's Consent to Murphy I**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nIn  Murphy I, the ICSID Tribunal did not pronounce on the validity of Murphy's choice to consent to ICSID arbitration. It merely found that it lacked jurisdiction owing to the non-fulfillment of the condition precedent for the consent of the private party to go to arbitration via one of the three prescribed procedures, of a lapse of six months from the time the dispute arose.\n\n20.\n\nThe condition of prior negotiations or prior period for negotiations as well as that of exhaustion of local remedies are conditions of admissibility in general international law. However, when they are stipulated as conditions in the jurisdictional title, they become limits to jurisdiction as well, and can serve as legal bases for objections to jurisdiction.\n\n21.\n\nIn BITs, these conditions are usually stipulated as conditions for the consent of the State to go to arbitration. However, *in casu*, the text of the chapeau of paragraph 3(a) of Article VI is clear in providing a different solution. It reads:\n\n\"a) *Provided that...six months have elapsed* from the date on which the dispute arose, *the national or company* concerned *may choose to consent...* to the submission of the dispute to settlement by binding arbitration\" (emphasis added) via one of the three enumerated procedures.\n\n22.\n\nIn other words, what is subjected to the condition is *the consent to go to arbitration by choosing one of the three alternatives* ; *i.e.* the condition qualifies the private party's consent to one of the three modes of arbitration.\n\n23.\n\nThis interpretation is based on the clear meaning of the text and is supported by its context, particularly sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 3, which provides:\n\n\" *Once the national or company concerned has*  ***so***  *consented,* either party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the consent\". (emphasis added)\n\n24.\n\nThis provision envisages the separation of two legal acts: (a) the consent to go to arbitration by choosing an arbitral forum; and (b) the initiation of the arbitration before the chosen forum. This separation can be in relation to the timing of the consent and the initiation of the arbitration, as well as the subject that can perform the act (consent by the private party; initiation by either party).\n\n25.\n\nIt is significant that, in this provision, the condition of the lapse of six months is not attached to the act of initiation of arbitration, but to the consent, as implied from the language \"once the national...has *so* consented\". The word \"so\" obviously refers to the consent as qualified by the two conditions stipulated under paragraph 3(a).\n\n26.\n\nAs already mentioned, the ICSID Tribunal did not declare that Murphy's choice to consent to ICSID's arbitration was invalid. However, the import of its decision is that this choice of consenting to ICSID arbitration, as a legal act (*acte juridique*), was ineffective because it failed to produce the legal effect it purported to achieve. In other words, it was a defective legal act.\n\n27.\n\nThat this defect is attributable to the willful violation or non-observance of the condition by the Claimant, does not cure the legal act of its defect. However, it may provide another objection to the resubmission of the dispute to another forum, namely the principle that \u2018\u2018no one can benefit from his own turpitude\" *(Nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans).* But this last point, though raised by the Respondent, was hardly pleaded by the parties.\n\n28.\n\nFor the reasons given above on the issue of the validity of the Claimant\u2019s consent to Murphy I, I concur with the conclusion of my co-arbitrators that the Respondent\u2019s objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal based on Article VI of the Treaty should be dismissed."}], "Content": "Partial Award on Jurisdiction\n-----------------------------\n\n**I.

RELEVANT LEGAL PROVISIONS**\n---------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nClaimant commenced these proceedings against Ecuador by Notice of Arbitration dated 21 September 2011 pursuant to Article VI of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (the \"**US-Ecuador BIT**\", \"**BIT**\", or \"**Treaty**\").\n\n4.\n\nArticle VI of the BIT provides:\n\n1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedures; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\"), provided that the Party is a party to such Convention; or\n\n(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or\n\n(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or\n\n(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(b) once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.\n\n4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:\n\n(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for Purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and\n\n(b) an \"agreement in writing\" for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958 (\"New York Convention\").\n\n5. Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article shall be held in a state that is a party to the New York Convention.\n\n**III. BACKGROUND**\n-------------------\n\n**Factual background of the dispute**\n-------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThis section contextualises the decision of the Tribunal on the Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on Article VI of the BIT, but does not represent findings of fact.\n\n6.\n\nFollowing a bidding process in 1985, Ecuador and a consortium of oil companies led by Conoco Ecuador Limited (\"**Conoco**\") entered into a Service Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 16 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region (\"**Service Contract**\").1 The consortium consisted of Conoco, Overseas Petroleum and Investment Corporation, Diamond Shamrock South America Petroleum B.V., and Nomeco Latin American Inc. (\"**Consortium**\").2 The Service Contract assigned Respondent ownership of the oil produced and the Consortium a set fee for the oil extraction.3\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 3; Statement of Claim, para. 4 and paras. 54-57, 70-74; Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 14.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 3; Statement of Claim, para. 69; Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 13.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 3.\n\n7.\n\nClaimant's subsidiaries acquired a 20% aggregate interest in the Service Contract in 1987. Conoco assigned 10% of its rights and obligations under the Service Contract to each of Murphy Ecuador Oil Company Limited (\"**Murphy Ecuador**\"), a company from Bermuda,4 and its immediate parent company, Canam Offshore Limited (\"**Canam**\"), a company from the Bahamas5 that was wholly owned by Claimant.6\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 16.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 16.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, paras. 15-16\n\n8.\n\nIn December 1996, the Consortium and Ecuador executed the Modification of the Service Contract into a Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block 16 of the Amazon Region of Ecuador (\"**Participation Contract**\").7 The Participation Contract, which was intended to remain in force until 31 January 2012,8 allocated a percentage of oil production to the Consortium and authorised it to market its share.9 Claimant's subsidiaries had a 20% stake in this contract.10\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 5; Statement of Claim, para. 5 and paras. 58-62, 68, 78-131; Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 19-25.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 3.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 5; Statement of Claim, para. 2.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 5.\n\n9.\n\nIn the early 2000s, global oil prices rose sharply.\n\n10.\n\nOn 25 April 2006, Ecuador amended its Hydrocarbons Law and passed Law 42.11 Law 42 obliged the Consortium to pay an \"additional participation\" of at least 50% of the difference between the actual monthly average price of oil and the price as of the date of the Participation Contract.12 Decree No. 1672, a regulatory decree issued in July 2006, set the additional participation at 50%.13 This percentage was increased to 99% by Decree No. 662, which was issued in October 2007.14\n\nLaw No. 42, Official Gazette No. 257 (Supplement), Apr. 25, 2006, **CEX-47**.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 7; Statement of Claim, paras. 8-9, 132-141; Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 29-38.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 8, 30; Statement of Claim, paras. 10, 145.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 30; Statement of Claim, paras. 10, 146; Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 36.\n\n11.\n\nIn December 2007, Ecuador enacted the Tax Equity Law that applied to all new or modified contracts issued on 1 January 2008 and after.15 This law created a 70% tax on profits from oil sales that would apply only when a reference price, on which each oil company and Ecuador had to agree, was exceeded.16 Respondent contends that the high reference rates negotiated by the oil companies and the lower assessment rate provided for by the Tax Equity Law effectively tempered the effect of Decree No. 662.17\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 37.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 37.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 38.\n\n12.\n\nClaimant contends that it and the other Consortium members sought to enforce the original terms of the Participation Contract, but made Law 42 payments under protest for a time. It quantifies its share of these payments at USD118 million.18 Ecuador contends that Claimant became the sole dissenting member of the Consortium with regard to the continuance of operations in Block 16.19\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 9; Statement of Claim, paras. 179-181.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 40.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 February 2008, Claimant notified Ecuador of its intention to submit the dispute between the Parties on Law 42 to arbitration.20 It also contended that the six-month notice period required by Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT expired in or around October 2006.21\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 31; Murphy's Letter to Ecuador dated 29 February 2009, **CEX-4**.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 31.\n\n**Procedural history of the ICSID proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn March 2008, Claimant initiated ICSID proceedings under the Treaty (\"**ICSID Arbitration**\").22 Shortly thereafter, Murphy Ecuador, together with the other Consortium members, initiated a separate ICSID arbitration relating to the same facts (\"**Murphy Ecuador ICSID Arbitration**\").23\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 31.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, paras. 41, 49.\n\n15.\n\nClaimant alleged that, after May 2008, Respondent forced investors to convert their participation contracts to new service contracts or risk the termination of their contracts and the abandonment of their investments.24 On 12 March 2009, therefore, Claimant sold its interest in the Participation Contract, i.e., its entire equity interest in Murphy Ecuador, to the Consortium's operator, which was Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. by then.25 Claimant states that it did so at a substantially diminished value and exclusive of the USD118 million in Law 42 payments it had made under protest.26 Respondent contends that Claimant suffered no loss.27\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 10-11; Statement of Claim, paras. 182-201.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 202-209; First Witness Statement of Ignacio Herrera, para. 51.

In 1999, the Spanish group Repsol took on the role of Consortium operator from YPF, which is what Maxus Ecuador was then called. Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 18. In January 2001, a newly created entity named Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. (\" **Repsol** \") assumed the role of Consortium operator.

Thus...the only bar to a new tribunal's having jurisdiction over the present dispute was the majority's finding that Murphy had not consulted and negotiated with Ecuador for a six-month period before filing for arbitration.29\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of* Ecuador, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award on Jurisdiction, December 15, 2010, **CEX--3**.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 38.\n\n19.\n\nEcuador alleges that the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, agreed to withdraw its claims in the Murphy Ecuador ICSID Arbitration with prejudice in exchange for a Modification Contract to the Participation Contract that would convert the latter to a service contract.30 This settlement was reached on 23 November 2010.31\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 46.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 46.\n\n20.\n\nBy letter dated 30 December 2010, Murphy invited Ecuador to participate in consultations and negotiations regarding their dispute under the Treaty,32 to which Ecuador responded by letter dated 31 January 2011 stating, *inter alia*, that the \"six-month period [prescribed by Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT] begins to run only from January 3, 2011.\"33\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 38.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 38.\n\n21.\n\nBetween February and July 2011, the Parties exchanged correspondence and conducted a meeting, but were unable to resolve their dispute.34\n\nNotice of Arbitration, paras. 39-47; Statement of Claim, paras. 32-42.\n\n22.\n\nOn 13 July 2011, Murphy filed a second Request for Arbitration with ICSID, to which Ecuador objected on jurisdictional grounds. On 19 August 2011, Murphy withdrew the said request without prejudice.35\n\nNotice of Arbitration, para. 49; Statement of Claim, paras. 43-44.\n\n**Procedural history of the present proceedings**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nBy a Notice of Arbitration dated 21 September 2011, Claimant commenced these proceedings against Ecuador under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 March 2012, Claimant appointed Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r (of Mannheimer Swartling Advokatbyr\u00e2, Norrlandsgaten 21, Stockholm, Sweden) as arbitrator. On 12 April 2012, Ecuador appointed Professor Georges Abi-Saab (of 14 Chemin de St. Georges, Clarens, Switzerland) as arbitrator. On 25 May 2012, Professors Hob\u00e9r and Abi-Saab jointly appointed Professor Bernard Hanotiau (of Hanotiau & van den Berg, 480 Avenue Louise, B9, Brussels, Belgium) as Presiding Arbitrator.\n\n25.\n\nThe Parties and the Tribunal signed the Terms of Appointment on 3 September 2012.\n\n26.\n\nThe Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1, which formalised a partial procedural timetable in accordance with a procedural teleconference held on 19 July 2012.\n\n27.\n\nOn 17 September 2012, Claimant filed a Statement of Claim (\"**Statement of Claim**\") accompanied by (1) the first witness statement of Mr. Ignacio Herrera; (2) the expert report of Dr. Hern\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Loose with annexes; (3) the expert report of Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA with attachments; and (4) exhibits CEX-1 to CEX-167 and legal authorities CLA-001 to CLA-108. Claimant dispatched relevant Spanish translations on 15 October 2012, along with English translations of selected documents and a corrected Statement of Claim, Errata Sheet, and missing exhibits (including CEX-168).\n\n28.\n\nOn 18 October 2012, Ecuador submitted its Objections to Jurisdiction (\"**Objections to Jurisdiction**\") accompanied by exhibits REX-1 to REX-33 and legal authorities RLA-1 to RLA-194. On 23 October 2012, Ecuador submitted a revised version of its Objections to Jurisdiction (to correct minor errors) and an errata sheet. Relevant Spanish translations were submitted on 15 November 2012.\n\n29.\n\nAccompanying its Objections to Jurisdiction was a request by Respondent that the Tribunal \"bifurcate these proceedings and address in a preliminary fashion the serious jurisdictional issues hereto raised so that they can be separately assessed and resolved at the outset of this dispute.\"36\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 321.\n\n30.\n\nOn 16 November 2012, Claimant filed its Response to Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction (\"**Claimant's Response**\") accompanied by exhibits CEX-169 to CEX-192 and legal authorities CLA-109 to CLA-232, and opposed Respondent's request for bifurcation. It provided a Spanish translation of its submissions on 15 December 2012.\n\n31.\n\nOn 17 November 2012, the Tribunal proposed that the issue of bifurcation be resolved without Professor Abi-Saab, who would be unable to fulfil his arbitral obligations from the week of 19 November 2012 to March 2013 for medical reasons.\n\n32.\n\nOn 10 and 13 December 2012, respectively, Respondent and Claimant agreed that the Presiding Arbitrator alone would decide on Respondent's request for bifurcation.\n\n33.\n\nOn 19 December 2012, the Presiding Arbitrator issued his Decision on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation (\"**Bifurcation Decision**\"), in which he directed that the Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on Article VI of the Treaty be determined in a preliminary phase. Subject to the outcome of this phase, the remaining jurisdictional objections were to be joined with the merits. The Bifurcation Decision further established a timetable for the preliminary phase and scheduled a jurisdictional hearing for 21 and 22 May 2013. The Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"**PCA**\") provided the Parties with a Spanish translation of the Bifurcation Decision on 14 January 2013.\n\n34.\n\nOn 21 January 2013, Ecuador submitted a Reply to Claimant's Response (\"**Respondent's Reply**\") accompanied by the expert opinion of Professor Kenneth Vandevelde with exhibits 1-15 and the witness statement of Dra. Christel Gaibor Flor, with an English translation.\n\n35.\n\nOn 20 March 2013, Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (\"**Claimant's Rejoinder**\") with exhibits CEX-193 to CEX-198 and legal authorities CLA-233 to CLA-267, accompanied by the second witness statement of Mr. Ignacio Herrera and the expert report of Professor Steven R. Ratner with accompanying exhibits 1 to 27.\n\n36.\n\nOn 21 to 22 May 2013, a hearing on jurisdiction was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the Netherlands.\n\n37.\n\nOn 11 July 2013, the Parties submitted their respective Statements of Costs.\n\n38.\n\nBy e-mail of 20 September 2013, Claimant submitted to the Tribunal the award in *Dede v. Romania* issued on 5 September 2013, accompanied by brief arguments in support of its case on jurisdiction. By e-mail dated September 27, 2013, Respondent submitted comments in response.37\n\n*Dede v. Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/22, Award, September 5, 2013 (\"*Dede* Award\").\n\n**IV.

Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n42.\n\nRespondent contends that the choices of arbitral fora listed in Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT are exclusive and irrevocable.39 It argues that the \"or\" in this provision delineates alternatives,40 and explains that \"or\" denotes equivalence only when it connects synonyms or substitutes,41 which the arbitral fora enumerated in Article VI(3)(a) are not.42 The inclusion of \"choose\" in the provision confirms this interpretation.43\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 31.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 60.\n\nRespondent's Reply, paras. 58-60, *citing* P.

VI(2)) *reprinted in* U.S. International Investment Agreements 810 (K. Vandevelde, 2009), p. 813, **RLA-205**. To illustrate that Article VI(2) of the 1992 US Model BIT indisputably operated as a fork-in-the-road, Respondent refers to the verbatim incorporation of this provision in seven BITs whose respective Letters of Submittal from the U.S. Department of State to the Committee of Foreign Relations of the U.S. Senate all describe this provision as allowing the investor to make \"an exclusive and irrevocable choice\" of the options so listed.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n55.\n\nClaimant argues that Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT enumerates available and equivalent arbitral fora but does not operate as a fork-in-the-road.82\n\nClaimant's Response, paras. 48-49; Hearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 107:17-20.\n\n56.\n\nClaimant contends that the analysis for ascertaining the ordinary meaning of Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT should not extend to the other treaties discussed by Respondent and should be constrained to that BIT alone.83 For example, Claimant highlights that the 1992 US Model BIT\u2014upon which the US-Ecuador BIT was based\u2014 is only a model treaty and not an actual one, and, further, reflects the intention of the United States alone.84\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 104:5-10.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 211:11-13.\n\n57.\n\nClaimant attributes the fork-in-the-road effect of Article VI(2) of the US-Ecuador BIT to the phrase \"under one of the following alternatives.\"85 It points out that this phrase was not present in the 1992 US Model BIT and was specifically inserted in Article VI(2) but not Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT.86 This phrase not only signifies the mutual exclusivity of the choices listed in the provision but also requires the selection of a single option among them.87 That Article VI(3)(a) contains neither this phrase nor language analogous to it88 proves that the Parties did not intend Article VI(3)(a) to operate as a fork-in-the-road.89\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 43, 45; Hearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 104:15-19.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 104:20-22.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 43, 45.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 47, *referring* to analogous language found in Ecuador's other BITs; Hearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 108:9-11.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 41, *stating* that the Tribunal should first look at the words chosen by the parties in order to ascertain their intention with regard to the BIT.\n\n58.\n\nClaimant alleges that Respondent should be prevented from \"insert[ing] this language \u2018under one of the following alternatives' into Article VI(3) where it's not there.\"90 It summarises its argument on this point as follows:\n\n[t]he absence of the phrase, \u2018one of the following alternatives,' gives Article VI(3) an inclusive character, which means the choice is not exclusive and irrevocable but can result in a second choice in some circumstances like we have here; namely, a jurisdictional decision without a decision on the merits and where the State has withdrawn in the interim from the original forum.91\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 108:18 to 109:12, *discussing* *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award (6 May 2013).\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 211:1-8.\n\n59.\n\nFurther to this argument, Claimant highlights that the only textual limitation in Article VI(3)(a)\u2014which is that the investor can choose the Additional Facility of ICSID only if ICSID itself is not available, as per Article VI(3)(a)(ii)\u2014is specifically included therein.92\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 107:23 to 108:3.\n\n60.\n\nClaimant argues that the phrase \"under one of the following alternatives\" has a meaning of its own and does not merely enhance the effect of \"or\" in Article VI(2). It points out that Professor Vandevelde, Respondent's legal expert who takes a contrary position, did not negotiate the US-Ecuador BIT.93 Claimant also submits that the opinion of Professor Vandevelde disregards both his contemporaries' work and supporting documentation,94 and is discredited by his characterisation of the only phrase differentiating Articles VI(2) and VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT as \"superfluous.\"95 Claimant stresses that \"treaties cannot be interpreted and should not be interpreted if there is a way to do so, to render the provisions superfluous. They have to be given some meaning.\"96 This is especially the case because of the specific insertion of this phrase in the 1994 US Model BIT.97\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 68.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 67.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, paras. 69-70.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 105:19-21.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 105:22-24.\n\n61.\n\nClaimant contends that the four choices listed in Article VI(3)(a) would have been incorporated in the three choices found in Article VI(2) if the former was intended to operate as a fork-in-the-road.98\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 72, *citing* Professor Ratner's Opinion, para. 15.\n\n62.\n\nClaimant argues that the Letter of Submittal of the US-Ecuador BIT treats the general choice of arbitration as \"exclusive and irrevocable,\" but does not expound on Article VI(3)(a).99\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 73, *citing* Professor Ratner's Opinion, para. 34.\n\n63.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the 2004 US Model BIT does not shed light on the US-Ecuador BIT. First, the US-Ecuador BIT must be interpreted as of the time it was executed, which was more than a decade prior to 2004.100 Second, the placement of \"or\" after each arbitral forum in Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT establishes the equivalence of the enumerated fora, which is not the case for the single \"or\" located after the penultimate forum in the corresponding Article 24(3) of the 2004 US Model BIT.101 And third, Article 24(3) operates as a fork-in-the-road because the 2004 US Model BIT imposes arbitration as the sole means to resolve investment disputes, which the US-Ecuador BIT does not.102\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 74.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 75-76.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 77.\n\n64.\n\nClaimant contends that the \"or\" in Article VI(3)(a), unlike the phrase \"under one of the following alternatives\" or similar language,103 cannot establish the mutual exclusivity of the listed arbitral fora because:\n\nthe word \"or\" separating the choices of arbitral fora in Article VI(3) should be interpreted as prohibiting a foreign investor from instituting multiple arbitrations in different fora concurrently, but not as making an investor's choice irrevocable in the event its submission to any one such arbitral forum is rejected on jurisdictional grounds. Thus, as long as (i) an investor's submission to a particular arbitral forum is exclusive in time and (ii) the merits of the investment dispute have not been decided by any forum, an investor is permitted to re-file its claims before any of the arbitral tribunals listed in Article VI(3)\u2014particularly when, as here, the original forum is no longer available due to the exclusive conduct of one of the Parties in withdrawing from that forum before the jurisdictional defect could be cured.104\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 48.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 44 n. 38.\n\n65.\n\nAt the hearing, Claimant agreed that \"\u2018or' could be read consistent with the *effet utile* to mean that the choice is exclusive insofar as it results in a decision on the merits.\"105\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 175:18-21.\n\n66.\n\nClaimant rejects Respondent's argument that the fork-in-the-road effect of Article VI(2) of the US-Ecuador BIT operates without regard to whether a claimant can achieve a decision on the merits, explaining that the fact that \"you have... access to the domestic court system suggests that you will get a decision on the merits.\"106 Claimant also stresses that the purpose of the fork is to lead to a decision on the merits.107\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 178:12-14.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 179:18-21.\n\n67.\n\nClaimant argues that Article VI(3)(a) uses \"or\" in its inclusive sense, in order to signify an enumeration or equivalence.108 This would not cause Article VI(3) to establish \"multiple agreements in writing\" in violation of Article II of the New York Convention.109 Article II of the New York Convention ascertains the existence of the arbitration agreement.110 Claimant maintains that because Articles VI(2) and VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT are not agreements to arbitrate but rather offers from the host States to do so,111 only one arbitration agreement is created each time an investor consents to arbitration under Article VI(3)(a).112\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 44, *citing* Merriam-Webster Dictionary of the English Language Unabridged 1585 (1993), **CEX-169** and American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1271, **CEX-170**.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 61.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 62.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 63; R.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n84.\n\nClaimant states that one of the objects of the US-Ecuador BIT is to protect investments and grant investors access to arbitration.156 The Preamble of the BIT obliges Respondent to provide \"fair and equitable treatment of [Murphy's] investment\" and to \"maintain a stable framework for investment.\"157 Similarly, the Letter of Submittal of the US-Ecuador BIT states that the latter authorises investors to bypass domestic courts and resort to binding international arbitration.158\n\nClaimant's Response, paras. 57-58, *citing* BIT Letter of Transmittal, **REX-15** (where the Message from the President of the United States stated that \"under this Treaty, the Parties also agree to international law standards for... the investors' freedom to choose to resolve disputes with the host government through international arbitration\" and that \"the Treaty's approach to dispute settlement will serve as model [sic] for negotiation with other Andean Pact countries\").\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 89, *referring* to US-Ecuador BIT Preamble, para. 4, **CEX-1**.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 87, *citing* Respondent's Reply, para. 84 and Claimant's Response, paras. 56-58. Hearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 112:1-7.\n\n85.\n\nClaimant notes that Article 32(b) of the Vienna Convention prohibits a treaty interpretation that would lead to a \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable\" result.159\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 60, *citing* Vienna Convention, Art. 32(b) and para. 61, *citing* *BG Group plc v. Argentina,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, December 24, 2007, para. 147, **CLA-25.** Claimant refers to *BG v. Argentina*, where the tribunal relied on this provision to strike an exhaustion-of-local-remedies clause from the BIT because Argentina conditioned the access of investors to domestic courts on the renunciation of their right to international arbitration. *Id.*, at para. 61.\n\n86.\n\nClaimant contends that Respondent's interpretation of Article VI(3)(a) violates Article 32(b) of the Vienna Convention160 because, under the unique circumstances of this case, it would prevent any tribunal from reaching the merits of Claimant's claim.161 While Respondent has identified an ICSID arbitration as Claimant's only option, Respondent's denunciation of the ICSID Convention has made it impossible for Claimant to resubmit its claim to this forum.162 Respondent's interpretation therefore extinguishes Claimant's right to arbitration.163\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 62.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 60; Claimant's Rejoinder, para. 96.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 60; Hearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 113:17-22.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 91.\n\n87.\n\nClaimant's position, in other words, is that \"to interpret a treaty so as to permit a new choice to consent is particularly warranted in a situation where the legal posture of the Respondent has changed significantly due to its withdrawal from the ICSID Convention.\"164 Claimant stresses that \"it would be manifestly absurd and unreasonable to deny Murphy an alternative [to international arbitration] in light of Ecuador's withdrawal from ICSID.\"165\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 113:12-17.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 212:12-14.\n\n88.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent's interpretation also violates the principle of *effet utile* because it renders Article VI meaningless166 and does not facilitate the access of investors to the listed dispute resolution procedures.167 Claimant contends that the \"absolute right to binding arbitration of investment disputes, which implies the dispute ought to be settled, resolved in some way\" is made relevant because of the *effet utile* principle.168 Apart from requiring the Tribunal to give effect to the phrase \"under one of the following alternatives\" that is present in Article VI(2) but not Article VI(3)(a), the *effet utile* principle also \"requires the Tribunal, under the circumstances of this case where Ecuador has withdrawn from ICSID, to interpret the dispute-resolution clause to give Murphy an opportunity to have its dispute adjudicated on the merits rather than to foreclose this opportunity.\"169\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 96.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 93-95, *citing* Professor Ratner's Opinion, para. 9 and *Asian Agricultural Products LTD (AAPL) v.

Argentina*, which involved a dispute resolution clause that positioned ICSID arbitration and UNCITRAL arbitration, as mutually exclusive and irrevocable alternatives through the use of \"either.or.\"174 Notwithstanding this restrictive language, however, the *Daimler v. Argentina* tribunal still referred to the possibility of having a \"future arbitration proceeding.\"175\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, paras. 98-99, *citing* *Daimler Financial Services AG v.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n93.\n\nClaimant contends that the \"resubmission jurisprudence conclusively establishes that a claimant whose original claim was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction is not precluded from commencing a new claim once the original jurisdictional flaw has been corrected.\"178\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 65.\n\n94.\n\nClaimant refers to *Waste Management v. Mexico*,179 where the tribunal accepted a claim that was re-filed by the claimant after its failure to meet a jurisdictional requirement led to the dismissal of its initial claim.180 It quotes the relevant part of the holding, as follows:\n\nIn international litigation the withdrawal of a claim does not, unless otherwise agreed, amount to a waiver of any underlying rights of the withdrawing party. Neither does a claim which fails for want of jurisdiction prejudice underlying rights: if the jurisdictional flaw can be corrected there is in principle no objection to the claimant State recommencing its action.181\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 66, *citing* Waste Management, Inc. v.

Claimant also points out that the tribunal in *Waste Management II* relied on the *Barcelona Traction* case for its conclusion. Claimant's Response, para. 68\n\n95.\n\nClaimant contends that this holding is instructive for this case, given the silence or permissiveness of Article VI(3) of the US-Ecuador BIT on the issue of resubmission.182\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 110.\n\n96.\n\nClaimant refers to *Daimler v. Argentina,* where the tribunal dismissed the claim filed by Daimler based on its failure to meet a jurisdictional requirement, but then clarified that the claimant could \"upon satisfaction of the Treaty's conditions precedent to arbitration... assert any retrospective MFN claims it may have in any future arbitration proceeding...\"183\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 69, *citing* *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/01, Award, August 22, 2012, para. 281, **RLA-145**.\n\n97.\n\nClaimant refers to the decision in *Tradex Hellas v. Albania*, where the tribunal found that Albania had consented to ICSID jurisdiction partly because \"to deny ICSID jurisdiction would force the investor to initiate arbitration under the UNCITRAL rules. and Albania had not indicated whether it would contest jurisdiction of arbitration under the UNCITRAL rules.\"184 While *Tradex* did not involve a BIT claim, Claimant asserts its relevance to the case at hand185 and argues that the Tribunal should allow Claimant to resort to UNCITRAL arbitration given the current unavailability of ICSID arbitration.186\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 112, *citing Tradex Hellas S.A. v.

Algeria*, where the tribunal dismissed the claim brought by the *de facto* consortium of claimants\u2014on the ground that this consortium was not an authorised investor\u2014but stated that the claimants could file individual claims to meet the jurisdictional requirement.187\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 70, *citing Consorzio Groupement L.E.S.I.\u2014DIPENTA v.

Lauder v. Czech Republic*, *Wena Hotels*, and *SGS v. Pakistan* to illustrate that the non-observation of cooling-off periods does not lead to the dismissal of claims, as these periods are procedural in nature.190 Moreover, forcing claimants to re-file their claims when these periods have expired in the meantime would be uneconomical.191\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 71, *citing* *Ethyl Corporation v. the Government of Canada*, NAFTA UNCITRAL Case, Award on Jurisdiction, June 24, 1998 (\"*Ethyl Corp.* Award\"), paras. 77-84, **CLA-217** ; *Ronald S.

Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n102.\n\nRespondent contends that the cases Claimant cites do not \"establish that a claimant whose original claim was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under one chosen forum may commence a new arbitration before a different arbitral forum absent the consent of the respondent.\"195 At most, Respondent argues, they \"stand for the proposition that an investor who has consented to an arbitral procedure might be able to resubmit its claims for arbitration, in the case of a curable jurisdictional defect, to the same arbitral forum, provided, of course, that the conditions for accessing that procedure are met.\"196\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 101.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 49:23 to 50:3.\n\n103.\n\nRespondent states that *Waste Management II* was based on language specific to the North American Free Trade Agreement.197 Moreover, the tribunal in that case stated the default position under international law, which the Parties' specific agreement supersedes.198 And lastly, *Waste Management II* involved the re-filing of a claim in the original forum,199 whereas Claimant seeks to re-file its claim in a forum different from its original choice.200\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 97-98, *citing Waste Management II* Decision on Preliminary Objection, para. 35, **CLA-190**.

Algeria* and the present case.202 It further stresses that the tribunals in these two cases gave the respective claimants leave to resubmit their claims upon correction of the jurisdictional flaws, which the Murphy I tribunal did not do.203\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 102.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 104.\n\nRespondent's Reply, para. 107, *citing* Muprhy I *,* para. 157, **CEX-3** ; Hearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 50:1014.\n\n105.\n\nRespondent distinguishes *Tradex* from the facts of the case at hand, primarily on the basis that the claimant in *Tradex* was not guaranteed an international forum even if it complied with all preconditions; by contrast, Claimant was guaranteed an international forum if it complied with all requirements.204\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 50:18 to 51:3.\n\n106.\n\nRespondent argues that even if the tribunal's statement in *Dede v. Romania* that its \"decision is without prejudice to Claimant's right to file its claims once the jurisdictional preconditions [\u2026] have been satisfied\" could be considered a determination\u2014which Respondent claims it is not\u2014this does not support Claimant's position that it may chose a *different* forum from the one it originally chose.205\n\nRespondent's e-mail dated 27 September 2013.\n\n107.\n\nRespondent distinguishes this case from both *E.T.I. Euro Telecom International N.V. v. Bolivia*, where the parties agreed for the ICSID claim to be withdrawn and resubmitted to UNCITRAL arbitration,206 and *Nova Scotia Power Incorporated v.

Czech Republic*, where the tribunal characterised the purpose of Article VI(3) of the US-Czech Republic Treaty\u2014which is similar to Article VI(3) of the US-Ecuador Treaty209\u2014as preventing a claimant from bringing an investment dispute against the same respondent \"before different arbitral tribunals.\"210\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 71 n. 62, *citing Lauder* Award *.*\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 71, *citing* *Lauder* Award, para. 161.\n\n110.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimant's original selection of ICSID arbitration reinforces Respondent's characterisation of Article VI(3)(a). The ICSID Convention prohibits a party from unilaterally withdrawing its consent when both parties have given their consent211 and provides that the consent to ICSID arbitration shall be deemed to exclude any other remedy.212 Respondent also quotes Professor Schreuer's Commentary, as follows: \"once consent to ICSID arbitration has been given, the parties have lost their right to seek relief in another forum, national *and* international, and are restricted to pursuing their claim through ICSID.\"213 It further refers to *Lanco v.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n111.\n\nClaimant makes the following alternative argument:\n\nMurphy accepts in the alternative that per the ICSID Tribunal Award of the Murphy First Award and Ecuador[\u2018s] position throughout the first and second ICSID proceedings, Murphy's consent to ICSID arbitration was ineffective; and therefore, Murphy has stated and restates that [it] first gave effective consent to international arbitration in its 2011 UNCITRAL Request for Arbitration.215\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 114:22 to 115:3; Claimant's e-mail dated 20 September 2013.\n\n112.\n\nClaimant argues that the finding of the Murphy I tribunal confirms the invalidity of Murphy's consent to ICSID arbitration under the BIT.216 Claimant's legal expert, Professor Ratner, thus submits that \"[t]he denial of jurisdiction by one arbitral venue allows the investor to make a claim in another arbitral venue to whose jurisdiction the State has already consented.\"217 While it did resubmit its claim to ICSID arbitration (only to withdraw the said claim at a later time), Claimant clarifies that it did not consent anew to ICSID arbitration, but merely used the same consent that the Murphy I tribunal had found to be invalid.218 Claimant argues that its first valid consent to international arbitration under Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT was to this UNCITRAL arbitration.219\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 115:4-10.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 120:11-14.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 115:16-19.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 115:20-24.\n\n113.\n\nClaimant further argues that the invalidation of its consent to ICSID arbitration is rooted in the text of Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT itself,220 in that the six-month negotiation period stipulated in that provision is \"not just a precondition to Ecuador's consent... [but] is a precondition to Murphy's ability even to choose the perfect [consent] to any of the arbitral forums including ICSID.\"221\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 115:11-15.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 185:19-23.\n\n114.\n\nTurning first to Article VI(2) of the BIT, Claimant identifies three conditions that an investor must meet before submitting a dispute for resolution: (1) that \"an investment dispute\" had arisen;222 (2) that the Parties had sought \"resolution [of their investment dispute] through consultation and negotiation;\"223 and (3) that the Parties had failed to settle their dispute.224 According to Claimant, Article VI(4) of the US-Ecuador BIT provides that the consent of the State to arbitrate is subject to the compliance of the investor with the conditions set in Article VI(3).225 And finally, Article VI(3) provides that the validity of Claimant's consent is subject to the condition \"that Murphy had initiated the six months' negotiation, and those six months [had] elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose.\"226\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 191:15-16.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 191:20-22.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 191:23.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 192:23-25.

The limitation is that this election does not perfect the State's consent.\"235\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 206:6-12.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 68:16-21.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 61:19-22; Respondent's e-mail dated 27 September 2013.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 161:12-15; Respondent's e-mail dated 27 September 2013, *citing* the *Dede* Award. Respondent submits that (i) as the Turkey-Romania BIT at issue in *Dede v Romania* does not include any fork-in-the-road provision, the exclusive and irrevocable nature of a choice of arbitral forum was not at issue; (ii) the *Dede* Award was not about conditions to a claimant's consent to arbitrate but rather about conditions to a respondent State's consent to arbitrate and a claimant investor's right to submit a dispute to arbitration; and (iii) the *Dede* Award is not authority for the proposition that an investor's choice to consent to one or the other forum under Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT would be rendered invalid for failure to fulfill a condition precedent to the submission of a claim to arbitration.\n\n118.\n\nIn this case, while Claimant's non-compliance with this requirement prevented it from triggering the consent of Respondent to ICSID arbitration,236 Claimant consented to ICSID arbitration and thereby made an irrevocable choice of arbitral forum.237 That Claimant recognised the validity and irrevocability of its consent to ICSID arbitration can be discerned from its withdrawal, without prejudice, of its second ICSID claim238 and by its efforts to seek the agreement of Ecuador on a different arbitral forum.239\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 66:6-9.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 161:20-25.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 68:19-21\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 62:8-13.\n\n119.\n\nRespondent further argues that the international law principle of *ex injuria non oritur jus* \u2014 under which a party cannot create a legal entitlement for itself using its own wrongful conduct240\u2014prevents Claimant from using its own non-compliance to the negotiation requirement in Article VI(3) to benefit itself at the expense of Respondent, which is the party protected by this condition precedent.241\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 161:25 to 162:3.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 162:8-19.\n\n120.\n\nRespondent's position is that Claimant would have been unable, even in the absence of an ICSID denunciation, to commence a second ICSID arbitration on the basis of its original consent to Murphy I, as its original consent was effective.\"242 Respondent refrained from stating its position on whether Claimant could have consented anew to ICSID arbitration had Respondent not denounced the ICSID Convention, on the basis that this is not the issue before the Tribunal.243\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 167:14-17.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 168:2-6.\n\n**Respondent's alleged breach of good faith, estoppel and preclusion principles**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***Background***\n----------------\n\n**A.

It notes that the *jurisprudence constante* and scholarly commentary at that time was that pre-consent waiting periods were not jurisdictional,246 and highlights the admission of Respondent, made in a different case, that its jurisdictional objection was unlikely to succeed.247 It further points out that noncompliance with waiting periods have been excused based on the futility of negotiations,248 which Respondent's ultimatum to investors to either comply with Law 42 or abandon their investments guaranteed in this case.249\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 79. Claimant stresses that ample time had passed between its filing of the request for ICSID Arbitration and the time that Ecuador passed Law 42 and received notice from Repsol, the Consortium's operator, for a violation of the Spain-Ecuador BIT based on the same facts. It also points out that it had engaged in negotiations with Respondent before and after the passage of Law 42.

Claimant explains that it was on the basis of these representations\u2014as well as on its own desire to \"avoid a long and costly jurisdictional procedure\"\u2014that it decided to withdraw its resubmitted claim and commence UNCITRAL arbitration instead.253 In doing so, Claimant contends that it accepted Respondent's position that Claimant did not validly consent to ICSID Arbitration.254\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 93; Hearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 117:8-11.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 93.\n\n**B.

Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n132.\n\nClaimant contends that judicial estoppel prevents Respondent from abandoning its previous position that Claimant did not validly consent to ICSID arbitration and now arguing that the validity of Claimant's consent causes this Tribunal to have no jurisdiction over the matter.272 In other words, the doctrine of estoppel holds Respondent to its previous position, under which consent to UNCITRAL arbitration is Claimant's first valid consent under the BIT.273 To hold otherwise would allow Respondent to secure an unfair advantage over Claimant, who would then be denied the opportunity to have its claim heard on the merits.274\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 105.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 105.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, paras. 147-148.\n\n133.\n\nClaimant also argues that estoppel prevents Respondent from withdrawing its previous position that Claimant could resubmit its dispute to an arbitral forum other than ICSID.275 According to Claimant, while Respondent objected to the resubmission of Claimant's ICSID claim, it also argued that Claimant would be allowed to pursue its claims in another forum. Claimant specifically points to Respondent's 28 July 2011 letter to ICSID, which states: \"If no operative consent exists, Article 26 [of the ICSID Convention] does not operate and the foreign national is free to pursue other remedies. This is exactly the situation of a claimant whose claim has been dismissed by an ICSID award for lack of jurisdiction.\"276 The letter further states that \"in case the ICSID tribunal has given an award in which it finds that the dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, a party may take that dispute to another forum for a decision on the merits.277\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, paras. 138-139.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 91, *citing* Ecuador's Letter to ICSID dated 28 July 2011, pp. 6-7, **CEX-18** ; Hearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 117:20 to 118:8.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 92, *citing* Ecuador's Letter to ICSID dated 28 July 2011, p. 7, **CEX-18**.\n\n134.\n\nClaimant contends that this case meets the \"more traditional notion of estoppel involving detrimental reliance.\"278 It identifies its \"detrimental reliance\" as the withdrawal of its refiled ICSID claim and the re-filing of its claim under the UNCITRAL Rules.279 Such reliance has been prejudicial, in that Claimant has had to incur legal costs to defend against Respondent's jurisdictional objections.280 Were this Tribunal to uphold Respondent's objections, Claimant notes that its reliance would be more prejudicial still.281\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 106, *citing* *Pan American* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 159, **RLA-20**.\n\nClaimant's Response, para. 107.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 140.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 140.\n\n135.\n\nClaimant contends that the principle of estoppel applies even if the representation involved concerns \"the conduct of the parties in construing their respective rights and duties,\" and is therefore not of fact but of law.282 It stresses that legal representations, and not just factual ones, can give Respondent an unfair advantage.283\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, para. 141, *citing* Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 127.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, paras. 149. In a case involving Respondent and Chevron, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit stressed that \"judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine\" that is not limited to \"contrary \u2018factual positions'\" because \"a change of legal position can be just as abusive of court processes and an opposing party as deliberate factual flip-flopping.\" Claimant's Rejoinder, paras. 142, 145-146, *citing Republic of Ecuador v.

TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------\n\n**Introduction**\n----------------\n\n159.\n\nArticle VI(2) of the US-Ecuador BIT provides that:\n\nIn the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedures; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n160.\n\nFor this provision to apply there must exist an \"investment dispute\" that \"cannot be settled amicably.\" In such circumstances, the investor may choose to submit the dispute under one of the three alternatives listed.\n\n161.\n\nIt is uncontested that this provision contains a classic fork-in-the-road provision and that the three alternatives are mutually exclusive.\n\n162.\n\nIn the present case, Murphy chose to submit the dispute in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3, which provide as follows:\n\n3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\"), provided that the Party is a party to such Convention; or\n\n(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or\n\n(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or\n\n(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(b) once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.\n\n163.\n\nMore precisely, in March 2008, Murphy commenced the ICSID Arbitration. On 15 December 2010, a majority of the tribunal in that arbitration declined jurisdiction on the ground that Claimant had failed to comply with the six-month negotiation period stipulated in Article VI(3)(a). The Murphy I Award was limited to this finding; the tribunal made no pronouncement, for instance, on the validity of Murphy's or Ecuador's consent to the ICSID Arbitration.\n\n164.\n\nOn 30 December 2010, in order to cure the defect identified in the Murphy I Award, Claimant initiated negotiations with Ecuador. In the meantime, on 6 July 2009, Ecuador had denounced the ICSID Convention with effect as of 7 January 2010. This notwithstanding, and given that Ecuador had declined to state whether it would agree to UNCITRAL arbitration in light of its withdrawal from the ICSID Convention, on 13 July 2010, Claimant recommenced arbitration against Ecuador under the ICSID Convention, relying on Ecuador's consent of 2008. Ecuador again raised objections to jurisdiction. As a result, Claimant withdrew its ICSID request on 19 August 2011 and on 21 September 2011, commenced arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules under Article VI(3)(a)(iii) of the BIT.\n\n165.\n\nIn these proceedings, Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, alleging *inter alia* that the word \"or\" between the arbitral options set out in Article VI(3)(a) is disjunctive and thus renders the choice between those fora mutually exclusive.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal recognises and the Parties have acknowledged that this is a case of first impression with an unprecedented factual matrix. The unique issue before the Tribunal can be stated as follows: can Claimant submit its claim to UNCITRAL arbitration under Article VI(3)(a) given that, first, its prior submission of the claim to ICSID arbitration in Murphy I was dismissed by the ICSID tribunal for lack of jurisdiction; that, second, Claimant recommenced arbitration against Ecuador under the ICSID Convention and later withdrew its request; and that, finally, ICSID arbitration is no longer available.\n\n167.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the Tribunal has carefully considered the pleadings and supporting materials of the Parties, both written and oral. The Tribunal shall rule on only those issues that are relevant for it to reach its decision.\n\n**Treaty Interpretation**\n-------------------------\n\n168.\n\nThe analysis of Respondent's jurisdictional objection necessarily begins with the specific language of Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT, as interpreted in accordance with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n169.\n\nArticle 31(1) of the Vienna Convention provides, in relevant part:\n\n1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n170.\n\nThe Tribunal shall thus examine the \"ordinary meaning\" of the terms of Article VI(3)(a) \"in their context and in light of [the BIT's] object and purpose.\"\n\n171.\n\nThe Tribunal shall also be guided by the principle of *effet utile*, which requires tribunals to interpret treaty provisions \"so as to give them their fullest weight and effect consistent with the normal sense of the words and with other parts of the text, and in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every part of the text.\"336 The Tribunal notes that the Parties do not dispute the application of this principle but instead disagree as to *how* the principle should be applied.\n\nR. Gardiner, Treaty Interpretation (2008), p. 64.\n\n**A. Ordinary meaning of Article VI(3)**\n----------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nIt is Respondent's case that Article VI(3)(a) lists mutually exclusive and irrevocable choices between arbitral fora. The Tribunal notes, however, that there is no explicit limitation to this effect in the text of the provision and that it is plausible that the word \"or\" in Article VI(3)(a) conveys inclusiveness as Claimant submits. Absent text explicitly signifying a limitation, it is Respondent's burden to establish that such a limitation exists and that Claimant's interpretation is implausible. The Tribunal considers that Respondent has not met its burden in this case.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Article VI(3)(a)\u2014interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms\u2014lists arbitral fora that are available to the investor, but does not signify the mutual exclusivity of the arbitral fora or otherwise require the selection of a single choice among them. Unlike Article VI(2) of the BIT, Article VI(3)(a) does not, therefore, operate as a fork-in-the-road.\n\n174.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal notes, first, that in support of its position on the ordinary meaning of the BIT, Respondent has referred to treaties that it alleges are similar to the US-Ecuador BIT. The Tribunal considers those treaties to be informative to the present exercise only to the extent that its interpretation of the US-Ecuador BIT needs to be supplemented.\n\n175.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's argument based on Article II of the New York Convention; namely, that an inclusive meaning of \"or\" would allow the investor to consent to more than one arbitral forum, thereby leading to the creation of multiple agreements in writing in violation of Article II of the New York Convention. As Claimant points out, Article II of the New York Convention concerns the existence of an arbitration agreement. When an investor selects an arbitral forum by commencing an arbitration, the standing offer of the State is met by the acceptance of the investor which thus completes the arbitration agreement. While there may be several options of arbitral fora making up the State's standing offer to arbitrate, only one arbitration agreement is created whenever an investor selects an arbitral forum.\n\n176.\n\nThird, the Tribunal finds that the structural difference between Article 24(3) of the 2004 US Model BIT and Article VI(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT prevents the former provision from being helpful in the Tribunal's interpretation of the latter. As pointed out by Claimant, Article 24(3) imposes international arbitration as the sole mechanism for dispute resolution, while Article VI(2)(c) of the US-Ecuador BIT presents international arbitration \"in accordance with the terms of [Article VI(3)]\" as just one option for dispute resolution among two other options, as listed in Articles VI(2)(a) and VI(2)(b), respectively.\n\n177.\n\nThe disagreement between the Parties on the meaning of \"under one of the following alternatives\" in Article VI(2) can be characterised as an extension of their dispute over the effect of \"or\" in Article VI(3)(a). Both Parties agree that Article VI(2) operates as a fork-in-the-road. But the question is whether this operation is triggered by the word \"or\" (as Respondent argues) or by the phrase \"under one of the following alternatives\" (as Claimant argues).\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the presence of the phrase \"under one of the following alternatives\" in Article VI(2) and its corresponding absence in Article VI(3)(a) are meaningful. The inclusion of this language in Article VI(2) puts its operation as a fork-in-the-road provision beyond doubt. The fact that this language is absent from Article VI(3)(a) satisfies the Tribunal that this provision does not operate as a fork-in-the-road. The Tribunal cannot read a limitation into a provision that does not have a limitation. Moreover, the absence of the phrase \"under one of the following alternatives\" enhances the plausibility of assigning a meaning to Article VI(3)(a) under which the \"or\" is inclusive only.\n\n179.\n\nFrom a literal standpoint alone, the *effet utile* principle dictates a textual interpretation of the BIT under which the word \"or\" in both Articles VI(2) and VI(3)(a) denotes inclusiveness, and the phrase \"under one of the following alternatives\" in Article VI(2) is not superfluous to the text. Rather, the phrase is necessary to establish a restrictive definition.\n\n180.\n\nThe Tribunal does not disagree with Respondent's argument that treaty language can have a confirmatory or clarificatory purpose and that even such language must be given weight and effect. The principle of *effet utile* mandates not just that treaty terms be given weight and effect, but also that they be accorded \"their fullest weight and effect consistent with the normal sense of the words and with other parts of the text, and in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be attributed to every part of the text.\"337 The Tribunal therefore disagrees with Respondent's statement that the *effet utile* principle \"does not require a maximum effect be given to a text.\"338\n\nR. Gardiner, Treaty Interpretation (2008), p. 64.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 48:13-14.\n\n181.\n\nThat the *effet utile* principle mandates the selection of a better meaning among other plausible meanings for the treaty terms must be correct. Were the Tribunal not to seek the better meaning for the treaty terms, then all plausible definitions of such terms would stand on equal footing and lead to an impasse due to the impossibility of either ascertaining a single meaning for the text or reconciling several equally valid but conflicting meanings.\n\n182.\n\nA broader application of the *effet utile* principle in conjunction with an analysis of the object and purpose of the BIT leads to the same result. Claimant argued that \"\u2018or' could be read consistent with the *effet utile* principle to mean that the choice is exclusive insofar as it results in a decision on the merits....\"339 In answer to this, Respondent stressed that the fork-in-the-road effect of Article VI(2) of the BIT is replicated exactly in Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT, stating that the choice of one arbitral forum is exclusive, irrevocable, and irreversible: \"You [cannot] make another choice of forum, whether or not there is a resolution on the merits of the claim.\"340 Specifically, Respondent argued that the disjunctive function of the word \"or\" in Article VI(2) could not be conditioned on Claimant receiving a decision on the merits and, therefore, neither should this be the case for Article VI(3)(a).341 Respondent also highlighted the absence of language in Article VI(3)(a) that referred to the possibility of obtaining a decision on the merits as a condition for its effectiveness.342\n\nHearing (22 May 2013), 175:18-23.\n\nHearing (22 May 2013), 159:13-15.\n\nHearing (22 May 2013), 160:8-12.\n\nHearing (22 May 2013), 160:18-20.\n\n183.\n\nWhile the Tribunal acknowledges that Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT\u2014as well as Article VI(2)\u2014does not explicitly refer to a decision on the merits, it nevertheless finds that an interpretation of both provisions in accordance with the *effet utile* principle mandates that such a result be obtained. The basis for this is the object and purpose of the BIT, which will be discussed in Section C.\n\n**B. Context of Article VI(3)**\n-------------------------------\n\n184.\n\nAs previously indicated, Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention defines context as follows:\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:\n\n(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;\n\n(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n185.\n\nThe Tribunal is cognisant of the Parties' dispute as to whether the Message of Submittal and the Letter of Submittal constitute part of the context for the purpose of an analysis under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. The Tribunal finds it unnecessary to resolve this dispute. It remains the case that both Parties have relied on these materials in support of their respective positions.\n\n186.\n\nThe Tribunal finds nothing in the context of Article VI(3) that would discredit the results of the previous analysis of the ordinary meaning of that treaty provision. While the contextual indications highlighted by Respondent may indicate disjunction between arbitral fora, these indications are consistent with the Tribunal's interpretation that the disjunctive meaning of the word \"or\" in Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT is only triggered once there is a decision on the merits.\n\n**C. Object and Purpose of the BIT**\n------------------------------------\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its dismissal of the Respondent's interpretation of Article VI(3)(a) sufficiently disposes of the jurisdictional objection of the Respondent, but further observes that the interpretation advocated by Claimant most accords to the object and purpose of the BIT.\n\n188.\n\nOne of the objectives of the Treaty is to give the investor access to a meaningful arbitration. This is evidenced by both Article VI(2), which prioritises the amicable settlement of disputes but offers alternatives for dispute resolution in the event that such settlement is impossible, and Article VI(3)(a), which gives the investor the option of submitting \"the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration.\" It is particularly noteworthy that Black's Law Dictionary defines \"settlement\" as \"an agreement ending a dispute or lawsuit.\"343\n\nBlack's Law Dictionary (9th ed. 2009).\n\n189.\n\nThis objective is further evidenced in the US Letter of Submittal for the US-Ecuador BIT, which lists as one of the principal BIT objectives to ascertain that \"[n]ationals and companies of either Party, in investment disputes with the host government, have access to binding international arbitration, without first resorting to domestic courts.\"344\n\n7 September 1993, Letter of Submittal of the US-Ecuador Treaty, at **REX-15**.\n\n190.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that if it were to dismiss Claimant's claim on the basis of Respondent's jurisdictional objection, the dispute would not be settled and Claimant would not have access to a binding resolution of the merits of its case through international arbitration.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes Respondent's argument that one of the objectives of a fork-in-the-road provision is to prevent a multiplicity of proceedings with respect to the same investment dispute.345 Because this case involves the replacement of an unavailable forum with an available one, and because the one arbitral forum to which Claimant could have theoretically resubmitted its dismissed claim is now unavailable, there can be no concern here about a duplication of proceedings. Furthermore, and by way of a more general observation, fork-in-the-road provisions typically distinguish between contract claims and treaty claims. They are not designed to prevent the kind situation that arises here.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 34:23- 35:5.\n\n192.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes Respondent's argument that \"there is no extrinsic object and purpose of the Treaty of guaranteeing an adjudication on the merits of an investor's claim whether in the courts, whether in a previously agreed procedure, or in treaty arbitration.\"346 The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. As Claimant has pointed out, access to dispute resolution is in fact structured so as to lead to a decision on the merits.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 46:8-11.\n\n193.\n\nFurthermore, that a claimant in an international arbitration is not always entitled to a decision on the merits of its claims does not mean that the said claimant could not be entitled to such a decision in some cases or, more particularly, under the unique facts of this case. And with regard to this specific case, the Tribunal finds that the object and purpose of the US-Ecuador BIT\u2014as manifested in the references to the \"settlement\" of disputes and \"binding international arbitration\"\u2014operate in conjunction with the circumstances of this case to mandate that Claimant be allowed to obtain a decision on the merits of its claim, subject to the Tribunal's determination of Respondent's other jurisdictional objections.\n\n194.\n\nIt is noteworthy that (1) Claimant has cured the procedural defect that led to the dismissal of the first ICSID arbitration; (2) the resubmission jurisprudence suggests that ICSID arbitration would still have been available to Claimant were it not for Respondent's withdrawal from the ICSID Convention; and (3) Claimant may have been led to believe that UNCITRAL arbitration was acceptable to Respondent, and may have withdrawn its refiled ICSID claim on that basis.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal is convinced that the resubmission jurisprudence presented by Claimant establishes that the failure of a party to abide by the so-called \"cooling-off period\" is a curable procedural defect and not an absolute jurisdictional hurdle. In *Waste Management v. Mexico*, for example, the tribunal delineated between the underlying rights of a claim and the jurisdictional requirements that attach to the filing of a claim, which explains why the tribunal in that case accepted a claim that was refiled by the claimant after that claim was initially dismissed for the claimant's failure to meet a jurisdictional requirement.347 In *Daimler v. Argentina*, the tribunal dismissed a claim for the claimant's failure to meet a jurisdictional requirement but at the same time noted that the claimant could bring its claims once it fulfilled the so-called conditions precedent to arbitration.348\n\n*Waste Management II* Decision on Preliminary Objections, para. 36, **CLA-190**.\n\n*Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/01, Award, August 22, 2012, para. 281, **RLA-145**.\n\n196.\n\nRespondent itself characterises the relevant resubmission jurisprudence as \"[at most] stand[ing] for the proposition that an investor who has consented to an arbitral procedure might be able to resubmit its claims for arbitration, in the case of a curable jurisdictional defect, to the same arbitral forum, provided, of course, that the conditions for accessing that procedure are met.\"349 From this characterisation, the Tribunal notes that Respondent itself seems to take issue not with the right of Claimant to resubmit its dispute *per se* but, rather, with Claimant's resubmission of its dispute to an arbitral forum other than ICSID.\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 49:23 to 50:3.\n\n197.\n\nUnder the circumstances of this case, Respondent's interpretation of Article VI(3)(a) entirely forecloses Claimant's access to international arbitration. The Tribunal considers such a result to run counter to the object and purpose of the BIT and to be \"manifestly absurd and unreasonable\" under the meaning of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges that Respondent was fully within its right to withdraw from the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal recognises, however, that Respondent's denunciation of the ICSID Convention forms part of the factual matrix that must be considered in its evaluation of the results to which the Parties' respective interpretations of Articles VI(2) and VI(3)(a) of the BIT would lead.\n\n199.\n\nAt the hearing, the Tribunal asked the Parties whether, under the circumstances of this case and assuming that Respondent had not withdrawn from the ICSID Convention, Claimant could have validly refiled its claim with ICSID, as it had since complied with the six-month negotiation period indicated in Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT.350 As previously stated, Claimant answered this question in the affirmative. Respondent answered that Claimant would not have been able to commence a second ICSID arbitration based on its original consent in Murphy I,351 but refrained from expressing a position on whether Claimant could have consented anew to ICSID arbitration were it not for Respondent's withdrawal from the ICSID Convention.352\n\nHearing Transcript (21 May 2013), 132:20-133:7.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 167:14-17.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 168:2-6.\n\n200.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this question must be answered in the affirmative. Specifically, because Claimant has since cured the procedural defect that led to the dismissal of its claim in Murphy I, it could have refiled its claim for resolution via ICSID arbitration had Respondent not renounced the ICSID Convention. On both its own analysis of the resubmission jurisprudence and Respondent's characterisation of it, the Tribunal is satisfied that a claimant that has since cured the procedural defect that had led to the dismissal of its initial claim can refile its claim in the same forum. Since this same forum is unavailable in this case, in keeping with the object and purpose of the Treaty, Claimant shall have recourse to UNCITRAL arbitration.\n\n**Validity of Claimant's Consent to Murphy I**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nEven were the Tribunal to accept Respondent's position that Article VI(3)(a) operates as a fork-in-the-road, it finds that the consent of Claimant to the present UNCITRAL arbitration constitutes its first valid consent to international arbitration under Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT.\n\n202.\n\nOn this issue, Respondent argues that an investor can select an arbitral forum that then triggers the fork-in-the-road effect of Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT even before the fulfilment of the condition precedent; the effect of the non-fulfilment of the condition precedent is that the selection would not then trigger the consent of the State to arbitration.353 Respondent also submits that when a party has itself prevented a condition precedent from being fulfilled, that party may not seek to derive benefit from its own breach of the condition; in other words, in this case, Murphy cannot seek to have its own election of ICSID rendered invalid by invoking its own failure to respect the negotiating period requirement.354\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 161:12-16.\n\nHearing Transcript (22 May 2013), 162:8-19.\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal considers it clear from the text of Article VI(3)(a) that Claimant\u2014or the \"company concerned\" in this case\u2014could only \"choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration\" after meeting two conditions. First, that Claimant had not submitted the dispute for settlement under Articles VI(2)(a) and VI(2)(b). That Claimant satisfies this condition is not disputed. Second, that \"six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose.\" The Murphy I tribunal dismissed Claimant's ICSID case precisely because Claimant had not met this requirement\u2014which the Murphy I tribunal had found to be jurisdictional. The Murphy I tribunal defined the date on which the dispute arose as 29 February 2008, which is when Murphy wrote to Ecuador alleging a breach of the Treaty. The Murphy I tribunal simply held that it had no jurisdiction over Claimant's claim and did not address the issue of the validity of either Claimant's or Respondent's consent in respect of the ICSID Arbitration. The Tribunal finds that the invalidity of Claimant's choice of ICSID arbitration is a necessary consequence and corollary of the decision of the Murphy I tribunal.\n\n204.\n\nArticle VI(3)(a) explicitly provides a condition precedent to Claimant's valid selection of an arbitral forum and its acceptance of the host State's offer of consent of international arbitration. Because Claimant did not make a valid choice of forum and therefore did not properly accept the State's offer of consent, the consent that it gave in the present proceedings to UNCITRAL arbitration is the first instance of proper consent under Article VI(3)(a).\n\n**VI. DISPOSITIF**\n------------------\n\n1. Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on Article VI of the Treaty is dismissed.\n\n2.

Angelynn Meya and Hana Doumal of Foley Hoag LLP in Paris.\n\n**II. OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThis dispute arises out of a series of legislative measures taken by Ecuador in connection with its hydrocarbons industry. The measures were taken following the significant increase in oil prices that began in the first half of the 2000s.\n\n4.\n\nAt the heart of this dispute is the operation of the Participation Contract concluded in 1996 between a consortium of foreign investors (\" **Consortium** \") in which Murphy held an interest through its 100% owned subsidiary, Murphy Ecuador Oil Company Limited (\" **Murphy Ecuador** \"), and the predecessor of the state-owned entity Petroecuador. According to Claimant, the Participation Contract operated such that the Consortium would receive a share of the production calculated on the basis of the volume of production and without regard to oil prices. However, when oil prices spiked, the government enacted legislation, known as Law 42, that provided that Ecuador would participate in the Consortium's profits from the sale of crude oil if the market value of the oil exceeded a reference price (\" **Law 42** \"). Initially the government set the level of its participation at a minimum of 50 percent. Several months later the government raised the level of its participation to 99 percent.\n\n5.\n\nClaimant submits that Law 42 constituted a unilateral and unlawful modification of the Participation Contract by Ecuador and had a significantly detrimental effect on the financial performance of Claimant's investment. It contends that it had no other choice but to forego its investment by selling its interest in the Consortium, which it did in March 2009.\n\n6.\n\nMurphy claims that Law 42 breached Ecuador's obligations under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment (\" **BIT** \", \" **Treaty** \" or \" **US-Ecuador BIT** \"). It seeks reparation in the form of compensation for (1) the payments Murphy Ecuador made to Ecuador under Law 42; (2) the cash flow that it would have received through Murphy Ecuador from the date of its sale through the end of the Participation Contract's term; and (3) interest.\n\n7.\n\nAccording to Ecuador, the rise in oil prices was exceptional and unexpected. In light of it, virtually all oil producing countries implemented legal adjustments, on the one hand, to maintain their agreements with petroleum sector operators and, on the other hand, to protect public interest over natural resources. Ecuador contends that Law 42 was one such measure, legitimately instituted in accordance with Ecuadorean constitutional and procedural requirements.\n\n8.\n\nFollowing the implementation of Law 42, Ecuador entered into negotiations with the Consortium\u2014as well as with other operators\u2014to agree modified terms to the Participation Contract. It states that while negotiations proceeded successfully with the other Consortium members, they did not with Murphy. Murphy refused to agree to a modified contract and elected instead to sell its interest in the Consortium\u2014which it did profitably\u2014and pursue arbitration, first at ICSID (unsuccessfully), and then here.\n\n9.\n\nEcuador argues that Claimant has failed to allege losses that are distinct and separate from the losses allegedly suffered by its former subsidiary, Murphy Ecuador. After Murphy sold Murphy Ecuador, the latter settled all claims related to those losses and withdrew its claims, with prejudice, from the Repsol ICSID arbitration that the Consortium had commenced under the Participation Contract, in exchange for a new oil production agreement.\n\n10.\n\nEcuador denies having breached the US-Ecuador BIT. It rejects Claimant's assertion that Law 42 effected an alteration of the contracting parties' agreed formula governing their sharing of the extracted petroleum. According to Ecuador, Law 42 is a \"matter of taxation\" and thus expressly excluded from arbitration by the tax carve-out clause in the Treaty. The only claim that is capable of surviving the tax carve-out is expropriation, which Ecuador rebuts on several grounds. It seeks the dismissal of all of Claimant's claims.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n***A. Commencement of these Proceedings***\n------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nClaimant commenced these proceedings by Notice of Arbitration dated 21 September 2011 under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 1976 (\" **UNCITRAL Rules** \") pursuant to Article VI of the Treaty.\n\n12.\n\nArticle VI of the BIT provides:\n\n1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute settlement procedures; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\"), provided that the Party is a party to such Convention; or\n\n(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or\n\n(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or\n\n(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the dispute.\n\n(b) once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in the consent.\n\n4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent, together with the written consent of the national or company when given under paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:\n\n(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for Purposes of Chapter II of the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules; and\n\n(b) an \"agreement in writing\" for purposes of Article II of the United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958 (\"New York Convention\").\n\n5. Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article shall be held in a state that is a party to the New York Convention.\n\n13.\n\nOn 14 March 2012, Claimant appointed Professor Kaj Hober as arbitrator. On 12 April 2012, Ecuador appointed Professor Georges Abi-Saab as arbitrator. On 25 May 2012, Professors Hober and Abi-Saab jointly appointed Professor Bernard Hanotiau as Presiding Arbitrator.\n\n14.\n\nTerms of Appointment were concluded on 3 September 2012.1 On 4 September 2012, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 which contained a partial procedural timetable and rules of procedure.\n\nTerms of Appointment (3 September 2012).\n\n15.\n\nClaimant filed its Statement of Claim (\" **Statement of Claim** \") on 17 September 2012.2\n\nStatement of Claim (17 September 2012), accompanied by the first witness statement of Mr. Ignacio Herrera, the expert report of Dr. Hernan Perez Loose with annexes, the expert report of Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA with attachments, and exhibits **CEX-1** to **CEX-167** and legal authorities **CLA-1** to **CLA-108**. Claimant dispatched relevant Spanish translations of the above on 15 October 2012, along with English translations of selected documents and a corrected Statement of Claim, Errata Sheet, and missing exhibits (including **CEX-168**).\n\n16.\n\nOn 17 October 2012, Ecuador submitted its Objections to Jurisdiction (\" **Objections to Jurisdiction** \") and requested that the Tribunal determine its jurisdictional objections in a preliminary, bifurcated phase.3\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction (17 October 2012), para. 321, accompanied by exhibits **REX-1** to **REX-33** and legal authorities **RLA-1** to **RLA-194**. On 22 October 2012, Ecuador submitted a corrected version of its Objections to Jurisdiction and an errata sheet. Respondent submitted relevant Spanish translations of the above on 15 November 2012.\n\n17.\n\nOn 16 November 2012, Claimant filed its Response to Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction (\" **Response to Objections to Jurisdiction** \") and opposed Respondent's request for bifurcation4\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction (16 November 2012), accompanied by exhibits **CEX-169** to CEX-192 and legal authorities **CLA-109** to **CLA-232**. Claimant submitted relevant Spanish translations of the above on 15 December 2012.\n\n18.\n\nFollowing an earlier agreement between the Parties that the Presiding Arbitrator alone would decide the Respondent's request for bifurcation,5 on 19 December 2012, the Presiding Arbitrator issued a Decision on Respondent's Request for Bifurcation (\" **Bifurcation Decision** \"). He directed that Respondent's jurisdictional objection based on Article VI(3)(a) of the Treaty would be determined in a preliminary phase and that the remaining jurisdictional objections, if necessary, would be joined to the merits.6\n\nRespondent agreed to this on 10 December 2012, and Claimant agreed to this on 13 December 2012.\n\nBifurcation Decision, para. 74. The Bifurcation Decision further established a timetable for the preliminary jurisdictional phase and scheduled a hearing for 21 and 22 May 2013. The Permanent Court of Arbitration (\" **PCA** \") provided the Parties with a Spanish translation of the Bifurcation Decision on 14 January 2013.\n\n***B.

Mejia-Salazar.\n\n31.\n\nIn late October 2014, the Parties agreed to exchange between themselves copies of exhibits and legal authorities not previously submitted in the arbitration that they intended to use at the hearing. The exchange occurred on 5 November 2014. Respondent objected to the submission of all but two of Claimant's new exhibits and all of its legal authorities. Claimant opposed Respondent's objections.\n\n32.\n\nAlso in late October, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that notwithstanding its requests that Claimant make Messrs. George Michael Shirley and Ignacio Herrera available for crossexamination, they were respectively \"not available\" and \"not willing\" to appear. As a result, on 29 October 2014, Respondent requested that the testimony of Mr. Shirley\u2014which consisted of the witness statement he had submitted in the ICSID proceedings commenced by Murphy against Ecuador on 3 March 2008 (\" **Murphy ICSID Arbitration** \"),14 and which had been filed in these proceedings as a factual exhibit, CEX-152\u2014, and the witness statements of Mr. Herrera be withdrawn or struck from the record.\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4.\n\n33.\n\nOn 12 November 2014, the Presiding Arbitrator (on behalf of the Tribunal) held a conference call with the Parties to discuss Respondent's request to strike CEX-152 and the witness statements of Mr. Herrera from the record, as well as Respondent's objection to Claimant's submission of new factual exhibits and additional legal authorities.\n\n34.\n\nOn 13 November 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, in which it (1) denied the Respondent's request to strike CEX-152 and the witness statements of Mr. Herrera; and (2) admitted the Parties' additional legal authorities and Claimant's additional exhibits.\n\n35.\n\nOn 17 to 20 November 2014, a hearing on jurisdiction and merits (\" **Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits** \") was held in Washington D.C. Claimant was represented at the hearing by Messrs. Craig S. Miles, Roberto Aguirre Luzi, Esteban A. Leccese, Santiago Maqueda, Tim Kistner, and Francisco Roldan, and Mmes. Anita Alvarez, Carol Tamez, and Sarah Z. Vasani. Respondent was represented by Messrs. Mark A.

Aviles-Alfaro, Kathryn Kalinowski, Kathern Schmidt, Angelynn Meya, Hana Doumal, and Diana Tsutieva.\n\n36.\n\nOn 27 November 2014, the Tribunal provided the Parties with a list of questions on which it required further submissions in the form of two rounds of post-hearing briefs.\n\n37.\n\nOn 9 January 2015, the Parties submitted their first round of post-hearing briefs (\" **Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief** \" and \" **Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief** \").15\n\nOn 6 and 7 February 2015, Claimant and Respondent, respectively, submitted the Spanish translations of their first post-hearing briefs.\n\n38.\n\nOn 26 January 2015, the Parties submitted their second round of post-hearing briefs (\" **Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief** \" and \" **Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief** \").16\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief was submitted with legal authority **CLA-334**. Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief was submitted with legal authority **RLA-456**. On 17 February 2015, Claimant submitted the Spanish translation of its Second Post-Hearing Brief. On 23 February 2015, Respondent submitted the Spanish translation of its Second Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n39.\n\nOn 2 December 2015, the Tribunal requested the Parties to confer and agree on a timetable for the filing of costs submissions and the submission of comments on the opposing Party's claims.\n\n40.\n\nOn 14 December 2015, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they would file their costs submissions for the post-jurisdictional phase by 15 January 2016, and their comments on the opposing Party's claims by 29 January 2016.\n\n41.\n\nThe Parties filed their costs claims for the post-jurisdictional phase on 15 January 2016 (\" **Claimant's Costs Submission** \" and \" **Respondent's Costs Submission** \"), and submitted comments on the opposing side's costs claims on 29 January 2016 (\" **Reply to Respondent's Costs Submission** \" and \" **Reply to Claimant's Costs Submission** \").\n\n**IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS**\n--------------------------\n\n***A. Murphy's relationship with Canam and Murphy Ecuador***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nMurphy operated in Ecuador through Murphy Ecuador Oil Company Limited (\" **Murphy Ecuador** \"), a wholly-owned, Bermudan subsidiary of Canam Offshore Limited (\" **Canam** \"). According to Claimant, Canam was incorporated in the Bahamas in November 1966 and acquired by Murphy on 1 June 1970.17 Canam is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Murphy. Up until 2004, Murphy Ecuador was a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Murphy. In 2004, Murphy transferred Murphy Ecuador to Canam.18\n\nFirst Navigant Expert Report, para. 15.\n\nFirst Navigant Expert Report, para. 15; **NAV-5**, Murphy Oil Corporation 2003 10-K, Exhibit 13, p. 11; **NAV-6**, Murphy Oil Corporation 2004 Annual Report, Exhibit 21.\n\n***B. The Ecuadorian oil industry***\n------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nFrom the 1960s onwards, oil exploration and development became a major activity in Ecuador. At that time, Ecuador had adopted the \"concession contract\" model according to which investors paid the Government for exploration and exploitation rights under liberal concession terms.19 Following significant increases in oil prices in the 1970s, Ecuador nationalised its oil industry. Concession contracts with foreign investors were terminated and transferred to the State oil company, *Corporation Estatal Petrolera Ecuatoriana* (\" **CEPE** \"), the immediate predecessor of Petroecuador.20\n\n*Anderson*, Ecuador, in: Randall (ed.), THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF LATIN AMERICA IN THE POSTWAR PERIOD (1997) p. 252, **CEX-141**.\n\n*The World Bank*, Ecuador: An Agenda for Recovery and Sustained Growth, WORLD BANK COUNTRY STUDIES (1984) p. 89, **CEX-143**.\n\n44.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Ecuador enacted several reforms in a renewed attempt to attract foreign investment to its oil industry. One such reform consisted of a modification to Ecuador's Hydrocarbons Law to allow Petroecuador to enter into \"service contracts\" with foreign investors.21 Under the service contract model, investors could bid for exploration areas. If they found exploitable reserves, the contractor would undertake the necessary exploration and development of the reserves in return for a fee from the Government for the contractor's services and reimbursement of its costs. The contractor would not enjoy any share in the oil produced. Petroecuador would maintain ownership over all oil production.22\n\nLaw No. 101, promulgated in Official Register No. 306 of August 13, 1982, **CEX-144**.\n\n*The World Bank*, Ecuador: An Agenda for Recovery and Sustained Growth, WORLD BANK COUNTRY STUDIES (1984), **CEX-143**.\n\n45.\n\nThere were several downsides to the service contract model. First, there was little incentive for contractors to develop the reserves to their maximum capacity. The payment from the Government was the same regardless of the volume of oil production. Also, when oil prices were low, there was a risk that the cost of the contractor's services would exceed the revenue obtained by the Government from oil sales. Additionally, the Government could not control the contractor's costs and there was no real incentive for contractors to keep costs down.\n\n***C. The original investment in Ecuador under the service contract model***\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nMurphy Ecuador's original investments in Ecuador involved three separate oil exploration and production projects governed by service contracts, in respect of three areas: Block 16 of the Amazon Region of Ecuador (\" **Block 16** \"); the Bogi-Capiron Common Reservoirs\u2014an area adjacent to Block 16 (\" **Bogi-Capiron** \")\u2014; and the Tivacuno area of Ecuador's Amazon Region, adjacent to Block 16 in the north (\" **Tivacuno** \").\n\n47.\n\nThe first contract concerned Block 16. On 27 January 1986, Petroecuador and a consortium of oil companies comprised of Conoco Ecuador Ltd. (\" **Conoco** \"), Overseas Petroleum and Investment Corporation, Diamond Shamrock South America Petroleum B.V., and Nomeco Latin America Inc. (\" **Consortium** \") executed the Service Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 16 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region (\" **Block 16 Service Contract** \").23 The Consortium appointed Conoco as the initial operator.24\n\nService Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 16 of the Ecuadorian Amazon Region (27 January 1986), **CEX-29**.\n\nJoint Operating Agreement and Accounting Procedure between Overseas Petroleum and Investment Corporation, Conoco Ecuador Ltd., Diamond Shamrock South America Petroleum B.V. and Nomeco Latin America Inc. for Operations under Ecuadorian Amazon Block 16 Risk Service Contract (7 February 1986), Article 3.7, **CEX-30**.\n\n48.\n\nOn 28 July 1987, Conoco assigned a 10% interest in the Block 16 Service Contract to Murphy Ecuador (then known as Lowland Marine Ltd) and another 10% interest to Canam.25 At that time, both Murphy Ecuador and Canam were subsidiaries of Murphy.\n\nDeed of Assignment of Rights and Obligations by and between Conoco Ecuador Ltd., Lowland Marine Ltd. and Canam Offshore Ltd. (28 July 1987), **CEX-31**. *See also* Murphy Ecuador Incorporation and Name Change Certificates (Aug. 1987), **REX-3**.\n\n49.\n\nThe second contract concerned the Bogi-Capiron Common Reservoirs. On 20 August 1991, Petroproduccion, a subsidiary of Petroecuador, and the Consortium\u2014which by that time included Maxus Ecuador Inc., Murphy Ecuador and Canam in addition to the original members\u2014executed an Operating Agreement for Unitized Exploitation of the Bogi-Capiron Common Reservoirs (\" **Bogi-Capiron Contract** \").26 The Bogi-Capiron Contract was operated and administered in conjunction with the Block 16 Service Contract.27\n\nOperating Agreement for Unitized Exploitation of the Bogi-Capiron Common Reservoirs (20 August 1991), **CEX-32**.\n\nOperating Agreement for Unitized Exploitation of the Bogi-Capiron Common Reservoirs (20 August 1991), Clause Fourth: Object and Scope 4.3, **CEX-32**.\n\n50.\n\nOn 21 April 1992, Petroproduccion and Petroecuador and the Consortium\u2014which then consisted of Maxus Ecuador Inc., Overseas Petroleum and Investment Corporation, Nomeco Latin America Inc., Murphy Ecuador and Canam\u2014executed a Specific Services Contract for the Development and Production of Crude Oil in the Tivacuno Area (\" **Tivacuno Contract** \").28\n\n[ *intentionally left blank* ]\n\nSpecific Services Contract for the Development and Production of Crude Oil in the Tivacuno Area (21 April 1992), **CEX-34**.\n\n51.\n\nMurphy's ownership structure and share in the projects (as of 2004) is depicted below:\n\n52.\n\nThe map below shows the location of Block 16 as well as other blocks operated by other contractors.\n\n53.\n\nFrom 1986 to 1996 the Block 16 Sendee Contract governed the relationship between the Consortium and Petroecuador. Under its terms. exploration and production operations in Block 16 and the Bogi-Capiron field were earned out by the Consortium in exchange for the fees set forth in the Block 16 Service Contact. The Consortium also operated the Tivacuno field under the Tivacuno Contact.\n\n54.\n\nConoco's first oil discovery occurred in the first half of 1987.29 As a result, the Consortium submitted development plans for the consideration of Petroecuador.30 The plans included an economic analysis of commerciality based on investment and production costs and anticipated production volumes of crude oil and a per barrel price of USD 15.50.31 According to Respondent, the Government would approve the exploitation phase if it determined that the discovered reserves were \"commercially exploitable\" and capable of generating revenues to ensure a 15% profit margin for Petroecuador.32 The Ministry of Energy and Mines approved the plans in September 1991, at which point the development phase of the exploitation portion of the Block 16 Service Contract became effective.33 Production from Block 16 began in December 1994.\n\nTexaco Petroleum Company, Monthly Exploration and Scout Report for May 1987 (8 June 1987), p. 3, **REX-38**.\n\nExecutive Summary, Plan of Development Block 16 (August 1991 Update), paras. 3.1, 12.0, **REX-40**.\n\nExecutive Summary, Plan of Development Block 16 (August 1991 Update), para. 11.4, **REX-40**.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 41; First Larrea Witness Statement, paras. 5-7; First Pastor Witness Statement, para. 4.\n\nMinisterial Resolution No. 557, published in *Official Gazette* No. 779 (27 September 1991), **REX-41**.\n\n55.\n\nBy 1995, it had become apparent to the Government that the sale of crude oil from Block 16 was insufficient to cover the costs and expenditures of the Consortium as well as provide a return to the Government. Governmental authorities reported that \"the State Enterprise has received absolutely nothing so far as a result of exploitation from this contract.\"34\n\nParticipation Contract, Supporting Document D (Report on Modification of Contract with Maxus Consortium (Block 16) from Chief of the Joint Command of the Armed Forces to Minister of Energy and Mines, President of CEL, 11 November 1996, para. 2.b.), **CEX-36**.\n\n56.\n\nThe poor results under the Block 16 Service Contract and certain other contracts prompted Ecuador to review the contractual arrangements governing Block 16 and other similar projects.35 Ecuador sought to convert the service contracts to participation contracts under which the investors would own a share of oil production but assume their own costs and, inherently, the risk of low oil prices. Such an arrangement would provide an incentive to contractors to develop the reserves to their full potential. As was the case with the service contracts, the ownership of the resources would remain with the State, but the remuneration to the contractor would be based on a production-sharing modality provided for in the contract.\n\n*See* *Perenco Ecuador Limited v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Remaining Issues of Jurisdiction and on Liability, 12 September 2014, paras. 56-57, **CLA-329** / **RLA-452** (\" ***Perenco*** **Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability** \"); *Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador (formerly Burlington* *Resources Inc. and others v.

On 29 November 1993, the amendment\u2014also known as Law 44\u2014was implemented through Decree 1417.36 In a statement preceding the change in the Hydrocarbons Law, the Ecuadorian President Duran Ballen\u2014in office from August 1992\u2014stated:\n\n[T]he limited financial resources that the country has [...] do not justify PETROECUADOR's assumption of all the risk involved in exploration activities; such risk must be shared with international petroleum companies. [\u2026]\n\nThe Services Contract has become an extremely complex contract in terms of management and control, due to the relationship of dependency created among the various State agencies. Moreover, the provision for mandatory reimbursement of the contractor's investments, costs and expenses has significantly reduced the participation of the State in the economic benefits of oil exploration and production in medium and small fields.\n\nFinally, the Service Contract does not permit the contracting company to have a production flow of its own. This characteristic goes against the interest and *raison d'etre* of international oil companies, for the majority of whom the availability of production is an essential aspect of marketing in international markets.\n\nThe new proposed contract\u2014the participation contract\u2014will allow Ecuador to position itself at an internationally competitive level for attracting venture capital, because the contractor company, through the bidding process, shall set the economic conditions for the compensation for its investments. The State, in any case and whichever the production level, shall have priority to receive a share of the production of the area under the contract.37\n\nLaw No. 1993-44, Official register No. 364, published 29 November 1993 at art. 1, **CEX-42**.\n\nLetter from President Duran Ballen to the President of the National Congress, enclosing bill modifying the Hydrocarbons Law, 29 October 1993, at 2-4, **CEX-25**.\n\n58.\n\nThe desire on the part of Ecuador to transform the service contracts was part of a broader scheme to make foreign investment in its hydrocarbons industry more attractive. In addition to the change in the Hydrocarbons Law, Ecuador passed the Investment Promotion and Guarantee Law on 19 December 1997\u2014also known as Law 46\u2014the stated objective of which was to \"promote national and foreign investment and regulate the rights and obligations of the investors so that they may effectively contribute to the economic and social development of the country.\"38 These and other steps were taken by Ecuador with the aim of creating a legal and regulatory environment attractive to foreign investors in the hydrocarbon and other sectors.\n\nLaw No. 46, Official Register No. 219, published 19 December 1997, **CEX-22**.\n\n59.\n\nIn the same vein, Ecuador also amended its Constitution to provide a stable and reliable legal framework for the promotion of foreign investment in all economic activities, which, *inter alia*, guaranteed that foreign investment would be afforded the same treatment as national investment.39\n\nPolitical Constitution of the Republic of Ecuador, published 11 August 1998, **CEX-23**, in particular, Articles 244 and 271.\n\n60.\n\nIn an official letter dated 20 August 1996, Petroecuador gave notice to the Consortium of its decision to modify the Block 16 Service Contract into a participation contract.40 In a document dated 22 August 1996, the Consortium agreed to modify the Block 16 Service Contract and the Parties agreed to agree upon the terms and conditions of the new contract.41\n\nRenegotiating Committee Report, p. 3, **CEX-35**.\n\nRenegotiating Committee Report, p. 3, **CEX-35**.\n\n61.\n\nAlso on 22 August 1996, the Executive President of Petroecuador appointed a committee in charge of renegotiating the Block 16 Service Contract. The committee conducted a detailed analysis of the consequences of modifying the Block 16 Service Contract into a participation contract. The results of its analysis were recorded in a report entitled \"Report from the Negotiating Commission to Modify the Service Contract for Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons into a Production Sharing Contract for Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons in Block 16\" (\" **Renegotiating Committee Report** \").42 One of the Committee's conclusions was:\n\nSince the State's production sharing under the modified contracts does not depend from Contractor's costs and investments but, rather, from the level of production, the State obtains an assured production sharing percentage of 19.3% under these contracts. This does not exist in the current contracts because the State runs practically all the risk.43\n\nRenegotiating Committee Report, **CEX-35**.\n\nRenegotiating Committee Report, Conclusion 6, p. 20 of PDF, **CEX-35**.\n\n62.\n\nThe Government and the Consortium also considered whether to continue with the joint exploitation of the Bogi-Capiron reservoirs with Block 16 or to transfer those operations to Ecuador. The Committee concluded that it would be better to continue with the joint exploitation of the reservoir because a transfer to the State would entail greater risks for the State.44\n\nRenegotiating Committee Report, Conclusion 4, p. 20 of PDF, **CEX-35**.\n\n63.\n\nFrom 22 August to 24 October 1996, the Consortium and Ecuador negotiated the conversion of the Block 16 Service Contract to a participation contract.45 According to Respondent, during negotiations\u2014and given the requirement that a contract modification could only be recommended by the Government negotiators if it was in the interest of the State\u2014negotiators had to pursue terms that would provide the State with at least the 15% margin that it expected to receive under the Block 16 Service Contract.46\n\nRenegotiating Committee Report, **CEX-35** ; Annex V of the Participation Contract (Report of the Negotiation Commission, 1.9), **REX-61** ; Participation Contract, Supporting Document C (Minutes of the Commitment Executed by the Parties for the Modification of the Service Contract into this Contract), **CEX-36**.\n\nFirst Larrea Witness Statement, para. 17.\n\n***D. The Participation Contract***\n-----------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nOn 27 December 1996, the Consortium and Petroecuador agreed upon the modification of the Block 16 Service Contract to a participation contract by executing the Modification of the Service Contract into a Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block 16 of the Amazon Region of Ecuador (\" **Participation Contract** \").47 It was to last until 31 January 2012.48\n\nModification of the Service Contract into a Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block 16 between Empressa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador) and the Consortium Comprising YPF Ecuador Inc., Overseas Petroleum and Investment Corporation, Nomeco Ecuador Oil LDC, Murphy Ecuador Oil Company, and Canam Offshore Limited (27 December 1996), **CEX-36**.\n\nParticipation Contract, cl. 6.2, **CEX-36**.\n\n65.\n\nThe Participation Contract ensured that the Consortium members enjoyed full rights of ownership over their share in production.49 Clause 4.2 of the Participation Contract stated:\n\nThe Contractor shall have the exclusive right to perform, at its own cost and risk, the exploitation activities of Crude Oil and additional exploration in the Contract Area, investing capital and utilizing personnel, equipment, machinery and technology needed for its exact fulfilment, and in exchange the Contractor shall receive, as participation, a percentage of the Controlled Production.50\n\nParticipation Contract, cls. 3.3.5, 10.1-10.3, **CEX-36**. *See also* Presentation on the Seventh Bidding Round for Exploration and Production of Hydrocarbons in Ecuador-Calgary-Tokyo-Seoul, January 1994, London-Paris, January 1994, at 7, **CEX-39** (Claimant submits that in that presentation, Ecuador promoted the participation contract scheme, emphasising the right of ownership on contractors' participation). *See also* Statement of Clam, paras. 104-106 where Claimant refers to, *inter alia*, Decree No. 1417, Official Gazette No. 364, 21 January 1994, art. 9, **CEX-20** ; 1983 Ecuadorian Political Constitution, Art. 48, **CEX-40** ; 1998 Political Constitution of Ecuador Art. 30, **CEX-23** ; and Ecuadorian Civil Code Arts. 594, 600, **CEX-41**.\n\nParticipation Contract, cl. 4.2, **CEX-36**.\n\n66.\n\nThe Participation Contract also set parameters to calculate the parties' respective participation shares.

These parameters were to be included in the calculation formula of the respective shares:\n\n**BLOCK 16:**\n\nL1 = 20,000 barrels per day L2 = 40,000 barrels per day\n\nX1 = 84.74%\n\nX2 = 77.00%\n\nX3 = 60.00%\n\n**BOGI-CAPIRON:**\n\nL1 = 5,000 barrels per day L2 = 15,000 barrels per day\n\nX1 = 82.00%\n\nX2 = 73.50%\n\nX3 = 62.00%51\n\nRenegotiating Committee Report, p. 4 of PDF, **CEX-35**.\n\n67.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the price of oil was not a variable included in the calculation formula; rather, its participation share was to be based only on the number of barrels produced per day.52 Claimant submits that one of the main goals of the conversion to the Participation Contract was to allocate to the Consortium the risk of fluctuations in the global price of oil: if the price of oil was excessively low, the Consortium had no right to claim that it was not able to recoup its investment. By the same logic, if the price of oil was high, the Government had no right to claim that the Consortium's share of the profits was too high.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 81.\n\n68.\n\nClause 8.1 of the Participation Contract contained the formula for calculating the parties' respective participation shares. It set forth a decreasing percentage of the Consortium's participation when the daily production exceeded the thresholds of 20,000 barrels per day and 40,000 barrels per day. Accordingly, Ecuador's participation increased proportionately when the Consortium's participation decreased.53 Clause 8.1 provided as follows:\n\n8.1. **Calculation of Contractor's Production Sharing** : Contractor's Production Sharing shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n\nPC = X Q/100\n\nWhere:\n\nPC = Contractor's Production Sharing.\n\nQ = Fiscalized Production.\n\nX = Average factor, as a percentage rounded up to the third decimal point, corresponding to Contractor's Production Sharing. This is calculated in accordance with the following formula:\n\nX = X1 q1 + X2 q2 + X3 q3/q\n\nWhere:\n\nq = Average daily Fiscalized Production for the corresponding Fiscal Year\n\nq1 = Portion of q lower than L1\n\nq2 = Portion of q between L1 and L2\n\nq3 = Portion of q greater than L\n\nParameters L1, L2, X1, X2, and X3 are the following:\n\nL1 = 20,000 Barrels per day L2 = 40,000 Barrels per day\n\nX1 = 84.74%\n\nX2 = 77.00%\n\nX3 = 60.00%\n\nThe State's Production Sharing cannot be less than 12.5% if the Fiscalized Production (q) does not reach 20,000 Barrels per day. Production sharing shall increase to a minimum of 14% if the daily production is between 20,000 and 40,000 Barrels, and shall not be less than 18.5% if production exceeds 40,000 Barrels per day.\n\nIn consequence, Contractor's Production Sharing may in no case exceed the limits of 87.5%, 86%, and 81.5%, respectively.\n\nIn order to determine The State's Production Sharing and Contractor's Production Sharing, \"Q\" shall be estimated in advance by the Parties every quarter. In order to determine the definitive State's Production Sharing and Contractor's Production Sharing, the actual values corresponding to the Fiscalized Production and API degrees for the relevant Fiscal Year shall be used. The X factor shall be estimated during the first ten (10) days of the corresponding Quarter on the basis of the daily Fiscalized Production and its quality during the immediately preceding Quarter. Upon commencing Fiscalized Production, and while it is not possible to estimate and apply the X factor according to the above procedure, Contractor's Production Sharing shall be assumed to be equal to X2. In order to calculate the definitive X factor, Fiscalized Production and quality shall be used according to their actual values for the relevant year or fraction thereof and shall be settled during the first Quarter of the Fiscal Year next following.\n\nParticipation Contract, cl. 8.1, **CEX-36**. With regard to the production in the Bogi-Capiron field, the thresholds are different, taking into account the different size of that field compared to Block 16. The thresholds are set in the amounts of 5,000 and 15,000 barrels per day. *See* Bogi-Capiron Contract, cl. 9.3, **CEX-37**.\n\n69.\n\nClause 8.2 of the Participation Contract provides that:\n\nThe Participation of the Contractor, calculated on the basis of the sales price, which in no event shall be lower than the Reference Price, plus any other income that the Contractor's activities may receive in relation to this Contract, shall be the gross income of the Contractor under this Contract; from that gross income, [Contractor] shall make any deductions and shall pay income tax, in accordance with Clauses 11.1 and 11.2.54\n\nParticipation Contract, cl. 8.1, **CEX-36**.\n\n70.\n\nClause 8.5 of the Participation Contract provides the formula for calculating the State's participation:\n\nPE = (100 - X)Q/100\n\n71.\n\nAfter determining the Consortium's participation, which was deducted from total production, the remaining portion of crude oil was then delivered to the Government.55\n\nParticipation Contract, cl. 8.5, **CEX-36** ; Statement of Claim, para. 97.\n\n72.\n\nClaimant relies on the Hydrocarbons Law and Decree No. 1417 as affirming that the only relevant factor for assessing its participation was the amount of oil produced:\n\nThe contractor, once production has begun, shall have the right to a participation in the production of the contract area, which will be calculated on the basis of the offered percentages and agreed-upon in the contract, taking into account the volume of produced hydrocarbons. This participation, valued on the basis of the price sales of the hydrocarbons of the contract area, which in no event shall be lower than the reference price, shall constitute the gross income of the contractor from which it shall make any and shall pay the income tax, in accordance with the regulations of the Internal Tax Regime Act.56\n\nParticipations: Upon commencement of hydrocarbon production, to be measured at the inspection and delivery center, contractor shall be entitled to its participation in the production of the contract area, which shall be calculated using the formula established in the conditions of contract, on the basis of the percentages therein agreed upon of the hydrocarbons produced. In any case the State, through PETROECUADOR, shall receive its participation at the inspection and delivery center, where it shall be measured and calculated using the formula established in the conditions of contract.57\n\nHydrocarbons Law art. added after art. 12 by means of Law No.1993-44, **CEX-21** (Claimant's emphasis).\n\nDecree No. 1417, Official Gazette No. 364, 21 January 1994, art. 9, **CEX-20** (Claimant's emphasis).\n\n73.\n\nAccording to Claimant, all parties involved in the negotiation of the Participation Contract were sophisticated actors, who were aware that the exclusion of the price of oil as a factor in the participation formula was deliberate.58 This is demonstrated, Claimant alleges, by the fact that some of the same negotiators concluded a participation contract over the Tarapoa field, which contained a price-variable mechanism entitling the Government to increase profits in the event the price of oil exceeded a certain amount.59\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 125\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 126-128 *referring to* Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) by and between PETROECUADOR and City Investing Company Limited, executed on 25 July 1995, second cl. (1), **CEX-46**.\n\n74.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the price of oil was an integral part of the formula for calculating the parties' shares in participation.60 It submits that the basic reference price parameter\u2014known as the \"uniform price\" and equalling USD 15.26 per barrel\u2014was imbedded in the determination of the X1, X2, and X3 factors.61 It is included as a basic parameter in the Report of the Negotiating Commission, which is part of Annex V of the Participation Contract.62 Clause 3.3.9 of the Participation Contract defines the Participation Contract as: \"this instrument, including its annexes and exhibits, which jointly are denominated \u2018Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block (16).'\"63\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 55-58.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 55-56; First Larrea Witness Statement, para. 18; First Paredes Witness Statement, para. 7.\n\nAnnex V of the Participation Contract (Technical-Economical Analysis Report for the modification of the Service Contract of Block 16), **REX-61**.\n\nParticipation Contract, cl. 3.3.9, **CEX-36**. *See also* Annex V of the Participation Contract (Report Of the Negotiation Commission for Modification of the Block 16 Service Contract, the Specific Services Contract for Tivacuno, and the Bogi-Capiron Unitized Operating Agreement), **REX-61**.\n\n75.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the parties also agreed upon the following investment rates of return (\" **IRR** \") during the execution of the Participation Contract:64\n\n**Expected IRR NPV (15%)**\n\n*% M$*\n\nBlock 16 5.37% (138.40)\n\nBogi-Capiron 1.20% (30.80)\n\nTivacuno N/A (14.80)\n\n**Total (184.00)**\n\nExpert Report of Anton Melard de Feuardent, Fair Links (4 May 2014) (\" **First Fair Links Report** \"), para. 75.\n\n76.\n\nOn the same day that the Participation Contract was concluded, the Consortium and Petroproduccion also executed new contracts relating to the Bogi-Capiron Common Reservoirs and the Tivacuno Area.65 With respect to the latter, the Specific Services Contract was not converted into a participation contract. The modified contract, however, incorporated an economic formula similar to that found in the Participation Contract.66 While the Consortium assumed similar risks of exploration, it acquired no ownership rights to a share of the production.67 The Consortium's fees were calculated as a percentage of the value of the oil produced in the contract area.68\n\nBogi-Capiron Contract, **CEX-37** ; Modification of the Specific Services Contract for the Development and Production of Crude Oil in the Tivacuno Area between Petroecuador and the Consortium composed of YPF Ecuador, Inc., Overseas Petroleum and Investment Corporation, Nomeco Ecuador LDC, Murphy Ecuador Oil Company and Canam OffShore Limited (27 December 1996), **CEX-121**.\n\nModified Tivacuno Contract, **CEX-128**.\n\nModified Tivacuno Contract, Clause 5, **CEX-128**.\n\nModified Tivacuno Contract, Clause 5, **CEX-128**.\n\n77.\n\nOn 10 January 2001, Repsol YPF Ecuador SA (\" **Repsol YPF** \") assumed the role of Consortium operator.69 It received its interest in the Consortium as follows: (a) on 31 January 1992, Conoco assigned 20% of its interest in the Consortium Agreement, which was annexed to the Block 16 Service Contract, to Maxus Ecuador Inc.;70 (b) in 1999, the Spanish group Repsol acquired YPF, the Argentinian State-owned oil company that owned Maxus Ecuador, Inc., and renamed Maxus Ecuador Inc. as YPF Ecuador, Inc.;71 and (c) on 18 January 2001, YPF Ecuador Inc. transferred its interest in the Consortium to the newly created Repsol YPF.72\n\nDeed of Assignment of Hydrocarbons Rights and Obligations executed by YPF Ecuador Inc. in favor of Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A.

The increase in global oil prices***\n------------------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nFrom the mid-1980s until the beginning of the 2000s, crude oil prices had remained stable at around USD 20/bbl. In early 2002, global prices for crude oil began to rise significantly. The upward trend continued steadily and in 2005 exceeded most projections to reach USD 60/bbl. In July 2006, oil prices reached a record high of USD 75/bbl.73\n\n*Babusiaux, et al.*, Oil and Gas Exploration and Production: Reserves, Costs, Contracts (2007), para. 1.2.7.1, **REX-88**.\n\n79.\n\nIn September 2005, Ecuador's President Palacio Gonzalez was reported as stating that the State wished to reorganise the participating contracts to \"achieve a 50% share for the country.\"74 In the same report, the former Minister of Energy, Fernando Santos, was reported as stating that \"all contracts must be respected because they have the effect of law for the parties, but they may be amended by mutual consent.\"75\n\n\"Ecuador Will Modify Petroleum Contracts\", DIARIO HOI, 8 September 2005, **CEX-148**.\n\n\"Ecuador Will Modify Petroleum Contracts\", DIARIO HOI, 8 September 2005, **CEX-148**.\n\n80.\n\nOn 1 March 2006, President Gonzalez presented to Congress a bill to amend the Hydrocarbons Law.76 The bill was then sent for review by the Commission on Economic, Agricultural, Industrial and Commercial Matters (\" **EAIC Commission** \") within the Ecuadorian Congress.77 The EAIC Commission prepared a report on the bill, which was submitted to the Congress for debate, in which it raised several concerns regarding the bill's constitutionality:\n\nThe bill, as proposed by the President of the Republic, would contain some constitutional violations against the stability of contracts executed in good faith and the legal certainty, therefore, as expressed by the majority of Representatives during the first debate, the bill must be reformulated and adjusted to constitutional provisions. [...]\n\nIt is indispensable to respect the constitutional guarantee of investments and contracts [\u2026]78\n\nOfficial Letter from President Gonzalez to Chairman of the National Congress, 1 March 2006, **CEX-150**.\n\nNational Congress of Ecuador, Records of Second Debate, Minute No. 25-227, 29 March 2006, p. 5, **CEX-48**.\n\n*See* National Congress of Ecuador, Records of Second Debate, Minute No. 25-227, 29 March 2006, **CEX-48**. Claimant submits that the minority of the Commission proposed an alternative that required the consent of the oil companies to amend existing contracts, which was in line with constitutional and legal principles under Ecuadorian law (Statement of Claim, footnote 169).\n\n81.\n\nIn the same session of the parliamentary debate, one of the representatives also warned about the risks that Ecuador could face if the bill was passed as it had been proposed by the Executive Branch, in violation of the rule of law:\n\n[A] very important aspect that we need to consider is that Argentina, which modified contracts unilaterally, is now facing claims in an amount of US$17 billion. That is exactly what will happen to us, Ecuadorians, if contracts are modified unilaterally or by means of a law; we are going to get a flood of international claims, and the amounts of future judgments against us will be catastrophic.79\n\nExcerpt of the address of representative Carlos Torres Torres to the plenary of the Ecuadorian Congress, in the second session of parliamentary debate of Law 42. *See* National Congress of Ecuador, Records of Second Debate, Minute No. 25-227, 29 March 2006, **CEX-48**.\n\n***F. The enactment of Law 42 and the issuance of Decree No. 1672 (\"Law 42 at 50%\")***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nOn 29 March 2006, the Ecuadorian Congress passed Law 42.80 It took effect on 25 April 2006. Law 42 applied to all investors holding participation contracts. It amended Article 44 of the Hydrocarbons Law so as to entitle the State to receive from oil companies with participation contracts what was described as \"participation in the surplus of oil sale prices\".81\n\nLaw No. 42, Official Gazette No. 257 (Supplement) (25 April 2006), **CEX-47**.\n\nHydrocarbons Law, art. 44, as amended, **CEX-47**.\n\n83.\n\nLaw 42 also amended Article 55 of the Hydrocarbons Law, thereby granting the State a participation of at least 50% of the \"extraordinary income\" arising from the price difference between the then prevailing oil price and the oil price prevailing at the date the participation contracts were concluded, multiplied by the number of oil barrels:\n\nState's participation in the surplus of oil sale prices, which have not been agreed upon or foreseen.\u2014Contractor companies that have current participation contracts with the State for hydrocarbon exploration and exploitation, notwithstanding their crude oil participation volumes, when the monthly average FOB Ecuadorian crude oil sale price exceeds the monthly average FOB sale price prevailing as of the date of execution of their contracts, stated at constant prices as of the month of payment, shall grant the Ecuadorian State a participation of at least 50% of the extraordinary income arising from the price difference. For purposes of this Article, extraordinary income shall be understood to mean the above described price difference multiplied by the number of oil barrels. The price of crude oil as of the date of the contract used as a reference for the calculation of the difference shall be adjusted based on the United States Consumer Price Index published by the Central Bank of Ecuador.82\n\nHydrocarbons Law, art. 55, as amended, **CEX-47**.\n\n84.\n\nOn 13 July 2006, President Gonzalez issued Decree No. 1672, which set the \"additional participation\" at a minimum of 50%. Section 2 of Decree No. 1672 stated:\n\nThe State right to the surplus resulting from oil sale prices not agreed upon or established in the participation Contracts for Hydrocarbon Exploration and Crude Oil Exploitation entered into with the State of Ecuador through PETROECUADOR shall amount to a minimum of 50% of extraordinary income resulting from the difference between the monthly weighted average effective [FOB] sale price of Ecuadorian oil by the contractor and the weighted average monthly sale price on the date following execution of the above-mentioned Participation Contracts, times the number of barrels produced by each contractor, pursuant to the provisions set out in section 4 of these Replacing Regulations.83\n\nDecree No. 1672, Official Gazette No. 312 (Supplement) (13 July 2006), **CEX-104**.\n\n85.\n\nJust before Law 42 came into effect, Canam assigned its entire interest in the Consortium to Murphy Ecuador.84 As of this date, therefore, Murphy Ecuador held a 20% interest in the Consortium.\n\nDeed of Assignment of Hydrocarbons Rights and Obligations executed by Canam Offshore Limited in favor of Murphy Ecuador Oil Company Limited (18 April 2006), registered in the Hydrocarbons Registry of the National Board of Hydrocarbons on 18 May 2006, **CEX-122**.\n\n86.\n\nIn May 2006, two claims were filed with Ecuador's Constitutional Tribunal challenging the constitutionality of Law 42.85 On 22 August 2006, the Constitutional Tribunal of Ecuador issued a consolidated decision (\" **Joint Resolution** \") upholding the constitutionality of Law 42.86\n\nCase number 0008-06-TC was brought by citizen Mauricio Pinto Mancheno, on his own behalf and on behalf of the Chamber of Industrials of Pichincha and a thousand citizens, and Case Number 0010-06-TC was brought by citizen Juan Carlos Mejia Mediavilla, acting on his own behalf and as a representative for another thousand citizens.\n\nConstitutional Tribunal Resolution No. 0008-06-TC and 0010-06-TC, published in *Official Gazette* No. 350 (Supplement) (6 September 2006), **CEX-50**.\n\n***G. The issuance of Decree No. 662 (\"Law 42 at 99%\")***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nOn 18 October 2007, the new President, Rafael Correa, issued Decree No. 662 under Law 42, which increased the \"additional participation\" to a minimum of 99%:\n\nTo issue the following Reform to the Regulation of Application of the Law N\u00b0 42.2006 which reforms the Hydrocarbons Law.\n\nArt. 1.- In article 2 instead of \"50%\" it shall say \"99%\".87\n\nDecree No. 662, Official Gazette No. 193 (18 October 2007), CEX-126 (bold font omitted).\n\n88.\n\nPetroecuador started demanding payments under Law 42 from the Consortium members in 2006.88 From May 2006 to October 2007, the Consortium made payments pursuant to Law 42 and Decree No. 1672, according to which the \"additional participation\" was set at 50%.

This applied to all participation contracts, new or modified, entered into from 1 January 2008 onwards. The 70% tax would apply when the oil price exceeded a reference price on which Petroecuador and the contractor were to agree. Once such an agreement had been reached, Law 42 ceased to apply to the affected contract. Many oil companies signed modification contracts in mid- to late-2008 with increased reference prices which had the effect of narrowing what constituted \"extraordinary income\".\n\n*Ley Reformatoria para la Equidad Tributaria*, published in *Official Gazette* No. 242 (Supplement) (29 December 2007), Article 170, **CEX-108**.

Among the various scenarios mentioned was the sale by Murphy Ecuador of its shareholding in Block 16 to Repsol YPF. The memorandum stated the following:\n\nMurphy has been in negotiations to sell its interest in Block 16/Tivacuno to Repsol. The verbally agreed price is $80 million, with Murphy also keeping its $83 million of unpaid Law 42 tax. An agreement has been drafted, but neither party has signed the agreement at this time. Murphy's board has been presented with the progress of this negotiation, and if officially offered by Repsol has given tentative approval to sell the field under these terms. The government of Ecuador has tentatively approved the ownership transfer, but final authorization is pending the agreement of the remaining owners to amend the contract as noted above, stop furtherance of the arbitration proceedings, and possibly meeting other demands such as payment of interest on unpaid Law 42 liabilities. Additionally, the government is insisting that the new contract only allow most issues, including tax and fiscal matters, to be brought before either Ecuadorian courts or a regional arbitration tribunal based in Latin America. In order to sell our interest to Repsol, the operator must obtain an agreeable contract renegotiation with the government, which will include settlement of past Law 42 payments.\n\n[...]\n\nConclusion: Based on the information available, and primarily based on the expectation that a sale to Repsol will occur at a price that will recover our investment, and that our Law 42 liability exceeds our net book value, I conclude that we are probable of recovering our investment in Block 16/Tivacuno.115\n\nME Memo Dec. 2008, page 00186, **REX-137**.\n\nME Memo Dec. 2008, page 00186, **REX-137**.\n\n105.\n\nOn 19 February 2009, Petroecuador initiated what is known as a *coactiva* proceeding against the Consortium. This is a process under which certain Ecuadorian agencies, of which Petroecuador is one, enjoy the authority to collect monies in an expedited summary proceeding.116 The defendant in a *coactiva* proceeding is required to pay the amount claimed before filing any defense, and to do so within a period of three days.117 On 19 February 2009, Petroecuador's Chief of Unit of Finance Administration issued a title of credit and a writ of payment confirming that the Consortium owed Petroecuador USD 444,731,349.00.118 Petroecuador issued a second writ of payment on 20 February 2009 and a third writ of payment on 25 February 2009 for the same amount.119 As a result, Claimant and Repsol sought immediate provisional measures before their respective ICSID Tribunals.120\n\nThe Code of Civil Procedure of Ecuador regulates the so-called *coactiva* jurisdiction. *See* Code of Civil Procedure of Ecuador art. 941 *et seq.*, **CEX-84**. *See also* Law No. 45 (*Ley Especial de la Empresa Estatal de Petroleos del Ecuador-PETROECUADOR-y sus Empresas Filiales),* Official Gazette No. 283, 26 September 1989, **CEX-27**.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 198.\n\nPetroecuador's Coactivas Court, Quito, **CEX-85** ; Notification of Coactiva Procedure (19 February 2009), **REX-104**.\n\nSecond writ of payment (20 February 2009), **REX-105** ; Third writ of payment (25 February 2009), **REX-107**.\n\nRepsol's Request for Arbitration and Provisional Measures, **REX-25** ; *Murphy* ICSID Award, para. 6, **CEX-3**.\n\n106.\n\nFaced with the imminent threat of seizure of its assets, Repsol tried to reach an agreement with Ecuador. The Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, in an official visit to Ecuador, mediated between Repsol and the Government in an attempt to avoid the unilateral termination of the Participation Contract and to find a mutually satisfactory solution to the dispute.121\n\n\"Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs Advocated for Repsol\" (\"Canciller espanol cabildeo por Repsol\"), El Universo, 26 February 2009, **CEX-151**.\n\n107.\n\nBefore any overdue Law 42 amounts were collected from the Consortium, Ecuador and Repsol YPF reached an oral agreement to move forward with the signing of contractual arrangements, and the *coactiva* proceedings were suspended.122 According to Claimant, the preliminary verbal agreement reached on 25 February 2009 required a number of prerequisites to be resolved in a short amount of time.123 Murphy Ecuador did not agree with the proposed terms. Although the Consortium members other than Murphy Ecuador had earlier signed the *acta* (or letter of intent) with the government on 6 November 2008, the Participation Contract could not be amended without Murphy Ecuador's express consent.124 This impasse necessitated the buying out by Repsol of Murphy Ecuador's interest in the Consortium.125\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 203; Respondent's Letter to Arbitral Tribunal, February 25, 2009.

JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n123.\n\nRespondent has raised a number of jurisdictional objections in these proceedings. Early on in the case, Respondent argued that by Claimant's earlier election of ICSID arbitration, Claimant had exhausted all opportunity afforded to it under Article VI of the Treaty to arbitrate its claims. That objection was dismissed by a majority of this Tribunal in the Partial Award on Jurisdiction dated 13 November 2013. Respondent has also pleaded that Claimant's claims should be precluded because they are really those of its former shareholder Murphy Ecuador. That issue is addressed in Section VIII of this Award. Respondent has also objected to Claimant's claim under the so-called \"umbrella\" clause of the Treaty. In light of this Tribunal's finding on the merits, it is not necessary for this Tribunal to address that issue.\n\n124.\n\nRespondent's remaining jurisdictional objection to be addressed by the Tribunal is based on Article X of the Treaty.\n\n125.\n\nArticle X provides:\n\n(1) With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the other Party.\n\n(2) Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI and VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;\n\n(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment Agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VI(1)(a) or (b), to the extent they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable period of time.\n\n***A. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nRespondent claims that Law 42 is a \"matter of taxation\" for the purposes of Article X of the Treaty.150 Therefore, with the exception of Claimant's claim for expropriation, all of Claimant's claims that Ecuador breached its obligations under the Treaty are excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction.151 None of the other exceptions to the tax carve-out clause of Article X apply. The Participation Contract does not constitute an investment agreement because Murphy Ecuador is a Bermudan entity, not a U.S. entity.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, paras. 127-128. *See also* paras. 169, 171, 174-175, 177-178; Statement of Defence and Reply on Jurisdiction, section IV; Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 51, *referring to* *EnCana v.

Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n141.\n\nClaimant argues that Article X applies only when \"matters of taxation\" are involved in the dispute, and given that Law 42 is not a tax\u2014either under Ecuadorian or international law\u2014it cannot be considered a \"matter of taxation\" for the purposes of Article X of the BIT.201 As such, Claimant's claims are not excluded from the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 189-190.\n\n142.\n\nClaimant argues that under Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the BIT must be interpreted \"in accordance with the ordinary meaning\" of its terms, and, absent a specific definition in the BIT, the term \"matters of taxation\" cannot be expanded to cover matters that do not fall within the respective tax regimes of the Contracting States.202 As Law 42 was enacted outside the scope of the Ecuadorian tax regime, it cannot be considered a tax under any other purportedly applicable law.203 Murphy argues that the BIT should be interpreted \"in the light of its object and purpose\", which is the promotion and protection of covered investments.204 Any concerns to protect the State's power to raise revenues through taxation cannot override the clear terms of the BIT.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 198; Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 375.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 198.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 199, 201, *citing* VCLT, Article 31(1); Claimant's Closing Statement, Slides 123-125 (citations omitted).\n\n143.\n\nClaimant claims that the *EnCana*, *Duke Energy*, *Occidental II* and *Burlington* cases are distinguishable and do not support Respondent's case.\n\n144.\n\nFirst, Claimant clarifies that *EnCana* was brought under the Canada-Ecuador BIT, not the US-Ecuador BIT.205 The dispute was whether VAT refunds were excluded by the tax carve-out. While the Canada-Ecuador BIT does not define \"taxation measures,\" it does define \"measures\" as \"any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice.\"206 In light of the broad definition of \"measures\", the *EnCana* tribunal held that there was no reason to limit the tax carve out to \"actual provisions of the law which impose a tax\" but that it should also include \"all those aspects of the tax regime which go to determine how much tax is payable or refundable\".207 The tribunal found that the term \"taxation\" included indirect taxes such as VAT.208 The tribunal also stated that \"a measure is a taxation measure if it is part of the regime for the imposition of a tax.\"209 Given that the measure in dispute in *EnCana* was part of the Ecuadorian tax regime, Murphy argues that *EnCana* does not support the argument that the term \"taxation\" should be interpreted as including laws that are not part of the Ecuadorian tax regime.210\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 207, *referring to* *EnCana* Award, para. 167 n. 119, **CLA-79** ;

It is also what the *Duke Energy* tribunal did when it found that the exemption from customs duties was instituted by law and thus part of the taxation legislation.222 These two tribunals did not resort to international law, or any other legislation apart from Ecuadorian law, to make those determinations.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 231-232, *referring to* Statement of Claim, paras. 218, 227-229, *Robert Jennings and Arthur Watts (eds.)*, OPPENHEIM'S INTERNATIONAL LAW, Vol. 1, 9th edition (1996), p. 83 **CLA-7** ; Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 359.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 233, 234-237, *referring to EnCana* Award, paras. 142(3), 142(4), **CLA-79** ; *Duke Energy* Award, para. 175, **CLA-22** ; *El Paso Energy International v.

That is belied, Claimant says, by the fact that Law 42 is still in force today.233\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 239.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 240.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 239, *referring to* Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 162.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 239, *referring to Ley Reformatoria para la Equidad Tributaria*, published in *Official Gazette* No. 242 (Supplement) (29 December 2007), Chapter II, **CEX-108**.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 239, *referring to Ley Reformatoria para la Equidad Tributaria*, published in *Official Gazette* No. 242 (Supplement) (29 December 2007), **CEX-108** ; Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 397.\n\n152.\n\nFurther, Claimant submits that the enactment of Law 42 as a purported \"urgent economic measure\" has no bearing on whether or not it is a tax.234\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 395.\n\n153.\n\nEven if Law 42 were a tax, Claimant submits that Article X(2) is only triggered if Claimant's claims \"raise\" \"matters of taxation\".235 For that to be the case, Ecuador argues that Murphy's claims must \"relate to the legality of Law 42 under the Treaty.\"236 Claimant says that it does not contest Law 42 *per se* and its claims do not challenge the enactment of Law 42,237 or Law 42's status under Ecuadorian or international law, or Ecuador's taxation powers.238 Rather, Claimant avers that it is challenging the *application* or *enforcement* of Law 42 to the Participation Contract.239 Specifically, Claimant submits that Ecuador's enforcement of Law 42 violated the guarantees and protections provided for in the Participation Contract, including the following:\n\n[the] exclusive ownership of the Consortium's participation (Clause 3.3.5) and its right to sell it at market prices (Clause 10.1); the specific formula agreed-to by the Parties, which deliberately excludes the price of oil from the calculation of each Party's respective share, which is based exclusively on production volumes (Clause 8.1 through 8.5); the legal stability set forth in Clause 22.1 in accordance with Article 7.18 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code; the prohibition against unilateral modification provided for in Clause 15.2; and, subsidiarily and in the alternative, the need to preserve the economic stability of the contract provided for in Clauses 8.6 and 11.11.240\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 402.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 257.\n\nHowever, note that Claimant argues that it is the *enforcement* of Law 42 that violated the Treaty's standards and caused it injury.

Analysis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nArticle X of the Treaty provides in its entirety:\n\n(1) With respect to its tax policies, each Party should strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investment of nationals and companies of the other Party.\n\n(2) Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI and VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:\n\n(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;\n\n(b) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or\n\n(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment Agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VI(1)(a) or (b), to the extent they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable period of time.246\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 128, *referring to* US-Ecuador BIT, Article X(2), **CEX-1**.\n\n157.\n\nArticle X is a tax carve-out clause similar to many found in bilateral investment treaties. It excludes from international supervision the Contracting States' powers to legislate taxes. The question before this Tribunal is whether Law 42 is properly considered a \"matter of taxation\" under Article X of the Treaty. If it is, this Tribunal would not have jurisdiction over Claimant's claims, unless one of the three exceptions in Article X(2) were to apply. The main point of difference between the Parties is the extent to which the domestic characterisation of Law 42\u2014 *i.e.*, that it is a change to the Hydrocarbons Law, not a tax law\u2014should be taken into account when deciding whether Law 42 is a \"matter of taxation\" for the purposes of Article X of the Treaty. Claimant says Law 42's domestic characterisation is relevant; Respondent says it is not.\n\n158.\n\nThe Treaty does not define \"matters of taxation\" or \"taxation\". As it is an instrument of international law, the term must be interpreted in accordance with international law. Article 31(1) of the VCLT provides that: \"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\" Article 31(1) contains separate principles that are to be applied simultaneously: interpretation in good faith; recourse to the ordinary meaning; and that the ordinary meaning is not to be determined in the abstract but in context and in light of the treaty's object and purpose.247\n\n*Villiger*, COMMENTARY ON THE 1969 VIENNA CONVENTION ON THE LAW OF TREATIES (2009), pp. 425-428 (\" ***Villiger*** \"); *Arthur Watts (ed.)*, THE INTERNATIONAL LAW COMMISSION 1949-1998:, Vol. Two: The Treaties, Part 2, Commentary to Art. 27 (2010), p. 687; *Dorr and Schmalenbach (eds),* Vienna CONVENTION ON THE Law OF Treaties: A Commentary (2012), p. 541 *referring to* Final Draft Commentary to Art. 27, 221, para. 12 (\" ***Dorr and Schmalenbach*** \").\n\nOrdinary Meaning\n----------------\n\n159.\n\nTurning first to the ordinary meaning, the Tribunal notes that both Parties accept the observation made by the *EnCana* tribunal that a \"taxation law\" is one which imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes. It is also uncontested that \"tax\" ordinarily means a mandatory levy imposed by the government for public purposes, without any direct benefit to the taxpayer. The latter definition identifies an additional element that there is no direct benefit to the taxpayer, which this Tribunal accepts as part of the ordinary meaning. Considering the essential elements of a tax as identified by the Parties and other tribunals, this Tribunal considers that the ordinary meaning of a \"matter of taxation\" is a matter related to the imposition of a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes and without any direct benefit to the taxpayer.\n\nContext of the Treaty\n---------------------\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal turns next to the context by reference to which the term \"matters of taxation\" must be interpreted. \"Context\" includes the other terms of Article X as well as the remainder of the Treaty.248\n\nVilliger, p. 427; Dorr and Schmalenbach, p. 543.\n\n161.\n\nThe first clause in Article X exhorts each Contracting State, *with respect to its tax policies*, to strive to accord fairness and equity in the treatment of investments of nationals and companies of the other State. Following this exhortation is the provision excluding matters of taxation from the dispute settlement clauses of the Treaty. The Tribunal determines that the reference to the Contracting States' \"tax policies\" in Article X(1) is pertinent to the question of whether the domestic characterisation of a measure should be considered in the interpretation of the term \"matters of taxation\". Article X(1) provides context in reference to which Article X(2) should be interpreted. A State's domestic tax regime is the manifestation of its tax policies. When the Tribunal interprets the term \"matters of taxation\" under Article X(2), it should therefore take into account the domestic tax regime that is the legislative and regulatory manifestation of its tax policies. Even though the domestic characterisation of a law is not decisive in the treaty context, it is a strong indication as to how the law should be characterized. A tribunal would be remiss if, in interpreting Article X(2) of the Treaty, it paid no regard to the characterisation of the measure under the domestic tax regime.\n\n162.\n\nThe final paragraph of Article X refers to a \"Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties.\" The commentary in the U.S. Submittal Letter states that \"tax matters\" are generally excluded from the coverage of the prototype BIT based on the assumption that \"tax matters\" are properly covered in bilateral tax treaties. This suggests that the content of bilateral tax treaties informs the interpretation of \"matters of taxation\". It also states that \"two of the three expropriatory taxation and tax provisions contained in an investment agreement or authorization are not typically addressed in tax treaties.\" This suggests that there are \"taxation and tax provisions\" that are not typically covered by bilateral tax treaties but that could be considered \"matters of taxation\" under the Treaty.\n\n163.\n\nEcuador and the U.S. have not concluded a bilateral tax treaty. The Parties agree that most bilateral tax treaties typically cover matters of double taxation or tax evasion. Whereas Claimant submits that bilateral tax treaties are generally limited to these discrete categories of tax matters,249 Respondent argues that while they often include a list of specific tax laws, those lists are not exhaustive, and more general measures related to taxes on income and capital are also covered.250\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 88-89.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 71.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the reference in Article X to a bilateral tax treaty is inconclusive in terms of assisting in the interpretation of \"matters of taxation\". Bilateral tax treaties typically concern issues of double taxation and fiscal evasion. However, other matters exist that may be considered taxation matters but that are not covered by bilateral tax treaties.\n\nObject and Purpose of the Treaty\n--------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nFinally the Tribunal turns to the object and purpose of the Treaty, as relevant to the interpretation of \"matters of taxation\". The object and purpose of the Treaty as a whole is to promote greater economic cooperation between the parties and investment by nationals of one party in the territory of the other.251 The purpose of Article X specifically is to preserve the States' sovereignty in relation to their power to impose taxes in their territory. Most governments view these powers as a central element of sovereignty. Therefore, while they may be willing to accept international discipline over State conduct, they are reluctant to accept such oversight as regards their powers of taxation. This has led most State parties to modern investment treaties to omit taxation from a treaty's ambit, or restrict the treaty's application to certain types of taxes.252\n\nUS-Ecuador Treaty, Preamble, **CEX-1**.\n\n*Abba Kolo*, Tax \"Veto\" as a Special Jurisdictional and Substantive Issue in Investor-State Arbitration: Need for Reassessment?, 32 SUFFOLK TRANSAT'L L. REV. 475, 475 (2009), **RLA-33** ; Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 138.\n\n166.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, for it to assess whether a measure is one which was meant to be excluded from an international arbitral tribunal's purview because it concerns a State's sovereign power of taxation, it is necessary for the Tribunal to examine whether that measure comes within the State's domestic tax regime.\n\n167.\n\nThe Parties agree that Law 42 was not enacted under Ecuadorian tax legislation.253 Rather, it was an amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law.254 Law 42 was promulgated under Article 155 of the Ecuadorian Constitution which provides the President with powers to submit emergency draft legislation regarding economic matters to Congress, at which point the draft laws must be approved, modified, or tabled within 30 days of submission to the legislative branch, or pass as is. Law 42 reformed the Hydrocarbons Law by changing and inserting standards into it. Article 1 substituted Article 44 and Article 2 inserted an unnumbered article after Article 55.255 By contrast, Article 147 of the Ecuadorian Constitution applies to the creation, modification, or removal of tax laws. It stipulates that only the President can submit draft tax laws to Congress.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 161; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 143.\n\nCordero Expert Report, April 2014, paras. 12-13.\n\nSee *supra* para. 83. Article 44 of the Hydrocarbons Law was amended so as to entitle the State to receive from oil companies with participation contracts what was described as \"participation in the surplus of oil sale prices\". Law 42 also amended Article 55 of the Hydrocarbons Law, thereby granting the State a participation of at least 50% of the \"extraordinary income\" arising from the price difference between the then prevailing oil price and the oil price prevailing at the date the participation contracts were concluded, multiplied by the number of oil barrels.\n\n168.\n\nAt the time of Law 42's enactment, high-ranking government officials said that it was not a tax. The then-current Attorney General, Dr. Jose Maria Borja Gallegos, stated before Ecuador's Constitutional Tribunal on 12 July 2006 that:\n\n[t]o state that \u2018All the elements of a tax can be found without difficulties in Art. 2 of [Law 42]' is absolutely irrational [...]. In this case it is very clear that [Law 42] is not a tax law, not only because it lacks a tax law's constitutive elements, but also because given its character as a law amending a principal law, it receives the same treatment as the latter, and the Hydrocarbons Law is not in any way a tax law.\"256\n\nConstitutional Tribunal Case Docket No. 0008-2006-TC, pp. 39-40, **CEX-231**.\n\n169.\n\nThe current Attorney General of Ecuador, Dr. Diego Garda Carrion, also stated before Ecuador's Constitutional Tribunal on 12 July 2006 that Law 42 \"is not a Tax Law, neither does it create nor does it modify any tax or tribute\".257\n\nConstitutional Tribunal Case Docket No. 0008-2006-TC, p. 18, **CEX-231**.\n\n170.\n\nThat Law 42 did not come within the Ecuadorian tax regime is further demonstrated by the difference between its enactment and that of the *Ley de Equidad Tributaria*. The latter was enacted in accordance with a chapter of the Ecuadorian Tax Code and formed part of a wider reform of Ecuador's national tax system.258 It states explicitly that it \"creates\" a \"tax on extraordinary income\", also known as the \"Windfall Income Tax\".259\n\n*Ley Reformatoria para la Equidad Tributaria*, published in *Official Gazette* No. 242 (Supplement) (29 December 2007), **CEX-108** ; Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 162; Response to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 239; Cordero Expert Report, April 2014, paras. 36-39.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 239, *referring to Ley Reformatoria para la Equidad Tributaria*, published in *Official Gazette* No. 242 (Supplement) (29 December 2007), Chapter II, **CEX-108**.\n\n171.\n\nThe Parties have referred to the findings of several tribunals established under investment treaties that have examined whether legal measures taken by Ecuador, including Law 42, ought properly to be considered tax measures under Ecuadorian law and/or international law.\n\n172.\n\nOne of these cases is the *EnCana* case, commenced in March 2003 pursuant to the Canada-Ecuador BIT. Article XII(1) of that treaty provides that \"nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation measures.\" While the treaty does not define taxation or taxation measures, it does contain a broad definition of the word \"measure\" as including \"any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice\".\n\n173.\n\nThe *EnCana* case concerned claims for VAT refunds arising out of contracts for the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas reserves in Ecuador.260 The claimant impugned measures taken by Ecuadorian tax authorities that sought to deny tax credits and refunds to oil companies.261 The respondent argued that the claim was inextricably associated with a \"taxation measure\" and therefore excluded from the scope of the BIT's dispute settlement provisions (except for expropriation).262 The tribunal agreed.\n\n*EnCana* Award, para. 23, **CLA-79**.\n\n*EnCana* Award, para. 23, **CLA-79**.\n\n*EnCana* Award, para. 133, **CLA-79**.\n\n174.\n\nThe tribunal held that the term \"taxation measures\" should be given its normal meaning in the context of the treaty. It made the following observations:\n\n(1) It is in the nature of a tax that it is imposed by law. [...] The Tribunal is not a court of appeal in Ecuadorian tax matters, and provided a matter is sufficiently clearly connected to a taxation law or regulation (or to a procedure, requirement or practice of the taxation authorities in apparent reliance on such a law or regulation), then its legality is for the courts of the host State.\n\n(2) There is no reason to limit the term \"taxation\" to direct taxation. [\u2026] Thus indirect taxes such as VAT are included.\n\n(3) Having regard to the breadth of the defined term \"measure\", there is no reason to limit Article XII(1) to the actual provisions of the law which impose a tax. All those aspects of the tax regime which go to determine how much tax is payable or refundable are part of the notion of \"taxation measures\". Thus tax deductions, allowances or rebates are caught by the term.\n\n(4) The question whether something is a tax measure is primarily a question of its legal operation, not its economic effect. A taxation law is one which imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes. The economic impacts or effects of tax measures may be unclear and debatable; nonetheless a measure is a taxation measure if it is part of the regime for the imposition of a tax. [\u2026]263\n\n*EnCana* Award, paras. 141-142, **CLA-79**.\n\n175.\n\nWhen the *EnCana* tribunal interpreted the tax carve-out provision of the Canada-Ecuador BIT, it examined Ecuador's domestic legal tax regime.264 It was clear from that analysis that, unlike Law 42, the impugned measures in *EnCana* were part of the Ecuadorian tax regime. The question before the *EnCana* tribunal was whether the term \"taxation measures\" was broad enough to include indirect taxes. There was no dispute that the measures were enacted within the tax regime; demands were made on the claimant by tax officials.265 The tribunal held that \"all those aspects of the tax regime which go to determine how much tax is payable or refundable are part of the notion of \u2018taxation measures'\". There is thus a significant difference between the issue before the *EnCana* tribunal and the question before this Tribunal. This Tribunal must assess whether a measure is a matter of taxation under Article X notwithstanding that it was not enacted as a tax or otherwise part of the national tax regime.\n\n*EnCana* Award, paras. 146-150, **CLA-79**.\n\n*EnCana* Award, paras. 41-57, 146, **CLA-79**.\n\n176.\n\nThe *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador* (\" ***Occidental I*** \")266 and *Duke Energy* cases also involved measures that were enacted within the Ecuadorian tax regime. *Occidental I* involved the same measures as *EnCana\u2014* VAT reimbursements *\u2014* and *Duke Energy* involved exemptions from customs duties.267 These cases are therefore of limited assistance given that, unlike the measures at issue in them, Law 42 was enacted outside of the Ecuadorian tax regime. What is notable, however, is that in both of these cases, as in *EnCana*, the tribunals examined the domestic tax regime when assessing whether the measure fell within the treaty's tax carve-out provision.\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador*, LCIA Case No. UN 3467.\n\n*Duke Energy* Award, paras. 173-175, **CLA-22** ; *Occidental I* Award, para. 37(b), **CLA-21**.\n\n177.\n\nThe *Burlington* tribunal was the first to determine whether Law 42 constituted a \"matter of taxation\" under Article X(2) of the US-Ecuador Treaty. The tribunal was of the view\u2014and the parties had presupposed the same view\u2014that there could be \"matters of taxation\" under Article X only if there was a tax within the meaning of that provision.268 Accordingly, the tribunal examined whether Law 42 was a tax for the purposes of Article X of the Treaty. In its Decision on Jurisdiction of 2 June 2010, the tribunal held that the question whether Law 42 constituted a tax for the purposes of Article X of the Treaty was a question of international law, not Ecuadorian law:\n\n[\u2026] the question whether Law 42 is a tax for purposes of Article X is governed by international law, not by Ecuadorian law.\n\nTherefore, for the purposes of jurisdiction, the Tribunal needs only to decide whether Law 42 is a tax for purposes of Article X of the Treaty under international law. In other words, there is no point in the tribunal determining at this stage whether Law 42 is a tax under Ecuadorian law.269\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 159, **RLA-8**.\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 162-163, **RLA-8**.\n\n178.\n\nThe *Burlington* tribunal applied the tax definition in *EnCana* and *Duke Energy*, *i.e*., that the measure constitutes a tax if the following four requirements are met: (1) there is a law; (2) that imposes liability on classes of persons; (3) to pay money to the State; (4) for public purposes.270 The tribunal held that under this definition, Law 42 constituted a tax for the purposes of Article X of the Treaty.271 It then examined whether Burlington's claims \"raised\" matters of taxation within the meaning of the Treaty. The parties had agreed that a dispute \"raises \u2018matters of taxation' whenever an investor challenges the validity or enforcement of a tax.\"272 The tribunal concluded that some of the claimant's claims challenged the validity or enforcement of Law 42 and were thus excluded from the tribunal's jurisdiction, whereas other claims did not and thus came within the tribunal's jurisdiction.273\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 165, **RLA-8**.\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 165-166, **RLA-8**.\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 168, **RLA-8**.\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 177, 178-216, **RLA-8**.\n\n179.\n\nThe *Occidental II* tribunal constituted under the U.S.-Ecuador Treaty assessed whether Law 42 was properly characterized as a tax. It asked whether Law 42 was: \"a tax, a royalty, a levy or, more generally, a \u2018matter of taxation' under the Treaty, or [\u2026] something else?\".274\n\n*Occidental II* Award, para. 487, **CLA-117**.\n\n180.\n\nThe *Occidental II* tribunal noted that at the quantum hearing, Ecuador had for the first time argued that Law 42 was a \"matter of taxation\" for the purposes of Article X of the Treaty. At the same hearing, Ecuador had also stated that Law 42 was not a tax:\n\n488. There is also a compelling procedural reason why the Tribunal must characterize Law 42. At the Hearing on Quantum, the Respondent, for the first time in these proceedings, claimed that \"the question of Law 42 is excluded from the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction in accordance with Article 10 of [the] Treaty\". In effect, as will be seen, the Respondent was now adopting the position that Law 42 was a \"matter of taxation.\"\n\n489. The Tribunal recalls that the Respondent, throughout the Hearing on Quantum, was loath to characterize Law 42. In its Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent stated categorically that Law 42 was not a royalty.\n\n490. The Tribunal also recalls that at the Hearing on Quantum, the Respondent submitted categorically that Law 42 \"is not a tax\". In the words of counsel for Ecuador:\n\n\"[I]n Ecuador [\u2026] for a tax to be created and imposed on the citizens, you need to follow some special procedures in the constitution. Here, this Law 42 was issued pursuant to a different procedure. So it couldn't be a tax.\"\n\n181.\n\nThe *Occidental II* tribunal held that Law 42 was not a tax:\n\n495. The Tribunal [\u2026] agrees with the Respondent that Law 42 is not a tax. Again, such a characterization is contrary to the plain text of Law 42 and, in any event, as stressed by the Respondent, it was not \"created\" in accordance with the Ecuadorian Constitution.\n\n182.\n\nThe tribunal characterized Law 42 rather as \"a unilateral decision of the Ecuadorian Congress to allocate to the Ecuadorian State a defined percentage of the revenues earned by contractor companies such as OEPC that hold participation contract[s].\"275 While it is clear that the *Occidental II* tribunal did not consider Law 42 to be tax under Ecuadorian law, the tribunal did not explicitly state whether it considered Law 42 to be a \"matter of taxation\" under the Treaty. It found that the claimant fell within the Article X(2)(c) \"investment agreement\" exception to the Treaty's tax carve-out.\n\n*Occidental II* Award, para. 510, **CLA-117**.\n\n183.\n\nBy contrast, the tribunal in *Perenco Ecuador Limited v. The Republic of Ecuador* (\" ***Perenco*** \"),276 constituted under the France-Ecuador BIT, held that Law 42 was a tax under Ecuadorian law (and thus triggered the taxation modification clauses of the underlying contracts). That tribunal held that while the evidence went both ways, on balance, and having regard to \"its economic effect, the fact that it mandated the payment of monies to the State in accordance with a specified formula, and Perenco's contemporaneous characterization of Law 42 as a tax to which the taxation modification clauses of the Contracts applied, the Tribunal consider[ed] that Law 42 should be treated as a taxation measure.\"277\n\n*Perenco Ecuador Limited v. The Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/6.\n\n*Perenco* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, paras. 376-377.\n\n184.\n\nOne element that weighed in favour of the tribunal's conclusion in this case was the fact that the claimant Perenco Ecuador Limited had characterized Law 42 as a tax at the time it was enacted. That element is not present in this case. Neither Murphy, Murphy Ecuador, nor the other Consortium members contemporaneously characterized Law 42 as a tax. To the contrary, they believed that Law 42 was not a tax at the time it was enacted which is why, at the time, they did not invoke clauses 8.6 (economic stability) or 11.11 (modification of the tax regime and the labour profit sharing) of the Participation Contract.278\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 145.\n\n185.\n\nFor the reasons set forth at paragraphs 167 to 170 above, this Tribunal concludes that Law 42 did not constitute a tax under Ecuadorian law. The Tribunal is of the view that while the domestic characterisation of a measure is not determinative at international law, it provides a strong indication of the measure's proper characterisation.\n\n186.\n\nRespondent has argued that notwithstanding that Law 42 was not enacted as tax legislation *per se*, it carried all of the conceptual characteristics of a tax, *i.e.*, it required (1) payment of money unilaterally required by the State; (2) in order to obtain resources and for public expenditures; (3) in exercise of the State's absolute power required, even under compulsion; (4) by virtue of the law.279 It contends that it should thus be considered a \"matter of taxation\" for the purposes of the Treaty.\n\nCordero Expert Report, April 2014, paras. 17, 19-22.\n\n187.\n\nRespondent relies on the guidelines for the definition of \"tax\" given by the *EnCana* tribunal, *i.e.*, a measure that imposes a liability on classes of persons to pay money to the State for public purposes. It argues that Law 42 satisfies the *EnCana* test because it instituted a fixed levy\u2014called \"additional participation\"\u2014on the extraordinary income generated by oil sales.280 The additional participation was compulsory and applied to a select group of persons.281 It was collected on a mandatory basis and entered Ecuador's treasury.282 Its purpose was to \"promote public welfare by allowing the Republic [\u2026] to provide its people with the benefit of the unprecedented increase in oil prices.\"283\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, paras. 155-156.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 156.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 156.\n\nObjections to Jurisdiction, para. 158.\n\n188.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that notwithstanding that Law 42 was clearly enacted outside of the Ecuadorian tax regime, it is necessary to examine whether it may nevertheless be considered a matter of taxation at international law for the purposes of Article X(2). In order to assess this, the Tribunal shall examine its legal operation.284\n\n*EnCana* Award, para. 142(4), **CLA-79**.\n\n189.\n\nLaw 42 operated similarly to a tax in that it imposed economic burdens (50% and later 99% of additional participation) upon a class of persons (contractors with participation contracts for oil exploration and exploitation in Ecuador) to pay money to the State, ostensibly for public purposes (to allocate a larger share in revenues derived from the country's natural resources to its citizens via State expenditure) without there being any direct benefit to the taxpayer. Law 42 and the subsequent *Ley de Equidad Tributaria* had similar effects.\n\n190.\n\nNotwithstanding these similarities, the Tribunal holds that, taking into account all circumstances, the more accurate characterisation of Law 42's operation is that it was not a tax, or a matter of taxation at international law, but a unilateral change by the State to the terms of the participation contracts that were governed by the Hydrocarbons Law.285 The stated purpose of the law was to amend certain oil contracts held by certain oil companies, all of which were foreign companies.286 The obligation to pay 50% in additional participation stemmed from the contractual obligations in the participation contracts. The revenue earned by the State under Law 42 was classified as nontax revenue.287 After the enforcement of Law 42, Ecuador's \"non-tax\" revenue from hydrocarbon exploitation increased, while the contractors' decreased, essentially modifying the participation formula in the contracts.\n\n*See supra*, para. 182. This was also the conclusion reached by the tribunal in *Occidental II* Award, paras. 509 and 525, **CLA-117** :  \n \"509. For purposes of characterizing Law 42, it is sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude, as it now does, that the participation of Ecuador under Law 42 \u2018in surplus from oil sales prices not agreed upon or not foreseen,' is neither a royalty, a tax, a levy or any other measure of taxation under the Participation Contract.  \n [\u2026]  \n 525. [\u2026] the Tribunal finds that with the introduction of Law 42, the Respondent modified unilaterally and in a substantial way the contractual and legal framework that existed at the time the Claimants negotiated and agreed the Participation Contract and thereby violated Clauses 5.3.2 and 8.1 of the Participation Contract.\"\n\n*See* Loose Expert Report I, p. 4, para. (n).\n\n*See* Neira Expert Report, para. 49; Loose Expert Report II, paras. 59-64.\n\n191.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that not every mandatory payment made by a class of persons to the State for public purposes without direct benefit is necessarily a tax. For example, certain types of fines, fees, or special contributions may be required payments to the government but not constitute a tax.288\n\nV. Thuronyi, COMPARATIVE TAX LAW, pp. 45-54 (2003), **RLA-133**.\n\n192.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that Law 42 does not constitute a \"matter of taxation\" for the purposes of Article X(2) of the Treaty so as to preclude this Tribunal's jurisdiction over Claimant's non-expropriation claims.\n\n**VII. MERITS**\n---------------\n\n193.\n\nClaimant claims that Ecuador has breached (1) the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty; (2) the so-called \"umbrella\" clause found at Article II(3)(c); (3) the obligation of full protection and security at Article II(3)(a); (4) the obligation of non-impairment through arbitrary measures found at Article II(3)(b); and (5) the provision against unlawful expropriation at Article III(1) of the Treaty.\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal turns first to Claimant's claim for breach of the FET standard in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty.\n\n1. **Whether the fair and equitable treatment standard under the Treaty exceeds the scope of the customary international law minimum standard**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n195.\n\nClaimant argues that Respondent violated the FET standard under Article II(3)(a) of the BIT, which states that \"[i]nvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law\".289\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 231, *referring to* Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, **CEX-1**.\n\n196.\n\nClaimant states that the FET standard requires a host State to: (1) \"protect and observe an investor's legitimate expectations;\" (2) \"ensure the stability and predictability of the legal and business framework;\" (3) \"act consistently and transparently towards the investor and its investment;\" and (4) \"act in good faith and treat the investor and its investment free from coercion and harassment\".290 Claimant argues that Respondent has breached each of these requirements.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 540; Statement of Claim, paras. 243-244, *referring to* *CMS Gas Transmission Corporation v.

Analysis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe Parties dispute the extent to which Article II(3)(a) of the BIT represents an autonomous treaty standard that is distinct from the standard established under customary international law.\n\n206.\n\nThis debate is more theoretical than substantial. It is clear from the repeated reference to \"fair and equitable\" treatment in investment treaties and arbitral awards that the FET treaty standard is now generally accepted as reflecting recognisable components, such as: transparency, consistency, stability, predictability, conduct in good faith and the fulfilment of an investor's legitimate expectations.306 The precise application of these components, and the stringency of the standard applicable, may vary from case to case depending on the terms of the clause and the specific circumstances of the case. Notwithstanding, the function of the FET clause in investment treaties is broadly the same: it ensures the stability and predictability of the legal and business framework in the State party subject to any qualifications otherwise established by the treaty and under international law.307 Moreover, as articulated by the *Occidental I* tribunal, also referring to the US-Ecuador BIT, the treaty's FET standard \"is an objective requirement that does not depend on whether the Respondent has proceeded in good faith or not\".308\n\n*See e.g. Waste Management* Award, para. 98, **CLA-11/RLA-406** ; *Tecmed* Award, para. 154, **CLA-6/RLA-157**.\n\n*Occidental I*, Award, para. 183, **CLA-21** ; *Duke Energy* Award, para. 339, **CLA-22** ; *LG&E* Decision on Liability, para. 1135, **CLA-30** ; *CMS* Award, paras. 274-279, **CLA-20/RLA-165**.\n\n*Occidental I* Award, para. 188, **CLA-21**. *See also* *CMS* Award, para. 280, **CLA-20/RLA-165** ; *Duke Energy* Award, para. 341, **CLA-22** ; *Azurix* Award, para. 372, **CLA-10** ; *Siemens* Award, paras. 299, 300, **CLA-12**.\n\n207.\n\nProtecting the stability and predictability of the host State's legal and business framework also underpins the modern customary international law standard.309 The *CMS Gas Transmission Corporation v. Argentine Republic*310 tribunal, for example, decided that \"the Treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment and its connection with the required stability and predictability of the business environment, founded on solemn legal and contractual commitments, is not different from the international law minimum standard and its evolution under customary law.\"311 Other tribunals interpreting the customary international law obligation have repeatedly embraced a less stringent standard and have emphasised that they were dealing with an evolving concept that embraces the application and interpretation of the treaty FET standard.312 The *Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America*313 tribunal interpreted the Free Trade Commission statement regarding the content and standard of Article 1105 of NAFTA as \"incorporating current international law, whose content is shaped by the conclusions of more than two thousand bilateral investment treaties and many treaties of friendship and commerce. Those treaties largely and concordantly provide for \u2018fair and equitable' treatment of, and for \u2018full protection and security' for, the foreign investor and his investments\".314 The *ADF Group Inc. v. United States of America*315 tribunal, affirming the observations made in *Mondev*, stated further that the constantly evolving international standard \"must be disciplined by being based upon State practice and judicial or arbitral caselaw or other sources of customary or general international law\".316\n\n*Tecmed* Award, paras. 153-155, **CLA-6/RLA-157** ; *Duke Energy* Award, para. 339, **CLA-22** ; *LG&E* Decision on Liability, para. 1135, **CLA-30**.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Corporation v.

United States of America*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1 (\" **ADF** \").\n\n*ADF Group* Award, para. 184, **RLA-293**.\n\n208.\n\nThe international minimum standard and the treaty standard continue to influence each other,317 and, in the view of the Tribunal, these standards are increasingly aligned. This view is reflected in the *jurisprudence constante* not only of NAFTA caselaw, as discussed above, but also in the arbitral caselaw associated with bilateral investment treaties.318 Some tribunals have gone so far as to say that the standards are essentially the same.319 The Tribunal finds that there is no material difference between the customary international law standard and the FET standard under the present BIT. Certainly, the FET standard of the BIT is not lower than the international minimum standard. The Tribunal does not find it necessary to determine for the purposes of the present case whether the FET standard reflects an autonomous standard above the customary international law standard.\n\n*Mondev* Award, para.117, **CLA-19** :\n\n\"Investment treaties run between North and South, East and West, and between States in these spheres *inter se*. On a remarkably widespread basis, States have repeatedly obliged themselves to accord foreign investment such treatment. In the Tribunal's view, such a body of concordant practice will necessarily have influenced the content of rules governing the treatment of foreign investment in current international law. It would be surprising if this practice and the vast number of provisions it reflects were to be interpreted as meaning no more than the *Neer* Tribunal (in a very different context) meant in 1927.\"\n\n*See e.g.* *Tecmed* Award, paras. 153-155, **CLA-6/RLA-157** ; *Duke Energy* Award, para. 333, **CLA-22** ; *CMS* Award, para. 284, **CLA-20/RLA-165** ; *Azurix* Award, para. 361, **CLA-10**.\n\n*Duke Energy* Award, para. 337, **CLA-22** ; *Occidental I* Award, para. 190, **CLA-21** ; *Rumeli* Award, para. 611, **CLA-23**.\n\n2. **Whether Ecuador violated Claimant's legitimate expectations**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A.

The legal framework on which the investor is entitled to rely consists of the host State's international law obligations, its domestic legislation and regulations, as well as the contractual arrangements concluded between the investor and the State.396 Specific representations or undertakings made by the State to an investor also play an important role in creating legitimate expectations on the part of the investor but they are not necessary for legitimate expectations to exist.397 An investor may hold legitimate expectations based on an objective assessment of the legal framework absent specific representations or promises made by the State to the investor.\n\n*Duke Energy* Award, **CLA-22** ; *Occidental I* Award, **CLA-21** ; *Rumeli* Award, **CLA-23** ; *Biwater* Award, **CLA-** **24** ; *Eureko* Award, **CLA-33**.\n\n*Metalclad* Award, paras. 29-30, **CLA-41** ; *CMS* Award, paras. 275, 281, **CLA-20/RLA-165** ; *LG&E* Decision on Liability, para. 133, **CLA-30** ; *Enron* Award, para. 41, **CLA-14** ; *Sempra* Award, paras. 148, 158, **CLA-35** ; *BG Group* Award, para. 307, **CLA-25** ; *National Grid* Award, paras. 59-60, **RLA-340** ; *See also* *Micula* Award, paras. 502-535, **RLA-395**.\n\n249.\n\nAn investor's legitimate expectations are grounded in the legal framework as it existed at the time that the investment was made.398 Accordingly, the Tribunal must make an objective assessment of Murphy's legitimate expectations at the time that it made its investment in Ecuador, taking into consideration all of the relevant circumstances.399\n\n*Schreuer and Kriebaum*, At What Time Must Legitimate Expectations Exist? in: Werner and Ali (eds.), A Liber Amicorum: Thomas Walde.

When Claimant entered into the Participation Contract in January 1997, the nature of its investment changed in a fundamental way; it gained the right to a share in oil production. Under the new contract, it bore exploration, development and production costs, and thus, inherently, the risk of low oil prices. It also stood to gain from an increase in oil prices through sales of its share in production. Given the significantly different legal framework that existed at the time of Claimant's original investment in the Block 16 Service Contract and its subsequent investment in the Participation Contract, the Tribunal finds that it is relevant to assess Claimant's legitimate expectations as of 1997. Indeed, this is how the Parties have pleaded the case.\n\nThe International and Domestic Legal Framework Underpinning Claimant's Legitimate Expectations\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nIn view of the poor results Ecuador had experienced under the services contracts concluded in the mid-1980s, it sought to amend its legal regime so as to allow participation contracts under which investors and the State would share participation in oil production. This required an amendment to Ecuador's Hydrocarbons Law.\n\n253.\n\nWhen introducing the bill to amend the Hydrocarbons Law, the Ecuadorian President Duran Ballen issued the following statement to the President of the National Congress:\n\n[T]he limited financial resources that the country has [...] do not justify PETROECUADOR's assumption of all the risk involved in exploration activities; such risk must be shared with international petroleum companies.\n\n[...]\n\nThe Services Contract has become an extremely complex contract in terms of management and control, due to the relationship of dependency created among the various State agencies. Moreover, the provision for mandatory reimbursement of the contractor's investments, costs and expenses has significantly reduced the participation of the State in the economic benefits of oil exploration and production in medium and small fields.\n\nFinally, the Service Contract does not permit the contracting company to have a production flow of its own. This characteristic goes against the interest and *raison d'etre* of international oil companies, for the majority of whom the availability of production is an essential aspect of marketing in international markets.\n\nThe new proposed contract\u2014the participation contract\u2014will allow Ecuador to position itself at an internationally competitive level for attracting venture capital, because the contractor company, through the bidding process, shall set the economic conditions for the compensation for its investments. The State, in any case and whichever the production level, shall have priority to receive a share of the production of the area under the contract.401\n\nLetter from President Duran Ballen to the President of the National Congress, enclosing bill modifying the Hydrocarbons Law, 29 October 1993, at 2-4, **CEX-25**.\n\n254.\n\nOn 29 November 1993, the amendment to the Hydrocarbons Law (Law No. 44) was implemented through Decree 1417.402 The Decree introduced the production sharing contract-type to Ecuador's oil industry with the aim of obtaining \"greater technical and economic efficiency, for the benefit of the Government's interest.\" It contained a number of provisions designed to attract foreign investment, including (1) confirmation that contractors would be entitled to participation in oil production, calculated using formula established in the contracts; (2) an exemption from royalties; and (3) an economic stability clause ensuring that the participation in production would be readjusted to maintain the economics of the contract if the applicable tax regime was modified.403 Decree No. 1416, issued on 21 January 1994, provided the contractual bases upon which production sharing would be regulated.404 It also confirmed that under the participation contract scheme, contractors were delegated the right to explore and exploit hydrocarbons and to incur on their \"own account and risk all investments and costs and expenses required for exploration, development and production.\"405\n\nLaw No. 1993-44, Official register No. 364, published 29 November 1993 at art. 1, **CEX-42**.\n\nLaw No. 1993-44, Official register No. 364, published 29 November 1993 at the preamble and arts. 9 and 16, **CEX-42**.\n\nExecutive Decree 1416 (Reprivatization of the Hydrocarbon Industry) (21 January 1994), **CEX-146**.\n\nExecutive Decree 1416 (Reprivatization of the Hydrocarbon Industry) (21 January 1994), at art. 1, **CEX-146**.\n\n255.\n\nIn December 1993, the Law on the Modernization of the State was passed.406 It sought to modernise the public sector, encourage privatisation, and enhance public-private partnerships. The State undertook to delegate the exploration and exploitation of non-renewable natural resources owned by it to public-private partnerships or private entities, subject to the State's guarantee that such resources would be explored and exploited \"for the benefit of the nation.\"407\n\nLaw No. 1993-50, Official Register No. 349, published 13 December 1993, **CEX-24**.\n\nLaw No. 1993-50, Official Register No. 349, published 13 December 1993, at art. 6, **CEX-24**.\n\n256.\n\nAs part of the overhaul and modernisation of its hydrocarbons industry, Ecuador entered into 27 bilateral investment treaties, 19 of which were concluded in the 1990s.408 The US-Ecuador BIT was signed on 27 August 1993.409\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 64.\n\nUS-Ecuador Treaty, **CEX-1**.\n\n257.\n\nIt was within the context of this positive legal reform that the Consortium and Petroecuador entered into negotiations in mid-1996, with a view to transforming the Block 16 Service Contract into a participation contract. It is uncontested that both parties were represented during negotiations by highly-qualified executives and that the negotiations themselves were lengthy and detailed.410 Both parties believed that they would benefit from the conversion to a participation contract. Petroecuador, having reimbursed costs but having received little in the way of revenue for the preceding decade, considered that it would be better off shifting the responsibility of costs to the contractor, even if that meant relinquishing a share in production. The Consortium believed that it would benefit from a direct participation in oil production because that would enable it to profit from the upside of increased oil prices.411 According to Mr. DePauw (who worked for Murphy from 1982 to 2007, in management positions), that was one of the main reasons Murphy decided to stay in Ecuador:\n\nOne of the main reasons that Murphy decided to remain in Ecuador and convert to the production-sharing format was that we had envisaged that oil prices would in fact increase. We saw this as one of the main upsides to balance out the added risks that the Participation Contract entailed.412\n\n*Repsol YPF Ecuador, S.A v.

Through its legal reforms, it held itself out as being able to provide a modern, stable, and predictable legal and business framework that would operate for the mutual benefit of foreign investors and Ecuador.\n\nModification of the Service Contract into a Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block 16 between Empressa Estatal Petroleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador) and the Consortium Comprising YPF Ecuador Inc., Overseas Petroleum and Investment Corporation, Nomeco Ecuador Oil LDC, Murphy Ecuador Oil Company, and Canam Offshore Limited (27 December 1996), **CEX-36**.\n\n259.\n\nSignificant positive legal reforms continued after Claimant agreed to the Participation Contract. In December 1997, Ecuador passed the Investment Promotion and Guarantee Law in which it made many important undertakings.414 For example, Ecuador offered several guarantees, such as legal stability and government support to develop economically viable projects.415 It also declared the hydrocarbons sector a national priority.416 It awarded investors rights of ownership without limitation, except for those under laws in force.417 Ecuador undertook to ensure that its agencies and other public sector entities would respect constitutional guarantees.418 It also undertook to comply with its investment treaty obligations, and confirmed its consent to international arbitration in accordance with the investment treaties that it had signed.419\n\nLaw No. 46, Official Register No. 219, published 19 December 1997 (\" **Law No. 46** \"), **CEX-22**.\n\nLaw No. 46, arts. 17(i), 21, **CEX-22**.\n\nLaw No. 46, art. 2, **CEX-22**.\n\nLaw No. 46, art. 17(g), **CEX-22**.\n\nLaw No. 46, art. 21, **CEX-22**.\n\nLaw No. 46, preamble and arts. 2, 17, 21, 31 and 33, **CEX-22**.\n\n260.\n\nIn addition, in August 1998, Ecuador amended its Constitution. It further committed to provide a stable and reliable legal and institutional framework to promote the development of all economic activities.420 It also authorised Ecuador to include stabilisation clauses in contracts so that such contracts would not be affected by any future changes in the laws.421\n\nPolitical Constitution of Ecuador, 11 August 1998, at art. Article 244, **CEX-23**.\n\nPolitical Constitution of Ecuador, 11 August 1998, at art. Article 271, **CEX-23**.\n\nContractual Arrangements Underpinning Claimant's Legitimate Expectations\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal turns next to an examination of the contractual arrangements agreed by the Parties under the Participation Contract. The Tribunal confines its examination to those terms that it considers pertinent to its analysis of Claimant's legitimate expectations.\n\n262.\n\nOne fundamental point of difference between the Parties is whether, as argued by Respondent, the price of oil was a variable to be included in the calculation formula of clause 8.1 of the Participation Contract (which would generate a certain guaranteed rate of return), or whether, as argued by Claimant, Claimant's participation share was to be based on production volume alone.\n\n263.\n\nClause 8.1 sets out the formula by which Claimant's share of production was to be calculated. There is no mention of a price factor in clause 8.1 of the Participation Contract. Nor is there a reference to a rate of return. It appears from the text of clause 8.1 that the Contractor's participation was linked to volume of production:\n\n**8.1 Calculation of Contractor's Production Sharing:** Contractor's Production Sharing shall be calculated according to the following formula:\n\nPC = X Q/100\n\nWhere:\n\nPC = Contractor's Production Sharing.\n\nQ = Fiscalized Production.\n\nX = Average factor, as a percentage rounded up to the third decimal point, corresponding to Contractor's Production Sharing. This is calculated in accordance with the following formula:\n\nX = X1 q1 + X2 q2 + X3 q3/q\n\nWhere:\n\nq = Average daily Fiscalized Production for the corresponding Fiscal Year\n\nq1 = Portion of q lower than L1\n\nq2 = Portion of q between L1 and L2\n\nq3 = Portion of q greater than L2\n\nParameters L1, L2, X1, X2, and X3 are the following:\n\nL1 = 20,000 Barrels per day L2 = 40,000 Barrels per day\n\nX1 = 84.74%\n\nX2 = 77.00%\n\nX3 = 60.00%\n\nThe State's Production Sharing cannot be less than 12.5% if the Fiscalized Production (q) does not reach 20,000 Barrels per day. Production sharing shall increase to a minimum of 14% if the daily production is between 20,000 and 40,000 Barrels, and shall not be less than 18.5% if production exceeds 40,000 Barrels per day.\n\nIn consequence, Contractor's Production Sharing may in no case exceed the limits of 87.5%, 86%, and 81.5%, respectively.\n\nIn order to determine The State's Production Sharing and Contractor's Production Sharing, \"Q\" shall be estimated in advance by the Parties every quarter. In order to determine the definitive State's Production Sharing and Contractor's Production Sharing, the actual values corresponding to the Fiscalized Production and API degrees for the relevant Fiscal Year shall be used.\n\nThe X factor shall be estimated during the first ten (10) days of the corresponding Quarter on the basis of the daily Fiscalized Production and its quality during the immediately preceding Quarter. Upon commencing Fiscalized Production, and while it is not possible to estimate and apply the X factor according to the above procedure, Contractor's Production Sharing shall be assumed to be equal to X2. In order to calculate the definitive X factor, Fiscalized Production and quality shall be used according to their actual values for the relevant year or fraction thereof and shall be settled during the first Quarter of the Fiscal Year next following.\n\n264.\n\nRespondent argues that the Report of the Renegotiating Committee, annexed to the Participation Contract at Annex V,422 contains the mathematical equation upon which the parties negotiated the basis for calculating the Contractor's production share. Respondent points out that the crude oil price of USD 15.26 per barrel is listed as a basic parameter that was \"negotiated\" by Petroecuador's commission and the Consortium.423\n\nReport of the Renegotiating Committee, **CEX-35**.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 55.\n\n265.\n\nAnnex V is a copy of the Report of the Renegotiation Commission. It constitutes the results of an internal negotiation team's detailed analysis pertaining to the conversion of the Block 16 Service Contract to the Participation Contract.424 Specifically, the authors adopted economic parameters with which to analyse the projected benefits of such a conversion.425 One parameter that they had to estimate was the price of oil over the lifetime of the contract. They assumed a price of USD 15.26 per barrel, and, using that as one of several basic parameters, concluded that the conversion from the Service Contract to a participation contract would be in the State's economic interests.426 Indeed, the purpose of the analysis was to satisfy the State that the terms negotiated with the Consortium were in the State's interest.427 Given this background, it cannot be said that Annex V reflected an \"agreement\" between the parties to the Participation Contract that a reference price variable of USD 15.26 per barrel was to be included in the calculation formula of clause 8.1. While the Renegotiating Committee Report refers to those parameters as \"negotiated\", on the evidence before it, the Tribunal does not accept that Claimant agreed to the parameters adopted by Petroecuador's team.428 Rather, clause 8.1 reflects the factors agreed by the parties for the calculation of the Contractor's participation in production.\n\nReport of the Renegotiating Committee, **CEX-35**.\n\nReport of the Renegotiating Committee, Report on Technical-Economic Analysis, p. 1, **CEX-35**.\n\nReport of the Renegotiating Committee, Report on Technical-Economic Analysis, p. 1, **CEX-35**.\n\nReport of the Renegotiating Committee, Report on Technical-Economic Analysis, p. 1, **CEX-35**.\n\nDePauw Witness Statement, para. 26.\n\n266.\n\nThe Tribunal is not persuaded otherwise by Respondent's reference to clause 3.3.9 of the Participation Contract which reads: \"This instrument, including its supporting documents and exhibits, which shall as a whole be called \u2018Production Sharing Contract for Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) in Block No. 16.\"429 While the Tribunal accepts that this clause incorporated all supporting documents and exhibits into the Participation Contract, it does not mean that the contents of each document reflected an agreement of the parties, particularly when some of the documents, on their face, were prepared by one side only.\n\nParticipation Contract, **CEX-36**.\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal also notes that, in contrast to the present case, Petroecuador *did* negotiate mechanisms to address price variations in other contracts.430 For example, in July 1995, Ecuador concluded a participation contract over the Tarapoa Area. That contract was premised on the same participation formula as that in clause 8.1 of the Participation Contract, except that at the end of clause 8.1, the Tarapoa contract said:\n\nIf the price of crude oil in the Block exceeds USD 17 per barrel, the surplus of the benefit brought about by the price increase in real terms [\u2026] will be distributed between the Parties in equal shares.431\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 97-98 *referring to* the Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 246, n. 317.\n\nParticipation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of Hydrocarbons (Crude Oil) by and between Petroecuador and City Investing Company Limited, executed on 25 July 1995, second cl. (1), **CEX-46**.\n\n268.\n\nThe parties to the Tarapoa Contract expressly factored in the price of oil. Had the parties to the Participation Contract truly agreed on such a significant term, that term would have been reflected clearly in the contractual documents as it was in the Tarapoa Contract. Given that the negotiation teams for both sides were sophisticated and experienced actors in the oil industry, the Tribunal does not accept that the reference to USD 15.26 as a \"basic parameter\" in Annex V indicates that the parties had agreed that the price of oil would be a factor for the calculation of the Contractor's production share.\n\n269.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the *Burlington* and *Occidental II* tribunals reached the same conclusion with respect to the formula for the calculation of the contractor's production share (which is the same formula as in this case) and the reference to a price of oil in an annex V to the underlying contracts (where those annexes also comprised reports of the renegotiating committee):\n\nAnnex V was not intended to set out the terms of the prospective [Participation Contract], but merely to establish whether it would be in Ecuador's interest to enter into a [Participation Contract] in lieu of a service contract from an economic standpoint.432\n\nIt is clear to the Tribunal that, in the Participation Contract, the Claimants knowingly accepted the risk of losses on its investment in case of a low price scenario and the Respondent knowingly forewent the opportunity to increase its participation in case of a high price scenario. This was the bargain which was struck by the parties and which was reflected in the Participation Contract.433\n\n*Burlington* Decision on Liability, para. 285, **CLA-233**.\n\n*Occidental II* Award, para. 522, **CLA-117**.\n\n270.\n\nUnder clause 10 of the Participation Contract, Claimant had the right to \"freely dispose of the Crude Oil that corresponds to it,\" subject to domestic supply needs.434 Clause 10.2 guaranteed Claimant the right to market its production share on the domestic or international markets, and Article 10.3 of the Contract guaranteed Claimant the full value of its share of production.435\n\nParticipation Contract, cl. 10.1, **CEX-36**.\n\nParticipation Contract, cls. 10.2 and 10.3, **CEX-36**.\n\n271.\n\nIn addition, clause 15.2 of the Participation Contract provided that it would be possible to modify the contracts upon the prior agreement of the parties. The contracts could not be modified unilaterally.\n\n272.\n\nAs stated by the tribunal in *Perenco* :\n\nIn cases where a contract exists between the investor and the host State, the terms of the contract and the State's legislation in relation thereto, assume particular significance in the analysis.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nWhere a State has duly considered a legislative/regulatory policy, as was the case in 1994 when Ecuador resolved that it was in the nation's interest to move from service to participation contracts, governmental decisions taken thereafter must, during the lifetime of such contractual arrangements maintain fidelity to that policy framework. This is not to say that the policy framework is frozen and cannot be changed because this is not so unless the State has expressly stabilised its law vis-a-vis its contractual counterparty. But [...] any changes to the policy framework must still be made mindful of the State's contractual commitments.\n\nThe Participation Contracts were anchored in a legislative framework duly considered and enacted by the Nation's Congress. That framework and its rationale set out certain key features of the new contractual regime which were then reflected in the contracts subsequently concluded with oil companies. Consequently, any contractor could reasonably expect that the contracts' structure would not be altered by Petroecuador unilaterally or undone by subsequent State action external to the contract except in accordance with their terms and the State's law.436\n\n*Perenco* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, paras. 561-563, **CLA-329**.\n\nConclusion on Claimant's Legitimate Expectations\n------------------------------------------------\n\n273.\n\nConsidering both the terms of the Participation Contract and the legal framework that was in place in Ecuador at the time that Claimant signed up to the Participation Contract, the Tribunal finds that the Consortium members held legitimate expectations that the terms of the Participation Contract would not change except within the confines of the law and pursuant to a negotiated mutual agreement between the contractual partners. The State had committed to maintaining a contractual business relationship with the Consortium according to the terms of the Participation Contract set within a stable and predictable legal and business framework. What those guarantees meant in practical terms for the Contractor was that the price of crude oil would *not* be factored into the calculation of its participation share in the contract. As such, Claimant would assume the risk of any decrease in the price of crude oil as well as the benefit of any increase, in exchange for assuming the risk of its exploration activities.437 Claimant would then enjoy the principal benefit obtained by its decision to convert the Block 16 Service Contract into the Participation Contract, which was entitlement to full ownership of a percentage of its production through participation.438\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 246.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 264.\n\n274.\n\nClaimant has alleged that Respondent's enactment of Law 42 along with its implementing decrees breached the Treaty's FET standard. The Tribunal shall now consider the enactment of Law 42 and Decree No. 1672.\n\nWhether Law 42 at 50% Breached Claimant's Legitimate Expectations\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nLaw 42 stipulated that the State would be entitled to receive \"participation in the surplus of oil sale prices\". It clarified that \"the surplus of oil sale prices\" meant the \"extraordinary income\" arising from the price difference between the then-prevailing oil price and the oil price prevailing at the date the participation contracts were concluded, multiplied by the number of oil barrels. The minimum percentage of participation of the State in the extraordinary income would be 50%.439 Decree No. 1672 set the additional participation at the minimum percentage of 50%.\n\nLaw 42, Arts. 1 and 2, **CEX-47**.\n\n276.\n\nThe sharp increase in global oil prices that began several years into the Participation Contract was not foreseen by the Consortium or Ecuador. It dramatically changed the dynamics of the oil industry in Ecuador and oil industries around the world. It is well recognised in investment treaty arbitration that States retain flexibility to respond to changing circumstances unless they have stabilised their relationship with an investor.440 Ecuador was within its sovereign right to react to the significant change in oil prices, as many States did.441 Indeed, it would not have been reasonable for the contractors to expect that the contractual terms or Ecuadorian law would not change at all in the face of such exceptional prices rises. This is all the more so given that the Consortium knew that the \"interests of the State\" had been a key factor in the overhaul of the hydrocarbons industry in the 1990s and a key qualifier to certain State guarantees. As expressed by the *Perenco* tribunal:\n\nIt would be unsurprising to an experienced oil company that given its access to the State's exhaustible natural resources, with the substantial increase in world oil prices, there was a chance that the State would wish to revisit the economic bargain underlying the contracts.442\n\n*Perenco* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 586, **CLA-329** ; referring *to Sergej Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company, CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company v. The Government of Mongolia*, UNCITRAL, Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 28 April 2011, para. 305.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 629-635.\n\n*Perenco* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 588, **CLA-329**.\n\n277.\n\nIn late 2005, Petroecuador invited the Consortium to negotiate the Participation Contract towards an increase in the State's share and appointed a renegotiation committee for this purpose. However, the Consortium rejected the invitation.443 According to Respondent, it was in the face of the unwillingness of investors to renegotiate their contracts that it decided to enact Law 42.\n\nLetter from Repsol YPF to Petroecuador (12 December 2005), **REX-72**.\n\n278.\n\nFollowing the enactment of Law 42 and Decree No. 1672, the Consortium was then entitled to only 50% of the \"extraordinary\" revenue generated from sales of its production share. The Tribunal does not consider that this fundamentally changed the operation of the Participation Contract for the Consortium. The latter continued to receive a share of production calculated under the Participation Contract. It was still able to earn more revenue with Law 42 at 50% than it did before the oil price rise, notwithstanding that it was not receiving the full potential revenue from those sales. What is important is that the basic structure of the agreement remained in place.\n\n279.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal does not consider that the Participation Contract contained a stabilisation clause such that the Government could make no legislative or regulatory adjustments in what were exceptional circumstances. Claimant has argued that clause 22.1 of the Participation Contract is a legal stabilisation clause. The Tribunal does not accept this. Clause 22.1 is entitled \"applicable legislation\". It does not identify itself as a legal stabilisation clause and is more properly characterised as a choice-of-law clause with a temporal clarification. It does not guarantee that the legal regime in place at the time of contracting shall not change. Indeed, the Participation Contract did contain a number of clauses that sought to maintain the *status quo* of the contract notwithstanding changes in the law (clauses 8.6 and 11.11). The very fact that those clauses were included in the Contract meant that the parties contemplated the possibility of legislative changes that could affect the Participation Contract.\n\n280.\n\nIn light of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal does not accept that Claimant could have reasonably expected that there would be no governmental response to the significant rise in oil prices. The Tribunal does not consider that the enactment of Law 42 and Decree No. 1672 changed the operation of the Participation Contract in such a fundamental way that Claimant's legitimate expectations of not having its contractual agreement disturbed, or unilaterally changed without agreement, were breached. In sum, the Tribunal does not consider that the enactment of Law 42 at 50% breached Claimant's legitimate expectations and thus finds that it did not breach the FET standard of the Treaty.\n\nWhether Law 42 at 99% Breached Claimant's Legitimate Expectations\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe same cannot be said for Law 42 and Decree No. 662 which was issued on 18 October 2007, approximately 18 months after the enactment of Law 42. Decree No. 662 raised the State's participation in the extraordinary income to 99%. Not only did this development fundamentally change the nature of the Participation Contract, it occurred within the context of an increasingly hostile and coercive investment environment. The business and legal framework that existed at the time the investors agreed to the Participation Contract had fundamentally, and prejudicially, changed.\n\n282.\n\nThe enactment of Decree 662 by President Correa marked the beginning of the State's demands that the Contractors revert back to the service contract model. In fact, the application of the 99% participation of the State effectively transformed the Participation Contract into a service contract. It meant that the Contractor's costs were covered but their ability to participate in the upside of high oil prices was severely limited.444 The Contractor's entitlement to full ownership of a percentage of its production was effectively eliminated. Law 42 at 99% changed the foundational premise upon which the Participation Contract had been agreed. This change was made unilaterally by the State in breach of the Participation Contract and the then existing domestic and international legal framework. Specifically, Law 42 at 99% breached clause 10.1 of the Participation Contract pursuant to which Claimant had the right to \"freely dispose of the Crude Oil that corresponds to it,\" subject to domestic supply needs445 and clause 10.3 which guaranteed Claimant the full value of its share of production.446 It also breached clause 15.2 of the Participation Contract which provided that modifying contracts would be possible to negotiate and execute \"upon the prior agreement of the Parties.\"447 Clause 15.2 referred to Law No. 44 which, in turn, referred to the Ecuadorian Constitution, and confirmed that Contractors were delegated the right to explore and exploit hydrocarbons and to participate in production on the basis of agreed contractual terms.448 In addition, according to Ecuador's Investment Promotion and Guarantee Law, contractors such as Claimant enjoyed \"right[s] of ownership without limitations other than those provided under current laws\".449 Article 21 of the same law ensured that foreign investment would be carried out \"with the freedom and guarantees established in the Constitution of the Republic and under the legal and regulatory framework of the Country.\"450 Article 33 recorded that the government would encourage compliance with international agreements for the protection of investments.451 The enactment of Law 42 at 99% ran afoul of the above-mentioned clauses in the Participation Contract and the domestic legal regime, as well as the promise under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty to accord Claimant's investment fair and equitable treatment.\n\n*Perenco* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, para. 603, **CLA-329**.\n\nParticipation Contract, cl. 10.1, **CEX-36**.\n\nParticipation Contract, cl. 10.3, **CEX-36**.\n\nParticipation Contract, cl. 15.2, **CEX-36**.\n\nLaw No. 1993-44, Official register No. 364, published 29 November 1993 at art. 4, **CEX-42**.\n\nLaw No. 46, art. 17(g), **CEX-22**.\n\nLaw No. 46, art. 21, **CEX-22**.\n\nLaw No. 46, art. 33, **CEX-22**.\n\n283.\n\nFollowing the issuance of Decree 662, on 28 December 2007, the Constituent Assembly approved the *Ley de Equidad Tributaria*, which entered into effect the next day.452 That law created a 70% tax on profit from oil sales that would apply when the oil price exceeded a reference price on which Ecuador and the contractor agreed. This applied to all participation contracts, new or modified, entered into from 1 January 2008 onwards.\n\n*Ley Reformatoria para la Equidad Tributaria*, published in *Official Gazette* No. 242 (Supplement) (29 December 2007), Article 170, **CEX-108**.\n\n284.\n\nShortly after the issuance of Decree No. 662 and the enactment of the *Ley de Equidad Tributaria*, President Rafael Correa gave a public radio address during which he declared that oil companies operating in Ecuador had the following three options:\n\nWe are renegotiating the oil contracts. Oil companies have three options:\n\n[1] either they comply with the 99-1 Decree, that is, of the extraordinary profits, extraordinary! [\u2026] Out of the extraordinary gains: 99 percent for the state and 1 percent for the company because the resource is ours. If they disagree, that's the first option, perfect.\n\n[2] We can renegotiate the contract into a services contract which always should have been the preponderant model in the oil industry. Why? Because if the oil is ours we hire somebody to take our oil out, right? We pay for the job, $10 for each barrel of oil extracted, but the rest is for us. So, that's the contract to which we want to go, which was in force at the beginning of the'90s [...]. What does \"participation contract\" mean? They exploit 100 barrels, they take out 100 barrels of our oil, the private and transnational oil companies, and they give us a little piece and the rest they take away [...].\n\nAnd there are people who defend this. How shameful. They want to take us back into that opprobrious past, when they took away with no shame the resources of our country. This revolutionary, patriot and citizen government is renegotiating oil contracts and we want to go to such special service contracts, that's how they are called, where we pay $10 per each barrel of oil, whatever they consider appropriate.. negotiating obviously, but the rest is for us, the owner of the resource. So that's the second option.\n\n[3] And the third option: If they are not happy, no problem. We don't want to rip-off anybody here. How much have they spent in investments? $200 million? Here, have your $200 million and have a nice day, and PetroEcuador will exploit that field. But we will not allow!\n\nMy compatriots, for them to keep taking away our oil. [\u2026] We have to put a limit:\n\n45 days, or if not, they have to continue to comply with the 99-1.453\n\nPresident Correa in January 2008 *cited in* *Burlington* Decision on Liability, para. 38, **CLA-233**.\n\n285.\n\nThe Consortium made Law 42 payments under protest and entered into negotiations with Petroecuador concerning its future operations in Ecuador. In April and December 2008, President Correa acknowledged that one of his tactics to obtain new terms and conditions under oil contracts with foreign companies included the issuance of Decree 662 as a \"tool of pressure\" to force them to negotiate.454 He was later reported as saying:\n\n[T]hey accused us of threatening the rule of law, of committing an exaggeration, and they were probably right [... ]455\n\n*See* Decree Increases the State Participation in the oil surplus to 99% \u2018Only to Negotiate', DIARIO HOY, 22 December 2008, **CEX-91** ; *see also* \"President Dialogues with Oil Companies\" (\"Mandatario dialoga con las petroleras\"), EL TELEGRAFO, 10 August 2008, **CEX-92**.\n\n\"President Dialogues with Oil Companies\" (\"Mandatario dialoga con las petroleras\"), EL TELEGRAFO, 10 August 2008, **CEX-92**.\n\n286.\n\nUnder the Participation Contract, the Government had the power to unilaterally terminate the agreement if the Contractor failed to make payments due or perform its obligations.456 Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law set out the specific grounds for unilateral termination (*caducidad*) of the agreement.457 The *caducidad* process would have required an immediate cessation of all operations being performed by the Consortium under the Participation Contract and the return to the Government of the areas covered by it, along with all equipment, machinery, and other assets used for hydrocarbon exploration and production, without reimbursement.458 It would also entail the automatic loss of all bonds and guarantees that had been issued in accordance with the Hydrocarbons Law and the Participation Contract.459\n\nParticipation Contract cl. 21.2, **CEX-36**.\n\nHydrocarbons Law, art. 74, **CEX-21**.\n\nHydrocarbons Law, art. 75, **CEX-21**.\n\nHydrocarbons Law, art. 75, **CEX-21**.\n\n287.\n\nOn 17 September 2008, the then-Minister of Mines and Petroleum sent to the Executive President of Petroecuador an official communication requesting the initiation of the *caducidad* process for the unilateral termination of the Participation Contract.460 Notwithstanding the Minister's request, the process was not initiated by the Executive President of Petroecuador.461 On 29 October 2008, the new Minister of Mines and Petroleum sent to the Executive President of Petroecuador a second request \"that the early termination process [of the Participation Contract] be initiated immediately.\"462\n\nOficio No. 1291-DM-2008-0814858, 17 September 2008, referenced in Oficio No. 123-DPG-DM-2008-817190, 29 October 2008, **CEX-81**. *See* Oficio No. 1290-DM-2008-0814857, 17 September 2008, sent by the Minister of Mines and Petroleum to the Operator of the Consortium, giving notice of the termination request made on the same date by means of Oficio No. 1291-DM-2008-0814858, **CEX-82**.\n\nRespondent's Letter to ICSID, 24 November 2008, at 4, **CEX-118**.\n\nOficio No. 123-DPG-DM-2008-817190, 29 October 2008, **CEX-81**.\n\n288.\n\nEcuador stated that this communication \"was part of a consistent practice by Respondent to reach mutually acceptable agreements with all of its participation contractors, including [Murphy Ecuador] and its consortium partners, for the voluntary termination of their contracts in return for new service provider contracts and buyouts of their investments.\"463\n\nRespondent's Letter to ICSID, 24 November 2008, at 4, **CEX-118**.\n\n289.\n\nOn 19 February 2009, Petroecuador initiated a *coactiva* proceeding against the Consortium.464 Petroecuador's Chief of Unit of Finance Administration issued a title of credit and a writ of payment confirming that the Consortium owed Petroecuador USD 444,731,349.00.465 Petroecuador issued a second writ of payment on 20 February 2009 and a third writ of payment on 25 February 2009 for the same amount.466\n\n*See supra* para. 105.\n\nPetroecuador's Coactivas Court, Quito, **CEX-85** ; Notification of Coactiva Procedure (19 February 2009), **REX-104**.\n\nSecond writ of payment (20 February 2009), **REX-105**, Third writ of payment (25 February 2009), **REX-107**.\n\n290.\n\nBefore any overdue Law 42 amounts were collected from the Consortium, Ecuador and Repsol YPF reached an oral agreement to move forward with the signing of contractual arrangements. As a result, the *coactiva* proceedings were suspended.467\n\nRespondent's Letter to Arbitral Tribunal, 25 February2009. Murphy ICSID Arbitration, **REX-106**.\n\n291.\n\nOn 12 March 2009, Murphy exited the Consortium by selling its entire interest in Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF.468 On the same day, the Consortium signed a Modification Contract with the State that governed the transitional period during which the terms of a service contract were negotiated, and eventually concluded on 23 November 2010.469\n\nSPA, **CEX-127**. *See also* Ministry of Mines and Oil, Ministerial Resolution No. 257, published in *Official Gazette* No. 501 (7 January 2009), Article 1, **REX-103**.\n\nModification Contract, **REX-19** (abridged version); **REX-109** (full version).\n\n292.\n\nThe Tribunal holds that the enactment and enforcement of Law 42 at 99% constituted a violation of Claimant's legitimate expectation that the basic terms of the Participation Contract would not change except within the confines of the law and pursuant to a negotiated, mutual agreement between contractual partners. Claimant's legitimate expectation that it would be treated fairly in a business-like manner as a contractual business partner was also breached by Ecuador's coercive conduct in negotiations.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal thus finds that Ecuador breached the FET standard at Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty when it enacted Decree 662 on 18 October 2007 and when it took actions subsequently to enforce it.\n\n294.\n\nAs the Tribunal has found that Ecuador breached Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, it is not necessary to determine Claimant's claims that Ecuador breached other provisions of the Treaty such as Article II(3)(c) (the \"umbrella\" clause); (2) Article II(3)(a) (full protection and security); (3) Article II(3)(b) (non-impairment through arbitrary measures); and (4) Article III(1) (expropriation). The Tribunal is satisfied that the damages alleged by Claimant under the other heads of claim are the same as those alleged under its claim for breach of the FET standard; thus finding a breach under Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty as opposed to under any other provision invoked by Claimant has no impact on the calculation of damages. Moreover, since Claimant has relied on the violation of several of the Treaty's provisions as alternative grounds for its claim for compensation, once the Tribunal has found that one of those alternative grounds is well-founded, deciding on the other grounds is no longer part of the Tribunal's mission. It would also not be in keeping with the Tribunal's duty to conduct these proceedings in as efficient a manner as possible.\n\n**VIII. CLAIMANT'S RIGHT TO CLAIM COMPENSATION**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nThe Parties dispute whether Murphy claims compensation for losses in its own right or whether its claims are solely for the losses of Murphy Ecuador, which have been settled. In order to assess whether Muprhy's claims are properly made in its own right and extant, it is useful to recall first the relevant facts before turning to the positions of the Parties.\n\n296.\n\nOn 12 March 2009, Murphy sold its interest in Murphy Ecuador pursuant to the SPA concluded between Canam and Repsol YPF.470 At that time, Murphy on the one hand and the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, on the other hand had respective ICSID arbitrations pending.471 Under clause 12.7 of the SPA, Canam and Repsol YPF assigned to Murphy all rights and privileges of Murphy Ecuador that were necessary for Murphy to prosecute its treaty claims against Ecuador.472\n\nSPA, **CEX-127** ; *see supra* para. 108.\n\n*See supra* paras. 95 and 97.\n\nSPA, **CEX-127** ; *see infra* para. 304.\n\n297.\n\nOn 23 November 2010, the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador\u2014which was then owned by Repsol YPF and no longer by Murphy\u2014, reached a settlement with Ecuador by which it settled all of its claims.473 Consequently, the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, withdrew its ICSID claims, with prejudice, bringing the Repsol ICSID Arbitration to an end.474 Little under one month later, on 15 December 2010, a majority of the tribunal in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration held that it was without jurisdiction resulting in the termination of that arbitration.475\n\nRepsol Settlement Agreement, **REX-21** ; *see supra* para. 113.\n\n*See supra* para. 113.\n\nICSID Award on Jurisdiction, **CEX-3** ; *see supra* para. 117.\n\n***I.

Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n298.\n\nClaimant contends that it is bringing its own claims under the BIT.476 It submits that Murphy Ecuador was merely a vehicle through which Claimant invested in Ecuador.477 Claimant argues that its investments in Ecuador comprise, *inter alia*, its \"shares of stock\" and \"other interests in a company\" and \"interests in the assets thereof.\"478 Its investment also included an \"investment contract,\" rights \"conferred by law and contract,\" claims \"to performance having economic value, and associated with an investment.\"479\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 153-154; Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 80:10-15.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 130. *See also* Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 173; Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 78:23 to 79:11.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 128-129, 146; Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 171.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 128-129, 146; Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 171-172; Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 77:1-9.\n\n299.\n\nClaimant contends that its treaty claims differ from Murphy Ecuador's claims, which are based on the Participation Contract.480 It alleges that the distinction between contract claims and treaty claims means that a \"subsidiary can never \u2018bind' its shareholder (let alone its former shareholder) with respect to the shareholder's pending BIT rights and claims absent the shareholder's separate and express agreement.\"481\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 130. *See also* Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 173; Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 78:15-22.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 139, *referring to* *EnCana* Award, para. 118, **CLA-79**.\n\n***B. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n300.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimant's claims are solely for the losses of Murphy Ecuador.482 It argues that, as a result, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over this case because Article VI of the BIT covers \"only losses distinctly suffered by Murphy International\".483 Respondent explains:\n\nNo basis whatsoever can be identified in the Statement of Claim for distinguishing between the harm allegedly suffered by Murphy Ecuador (and which formed the object of claims now withdrawn with prejudice) and that claimed by its indirect shareholder, Murphy International. Therefore, because the damage caused by breach of the BIT, and invoked to support calling upon the Tribunal's jurisdiction, must be damage suffered by the shareholder itself, jurisdiction over the claims here is lacking.484\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 134-135, *citing* *ST-AD GmbH v.

As a result, because all of Claimant's claims are ultimately based upon the rights of Murphy Ecuador (Claimant having chosen not to pursue the unmerited claim made in its first arbitration for diminished value of its indirect shareholding), no compensable claims remain and the case must be dismissed.487\n\nHearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 216:9-12.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 2 (Respondent's emphasis). *See also* Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 101-104, *referring* to SPA, Article 5.1.11 (\" Legal Proceedings\"), **CEX-127** (stating that the SPA acknowledges the participation of Murphy Ecuador in ICSID Case No. ARB/08/10); Repsol's Request for Arbitration and Provisional Measures, **REX-25** ; Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 140; Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 216:13 to 217:5; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 37-39.\n\n2. **Whether the SPA Prevented the Settlement by Repsol YPF, or Murphy Ecuador's successor, of Claimant's Claims**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nOn 12 March 2009, Claimant sold its entire interest in Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF pursuant to the SPA.488\n\nSPA, **CEX-127** ; *see supra* paras. 103 and 108.\n\n304.\n\nThe following provisions of the SPA addressed the issue of Claimant's claims against Ecuador:\n\n12.7 Pending Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n12.7.1 Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Murphy Exploration & Production Company - International, an Affiliate of Seller (\"MEPCI\"), shall retain, and shall prosecute in its sole discretion, all the claims it may have against Ecuador for violation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Ecuador and the United States, including the claims made in the current ICSID arbitration that MEPCI has initiated against Ecuador (the \"Arbitration\"). The Arbitration involves claims, among others, for the diminution in value of MEPCI's investment in Ecuador through the Company.\n\n12.7.2 Purchaser further acknowledges that the claims that are the subject matter of the Arbitration are \"investor\" claims properly vested and owned by MEPCI and not \"Company\" claims vested or retained by Company. All rights, privileges, and future awards arising from the Arbitration are retained by MEPCI. Purchaser hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right or claim whatsoever to the rights, privileges and future awards arising from the Arbitration.\n\n12.7.3 To the extent that certain rights or privileges of Company are required to be held by MEPCI in the process of prosecuting the Arbitration or collecting any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal, Purchaser and its Affiliates, predecessors, successors in interest and interrelated companies, employees, officers, directors, agents, attorneys and other representatives, do hereby assign to MEPCI all rights and privileges of the Company which are the subject matter of the Arbitration, including but not limited to (i) claims to money or claims to performance having economic value and (ii) any rights conferred by Law of contract. For the avoidance of doubt, the assignment of rights and privileges set forth in this Clause 12.7.3 shall be limited to safeguarding the due and punctual prosecution of the Arbitration and the collection of any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal in favor of MEPCI and shall not confer any monetary rights or performance rights which do not form part of the subject matter of the Arbitration.\n\n12.7.4 Purchaser agrees not to act against MEPCI's interest in connection with MEPCI's claims in the Arbitration. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser's agreement after the Closing Date to in any way amend the Operations Contracts, or a decision by any member of the Repsol YPF S.A. group of companies after the Closing Date to settle or dismiss any arbitration claim against the GOE, shall not be deemed to be an act against MEPCI's interest for purposes of this Clause 12.7.4.\n\n12.7.5 The Seller agrees to reimburse, indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless from any damage, loss or expense resulting from an award in the Arbitration.\n\n***A. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n305.\n\nClaimant contends that the SPA prevented either Repsol or Murphy Ecuador's successor (Amodaimi Oil) from settling the claims of Claimant.489 It states that \"the over-arching goal of the SPA was to allow Murphy International to exit the Consortium [\u2026] and to allow the other members of the Consortium to remain in operation.\"490\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 155; Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 80:16-22.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 10.\n\n306.\n\nOn the date of conclusion of the SPA, both Claimant and Murphy Ecuador had pending ICSID arbitrations against Respondent.491 While Murphy Ecuador had brought contractual claims and Claimant treaty claims, Claimant states that its losses were equivalent to Murphy Ecuador's.492 Claimant knew that once it sold its interest in Murphy Ecuador, it would not benefit from any subsequent compensation granted to, or settlement arrived at, by Murphy Ecuador. Claimant states:\n\nThrough the SPA, Canam and Repsol agreed that Murphy International alone would receive any compensation for the losses through Murphy Ecuador that Murphy International was claiming in its own arbitration. [T]he entirety of the SPA's Clause 12 purported to ensure that Murphy International, and not Murphy Ecuador, would receive any compensation for such losses, because it was Murphy International, as the investor and real party in interest, that had suffered those losses\u2014not Repsol, which was acquiring Murphy Ecuador's interest in the Participation Contract at a steep discount.493\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 21, 22.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 23.\n\n307.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the *raison d'etre* of clause 12 of the SPA was \"to ensure that Murphy International was the only entity able to recover the losses that it had suffered (either directly or through Murphy Ecuador).\"494 The preservation of Murphy International's treaty claims was \"at the heart\" of clause 12.7.495 Claimant interprets each provision of clause 12.7 as follows.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 11.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 7.\n\n308.\n\nFirst, clause 12.7.1\u2014which states that Claimant \"shall retain, and shall prosecute in its sole discretion, all the claims it may have against Ecuador for violation of [the BIT] including the claims made in the current ICSID arbitration that [Claimant] has initiated against Ecuador\"496\u2014 \"made clear that the sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol did not affect Murphy International's own claims and rights under the BIT, further acknowledging that they were independent from Murphy Ecuador's contractual claims.\"497\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 156, *referring* to SPA, cl. 12.7.1, **CEX-127**. *See also* Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 199, *referring to* SPA, cls. 12.7.1-12.7.2, **CEX-127** ; Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 81:17 to 82:10.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 24.\n\n309.\n\nSecond, Claimant alleges that clause 12.7.2, wherein Repsol waived \"any right or claim whatsoever to the rights, privileges and future awards arising from the Arbitration\", confirms that \"Repsol, in its capacity as Murphy Ecuador's new 100% shareholder, relinquished any possibility to eventually receive any compensation for such losses\" in favour of Claimant.498\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 25.\n\n310.\n\nThird, Claimant contends that \"clause 12.7.3 of the SPA assigned to Murphy International all of Murphy Ecuador's rights and claims for losses that Murphy International was pursuing in its own ICSID Arbitration.\"499 As a result of this assignment, Claimant posits that \"Murphy Ecuador had no rights and claims to settle, to the extent that such rights and claims were or are required to be held by Murphy International to recover on its own BIT claim.\"500\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20. *See also* Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 203, *referring to* SPA, cl. 12.7.3, **CEX-127**.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26.\n\n311.\n\nClaimant disputes Respondent's argument that the assignment of claims under clause 12.7.3 was ineffective. As a preliminary matter, it identifies the purpose of this provision as follows:\n\n[O]ne goal of that provision was to avoid any potential risk of double recovery or double payment for the losses that, although equivalent in monetary terms, both Murphy International and Murphy Ecuador could claim against Ecuador, albeit based on different legal grounds. Murphy International was the intended claimant and beneficiary for all of those claims following the execution of the SPA. Had Murphy Ecuador continued to exist and attempted to pursue claims against Ecuador in its own name after the SPA, Ecuador would have been entitled to object to that pursuit by virtue of Clause 12.7.3.501\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19.\n\n312.\n\nClaimant also contests the allegation that it is inconsistent for it to argue that the assignment of Murphy Ecuador's rights to Claimant via clause 12.7.3 of the SPA was effective on the one hand, and that the Treaty claims and Murphy Ecuador's contractual claims are distinct, on the other.502 Claimant contends that \"Murphy International was \u2018required' to hold Murphy Ecuador's rights and privileges to ensure that only Murphy International was entitled to claim and eventually collect any compensation for losses to Murphy Ecuador under the to-be-terminated Participation Contract.\"503 Claimant explains further:\n\n[T]he SPA preserved what Claimant always held (its own BIT claims) and, in addition, granted to Claimant any and all related rights of Murphy Ecuador as were necessary to ensure that Claimant's own BIT claims would not be adversely affected by the sale. Importantly, it is Claimant's view that the acquisition of those additional rights and claims was not \"required\" in order for Claimant to pursue the instant BIT arbitration, although in the absence of clear case law at the time, it was included in the SPA out of an abundance of caution in the event the tribunal ultimately deciding Murphy International's BIT claims took a contrary view.504\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 28.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 28.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 8. *See also* Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15, and Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 4.\n\n313.\n\nIn response to Respondent's allegation that the assignment was invalid because it was not authorised by Ecuador, Claimant submits that authorisation was not required. It says that the Participation Contract and Ecuadorian law required governmental authorisation for the assignment of *rights* arising under the Participation Contract but not for the assignment of *claims* arising out of violations of the Participation Contract.505 But, even if prior authorisation from Ecuador had been required, Claimant submits that seeking it would have been futile.506 Furthermore, Claimant submits that Ecuador acquiesced in the assignment. Ecuador knew of the SPA before it executed the Repsol Settlement Agreement in November 2010, and if not then, it knew by the time Claimant filed its first memorial in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration on 30 April 2009 (the SPA was attached as an exhibit).507 It claims that Ecuador's passivity regarding the SPA's assignment provision demonstrates that it had no issue with it.508\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 32-33, *referring to* Hydrocarbons Law, art. 79, **CEX-21** ; Executive Decree No. 1363, Article 7, **REX-127** ; Participation Contract, cl. 16.1, **CEX-36** (emphasis added). *See also* Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34. *See also* Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17.\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 164; Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 83:12 to 84:1; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35, *referring to* Claimant's ICSID Memorial on the Merits (30 April 2009), **REX-135**. *See also* Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 36-37.\n\n314.\n\nClaimant asserts that the assignment in clause 12.7.3 was unconditional and perfected immediately.509 Clause 12.7.3 used the BIT's definition of an investment, which supports the argument that the assignment covered all treaty claims regardless of forum.510 It states that \"[t]he parties need not have used different or more precise language to perfect the assignment of Murphy Ecuador's claims. Indeed, the broadness of the assignment language compels the opposite conclusion.\"511 Claimant also notes that clause 12.7.1 \"ensures that Murphy International retains the right to prosecute \u2018 *all the claims it may have* against Ecuador for violation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Ecuador and the United States *including the claims* made in the current ICSID arbitration that [Murphy International] has initiated against Ecuador.'\"512\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 38; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 14.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 14, *referring to* US-Ecuador BIT, Article I(1)(a)(iii) & (v), **CEX-1**. *See also* Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16, *referring to* Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 42.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 41.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15, *citing* SPA, cl. 12.7.1, **CEX-127** (Claimant's emphasis).\n\n315.\n\nClaimant does not agree with Ecuador's argument that its claim for lost cash flows goes beyond the subject matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration and, therefore, the scope of clause 12.7.3.513 First, it submits that its lost cash flows claims \"are part of its BIT claims and need not be covered by clause 12.7.3 in order to be pursued\".514 But, if not, Claimant points to the broad wording of clause 12.7.3 as well as the broad definition in clause 12.7.1 of the \"subject matter of the Arbitration\", which shows that the assignment covered these claims:515\n\nMurphy International's claim for diminution in value (in the ICSID arbitration) and its current claim for lost cash flows (in the UNCITRAL arbitration) are one and the same: a claim for the losses that Murphy International suffered in relation to its investment, as Murphy Ecuador's indirect 100% shareholder, due to the forced and premature termination of the Participation Contract, which directly prevented Murphy International from receiving the economic benefits that it would have otherwise received from March 12, 2009 (the date of the sale), to January 31, 2012 (the original date of the Participation Contract's termination).516\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 43, *referring* to Hearing Transcript (21 Nov. 2014), 758:13 to 758:23, Respondent's Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 997-999 and Respondent's Rejoinder, paras. 658-661.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 44. *See also* Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\n316.\n\nClaimant clarifies that the DCF approach it used in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration and the lost cash flows approach it uses now are different methodologies to calculate the same losses.517\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 45-50.\n\n317.\n\nClaimant alleges that clause 12.7.4 of the SPA, which prevents Repsol from acting against Claimant's interest in connection with its arbitration claims, was simply a means of \"further ensur[ing] that only Murphy International collected any compensation for the losses through Murphy Ecuador that Murphy International was claiming in its own ICSID arbitration.\"518 Claimant rejects Ecuador's contention that clause 12.7.4 \"expressly authorized Murphy Ecuador to \u2018settle or dismiss any arbitration claim' against Ecuador.\"519 It submits that clause 12.7.4 \"requires that Repsol \u2018not [...] act against [Murphy International's] interest in connection with [Murphy International's] claims in the Arbitration.'\"520 This means, Claimant argues, that Murphy Ecuador could not have settled the treaty claims of Claimant.521\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 29, *referring to* SPA, cl. 12.7.4, **CEX-127**.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20, *referring to* Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 22, *citing* SPA, cl. 12.7.4, **CEX-127**.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 204, *referring to* SPA, cl. 12.7.4, **CEX-127**.\n\n***B. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n318.\n\nRespondent alleges that, through clause 12.7.4 of the SPA, Claimant authorised the settlement of Murphy Ecuador's claims under the Participation Contract and agreed to be bound by any such settlement.522 Respondent submits that the binding effect of the Repsol Settlement Agreement on Claimant derives not from the settlement agreement as such, but from the SPA.523 According to Respondent, clause 12.7.4 not only gave Repsol the right to settle Murphy Ecuador's arbitration claims, it also expressed that such a settlement would not be deemed contrary to Claimant's interest.524 It explains the relation of clause 12.7.4 and clause 12.7.1:\n\n[W]hile acknowledging Murphy International's right to retain and pursue whatever claims *Murphy International* might have against Ecuador (Clause 12.7.1), Repsol YPF expressly reserved its own right and that of Murphy Ecuador to settle any arbitration claim against Ecuador (Clause 12.7.4), including the claims Murphy Ecuador (now part of the Repsol YPF group of companies) asserted in the Consortium arbitration. In other words, both Murphy Ecuador and Murphy International retained their *own* rights, including the right to settle their claims made against Ecuador.525\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 27, *referring to* SPA, cl. 12.7.4, **CEX-127**.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 33.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 167; Hearing Transcript (20 Nov. 2014), 761:10 to 762:2; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21, *citing* SPA, cl. 12.7.4, **CEX-127***.*\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 163 (emphasis by Respondent). *See also* Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 228:18 to 229:22; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 5.\n\n319.\n\nRespondent contends that Murphy Ecuador was sold to Repsol with the entirety of its rights under the Participation Contract.526 It alleges that Claimant knew that Repsol had to acquire the entirety of Murphy Ecuador's rights because:\n\n[T]he settlement of all outstanding claims of the Consortium Members, including Murphy Ecuador's claims for the repayment of the historical Law 42 payments and the claim for alleged cash flows under the Participation Contract, both asserted in the Consortium ICSID arbitration, was a *conditio sine qua non* for the contract renegotiation and the eventual Settlement.527\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 23. *See also*, Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 24, *referring to* ME Memo Dec. 2008, page 00185, **REX-137**.\n\n320.\n\nRespondent contests Claimant's argument that clause 12.7.3 of the SPA transferred the rights of Murphy Ecuador to Claimant. It does not agree that clause 12.7.3 was intended to prevent double recovery, in the form of Claimant and Murphy Ecuador recovering for the same losses, by requiring the former to hold the rights and privileges of the latter.528 Respondent points out that clause 12.7.3 identifies as its purpose the protection of Claimant's prosecution of its investor claims, which differs from precluding Murphy Ecuador from prosecuting its contract claims.529\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 4, *referring to* Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17 *.*\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 5 *.*\n\n321.\n\nRespondent also submits that Claimant's argument that clause 12.7.3 of the SPA transferred Murphy Ecuador's rights to Claimant is contradicted by (a) clause 12.7.4 of the SPA, which allows Murphy Ecuador to \"settle or dismiss any arbitration claim against the [Respondent]\";530 and (b) clause 12.7.5, which \"confirms that after the SPA, Murphy Ecuador continued to be the rightful holder and beneficiary of its claims under the Participation Contract\".531 Respondent reiterates that both Repsol and Claimant needed Murphy Ecuador to retain its own claims. This was necessary, for Repsol, to be able to renegotiate a contract with Respondent, and, for Claimant, to recover its investment through the SPA.532\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 8, *citing* SPA, cl. 12.7.4, **CEX-127***.*\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 9 *.*\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 6-7, *referring to* Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 11, 23-24 *.*\n\n322.\n\nRespondent clarifies that Claimant cannot invoke rights under the SPA and the SPA cannot be invoked against Respondent as neither is party to it.533 Respondent contends that clause 12.7.3 did not effectively transfer to Claimant any of Murphy Ecuador's rights because the purported assignment was (a) subject to a condition precedent that never materialized (as to which, see next paragraph); and (b) not authorised as required by both the Participation Contract and the Hydrocarbons Law of Ecuador.534\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 165, *referring to* SPA, **CEX-127**.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 6. *See also* Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 166.\n\n323.\n\nAs to the condition precedent, Respondent states that clause 12.7.3 provided for an assignment only \"to the extent that certain rights and privileges of [Murphy Ecuador] are required to be held by [Murphy International] in the process of prosecuting the [ICSID] Arbitration or collecting any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal.535 It explains that the condition precedent to the assignment was \"indeterminate\" in its terms, and that it became forever indeterminable when the Murphy ICSID Arbitration was dismissed.536\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 10, *citing* SPA, cl. 12.7.3, **CEX-127** (italics omitted) *.*\n\nHearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 232:1 to 233:11;

it explains that clause 12.7.3 covers any rights under the Participation Contract, including those relating to the arbitration.541\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16.\n\nHearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 231:7-12. *See also* Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15, *referring to* Hydrocarbons Law, art. 79, **CEX-21** ;

it submits that it \"raised the implications of SPA Clause 12.7.3 immediately in its first written submission in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration after the conclusion of the SPA, and (b) [\u2026] raised it in this arbitration immediately after Claimant relied on Clauses 12.7.1 and 12.7.2 of the SPA (*but not Clause 12.7.3*).\"544\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, footnote 17.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 16, *referring to* Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19 (Respondent's emphasis).\n\n327.\n\nEven were clause 12.7.3 effective, Respondent notes that the assignment in clause 12.7.3 excludes Claimant's claim for cash flows from March 2009 onwards.545 It argues that clause 12.7.3 assigns only those \"rights and privileges of [Murphy Ecuador] which are the subject matter of the [ICSID] Arbitration\".546 Respondent asserts that Claimant never brought a claim for cash flows under the Participation Contract in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration:547\n\n[E]ven if you could deem the right of Murphy Ecuador to settle its claims somehow affected by the SPA, such a fact would be limited to the loss asserted by the Claimant in the ICSID arbitration, since that's a defined term in the Agreement. Here, of course, Claimant is now claiming all lost cash flows in contrast to what it asserted in the first case. So even if it had an effect, it would only be a limited effect.548\n\nHearing Transcript (20 Nov. 2014), 758:18 to 759:17.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18, *citing* SPA, cl. 12.7.3, **CEX-127** (italics omitted) *.*\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 19-20 *.*\n\nHearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 229:23 to 230:8.\n\n328.\n\nRespondent disputes Claimant's defense that Claimant's current lost cash flows claim is identical to its ICSID Arbitration claim for diminution in the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador's shares. Ecuador alleges that \"[t]he incongruity between Claimant's ICSID and UNCITRAL claims for loss is not merely the result of \u2018using different methods and available data.' Claimant is claiming in this proceeding loss that is conceptually and materially different from that it claimed in its ICSID arbitration.\"549 It states that the \"express rejection of the DCF method [in Claimant's calculation of damages] proves beyond contention that Claimant is no longer claiming loss pertaining to a diminution in the FMV of its shares in Murphy Ecuador.\"550\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 22, *citing* Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 50 *.*\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26 *.

On the same date, the Consortium and Ecuador executed the Final Modification Contract which converted the Participation Contract into a services contract.\n\n***A. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n330.\n\nClaimant's position is that the Repsol Settlement Agreement did not settle its treaty claims: \"since the BIT claims of Murphy International are separate and distinct from the contract claims of Murphy Ecuador, the Repsol Settlement could not settle Murphy International's BIT claims.\"551\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15.\n\n331.\n\nClaimant submits that it had neither interest in,552 nor control over, Murphy Ecuador at the time of the settlement because it had sold Murphy Ecuador 18 months prior.553 Claimant notes that in the ICSID Award on Jurisdiction, issued just after the Repsol Settlement Agreement on 15 December 2010, \"the ICSID Tribunal [\u2026] ruled that Murphy Ecuador did not have the ability to negotiate on behalf of and bind Murphy International\".554\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 7, 61-62. *See also* Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 2.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 25, *referring to* *SAUR International S.A. v.

As a result, \"any action by Repsol, on behalf of the Consortium, before the Ecuadorian authorities, would have been done on behalf of the legal persons composing the Consortium (i.e., Murphy Ecuador) and not on behalf of the owners of the shares of the companies forming the Consortium (i.e., Canam and Murphy International.)\"\n\n332.\n\nClaimant submits that as it was not a party to the Repsol Settlement Agreement, it is not bound by it. Ecuadorian law limits the binding effect of settlement agreements to their direct parties.555\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 63, *citing* Ecuadorian Civil Code, Article 2363, **CEX-41**. *See also* Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 218, *referring to* *Sempra* Award, para. 227, **CLA-35**.\n\n333.\n\nClaimant also argues that the settlement covered only the pending claims in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration, which did not include Claimant's claims in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration. The parties to the SPA had assigned to Murphy all of Murphy Ecuador's claims for losses that were being claimed indirectly by Murphy in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.556 In light of this assignment, Claimant argues that a settlement affecting its rights would be void under Ecuadorian law, which prohibits agreements that settle the rights of third parties.557 It would also have been in violation of clause 12.7.4 of the SPA, which prohibited Repsol from acting against Claimant's interest in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.558\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 64. *See also* Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26, *referring to* *Hochtief AG v.

The SPA had carved out the claims for losses occurring *before* 12 March 2009 so they could not be settled.565\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 77.\n\n337.\n\nBut, more importantly, Claimant submits that \"the Settlement brought absolutely no economic benefits to Murphy International\" given its complete lack of interest in Murphy Ecuador at that time.566 Claimant also suggests that Murphy Ecuador was not compensated for its losses pursuant to the settlement, as neither the Repsol Settlement Agreement nor the Final Modification Contract refers to compensation for Murphy Ecuador or Repsol YPF.567\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 69.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 78, *referring to* Repsol Settlement Agreement, **REX-21** ; Final Modification Contract (23 November 2010), **CEX-175**. *See also* Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 30.\n\n338.\n\nSixth and last, Claimant contends that the settlement is irrelevant to liability and damages because, \"in the hypothetical but-for world that the Tribunal must use in assessing compensation\", neither the SPA nor the settlement would have existed but for Respondent's BIT breaches.568 Claimant clarifies that the SPA mitigated its losses, which is why it has deducted the sale price, plus the accrued interest, from the damages claimed.569\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 70, *referring to Factory at Chorzow* (Germany v.

Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n339.\n\nRespondent alleges that, under international law, a shareholder can be bound by the settlement of a company's claim if its interests are adequately satisfied.570 Respondent contends that \"[a]lthough not a party to the [Repsol] Settlement [Agreement], Claimant is bound by it because it was enabled by Claimant, through Claimant's consent to SPA Clause 12.7.4, and because Claimant's interests were adequately satisfied though the SPA price.\"571 According to Respondent, because all the claims of Murphy Ecuador in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration were settled, \"there are no remaining rights or privileges of Murphy Ecuador that could still be held by Claimant.\"572\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 26, *citing* *Sempra* Award, para. 227, **RLA-24**.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 31.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 21. *See also*, Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para 34 *.*\n\n340.\n\nRespondent submits that the settlement reached with Ecuador covered all potential claims that Murphy Ecuador could have asserted based on the Participation Contract.573 It notes that, \"the scope of the settlement agreement entered into between Ecuador and the Consortium extended to any claims or losses *ever* asserted in the course of the Repsol Arbitration, regardless of when they were made and whether their amount may have evolved in the proceedings.\"574\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 175.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 173, *referring to* Repsol Settlement Agreement, p. 14, **REX-21** (emphasis by Respondent). *See also* Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 36, *citing* Repsol's Request for Arbitration and Provisional Measures, paras. 134(iii)-(iv), **REX-25**.\n\n341.\n\nRespondent contests the argument that Murphy Ecuador settled only claims that arose after the SPA was executed.575 It points out that the \"\u2018sweeping waiver' [found in Clause 29.1.2 of the Final Modification Contract] makes no exception for claims arising before the execution of the SPA.\"576 Respondent also highlights the similarly broad language in clause 29.1.5 of the Final Modification Contract; it alleges that, through this provision, Murphy Ecuador agreed to the withdrawal, with prejudice, of claims arising after the execution of the SPA as well as those arising before.577 It further points out that the argument that the settlement covered only the claims that were then pending in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration rests on two allegedly mistaken assumptions: that (1) the assignment under clause 12.7.3 of the SPA was effective; and (2) Murphy Ecuador had successfully carved out its claims from that arbitration.578\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 40, *referring to* Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 77.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 40, *referring to* Final Modification Contract, cl. 29.1.2, **REX-116**.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 40, *referring to* Final Modification Contract, cl. 29.1.5, **REX-116**. *See also* Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 174, *referring to* Final Modification Contract, pp. 106-107, **CEX-175**.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35.\n\n342.\n\nRespondent submits that \"the \u2018material or legal benefit\u2019 Murphy International enjoyed from [the SPA and the Settlement] did not stem from the Settlement as such, but from the SPA in the form of the SPA price, which allowed Claimant to recover its investment.\"579 It submits that the USD 78.9 million sale price that Repsol YPF paid Claimant adequately satisfied its interest as it \"reflected accurately the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador\u2019s rights and claims under the Participation Contract as of March 2009.\"580 This was supplemented by Repsol YPF\u2019s assumption of Murphy Ecuador\u2019s liabilities, estimated at USD 86 million.581 Respondent also notes that, after the sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF and before the November 2010 Settlement\u2014under which Ecuador extended the Consortium Members \"significant economic benefits\"\u2014, Murphy Ecuador received its share of cash flow from the Block 16 production.582\n\nRespondent\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 34, *referring to* Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 28-30, 33.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 28.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 29, *referring to* SPA, cls. 8.1.1, 8.1.2, 8.1.3, **CEX-127** ; Hearing Transcript (19 Nov. 2014), 552:11-19 (cross-examination of Mr. Brent C.

It points out that the carve-out applied only to the historical Law 42 payments and not to the lost cash flows under the Participation Contract.585 It also stresses that, while Murphy Ecuador may have reduced the amount claimed, it did not waive either its legal claim or its rights to such payments.586 It explains that \"the withdrawal of a claim, even when it is done with prejudice, does not, unless otherwise agreed, amount to a waiver of any underlying rights of the party.\"587\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 22, *referring to* Statement of Reply, 205; Hearing.

Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n346.\n\nRespondent argues that awarding compensation to Claimant for either category of its claims would result in both double payment by Ecuador (Ecuador having already compensated Murphy Ecuador with benefits under the new contract), and double compensation for Claimant (Claimant having already received the fair market value of these very same rights by Repsol).591 Ecuador argues:\n\nMurphy Ecuador has always had the corresponding 20 percent interest in the Consortium's take from the oil field in the production of Block 16, except for the amount, of course, that it settled as part of its settlement with Ecuador. [...] Another key part of the equation is that Murphy International was compensated for the indirect loss that it held\u2014indirect loss that it had a right to claim for before these claims were settled when it sold Murphy Ecuador to Repsol. [\u2026] So, Repsol paid for Murphy Ecuador's claims, the outstanding claims that were existent then under the ICSID Arbitration. And Murphy got paid--Repsol paid for the future cash flow claims and demands of Murphy Ecuador under the Modification Contracts and then eventually under the new service agreement.592\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 40.\n\nHearing Transcript (20 Nov. 2014), 752:15 to 753:7.\n\n347.\n\nRespondent argues that Murphy Ecuador waived definitively all of the claims it held at the time of the SPA and the Repsol Settlement Agreement in exchange for compensation paid by Ecuador (in the form of cash flow payments for Block 16 production under the Modification Contract, and the extension of significant economic benefits under the Final Modification Contract).593 As a result, Ecuador argues that Murphy Ecuador has been compensated for any rights it had to historical Law 42 payments and cash flows and no damages under either category remain compensable to Murphy.594\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 36-37.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 38.\n\n348.\n\nRespondent also argues that the prohibition against double recovery in international law applies even when the subsidiary and the shareholder assert different legal bases to claim the same losses.595\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 149.\n\n***B. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n349.\n\nClaimant asserts:\n\nMurphy is not seeking to be compensated twice for the same damage. Murphy seeks compensation for breaches of its own rights under the BIT. The November 2010 Agreement did not constitute a \"recovery\" for Murphy, because none of the parties to that agreement were able to settle Murphy\u2019s claims and no benefit obtained by those parties compensated Murphy. Further, to the extent Repsol purchased any remaining benefit owed to Murphy Ecuador under the Participation Contract, Murphy deducts the proceeds of that sale from its claim, so there is not even a theoretical risk of double recovery in any event.596\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 229; Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 85:4-21. *See also* Hearing Transcript (20 Nov. 2014), 699:7-12; Claimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 11-12.\n\n350.\n\nClaimant also stresses that its \"claim is limited to the term of the Original Participation Contract ending in January 2012. By contrast, the settlement of Repsol and Murphy Ecuador\u2019s successor\u2019s claims occurred in the context of agreeing to a new service contract to replace the Participation Contract for the period after January 2012.\"597 Murphy Ecuador did not settle and nor was it compensated for any losses that effectively occurred before 12 March 2009.598 The members of the Repsol Consortium agreed to withdraw their claims and waive their rights to compensation, but did not acknowledge settlement for their losses.599\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 214.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 77-78.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 78.\n\n351.\n\nClaimant submits therefore that Ecuador has not paid for Murphy's losses claimed in this arbitration even once, let alone twice.600 Rather, Ecuador ended up increasing its total take from Block 16 as a result of wrongful conduct.601 In that light, Claimant argues that even if a threat of double recovery existed, which is denied, it follows from the unlawful conduct of Respondent; that unlawful conduct cannot excuse Ecuador's obligation to compensate Claimant.602\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 79.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 79.\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 32.\n\n***II. Analysis of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nThe question whether Claimant is entitled to compensation for claims for losses in its own right and if so, whether the claim for loss is extant, involves several interrelated issues: (1) the Tribunal must examine whether Claimant is entitled under the Treaty to claim for losses to its indirect investment, Murphy Ecuador; (2) the Tribunal must interpret clause 12.7 of the SPA to ascertain what rights and privileges of Murphy Ecuador, if any, were assigned to Murphy for the latter's prosecution of its Treaty claims, and what rights and privileges, if any, Murphy Ecuador retained following its sale to Repsol YPF; and, finally (3) the Tribunal shall ascertain what claims were brought in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration and settled, with prejudice, with the conclusion of the Repsol Settlement Agreement, and what impact that may have on Murphy's entitlement to claim for loss.\n\n353.\n\nThe Tribunal shall address these issues in the following order: (1) Claimant's entitlement under the Treaty to claim for losses to its indirect investment; (2) the effect of clause 12.7 of the SPA; (3) Murphy Ecuador's claims in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration; and (4) the Repsol Settlement Agreement.\n\n1. **Claimant's entitlement under the Treaty to claim for losses to its indirect investment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n354.\n\nIt is uncontested that at the time of the breach of the Treaty by Ecuador, *i.e.*, 18 October 2007 (being the date Decree No. 662 was issued under Law 42 to increase the State's additional participation to 99%), Murphy was the 100% owner of Canam (a holding company), which, in turn, was the 100% owner of Murphy Ecuador. At that time, Murphy Ecuador's share in the Consortium was 20%. Consequently, at the time of Ecuador\u2019s Treaty breach, Murphy held an indirect 20% interest in the Consortium through its ownership of Murphy Ecuador.\n\n355.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT expressly covers indirect investments. It refers to \"any kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes: [\u2026] a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof [\u2026].\" Murphy Ecuador was owned and controlled by Murphy over the relevant period. Murphy\u2019s investment consisted of its 100% indirect shareholding in Murphy Ecuador through Canam and thus Murphy Ecuador\u2019s rights under the Participation Contract.603\n\nResponse to Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 128, 146.\n\n356.\n\nAccordingly, as of 18 October 2007, Murphy had standing to claim for losses at international law caused to its investment in Murphy Ecuador by Ecuador\u2019s violation of the BIT. At the same time, Murphy Ecuador was entitled to claim for losses under Ecuadorian law for any breach of the Participation Contract to which it was a party.\n\n357.\n\nThe fact that both Murphy and Murphy Ecuador held entitlements against Ecuador under the Treaty and the Participation Contract, respectively, did not deprive either entity of its entitlement. They had different legal personalities and their respective rights to claim losses were not mutually exclusive. Their claims emanated from two different instruments and gave rise to different causes of action: Murphy, as a U.S. investor enjoyed standing under the Treaty to bring international law claims against Ecuador, whereas Murphy Ecuador, a party to the Participation Contract, enjoyed standing to bring contractual claims against Petroecuador. Investment arbitration case law recognises that shareholder companies and the companies in which they hold shares have different rights of action against States.604\n\nA shareholder has \"a separate cause of action under the Treaty in connection with the protected investment, [\u2026] which can be asserted independently from the rights of [the company]\". *See* *CMS* Award, para. 68, **CLA-20/RLA-165**. The tribunal in *Hochtief* also recognised two independent causes of action, one under municipal law and another one under treaty law as between the locally incorporated company and the shareholder, respectively. That case involved a settlement by the local company with the State. The tribunal held that since there was no evidence that the claimant\u2019s rights under the BIT were transferred to the local company to take action on its behalf, the claimant retained its standing to bring claims with respect to the treatment of its shareholding under the BIT. *Hochtief* Decision on Liability, para. 168, **CLA-334**.\n\n358.\n\nAs of 18 October 2007, Murphy had standing to claim for losses at international law caused to its investment in Murphy Ecuador by Ecuador\u2019s violation of the BIT.\n\n2. **The effect of clause 12.7 of the SPA**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nOn 12 March 2009, Murphy's first-tier subsidiary, Canam, and Repsol YPF entered into the SPA by which Murphy sold its entire interest in Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF.\n\n360.\n\nAccording to Claimant, clause 12 of the SPA assigned to Murphy \"all of Murphy Ecuador's rights and claims for losses that [Murphy] was pursuing in [the Murphy ICSID Arbitration].\"605 According to Respondent, Claimant sold Murphy Ecuador with all of Murphy Ecuador's rights intact, and when Murphy Ecuador settled its claims in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration under the Repsol Settlement Agreement, those claims were extinguished.606\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 2.\n\n361.\n\nClause 12.7 of the SPA is critical to determining which claims remained with which entity at the time of the sale and which claims survived the Repsol Settlement Agreement and the termination of the ICSID arbitrations. As a preliminary point, the Tribunal notes that the law governing the SPA is that of the State of Texas.607 The Parties' arguments on the interpretation of the SPA, and the validity or effectiveness of the assignment clause contained therein, were not based on Texas law. The only reference made to Texas law was Respondent's argument that, under Texas law, there was a \"re-conveyance\" of rights to Murphy Ecuador once the Murphy ICSID Arbitration was concluded.608 In the Tribunal's view, Texas law is not relevant to its analysis because municipal law in an international law context is treated as a fact.609 The Tribunal approaches its analysis of whether an assignment took place under the SPA as a factual one.\n\nSPA, cl. 16.1, **CEX-127**.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 123; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 42. *See infra* paras. 371, 382.\n\nDorr and Schmalenbach, p. 824: \"With regard to the principle *iura novit curia,* municipal law is generally not considered \u2018law' before international courts but rather a \u2018fact' which must be presented and proven by parties;\" *AES Summit* Award, para. 7.6.6, **CLA-67** : \"It is common ground that in an international arbitration, national laws are to be considered as facts;\" *Thunderbird* Award, para. 127, **RLA-314** : \"The international law disciplines of Articles 1102, 1105 and 1110 in particular only assess whether Mexican regulatory and administrative conduct breach these specific disciplines. The perspective is of an international law obligation examining national conduct as a \u2018fact'.\"\n\n362.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to an examination of clause 12.7 of the SPA. It shall address each provision in turn.\n\nClause 12.7.1 of the SPA\n------------------------\n\n363.\n\nClause 12.7.1 of the SPA provides:\n\nPurchaser acknowledges and agrees that Murphy Exploration & Production Company - International, an Affiliate of Seller (\"MEPCI\"), shall retain, and shall prosecute in its sole discretion, all the claims it may have against Ecuador for violation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Ecuador and the United States, including the claims made in the current ICSID arbitration that MEPCI has initiated against Ecuador (the \"Arbitration\"). The Arbitration involves claims, among others, for the diminution in value of MEPCI\u2019s investment in Ecuador through the Company.\n\n364.\n\nIn clause 12.7.1, Repsol acknowledged and agreed that Murphy would retain and prosecute all Treaty claims, including those claims made in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration. This clause indicates that *all possible Treaty claims* were retained by Murphy, not just those claims submitted by Murphy in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration at that time.\n\nClause 12.7.2 of the SPA\n------------------------\n\n365.\n\nClause 12.7.2 provides:\n\nPurchaser further acknowledges that the claims that are the subject matter of the Arbitration are \"investor\" claims properly vested and owned by MEPCI and not \"Company\" claims vested or retained by Company. All rights, privileges, and future awards arising from the Arbitration are retained by MEPCI. Purchaser hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right or claim whatsoever to the rights, privileges and future awards arising from the Arbitration.\n\n366.\n\nRespondent argues that the distinction that is drawn in clause 12.7.2 between \"investor\" claims and \"Company\" claims shows that Murphy Ecuador *retained* the claims that it had against Ecuador, as well as the right to settle those claims.610 Claimant argues that by waiving its right to any future awards arising from the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, Repsol YPF\u2014in its capacity as Murphy Ecuador\u2019s new owner\u2014relinquished any possibility of receiving any compensation for Murphy Ecuador\u2019s losses. As such, Murphy alone had the right to prosecute and eventually collect any compensation from Ecuador for those losses.611\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 5.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 25, 17.\n\n367.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that in clause 12.7.2, Repsol acknowledged that the claims that were the subject matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration were \"investor\" claims vested and owned by Murphy (not Murphy Ecuador), and not \"Company\" claims vested or retained by Murphy Ecuador. Repsol also acknowledged that any rights, privileges and future awards arising from the Murphy ICSID Arbitration were retained by Murphy. It irrevocably and unconditionally waived any right or claim in regard to such rights, privileges and any future awards.612 By this clause, the Tribunal finds that Repsol acknowledged that Murphy had standing to bring \"investor\" claims under the Treaty with respect to rights held by its investment, Murphy Ecuador, under the Participation Contract.\n\nThe SPA defines claims as \"any claim, demand, cause of action, chose in action, right of recovery or right of set-off of whatever kind or description against any Person.\" It does not define \"right\" or \"privilege\".\n\n368.\n\nThis reflects also the Tribunal's conclusion that Murphy was entitled to claim under the Treaty for Murphy Ecuador's losses at the time of sale. Murphy Ecuador was Murphy's protected investment. Murphy was therefore entitled to bring claims under the Treaty for losses caused by Ecuador's Treaty violations to its investment. It was not necessary for Murphy Ecuador's rights and privileges to be assigned to Murphy for Murphy to enjoy standing or an entitlement to claim for Murphy Ecuador's losses.\n\nClause 12.7.3 of the SPA\n------------------------\n\n369.\n\nNotwithstanding the acknowledgement of Murphy's standing contained in clause 12.7.2, the parties to the SPA included an assignment clause ostensibly to put the matter beyond doubt. Clause 12.7.3 provides as follows:\n\nTo the extent that certain rights or privileges of Company are required to be held by MEPCI in the process of prosecuting the Arbitration or collecting any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal, Purchaser and its Affiliates, predecessors, successors in interest and interrelated companies, employees, officers, directors, agents, attorneys and other representatives, do hereby assign to MEPCI all rights and privileges of the Company which are the subject matter of the Arbitration, including but not limited to (i) claims to money or claims to performance having economic value and (ii) any rights conferred by Law of contract. For the avoidance of doubt, the assignment of rights and privileges set forth in this Clause 12.7.3 shall be limited to safeguarding the due and punctual prosecution of the Arbitration and the collection of any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal in favor of MEPCI and shall not confer any monetary rights or performance rights which do not form part of the subject matter of the Arbitration.\n\n370.\n\nMurphy contends that this clause assigned to Murphy all of Murphy Ecuador's rights to claim for the losses that Murphy was already claiming in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.613 In other words, clause 12.7.3 ensured that Murphy\u2014not Murphy Ecuador or Repsol YPF\u2014would receive any compensation for the losses under the Participation Contract.614\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 27.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 27.\n\n371.\n\nRespondent argues that the purported assignment was not valid or effective because it (a) was the subject of a condition precedent that never materialised; and (b) was not authorised as required under the Participation Contract and the Hydrocarbons Law of Ecuador.615 Even if clause 12.7.3 was a valid and effective assignment, Respondent argues that (c) the assigned rights could not have included Murphy Ecuador\u2019s right to receive cash flows under the Participation Contract because no such right was the subject of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration; and (d) the rights were re-conveyed to Murphy Ecuador when the Murphy ICSID Arbitration concluded.616 Respondent considers that Murphy Ecuador was entitled to settle the claims it had asserted in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration. In light of the Repsol Settlement Agreement, Respondent\u2019s view is that there are no remaining rights belonging to Murphy Ecuador that Claimant can hold under clause 12.7.3.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 6.\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 7; Claimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 31 *referring to* Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 116; Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 166 and n. 266.\n\n372.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that clause 12.7.3 contains a valid and effective assignment by Repsol to Murphy of all rights and privileges of Murphy Ecuador which were the subject matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration to the extent that they were required to be held by Murphy in the process of prosecuting the Murphy ICSID Arbitration or collecting any awards therefrom. The rights and privileges of Murphy Ecuador which were the subject matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration included Murphy Ecuador\u2019s right of ownership over its share of oil production,617 and the immutability of the Participation Contract except by agreement of the contracting parties.618\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v.

Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Claimant\u2019s Memorial on the Merits, paras. 121-129, **REX-135**.\n\n373.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find that clause 12.7.3 was a conditional assignment. The Tribunal accepts that it was included in the SPA out of an abundance of caution because the case-law on the point\u2014 *i.e.*, the extent to which certain rights or privileges of Murphy Ecuador were required to be held by Murphy for the purposes of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration\u2014was unclear at the time.619 Clause 12.7.3 confirmed that to the extent that certain rights and privileges of Murphy Ecuador were required to be held by Murphy for the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, they were so assigned. This language did not create a condition to be fulfilled for the assignment to be effective; rather, this language provided a pre-emptive clarification and confirmation as to the scope and subject-matter of the assignment in case of future doubt.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 4 and 8.\n\n374.\n\nRespondent argues that the assignment was invalid because Ecuador did not authorise it in advance as required by Article 16.1 of the Participation Contract and Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law.620 Claimant submits that the assignment did not require Ecuador's approval; authorisation was required for *contractual rights* under the Participation Contract but not for *claims* arising out of violations of the Participating Contract.621\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 15-16; Respondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 15; Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 116; Statement of Defense and Reply on Jursidiction, para. 166 at n. 266.\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 32-37; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 17-19.\n\n375.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Article 79 of the Hydrocarbons Law requires governmental authorisation for the \"transfer of a contract or the assignment to third parties of rights arising out of a contract.\"622 Relatedly, Article 7 of Decree No. 1363 requires authorisation for the \"transfer or assignment of rights.\"623 Clause 16.1 of the Participation Contract requires authorisation for the \"transfer of this Contract or the assignment to third Parties of the rights arising therefrom.\"624\n\nHydrocarbons Law, art, 17, **CEX-21**.\n\nExecutive Decree No. 1363, *Official Gazette* No. 293, (27 March 2011).

The assignment only related to rights and privileges held by Murphy Ecuador which formed part of the subject matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration (and only to the extent they were needed for prosecuting the Murphy ICSID Arbitration). Clause 12.7.3 expressly did not \"confer any monetary rights or performance rights which [did] not form part of the subject matter of the [Murphy ICSID] Arbitration.\" Clause 12.7.3 was strictly limited to safeguarding Murphy's prosecution of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.\n\n377.\n\nClaimant argues that even if there was no authorisation, Ecuador acquiesced in the assignment. Claimant says that Ecuador became aware of the assignment from at least 30 April 2009, the date on which Claimant submitted a copy of its memorial on the merits in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration to which the SPA was attached.625 Claimant argues that Ecuador's subsequent failure to object indicates that it acquiesced in the assignment. Respondent submits that it never considered that any rights or privileges of Murphy Ecuador had been effectively transferred through clause 12.7.3 of the SPA. In support of this point, Respondent relies on footnote 106 of its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction filed in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration on 15 August 2009, which states:\n\n[...] Although clause 12.7.3 of the SPA assigns to Claimant Murphy \u2014 \"[t]o the extent that certain rights or privileges of Company [Murphy Ecuador] are required to be held by [Murphy International] in the process of prosecuting the Arbitration or collecting any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal\" - \"all rights and privileges of the Company [Murphy Ecuador] which are the subject matter\" of the instant arbitration, \"including but not limited to (i) claims to money or claims to performance having economic value and (ii) any rights conferred by Law or contract,\" it also limits said assignment of rights providing: \"For the avoidance of doubt, the assignment of rights and privileges set forth in this Clause 12.7.3 shall be limited to safeguarding the due and punctual prosecution of the Arbitration and the collection of any awards rendered by the arbitral tribunal in favor of [Murphy International] and shall not confer any monetary rights or performance rights which do not form part of the subject matter of the Arbitration.\" Id. (emphasis added). In other words, cutting through the circular and deliberately opaque language of the SPA, the underlying principle of the SPA deal is arguably that Murphy Ecuador has retained all rights it has to recover from the Republic of Ecuador for any alleged loss it claims it suffered due to any alleged payments made by it under Law 42 which are the subject matter of the Repsol/Murphy Ecuador arbitration which is currently pending.626\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction submitted in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, fn. 106, **RLA-11** (emphasis added).\n\n378.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find that this is an objection to the assignment in clause 12.7.3. In fact, in the footnote, Respondent first *confirms* the terms of the assignment as stated in clause 12.7.3. Respondent then submits that the underlying principle of the SPA is \"arguably\" that Murphy Ecuador retains all rights for any alleged loss it claims with respect to the Law 42 payments currently pending in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration.\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Ecuador acquiesced in the assignment of the historical Law 42 claims by Murphy Ecuador to Murphy. It also finds that Ecuador, having knowledge of the SPA from at least 30 April 2009, acquiesced in the assignment of all other rights and privileges held by Murphy Ecuador that were the subject-matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration to the extent they were required to be held by Murphy for the prosecution of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.\n\n380.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that on 19 December 2009, Ecuador was notified that Murphy Ecuador\u2019s claims for damages based on historical Law 42 payments were withdrawn from the Repsol ICSID Arbitration because they were being claimed by Murphy in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.627 There is no indication before this Tribunal that Ecuador objected to the carve-out of these claims from the Repsol ICSID Arbitration. The Tribunal finds therefore that, quite apart from the question of whether footnote 106 should be construed as an objection by Ecuador to the assignment of Murphy Ecuador's right to claim for historical Law 42 payments, Ecuador acquiesced to the withdrawal of those claims from the Repsol ICSID Arbitration for inclusion in Murphy's ICSID Arbitration.\n\nRepsol's Memorial, para. 282, **REX-20** : \"[\u2026] payments by [Murphy Ecuador] before being acquired by Repsol YPF have been subtracted from the payments made by the Contractor, because those payments are being claimed by [Murphy] in the [ICSID Arbitration] - this means a reduction in the amount claimed in this arbitration equivalent to 20 percent of the amount paid by the Contractor\", unofficial translation provided by the Tribunal; original in Spanish. *See also* Response to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 158; Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 205; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 53-58.\n\n381.\n\nFurther, and more importantly, the Tribunal finds that, as a result of the withdrawal of Murphy Ecuador's claims for historical Law 42 payments from the Repsol ICSID Arbitration, there is no doubt that they were not settled by the Repsol Settlement Agreement. Those claims remain unsettled and unsatisfied. Consequently, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent's argument that there exists a risk of double-recovery or double jeopardy as regards those claims. Murphy remains entitled to seek compensation for loss it suffered through its indirect investment in Murphy Ecuador as a result of those payments.\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to two final points raised by Respondend as concerns the assignment of the right to receive cash flows under the Participation Contract. Respondent argues that the assigned rights could not have included Murphy Ecuador's right to receive cash flows under the Participation Contract because no such right was the subject of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration.628 It also argues that those rights were \"re-conveyed\" to Murphy Ecuador when the Murphy ICSID Arbitration concluded.629\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 7; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 31 *referring to* Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 116; Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 166 and n. 266.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 120.\n\n383.\n\nThe Tribunal is not convinced by either of Respondent's arguments. The overall purpose of clause 12.7 was to ensure Murphy's ability to pursue *all* Treaty claims\u2014which included but was not limited to the ICSID claims\u2014without obstruction by the sale of its interest in Murphy Ecuador to Repsol. The SPA provided that: \"[Murphy], shall retain, and shall prosecute in its sole discretion, *all the claims* it may have against Ecuador for violation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between Ecuador and the United States, including the claims made in the current ICSID arbitration that [Murphy] has initiated against Ecuador\".\n\n384.\n\nAt the time that the SPA was concluded, the Murphy ICSID Arbitration was the only pending and relevant proceeding for Murphy\u2019s claims under the Treaty. The Tribunal determines that to restrict the assignment in clause 12.7.3 to claims as they were formulated in the then pending ICSID Arbitration would be to undermine the overall purpose of clause 12.7 of the SPA. Clause 12.7 was designed to ensure that Murphy owned any rights and privileges that were necessary for it to pursue all Treaty claims, including through an assignment if necessary (the Tribunal does not think that an assignment was necessary). Clause 12.7.3 only referred to the Murphy ICSID Arbitration because that was the arbitration that was pending *at the time*. The Murphy ICSID Arbitration concluded on 15 December 2010 (one month after the Repsol Settlement Agreement) with a majority award declining jurisdiction.630 As a result, the merits of Murphy\u2019s Treaty claims were never determined in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration and thus survived that proceeding.\n\n*Murphy* ICSID Award, **CEX-3**.\n\n385.\n\nThe Tribunal also rejects Respondent\u2019s claim that the rights were \"re-conveyed\" to Murphy Ecuador after the conclusion of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration. The SPA does not provide for Murphy Ecuador\u2019s rights to be \"re-conveyed\" to Murphy Ecuador. In the absence of such language, the Tribunal is not convinced that those rights were so \"re-conveyed\".\n\nClause 12.7.4 of the SPA\n------------------------\n\n386.\n\nClause 12.7.4 of the SPA provides as follows:\n\nPurchaser agrees not to act against MEPCI\u2019s interest in connection with MEPCI\u2019s claims in the Arbitration. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser\u2019s agreement after the Closing Date to in any way amend the Operations Contracts, or a decision by any member of the Repsol YPF S.A. group of companies after the Closing Date to settle or dismiss any arbitration claim against the GOE, shall not be deemed to be an act against MEPCI\u2019s interest for purposes of this Clause 12.7.4.\n\n387.\n\nClause 12.7.4 of the SPA contains an undertaking by Repsol not to act against Murphy\u2019s interests in connection with Murphy\u2019s claims in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration. The clause does not specify what actions would be considered as \"against\" Murphy\u2019s interest. It does, however, specify certain actions that would *not* be considered as \"against\" Murphy\u2019s interest in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, *e.g.*, the settlement of any arbitration claim against Ecuador by any member of the Repsol group.\n\n388.\n\nThe Tribunal interprets this clause as ensuring Repsol's freedom to settle any arbitration claim that it or any member of its group of companies had against Ecuador that did not overlap with any of Murphy's Treaty claims. If that were not the case, Murphy Ecuador would have been able to settle claims for the same losses that Murphy was pursuing in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, which would have inherently been \"against\" Murphy's interests.\n\nClause 12.7.5 of the SPA\n------------------------\n\n389.\n\nClause 12.7.5 provides:\n\nThe Seller agrees to reimburse, indemnify and hold the Purchaser and its Affiliates harmless from any damage, loss or expense resulting from an award in the Arbitration.\n\n390.\n\nAccording to Claimant, its indemnity to Repsol in clause 12.7.5 only makes sense under an arrangement in which Repsol did not acquire Murphy Ecuador intact.631 Respondent submits that clause 12.7.5 confirms that after the sale, Murphy Ecuador continued to hold its Participation Contract claims: \"if [Murphy] prevailed in its ICSID arbitration and if Ecuador relied on this fact to prevent Murphy Ecuador from pursuing its own claims in the [Repsol ICSID Arbitration], or from settling those claims in exchange for new contractual rights, [Murphy] would be bound to \u2018reimburse, indemnify and hold [it] harmless.'\"632\n\nClaimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 11.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 9.\n\n391.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that clause 12.7.5 is not probative of whether Repsol bought Murphy Ecuador with its Participation Contract claims intact. An indemnity clause from Murphy to Repsol is feasible in both scenarios.\n\nConclusions\n-----------\n\n392.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that:\n\n(i) Following Murphy's exit from the Consortium through its sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF, Murphy was entitled to bring claims under the Treaty for losses to Murphy Ecuador caused by Ecuador's Treaty violations;\n\n(ii) It was not necessary for Murphy Ecuador\u2019s rights and privileges to be assigned to Murphy for Murphy to bring a claim for losses to Murphy Ecuador caused by Ecuador\u2019s Treaty violations;\n\n(iii) But, if an assignment had been necessary, clause 12.7.3 of the SPA contained a valid and effective assignment by Repsol YPF to Murphy of all rights and privileges of Murphy Ecuador which were the subject matter of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration to the extent that they were required to be held by Murphy in the process of prosecuting the Murphy ICSID Arbitration or collecting any awards therefrom; and,\n\n(iv) As a result of the withdrawal of Murphy Ecuador\u2019s claims for historical Law 42 payments from the Repsol ICSID Arbitration, those claims were never settled by the Repsol Settlement Agreement.\n\n3. **What claims were pursued in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration and what claims were settled by the Repsol Settlement Agreement?**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nOn 9 June 2008, the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, commenced an ICSID arbitration against Ecuador, referred to herein as the Repsol ICSID Arbitration.633 Murphy Ecuador and the other Block 16 Consortium members sued Ecuador under the Participation Contract and, in the alternative, Repsol sued Ecuador under the Spain-Ecuador BIT.\n\n*See supra* para. 97.\n\n394.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined the claimants\u2019 request for arbitration and main memorial filed in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration prior to its withdrawal.\n\nRepsol\u2019s Request for Arbitration Dated 9 June 2008\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration, the Consortium sought the following orders from the tribunal: (i) that Petroecuador and Ecuador comply with the Participation Contract in accordance with its original terms, *i.e*., the terms that prevented Petroecuador and Ecuador from requesting Law 42 payments; (ii) alternatively, were the tribunal to consider that the State\u2019s additional participation was a tax, that it be awarded compensation in accordance with clause 8.6 of the Participation Contract; (iii) reimbursement of past and future Law 42 payments, plus the reimbursement of the loss caused by low-production and the suspension of investments, plus interest; (iv) enforcement of the final and binding Consultor\u2019s decision so as to prevent Petroecuador and Ecuador from requesting another payment (known as \"Glosa\"); and (v) compensation for an increase in a transport rate.634\n\nRepsol's Request for Arbitration and Provisional Measures, para. 75, **REX-25**.\n\n396.\n\nRespondent has asserted in *this* arbitration that in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration the Consortium also claimed for loss of cash flow.635 In support, it refers to paragraphs 119 and 134(iv) of the Repsol Request for Arbitration. An examination of those paragraphs indicates that the purported claim for loss of cash flow is far from clear.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 93, referring to Repsol's Request for Arbitration and Provisional Measures, paras. 119 and 134(iv), **REX-25**.\n\n397.\n\nParagraph 119 of the request for arbitration contains the only express mention of loss of cash flow. It reads, in full:\n\nAt the same time as the requirement for payment of the State's Additional Participation, Ecuador demands investments for the Contractor that are incompatible with its economical possibilities. As such, in fulfilling is obligations under the Participation Contract, the Contractor should allocate to investments USD 7 million, equating 10% of its net profits for the year 2007. In light of the destruction of the Contractor's cash flow due to the imposition of the State's Additional Participation, the Contractor presently lacks funds of its own to make these investments. Ignoring entirely the situation, Ecuador demands said investments under threat of termination of the Participation Contract. In the words of the President of Ecuador:\n\n\"I have already sent a very clear message to the oil companies. I am not going to allow that: either they invest or, well, we will act in accordance with the law. [ ] If they do not keep on investing I will take a different type of measures. [ ] For each field that those transnationals have, there are 500 transnationals interested.\"636\n\nRepsol's Request for Arbitration and Provisional Measures, para. 119, **REX-25**, (emphasis added), unofficial translation provided by the Tribunal; original in Spanish:  \n En forma paralela a la exigencia del pago de la Participacion Adicional del Estado, Ecuador exige de la Contratista inversiones incompatibles con sus posibilidades economicas. Asi, en cumplimiento de sus obligaciones bajo el Contrato de Participacion, la Contratista deberia destinar U$S 7 millones, equivalentes al 10% de las utilidades netas del ano 2007, a inversiones. En vista de la destruction del flujo de caja de la Contratista por la imposicion de la Participacion Adicional del Estado, esta carece hoy de fondos propios para realizar esas inversiones. Ignorando por completo esta situacion, Ecuador exige dichas inversiones bajo amenaza de caducidad del Contrato de Participacion. En las palabras del Presidente de Ecuador:  \n\"Ya les he mandado un mensaje muy claro a las petroleras. No voy a permitir eso: o invierten o, bueno, actuaremos conforme a derecho. [ ] Si no me siguen invirtiendo tomare otra clase de medidas. [ ] Por cada campo que tienen esas transnacionales, hay 500 transnacionales interesadas.\"\n\n398.\n\nParagraph 134(iv) reads:\n\nOn the basis of what has been expressed in the present Request, and with an express reservation of the right to expand the present request for relief, including the right to amend in light of new measures adopted by Ecuador or Petroecuador, the Claimants respectfully request that the Tribunal:\n\n(iv) ORDER the Respondents to pay the damages for the violation of the Participation Contract in an amount to be calculated at a later stage of this arbitration, including, but not limited to, the losses caused by each of the established violations.637\n\nRepsol\u2019s Request for Arbitration and Provisional Measures, para. 134(iv), **REX-25** ; unofficial translation provided by the Tribunal; original in Spanish:  \n Con base en lo expuesto en 1a presente Solicitud, y con expresa reserva del derecho de ampliar el presente petitorio, incluyendo el derecho de ampliar a la luz de nuevas medidas adoptadas por Ecuador o Petroecuador, las Demandantes respetuosamente solicitan al Tribunal que:  \n (iv) ORDENE a las Demandadas pagar los danos y perjuicios por la violacion del Contrato de Participacion en un monto a ser calculado en una fase posterior de este arbitraje, inc1uyendo, pero no limitado, a las perdidas causadas por cada una de las violaciones establecidas.\n\n399.\n\nParagraphs 74 and 75(iii) are also related. They state:\n\n74. In light of the foregoing, the Claimants are legitimized to demand from Petroecuador and Ecuador the fulfilment of their obligations under the Participation Contract as they were originally agreed and a compensation for the damages suffered.\n\n75. In the present dispute, this implies:\n\n(iii) Additionally, the claimants are legitimized to claim, and they do so, compensation for the damages suffered due to the contractual breach, including but not limited to, the reimbursement of the amounts paid as the State\u2019s Additional Participation and the amounts that for such concept they pay in the future in order to avoid the termination of the Participation Contract, the equivalent to the losses caused by the decrease in production and the suspension of investments, with the corresponding interest.638\n\nRepsol\u2019s Request for Arbitration and Provisional Measures, paras. 74-75(iii), **REX-25** ; unofficial translation provided by the Tribunal;Original in Spanish:  \n 74. En vistas de lo anterior, las Demandantes se encuentran legitimadas para exigir de Petroecuador y Ecuador el cumplimiento de sus obligaciones bajo el Contrato de Participacion tal como fueron originariamente pactadas y una indemnizacion por los perjuicios sufridos.  \n 75. En la presente disputa, ello implica:  \n (iii) Adicionalmente, las Demandantes se encuentran legitimadas a reclamar, y reclaman, compensacion de los perjuicios sufridos por el incumplimiento contractual, incluyendo pero sin limitarse a la devolucion de los montos abonados en concepto de Participacion Adicional del Estado y los pagos que por tal concepto realice en el futuro a fin de evitar la caducidad del Contrato de Participacion, el equivalente a las perdidas causadas por las bajas en la produccion y la suspension de inversiones, con los intereses correspondientes.\n\n400.\n\nThe principal head of claim in the request for arbitration was for Law 42 payments, past and future. A portion of these claims was also being pursued in parallel by Murphy in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration. At that time, Murphy still owned Murphy Ecuador,\n\nRepsol's Memorial Dated 17 December 2009\n----------------------------------------\n\n401.\n\nThe Consortium filed its main memorial in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration on 17 December 2009.639 This was approximately nine months after the sale of Murphy Ecuador. In the memorial, the Consortium carved out from its damages claim the amounts claimed by Murphy in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration for Murphy Ecuador's Law 42 payments made before 12 March 2009:\n\nFirst, payments by [Murphy Ecuador] before being acquired by Repsol YPF have been subtracted from the payments made by the Contractor, because those payments are being claimed by [Murphy] in the [ICSID Arbitration] - this means a reduction in the amount claimed in this arbitration equivalent to 20 percent of the amount paid by the Contractor.640\n\nRepsol's Memorial, **REX-20**.\n\nRepsol's Memorial, para. 282, **REX-20**, unofficial translation provided by the Tribunal; original in Spanish:\n\nEn primer lugar, a los pagos realizados por la Contratista se han descontado los pagos realizados por Murphy antes de ser adquirida por Repsol YPF, puesto que dichos pagos estan siendo reclamados por Murphy Exploration and Production Company International en el arbitraje Murphy Exploration and Production Company International c. Republica del Ecuador (Caso ICSID No. ARB/08/4) - esto supone una reduccion en el monto reclamado en este arbitraje equivalente al 20 por ciento sobre lo pagado por la Contratista.\n\n*See also* Response to Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 158; Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 205; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 53-58.\n\n402.\n\nAs mentioned, the Repsol ICSID Arbitration involved the Consortium's contract claims under the Participation Contract and, in the alternative, Repsol's treaty claims under the Spain-Ecuador BIT. Section III of the memorial addressed the contract claims and Section IV addressed the treaty claims.\n\n403.\n\nSection III.C of the memorial dealt with the claimants' right to compensation for damages under the Participation Contract. It referred solely to damages for payments under Law 42. In it, the claimants submitted that the Ecuadorean Civil Code was the applicable law and that, with regard to compensation for damages, pursuant to Article 1572 of the Code, the contractor had a right to be compensated for *damnum emergens* (actual loss) and also for *lucrum cessans* (loss of profits).641 In the following paragraph, the memorial stated that \"[i]n the present case, the Claimants claim the actual loss, which is constituted by all the amounts already paid by the Contractor as State\u2019s Additional Participation.\"642\n\nRepsol\u2019s Memorial, para. 280, **REX-20**.\n\nRepsol\u2019s Memorial, para. 281 (emphasis added), **REX-20**, unoffical translation provided by the Tribunal; original in Spanish:  \n En el presente caso, las Demandantes reclaman el dano emergente que esta constituido por todos los montos ya pagados por la Contratista por concepto de Participacion Adicional del Estado.\n\n404.\n\nThe claimants in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration were only claiming actual loss, even though they had submitted that under Article 1572 of the Ecuadorean Civil Code they could also claim loss of profit.\n\n405.\n\nLater in the memorial, the claimants specified that the damage they claimed included the payments made under the concept of actual loss between 2006 and 2008, as well as the payments made (and those that may be made in the future) under the Disbursement Agreement, plus interest.643\n\nRepsol\u2019s Memorial, para. 281, **REX-20** ; *see also supra* para. 110.\n\n406.\n\nIn the memorial\u2019s request for relief section, the claimants requested that the tribunal: declare that Ecuador and Petroecuador are jointly and severally liable for the payment of compensation for damages arising out of Ecuador\u2019s breaches of the Participation Contract (paragraph 377(c)); order the respondents to compensate them in an amount to be updated as necessary (paragraph 377(d)); and, grant the claimants any other satisfaction the tribunal deemed pertinent (paragraph 377(d)). In the alternative, Repsol requested that the tribunal order that Ecuador compensate Repsol for the damages suffered as a result of Ecuador\u2019s violations of the Spain-Ecuador treaty, in an amount to be updated based on the future Law 42 payments to be made by Repsol (paragraph 378(c)); and grant Repsol any other satisfaction the tribunal deemed pertinent (paragraph 378(d)).\n\n407.\n\nThe language used in the request for relief section is general. There is no express reference to loss of cash flow or loss of profit. Express reference is only made to Law 42 payments. While paragraph 377(c) could arguably capture a loss of cash flow or loss of profit claim, notably, there is no mention of loss of cash flow or loss of profit in all of section III.C (which addresses Murphy Ecuador\u2019s claims).644\n\nSection IV of Repsol\u2019s Memorial addressed Repsol\u2019s BIT claims, subsection C of which sets out the damages it claims for treaty violations. That section refers back to the section on damages for Participation Contract violations (paragraph 373). The only difference is that the treaty claims only correspond to Repsol, and, from March 2009, also to Murphy Ecuador's successor, Amodaimi Oil.\n\n408.\n\nThus, the only express reference to loss of cash flow is in the request for arbitration. When examined in context, that reference merely describes the Consortium's difficulty in satisfying the obligations to simultaneously make Law 42 payments and to continue to invest, rather than as a head of claim in and of itself. Apart from that (and arguably the passing reference to *lucrum cessans* in the memorial), there is no evidence before this Tribunal that loss of cash flow was a separate head of claim pursued in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration. The request for relief in the memorial was not subsequently expanded beyond the Law 42 payments claim. There is no indication that the claimants filed an expert report on quantum in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration.\n\nThe Repsol Settlement Agreement\n-------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nOn 23 November 2010, the members of the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, entered into the Repsol Settlement Agreement with Ecuador, which provided the following:645\n\nSettlement and withdrawal from Arbitration.\n\nAs a consequence of the agreement detailed in these Minutes of Negotiation -Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A., Amodaimi Oil Company Ltd. [formerly Murphy Ecuador], CRS Resources (Ecuador) LDC and Overseas Petroleum and Investment Corporation, and once the Contract Modifying the Service [Contract] has been signed and is in effect, the companies and the Secretariat as well as the Republic of Ecuador shall give written notice of this agreement to the Arbitral Tribunal hearing the proceedings designated as ICSID Case No. ARB/08/10 so that the Tribunal may proceed in accordance with the provisions of Rule 43(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n[...]\n\nThe Parties agree and confirm that all claims, counter-claims, demands, counterdemands, and requests contained in the Request for Arbitration, Statement of Claim, Memorial on Jurisdiction, Counter-Memorial, and any other communication sent by the Parties as a consequence of the Arbitration or submitted by the Tribunal or by ICSID, as well as any other correspondence to third-parties related to the arbitration shall be withdrawn with prejudice and shall be kept confidential, such that under no circumstances, shall any of the Parties disclose [them] without the prior consent of the other Party.646\n\nRepsol Settlement Agreement, **REX-21**.\n\nRepsol Settlement Agreement, p. 14, **REX-21**.\n\n410.\n\nOn the same date, the members of the Consortium, including Murphy Ecuador, entered into the Final Modification Contract.647 Article 29.1.2 provided that:\n\nIt shall be understood that in entering into the [Final] Modification Contract, Contractor irrevocably waives all claims or demands or losses that it could raise against Ecuador, the Secretariat, EP PETROECUADOR and/or any of their predecessors, under any legislation, in connection with or as a result of the Original Contract, the Previous Modification Contracts and the execution and entry into force of the present [Final] Modification Contract.648\n\nFinal Modification Contract, **CEX-175/REX-116**.\n\nFinal Modification Contract, pp. 106-107 (Spanish version), **CEX-175/REX-116**.\n\n411.\n\nArticle 29.1.3 provided that:\n\nContractor acknowledges [to] Ecuador [\u2026] that [\u2026] neither the Contractor nor its related companies are owed anything by, nor do they, by any means, have anything to claim therefrom, directly or indirectly, in connection with the Original Contract and any of its previous Amendment Contracts, whether due to missed opportunities, *damnus emergens* or *lucrum cessans*.649\n\nFinal Modification Contract, pp. 106-107 (Spanish version), **CEX-175/REX-116**.\n\n412.\n\nArticle 29.1.5 of the Final Modification Contract provided that:\n\nThe Parties agree and confirm that all demands, counter-demands, claims, counterclaims and requests, contained in the Request for Arbitration, Memorial on the Merits, Memorial on Jurisdiction, Counter-Memorial, and any other communication sent by the Parties as a consequence of the Arbitration or sent by the Tribunal, or as a result of Case [ *sic* ] International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), as well as any other correspondence to third-parties related to the arbitration shall be withdrawn with prejudice [\u2026]650\n\nFinal Modification Contract, pp. 108-109 (Spanish version), **CEX-175/REX-116**.\n\n413.\n\nWith the execution of the Final Modification Contract, the claims brought in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration were withdrawn and definitively settled. For the sake of clarity, claims *not* raised in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration were neither withdrawn nor settled; they remained alive.\n\n414.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that:\n\n(i) Murphy Ecuador did not pursue a claim for loss of cash flow in the Repsol ICSID Arbitration;\n\n(ii) Consequently, no claim by Murphy Ecuador for loss of cash flow was ever settled by the Repsol Settlement Agreement.\n\n**IX.

Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n416.\n\nClaimant submits that the standard of compensation should be determined by *lex specialis* or, in the absence of such, by customary international law.653 It notes that the only *lex specialis* standard in the BIT is Article III(1), which sets out the conditions for a lawful expropriation and that the Treaty does not define the standard of compensation for other Treaty violations.654\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 440, *referring to Amoco International Finance Corporation v. Islamic Republic of Iran*, Iran-United States Claims Tribunal, Partial Award, 14 July 1987, para. 112, **CLA-103** (\" ***Amoco*** **Partial Award** \").\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 440-441; Reply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 749.\n\n417.\n\nClaimant contends therefore that customary international law sets the standard of compensation in this case. It refers specifically to the *Chorzow Factory* case655 where the Permanent Court of International Justice (\" **PCIJ** \") held that an aggrieved claimant is entitled to compensation that wipes out the consequences of the State's unlawful act and re-establishes the situation that would have existed had the act not been committed.656 Claimant maintains that investment tribunals have repeatedly applied this standard, including where the treaty breach is other than unlawful expropriation.657\n\n*Chorzow Factory,* p. 47, **CLA-86**.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 443-444, *referring to* *MTD* Award, para. 238, **CLA-42**.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 445-446, *referring to the* *Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. v.

Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n419.\n\nIt is Respondent\u2019s case that Article III(1) of the BIT only applies to expropriation. With respect to Claimant\u2019s non-expropriation claims, Respondent argues that the standard of compensation is the actual loss Claimant itself incurred as a result of the wrongful acts.660 In support of its position, Respondent cites several cases, including *Feldman v. Mexico*, *S.D. Myers v. Canada*, *LG&E v. Argentina*, *MTD v. Chile*, as well as the ILC Commentary.661 Respondent submits that some of the cases Claimant relies on actually support Respondent\u2019s position if read comprehensively.662\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 928, 971-981; Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 625-627; *See also* Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 372:4 to 380:6.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 972-974, *referring to* *Feldman* Award, para. 194, **RLA-30** ; *S.D.

This may include the loss of the value of the shares, but is not tantamount to the losses suffered by the subsidiary through which the investment is held.663 Respondent argues that Claimant claims for the losses of Murphy Ecuador, which were already compensated through Murphy Ecuador's settlement with Ecuador.664\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 977-981, referring to *Nykomb Synergetics Technology Holding AB v. The Republic of Latvia*, SCC, Arbitral Award, 16 December 2003, p. 39, para. 5.2(a), **RLA-298** ; *ST-AD Award on Jurisdiction*, para. 282, **RLA-393** ; and *Azurix* Award, para. 431, **CLA-10**.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 627; Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 928, 971-981. *See also* Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 372:4 to 380:6.\n\n421.\n\nIn sum, Respondent contends that in the present case, the relevant standard of compensation is the actual loss caused to Murphy's financial position as indirect shareholder of Murphy Ecuador and that this loss cannot be considered legally identical to the harm, if any, incurred by Murphy Ecuador.665\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 981.\n\n***C. Analysis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties that it is not bound by Article III(1) of the BIT in its determination of the appropriate standard of compensation in the present case. Article III(1) only applies to cases of lawful expropriation, but is silent on cases unrelated to expropriation. In particular, the Tribunal notes that the Treaty does not address the appropriate standard of compensation in cases involving violations of the FET standard.\n\n423.\n\nIn the absence of explicit rules in the Treaty, Claimant proposes that the standard articulated in the PCIJ *Chorzow Factory* case should govern the issue. Respondent does not dispute the applicability of this standard. The dispute between the Parties centres rather on the question as to whether the standard entails an obligation of full reparation or requires compensation of the actual harm incurred by Claimant.\n\n424.\n\nIn the *Chorzow Factory* case, the PCIJ held that compensation should \"wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that had not been committed.\"666 Under Article 31 of the International law Commission Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\" **ILC Articles on State Responsibility** \"), the applicability of the *Chorzow Factory* standard has been confirmed and broadened in scope beyond the sphere of expropriation.667 Article 31 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility provides:\n\n1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.\n\n2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State. (emphasis added)\n\n*Chorzow Factory*, p. 47, **CLA-86**.\n\n*BP Group* Award, paras. 426-427, **CLA-25**.\n\n425.\n\nThe violation of an obligation under international law by a State entails the State\u2019s international responsibility. The Tribunal is satisfied that the above principle of full reparation applies to breaches of investment treaties unrelated to expropriations. This is reflected in the practice of investment tribunals.668 The full reparation standard aims at \"full reparation\"of the concerete and actual damage incurred.669 It provides a large margin of appreciation to tribunals with respect to the selection of an appropriate valuation method.670 With that in mind, the Tribunal examines Claimant\u2019s heads of claim.\n\n*Vivendi II* Award, para. 8.2.7, **CLA-13/37** ; *AAPL* Award, paras. 87-88, **CLA-61** ; *MTD* Award, para. 238, **CLA-42** ; *Rumeli* Award, para. 792, **CLA-23** ; *Duke Energy* Award, paras. 467-468, **CLA-22** ; *LG&E* Award, para. 31, **CLA-39**.\n\nIrmgard Marboe, *Valuation in Cases of Expropriation*, in Bungenberg, Griebel, Hobe, Reinisch (eds.), INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW (C.H.BECK, Hart, Nomos, 2015), p. 1101 (\" ***Marboe*** \").\n\n*Marboe*, p. 1093.\n\n2. **Restitution of the Law 42 Payments**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n426.\n\nIt is not contested that Murphy Ecuador paid USD 118.3 million in Law 42 payments as additional participation to Ecuador from May 2006 through March 2008.671 The main point of conflict between the Parties is whether or not the amount of historical payments claimed must be decreased to account for income and labour taxes as well as the \"threshold of tolerable proportionality\".672\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 451, *referring to* First Navigant\u2019s Expert Report, para. 68. *See also* Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 165:12 to 166:9; Hearing Transcript (19 Nov. 2014), 516:24 to 519:13; Second Fair Links Expert Report, para. 94.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1031. *See also* Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 380:7-15.\n\n***A. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n427.\n\nClaimant rejects the contention that the USD 118 million payment must be reduced by the applicable taxes.673 To be fully compensated, Claimant says that it should receive the historical Law 42 payments without any tax deductions; such deductions should occur (if at all) post- award.674\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 757 *referring to* Navigant Second Expert Report, paras. 77-85. *See also* Claimant\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 108-148; Claimant\u2019s Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 47, *referring to* First Navigant Expert Report, paras. 97, 112.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 746.\n\n428.\n\nClaimant gives seven reasons for its position. First, a damages claim is a single transaction that may or may not impose a year-end tax liability for the compensated party. Second, the deduction of corporate income taxes from a damages claim poses a risk of double taxation. Third, while corporate income taxes are recognised as a potential result of an entity's transactions for a reporting year, a damages award must be enforced before it can be considered concluded. Fourth, income and labour taxes are to be paid to a tax authority and not \"netted\" out through a damages award. Fifth, tax issues arising from an award should be dealt within the ordinary course of business and not \"netted\" against the damages award. Sixth, the approach Respondent suggests is akin to Murphy amending and re-filing its 2006 to 2008 tax returns to recognise additional income and the corresponding additional tax liability and then paying interest to the tax authority for having understated its taxable income in prior periods. If an award is taxable in Ecuador and if the tax laws of Ecuador require the tax payer, *i.e.* Murphy, to attribute the award as income generated in prior periods rather than income generated in the current period, then Murphy ought to amend and re-file its prior tax returns. Finally, in any event, the SPA transferred all of Murphy Ecuador's tax obligations prior to 2009 to Repsol.675\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 757, *referring* to Navigant Second Report, paras. 7785.\n\n429.\n\nClaimant contends that the additional participation it paid should be brought to present value at a pre-award interest rate based on Ecuador's external borrowing rate in US dollars.676 It sets the preaward interest at USD 238.4 million. This is based on the weighted average yield of Ecuador's global bond, factoring in Ecuador's default in 2008 and bringing each additional participation payment to the expected award date of 1 August 2015, with interest compounded annually.677\n\n*See also* para. 505.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 452-454, *referring to* First Navigant Expert Report, paras. 100-108.\n\n***B. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n430.\n\nRespondent submits that the Tribunal would have to find that Law 42 violated the BIT at both the 50% and 99% rates for it to allow Claimant to recover the full USD 118.3 million requested.678 It argues that a finding of breach at the 50% rate would contradict previous ICSID awards and constitute an undue restraint on a State's liberty to apply legitimate revenue measures.679 Respondent clarifies that, of the USD 118.3 million in Law 42 payments made by Murphy Ecuador, USD 58.9 million was paid at the 50% rate, while USD 59.4 million was paid at 99%.680\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 101, *referring to* Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 993, *which refers to* First Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 103-104.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 101, *referring to* *Perenco* Decision on Jurisdiction and Liability, paras. 601-602 **, RLA-452** :  \n \"601. On the basis of the available record evidence, therefore, the Tribunal considers that in 2006-2007, with the then-prevailing price of Napo and Oriente crude and with Law 42 at 50%, Perenco was still generating significant cash flows and appeared to be quite profitable. 602. In all of the circumstances, therefore, the Tribunal finds that Law 42 per se did not amount to a breach of Article 4 of the Treaty.\"  \n*Burlington* Decision on Liability, para. 433, **CLA-233** : \"These facts corroborate the Tribunal's earlier conclusion that Law 42 at 50% did not substantially deprive Burlington of the value of its investment, and was therefore not a measure tantamount to expropriation\".\n\nRespondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 101, *referring to* First Navigant Expert Report, Exhibit NAV-39.\n\n431.\n\nIt is for this reason that Respondent submits that the amount of compensation for the payments made at 99% should be adjusted by subtracting from it the part attributable to what would have to be considered a lawful taxation measure.681 Applying this reasoning, Respondent argues that the claimed amount of USD 59.4 million paid under Law 42 at the 99% rate needs to be adjusted by subtracting USD 30 million, which is the amount that Murphy would have paid on the USD 60 million of windfall profits under Law 42 at 50%.682 The balance would then have to be further decreased by any additional revenue payments the Tribunal might find acceptable under the BIT. In this regard, Respondent suggests a figure between 50% and 99%, inclusive, arguing that sovereign nations would enjoy significantly greater flexibility in terms of revenue measures and that the Tribunal should find that the permissible figure is greater than 50%.683 This further decrease would result in an additional reduction of up to USD 29.4 million.684\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 996; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para 102.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 643.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, paras. 643, 645.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 643.\n\n432.\n\nRespondent states that, in a next step, the amount of historical payments must then be further decreased by 36.25%, which is the aggregate tax rate that combines the Ecuadorian labour tax (15%) and income tax (25%) that Murphy Ecuador would have paid in the absence of Law 42.685 It asserts that the obligation to pay these taxes, as well as the applicable rules of computation, are provided for in the Participation Contract.686 Respondent submits that Claimant does not dispute this fact and that this approach would be consistent with the most common valuation principles and practices.687\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 644. The computation is as follows: 36.25% *(i.e.,* 15% + (25% x 85%)). *See also* Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 989; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 103; Rejoinder on the Merits, para. 647; Respondent\u2019s Opening Statement, Part VII, Slide 14; Hearing Transcript (19 Nov. 2014), 609:5-16; First Fair Links Export Report, para. 103.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 647, *referring to* cl. 11.2., 11.2.3, 11.2.4 of the Participation Contract, **CEX-36**.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, paras. 646-647, *referring to* Second Fair Links Expert Report, para. 104.\n\n433.\n\nRespondent explains that the application of tax to the damages claim is justified because Claimant should not be awarded more than it would have obtained in the absence of Law 42.688 It notes that the amount of historical payments would have been taxed as additional profit and thus would have been subject to Ecuadorian taxes before they would have been available for distribution in the corporate chain in the form of dividends.689\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 648, *referring to* *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v.

Second, the taxation would not be triggered by the arbitral award, but by the profits Murphy Ecuador might have earned had it not paid levies under Law 42.691\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 651, *referring to* Second Navigant Expert Report, para. 77.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 652.\n\n435.\n\nFor the same reasons, Respondent disagrees with the argument that applying taxes to the amount claimed could result in double taxation.692 The Ecuadorian taxes in question are those due by Murphy Ecuador, not Murphy.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 653, *referring to* Second Navigant Expert Report, para. 78; Second Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 101-103.\n\n436.\n\nRespondent describes Claimant's argument that Ecuadorian labour tax should not be taken into account because the ultimate beneficiaries of the tax are the taxpayer's employees as \"devoid of logic\".693 Even if this were true, Murphy would have no entitlement to receive amounts that correspond with that labour tax absent any link to the employees of its former indirect subsidiary Murphy Ecuador.694\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 653, *referring to* Second Navigant Expert Report, para. 82.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 654.\n\n437.\n\nFinally, Respondent argues that the SPA, which provides that Repsol YPF shall be liable for any Ecuadorian taxes imposed on Murphy Ecuador, should be disregarded, as Ecuador is not a party to the Agreement and therefore is not bound by it.695\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 655, *referring to* Second Navigant Expert Report, para. 85.\n\n438.\n\nIn sum, Respondent asserts that the maximum compensation due Claimant for the historical Law 42 payments made by Murphy Ecuador is no greater than USD 18.74 million (*i.e.*, USD 29.4 million x (100% - 36.25%)).696 While this figure is based on 50% as a tolerable rate for Law 42, Respondent clarifies that States enjoy significant flexibility in terms of revenue measures, which should lead the Tribunal to determine as appropriate a permissible figure greater than 50%.697\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 645; Respondent\u2019s Opening Statement, Part VII, Slide 17; Respondent\u2019s First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 100-104.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 645.\n\n***C. Analysis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nFor the reasons given below, the Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to compensation in the total amount of USD 19,971,309 for historical Law 42 payments.\n\n440.\n\nClaimant claims a total of USD 118.3 million under this head of claim. The Parties do not dispute that this figure represents what Murphy Ecuador paid in historical Law 42 payments as a member of the Consortium when it was owned by Murphy.\n\n441.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that Ecuador violated the Treaty when it enacted Law 42 at 99%. The Tribunal does not consider that Ecuador violated the Treaty when it enacted Law 42 at 50%. The Tribunal finds that therefore Murphy is entitled to compensation for the historical Law 42 payments that Murphy Ecuador made at 99%. Murphy Ecuador paid a total of USD 55,986,233 of payments under Law 42 at 99% for the period November 2007 to March 2008.698 Murphy Ecuador would have paid only USD 28,275,875 over that same period had Law 42 remained at 50%. The Tribunal finds that Murphy is entitled to compensation for the difference between those two amounts, *i.e.*, USD 27,710,358.\n\nSee *supra* para. 88; **NAV-39**, Ecuador Windfall Profit Sharing Cash Call Notes; **Exhibit 4.1** to First Navigant Expert Report, \"Additional Participation Paid\"; First Fair Links Report, **Exhibit 2**, **FL 10** Ecuador Windfall Profit Sharing from Cash Call Notes.\n\n442.\n\nRespondent has argued that the Tribunal is obliged to subtract from the amount of compensation for historical payments the payments the sum of which would represent a lawful revenue measure in the circumstances of the present case.699 The Tribunal determines that it has achieved this by subtracting from the total amount paid under Law 42 at 99% the amount that Claimant would have paid over the same period under Law 42 at 50%. The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to determine any other \"outer tolerable limit\" between 50% and 99% that may justify a further reduction in the amount awarded to Claimant.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 994-996; Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 635, 637-645; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 101.\n\n443.\n\nRespondent submits that if Murphy Ecuador had not made the payments under Law 42, the amounts would have counted as additional profits and thus would have been subject to labour and income taxes in Ecuador.700 Claimant does not dispute this. Respondent argues that to reflect the true but-for scenario, any amount awarded to Murphy as compensation for Law 42 payments should be reduced by labour tax of 15% and income tax of 25% with the aggregate rate of imposition being 36.25% (*i.e.*, 15% + (25% x 85)). It is Respondent's case that the net economic impact of the measures on Murphy Ecuador is what is relevant. Claimant objects to this on a number of grounds as set out above.701\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 103-104.\n\n*See supra* paras. 426-429.\n\n444.\n\nClaimant submits that a damages award is a single transaction that may or may not contribute to a year-end tax liability.702 Nor is it a concluded transaction. This is important, Claimant argues, because corporate income taxes are recognised as a potential, consequential result of an entity's concluded transactions.703 It also contends that to deduct these tax obligations from the award would be like Claimant amending and re-filing its 2006-2008 tax returns to recognise additional income and additional tax liability, and then pay interest to the taxing authority for having understated and underpaid its taxable income for those periods.704 The Tribunal accepts that yearly tax calculations are based upon a range of factors present in a given fiscal year. However, the Ecuadorian taxes at issue here apply to the profits that Murphy Ecuador would have posted had it not paid Law 42 payments. The relevant fiscal years to which those figures apply are closed. Claimant submits no evidence that the labour and income tax rates set forth in the Participation Contract would not have applied over those terms. The taxation of Murphy\u2019s profits as a result of the present award is a separate matter.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 757; Second Navigant Expert Report, para. 77.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 757; Second Navigant Expert Report, para. 81.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 757; Second Navigant Expert Report, para. 81.\n\n445.\n\nRelatedly, Claimant argues that if corporate taxes were deducted from a damages claim, there would be a real risk of double taxation.705 Claimant, however, has not substantiated this assertion. It has not furnished evidence to show that it would be obliged to pay taxes on a damages award either in Ecuador, the United States, or another jurisdiction. Claimant relies on a NAFTA case in which the claimant, Corn Products Inc., petitioned the tribunal in its NAFTA Chapter 11 case against Mexico to alter its damages award from a post-tax basis to a pre-tax basis.706 Corn Products did so after discovering that the award was possibly subject to tax in Mexico.707 Murphy has not established what tax\u2014labour, income or another kind\u2014the present award of damages would possibly be subject to, if any, nor in which jurisdiction, nor at what rate. The Tribunal is satisfied that the amounts paid by Murphy Ecuador from 2006-2008 to Ecuador would have been taxed as per the Participation Contract. This much is not in dispute.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 757; Second Navigant Expert Report, para. 78.\n\nSecond Navigant Expert Report, paras. 79-80; *Corn Products International Inc. v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/04/1.\n\n\"Corn Products asks tribunal to correct the award so as to take account of likely taxation of award in Mexico\", *Investment Arbitration Reporter*, 14 October 2009, **NAV-76**. The Tribunal understands that, in response to the request to correct the award, the tribunal did not change the amount awarded but rather amended the award to make it payable to Corn Products International Inc., a US company, rather than to its Mexican subsidiary. *See* http://www.youngicca-blog.com/tax-gross-up-claims-in-investment-treaty-arbitration-by-nhu-hoang-tran-thang/ (last visited 2 May 2016).\n\n446.\n\nClaimant submits that income and labour taxes should not be \"\u2018netted\u2019 out on paper through a damages award\" because this means that the specific party that would normally receive the cash ultimately does not.708 If labour tax were \"netted\" out against an award compensating the Law 42 payments, Claimant argues that the employees of the Consortium would not receive this benefit. Rather, Ecuador would be the beneficiary of the labour tax deduction from the award.709 The Tribunal\u2019s present analysis, however, is concerned with placing Claimant back in the position that it was in but-for the unlawful conduct of Ecuador. The Tribunal is not concerned with the impact its award would have on the employees of the Consortium, nor for that matter with the impact its award would have on Ecuador. That is not part of the present exercise which is the calculation of the quantum of Claimant\u2019s loss. The Tribunal notes that if it accepted Claimant\u2019s example, any gain from not deducting labour tax from an award would go to the Consortium\u2019s employees, and not to Claimant in any event.\n\nSecond Navigant Expert Report, para. 82.\n\nSecond Navigant Expert Report, para. 82.\n\n447.\n\nIn two cases relied upon by Claimant, compensation was sought directly by the injured company.710 The claimant party was directly subject to taxes unlike here where the shareholder benefits from the operating company's profits post-tax. It may in some cases be necessary to award damages pre-tax to restore an injured company to its but-for condition. But that is not the case here. To restore Murphy to its but-for situation, taxes should be deducted.\n\n*Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a.s. v. Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Award, 29 December 2004, para. 223, **RLA-407** ; *Duke Energy* Award, para. 483, **CLA-22**.\n\n448.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that under the SPA, all of Murphy Ecuador's obligations to pay taxes arising from prior periods of operation were transferred to Repsol YPF.711 As Murphy is not a party to the SPA, the Tribunal does not find that the arrangement between Canam and Repsol YPF is relevant to the present analysis. Any claim for amounts arising from Repsol YPF's obligation to pay tax would have to be made by Canam from Repsol YPF under the SPA.\n\nSPA, p. 30, **CEX-127** ; First Navigant Expert Report, paras. 91, 112; Second Navigant Expert Report, paras. 75-93; Hearing Transcript (19 Nov. 2014), 516:18 to 519:13, 577:17-22. Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 47.\n\n449.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it is appropriate to deduct labour and income taxes from the amount awarded to Claimant under this heading. The standard of compensation that the Tribunal must apply is full reparation such that Claimant is placed in the position it would have been in but-for the breach. Not only should reparation wipe out all the adverse consequences of the illegal act, it should also \"restore the liabilities that were avoided but for the wrong.\"712 The Participation Contract provides for 15% labour profit sharing (clause 11.2.2) and 25% income tax (clause 11.2.3), and together, a consolidated tax rate and labour profit sharing rate of 36.25% (clause 11.2.4).713 Had Law 42 and its related measures not been enacted, labour participation and income tax would have applied to the sums not paid. The payments would have been made by Murphy Ecuador, not Murphy. Murphy Ecuador's additional profits would have first been subject to Ecuadorian taxes before being available for distribution up the corporate chain. It is only be deducting these taxes that the Tribunal will put Murphy back in the position it would have been but for the Law 42 payments at 99%.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, para 648, *referring to* *Chevron Corporation and Texaco Petroleum Company v. The Republic of Ecuador*, PCA Case No. AA277, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 31 August 2011, para. 308, **RLA 430**.\n\nParticipation Contract, cls. 11.2.2-11.2.4, **CEX-36**. The Tribunal determines that the appropriate corporate income tax rate to be applied is the historical rate of 25% provided for in the Participation Contract rather than the current rate of 22% posited by Claimant in the later stages of this arbitration.\n\n450.\n\nIn addition to deducting labour and income tax to the total amount paid, when calculating the financial impact of the Law 42 payments on Claimant, Respondent also took into account the foregone profit of Murphy Ecuador that resulted from the monthly payments and brought it to a present value as of March 2009.714 Respondent did so based on the fact that until March 2009, Murphy bore the industrial risk related to oil and gas operations. After the sale of Murphy Ecuador in March 2009, it did not. As a consequence of that risk, Respondent considered that each damage component until March 2009 should not only consider the time value of money but also reflect the industrial risk borne by Claimant. Respondent quantified this amount according to the expected return of investors at a rate of 12%.715 It considered that 12% was an appropriate proxy to reflect the time value of money and the industrial risk associated with the operations of Murphy Ecuador.716 Claimant and its expert do not object to this aspect of Respondent's damages calculation nor do they address it in any detail.717 The Tribunal accepts that there was an industrial risk that applied to Murphy's investment up until it sold its investment in March 2009. The Tribunal accepts to apply the actualisation rate of 12% to the amounts paid by Claimant under Law 42 at 99% until March 2009. From March 2009, the Tribunal will apply an appropriate interest rate (to be determined in Section 4 below).\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 105-112.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 107-109:  \n \"107. The expected return of investors is commonly considered in businesss valuation through the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"WACC\"), which represents the risk incurred by capital providers for all business activities. Yet, the WACC of a company should not be systematically used in valuing individual projects with special industrial risk. This is key in the oil and gas industry, where the higher expected return of successful projects offsets the sunk costs of unsuccessful exploration projects. This implies that the required discount rate (used to value a specific oil and gas asset) is not the company's WACC, unless the risks associated with a specific asset are similar to those of the overall company.  \n 108. It is therefore essential to check the appropriateness of the standard industry WACC before using it as the actualisation rate (or discount rate) applied to a specific oil and gas project.  \n 109. In light of the above, we considered it necessary to determine an actualisation rate that fairly reflects the industrial risk associated with the operations of the Projects operated by Murphy. Based on our experience, discount rates used for oil and gas projects generally range between 10% and 15%. These figures are supported by the 9-15% range and the 13.4% average derived from external studies.\"\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, para. 110.\n\nSecond Navigant Expert Report, para. 128.\n\n451.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that Murphy is entitled to compensation under this head of claim for the difference between the total amount paid by Murphy Ecuador at 99% for the period November 2007 to March 2008 and what it would have paid over the same period had Law 42 remained at 50%. That amount totals USD 27,710,358. An actualisation rate of 12% applied to that amount results in a total of USD 31,327,544. After a consolidated tax rate of 36.25% (labour tax at 15% and income tax at 25%) is applied to the amount of USD 31,327,544, the total amount of compensation due to Murphy under this head of claim is **USD 19,971,309**.\n\n3. **Lost Cash Flows from March 2009 to January 2012**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n***A. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n452.\n\nClaimant claims compensation for the difference between cash flows that its investment would have earned but-for Law 42 and related measures and what it received from selling its investment to Repsol in light of those measures.718 Claimant submits that, before the expiration of the Participation Contract on 31 January 2012, it would have collected USD 354.99 million via Murphy Ecuador if not for Law 42, which caused it to sell Murphy Ecuador.719\n\nHearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 164:19 to 165:9.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 455 *referring to* First Navigant Expert Report, para. 111.\n\n453.\n\nTo calculate these damages, Claimant uses *ex-post* data. Claimant submits that the but-for cash flows should be based on actual oil production and prices for March 2009 to January 2012.720 Claimant argues that the actual production of the Consortium from March 2009 to January 2012 (less the proceeds from the sale to Repsol YPF) best represents the actual loss caused by Ecuador's unlawful conduct and should be used by the Tribunal to re-establish the situation that would have existed had the unlawful act not been committed.721\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 759; First Navigant Expert Report, para. 74.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 764 *referring to* Navigant Second Expert Report, para. 105. It is important to note that, because Ecuador refused to produce actual data, Claimant does not rely on *actual* information on production and oil prices. Rather, it relies on publicly available information and historical data to estimate what Murphy Ecuador's performance would have been between March 2009 and January 2012 (First Navigant Expert Report, para. 74; Second Navigant Expert Report, para. 94).\n\n454.\n\nClaimant refers the Tribunal to the *AMCO Asia v. Indonesia*,722*CMS v. Argentina*,723 and *Enron v. Argentina*724 cases in which the tribunals used *ex-post* information rather than an *ex-ante* valuation to calculate damages. The tribunal in *AMCO Asia v. Indonesia*, when assessing damages for an unlawful revocation of an investor's license for a period of more than nine years prior to the award date, relied on an *ex-post* valuation based on actual information on inflation, exchange, and tax rates during that time.725 The tribunal based its damages calculation also on predictions made by financial experts on annual income early in the relevant period.726 In *CMS v. Argentina* and *Enron v. Argentina*, each tribunal sought to establish the fair market value of the respective investment at the time the injury occurred on an *ex-ante* basis. However, the tribunals relied on *ex-post* data such as actual exchange rates and natural gas demand, in order to adjust imprecise predictions made as of the valuation date.727\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 765, *referring to* *AMCO Asia Corp. v.

Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n458.\n\nRespondent contests Claimant's claim for the lost cash flows of Murphy Ecuador. It argues that Claimant has failed to establish a causal link between Law 42 and the loss of these cash flows. Furthermore, it characterizes the damages allegedly resulting from the lost cash flows as highly speculative.735\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1031. *See also* Hearing Transcript (19 Nov. 2014), 609:17 to 610:2.\n\n459.\n\nAccording to Respondent, it was Claimant's voluntary business decision to sell its shareholding in Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF, which in turn resulted in the non-collection of the cash flows.736 Among the other options available to Claimant was the possibility to renegotiate the existing contractual arrangements with Ecuador, as the other Consortium members did, with success. However, Claimant had forbidden Murphy Ecuador from participating in the renegotiations.737 Respondent argues that no compensation is due when the loss is caused by the acts of the alleged \"victim\".738 Claimant cannot claim for Murphy Ecuador's cash flows as they were generated after Claimant sold Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF. In support of its position, Respondent cites cases holding that a party cannot claim for losses suffered by a former subsidiary after the transfer of that subsidiary to a third party.739\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1005.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 1004-1006.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, para. 674, *referring to* J.

Respondent contends that the sum of the two components results in an actual value of Murphy Ecuador as of March 2009 that exceeds its but-for value at the same date.741 It argues that allowing Claimant to recover the cash flows that would have been generated by Murphy Ecuador had it not been sold would represent double counting and result in unjust enrichment to Claimant.742\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1008.\n\nRespondent's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 63, *referring to* SPA, Clause 8.1.3, **CEX-127** ; First Navigant Expert Report, Exhibit **NAV-39**.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 107.\n\n461.\n\nEven were Claimant entitled to claim for cash flows,743 which is denied, Respondent rejects the inclusion in Claimant's valuation methodology of *ex-post* information, which it says inflates Claimant's damages claim.744 According to Respondent, if the cash flows were to be determined on an *ex-post* basis, then the valuation of Murphy Ecuador would also have to account for the *ex-post* gains generated by the settlement agreement with Ecuador.745 Otherwise, Respondent alleges, Claimant would in effect be comparing \" *ex-post* \u2018but for' values with *ex-ante* actual values\", which is incorrect.746\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 109.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1001.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 1002, 1017; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 114.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 99-101, 163-164.\n\n462.\n\nRespondent identifies March 2009 as the only appropriate valuation date.747 It refers to legal authorities748 and investment tribunals749 for the position that damages should be valued as of the date of the alleged harm. Respondent submits that \"no *ex-post* information should be considered\".750 Similarly, Respondent's expert states that it is the prevalent standard in valuation theory that an asset should be appraised on an *ex-ante* basis \"to reflect the valuation position of a willing buyer and a willing seller, regardless of subsequent information unanticipated at the date of valuation\".751 Respondent also cites the World Bank's Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment, which mandate compensation to be \"based on the fair market value of the taken asset as such value is determined immediately before the time at which the taking occurred or the decision to take the asset became publicly known.\"752\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1011.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1012, *referring to* Kantor, VALUATION FOR ARBITRATION: COMPENSATION STANDARDS, VALUATION METHODS AND EXPERT EVIDENCE (2008), p. 60, **RLA-336** (\" ***Kantor*** \").\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1012, *referring to* *Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v.

Respondent submits that under the but-for scenario according to which the Participation Contract was set to expire in 2012 the Consortium would not have made these additional investments.754 As for the investment figures, Respondent alleges that Claimant declines to consider the cost of investments made by the Consortium to achieve the actual production figures, with the latter exceeding expectations for December 2008.755 It states, in other words, that Claimant uses the higher production figures but declines to consider the costs of investment that permitted those gains.756\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para 115.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1019-1020, *referring to* First Fair Links Expert Report, para. 159; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 115.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 116.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 116.\n\n464.\n\nRespondent also challenges Claimant's calculation of lost cash flows on the following four grounds.757 First, it states that Claimant has provided no evidence of the actual amount of cash flow that Murphy would have received, after first being received and used by Murphy Ecuador and Canam.758 Second, it posits March 2009 as the appropriate valuation date, and states that accepted valuation practice would exclude using information obtained after Claimant's sale of Murphy Ecuador once it had abandoned all industrial risks related to Murphy Ecuador.759 Third, Respondent submits that Claimant wrongly computes Murphy Ecuador's lost cash flows on a pretax basis, in manifest disregard of widely accepted valuation principles.760 And fourth, Claimant fails to account for lawful revenue measures that Ecuador may have adopted in the but-for scenario. In this regard, Respondent notes that the impact of such measures would have to be deducted from the amount of cash flows for which compensation is sought if Law 42 were found licit in respect of the rate of 50%.761\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1015-1021; Rejoinder on the Merits, paras. 684-685.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 110.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 111, *referring to* Statement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 1010-1014; First Fair Links Expert Report, para. 97; Second Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 87-93, 112118.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 112, *referring to* Second Fair Links Expert Report, para. 104.\n\nRespondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 113-114.\n\n***C. Analysis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------\n\n465.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to compensation for losses suffered as a result of the enactment of Law 42 at 99% which includes the losses it suffered from selling Murphy Ecuador in March 2009 and not participating in the Participation Contract until the end of its term in January 2012.\n\nCausation\n---------\n\n466.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there is a sufficient nexus between Ecuador's breach of the Treaty\u2014 increasing the additional participation from 50% to 99%\u2014and Murphy's decision to sell Murphy Ecuador to establish causation. The reality was that negotiations between the Consortium and Ecuador were being conducted in an increasingly hostile environment in which it was not possible for Murphy to freely negotiate an arms-length deal. The terms proposed by the Government were significantly less favourable to Murphy than the terms of the Participation Contract. Against the threat of the process of *caducidad* (which would have forced Murphy to leave the country immediately without recovering its investment or equipment), and the commencement of *coactiva* proceedings by the Government (by which the Government would seize Murphy's assets in the amounts it claimed were owed under Law 42), Murphy was being forced to accept the significantly less favourable terms proposed by the Government. Murphy's only other option was to sell its share in the Consortium. In this context, Murphy's sale cannot be considered \"voluntary.\" There was an undeniable nexus between Ecuador's conduct in passing and implementing Law 42 at 99% and Murphy's decision to sell. It was a decision forced by Ecuador's breach of the Treaty, taken by Murphy to mitigate its losses:\n\nBecause Murphy no longer wished to operate in such a hostile environment and in an effort to minimize our financial losses, we sold our 20% share in Ecuador to Repsol on March 12, 2009. As the sale to Repsol only mitigated the financial damages Murphy suffered in Ecuador, Murphy and Repsol included in the sale agreement a provision allowing Murphy to maintain its claims against the Government in this arbitration in order to recoup all of Murphy's losses caused by Law 42.762\n\nHerrera Witness Statement, para. 51.\n\n467.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Respondent's assertions that Murphy \"caused\" the post-March 2009 losses by its \"voluntary\" sale to Repsol YPF. The Tribunal is satisfied that but-for Ecuador's breach, Murphy would not have sold its interest in the Consortium.763\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 744, 747; Herrera Witness Statement, paras. 41-48,52:  \n\"Murphy sold Murphy Ecuador to Repsol because of Law 42. But for the enactment of that law, Murphy would have continued operating in Ecuador. Murphy did not agree with the terms that Ecuador demanded in renegotiating the Participation Contract, especially under threats of *caducidad* and *coactiva*. Murphy's objections are well illustrated by the Government's overtures to Murphy in an attempt to persuade Murphy to remove itself and its objections so that a Government deal with Repsol could be reached.\"\n\nThe Appropriate Method for Evaluating Murphy's Loss\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n*i.*  *Analysis of Claimant's different methods for evaluating its loss*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n468.\n\nMurphy's claim for losses in connection with the sale of Murphy Ecuador has been articulated in more than one way over the course of the Murphy ICSID Arbitration and the present case.\n\n469.\n\nIn the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, Claimant sought compensation for the diminution in the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as of 12 March 2009 due to Law 42.764 In order to calculate that amount, Murphy adopted a discounted cash flow analysis assuming that Law 42 had not been enacted, and deducted from that figure the purchase price received for Murphy Ecuador.765 Claimant's projection of cash flow was based upon the free cash flow to equity formula, *i.e*., the remaining cash available after all expenses, taxes, loan repayments, and interest had been paid by the business.766 The damages analysis focused on the *anticipated* production Murphy Ecuador would have received through January 2012, *i.e.*, an *ex-ante* approach. Like the present case, the damages expert for Murphy in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration was Navigant. As concerns *ex-ante* versus *ex-post* data, in its first report filed in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration on 30 April 2009, *i.e.*, very shortly after the sale of Murphy Ecuador in March 2009, Navigant stated that:\n\n[i]n instances where the valuation date for a fair market valuation is a historical date, the valuation practitioner should not normally use hindsight (i.e., use information or events that have transpired between the valuation date and the current date that would bias the valuation) when conducting the valuation analysis. Rather, the valuation practitioner should base his assumptions on reasonable expectations as of the valuation date. This is because the goal of establishing a fair market value at a historical date is to establish a price a willing buyer and willing seller would have paid and accepted, respectively, for the investment at that time. Therefore, hindsight which incorporates events or information that could not have been reasonably forecasted at the valuation date should be ignored.767 (emphasis added)\n\nNavigant First ICSID Expert Report, 30 April 2009, para. 65, **CEX-218/REX-112**.\n\nNavigant First ICSID Expert Report, 30 April 2009, paras. 101, 135, **CEX-218/REX-112**.\n\nNavigant First ICSID Expert Report, 30 April 2009, para. 102, **CEX-218/REX-112**.\n\nNavigant First ICSID Expert Report, 30 April 2009, para. 82, **CEX-218/REX-112**.\n\n470.\n\nAt that time, Navigant calculated the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador to be USD 93,226,473, based on the following formula: *Net Income + Depreciation \u2014 Capital Expenditures \u2014 Changes in net working capital \u2014 Loan Repayments.768* This figure, less the purchase price then calculated at USD 80 million, resulted in claimed damages of USD 13,226,473.\n\nNavigant First ICSID Expert Report, 30 April 2009, paras. 101, 133, **CEX-218/REX-112**.\n\n471.\n\nIn the same report, Navigant went on to state that:\n\nThe damages approach we have adopted in our report relies upon projections of future crude oil prices and operating costs as of 1 March 2009. However, as the arbitral process continues, actual crude oil prices and operating costs can be observed during our projection period. We understand that the Tribunal may consider it more appropriate to incorporate actual crude oil prices (particularly if actual crude oil prices exceed those in our forecast) and operating costs into the damages analysis as they become known. Accordingly, we may update our damages calculation in preparing our second expert report and just prior to the hearing to accommodate this known information.769 (emphasis added)\n\nNavigant First ICSID Expert Report, 30 April 2009, para. 136, **CEX-218/REX-112**.\n\n472.\n\nIn Navigant's second expert report filed on 29 January 2010, Navigant amended its *ex-ante* calculation of the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador due to, *inter alia*, an error in its original formula, resulting in a reduction of approximately USD 5 million in the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador.770 It then offered an alternative fair market value using *ex-post* data in the form of up-to-date crude oil prices for 2009:\n\n[W]e have provided an alternative calculation of the losses Murphy has suffered utilizing actual crude oil prices between March 2009 and December 2009 and the revised expected future oil prices as of 1 January 2010. Given the rise in oil prices since we produced our first report, it is logical in our view that damages should be based upon this alternative calculation.771\n\nNavigant Second ICSID Expert Report, 30 April 2009, para. 148, **CEX-221/REX-115**.\n\nNavigant Second ICSID Expert Report, 30 April 2009, paras. 150-154, **CEX-221/REX-115**.\n\n473.\n\nThe higher crude oil prices incorporated into Navigant's alternative damages analysis and the correspondingly altered operating costs increased the damages pertaining to the diminution in the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador. The fair market value of Murphy Ecuador less the purchase price, then calculated at USD 78.9 million, resulted in claimed damages of USD 51,476,735.772\n\nNavigant Second ICSID Expert Report, 30 April 2009, para. 154, **CEX-221/REX-115**.\n\n474.\n\nIn the present case, rather than seeking the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador but-for Law 42 (less the purchase price), Claimant seeks the lost cash flows it would have received but-for Law 42 (less the purchase price). Claimant's calculation of lost cash flows in this arbitration is based on the following formula: *Operating Income + Depreciation - Capital Expenditures - Labour Force Tax - Changes in net working capital.773*\n\nFirst Navigant Expert Report, para. 75.\n\n475.\n\nRather than relying on *ex-ante* data, Claimant submits that the Tribunal should assess damages based on what the Consortium actually produced and sold from March 2009 through January 2012, less the proceeds of the sale of Murphy Ecuador. Claimant now claims damages of USD 754.99 million in lost cash flows (not including interest), which it submits it would have collected through Murphy Ecuador before the expiration of the Participation Contract in January 2012 if Law 42 had not caused Claimant to sell Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF in March 2009.774 Claimant calculates this amount based on *ex-post* data and a but-for scenario assuming the absence of Law 42, in which the Claimant would not have sold Murphy Ecuador and would have continued to receive cash flows through Murphy Ecuador until 71 January 2012.775\n\n*See above*, para. 452.\n\nSecond Navigant Expert Report, paras. 97-102 and Figure 6; First Navigant Expert Report, paras. 72-99.\n\n476.\n\nIn its calculations, Claimant does not discount cash flows to a date in the past, but rather takes the cash flows as received annually at their nominal value.776 Claimant then applies interest to each cash flow from the year it would have been received in the but-for scenario until the date of the award.777 Finally, Claimant deducts the actual sales price received from Repsol YPF for Murphy Ecuador and interest thereon until the date of the award.778\n\nSecond Navigant Expert Report, paras. 97-102 and Figure 6; First Navigant Expert Report, paras. 72-99.\n\nSecond Navigant Expert Report, paras. 97-102 and Figure 6; First Navigant Expert Report, paras. 72-99.\n\nSecond Navigant Expert Report, paras. 97-102 and Figure 6; First Navigant Expert Report, paras. 72-99.\n\n477.\n\nAccording to Claimant, the discounted cash flow approach it used in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration and the lost cash flows approach it uses now are different methodologies to calculate the same losses:\n\nThe only difference between the DCF approach and the lost cash flows approach is the information used to make the calculations.... In sum, both the DCF and the lost cash flows approaches were used to calculate the same set of losses, *i.e*., Murphy International's loss of the economic benefits of the Participation Contract from March 2009 to January 2012 due to the forced and premature sale albeit using different methods and available data, and at different moments in time.779\n\nClaimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 49-50.\n\n478.\n\nIn its second report filed in this case, Navigant referred to this category of damages as \"the diminution in value (or lost cash flows) from March 2009 to January 2012.\"780\n\nSecond Navigant Expert Report, para. 73.\n\n*ii.*  *Analysis of Respondent's method. for evaluating Murphy's loss*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n479.\n\nRespondent bases its damages calculation on an assessment of the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador on 12 March 2009, at the time it was sold by Claimant to Repsol YPF.781 In order to determine the hypothetical value of Murphy Ecuador in the absence of Law 42, Respondent also conducts a but-for assessment.782 This assessment is based on a DCF analysis using 12 March 2009 as the valuation date.783 To project the cash flows expected to be received by Murphy Ecuador in the remaining contractual period of the Participation Contract, *i.e.*, between 12 March 2009 and 31 January 2012, Respondent relies on information that was available, or at least ascertainable, for a willing buyer at the time of the valuation date.784 Respondent's calculation does not take into account any subsequent events after the valuation date, including any rise in oil prices and oil production levels.785 The future free cash flows thus determined by Respondent are then brought back to the valuation date by employing a discount rate of 12%.786 Finally, the actual sales price received by Claimant for Murphy Ecuador is subtracted from the calculated fair market value of Murphy Ecuador in the but-for scenario.787 Applying a base case scenario in respect of the underlying assumptions regarding the future business of Murphy Ecuador after March 2009, Respondent arrives at a difference between the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as of March 2009 and the sales price achieved by Claimant in an amount of USD 8.9 million.788\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 84-88.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 129-130.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, para. 130.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 131-134, 136-146.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, para. 135.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 106-110, 150.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 153-155.\n\nSecond Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 124-126; this incorporates an amendment to the calculation in the First Fair Links Expert Report (at paras. 153-155), which computed a difference between fair market value and actual sales price in the amount of USD 6.7 million.\n\nThe Tribunal's Determination as to the Appropriate Valuation Methodology\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n480.\n\nClaimant's backward-looking lost cash flows analysis includes post sale data and does not discount cash flows back to the date of sale, *i.e.*, March 2009. By contrast, Respondent employs a methodology which seeks to establish the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador at the time of its sale to Repsol YPF, relying purely on *ex-ante* available data and applying a discount rate to all future cash flows that are predicted as of March 2009.\n\n481.\n\nThe choice of the valuation methodology has a significant impact on the final damages calculation. The applicable international law standard of full reparation, as reflected in the *Chorzow Factory* judgment and Article 71 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, does not determine the valuation methodology.789 Nor does the Treaty. Tribunals enjoy a large margin of appreciation in order to determine how an amount of money may \"as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"790\n\n*BP Group* Award, paras. 422-429, **CLA-25**.\n\n*Marboe*, p. 1068.\n\n482.\n\nUnder customary international law, if an investor loses ownership or control of its primary investment due to the breach by a host state of its international law obligations, the commonly accepted standard for calculating damages is to appraise the fair market value of the lost investment at the time it was lost, without taking into account subsequent events.791 Although the Tribunal has found that Ecuador breached the FET provision of the Treaty, the result for Claimant was the loss of ownership of its investment. In this way, the outcome was akin to an unlawful expropriation, for which the fair market value of the asset represents the \"lower limit of the award.\"792 Investor-state arbitral tribunals have frequently sought to establish the fair market value at the time of the investor's loss of its primary investment as a basis for the calculation of damages.793 It is also the prevailing approach in financial accounting to consider the *ex-ante* appraisal of an asset as of a certain valuation date without taking into account subsequent developments:\n\n[\u2026] the valuation professional generally should consider \u2018circumstances existing at the valuation date and events occurring up to the valuation date.' Subsequent events, i.e., conditions that were not known or knowable at the valuation date, would not ordinarily be incorporated into a valuation [\u2026] \u2018because a valuation is performed as of a point in time - the valuation date - and the events...occurring subsequent to that date, are not relevant to the value determined as of that date.

The Tribunal notes that Claimant does not state what the transaction value of Murphy Ecuador would have been in March 2009 based on *ex post* information (*see* Second Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 129-133).\n\n484.\n\nThis Tribunal determines that an *ex-post* approach is not appropriate in this case because the *expost* data generated after the sale of Murphy Ecuador does not reflect what the situation would have been in a but-for scenario. The Tribunal rejects Claimant's assertion that the *ex-post* data is \"more relevant and reliable than the information available in 2009.\"797 While the hypothetical but-for scenario can never be stated with complete certainty, based on what was known at the time of breach, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is probable that Murphy would have remained in Ecuador operating under the terms of the Participation Contract subject to Law 42 at 50% until January 2012. Murphy had made all payments due under Law 42 at 50%, albeit under protest, and had exhibited no intention of exiting the Consortium prior to the implementation of Law 42 at 99%. Five months after the introduction of Law 42 at 99%, Murphy stopped making payments. This led to implementation measures by Ecuador (the commencement of *caducidad* and *coactive* proceedings), failed negotiations, and eventually, Murphy's decision to cut its losses and leave the country.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 764.\n\n485.\n\nThe scenario that followed the sale of Murphy Ecuador cannot be compared in any meaningful way with the but-for scenario that would have existed had Law 42 at 99% never been enacted. First, Repsol concluded a Modification Contract with the State which specified transitory terms for one year while the parties negotiated a longer term agreement. In November 2010, the Final Modification Contract\u2014a services contract\u2014was concluded with a term until 2018. In light of the extended term, Repsol made additional investments798 which resulted in increased production levels.799 Production results would not have been the same under the Participation Contract which was due to expire within three years. Under the new contractual framework, the Consortium had incentive to ramp up investment; under the old contractual framework, the incentive would have been to wind down investment. In light of these fundamental differences, the Tribunal does not find it appropriate to apply the *ex-post* data as submitted by Claimant to Claimant's claimed losses. Awarding economic benefit that was not known or comparable at the time of sale would not place Claimant in the position that it would have been in but-for the wrongful act. Such a ruling would replace what was an uncertain future with a particular outcome too far removed from the \u2018but-for' hypothetical.\n\nRepsol committed to invest an estimated USD 177.5 million in new developments up to 2018, related to new investments only. First Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 159, 162; **FL-39** *Repsol Reaches a Preliminary Agreement with the Ecuadorian Government on the Terms of Its Presence in the Country (Press Release)* www repsol.com. March 2009.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, paras. 686-692.\n\n486.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it is appropriate to employ a fair market value methodology with a valuation date as of 12 March 2009, the date of the sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF. The fair market value approach values an asset by considering its ability to generate future economic benefits. Assessing future economic benefits allows one to determine the \"free cash flows\" generated by the asset. It is also the only valuation method that allows for incorporating specific business circumstances into the appraisal of free cash flows. The fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as of 12 March 2009 was subject to the degree of optimism or pessimism regarding its (limited) future in Ecuador as at that date. The Tribunal notes that there is a large degree of overlap between the financial and economic elements used by Claimant to calculate loss of cash flow and by Respondent to calculate fair market value.\n\n487.\n\nThe Tribunal is, however, cognisant of the fact that the fair market value of an investment may not always reflect the damage actually caused by the governmental act and thus would not constitute full reparation.800 Thus, notwithstanding the issue raised above concerning the inappropriateness of *ex post* data in this case, the Tribunal has considered the information that became known after the valuation date.801 Specifically, the Tribunal has examined whether the assumptions on the development of oil prices and oil production levels, on which the *ex-ante* appraisal of Murphy Ecuador's fair market value is based, should be adjusted in the light of actual *ex-post* data. This approach is consistent with the general requirement for awarding damages for violations of international obligations that any compensable damage must not be too speculative, remote, or uncertain.802 The Tribunal's conclusion is that it is neither necessary nor justified to adjust the *ex-ante* calculation of damages as of 12 March 2009, as explained below.\n\n*Marboe*, pp. 1067, para. 25, pp. 1084-1085, paras. 5-6.\n\nKantor, pp. 63-69, **RLA-336**.\n\n*BP Group* Award, paras. 428-429, **CLA-25**.\n\n*i.*Ex-post *information on oil. prices*\n----------------------------------------\n\n488.\n\nFor the purpose of determining oil prices in the period between March 2009 and January 2012 as a factor in the valuation of Murphy Ecuador, Respondent's expert relied on forward quotations for the commodities market crude oil reference WTI (West Texas Intermediate) as of March 2009 to which it applied historical discounts of the Ecuadorian crude oil reference Napo with respect to WTI crude prices.803 Claimant does not criticise this methodology as a means to predict future oil prices. Claimant's expert, however, submits that oil price projections as of March 2009 are inherently uncertain and that this uncertainty can be removed by relying on the available *ex-post* information on oil prices between March 2009 and January 2012.804\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 140-142.\n\nSecond Navigant Expert Report, paras. 114-116.\n\n489.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, while a certain level of insecurity is inherent in any prediction of future economic developments, the public commodities market futures display the relevant market expectations precisely and can be ascertained without difficulty. They provide an objective indication of the predicted oil prices on which a willing seller and a willing buyer for Murphy Ecuador would have relied in March 2009. The fact that actual oil prices deviated from those predictions in the period between March 2009 and January 2012 does not render the prevailing predictions for the oil price market as of March 2009 speculative or unreliable for valuation purposes. These deviations are typical also of other assets (*e.g.*, stock of publicly traded companies) that are typically appraised as of a valuation date without taking into account subsequent developments.805\n\n*See Kantor*, pp. 60-61, **RLA-336**.\n\n*ii.*Ex-post *information on oil. production levels*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n490.\n\nIn respect of oil production levels, Claimant's expert submits that the higher oil production levels between March 2009 and January 2012 realised by the Consortium should be taken into account for quantifying Claimant's damages.806 Claimant explains that higher oil prices in the period between March 2009 and January 2012 would have led to an increase in oil production levels, which is why the historic pre-March 2009 production levels provide no reliable basis for the valuation of Murphy Ecuador.807\n\nFirst Navigant Expert Report, paras. 77-82.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 771.\n\n491.\n\nBy contrast, Respondent submits that the Consortium's actual oil production levels in the period between March 2009 and January 2012 are no suitable comparator for Claimant's oil production in a but-for scenario because (i) they have been realised under the new contractual framework adopted in 2009 and extending the Consortium's operations through the end of 2018; and, (ii) because they are based on significant investments made by the Consortium beginning in 2009.808 For the *ex-ante* valuation of Murphy Ecuador as of March 2009, Respondent's expert used forward production profiles defined by Repsol YPF in 2007 considered until January 2012, before any contractual extensions to 2018 were contemplated. These production profiles assumed no new drilling developments.809 Claimant has not criticised this approach as being unsuitable for an *ex-ante* valuation of Murphy Ecuador.\n\nRejoinder on the Merits, paras. 686-692.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, para. 177.\n\n492.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the projections of oil production levels submitted by Respondent's expert are reasonable and appropriate. Since they are based on Murphy Ecuador's situation under the Participation Contract without taking into account any subsequent investments in production capacities, the forecasted oil production levels serve as more appropriate assumptions upon which to base the valuation of Murphy Ecuador as of March 2009 than the Consortium's production figures for the period between March 2009 and January 2012. It is highly speculative whether these production levels would also have been achieved by Murphy Ecuador in the light of higher oil prices or whether they are rather connected to the Consortium's new contractual arrangements including extended contract terms and subsequent investments in production capacities. Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that it is inappropriate to rely on the Consortium's 2009-2012 production levels for purposes of the valuation of Murphy Ecuador as of March 2009.\n\nTribunal's Calculation of Damages\n---------------------------------\n\n493.\n\nAs stated, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to calculate the damages for the harm Claimant suffered through the enactment of Law 42 at the rate of 99% in connection with the sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF on 12 March 2009 and lost earnings after that time by way of comparison of the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as of 12 March 2009 with the actual sales price for the company received from Repsol YPF.\n\n494.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the Respondent's expert's calculation of the \"but-for\" value of Murphy Ecuador in the absence of Law 42 is reasonable and convincing.810 It is appropriately influenced by assumptions on the application of a discount rate of 12% and the following four main drivers of value (which are consistent with the elements used by Claimant to calculate lost cash flow):\n\ni. the expected production of crude oil;\n\nii. the expected oil-market prices;\n\niii. the expected capital expenditures (\" **Capex** \") and operating expenses (\" **Opex** \"); and\n\niv. taxes, levies and other liabilities.811\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 136-152; Second Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 121-126.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, para. 136.\n\n495.\n\nEach of these assumptions will be addressed below.\n\n*i.*  *Expected. production of crude oil*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n496.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that using the forward production profiles defined by Respol YPF in 2007\u2014still under the Participation Contract framework and before effects of a new contractual framework including extended terms until 2018 came into play\u2014provides a suitable basis for predicting future oil production levels.812 The production profiles were considered until January 2012. Moreover, this prediction is not influenced by later investments in production capacities made by the Consortium beginning in 2009.813 The Tribunal concludes that the production figures used in Respondent's expert's base case scenario are realistic.814\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, para. 137; Second Fair Links Expert Report, para. 124.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 137, 159; Second Fair Links Expert Report, para. 124.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, para. 137; Second Fair Links Expert Report, para. 124.\n\n*ii.*  *Expected oil-market. prices*\n------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nThe Tribunal finds Respondent's expert's predictions of future oil prices based on the objective expectations existing at the commodities market in March 2009 as appropriate.\n\n*iii.*  *Expected Capex and Opex*\n---------------------------------\n\n498.\n\nThe Tribunal also accepts Respondent's expert's projections of Capex and Opex figures from March 2009 through January 2012.815 It is appropriate for those figures to take into account only the existing level of production capacities and the corresponding maintenance costs.\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, para. 147.\n\n*iv.*  *Taxes, levies and other liabilities*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n499.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the Consortium was subject to a variety of taxes and levies including notably labour participation and income tax.816 The Tribunal accepts the additional figures utilised by Fair Links to calculate Murphy Ecuador's various other liabilities under this heading (*i.e.*, Law 20, Law 40, Corpei, transportation tariffs, VAT, and VAT reimbursement).\n\n*See supra* paras. 447-448 for the Tribunal's analysis in this regard which also applies here.\n\n500.\n\nThe Tribunal determines that the asset retirement obligation at the expiration of the project period pursuant to the Participation Contract is reasonably estimated at a value of USD 7 million as of March 2009 in Respondent's expert's calculation.817\n\nFirst Fair Links Expert Report, para. 145.\n\n*v.*  *DCF Computation of the But-For Fair Market Value*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nBased on these economic and financial assumptions, Respondent calculated the future free cash flows of Murphy Ecuador between March 2009 and January 2012. To those values, Respondent applied a discount rate of 12% (reflecting the time value of money and investment risk) to bring their values back to March 2009. Claimant does not criticise this discount rate (Claimant's own methodology does not require the application of a discount rate). Respondent then derives the Net Present Value of the cumulative free cash flows to determine the (base case) but-for value of Murphy Ecuador at USD 87.8 million.818 For the reasons given above, the Tribunal accepts Respondent's calculations.\n\nIn addition to a base case, Respondent calculated a high case (a production scenario where cumulative production is 10% higher than forecast by Repsol in 2007) and a low case (a production scenario where cumulative production is 10% lower than forecast by Repsol in 2007) (*see* First Fair Links Expert Report, para. 178).\n\n502.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as of 12 March 2009 in the absence of Law 42 was USD 87.8 million.819\n\nSecond Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 124, 126. The Tribunal notes that this sum is very close to the fair market value estimated by Claimant in April 2009 in the Murphy ICSID Arbitration, *i.e.*, USD 93,226,473.\n\n503.\n\nThat amount is, however, arrived at by calculations based on a but-for scenario under which Law 42 was not implemented at all. The Tribunal has found that Law 42 at 50% was lawful, but that Law 42 at 99% was unlawful. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that Claimant should be compensated for the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador assuming that the wrongful act\u2014 *i.e.*, Law 42 at 99%\u2014did not occur, meaning that Law 42 at 50% would still have been in place at the valuation date of March 2009. For Claimant to be restored to a \u2018but-for' scenario, the fair market value figure of USD 87.8 million must be adjusted to account for the fact that Murphy Ecuador would have continued paying participation under Law 42 at 50% if Law 42 at 99% had never been introduced.\n\n504.\n\nThe Tribunal is not able to calculate that sum on the basis of the information submitted by the Parties. The Tribunal directs the Parties to attempt to agree within three months from the date of this Award on the adjustment that should be made to the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador of USD 87.8 million to account for an ongoing obligation on the part of Claimant to make Law 42 payments at 50% (\" **Adjusted Sum** \"). The Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to any difference between the Adjusted Sum and the purchase price of USD 78.9 million for Murphy Ecuador (\" **Entitlement** \"). The Tribunal also directs the Parties to attempt to agree on the pre- and postaward interest calculations that flow from the Tribunal's rulings here and in the following section. If the Parties fail to agree on any sum within that time period, the Tribunal will invite each Party to submit, simultaneously and within a further month, a submission setting out that Party's calculation of the Adjusted Sum, the Entitlement, and pre- and post-award interest. The Tribunal will then make the necessary findings.\n\n4. **Interest**\n---------------\n\n***A. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n505.\n\nClaimant requests that the Tribunal award compound interest on the historical amounts claimed at the yield reflective of Ecuador's US dollar sovereign cost of debt until the date of an award.820 For the interest calculation, Claimant asks the Tribunal to assume an award date of August 2015.821 Claimant further requests that the Tribunal award post-award interest at the same rate of pre-award interest, *i.e.*, Ecuador's external borrowing rate in US dollars,822 compounded semi-annually until the date of payment.823\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 450, *referring to* First Navigant Report, paras. 7-11. *See also* Hearing Transcript (17 Nov. 2014), 171:18 to 172:8; Hearing Transcript (19 Nov. 2014), 524:6 to 531:8; Claimant's Closing Statement, Slide 249.\n\nHearing Transcript (20 Nov. 2014), 710:25.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 452, *referring to* First Navigant Expert Report, para. 101.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 460.\n\n506.\n\nNoting that the vast majority of BIT tribunals have awarded compound interest, Claimant states that \"[c]ompound interest should be available as a matter of course if economic reality requires such an award to place the claimant in the position it would have been in had it never been injured.\"824 Because \"compound interest is the norm\" in financing and commercial transactions, Claimant alleges that awarding only simple interest results in a situation in which \"the party receiving simple interest is in essence making interest-free loans to the party paying the simple interest.\"825\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 460, *citing Vivendi II* Award, para. 9.2.6, **CLA-13/37**.\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 460, *referring to* Colon and Knoll, Prejudgment Interest In International Arbitration, Vol. 4, Issue 6, TRANSNATIONAL DISPUTE MANAGEMENT 10 (November 2007), **CLA-106**.\n\n507.\n\nClaimant rejects the use of the US LIBOR rate of 0.78%. It disagrees with the position that an arbitration award is a \"risk free\" proposition.826 It explains that, in any case, LIBOR is not a riskfree rate, but a rate charged between banks.827 Claimant also notes that LIBOR is not typically available to investors unless the investor is a bank.828\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 779, *referring to* Second Navigant Expert Report para. 171.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 778.\n\nReply on the Merits and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 778.\n\n***B. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n508.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the interest claimed by Murphy is indefensible given that Claimant bore no industrial risk in relation to Murphy Ecuador after March 2009.829 It submits, therefore, that the pre-March 2009 interest rate should consider both the time-value of money and industrial risk, whereas the post-March 2009 interest rate should account for the time-value of money alone because Claimant bore no industrial risk from then on.830 It notes that, barring evidence showing that but-for the breach of the obligation the aggrieved party would have invested the lost amounts in a specific investment project, the only compensation for the passage of time should be the award of interest at the risk-free rate.831\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 991. *See also* Hearing Transcript (19 Nov. 2014), 610:716.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 1025-1027, *referring to* First Fair Links Expert Report, paras. 106, 167-168.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1023.\n\n509.\n\nRespondent rejects the claim for compound interest. According to Respondent, \"in the place of compound interest at Ecuador's external borrowing rate in U.S. dollars, the Tribunal should prefer an application of linear interest at the US Libor rate\" because, after March 2009, Claimant would no longer be entitled to a rate of interest reflecting industrial risk, but only to compensation for the time value of money and the U.S. Libor rate is \"the most appropriate rate to account for the time value of money\".832\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 1027-1028; Respondent's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 125.\n\n510.\n\nRespondent contends that an injured party does not have \"any entitlement to compound interest, in the absence of special circumstances which justify some element of compounding as an aspect of full reparation.\"833 It alleges that Claimant has not presented special circumstances to justify deviating from the general international law norm of simple interest.834\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1028, *referring to ILC Commentary*, p. 109, Comment (9) to Art. 38, **RLA-284** ; *Crawford*, Third Report on State Responsibility, International Law Commission, A/CN.4/507/Add.1 (15 June 2000), para. 211, **RLA-282** (\"[C]ompound interest is not generally awarded under international law or by international tribunals.\").\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 1028.\n\n***C. Analysis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------\n\n511.\n\nWhile Article III(1) of the US-Ecuador BIT directs that in the case of a lawful expropriation \"[c]ompensation shall [\u2026] include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation\", the Treaty is silent on interest applicable to an award of compensation for breach of the FET standard. In the absence of express stipulations in the Treaty, the Tribunal finds guidance on the matter in Article 38 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, which reads as follows:\n\nInterest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.\n\nInterest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled. (emphasis added)\n\n512.\n\nThe Commentary on Article 78 provides that \"[t]he awarding of interest depends on the circumstances of each case; in particular, on whether an award of interest is necessary in order to ensure full reparation.\"835\n\n*ILC Commentary*, Article 78, at para. 7.\n\n513.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that its general power to award interest to Claimant is not disputed by Respondent. The Tribunal deems it appropriate to award interest for damages so as to ensure full reparation to Claimant.\n\n514.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the practice of past tribunals on the award of interest and considers it varied and inconsistent, falling short of providing clear guidance.836 However, it is well established that the Tribunal enjoys a wide margin of discretion to determine the rate of interest applicable and whether it shall be simple or compound in order to ensure full reparation to the damaged party.837\n\n*Ripinsky and Williams*, DAMAGES IN INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW (2008), p. 766 (\" ***Ripinsky and Williams*** \"), provides an overview of what they consider to be four different approaches.\n\nRipinsky and Williams, pp. 765-766.\n\n515.\n\nAs to the appropriate rate of interest, Claimant's expert suggests that \"the most appropriate rate to apply is Ecuador's external borrowing rate in U.S. dollar\".838 Respondent argues that an actualisation rate of 12% should apply to claims for the period until March 2009, while an award of interest at a commercially reasonable risk-free rate, as reflected in the USD LIBOR rate, would be most appropriate for claims after March 2009.839\n\nStatement of Claim, para. 452, *referring to* First Navigant Expert Report, para. 101.\n\nStatement of Defense and Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 1026-1027.\n\n516.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees with Claimant's proposition that Ecuador's external borrowing rate in U.S. dollar should be adopted. Embracing this view would mean that Respondent's risk characteristics, and not Claimant's actual loss, would be determinative. This would run counter to the fundamental premise of the notion of compensation, which is to restore the position Claimant would have enjoyed absent the breach. The Tribunal thus finds itself in partial agreement with Respondent and deems the award of interest based on the USD LIBOR rate most appropriate, as it, in the Tribunal's opinion, reflects the best approximate rate that Claimant would have had to pay if it had been obliged to borrow the money.\n\n517.\n\nIn accordance with the practice in past cases, the Tribunal further decides that the prime rate has to be increased by a few percentage points considering that only the most solvent and creditworthy borrowers are able to borrow money from banks at the prime rate. To account for this fact, Tribunals in recent cases have added up to four percentage points to the prime rate.840 In the present circumstances, the Tribunal similarly deems it appropriate to award interest at the rate of USD LIBOR + 4% as the most reasonable reflection of Claimant's loss.841\n\n*Flughafen Zurich A.G. y Gestion e Ingenieria IDC S.A. v. The Boliviarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/19, Award, 18 November 2014, para. 969 (\" ***Flughafen Zurich*** **Award** \"); *OI European Group B.V. v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25, Award, 10 March 2015, para. 982 (\" ***OI European*** **Award** \").\n\nTo calculate the USD LIBOR rate, the Tribunal has followed the approach used by Respondent (First Fairlinks Expert Report, Exhibit 5), *i.e.*, calculated the average of the three-month USD LIBOR rate over the relevant period, for a rate of 0.3668%.\n\n518.\n\nIn respect of the starting date (*dies a quo*), the Tribunal recalls Article 38(2) of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility quoted above and notes that the general practice in investment arbitration is to award interest from the date of the breach of the treaty. While the Tribunal has found that the date of breach of the treaty is 18 October 2007, it determines the following with respect to the start date for the accrual of interest at the rate of USD LIBOR + 4%:\n\ni. Law 42 payments at 99% : the Tribunal has actualized the value of the payment paid under Law 42 at 99% at a rate of 12% for a total of USD 19,971,309.00.842 The Tribunal determines that interest on this amount shall accrue at a rate of USD LIBOR + 4% from 13 March 2009;\n\nii. Lost cash flow : the Tribunal determines that interest on the Entitlement shall accrue at a rate of USD LIBOR + 4% from 13 March 2009, being the date of injury to Murphy through its sale of Murphy Ecuador to Repsol YPF.\n\n*See supra* para. 450.\n\n519.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal must determine whether the interest shall accrue on a simple or compound basis. The Tribunal takes the view that an award of compound interest is appropriate in this case, as it most accurately remedies the economic loss actually incurred by Claimant and prevents the unjust enrichment of Respondent. The Tribunal disagrees with Respondent's proposition that, in the absence of special circumstances, a general international law norm of simple interest is applicable in investor-State arbitrations. A review of the practice of tribunals across the past fifteen years demonstrates that compound interest is commonly applied. In this regard, the award in *Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. The Republic of Costa Rica*843***(\"Santa Elena*** *\"),* issued in 2000, has been aptly described as \"a turning point in jurisprudence\".844 It articulated the following principles, which the Tribunal finds apply equally in the present case:\n\n103. [...] the determination of interest is a product of the exercise of judgment, taking into account all of the circumstances of the case at hand and especially considerations of fairness which must form part of the law to be applied by this Tribunal.\n\n104. In particular, where an owner of property has at some earlier time lost the value of his asset but has not received the monetary equivalent that then became due to him, the amount of compensation should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest. It is not the purpose of compound interest to attribute blame to, or to punish, anybody for the delay in the payment made to the expropriated owner; it is a mechanism to ensure that the compensation awarded the Claimant is appropriated in the circumstances.845\n\n*Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A. v. The Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1.\n\nRipinsky and Williams, p. 385.\n\n*Santa Elena* Award, paras. 103-104.\n\n520.\n\nSubsequent tribunals have repeatedly followed the *Santa Elena* approach, creating what has been referred to as a form of *jurisprudence constante*846 in investor-State cases,847 including cases decided under the US-Ecuador BIT.848 The Tribunal is conscious of the fact that the majority of these cases have found liability for unlawful expropriations, but notes that tribunals\u2014in particular in more recent cases\u2014have also granted compound interest for the violation of other treaty obligations.849 While the Tribunal is not bound by previous decisions, it does not consider it appropriate to deviate from this established practice in the absence of special circumstances, which Respondent has failed to prove.\n\n*OKO Pankki Oyj and others v. Republic of Estonia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/6, Award, 19 November 2007, para. 349 (\" ***OKO Pankki*** **Award** \").\n\nTo name but a few: *Siemens* Award, paras. 390-400, **CLA-12** ; *Azurix* Award, paras. 439-440, **CLA-10** ; *OKO Pankki* Award, para. 345-353; *Continental Casualty* Award, para. 309-313, **CLA-183/RLA-339** ; *Gemplus, S.A., SLP, S.A. and Gemplus Industrial, S.A. de C.V.

The Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, Award, 9 April 2015, p. 62.\n\n521.\n\nAs regards the compounding intervals, the Tribunal observes that there are no general rules.850 Most recent awards have favoured annual,851 semi-annual,852 or even monthly853 compounding. In this case, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to direct that interest be compounded on an annual basis.\n\n*Marboe.* Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law (2009), at paras. 6,210-6.212.\n\n*Flughafen Zurich* Award, para. 969: *OI European* Award, para. 982.\n\n*Azurix* Award, para. 440. CLA-10.\n\n*Mobil Investments* Award, para. 170.\n\n522.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal awards pre-award interest as below:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Pre-Award Interest at i | ate of USD LIBOR + 4% compounded annually |\n| Total damages awarded (USD) | Interest start date | Interest end date | Total USD |\n| USD 19,971,309.00 | 13 March 2009 | 6 May 2016 | Figure A: USD 7,136,121 |\n| Entitlement | 13 March 2009 | Date the Adjusted Sum is agreed or determined | Figure B: Entitlement + Pre-Award Interest |\n| Total damages plus pre-award interest | Sum of Figure A and B: USD 7,136,121 plus (Entitlement + Pre-Award Interest) |\n\n523.\n\nAs regards post-Award interest, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from its determination of the appropriate rate in respect of pre-Award interest. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that Claimant is entitled to post-Award interest from the date of this Award until the date of payment at a rate of USD LIBOR + *4%* compounded annually. Post-Award interest is to be calculated on the Sum of Figure A and B.\n\n**X. COSTS OF ARBITRATION**\n---------------------------\n\n524.\n\nThe Treaty contains no provisions on the allocation of the costs of arbitration in the case of a dispute between an Investor and a Contracting Party.\n\n525.\n\nArticles 38 to 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules address the fixing and apportionment of the costs of arbitration.\n\n526.\n\nArticle 38 defines the \"costs of arbitration\" as follows:\n\n[\u2026] The term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f) Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\n527.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides as follows:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n***A.

OVERVIEW OF THE DISPUTE**\n-------------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe present dispute arises out of a series of legislative measures taken by Ecuador relating to its hydrocarbons industry, following increases in oil prices beginning in the first half of the 2000s. It relates in particular to the operation of a **Participation Contract** entered into in 1996 by a consortium of foreign investors (the \" **Consortium** \") in which Murphy held an indirect interest through its 100-percent-owned subsidiary, Murphy Ecuador Oil Limited (\" **Murphy Ecuador** \"), and the predecessor of the state-owned entity Petroecuador. According to the Claimant, the Participation Contract operated such that the Consortium would receive a share of the oil production calculated on the basis of volume of production and without regard to oil prices. The Claimant submits that the Respondent breached its obligations under the Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed on 27 August 1993 (the \" **BIT** \" or \" **Treaty** \") by enacting legislation entitling the Respondent to participate in the Consortium's profits where the market value of oil exceeded certain reference prices (\" **Law 42** \"). That level of participation was first set at a maximum of 50 percent and revised some months later to 99 percent (\" **Law 42 at 50%** \" or \" **Law 42 at 99%**,\" respectively).\n\n4.\n\nOn 6 May 2016, the Tribunal rendered a Partial Final Award (the \" **Partial Final Award** \"), recognizing a violation of the Treaty by the Respondent through its implementation of Law 42 at 99%.\n\n5.\n\nIn paragraph 503 of the Partial Final Award, the Tribunal stated the following with respect to the Respondent's liability under the Treaty:\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Law 42 at 50% was lawful, but that Law 42 at 99% was unlawful. Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that Claimant should be compensated for the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador assuming that the wrongful act\u2014 *i.e.*, Law 42 at 99%\u2014did not occur, meaning that Law 42 at 50% would still have been in place at the valuation date of March 2009. For Claimant to be restored to a \u2018but-for' scenario, the fair market value figure of USD 87.8 million must be adjusted to account for the fact that Murphy Ecuador would have continued paying participation under Law 42 at 50% if Law 42 at 99% had never been introduced.1\n\nThe Tribunal noted that it was \"not able to calculate that sum on the basis of the information submitted by the Parties\" and directed the Parties to attempt to agree, within three months of the date of the award, on \"the adjustment that should be made to the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador of USD 87.8 million to account for an ongoing obligation on the part of Claimant to make Law 42 payments at 50% (\" **Adjusted Sum** \").\"2 The Tribunal added its finding that \"Claimant is entitled to any difference between the Adjusted Sum and the purchase price of USD 78.9 million for Murphy Ecuador (\" **Entitlement** \"),\"3 and ordered the Parties to attempt to agree, also within three months, on this amount, as well as on the \"pre- and post-award interest sums referred to in paragraphs 503-504\" of the Partial Final Award.4\n\nPartial Final Award, para. 503.\n\nPartial Final Award, para. 504.\n\nPartial Final Award, para. 504.\n\nPartial Final Award, paras. 504 and 548(v). The Tribunal specified that, failing an agreement of the Parties on these outstanding calculations (Adjusted Sum, Entitlement and pre- and post-award interest sums), it would invite each of them to submit \"simultaneously and within a further month\" a submission setting out its position.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Partial Final Award recounts in detail the procedural history of this arbitration from its commencement\u2014when the Claimant filed its Notice of Arbitration dated 21 September 2011 under the UNCITRAL Rules pursuant to Article VI of the Treaty\u2014until 6 May 2016, when it was issued. The present section summarizes procedural developments since that date.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter dated 6 June 2016, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal \"make an additional award deciding Claimant's claim for post-award interest on the costs of arbitration\" pursuant to Article 37 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, 1976 (the \" **UNCITRAL Rules** \"). In the alternative, and \"in case the Tribunal decided this issue but failed to expressly reflect it\" due to a clerical, typographic, or similar error, the Claimant sought a correction to the Partial Final Award pursuant to Article 36 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 8 June 2016, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Claimant's request and invited the Respondent to submit its comments by 17 June 2016.\n\n9.\n\nBy e-mail dated 10 June 2016, the Respondent advised that the Parties were \"in the process of conferring on the questions put by the Tribunal in the partial award, as well as on the possibility of a truncated process for addressing them\" and requested that the Tribunal \"hold off for the time being on depositing the partial award with the Netherlands courts and until one or both of the parties requests otherwise.\"\n\n10.\n\nBy letter dated 17 June 2016, the Respondent objected to the Claimant's request of 6 June 2016, arguing that \"there is no ground for relief under either Article 36 or 37 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\"\n\n11.\n\nBy e-mails dated 29 June 2016, the Parties, *inter alia*, indicated that they were \"unable to agree upon the calculation of the sums referred to in paragraphs 503-504 of the Partial Final Award\" and requested that, \"with the Tribunal's concurrence,\" they file post-award submissions in connection thereof by 29 July 2016\u2014 *i.e.*, before the expiration of the three-months period provided in the Partial Final Award for them to reach agreement. The Parties reiterated their agreement that the Partial Final Award \"not be deposited with the Netherlands courts until the Tribunal decides the remaining issues.\"\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 1 July 2016, the Tribunal accepted the Parties' request to file post-award submissions. On the same date, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 4 (\" **PO No. 4** \"), in which it denied the Claimant's request of 6 June 2016 on the basis of Articles 36 and 37 of the UNCITRAL Rules. On the same date, the Tribunal requested a supplementary deposit from the Parties to cover the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\" **PCA** \") in this additional phase of the proceedings.\n\n13.\n\nOn 29 July 2016, the Parties submitted their post-award submissions (the \" **Respondent's PostAward Submission** \" and the \" **Claimant's Post-Award Submission**,\" respectively), which the PCA circulated for simultaneous transmission to the Tribunal and the other Party.\n\n14.\n\nBy e-mail dated 5 August 2016, the Respondent wrote in connection with the Claimant's PostAward Submission, notably to request that the Tribunal reject the Claimant's \"entirely unrelated request for the reconsideration of the Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 4 regarding post-award interest on costs,\" and to submit that it \"considers that no further submission on the issues defined in paragraphs 503-504 is necessary\" (the \" **Respondent's E-mail** \").\n\n15.\n\nBy e-mail dated 16 August 2016, after having been invited to do so by the Tribunal, the Claimant provided its comments on the Respondent's E-mail, and agreed that \"absent a request from the Tribunal... no further briefing on paragraphs 503-504 of the Partial Final Award [was] necessary\" (the \" **Claimant's E-mail** \").\n\n16.\n\nBy e-mail dated 17 August 2016, the Presiding Arbitrator informed that the Tribunal \"considers that no further exchange is necessary\" and that it \"will deliberate on the outstanding issues after the holiday period and will issue its award as soon as possible.\"\n\n**IV. REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------\n\n17.\n\nThe Parties' original requests for relief are detailed at paragraphs 121 to 122 of the Partial Final Award. In their Post-Award Submissions, the Parties additionally request the following:\n\nClaimant\n\n1. A final determination of the Adjusted Sum, the Entitlement, and pre- and post-award interest that Ecuador owes Murphy;\n\n2. A reasoned determination of Murphy's non-FET claims regarding Law 42 at 50%, including a declaration that Ecuador breached the Treaty, and the award of all additional damages that flow from such breach(es);\n\n3. Rejection of Ecuador's set-off claim;\n\n4. Reconsideration of the Tribunal's decision in Procedural Order No. 4 and a concomitant award of post-award interest on costs; and\n\n5. Any other relief that the Tribunal may deem appropriate or necessary.5\n\nRespondent\n\n1. A declaration that Ecuador does not owe any compensation to Murphy Ecuador for violation of the Treaty as determined in the Partial Final Award, including any preor post-award interest or costs of arbitration, and that, in particular, as a result of the Tribunal's finding on total damages, Ecuador's liability under paragraph 548(iii) of the Partial Final Award ordering it to pay compensation to Claimant for damages incurred for historical Law 42 payments in the amount of USD 19,971[,]309.00 and related pre- and post-award interest in paragraphs 548(vi) and 548(viii) is fully discharged; and\n\n2. An award [of] costs of the proceeding, including Ecuador's attorney's fees and expenses, in the amount that will fully reflect the relative success of the Parties in the final analysis.6\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 35.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 105\n\n**V. SUMMARIES OF ARGUMENT AND ANALYSIS OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nIn their Post-Award Submissions, the Claimant and the Respondent present their respective proposals for the outstanding calculation of the Adjusted Sum, the Entitlement and pre- and postaward interest referred to in paragraphs 503-504 of the Partial Final Award.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimant provides four alternative scenarios for the calculation, which it summarizes as follows7:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Damages Component** | **Scenario 1** **Law 42 at 99% a Breach (no Extension Value)** | **Scenario 2** **Law 42 at 99% a Breach (with Extension Value)** | **Scenario 3** **Law 42 at 50% a Breach (no Extension Value)** | **Scenario 4** **Law 42 at 50% a Breach (with Extension Value)** |\n| Historical Law 42 Payments | 19,971,309 | 19,971,309 | 90,118,095 | 90,118,095 |\n| Interest on Historical Law 42 Payments | 7,317,721 | 7,317,721 | 33,020,323 | 33,020,323 |\n| **Historical Law 42** **Payments with Interest** | **27,289,031** | **27,289,031** | **123,138,418** | **123,138,418** |\n| Entitlement | - | 16,319,600 | 8,898,694 | 47,017,517 |\n| Interest on Entitlement | - | 5,979,692 | 3,260,585 | 17,227,768 |\n| **Entitlement with Interest** | **-** | **22,299,292** | **12,159,279** | **64,245,285** |\n| **Scenario Total** | **27,289,031** | **49,588,323** | **135,297,697** | **187,383,703** |\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 23.\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent summarizes its proposed calculation as follows8:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Adjusted Sum** **Law 42 at 50%** **(a)** | **Purchase price** **USD 78.9 million** **(b)** | **Entitlement** **as of 12 March 2009** **(c) = (a) - (b)** | **Pre-Award Interest** **as of 6 May 2016** **(d)** | **Total Entitlement value**  **(including Pre-Award Interest)** **(e) = (c) + (d)** |\n| 57,580,092 | 78,908,000 | (21,327,908) | (7,627,705) | (28,955,613) |\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 18.\n\n21.\n\nDifferences in the Parties' respective calculations stem from their disagreement on a number of issues, as discussed more fully in sub-sections 1-3 below. Sub-section 4 addresses the separate issue of post-award interest on costs.\n\n**1. Whether the Tribunal should reconsider its position with respect to the Claimant's non-FET Treaty claims in relation to Law 42 at 50%**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nIn its Partial Final Award, the Tribunal concluded that, as it had found that Ecuador breached the fair and equitable treatment (\" **FET** \") clause of the Treaty, it was \"not necessary to determine Murphy's claims that Ecuador breached other provisions,\" including (i) Article II(3)(c) (the \" **Umbrella Clause** \"); (ii) Article II(3)(a) (full protection and security); (iii) Article II(3)(b) (nonimpairment through arbitrary measures); and (iv) Article III(1) (expropriation).9 This notwithstanding, the Claimant now requests the Tribunal to reconsider its position and to determine its non-FET Treaty claims in relation to Law 42 at 50%\u2014especially its claim under the Umbrella Clause\u2014and to declare that Ecuador violated the Treaty by enacting and enforcing Law 42 at both 99% and 50%.10 The Respondent opposes this request on the basis that it \"proposes that the Tribunal consider factors outside of the principles set forth in paragraphs 503-504\"11 of its Partial Final Award.\n\nPartial Final Award, para. 294\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, paras. 11, 18.\n\nRespondent's E-mail; Respondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 6.\n\n***A. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Tribunal's conclusion that a finding to the effect that Ecuador breached one of the non-FET Treaty provisions would have no impact on damages remains valid in relation to its claims regarding Law 42 at 99%; however, that conclusion does not hold with respect to Law 42 at 50%. The Claimant argues instead that any finding of a breach of a non-FET provision with respect to Law 42 at 50% would have a \"substantial impact\" on damages, including \"on the calculation of the Adjusted Sum and Entitlement.\"12 According to the Claimant, the Tribunal retains jurisdiction to decide its non-FET claims until a full final award is rendered, because it \"chose not to decide those claims in the First Partial Award.\"13\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 9.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 10.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the Partial Final Award is \"consistent with Murphy's position that Law 42 (at both 50% and 99%) violated the Treaty's Umbrella Clause.\"14 It cites excerpts from the award recognizing Murphy's \"right[s]\" and \"guarantee[s]\" under the Participation Contract\u2014rights that \"could not be modified unilaterally,\" the Respondent's attempt to introduce \"a unilateral change\" by virtue of its Law 42 notwithstanding.15 It follows that, although the Tribunal's findings occurred in the context of its analysis of Murphy's FET claim, such reasoning would be consistent with additional findings that the Respondent independently breached the Treaty's Umbrella Clause. Accordingly, the Claimant submits, \"Murphy deems it critical that the Tribunal provide a reasoned decision on Murphy's non-FET claims.\"16\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 12.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 12, *referring to* Partial Final Award, paras. 190, 270-271, 273.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 12.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimant notes that if the Tribunal were to uphold one of the non-FET claims in this way, there would be \"no need to adjust downward the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador\" as of 12 March 2009 (*i.e.*, USD 87.8 million), to account for the impact of Law 42 at 50% as called for in the Partial Final Award (*i.e*., no Adjusted Sum).17 Such a finding would also entitle the Claimant to \"additional damages\" to compensate Murphy for payments it made under Law 42 at 50%.18\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 19.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 19. The Claimant submits that such damages would be easily calculable following the same methodology the Tribunal employed in setting damages for Law 42 at 99%.\" *Id.*\n\n***B. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Respondent opposes the Claimant's request that the Tribunal examine its non-FET Treaty claims in relation to Law 42 at 50%. In its view, any damages calculation incorporating an assumption that Law 42 at 50% was wrongful in light of Ecuador's obligations under the Treaty would be \"impermissible\" in light of the Tribunal's findings on liability in its Partial Final Award.19 It argues that the Claimant's pleadings in this regard amount to an \"attempt[] to divert the Tribunal's attention\" from the principles already set forth in the Partial Final Award with regard to the calculation of damages.20\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 81, 98. The Respondent addressed the question of examining the Claimant's non-FET Treaty claims, in relation to Law 42 at 50%, in response to two of three sets of computations that the Claimant presented to the Respondent during the Parties' post-award consultations. According to the Respondent, those two sets of calculations rest on the assumption that Law 42 at 99% and at 50% are both wrongful. *See* Respondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 78-79.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 6; Respondent's E-mail.\n\n27.\n\nIn response to the Claimant's suggestion that the Tribunal has not yet decided the Claimant's non-FET Treaty claims in relation to Law 42 at 50%, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal clearly decided that:\n\nthe damages alleged by Claimant under the other heads of claim *are the same* as those alleged under its claim for breach of the FET standard; *thus finding a breach under* *Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty as opposed to under any other provision invoked by Claimant has no impact on the calculation of damages*.21\n\nThe Respondent further recalls the Tribunal's finding to the effect that, because the Claimant invoked the violation of multiple Treaty provisions as alternative grounds for finding the Respondent liable under the BIT, \"once the Tribunal has found that one of those alternatives is well-founded, *deciding on the other grounds is no longer part of the Tribunal's mission*. \"22 In this case, the Respondent notes, the Tribunal has already determined that Law 42 at 50% \"was a reasonable measure\" in light of the circumstances,23 making it unnecessary to explicitly address the Claimant's non-FET claims in respect to the legislation.24 In any event, the Respondent notes, the Tribunal did expressly reject some of the Claimant's arguments relating to the Umbrella Clause.25\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 83 *referring to* Partial Final Award, para. 294 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 84 *referring to* Partial Final Award, para. 294 (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para 6.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 85.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 86.\n\n28.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the Claimant could have pursued a request for an additional award under the UNCITRAL Rules if it seriously believed that the Tribunal failed to decide any of its claims.26\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 87.\n\n***C. Analysis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal decided in the Partial Final Award that Ecuador breached the FET standard contained in Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty and that this was sufficient to dispose of all of the Claimant's claims under the Treaty:\n\nAs the Tribunal has found that Ecuador breached Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty, it is not necessary to determine Claimant's claims that Ecuador breached other provisions of the Treaty such as Article II(3)(c) (the \"umbrella\" clause); (2) Article II(3)(a) (full protection and security); (3) Article II(3)(b) (non-impairment through arbitrary measures); and (4) Article III(1) (expropriation). The Tribunal is satisfied that *the* *damages alleged by Claimant under the other heads of claim are the same as those alleged under its claim for breach of the FET standard; thus finding a breach under* *Article II(3)(a) of the Treaty as opposed to under any other provision invoked by Claimant has no impact on the calculation of damages*.27\n\nPartial Final Award, para. 294 (emphasis added).\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with the above, arguing instead that \"a finding that Law 42 at 50% violated any provision of the BIT (other than FET) would indeed have a substantial impact on damages, including on the calculation of the Adjusted Sum and the Entitlement.\"28\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 9.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent, however, rightly points out that the damages alleged by the Claimant under its claim for breach of the FET standard and under the other heads of claim are the same. As such, in finding a breach of the FET standard under Article II(3)(a), the Tribunal effectively addressed all of the Claimant's claims under the Treaty. The Claimant's damages did not consist of \"separate and distinct question[s]\" of liability as the Claimant now suggests. Further, the Respondent correctly recalls the Tribunal's observation in the Partial Final Award that \"since Claimant has relied on the violation of several of the Treaty's provisions as *alternative grounds* for its claim for compensation, once the Tribunal has found that one of those alternative grounds is well-founded, *deciding on the other grounds is no longer part of the Tribunal's mission*.\"29\n\nPartial Final Award, para. 294 (emphasis added).\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimant's claim because it calls for the Tribunal to reconsider what it already decided in the Partial Final Award. Contrary to the Claimant's suggestion that the Tribunal \"chose not to decide\" its non-FET claims,30 the Tribunal considers that it already has determined the extent of the Respondent's liability in the Partial Final Award, under the aegis of the Treaty's FET standard. It would be an unnecessary and duplicative reexamination of the merits if the Tribunal were to consider anew whether the Respondent breached the Treaty's non-FET provisions.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 10.\n\n**2. Whether the value of the Adjusted Sum and the Entitlement should account for the Extension Contract**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nIn its Partial Final Award, the Tribunal adopted Ecuador's \"future free cash flows of Murphy Ecuador between March 2009 and January 2012\" for the purpose of calculating the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as of March 12, 2009, discounting the effect of Law 42.31 According to the Claimant, this calculation should be revised to take into account not only free cash flows through the end of the original term of the Participation Contract, *i.e.*, 2012, but also the extended term to 2018 of the new contractual framework negotiated with Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. (\" **Repsol** \") as part of the Claimant's sale of Murphy Ecuador (the \" **Extension Contract** \"). The Respondent, for its part, disagrees with any such revision (*i.e*., the incorporation of the Extension Contract into the Tribunal's calculation of its \"but-for\" scenario as described in paragraphs 501 and 502 of the Partial Final Award).\n\nPartial Final Award, paras. 501-502.\n\n***A. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimant submits that a fair calculation of the Entitlement, as called for by the Tribunal in its Partial Final Award,32 must consider the value of the contractual extension from 2012 to 2018.33 The Claimant notes in this regard that the Tribunal's assessment of Murphy Ecuador's fair market value\u2014at USD 87.8 million\u2014currently excludes the Extension Contract's value; in its view, however, the Extension Contract conferred \"valuable extension rights on the Consortium, which Repsol realized at the time of the sale and undoubtedly factored into\" the sale price it paid for its rights under the Extension Contract (the \" **Repsol Sale Price** \").34 Accordingly, the Claimant submits, \"the Adjusted Sum must also reflect the value of the contract extension that is included in the Repsol Sale Price but not included in the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as calculated by Ecuador's *quantum* experts and adopted by the Tribunal.\"35 The Claimant considers that the hearing testimony of the Respondent's quantum expert also supports the inclusion of the Extension Contract in the calculation of Murphy's Entitlement.36\n\nPartial Final Award, para. 504.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 21\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, paras. 20, 21.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 21 (emphasis in original).\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 21 *referring to* Hearing Tr. (Day 3), pp. 640:4-641:9; *see also* Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, fn. 23.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the implicit value of the Extension Contract as factored into the Repsol Sale Price amounts to approximately USD 38.1 million. Accordingly, it requests that this amount be \"added to Murphy Ecuador's fair market value in all scenarios before the Repsol Sale Price is deducted from the Adjusted Sum, with concomitant impact on the Entitlement.\"37 Failure to make such an adjustment would result in the Respondent receiving \"credit for a Repsol Sale Price that includes value based on an extension to 2018 as against an Adjusted Sum that only values cash flows under the Participation Contract's original term to January 2012\" and \"unfair undercompensation\" for the Claimant.38\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 22.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 22.\n\n***B. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's assumption that the Extension Contract's value is \"severable from the [Repsol Sale Price] and needs to be added to the Adjusted Sum before calculating the Entitlement value.\"39 It argues that such an assumption (i) exceeds the parameters set out in paragraphs 503 and 504 of the Partial Final Award, (ii) lacks any economic justification, and (iii) contradicts Navigant's first computation as well as the Claimant's previously stated position.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para 79.\n\n37.\n\nThe Respondent describes Navigant's\u2014and, by extension, the Claimant's\u2014approach in the following terms:\n\nThe Third Navigant Assumption calls, in effect, for the deduction of the \"Extension Value\" from the [Repsol Sale Price] and its concomitant discarding from the calculation of the Entitlement. The manner in which Navigant seeks to effectuate that is by adding the so-called Extension Value to the Adjusted Sum before deducting the full [Repsol Sale Price]. In that way, the impact of the \"Extension Value\" in the calculation of the Entitlement is neutralized.40\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 89.\n\n38.\n\nIt attacks this approach on the above-stated three grounds. First, with respect to the parameters set out in paragraphs 503 and 504 of the Partial Final Award, the Respondent observes that \"[t]he only adjustment to Murphy Ecuador's FMV called for by the Tribunal was to account for \u2018an ongoing obligation on the part of Claimant to make Law 42 payments at 50%.'\"41 The Respondent adds that the Tribunal envisaged deducting \"the *full* amount of the SPA sale price in order to calculate the Entitlement.\"42 The Respondent therefore argues that the Claimant's suggestion that only part of the Repsol Sale Price should be credited against Murphy Ecuador's fair market value (under Law 42 at 50%) is inconsistent with the Partial Final Award.43\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 90, *referring to* Partial Final Award, para 504.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 90 (emphasis in original).\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 90; Respondent's E-mail.\n\n39.\n\nSecond, and in any event, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's approach to calculating its Entitlement \"lacks any economic justification.\"44 As noted in the Third Fair Links Report, Navigant has provided no explanation as to why \"the compensatory benefits from the Extension Contract\" received by the Claimant, by virtue of the USD 78.9 million it received as payment for Murphy Ecuador, \"should be eliminated from the actual compensation.\"45\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 91.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 91, *referring to* Third Fair Links Expert Report, para. 100.\n\n40.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that Navigant's approach, as described above, is in \"complete contradiction\" of its \"consistent position in favor of the deduction of the full amount of the SPA sale price from the overall damages claimed.\"46 In this connection, the Respondent notes that \"neither the Claimant nor Navigant ever made such a claim either in the ICSID arbitration or in the previous phase\" of these proceedings.47 This, according to the Respondent, demonstrates the Claimant's adherence to \"the principle of *full* deduction of the SPA sale price from Claimant's overall damages,\" its present submission to the contrary notwithstanding.48\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 92.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 92. *See also* Respondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 93-96.\n\n*See* Respondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 92-95.\n\n41.\n\nIn any event, and out of an \"abundance of caution,\" the Respondent adds that Navigant's computation of the value of the Extension Contract benefit, considered on the merits and independent of Navigant's previous position, \"appears to be seriously flawed.\"49 In this regard, the Respondent points to a series of what it considers to be methodological flaws with the computations presented by the Claimant during the Parties' post-award consultations.50\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, fn. 159.\n\n*See* Respondent's Post-Award Submission, fn. 159 & paras. 99-103.\n\n***C. Analysis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn the Partial Final Award, the Tribunal determined that \"the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador as of March 12, 2009 in the absence of Law 42 was USD 87.8 million.\"51 Further, the Tribunal considered that only *one* adjustment should be made to Murphy Ecuador's fair market value. This was the adjustment to account for the Claimant's ongoing obligation to make Law 42 at 50% payments. Applying the adjustment produces the Adjusted Sum, which in turn, allows for the calculation of the Claimant's Entitlement. This is fully described by the Tribunal at paragraphs 503 and 504 of the Partial Final Award.\n\nPartial Final Award, para. 502.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimant now seeks to include the Extension Contract's value as an additional adjustment. The Tribunal considers that any further adjustment to the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador of USD 87.8 million (*i.e*., an adjustment other than to take into account the Claimant's ongoing obligation to make Law 42 at 50% payments), would be inconsistent with\u2014and amount to a reconsideration of\u2014the Partial Final Award. It, therefore, agrees with the Respondent that the argument raised by the Claimant exceeds the parameters set out in paragraphs 503 and 504 of the Partial Final Award, and rejects the Claimant's claim.\n\n**3. Whether the sale of Murphy Ecuador has a negative or a positive effect on damages**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nThe Parties disagree on how to account for the difference between the Adjusted Sum and the Repsol Sale Price paid by Repsol for Murphy Ecuador on 12 March 2009 (the \" **Repsol Transaction** \"), as called for by the Tribunal in its Partial Final Award. The Respondent argues that the difference is negative; it therefore submits that the Claimant's damages should be decreased, or \"offset,\" in order to avoid over-compensation. The Claimant, in turn, submits that the Respondent's economic analysis lacks merit and maintains that the Tribunal contemplated the Entitlement as an \"additional sum\" to Murphy, rather than a credit favoring Ecuador.\n\n***A. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the difference between the Adjusted Sum and the Repsol Sale Price is negative. Further, it considers that the Tribunal has both the power and the duty, as specified in paragraphs 503 and 504 of its Partial Final Award and guided by general principles of compensation under international law, to \"offset\" this sum from the amount owed to Murphy.\n\ni. The Repsol Transaction fully mitigated the Claimant's damages\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Respondent considers that the Parties have agreed that the Adjusted Sum amounts to USD 57.6 million.52 In support of its claim, the Respondent refers to its Third Fair Links Report and Navigant's first computation presented by the Claimant during the Parties'post-award consultations which, it says, present this amount.53\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 14-15.\n\nThe Respondent addresses the other two computations that the Claimant presented, both of which, in its words, \"radically depart\" from the Tribunal's ruling at Respondent's Post-Award Submission, sec. V. The Respondent's arguments regarding the assumptions underlying these other two computations are summarized in paras. 26-28 and 37-41above.\n\n47.\n\nThe Respondent therefore submits that the difference between the Adjusted Sum\u2014 *i.e*., USD 57.6 million\u2014and the Repsol Sale Price\u2014 *i.e.*, USD 78.9 million\u2014has a negative value of approximately USD 21.3 million.54 In other words, the \"Claimant was paid USD 21.3 million more for Murphy Ecuador than its FMV under Law 42 at 50%.\"55\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 16.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 16.\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Tribunal \"has not decided\" the effect on the Claimant's overall damages of its sale of Murphy Ecuador arising from the Treaty breach,56 and submits that the Repsol Transaction effectively and \"fully mitigated\" the Claimant's damages under Law 42 above 50%, *i.e.*, under Law 42 at 99%. It argues that this point is not in dispute. The Claimant's expert, for example, \"consistently conceptualized Claimant's total loss\" as resulting from the breach taking into account the Repsol Sale Price;57 the Tribunal similarly recognized that the Repsol Transaction had been undertaken by the Claimant to mitigate its losses in response to Law 42 at 99%.58 In light of what the Respondent considers, therefore, to be uniform agreement among the Parties, their experts and the Tribunal, it contends that the transaction's value should be deducted from the damages owed to Murphy.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 20.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 22-25, *referring to* Second Navigant Report, para. 133; *see also* Respondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 29.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 27-28, *referring to* Partial Final Award, para. 446.\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the fact that the Tribunal did not precisely anticipate the mitigating value of the Repsol Transaction cannot prevent it from recognizing it as negative. Indeed, the Tribunal stated that \"any difference\" must be taken into account, including, by implication, a negative one.59 The Respondent therefore rejects the Claimant's assertion that the fact that it already received payment in excess of Murphy Ecuador's fair market value under Law 42 at 50% \"can have no other effect than reducing the Entitlement amount to zero.\"60 In the Respondent's view, such a \"simplistic\" reading would be \"contrary to international law.\"61 In any event, this constitutes an admission from the Claimant that it has \"already been fully compensated\" for its losses.62 The Respondent additionally notes that Navigant itself previously \"acknowledged that the difference between the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador and the USD 78.9 million purchase price paid by Repsol-YPF could yield a negative amount.\"63\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 11.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 5.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 5\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 5.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 30.\n\n50.\n\nAccording to the Respondent's Third Fair Links Report, the \"overall impact\" of the Repsol Transaction on the Claimant's damages yields a negative value of USD 1.8 million as of 6 May 2017, or USD 1.3 million, excluding pre-award interest.64 It follows, in the Respondent's view, that the sale \"more than compensated\" the Claimant for its losses relating to Law 42 at 99%, something which the Respondent suggests the Claimant itself recognized in an internal memorandum.65 Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the Claimant had \"no unsatisfied losses\" as of 12 March 2009 (the date of the Repsol Transaction).66\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 32, *referring to* Third Fair Links Report, para. 67 & p. 16, fig. 3.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 33, *referring to* Third Fair Links Report, para. 70.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 34.\n\n51.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that, as a further result of the full mitigation, no pre- or post-award interest is owed to the Claimant. The Third Fair Links Report states that both \"pre-award and postaward interest rate should apply to a zero value and lead to no overall pre-award and post-award interest.\"67 Applying these rates to a value of zero is appropriate in light of the fact that the USD 7.14 million pre-award interest as described in the Partial Final Award \"is fully mitigated by the USD (7.63) million negative Interest related to the Entitlement.\"68\n\nThird Fair Links Report, para. 72.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 35, *referring to* Third Fair Links Report, para. 73 & tbl. 1.\n\nii. The Tribunal has the power and duty to \"offset\" negative amounts\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal has the power, and indeed the duty, to take the negative Entitlement amount into account in its calculations of the Claimant's losses, and, therefore, of the damages owed to it by Ecuador. It argues that the Tribunal \"expressly reserved the power to \u2018make the necessary findings' in view of the calculation of the Adjusted Sum, the Entitlement and pre-and post-award interest\" in the Partial Final Award.69 Even without this \"reservation of power,\" the Tribunal could, in any event, apply \"those of its inherent powers \u2018instrumental in the adjudication of the main claim,' which include the power to provide redress for the injury actually suffered.\"70\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 62, 69.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 67.\n\n53.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the \"necessary findings\" the Tribunal reserved for this phase of the case include an \"offset\" of the amounts partially awarded in the Partial Final Award:\n\nA finding of such an adjustment is necessary in order to assure that these proceedings, and the Tribunal's legal and factual determinations, do not lead to overcompensation. Otherwise, the outcome of these proceedings, which is still very much within the Tribunal's power to determine, will be contrary to all principles of compensation under International Law as universally recognized, including by Murphy itself.71\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 4.\n\n54.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the applicable \"principle[] of compensation\" under international law is \"full reparation of any loss.\"72 Any such loss, however, must be defined by reference to \"concrete and actual damage incurred.\"73 Accordingly, full reparation requires the avoidance of overcompensation and double recovery,74 as demonstrated by the practice of investment tribunals,75 the Permanent Court of International Justice,76 and the ILC Articles on State Responsibility.77 A corollary to the avoidance of double recovery, the Respondent advances, is the subtraction\u2014 or \"offsetting\"\u2014of benefits against losses, at least where these derive from or share a common factual nucleus.78 It contends that \"any difference\" between the Adjusted Sum and the Repsol Sale Price must be accounted for in order to accurately \"restore[]\" the Claimant to the position in which it would have been but for the Treaty breach,79 including \"all compensatory benefits\" it received from the sale of Murphy Ecuador. The Respondent therefore argues that \"to properly assess Claimant's total loss,\" the negative Entitlement must offset the positive damages value related to historical Law 42 payments.80\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 36.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 36, *referring to* Partial Final Award, para. 425.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 36.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 36-40, *referring to*, among others, *V\u00edctor Pey Casado & Foundation \"Presidente Allende\" v.

Other tribunals have deducted from one head of damages the gains that resulted from awarding compensation for another head of damages to avoid double recovery.83\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 51, *referring to* Partial Final Award, paras. 466-467.\n\nThe Respondent considers the Claimant to share this view, at least in principle (if not in application). *See* Respondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 52.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 53-54, *referring to* Total S.A. v.

The Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 (9 April 2015), para. 104 (RLA-487).\n\n56.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues that the \"Compensatory Benefit\" embedded in the Repsol Sale Price\u2014 *i.e.*, the reason that the purchase price is higher than the Adjusted Sum\u2014is attributable to Ecuador. Citing the Third Fair Links Report, the Respondent notes that \"[t]he reason for this higher value\" derives from \"benefits extended *by Ecuador* to the Consortium members\" under the Extension Contract\u2014providing, *inter alia*, a seven-year extension for the concession, a higher reference price of USD 42.5 per barrel, and division of profits calculated from a more favourable base price.84 The Respondent notes that this\u2014the fact that the sale price incorporated the \"benefits of the Extension Contract granted by Ecuador\"\u2014is not being disputed by the Claimant.85\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 55-56.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 57.\n\n57.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that the \"offsetting\" it seeks will not result in its unjust enrichment. It notes that the Claimant \"effectively admits that the deduction\" would not lead to such a result, and that, in any event, Ecuador would not \"actually receiv[e] any sums\" as a result of a negative offset. Rather, any such offset would merely counterbalance the \"significant benefits\" offered by Ecuador through the Extension Contract.86\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 60.\n\niii. The Tribunal should make a further finding on costs as a result of the full mitigation of the Claimant's damages\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimant to pay the Respondent a portion of the Respondent's costs of arbitration and costs of legal representation and assistance, or order that each Party shall bear its own costs.87 In the Respondent's view, such an order would be consistent with the Tribunal's guiding criterion for the allocation of costs, *i.e.*, the Parties' rate of success in the arbitration.88 The Respondent states that, in this case, the \"full mitigation\" of the Claimant's losses by virtue of the Repsol Transaction (on the understanding that Law 42 at 50% was lawful) necessarily \"entails that Claimant did not prevail on its damages claim;\" this, in turn, necessitates \"a further finding by the Tribunal in its final fixing of the costs of arbitration.\"89 The Respondent argues that both paragraph 504 of the Partial Final Award and the Tribunal's \"inherent power over procedure,\" as codified in Article 15 of the UNCITRAL Rules, empower it to make such a finding.90\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 72.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 72 *referring to* Partial Final Award, para. 546.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 72.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 73 *referring to* Partial Final Award, para. 504; UNCITRAL Rules, Art. 15.\n\n***B. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant submits four alternative damage scenarios for the Tribunal's consideration and rejects the Respondent's proposal that the Entitlement be \"offset\" as untimely and without merit.\n\ni. The Claimant's damage scenarios\n----------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimant provides four alternative scenarios for the calculation of the Adjusted Sum, the Entitlement, and pre- and post-award interest, ranging from approximately USD 27.3 million to USD 187.3 million.91 Those scenarios, as recited in the Claimant's Post-Award Submission, are as follows:\n\n\u2022 Scenario 1: Law 42 at 99% a breach with no consideration of extension value. Assumes that only Law 42 at 99% is a breach and provides no value adjustment for contract extension. Adjusted Sum is USD 57.1 million. Entitlement is USD 0.

The Respondent's proposed \"offset\" is irrelevant, untimely, and invalid\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant objects to the Respondent's proposed \"offset\" of the benefits it alleges the Claimant accrued in respect of the Repsol Transaction as against the amount of the Entitlement, as \"untenable and untimely.\"93\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 24.\n\n62.\n\nThe Claimant describes the Respondent's \"eleventh-hour attempt to convert the [E]ntitlement into a credit\" to be applied against damages as misguided for four reasons.94 First, the Claimant objects to the Respondent's proposition that the Claimant is \"liable to Ecuador\" for having sold its stake in Murphy Ecuador for a price higher than the Respondent's estimation of the company's fair market value at the time of the sale. The Claimant suggests that there is \"no link\" between the historical Law 42 payments and the Entitlement that might otherwise justify an \"offset\" from one category to the other; rather, the two categories of damages are \"separate and distinct.\"95\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, paras. 24-29 (emphasis omitted).\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 26.\n\n63.\n\nSecond, and to similar effect, the Claimant reiterates that the Respondent's \"set-off\" theory wrongly compares \"\u2018apples to oranges' by seeking to offset a Repsol Sale Price that includes substantial value for the extension against an Adjusted Sum that includes none.\"96 In this regard, the Claimant notes its \"disappoint[ment]\" by what it considers to be the Respondent's attempt to \"mislead\" the Tribunal by suggesting that Murphy itself has consistently \"deducted the Repsol Sale Price from its full damages claim, including its claim for historical Law 42 payments.\"97 The Claimant submits that this is \"demonstrably false,\" and refers the Tribunal to the following passage from its Reply on the Merits (the \" **Reply** \"):\n\nEcuador alleges that Murphy's sale of its interest in Block 16 to Repsol resulted in an accounting gain, such that Murphy suffered no damages as a result of Law 42. This is a non-sequitur for two reasons. First, the Repsol sale did not mitigate in any way the US$118 million in additional participation that Murphy paid prior to the sale.98\n\nThe Claimant also recalls that the table of contents to its Reply describes its two pre-interest damages heads as (i) \"Historical Law 42 Payments Should Be Awarded Pre-Tax,\" and (ii) \"Damages Post-March 2009 Should Be Measured as \u2018But For' Cash Flows to January 2012 Less the Actual Proceeds of the Repsol Sale.\"99 This, according to the Claimant, clearly establishes that \"the Repsol Sale Price acted as a mitigation of post -sale forward-looking damages but not of pre-sale historical Law 42 payments.\"100\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 29.\n\nClaimant's E-mail.\n\nClaimant's E-mail (emphasis omitted), *referring to* Reply, para. 26.\n\nClaimant's E-mail.\n\nClaimant's E-mail.\n\n64.\n\nThe third ground on which the Claimant objects to an \"offset\" from the Entitlement is derived from the Partial Final Award itself, which, in the Claimant's view, does not contemplate that the Entitlement \"could work to the detriment of the award of historical Law 42 payments to Murphy.\"101 In this regard, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's suggestion that the Tribunal meant, knowingly or otherwise, to calculate the Entitlement as a credit \"for any negative difference between the adjusted fair market value of Murphy Ecuador and the Repsol Sale Price.\"102 Similarly, it rejects the argument that the Tribunal only referred to the Entitlement as a \"positive potential outcome\" in the Partial Final Award on the theory that it did not foresee that \"application of the 50% rate to Murphy Ecuador's 2009-2012 cash flows might result in a reduction of the Fair Links-calculated FMV of Murphy Ecuador by the only $9 million or so needed to bring the Adjusted Value to less than the Repsol Sale Price.\"103\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 27.\n\nClaimant's E-mail.\n\nClaimant's E-mail.\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimant suggests that the Tribunal's formulation \"meant exactly what it said,\" namely (in its reading) that the Entitlement could \"only lead to further damages to Murphy\" and not to a credit in Ecuador's favour.104 According to the Claimant, the \"very definition\" of the Entitlement connotes \"something to be awarded as an additional sum,\" rather than a credit to be subtracted from the Claimant's damages.105 Had the Tribunal foreseen the possibility that the Adjusted Sum could be less than the Repsol Sale Price\u2014 *i.e.*, yielding a negative number\u2014 the Claimant considers that it would have suggested as much in the Partial Final Award.106\n\nClaimant's E-mail.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 27.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 27.\n\n66.\n\nFinally and in any event, the Claimant submits that, as Ecuador never raised the possibility of an \"offset\" at an earlier stage of the proceedings, the Respondent can no longer \"raise it now.\"107 Accordingly, it submits that the Respondent's set-off claim is without merit and procedurally inadmissible.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 28.\n\n***C. Analysis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Claimant admits that, if it is assumed that only Law 42 at 99% is a breach of the Treaty and no adjustment is to be made to the fair market value of Murphy Ecuador for the Extension Contract, the Adjusted Sum\u2014taking into account the Claimant's ongoing obligation to make Law 42 at 50% payments\u2014is USD 57.1 million,108 which is less than the USD 87.8 million value the Tribunal found at paragraph 502 of the Partial Final Award.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 23.\n\n68.\n\nThe difference between the Adjusted Sum (USD 57.1 million) and the Repsol Sale Price (USD 78.9 million) is negative. According to the Claimant, its Entitlement is therefore zero.109 The Respondent, on the other hand, considers that the negative difference between the two amounts should be taken into consideration by the Tribunal in its calculation of the Claimant's losses, arguing that, in selling Murphy Ecuador for USD 78.9 million, the Claimant fully mitigated its damages under Law 42 above 50%.110 The Respondent, therefore, introduces a new offset claim and also requests that the Tribunal make a new finding on costs as the result of what they refer to as the \"full mitigation of the Claimant's damages.\"111 The Claimant disputes this on the basis that the Repsol Sale Price acts to mitigate post-sale forward-looking damages, but not pre-sale historical Law 42 payments.112\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 23.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, paras. 22-25, *referring to* Second Navigant Report, para. 133 *; see also* Respondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 29.\n\nRespondent's Post-Award Submission, para. 72.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 26.\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant's analysis. More precisely, as summarized above, the Claimant invokes four grounds to object to the Respondent's position.113 The Tribunal finds that the first three grounds are well-founded. In particular, it agrees with the Claimant that the Respondent's set-off theory wrongly seeks to establish a \"link between the historical Law 42 payments and the Entitlement\" in order to justify an offset. As stated by the Claimant, the Repsol Sale Price acts to mitigate post-sale forward-looking damages, and not pre-sale historical Law 42 payments. The two categories of damages are \"separate and distinct.\"\n\nParas. 62-66 above.\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent's submission that the negative difference between the Adjusted Sum and the Repsol Sale Price can be \"offset\" from the Claimant's damages for historical Law 42 payments. Instead, it agrees with the Claimant that the Entitlement referred to at paragraph 504 of the Partial Final Award is zero. As there is no \"mitigation\" of the Claimant's losses, the Respondent's request for a \"further finding by the Tribunal in its final fixing of the costs of arbitration\" ordering the Claimant to pay the Respondent a portion of the Respondent's costs of arbitration and costs of legal representation and assistance, or ordering that each Party shall bear its own costs for the entirety of the proceedings, is also rejected.\n\n**4. Whether the Tribunal should reconsider its decision in PO No. 4 regarding post-award interest on costs**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Parties continue to dispute whether the Tribunal should award post-award interest on costs. The Claimant maintains that such interest should be awarded and accordingly requests a \"reconsideration of the Tribunal's decision in Procedural Order No. 4 and a concomitant award of post-award interest on costs.\"114 The Respondent contends that the Claimant's application is procedurally improper.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, paras. 34-35.\n\n***A. Claimant's Position***\n----------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Tribunal should revisit its decision in PO No. 4 in order to award post-award interest on costs.115\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 34.\n\n73.\n\nIt suggests that, contrary to the finding in PO No. 4 that no post-award interest had been specifically requested in its prior pleadings, the Claimant had in fact raised the issue at an earlier stage of the proceedings.116 In particular, the Claimant notes that in its prayer for relief in its Reply, it requested that the Tribunal award it \"all of its costs of this proceeding, including its attorney's fees and expenses; and on the foregoing amounts compound interest, including... post-Award interest until the date of Ecuador's final satisfaction of the Award.\"117 It adds that \"[t]here is simply no reason to penalize Murphy based on a mistaken belief that no specific request for post-award interest on costs was made, when plainly one was.\"118\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, paras. 32-34, *referring to* Reply, para. 782; Claimant's First Post-Hearing Brief, para. 149; Claimant's Second Post-Hearing Brief, para. 61.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 32, *referring to* Reply, para. 782.\n\nClaimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 34.\n\n74.\n\nFurther, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's assertion that the Claimant's request is beyond the scope of the Tribunal's inquiry.119 Rather, the Claimant submits, it is the Respondent who has gone beyond the scope of the Tribunal's instructions by\u2014in addition to seeking reconsideration of the Tribunal's award of historical Law 42 payment damages\u2014requesting the Tribunal to reconsider its award of pre-award interest on those damages, as well as its costs award.120\n\nClaimant's E-mail.\n\nClaimant's E-mail.\n\n***B. Respondent's Position***\n------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent considers the Claimant's request for reconsideration of the Tribunal's decision in its PO No. 4 to be \"extraneous,\" \"unrelated,\" and \"merely another effort to create an artificial situation to counterbalance the implications of paragraph 503-504.\"121 In any event, it notes, the Claimant has \"offered no argument or legal authority to justify why reconsideration is available or appropriate in these circumstances.\"122 Instead, the Claimant's request is based on the same \"prayer for relief language\" already considered and decided upon previously.123\n\nRespondent's E-mail.\n\nRespondent's E-mail.\n\nRespondent's E-mail, *referring to* Claimant's Letter dated 6 June 2016, fn. 1; Respondent's Letter dated 17 June 2016, fn. 12; Claimant's Post-Award Submission, para. 32.\n\n***C. Analysis of the Tribunal***\n---------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that allowing the Claimant's claim would amount to a reconsideration of the Partial Final Award and of the Tribunal's order in PO No. 4. It therefore rejects the Claimant's claim and reiterates its position that \"[t]he reason why the Tribunal has not granted post-award interest on costs is that no specific claim in this respect was before the Tribunal at the time of rendering its award.\"124\n\nPO No. 4, Section IV.\n\n**5. Costs of arbitration**\n---------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that it already awarded costs for these proceedings in the Partial Final Award for costs incurred up to the date of its issuance. This decision concerns costs that have been incurred since that time and calls for an evaluation under Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules of who the successful Party is in respect of this additional phase of the proceedings.\n\n78.\n\nWhile the Claimant has prevailed overall in securing an additional significant award of damages in this new phase, this was the consequence of the Partial Final Award in its favour and the Claimant prevailing against one of the Respondent's arguments. However, the Tribunal has not accepted the Claimant's various other arguments that would have increased its overall damages.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore finds that there is no clearly successful Party in respect of this phase of the proceedings and determines that the costs of arbitration shall be borne equally by the Parties.\n\n80.\n\nSimilarly, the Tribunal finds no reason to apportion the costs of legal representation and assistance between the Parties, and decides that each Party shall bear its own legal costs in respect of this phase of the proceedings.\n\n81.\n\nThe Parties deposited an additional EUR 150,000 (EUR 75,000 each) to cover the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the PCA in this phase of the proceedings.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal has fixed the costs of the arbitration for this phase of the proceedings in the amount of EUR 56,804.87, broken down as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arbitrator Fees |\n| Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r | EUR 15,000.00 |\n| Me Yves Derains | EUR 2,850.00 |\n| Professor Bernard Hanotiau | EUR 20,180.00 |\n| Expenses |  |\n| (bank charges, office supplies, courier, translation, etc.) | EUR 4,607.36 |\n| Registry Fees |  |\n| PCA | EUR 14,167.51 |\n| **TOTAL** | **EUR 56,804.87** |\n\n83.\n\nThe remaining balance on deposit shall be reimbursed in equal shares to the Parties.\n\n**VI. DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n--------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal hereby:\n\n(i) DISMISSES the Claimant's request for the Tribunal to provide a reasoned decision on its non-FET Treaty claims.\n\n(ii) DISMISSES the Claimant's claim that the value of the Adjusted Sum and Entitlement should account for the Extension Contract.\n\n(iii) DISMISSES the Respondent's proposition that the negative difference between the Adjusted Sum and the Repsol Sale Price should be \"offset\" from the Claimant's damages for historical Law 42 payments.\n\n(iv) DECLARES that the Adjusted Sum and the Entitlement referred at paragraph 504 of the Partial Final Award amount to USD 57.1 million and zero, respectively.\n\n(v) DECLARES that, as a result of the Entitlement amounting to zero, there shall be no pre-award or post-award interest on it and the Sum of Figure A and Figure B referred to at paragraphs 522 and 548(viii) of the Partial Final Award shall amount to USD 7,136,121.\n\n(vi) DISMISSES the Claimant's request that the Tribunal revisit its decision in PO No. 4 and award post-award interest on costs.\n\n(vii) ORDERS each Party to bear 50% of the costs of arbitration and each Party to bear the costs of its own legal representation and assistance for this additional phase of the proceedings.\n\n(viii) DISMISSES all other claims."}]}
