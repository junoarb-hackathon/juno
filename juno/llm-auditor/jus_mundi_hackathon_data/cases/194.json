PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n----------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 4 February 2014, Blusun, Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein submitted a Request for Arbitration before the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes  ***(\u2018ICSID\u2019)***  (the  ***\u2018Request\u2019***  or  ***\u2018RFA\u2019).***  The Request was submitted pursuant to Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty *(**'ECT'*** or  ***'Treaty').***7 The Claimants allege that their claim arises from a dispute between \u2018natural person[s] having the citizenship or nationality\u2019 of contracting parties to the ECT, with respect to \u2018\"Investments\" associated with an \"Economic activity\" in the energy sector in the \"Area\" of a Contracting Party.\u20198 The dispute concerns certain regulatory measures and judicial decisions that allegedly had the effect of frustrating the Claimants\u2019 investments in a 120-megawatt **('MW')** solar energy project in the Puglia region of Italy (hereafter the *Puglia Project,* or *the Project).* The Claimants argue that measures adopted successively by the Italian Constitutional Court, by the Italian Government and by the Commune breached the fair and equitable treatment standard set forth in Article 10(1) of the ECT, and/or constituted measures \u2018having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation\u2019 within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the ECT.9 The Claimants estimate the damages suffered as a result of those measures at some \u20ac187.8 million.10\n\nEnergy Charter Treaty, 17 December 1994, 2080 UNTS 95, Exhibit CL-1.\n\nRequest, paras. 90-105.\n\nMemorial, paras. 411 *et seq.*\n\nIbid., para. 505(b); Reply, para. 419(b).\n\n7.\n\nOn 21 February 2014, ICSID\u2019s Secretary-General registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nThe Parties agreed to constitute the Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal was to consist of three arbitrators, one appointed by each party and the President of the Tribunal appointed by agreement of the Parties.\n\n9.\n\nOn 24 March 2014, the Claimants appointed Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, as an arbitrator. On 7 May 2014, the Respondent appointed Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a national of France, as an arbitrator. On 12 June 2014, the Parties agreed to appoint Judge James Crawford AC, a national of Australia, as President of the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nOn 12 June 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings  ***(\u2018Arbitration Rules'******),***  notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date, and circulated the arbitrators\u2019 declarations under Rule 6(2) of the Arbitration Rules. Mr. Benjamin Garel, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal with representatives of the Parties was held by telephone conference on 28 July 2014. During that conference, the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that they had no objection to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nAlso at the first session, it was agreed that this arbitration would be conducted in English and that it would proceed in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006. The Tribunal discussed with the Parties a previously circulated provisional agenda and draft procedural order, and established by agreement a timetable for this proceeding that was incorporated in Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n13.\n\nPursuant to the timetable established at the first session (which was amended on 28 July 2015, following letters from the Parties of 16 July 2015 and 22 July 2015), the Parties made the following written submissions:\n\n(a) The Claimants submitted their Memorial on the Merits on 31 July 2014, accompanied by the witness statements of Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein, and by the expert report of Carlos Lapuerta.\n\n(b) The Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Merits on 19 December 2014.\n\n(c) The Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits on 8 May 2015, accompanied by the expert report of Paolo Marino, the rebuttal expert report of Carlos Lapuerta, and the second witness statements of Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein.\n\n(d) The Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits on 16 October 2015, accompanied by the expert report of Luca Benedetti.\n\n14.\n\nOn 22 September 2015, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that Francisco Abriani, ICSID Legal Counsel, would replace Benjamin Garel as Secretary of the Tribunal in this proceeding.\n\n15.\n\nOn 23 October 2015, the European Commission (the  ***\u2018EC\u2019***  or  ***\u2018Commission')***  filed an \u2018Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party\u2019 (the  ***\u2018Commission\u2019s Application')***  pursuant to Rule 37 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n16.\n\nOn 24 October 2015, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their observations regarding the Commission\u2019s Application by 28 October 2015.\n\n17.\n\nOn 28 October 2015, the Respondent submitted the statements of Mr. Benedetti and Mr. Bacchiocchi in their capacity as expert and fact witness, respectively.\n\n18.\n\nOn 28 October 2015, the Claimants submitted their observations regarding the Commission\u2019s Application, and requested that the application be dismissed. On the same date, the Respondent submitted its observations regarding the Commission\u2019s Application, and requested that it be accepted.\n\n19.\n\nOn 30 October 2015, the Tribunal accepted the Commission\u2019s Application *de bene esse* and fixed 12 November 2015 for the filing of the Commission\u2019s further observations, without deciding at that stage whether the Commission\u2019s written submissions would be incorporated into the record.\n\n20.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimants filed a request for the Tribunal to decide on the admissibility of new evidence, specifically a further report of 2011 from Watson, Farley and Williams.\n\n21.\n\nOn 4 November 2015, the Respondent filed observations on the Claimants\u2019 request of 30 October 2015.\n\n22.\n\nOn 5 November 2015, the Tribunal ruled that the new evidence was admissible. As a result, on the same date the Claimants filed the Opinion of Eugenio Tranchino, of Watson, Farley and Williams, dated 20 May 2011. This document was submitted as Exhibit C-357.\n\n23.\n\nOn 12 November 2015, the Commission filed a submission regarding the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 claims (the  ***\u2018Commission\u2019s Submission\u2019),***  while purportedly reserving \u2018the right to request leave to intervene also on points of substance\u2019 in the event that the Tribunal decided it had jurisdiction.\n\n24.\n\nOn the same date, the Respondent submitted further observations regarding the Commission\u2019s Application. The Respondent requested that the Tribunal \u2018allow a round of written memoires by the Parties, irrespective of its final decision as for the intervention of the European Commission in the procedure\u2019, and that the hearing scheduled to take place between 30 November and 4 December 2015 be postponed.\n\n25.\n\nOn 13 November 2015, the Parties and the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing conference in which they discussed arrangements for the hearing on jurisdiction and merits, and issues arising from the Commission\u2019s Application.\n\n26.\n\nOn 18 November 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, deciding to postpone the hearing initially scheduled to take place between 30 November and 4 December 2015, and inviting the Respondent and the Claimants to submit their positions regarding the Commission\u2019s Submission by 22 January and 26 February 2016, respectively.\n\n27.\n\nOn 22 January 2016, the Respondent submitted its \u2018position on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal over intra-EU disputes\u2019, substantially incorporating the EC\u2019s views.\n\n28.\n\nOn 26 February 2016, the Claimants submitted their \u2018observations on the EC\u2019s *amicus curiae* brief\u2019, rejecting the Commission\u2019s Submission as to the substance.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter of 10 March 2016, the Respondent requested \u2018to discuss jurisdictional matters and have a Tribunal decision on these, prior to any discussion on the merits of the case.\u2019\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of 16 March 2016, the Claimants opposed the Respondent\u2019s request of 10 March 2016.\n\n31.\n\nOn 19 March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, allowing the introduction of the Commission\u2019s Submission of 12 November 2015 to the record in this proceeding pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the ICSD Arbitration Rules. In the same order, the Tribunal reserved for a later date its decision regarding the costs incurred as a result of the Commission\u2019s application.\n\n32.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal also issued Procedural Order No. 4, rejecting the Respondent\u2019s request to bifurcate the proceeding and reserving for a later date its decision regarding the costs incurred as a result of the Respondent\u2019s request.\n\n33.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and the merits was held between 25 and 28 April 2016 at the World Bank in Paris, France.

At the beginning of the hearing, on 25 April 2016, the Claimants asked the other two members of the Tribunal to go forward with the hearing as planned, noting that the Parties had already given their consent to proceed with the hearing in such circumstances at paragraph 4.1 of Procedural Order No. I,11 which provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n... in the event of unexpected health or other serious issues concerning a Member making him unable to be present, the other two Members shall exercise their judgment as to whether to sit with two Members. The Parties shall be informed of such circumstances beforehand.12\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 4:18-5:14 (Legum).\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, para. 4.1.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimants also noted that this hearing had already been postponed once.13\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 8:19 - 9:9 (Legum).\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent, in turn, noted as follows:\n\nWe also know, of course, the text of the Procedural Order No. 1.... in any event, we do recognise that we are in your hands. My only point at this stage would be: we are not speaking about one sitting of the Tribunal; we are speaking of the only hearing that we have, where we discuss everything at once. Of course Professor Dupuy can read the transcript, but it\u2019s absolutely not the same thing as being able to dialogue, to see each other in our eyes, to make questions one after the other, and to interact. It\u2019s not the same. And I think arbitration has a characteristic: the extreme relevance of this phase is especially when you speak with the witnesses and the experts. So for us, we do not feel that we really can proceed with the hearing without one of the three members. It\u2019s too important for him to be present to really understand the way we discuss the case. So we would really oppose to that. We are in your hands, so you take the decision of course.14\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 6:15-16 and 7:2-7:19 (Malaguti).\n\n37.\n\nIn making a decision, the other two members of the Tribunal also considered the views of Professor Dupuy, who agreed that pursuant to paragraph 4.1 of Procedural Order No. 1 the other two members of the Tribunal could proceed with the hearing in his absence.\n\n38.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal noted that the Parties\u2019 agreement, as expressed in Procedural Order No. 1, is compatible with Rules 14 and 20(1)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n39.\n\nActing in accordance with paragraph 4.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, and after hearing the Parties, the other two members decided to proceed with the opening submissions of the Parties and the hearing of witnesses but to postpone closing submissions until a date to be fixed, when all members of the Tribunal could be present. The possibility was left open that the Tribunal might recall one or more witnesses should Professor Dupuy, after reading the transcripts, wish to put further questions. Subsequently, the Tribunal informed the Parties that this would not be necessary.15\n\nLetter to the Parties dated 13 May 2016.\n\n40.\n\nThe President of the Tribunal communicated the Tribunal\u2019s decision to the Parties as follows:\n\nThis is obviously a regrettable situation. To postpone the hearing at this stage would be a second postponement, as pointed out, and would involve extra costs. On the other hand, the Respondent is in principle entitled, subject to the rules, to a hearing by the Tribunal. But there has been agreement between the parties in a quite carefully worded provision specifically envisaging a situation in which unexpected health problems supervene. One other consideration is that the members of the Tribunal have many commitments, and scheduling another five-day hearing this side of the summer is going to be difficult.\n\nSo the Tribunal has decided, in the exercise of the discretion conferred by the rules, to go ahead, but to go ahead as a truncated Tribunal with a truncated hearing. What we propose is that we would have the openings today \u2014 it is traditional in openings that there\u2019s not detailed questioning, but questioning more by way of clarification - to hear the witnesses, and then to adjourn. The hearing would therefore last for three and a half days as scheduled.\n\nWe would then reconvene as soon as a date can be found for the closings, which will enable Professor Dupuy to read the transcripts. If there is a compelling case for a witness to return to the chair for questions from Professor Dupuy, that can be done. So there would be a further hearing of a day, or perhaps a day and a half, in which the closings would be conducted in the presence of Professor Dupuy. That would enable him \u2014 especially if we schedule a bit longer for the closing - to fully participate.\n\nWe think that that solution, subject to the comments of the parties, addresses the problems so far as we can do so. It reduces the wasted costs of this hearing. It makes it much easier for us to schedule a resumed hearing in the next couple of months. I don\u2019t know when that will be because we haven\u2019t been able to get in touch with Professor Dupuy, but obviously we will correspond on that. It enables Professor Dupuy to participate fully in the closing and to ask questions, and if necessary gives him a bit more time to do that. Subject to the comments, that\u2019s the Tribunal\u2019s decision, unless the parties have compelling reasons not to adopt that.16\n\nThe Claimants stated that \u2018the solution that the Tribunal has proposed is a reasonable one and we would endorse it.\u201917 Following further exchanges with the Tribunal and counsel for the Claimants, the Respondent stated:\n\nThank you Mr. President. We can start if you want. We spoke with our principals in Rome; they were not so happy but the decision is taken. So let\u2019s go on.\"18\n\nTranscript, Day 1,9:18-11:13 (President).\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 15:13-15 (Legum).\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 18:12-15 (Fiorentino).\n\n41.\n\nThe hearing was resumed on 21 and 22 June in Paris, in the presence of the entire Tribunal, at which the Parties presented their closing arguments and submissions according to an agreed timetable. In doing so they addressed, *inter alia,* a list of questions provided in advance by the Tribunal. Attending the hearing were:\n\nTribunal Members\n\n\u2022 Judge James Crawford AC, President of the Tribunal  \n\u2022 Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov, Arbitrator  \n\u2022 Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy, Arbitrator\n\nICSID Secretariat\n\n\u2022 Mr. Francisco Abriani, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\nAppearing on behalf of the Claimants:\n\n\u2022 Mr. Barton Legum, Dentons Europe LLP  \n\u2022 Ms. Anne-Sophie Dufetre, Dentons Europe LLP  \n\u2022 Mr. Augustin Barrier, Dentons Europe LLP  \n\u2022 Mr. Niccolo Castagno, Dentons Europe LLP  \n\u2022 Mr. Pierre Esteve, Dentons Europe LLP  \n\u2022 Mr. Jean-Pierre Lecorcier, Claimant  \n\u2022 Mr. Michael Stein, Claimant\n\nAppearing on behalf of the Respondent:\n\n\u2022 Avv.

Giacomo Aiello, Avvocatura dello Stato  \n\u2022 Prof. Dr. Maria Chiara Malaguti, External Counsel to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs  \n\u2022 Avv.

Eskosol (now in liquidation and under the control of an Italian liquidator appointed by an Italian court) sought permission to intervene as a non-disputing party under Rule 37(2) of the Arbitration Rules. Eskosol had previously commenced its own ICSID arbitration, as a subsidiary of Blusun, relying on the same facts against Italy as Blusun has done. In short, it submitted that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction and/or the Blusun claim is inadmissible because the Claimants are \u2018seeking damages to which only Eskosol is entitled, which will cause prejudice to Eskosol, its creditors and the Non-Party Shareholders.\u201919\n\nEskosol S.p.A. (in liquidation), Application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), 21 June 2016, para. 5. The Non-Party Shareholders are two Italian nationals together holding 20% of the shares in Eskosol.\n\n43.\n\nHaving consulted the Parties and received concordant oral and written submissions from them, the Tribunal rejected Eskosol\u2019s application, on the following grounds:\n\n6. The Tribunal notes that, pursuant to Rule 37(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, it \"shall ensure that the non-disputing party submission does not disrupt the proceeding or unduly burden or unfairly prejudice either party.\"\n\n7. The Tribunal also notes that Eskosol\u2019s Application was submitted extraordinarily late and that there is no excuse for the lateness. The existence of this proceeding is public and has been known for a long time. Moreover, Eskosol itself has been aware of this proceeding for quite some time: it has initiated other ICSID proceedings against the same Respondent and, as Respondent stated at the hearing, Respondent offered to Eskosol to consolidate the two cases.\n\n8. The Tribunal further notes that both parties agree that Eskosol\u2019s Application should be rejected on the basis that it would disrupt the proceedings.20\n\nThe Respondent, in arguing for the rejection of Eskosol\u2019s application, added that:\n\nAccording to Rule 37(2), a non-disputing party can be admitted if this is not a party to the proceeding, or linked to this. As the Respondent has stated when justifying its proposal for consolidation to the Counsels of both the Claimants and Eskosol, and as it was reiterated in Italy\u2019s letter to the Tribunal of March 17th to answer the Claimants\u2019 comments to its request for bifurcation and information about request for consolidation, *\u2018Eskosol is that very same company that the Claimants define as their Italian vehicle for the purported investment in Italy.*\u2019 Eskosol could consequently not take advantage of Article 37(2) because it pertains to the same business entity as Blusun. As for international investment law, Blusun and Eskosol are the same entity.21\n\nProcedural Order No. 5, 8 July 2016.\n\nLetter from the Respondent to the Tribunal, 30 June 2016.\n\n44.\n\nNeither Party requested post-hearing briefs, nor did the Tribunal see any need for them.\n\n45.\n\nOn 18 July 2016, the Claimants submitted an application for leave to introduce to the record the decision on jurisdiction in the case *RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited, and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.d.r.l.* v. *Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30), dated 6 June 2016, as a new legal authority. After having heard the Respondent on the Claimants\u2019 request, the Tribunal admitted to the record the new legal authority submitted by the Claimants as Exhibit CL-255 and invited the Parties to submit observations on its content. The Claimants submitted very brief observations on 18 August 2016. The Respondent submitted its observations on 5 September 2016.\n\n46.\n\nOn 1 August 2016, the Claimants filed their submission on costs. The Respondent did not make any submission on costs.\n\n47.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Tribunal believes the Parties have each had a full opportunity to present their case, as they each confirmed at the end of the resumed hearing.22\n\nTranscript, Day 6, 97: 5-8 (Legum), 97: 9-16 (Malaguti).\n\nIII. RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE PARTIES\n---------------------------------\n\n1. The Claimants\u2019 request for relief\n------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nIn their Reply, the Claimants requested an Award:\n\na. Declaring that the Italian Republic has breached its obligations under Part III of the Energy Charter Treaty;\n\nb. Ordering the Italian Republic to pay compensation corresponding to the loss of investment made and to the capital gains that the Claimants were unable to realize on their investments, in an amount to be proven at the hearing but which the Claimants presently estimate to be EUR 187.8 million;\n\nc. Ordering the Italian Republic to pay interest on the above sum from the date of the first breach to the date of the award at the rate for three-month Italian bonds, compounded monthly;\n\nd. Ordering the Italian Republic to pay the expenses incurred by the Claimants in connection with these proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention;\n\ne. Ordering the Italian Republic to pay interest on the sums awarded at the rate for three-month Italian bonds, compounded monthly, from the date of the Award until its full discharge by Italy;\n\nf. Ordering that all sums awarded be paid to a subaccount established for this case by the Fund for Lawyers\u2019 Pecuniary Payments *(Caisse des reglements pecuniaires de la profession d\u2019avocat)* maintained by the Bar of Paris, France *(Ordre des Avocats de Paris)',*\n\ng. Ordering such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate in the circumstances.23\n\nReply, para. 419.\n\n49.\n\nIn closing, the Claimants reaffirmed these submissions:\n\nThe purpose of a closing statement is to review the evidence presented at the hearing and to provide the parties\u2019 views on the implications of that evidence for the legal issues to be decided. This will be the principal focus of our closing statement this morning. We will generally not repeat today what we said in our opening or in our written submissions, except to respond to statements made during the hearing. The Tribunal should bear in mind, however, that we continue to rely on our prior oral and written submissions.24\n\nTranscript, Day 5, 3:4-13 (Legum).\n\n2. The Respondent\u2019s request for relief\n--------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent requested the Tribunal as follows:\n\na. Decline jurisdiction to decide, as the Project does not meet the conditions of an investment that can be protected under the ICSID and the ECT.\n\nb. Alternatively, decline jurisdiction to decide, as the alleged investment was created in violation of the national law; of the national and international principles of good faith; of the ECT rules on environmental protection.\n\nc. In a further alternative, decline admissibility of protection of the Claimants\u2019 alleged interests since these are barred from seeking relief because of their unlawful conduct when constituting the alleged investment.\n\nd. Should the Tribunal decide to have jurisdiction on the case, declare, on the merits, that all the claims of the Claimants, both under Article 10(1) and article 13 of the ECT, are unfounded, since there completely lacks any causal link between the challenged Respondent\u2019s conduct and the outcomes of the Project; that, in any case, the Respondent\u2019s conduct does not constitute a violation of such rules.\n\ne. In this context, declare the witness statements as submitted by the Claimants both in the Memorial and the Reply as unfit to prove evidentiary facts since Mr Lecorcier and Mr Stein are party to the arbitral proceedings, and the requests for damages not supported by consistent evidence.\n\nf. In the unfortunate event that the Tribunal were to recognize legitimacy to one of the claims of the Claimants and recognize some form of compensation to the Claimants, declare appropriate the calculations of the damage and the interest proposed by the Respondent, including for calculation of interest.\n\ng. However exclude from the amount of compensation the part of contributory fault attributable to the conduct of the Claimants, whose responsibility in the negative outcomes of the Project is far superior to that in any way attributable to the Respondent.\n\nh. Ordering the Claimants to pay the expenses incurred by the Italian Republic in connection with these proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.25\n\nRejoinder, para. 285.\n\n51.\n\nIn closing, the Respondents reaffirmed these submissions:\n\nItaly firmly believes that this hearing has fully demonstrated the inconsistency of Blusun, Mr Lecorcier and Mr Stein\u2019s claims. Therefore, no wrongful acts have been committed by Italy. No violations by Italy of Articles 10 and 13 of the Energy Charter Treaty have been proven. These closing statements will be devoted to summarising what emerged in the last hearing, underlying the reasons why the Respondent has no responsibility for the failure of Claimants\u2019 project. In any case, it has to be clearly stated that the Respondent, even if in these closing statements it will not treat each single point of its written submissions, does not renounce to any of its arguments, which are entirely recalled here.26\n\nTranscript, Day 5, 130:23 - 131:13 (Palmieri).\n\nIV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n----------------------\n\n52.\n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide a brief account of the factual background to the dispute. There are no major differences between the Parties as to the events described in the section. There are, however, significant differences as to the legal consequences of the actions taken and not taken, as will be seen.\n\nA. The 120 MW project\n---------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe dispute concerns a 120-MW energy project in the Region of Puglia, in the municipalities of Brindisi and Mesagne (Province of Brindisi), Italy (hereafter the  ***\u2018Puglia Project\u2019***  or the  ***\u2018Project\u2019).***  According to the Claimants, the Project consisted in joining approximately 120 photovoltaic plants to each other and to two substations for connection to the national grid.27 Each of the photovoltaic plants had a capacity of just under 1 MW.28 Together, the plants would have generated approximately 120 MW.29\n\nMemorial, paras. 5, 120; Rejoinder, para. 12(a).\n\nSummary Table of DI A Authorizations, Exhibit C-l 1 and DIA Applications without Correspondence, 20082009, Exhibit C-l3.\n\nMemorial, para. 120.\n\n54.\n\nThe photovoltaic plants included in the Claimants\u2019 Project had been initially developed by 12 local companies (special purpose vehicles or  ***\u2018SPVs\u2019)***  under the aegis of local investors. Between 2008 and 2009, these companies had acquired certain rights and permits for the development of the plants. As explained in more detail below, these were rights over the land where the plants would be built, construction permits, and permits for connecting each plant to the local medium-voltage grid.\n\nB. The Claimants\u2019 involvement in the Project\n--------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nOn 23 September 2009, Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein, through a Swiss company that they own and control named Energy Solution Concept  ***(\u2018ESCO\u2019),30*** signed a non-exclusive memorandum of understanding with Oikonomia Dante and Partners  ***(\u2018Oikonomia\u2019),***  an Italian consultancy firm. The stated purpose of this memorandum was the development of three large scale projects for the production of energy based on photovoltaic modules in Southern Italy.31 Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein eventually decided to pursue only one of those projects: the 120 MW project in Puglia.32\n\nLecorcier WS1, para. 23; Stein WS1, para. 16. See also Memorial, paras. 38, 136.\n\nMemorandum of Understanding between FFA Invest and ESCO, Exhibit C-35, p. 1. See also Memorial, para. 136.\n\nLecorcier WS1, para. 63; Stein WS1, para. 54. See also Memorial, paras. 137, 168.\n\n56.\n\nIn order to do so, the investors had to purchase the SPVs that held the rights and permits for the development of the plants.33 They also had to build two substations to connect the solar plants to the national grid, and medium-voltage grids (or \u2018rings\u2019) to connect the solar plants to each other and to the two substations.34\n\nStein WS1, para. 42. See also Memorial, para. 139.\n\nStein WS1, para. 27; Lecorcier WS1, para. 46. See also Memorial, paras. 5, 126-127.\n\n57.\n\nOn 27 November 2009, Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein signed another memorandum of understanding pursuant to which ESCO would grant a \u20ac758,000 loan to Oikonomia in order to make certain down payments to the local developers,35 and committed funds for future payments.36\n\nLetter from L.

See also Memorial, para. 165.\n\n58.\n\nOn 3 December 2009, Oikonomia entered into a series of preliminary share purchase agreements with the local developers who owned the 12 SPVs, and made partial payments pursuant to those agreements with the funds facilitated by ESCO.37\n\nSummary Table of Preliminary Share Purchase Agreements between Oikonomia and the Local Development Companies, 3 December 2009, Exhibit C-59; and Preliminary Share Purchase Agreements between Oikonomia and the Local Development Companies, 3 December 2009, Exhibit C-60, Article 3.01. See also Memorial, para. 166.\n\n59.\n\nFor the development of the project, the Claimants established a corporate structure consisting of a Belgian holding company (Blusun) and two Italian subsidiaries: Societa Interconnessioni Brindisi S.R.L. (SIB) and Eskosol.\n\n60.\n\nBlusun was established by Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein on 10 December 2009 as a holding company. The company was registered in Belgium on 20 December 2009.38 The sole shareholders of Blusun are Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein.39 Mr. Lecorcier holds two-thirds of the shares; Mr. Stein, one third.\n\nBlusun, Certificate of Good Standing (updated), 26 September 2013,4 February 2014, 23 July 2014, Exhibit C-3.\n\nBlusun, Articles of Association (updated), 10 December 2009, 20 December 2009, 11 April 2011, Exhibit C-4, p. 2.\n\n61.\n\nSIB was established by Oikonomia on 14 December 2009, and was registered in Rome on 16 December 2009.40 Oikonomia transferred the full ownership of SIB to Blusun on 18 December 2009. However, after a change in SIB\u2019s corporate structure, Blusun retained 50% of SIB\u2019s shares.41 According to the Claimants, SIB\u2019s primary role was to build and manage the two substations.42\n\nSIB, Certificate of Incorporation *(Visura Camerale),* 18 April 2014, Exhibit C-229, p. 1.\n\nTransfer of the Quotas of SRL between J.-P.

The Italian legislative and regulatory framework for solar projects as of November 2009\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nOne of the main legislative sources at the time the Claimants invested in the solar project in Puglia was Legislative Decree 387/2003, dated 31 January 2004, which implemented European Directive 2001/77/EC of 27 September 2001 on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources in the EU internal electricity market (the ***'****First Renewables Directive').45***\n\n*Decreto Legislative) 29 dicembre 2003, n. 387* (Legislative Decree 29 December 2003, No. 387), Exhibit CL-50.\n\n64.\n\nThe First Renewables Directive was aimed at promoting the development of energy produced from renewable sources. It provided, among other things, that Member States should adopt national indicative targets regarding the consumption of energy produced from renewable sources,46 publish reports regarding the achievement of the national indicative targets every two years,47 and simplify the authorisation procedures for renewable energy projects.48 The European Commission, in turn, would assess the cost-effectiveness of the incentives adopted by the Members States in view of the adoption of a subsequent EU framework on this matter.49\n\nDirective 2001/77/EC, of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Promotion of Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources in the Internal Electricity Market, 2001 O.J. (L 283) 33, 27 September 2001, Exhibit CL-6, Article 3(2).\n\nIbid., Article 3(3).\n\nIbid., Article 6.\n\nIbid., Article 4.\n\n65.\n\nAt the time of the Claimants\u2019 initial involvement in the project, solar projects in Italy were subject to national and regional regulations. The regulations cited by the Parties in this proceeding concern (1) construction permits, (2) permits for connecting the plants to the medium- and high-voltage grids, and (3) tariffs.50 These are briefly described below.\n\nMemorial, paras. 53-119; Counter-Memorial, paras. 44-113.\n\n1. Construction permits\n-----------------------\n\n66.\n\nAt the national level, Legislative Decree 387/2003 established a simplified authorisation procedure for the construction of plants powered by renewable sources, according to which renewable energy projects need to obtain only a single authorisation (called  ***\u2018Antorizzazione Unica\u2019***  or ***\u2018AU\u2019***) granted by a joint conference in which all relevant authorities participate to assess the application.51 The decree required the AU procedure to be completed within 180 days from the filing of the application.52 Moreover, the AU procedure was subject to existing regulations regarding environmental protection.53\n\n*Decrelo Legislative 29 dicembre 2003, n. 387* (Legislative Decree 29 December 2003, No. 387), Exhibit CL-50, Article 12.\n\nIbid., Article 12(4). See also Memorial, para. 58.\n\n*Decreto Legislative) 29 dicembre 2003, n. 387* (Legislative Decree 29 December 2003, No. 387), Exhibit CL-50, Article 12(3).\n\n67.\n\nSolar plants with capacity below 20 KW were subject to a different, declaratory procedure (the  ***\u2018Denuncia di Inizio Attivita\u2019***  or ***\u2018DIA\u2019***). This procedure was established by Decree of the President of the Republic No. 380 of 6 June 2001, which entered into force on 1 January 2002.54 The DIA procedure consisted in the presentation of a declaration and supporting documentation by the applicant. Absent formal objection by the competent authority (i.e. the municipality concerned) within 30 days following the application, the applicant was permitted to begin work.55 The DIA authorisation was thus implicit, and the works had to be completed within three years after the expiration of the 30-day period for objection by the municipal authority.56\n\nIbid., Article 12(5).\n\n*Decreto Presidente della Repubblica 6 giugno 2001, n. 380* (Decree of the President of the Republic of 6 June 2001, No. 380), Exhibit CL-59, Article 23(1). See also Memorial, para. 61 and Counter-Memorial, para. 86.\n\n*Decreto Presidente della Repubblica 6 giugno 2001, n. 380* (Decree of the President of the Republic of 6 June 2001, No. 380), Exhibit CL-59, Article 23(2).\n\n68.\n\nThe Puglia region also adopted laws and regulations regarding the construction of solar plants. These included, in particular, Puglia Regional Law 1/2008 of 19 February 2008, and Puglia Regional Law 31/2008 of 21 October 2008.57 Both regional laws allowed the use of the DIA procedure for solar plants with a capacity up to 1 MW.58 They also contained specific requirements for DIA applicants for solar plants to be built on agricultural land.59 Regional Law 31/2008 added some additional requirements for this kind of project: (a) the plot of land on which the plant was located should be at least twice as large as the portion occupied by the plant; and (b) the portion not occupied by the plant should be used exclusively for agricultural activities.60 Regional Law 31/2008 also provided as follows:\n\nPlants installed on the ground in an agricultural area which consists of lands belonging to the same owner, or which is made up of several plots resulting from the splitting of an area of greater extension carried out within two years prior to the application, are considered as a single plant for the purposes of calculating the maximum electric power for having recourse to the DIA procedure.61\n\n*Legge regionale 19 febbraio 2008, n. 1* (Regional Law of 19 February 2008, No. 1), Exhibit CL-70  ***(\u2018Regional Law 1/2008\u2019);***  and *Legge regionale 21 ottobre 2008, n. 31* (Regional Law of 21 October 2008, No. 31), Exhibit CL-72  ***(\u2018Regional Law 31/2008\u2019).***  See also Memorial, para. 66 and Counter-Memorial, para. 88.\n\nRegional Law 1/2008, Exhibit CL-70, Article 27(1); Regional Law 31/2008, Exhibit CL-72, Article 3(1).\n\nRegional Law 1/2008, Exhibit CL-70, Article 27(2); Regional Law 31/2008, Exhibit CL-72, Article 3.\n\nRegional Law 31/2008, Exhibit CL-72, Article 3(1)(b).\n\nIbid., Article 3(1)(b).\n\n69.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that \u2018the use of the DIA for plants of less than 1 MW was excluded by the mentioned regional laws if the plants established on agricultural land belonged to a single owner, or were part of a unitary project.\u201962 It also claims that, even though Regional Law 1/2008 did not include an express provision to this effect, \u2018this has constantly been interpreted in this way.\u201963\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 90-91.\n\nIbid., para. 92.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent notes that \u2018these principles were reiterated in further measures of the Puglia Region\u2019,64 and inserted in the National Guidelines for the authorisation of plants powered by renewable sources.65\n\nIbid., para. 94. See Regional Government Decree (DGR) no. 3029 of 30 December 2010, Exhibit RL-3, Article 5; and Regional Law 25/2012, Exhibit RL-4, Article 5(10).\n\nDecree 10 September 2010, Guidelines for the authorization of plants powered by renewable sources, OJ 18 September 2010 no. 219, Exhibit RL-1, paragraph 11.6 (as translated at para. 94 of the Counter-Memorial): The limits of generation capacity and power... are to be understood as referred to the sum of nominal power, for each source, of each production plant belonging to the same subject or on which the same subject has the dominant decision position, belonging to the same connection point of the power grid.\n\n71.\n\nThe Parties also refer to Circular 38/8763 of 1 August 2008. By this circular, the Puglia department of economic development recommended that the municipalities pay attention to possible connections between multiple declarations of the initiation of activity, as oversights on the part of the applicants could have led to the use of the DIA procedure for plants whose overall electric power exceeds the 1 MW limit set forth in Article 27 of Regional Law 1/2008.66\n\n*Nota Circolare Regime Puglia 1 agosto 2008, n. 38/8763* (Puglia Circular of 1 August 2008, No. 38/8763), Exhibit CL-74, p. 3. See also Memorial, para. 69; Counter-Memorial, para. 93.\n\n2. Permits to connect to the national transmission and local distribution grids\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe national transmission grid in Italy is operated by Terna S.p.A.  ***(\u2018Terna\u2019).***  Most of the local distribution grids are operated by Enel.67 Connection to the national transmission and local distribution grids is regulated by the Authority for the Electric Energy and Gas (the \u2018A\u00a3\u00a3G\u2019). The Claimants describe the connection procedure by reference to two AEEG Resolutions: AEEG Resolution No. 281/2005 (also called the  ***\u2018GOAL Resolution\u2019,***  which was in force between 22 December 2005 and 31 December 2008) and AEEG Resolution No. 99/2008 (also called the  ***\u2018TICA Resolution\u2019,***  which has been in force since 1 January 2009 to the present).68 Both resolutions addressed interconnections requests for plants of less than 10 MW.69\n\nSimone Monesi, Italy, in The Energy Regulation and Markets Review (David L. Schwartz ed., 2012), Exhibit CL-90, p. 147.\n\nDelibera AEEG 19 dicembre 2005, n. 281, in G.U. 11 gennaio 2006, n. 8, last amended by Delibera AEEG 11 dicembre 2008, n. ARG/elt 179/08, in G.U. 4 febbraio 2009, n. 28. (It.), 19 December 2005, Exhibit CL-60; and Delibera AEEG 23 luglio 2008, n. ARG/elt 99/08, Annex A, Art. 3 (It.), 23 July 2008, Exhibit CL-61.\n\nDelibera AEEG 23 luglio 2008, n. ARG/elt 99/08, Annex A, Art. 3 (It.), 23 July 2008, Exhibit CL-61.\n\n73.\n\nUnder the GOAL Resolution, the applicant was required to submit an application and pay a fee to Enel, which in turn would propose a solution to the applicant in order to connect to the grid: this was called the \u2018general minimum technical solution\u2019  ***(\u2018Soluzione Tecnica Minima Generate\u2019***  or  ***\u2018STMG\u2019).***  The applicant had to accept the STMG within a certain period of time. Following the acceptance of the STMG by the applicant, Enel issued a detailed minimum technical solution  ***(\u2018Soluzione Tecnica Minima di Dettaglio'***  or  ***\u2018STMD\u2019).70***\n\nDelibera AEEG 19 dicembre 2005, n. 281, in G.U. 11 gennaio 2006, n. 8, last amended by Delibera AEEG 11 dicembre 2008, n. ARG/elt 179/08, in G.U. 4 febbraio 2009, Annex A, Art. 10.6 (It.), 19 December 2005, Exhibit CL-60.\n\n74.\n\nUnder the TICA Resolution, a distinction is made between applications to connect to the medium-voltage grid and to the high-voltage grid. Applicants have to submit their requests to the local grid operator and pay a fee. For requests concerning connection of plants of between 100 KW and 1 MW to the medium-voltage grid, Enel issues an interconnection estimate *('preventive di connessione\u2019)* valid for 45 days which the applicant has to accept. The interconnection estimate also indicates the amount to be paid for connection works.

The construction permits\n---------------------------\n\n89.\n\nBetween June 2008 and June 2009, the local development companies applied for DIA authorisations for 119 solar plants pursuant to Puglia\u2019s regional laws No. 1/2008 and 31/2008.102 The Respondent provided a map indicating the location of the plants.103\n\nSummary Table of DIA Authorizations. 2008-2009, Exhibit C-ll; and DIA Applications, with Correspondence, 2008-2009, Exhibit C-12. 83 DIAs were granted under Law 31/2008; the remainder under Law 1/2008.\n\nCadastral Maps of Brindisi Municipality, 17 November 2014, Exhibit R-8; and Cadastral Maps of Mesagne Municipality, 17 November 2014, Exhibit R-9.\n\n90.\n\nThe local development companies obtained 65 certificates of expiry, confirming that the 30-day limit to raise objections had expired,104 and 53 certificates of conformity,105 which stated that the construction of the relevant solar plants was in conformity with the procedures set out in Regional Law 31/2008 and with general urban planning instruments.\n\nDIA Certificates of Expiry, 3 November 2008 - 26 June 2009, Exhibit C-19.\n\nDIA Certificates of Conformity, 5 March 2009 - 21 May 2010, Exhibit C-24.\n\nE. The Constitutional Court decision of 2010 and the regulations adopted thereafter\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nIn December 2008, the Italian Government sought to challenge the constitutionality of Puglia\u2019s Regional Law 31/2008 before the Constitutional Court. One of the main grounds for the constitutional challenge was that, by permitting recourse to DIA authorisations for solar plants with capacity above the threshold set out in Legislative Decree 387/2003 (i.e., 20 KW), Article 3 of Puglia\u2019s Regional Law 31/2008 (which permitted recourse to that procedure for solar plants of up to 1 MW) contradicted Legislative Decree 387/2003.106\n\n*Corte Cost., 26 marzo 2010, n. 119* (Constitutional Court, 26 March 2010, No. 119), Exhibit CL-81, p. 3.\n\n92.\n\nOn 26 March 2010, the Constitutional Court ruled that Article 3, paragraphs 1 and 2, of Puglia\u2019s Regional Law 31/2008 were unconstitutional.107\n\nIbid., p. 12.\n\n93.\n\nOn 13 August 2010, the Italian Government adopted Law 129/2010 (also called the  ***\u2018Salva-Alcoa law\u2019),***  approving Law Decree 105/2010. Law 129/2010 provided as follows:\n\nArticle  *1-quater*  Declarations of initiation of activity regarding the construction of electric power plants based on renewable sources\n\n1. The effects related to the authorization procedures based on [DIAs] referred to in Articles 22 and 23 of the Consolidated Text set by the Decree of the President of the Republic n. 380 of 6 June 2001, for the construction of plants for the production of electricity from renewable sources, initiated in accordance with regional laws, concerning thresholds exceeding the levels set out in Table A of the Legislative Decree n. 387 of 29 December 2003 [i.e., plants with capacity above 20 kilowatts], are maintained, provided that the operation of the plants starts within one-hundred and fifty days from the date of entry into force of the present Law implementing this decree.108\n\n*Legge 13 agosto 2010, n. 129* (Law of 13 August 2010, No. 129), Exhibit CL-67, p. 1.\n\n94.\n\nOn 25 November 2010, Watson Farley, acting as counsel for Eskosol, sought clarification from the GSE as to the effect of Law 129/2010 on the plants that obtained DIA authorisations between August and September 2008 and, in particular, on their eligibility for feed-in tariffs.109 On 3 December 2010, the GSE responded as follows:\n\nIf the plants referred to in the first sentence of paragraph 3 mentioned above, i.e., those authorized between August and September 2008, comply with all the requirements, including with the technical standards resulting from the applicable rules, such as the decisions of the Authority for the Electric Energy and Gas, and unless the competent administrative authorities should rule in a different manner with regard to the interpretation of Article 1-  *quater*  of the Decree Law 105/2010 approved, with its amendments, by Law 129/2010, it is held that admission to the incentives under the so-called Energy Account is possible, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable legislation.110\n\nLetter from Watson Farley to GSE, 25 November 2010, Exhibit C-l40.\n\nLetter from GSE to Watson Farley, 3 December 2010, Exhibit C-145.\n\n95.\n\nOn 15 December 2010, the Ministry of Economic Development issued a Circular regarding the scope of Law 129/2010. The Circular stated as follows:\n\n[T]he provisions of article *1-quater* are not intended in any way to have effects with respect to so-called \u2018consolidated\u2019 legal relationships, *i.e.,* relating to those DIAs that have become \u2018final\u2019 since no longer subject to challenge due to the expiration of time-limits to file an appeal in courts and/or to submit extraordinary appeals to the President of the Republic. These DIAs are therefore not subject to the time-limit for commencement of operations of plants established by article 1*-quater* above.111\n\nAccording to Claimants, it was only the Circular which finally cleared up the uncertainty arising from the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 26 March 2010.\n\n*Circolare Ministeriale 15 dicembre 2010* (Ministerial Circular of 15 December 2010), Exhibit CL-48, p. 2.\n\nF. Eskosol\u2019s EPC contract with Siemens and contacts with potential investors\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nOn 29 December 2010, Eskosol signed an EPC contract with Siemens for the construction of the plants.112 The EPC contract provided that the plants would be built in three phases: 30 MW should be connected by 30 April 2011, an additional 60 MW should be connected by 31 August 2011, and an additional 30 MW should be connected by 15 November 2011.113\n\nTurnkey Contract for the Construction of a Photovoltaic Project of a 120 MW Solar Plant between Eskosol and Siemens, 29 December 2010, Exhibit C-155 (the  ***\u2018EPC contract').***\n\nIbid., Whereas III.\n\n97.\n\nUnder the EPC contract, Eskosol was responsible for: (a) providing the photovoltaic modules,114 (b) purchasing or leasing the land where the plants would be built,115 and (c) obtaining and maintaining the relevant permits and grid connection authorisations.116 Siemens was allowed to propose amendments to the scope of work in case of change in the applicable permits.117 The EPC contract also provided that Siemens would be subject to the payment of liquidated damages in the event that delays in the completion of the works resulted in Eskosol missing the subsidies.118\n\nIbid., Whereas V and Article 2.7.\n\nIbid., Article 2.13(a)(i).\n\nIbid., Article 2.13(vii) and Article 5(a).\n\nIbid., 3.3(a)(iii).\n\nIbid., Article 14.3.\n\n98.\n\nOn 29 December 2010, Eskosol also hired Energy One S.R.L. as director of works and safety management for the construction of the 120 solar plants.119\n\nContract between Eskosol and Energy One, 29 December 2010, Exhibit C-153.\n\n99.\n\nOn 20 January 2011, Eskosol and Siemens agreed to postpone the signature of the annexes to the EPC contract until 28 January 2011, and the date for the first down payment until 28 February 2011.120 On the same date, Eskosol sent a notice to Siemens requesting it to proceed with the works regarding the first group of plants.121\n\nSide Letter to the EPC Contract between Eskosol and Siemens, 20 January 2011, Exhibit C-l 58.\n\nNotice to Proceed from Eskosol to Siemens, 20 January 2011, Exhibit C-157.\n\n100.\n\nOn 26 January 2011 and 4 February 2011, Eskosol received letters from financial investors showing interest in the Project and requesting information.122 No commitments of project financing were, however, obtained at this or any time.\n\nLetter from Vei Capital, Generali Private Equity and UniCredit to HSBC, 26 January 2011, Exhibit C-160; and Letter from Generali Private Equity and UniCredit to Eskosol, 4 February 2011, Exhibit C-161.\n\n101.\n\nOn 28 February 2011, Eskosol failed to make the 20% down payment, and on 7 March 2011 Siemens suspended performance of the EPC contract and proposed conditions for the works to resume.123\n\nMemorial, para. 262; Letter from Siemens to Eskosol, 7 March 2011, Exhibit C-168. Siemens finally terminated the EPC contract on 16 December 2011 (see Exhibit C-207).\n\nG. The Romani Decree\n--------------------\n\n102.\n\nOn 3 March 2011, the Italian Government enacted Legislative Decree 28/2011 (the  ***\u2018Romani Decree'*** ), which entered into force on 29 March 2011.124 The stated objective of the Romani Decree was to implement Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, and to amend and repeal Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC.125\n\nRomani Decree, Exhibit CL-51.\n\nIbid., Article 1.\n\n103.\n\nAmong other reforms, the Romani Decree established that the feed-in tariffs adopted by the Decree of 6 August 2010 (the Third Energy Account) applied only to plants that entered into operation before 31 May 201 1126 (and not, as originally established in the 6 August 2010 Decree, to plants that entered into operation by 31 December 2013).127\n\nIbid., Article 25(9).\n\nThird Energy Account, Exhibit CL-55, Article 8.\n\n104.\n\nThe Romani Decree also established that any solar plants to be built on agricultural land would be eligible for feed-in tariffs only if the plant had a capacity of less than 1 MW and occupied less than 10% of the parcel on which it was erected.128 This limitation, however, did not apply to those plants that entered into operation within one year of the entry into force of the Romani Decree (i.e., by 29 March 2012).129\n\nRomani Decree, Exhibit CL-51, Article 10(4).\n\nIbid., Article 10(6).\n\n105.\n\nAs noted by both Parties, investors in the solar energy industry reacted against the Romani Decree.130 The Respondent notes that some investors sought to challenge it by bringing administrative proceedings. In particular, it cites a decision from a Lazio court which upheld the legality of the Romani Decree on the ground that \u2018it seems rather to implement a \"fine tuning\" oriented to proportionality and gradual[ness], in full compliance with the directions of European law.\u2019131\n\nMemorial, para. 283; Counter-Memorial, paras. 170-171.

BI). As to the new restrictions on agricultural land, the Lazio tribunal held that \u2018the regulatory framework exceeds the evaluation of reasonableness\u2019, in particular because of the transitional periods allowed: ibid., p. 24.\n\nH. The Fourth Energy Account\n----------------------------\n\n106.\n\nOn 19 April 2011, the Italian Government made public a draft decree containing the key components of the Fourth Energy Account.132\n\nMinister of Economic Development, Draft Decree, 19 April 2011, Exhibit C-179.\n\n107.\n\nThe Fourth Energy Account was adopted by Decree of 5 May 2011.133 The Claimants highlight three aspects:\n\n(a) First, for the period between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2012, the Fourth Energy Account limited to specific amounts the incentives available for \u2018large plants.\u2019134\n\n(b) Second, it created an on-line register of plants eligible for feed-in tariffs administered by the GSE.135 Large plants that entered into operation on or before 31 August 2011 were automatically eligible for feed-in tariffs, while those entering into operation between 1 September 2011 and 31 December 2012 had to be listed in the register. Plants listed in the register would receive feed-in tariffs only if the ranking in the register so allowed, based on the costs limits established in Article 4(2).136 The deadline for submitting applications to the GSE register, for purposes of eligibility for feed-in tariffs in 2011, was 30 June 2011.137\n\n(c) Third, the Fourth Energy Account established that, for the purposes of the allocation of feed-in tariffs, \u2018several photovoltaic plants belonging, or attributable to, the same responsible entity and located either within the same or within contiguous cadastral parcels of land shall be considered a single plant of a capacity equal to the cumulative capacity of the individual plants.\u2019138 The plants\u2019 capacity, in turn, had an impact on the amount of the feed-in tariffs.139\n\nFourth Energy Account, Exhibit CL-56.\n\nIbid., Article 4.\n\nIbid., Article 8.\n\nIbid., Article 6.\n\nIbid., Article 8(2).\n\nIbid., Article 12(5). Under Article 3, the term \u2018Responsible Entity\u2019 was defined as \u2018the entity responsible for the functioning and maintenance of the plant, and who has the right to request and obtain the feed-in tariffs, as well as the entity that requires inclusion in the registers referred to in Art. 8.\u2019\n\nIbid., Annex 5.\n\n108.\n\nEskosol submitted all applications for the GSE register by 30 June 2011,140\n\nLecorcier WS1, para. 111; Stein WS1, para. 149.\n\n109.\n\nIn May 2011, Eskosol hired Capital Systeme Investissements S.A.  ***(\u2018Capital Systeme'),***  an investment firm, to prepare a valuation of the Project for presentation to potential investors.

Transcript, Day 5, 87:3-8.\n\nJ. The project to build 27 plants\n---------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nAccording to Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein, in the autumn of 2011, Eskosol was in a difficult financial situation. This led its shareholders to split the Project and build 27 solar plants (instead of 113) by the 29 March 2012 deadline. In their view, the sale of those plants would have allowed them to purge Eskosol\u2019s and SIB\u2019s debt.150\n\nLecorcier WS1, paras. 117 and 119; Stein WS1, paras. 155-156.\n\n114.\n\nOn 7 October 2011, Eskosol received a preliminary non-binding offer from Euro Catalysts Capital, proposing to purchase the 27 plants for approximately \u20ac67 million on the assumption that 11 plants would be connected to the grid by the end of November and that the other 16 would be connected by the end of December 2011.151 After receiving the non-binding offer, Eskosol negotiated a new EPC contract with two local construction companies to construct the 27 solar plants.152 This agreement provided that Eskosol assigned to its creditors the price that would be realized on the sale of the 27 plants to a final taker.153 In exchange, Eskosol\u2019s creditors agreed to waive any claims they had against Eskosol.154 Having reached this agreement with its creditors, Eskosol still \u2018had to convince Euro Catalysts (or other investors) of the feasibility of the 27-plant project, in order to finalize a purchase offer.\u2019155\n\nEuro Catalysts Capital, Term Sheet Non Binding for 100% Equity Investing of 27 MW Ground based PV Project, 7 October 2011, Exhibit C-202, pp. 2 and 3.\n\nEskosol, Debt Restructuring Agreement, 4 November 2011, Exhibit C-203.\n\nIbid., Articles 3 and 6.\n\nIbid., Article 8.\n\nLecorcier WS1, paras. 122 and 123.\n\n115.\n\nAlso in November 2011, Eskosol decided to start the construction of two of the solar plants itself,156 and it obtained a loan for that purpose on 18 November 2011.157\n\nLecorcier WS1, para. 123; Stein WS1, para. 159.\n\nDebenture Loan Agreement between Blusun and Josebe Trust, Undated, Exhibit C-237.\n\nK. The municipal stop-work order\n--------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nOn 17 November 2011, the environmental protection unit of the local police inspected Eskosol\u2019s construction sites. On 21 November 2011, the police communicated observations regarding the inspection to the local prosecutor.158 On 25 November 2011, the local prosecutor informed the municipality of Brindisi that the situation as observed by the police constituted a criminal offense violating zoning regulations.159 In his letter, the prosecutor stated as follows:\n\n[G]iven the contiguity of the planned plants and their connection to a unique centre of interests, it is obvious that the intent of the owners of this business project was to proceed with an artificial division of several plants in order to circumvent the procedure for the issuance of a construction permit by the region.160\n\nOrder of the Carabinieri for the Protection of the Environment, 21 November 2011, Exhibit C-204.\n\nLetter from the Prosecutor\u2019s Office to the Tribunal of Brindisi, 25 November 2011, Exhibit C-206.\n\nIbid., p. 1.\n\n117.\n\nThe prosecutor referred to Puglia\u2019s Circular of 1 August 2008 and stated that it:\n\ninvited the Municipalities to adopt an attentive surveillance in order to prevent the occurrence of this fraudulent division of a single plant into several plants having an electrical power inferior to 1 MW. In light of the above, I wonder what actions will be undertaken to revoke the DIAs.161\n\nIn fact, the Circular of 1 August 2008 provided as follows:\n\nIn consideration of the aforementioned circumstances, related to the presence of a large number of DIA procedures before the Municipal Authorities, it is recommended to the same to pay the maximum attention to possible connections between multiple *declarations of the initiation of activity.* Application negligence on the part of the applicants, when it is not their unlawful behaviour, could support the application to DIA even in the case of plants whose nominal overall electric power transcend the limits set by article 27 of regional Law n. 1/2008.\n\n...\n\nTherefore, it appears appropriate that the Municipal Authorities pay the maximum attention in verifying the existence of such situations, which for example may be inferred from the significant recurrence of symptomatic elements, such as a single point of connection, the uniqueness of the owner of the areas, the uniqueness of the industrial initiative (derived from the uniqueness of the applicants, or business contacts), and any other useful factual circumstance to be gathered by means of inquiry.162\n\nIbid., p. 1.\n\n*Nota Circolare Regione Puglia 1 agosto 2008, n. 38/8763* (Puglia Circular of 1 August 2008, No. 38/8763), Exhibit CL-74, p. 3 (emphasis in the original).\n\n118.\n\nOn 19 December 2011, the municipality of Brindisi launched self-redress proceedings in order to review the DIA authorisations held by three of the 12 local development companies.163\n\nLetter from Municipality of Brindisi to Gamma Service, Aurora Energia, Dada Project and Eskosol, 19 December 2011, Exhibit C-208.\n\n119.\n\nOn 11 January 2012, the municipality of Brindisi issued a stop-work order preventing any further work on plants in the project under construction.164 However, on 13 January 2012, the Regional Administrative Court decided to suspend the effects of the stop-work order issued by the municipality of Brindisi,165 and on 7 March 2012, the Regional Administrative Court annulled for excess of power the decisions of the municipality of Brindisi to initiate self-redress proceedings and to issue a stop-work order. According to the Claimants, this was a Pyrrhic victory, because there was not enough time to build the Project\u2019s plants between the decision of the Administrative Court of 7 March 2012 and the expiration of the 29 March 2012 deadline imposed by the Romani Decree.166 The Regional Administrative Court\u2019s decision is discussed in paragraph 356 below: it drew a distinction between \u2018the conditions stated at the time of the submission of the application or... the previous two years\u2019 and \u2018the need for the requirement to subsist afterwards\u2019 - in effect a distinction between fractionation of holdings at the time of lodging the DIA (prohibited) and subsequent amalgamation of holdings once the DIA procedure was complete (permitted).167\n\nMunicipality of Brindisi, \u2018Decision of suspension of the activity undertaken as a result of the declaration of the initiation of activity (DIA), Prot.

Law Decree 1 of 24 January 2012\n----------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThis Law Decree provided that, as from 24 January 2012 (its date of entry into force), solar plants built on agricultural land would no longer benefit from the incentives set out in the Romani Decree. It also provided, however, that plants built on agricultural land could still be eligible if:\n\n(a) a construction permit was issued before 24 January 2012;\n\n(b) the plant started operating by 23 January 2013; and\n\n(c) the plant complied with the conditions set forth in Article 10(4) and (5) of the Romani Decree (i.e., if they had capacity below 1 MW and occupied less than 10% of the agricultural land on which they were built, and, for plants belonging to the same owner, if they were located at least 2 km away from each other).168\n\n*Decreto Legge 24 gennaio 2012, n. 1* (Law Decree 24 January 2012, No. 1) Exhibit CL-52, Article 65(2).\n\n121.\n\nThe other exception foreseen by Law Decree 1 concerned solar plants installed on top of greenhouses, provided that they occupied less than 50% of the total surface of the rooftop.169\n\nIbid., Article 65(3).\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimants contend that their plants could not comply with this regulation because they were all built on agricultural land. Nor did they fall within the exception, as they occupied more than 10% of the land on which they would be built.170\n\nMemorial, para. 345.\n\n123.\n\nLaw Decree 1 was subsequently ratified by Law 27 of 24 March 2012, which introduced some changes to Article 65 of Law Decree 1 (\u2018Photovoltaic plants built on agricultural land\u2019).171\n\n*Legge 24 marzo 2012, n.* 27 (Law of 24 March 2012, No. 27), Exhibit CL-68  ***('Law 27/2012').***  Law 27/2012 reads in relevant part as follows: Article 65 is replaced as follows: Art. 65 (Photovoltaic plants built on agricultural land). - 1. The solar photovoltaic plants with ground-built modules on agricultural land shall not have access to the state incentives set forth in Legislative Decree 3 March 2011, n. 28. 2. Paragraph 1 does not apply to plants built or to be built on military land and to solar photovoltaic plants with ground-built modules to be constructed on lands classified as agricultural at the effective date of conversion into law of the present decree, provided, in any case, that the plants become operational within one hundred and eighty days from the effective date of conversion into law of the present decree. The said plants shall in any event be in compliance with the conditions set forth in paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 10 of legislative decree 3 March 2011, n. 28. Furthermore, paragraph 6 of article 10 of legislative decree 3 March 2011, n. 28, shall also apply, provided that the plant becomes operational within sixty days from the effective date of conversion into law of the present decree. 3. The Authority for the Energy and the Gas shall ensure, in compliance with ELF law, the grid connection priority for a single plant producing electricity from renewable sources not exceeding 200kW for each agricultural business. 4. Paragraphs 4 and 5 of article 10 of Legislative Decree 3 March 2011, n.28, are repealed, subject to what is provided in paragraph 2. 5. Paragraph 4-bis of article 12 of Legislative Decree 29 December 2003, n. 387, introduced by article 27, paragraph 42, of law 23 July 2009, n. 99, shall only refer to the construction of plants fuelled by biomass located in areas classified as agricultural by the urban planning regulations.\n\nM. Abandonment of the Project by the Claimants\n----------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nOn 5 July 2012, the Italian government adopted the Fifth Energy Account.172 Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein explored the possibility of transforming the 120-MW Project into a series of single activities in order to benefit from the feed-in tariffs under the Fifth Energy Account. They also tried to sell the two substations. But they eventually decided to abandon the Project. Their decision was recorded in a resolution of SIB\u2019s shareholders at a meeting on 18 December 2012.173\n\nFifth Energy Account, Exhibit CL-57.\n\nNotarized Minutes of Meeting of SIB, 18 December 2012, Exhibit C-220.\n\nV. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES ON JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. The Respondent\u2019s position\n----------------------------\n\n125.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent raised an objection to the competence of the Tribunal and the jurisdiction of the Centre on two grounds. First, the Project did not qualify as an investment for purposes of the ICSID Convention or the ECT and instead the Claimants\u2019 activities qualified only as pre-investment expenditures of a speculative character.174 Second, the Project was not a protected investment under the ECT because it was constituted in violation of Italian law and the principle of good faith.175\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 274; see also paras. 280-305.\n\nIbid., paras. 275, 277; see also paras. 306-349.\n\n126.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that to the extent the Tribunal upholds its jurisdiction, it should consider the Claimants\u2019 claims inadmissible on the ground of unclean hands.176\n\nIbid., para. 276.\n\n127.\n\nIt is to be noted that neither in its Counter-Memorial nor in its Reply did Italy raise any objection based on the law of the European Union or the suggested inapplicability of the ECT in intra-EU disputes. Those issues arose only following the EU\u2019s request to file a non-disputing party brief, and they are dealt with below in that context (see paragraphs 206-260 and 277-309).\n\n1. The Project was not an investment under the ICSID Convention and the ECT\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) The ICSID Convention\n------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent refers to the *Salini test,* as the \u2018most widely invoked\u2019 criterion to determine whether there is an investment for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.177 According to the Respondent, the debate as to whether such test should include the original four elements (i.e. a contribution of money or goods, of certain duration, an element of risk and a contribution to the economic development of the State) or whether it has now evolved to only three (contribution, duration and risk), is immaterial for present purposes. The Respondent posits that under both tests, an investment shall be assessed \u2018within the context and according to the purposes that the [host State] has set for the specific economic activity\u2019 and by respecting the spirit and text of its legislation.178\n\nIbid., para. 281.\n\nIbid., para. 283, citing *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award, 13 April 2009, Exhibit RL-13  ***(Phoenix v. Czech Republic).***\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent contends that to determine if there is an investment past cases have consistently considered that \u2018the presence of an economic activity... in the territory of the host State shall be evaluated in the concrete case and in light of the specific context.\u2019179\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 284.\n\n130.\n\nAgainst this background, the Respondent argues that the Claimants\u2019 operations cannot be considered an investment because they were not carried out for purposes of building a PV plant benefiting from certain regulatory incentives.180 Instead, in the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimants\u2019 activities \u2018were carried out with the intent to sell the rights acquired to third parties to realize the investment.\u2019181 In particular, it argues that the Claimants attempted to make a \u2018financial transaction\u2019 based on the sale of acquired rights, \u2018in a sort of \"secondary market.\u2019\"182 According to the Respondent, the Claimants alleged \u2018investment\u2019 was speculative in character.183\n\nIbid., paras. 285, 288.\n\nIbid., para. 285. See also, paras. 286, 289.\n\nIbid., para. 287.\n\nIbid., para. 288.\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the activities and operations carried out by the Claimants shall be characterized as part of a \u2018pre-investment\u2019 phase.184 It alleges that for an investment to be considered as such within the framework of the PV industry incentives, the plants must be built (executed) and the Claimants must have submitted an actual application for such incentives.185 However, in this case - the Respondent asserts - the Project never reached the execution phase and the incentives were considered part of the \u2018hypothetical profitability parameters.\u2019186 Therefore, there is no investment under the ICSID Convention.\n\nIbid., paras. 291-296.\n\nIbid., para. 292.\n\nIbid., para. 294. The Respondent relies on *Mihaly Int. Corp.* v. *Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/2, Award, 15 March 2002, Exhibit RL-15, paras. 50-51  ***(Mihaly v. Sri Lanka).***\n\n(b)  The ECT\n------------\n\n132.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the ECT does not protect any and all investments, but only those associated \u2018with economic activity in the energy sector\u2019 in accordance with Article 1(6). In particular, the Respondent argues that:\n\n[a]ccording to the ECT, the investment [must] therefore satisfy two distinct criteria: it shall be an investment according to the common use of the term (and for this the non-exhaustive list applies as indicated in article 1(6), letters (a) to (b)), and it shall be functional to the carrying out of activities in the energy sector as listed. The genesis of the standard supports such reading.187\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 301. See also footnote 77, referring to the ECT versions of 31 October 1991 and 20 January 1992.\n\n133.\n\nIn the present context, the Respondent alleges that the ECT protects \u2018investments actually intended for the construction of photovoltaic plants.\u2019188 It considers that the ECT protects those investments that \u2018fit directly into the mechanism of production of energy of the host country... immediately contributing... to the increase of plants of alternative sources in the country.\u2019189\n\nIbid., para. 303.\n\nIbid., para. 303.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the ECT distinguishes between the preinvestment and the investment phase, and explicitly provides guarantees to investors only for the latter phase.190 It concludes that the Project does not fall under the definition of investment under either the ICSID Convention or the ECT.\n\nIbid., para. 304.\n\n2. The Project is not a protected investment under the ECT\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that the ECT does not contain a clause specifying that investments shall be made in accordance with the rules of the host state.191 But relying on the *Yukos, Phoenix* and  **Homester**  decisions, it submits that even without such a clause, the protection of investments under investment treaties, including the ECT, is subject to the legality of the investment itself and the good faith of the investor.192\n\nIbid., para. 310.\n\nIbid., paras. 311-315 (quoting *Yukos Universal Limited (Isle of Man) and The Russian Federation,* PCA Case No. AA 227, Final Award, 18 July 2014, Exhibit CL-22, paras. 1349, 1351-1352  ***(Yukos v.

Ghana);***   *Phoenix* v. *Czech Republic,* Exhibit RL-13, para. 106.\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the alleged investment has been made in violation of Italian law, both national and regional, and that it was made \u2018in the knowledge of circumventing these rules.\u2019193 In particular, it argues that the Claimants violated Italian law by artificially splitting the project, interposing 12 SPVs controlled by the same people when having in mind one single project, and presenting one DIA for each plant of less than 1 MW, despite some of the lands on which the plants were built being contiguous.194 In doing so, the Claimants violated the Single Authorisation procedure and circumvented the applicable rules of environmental protection for plants greater than 1 MW.195\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 316.\n\nIbid., paras. 316,328.\n\nIbid., para. 316.\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent further considers that the Claimants \u2018distorted the *ratio* of the instrument of the DIA\u2019 by not having the financial or other capacity to immediately execute all the necessary work.196\n\nIbid., para. 317.\n\n138.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent asserts that, even if one were to allege that the violations were committed by the local developers, since they originally filed the DIAs, the Claimants were fully aware of them.197 They contend, *inter alia,* that the Claimants had full knowledge of the illegal acts and misrepresentations and that they should have notified the public administration.198 Moreover, relying on the *Yukos* decision, the Respondent argues that, irrespective of who committed the illegal act, the alleged investment itself would be affected by the unlawfulness of the procedures followed to request the authorisations.199\n\nIbid., paras. 318-321.\n\nIbid., paras. 318-321,329.\n\nIbid., paras. 322-325.\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent further alleges that even if the Claimants themselves did not commit the above mentioned violations, it remains that they acted in bad faith when the 12 SPVs were acquired by Eskosol and all the DIAs were transferred *en bloc* to a single project owner.200 According to the Respondent, the Claimants had full knowledge that this was an obvious violation of the law because the issue had been highlighted in the preliminary due diligence report that Watson, Farley and Williams submitted to the Claimants in January 2009.201\n\nIbid., paras. 326-330.\n\nIbid., para. 331, citing Memorial, Exhibit C-83.\n\n140.\n\nRelying on the  **Phoenix**  and *Inceysa* decisions, the Respondent asserts that the principle of good faith is recognized under both national and international law.202 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the Claimants infringed the principle of good faith under international investment law by evading their obligation to request an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in violation of Italian law, Article 19 of the ECT and general principles of international law.203\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 332-335, quoting *Phoenix v. Czech Republic,* Exhibit RL-13, paras. 106-107 and *Inceysa Vallisoletana S.L.* v. *Republic of El Salvador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/26, Award, 2 August 2006, Exhibit RL-17, paras. 243, 249  ***(Inceysa***  **v.**  ***El Salvador).***\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 336-340.\n\n141.\n\nFinally, the Respondent contends that there has never been acquiescence on the part of the Italian administration, nor would the administration\u2019s acceptance be a relevant defence against the Claimants\u2019 bad faith.204\n\nIbid., paras. 345-349.\n\n3. Admissibility\n----------------\n\n142.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the arguments summarized in the preceding paragraphs also support its admissibility objection.205\n\nIbid., paras. 350-355.\n\nB. The Claimants\u2019 position\n--------------------------\n\n143.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent has failed to adduce any proof in support of its objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction *ratione inateriae* and contends that Italy has lignore[d] evidence directly contradicting its position.\u2019206 According to the Claimants, it is undisputable that there is an investment in this case. The investment consists of some \u20ac40 million invested by Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein, the two substations that Blusun\u2019s subsidiaries erected and connected to the national grid, the 250 km of underground cables installed, the direct acquisition of local companies and lands and the indirect holding of project authorisations and permits, as well as related contractual rights.207\n\nReply, para. 43.\n\nIbid., para. 45.\n\n144.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that the record shows no bad faith or illegality, but rather an investment that was made by \u2018conscientious investors concerned with making a positive impact on the local community.\u2019208\n\nIbid., para. 46.\n\n145.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants reject the Respondent\u2019s unclean hands arguments, alleging that they are meritless in fact and law. They argue that the unclean hands doctrine is neither a rule of customary international law nor a general principle of law, that there is no express reference to it in the ECT, and that, even if it is applicable in law, there is no evidence of it in the record.209\n\nIbid., para. 47.\n\n1. The Claimants\u2019 investments under the ECT and the ICSID Convention\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a)  The ECT\n------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Messrs. Lecorcier and Stein indirectly owned and controlled numerous investments within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT in Italy. These include a controlling stake in Eskosol, 12 local development companies, loans, parcels of land, two substations and rings, authorisations and permits, construction and supply contracts, and the amounts derived from or associated with these investments.210\n\nIbid., para. 52.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that the definition of \u2018Economic Activity in the Energy Sector\u2019 provided by the ECT is not limited to industrial activities, and that their investments fall within that definition.211 They assert that, in any event, their investment was a Project \u2018of an industrial scale in a classic industry: the production of electricity\u2019,212 and the fact that the Project was not completed due to Italy\u2019s wrongful acts does not deprive the investments of protection under the ECT.213\n\nIbid., paras. 55-58.\n\nIbid., para. 59.\n\nIbid., para. 60.\n\n(b) The ICSID Convention\n------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Claimants \u2018do not accept that  ***Salini***  defines the term \"investment\" where the \"consent of the parties\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention defines the term for purposes of the dispute, as the ECT does here.\u2019214 In any event, the Claimants contend that their investment meets the  ***Salini***  criteria.215\n\nIbid., para. 64.\n\nIbid., para. 64.\n\n149.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that the Project is not less protected because it was to be substantially financed. They assert that \u2018ICSID tribunals have recognized that \"it is entirely normal for investment projects to be financed by borrowed funds\u2019\",216 and that it is not uncommon for investors to finance construction in whole or in part through loans from investors.217 The Claimants assert that the record shows that they developed the Project and realized a significant part of it.218\n\nIbid., para. 66. See also *Sistem Miihendislik Inyaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.\u00a7.* v. *Kyrgyz. Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/l, Award, 9 September 2009, Exhibit CL-134, para. 35.\n\nReply, para. 67.\n\nIbid., paras. 69-71.\n\n150.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that the Project was not \u2018speculative.\u2019 In their view, the Respondent\u2019s position is wrong as a matter of fact and as a matter of law. The Project \u2018was based on facts, scientifically ascertainable and verifiable.\u2019219 Also, the Claimants say that, by arguing that speculative investments should not be protected under the ICSID Convention, the Respondent would be asking the Tribunal to adopt a novel approach to the  ***Salini***  test, which includes the element of risk.220\n\nIbid., para. 76.\n\nIbid., paras. 78-79.\n\n151.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that their investments were \u2018established\u2019, as they accomplished all of the main Project milestones but for the last one.221 In their view, \u2018the fact that the Claimants\u2019 project never reached the exploitation phase offers no valid jurisdictional objection or defense to Italy.\u2019222 In making this assertion, the Claimants rely on the decisions rendered in *Gold Reserve* and *PSEG.223*\n\nIbid., para. 82.\n\nIbid., para. 83.\n\nIbid., para. 84. See also *Gold Reserve Inc.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/l, Award, 22 September 2014, Exhibit CL-113, paras. 570, 590-591  ***(Gold Reserve v. Venezuela)',***   *PSEG Global Inc. v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5, Award, 19 January 2007, Exhibit CL-125, para. 304  ***(PSEG v. Turkey).***\n\n2. Good faith and the Claimants\u2019 investments\n--------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the authorities relied upon by the Respondent are inapposite. The decisions in  **Phoenix**  and  **Homester**  addressed the alleged general principle that investments should not violate good faith and the host State laws only *obiter.224* In *Homester,* the tribunal did not find that the investment had been obtained by fraud. As to *Phoenix,* the tribunal was concerned with \u2018the international principle of good faith as applied to the international arbitration mechanism of ICSID.\u2019225 In *Inceysa,* in turn, \u2018there was... \"clear and obvious\" evidence that the investor had acted fraudulently in order to be awarded the bid and make the investment.\u2019226\n\nReply, para. 91.\n\nIbid., paras. 93-94, citing*Phoenix* v. *Czech Republic,* paras. 142-144.\n\nReply, para. 97. See also *Inceysa* v. *El Salvador,* paras. 109-122.\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimants also note that there is no evidence in the record showing that they artificially split the Project. In their view, they did not divide the Project but rather united 120 small solar plants initiated by a dozen local development companies.227 The Claimants also contend that the DIA authorisations were obtained in accordance with Italian law, something that was confirmed by the Watson Farley due diligence report and by the Administrative Court in Lecce in March 2012.228 The Claimants note, in particular, that under Italian law, works had to be completed before the expiry of the DIA authorisations - not immediately - and that works had to start within one year, which is what the Claimants did.229 The Claimants also deny that they failed to comply with the timetable of work, or that they breached the disclosure obligation.230\n\nReply, para. 100.\n\nIbid., paras. 103-109.\n\nIbid., para. 104.\n\nIbid., paras. 105-106, 110.\n\n154.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Italian authorities were fully aware of the 120 MW Project and authorized it. They also authorized the construction of the two substations and the rings, and those authorisations were made public.231\n\nIbid., paras. 112-119.\n\n155.\n\nWith respect to the alleged violation of environmental provisions, the Claimants\u2019 arguments are threefold: (a) the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction over an alleged violation of Article 19 of the ECT because it does not fall under Part III of the ECT; (b) neither the ECT nor other sources establish that environmental impact assessment is a requirement of general international law; and (c) the Claimants were not required to obtain an environmental impact assessment, since only plants with capacity above 1 MW are subject to a screening process and may be required to file one.232\n\nIbid., paras. 122-129.\n\n3. The clean hands doctrine\n---------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the ECT does not contain any express clean hands requirement, and the *Yukos* decision does not support the Respondent\u2019s \u2018clean hands\u2019 objection because the tribunal found that the investors there had clean hands.233 Moreover, the Claimants assert that \u2018clean hands\u2019 is neither a rule of customary international law nor a general principle of law.234 They finally argue that their hands are clean, as there was no illegality in the acquisition of the 12 local development companies, and there is no evidence of illegality either before or since those acquisitions.235\n\nIbid., paras. 136-139.\n\nIbid., paras. 140-145.\n\nIbid., paras. 147-159.\n\nVI. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES ON LIABILITY\n-----------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nThe Parties\u2019 arguments on the merits concern the issue of whether the measures adopted by Italy constitute a breach of the standard of treatment provided for in Article 10(1) of the ECT (requiring \u2018stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors\u2019) or a breach of the expropriation provision in Article 13(1) of the ECT.\n\nA. The Claimants\u2019 position\n--------------------------\n\n1. The alleged breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Italy breached Article 10(1) of the ECT in two respects. They claim that: (a) Italy failed to create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions in the energy sector in Italy; and (b) Italy frustrated the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.236 The Claimants rely on the *Plama* award to assert that these standards can be defined autonomously,237 and they contend that the reference in the first sentence of Article 10(1) to promoting \u2018stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions\u2019 creates binding obligations.238\n\nMemorial, para. 411.\n\nIbid., paras. 414-415, citing *Plama Consortium Ltd, v. Republic of Bulgaria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008  ***(Plama v. Bulgaria),***  Exhibit CL-20, para. 161.\n\nReply, paras. 162-172.\n\n(a) Italy\u2019s alleged failure to encourage and create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n159.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT must be interpreted according to Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, that is, in good faith, in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.239 They argue that the words \u2018encourage\u2019 and \u2018create\u2019 imply both an obligation of means and an obligation of result.240\n\nMemorial, para. 417.\n\nIbid., para. 418.\n\n160.\n\nIn particular, the Claimants argue that this obligation must be interpreted in the light of the ECT\u2019s object and purpose of \u2018promoting best possible access to capital\u2019, \u2018formulation of stable and transparent legal frameworks creating conditions for the development of energy resources\u2019, and promoting \u2018use of new and renewable energies and clean technologies.\u2019241\n\nIbid., paras. 426-427; Reply, para. 171.\n\n161.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that the obligation established in the first sentence of Article 10(1) applies to all stages of the investment.242 It also contends that, even on Italy\u2019s own case, it would apply to the Claimants\u2019 activities as pre-investment matters.243\n\nReply, paras. 176-198. See *Plama* v. *Bulgaria,* Exhibit CL-20, para. 172.\n\nReply, paras. 199-201.\n\n162.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, the measures adopted by Italy cannot be reconciled with the conditions that Italy \u2018was obligated to encourage and create under Article 10(1).244 The Claimants assert that the events should be considered in the aggregate rather than as isolated acts.245 They complain specifically about the following measures, which, in their view, \u2018followed one another in a relatively short timeframe and deeply destabilized the Italian solar market\u2019:246\n\n(a) the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of March 2010, which failed to specify its effects on pre-existing authorisations. In the Claimants\u2019 view, this decision had a negative effect on potential debt and/or equity investors,247 as it showed uncertainty as to the decision\u2019s impact on DIA authorisations.248 They contend that if the decision had been clear, there would have been no need for the adoption of Law 129/2010, and that the GSE\u2019s response to Watson Farley\u2019s request was not clear, so the uncertainty remained until December 2010;249\n\n(b) the Romani Decree, which in the Claimants\u2019 view constituted \u2018a sudden and important change in approach for solar projects in development.\u2019250 The Claimants complain about the changes operated by the Romani Decree with respect to the Third Energy Account. They also allege that the Romani Decree signaled that a new and different energy account would soon come into existence, and that therefore no investor was willing to commit funding until the applicable tariffs were published;251\n\n(c) the Fourth Energy Account, which in the Claimants\u2019 view was implemented in a way that prolonged uncertainty due to the publication of several lists, and which disrupted its negotiations with potential investors;252 and\n\n(d) the inspections that started in November 2011 and led to the stop-work order of 11 January 2012.253\n\nMemorial, para. 428.\n\nReply, paras. 225-228.\n\nIbid., para. 231.\n\nMemorial, paras. 429-430; Reply, para. 205.\n\nReply, para. 233.\n\nIbid., para. 237.\n\nMemorial, para. 431; Reply, paras. 205 and 242.\n\nMemorial, paras. 431-432; Reply, paras. 205 and 244.\n\nMemorial, paras. 433-434; Reply, paras. 205 and 252-253.\n\nMemorial, para. 436; Reply, paras. 205 and 308-319.\n\n(b) Italy\u2019s alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Claimants contend that \u2018the most important function of the fair and equitable treatment standard is the protection of the investor\u2019s reasonable and legitimate expectations.\u2019254 They argue that legitimate expectations are established where the following requirements are met: (a) the authorities of the host State made explicit or implicit representations; (b) such representations were relied upon by the investor in making the investment; and (c) the investor\u2019s expectations were legitimate and reasonable in the circumstances of the case.255 The Claimants argue that these requirements are met in the present case.\n\nMemorial, para. 439.\n\nIbid., paras. 440-444; Reply, para. 302. The Claimants rely on a number of authorities, including *Plama v. Bulgaria,* Exhibit CL-20, paras. 176-177; *Electrabel S.A. v. Republic of Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/19, Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability, 30 November 2012, Exhibit CL-10, paras. 7.74-7.75  ***(Electrabel v. Hungary)-,***   *Saluka Investments BV* v. *Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 17 March 2006, Exhibit CL-39, para. 301  ***(Saluka v. Czech Republic)-,***   *AES Summit Generation Ltd. v.

Republic of Tajikistan,* SCC Case No. V (064/2008), Partial Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 2 September 2009, Exhibit CL-16, para. 200; and *Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v. Republic of Georgia,* ICSID Case Nos. ARB/05/18 and ARB/07/15, Award, 3 March 2010, Exhibit CL-13, para. 441.\n\n164.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that stability and transparency are essential elements of the fair and equitable treatment standard.256\n\nReply, para. 221.\n\n165.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Italian Government made multiple representations \u2018that the construction of specific plants was \"in accordance with the procedures set out in Regional Law n. 31/2008 and with general urban planning instruments.\u2019\"257 They also argue that for at least two years after having granted the DIA authorisations, the municipality \u2018took no step to suggest that it had any doubt about the validity of the authorisations it had granted.\u2019258 This, in the Claimants\u2019 view, amounted to an implicit representation that gave rise to legitimate expectations.259 The Claimants further contend that Italy represented, in the Second Energy Account, that it would gradually change the level of feed-in tariffs every two years.260\n\nMemorial, para. 446. See also DIA Certificates of Conformity, 5 March 2009 - 21 May 2010, Exhibit C-24; and DIA Certificates of Expiry, 3 November 2008-26 June 2009, Exhibit C-19.\n\nMemorial, para. 447.\n\nIbid., para. 447.\n\nIbid., para. 448. See also Second Energy Account, Exhibit CL-54; Third Energy Account, Exhibit CL-55, Article 8.\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimants assert that they relied on these representations, as they \u2018committed the bulk of their funds only after Watson Farley had conducted a due diligence review of the authorizations for the plants.\u2019261\n\nMemorial, para. 449. See also Watson Farley, Preliminary Due Diligence Report relating to 123 MW Puglia Project, 22 January 2010, Exhibit C-83.\n\n167.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, their expectations were reasonable under the circumstances. They contend that Italy adopted measures that contradicted the representations it had made and frustrated their investments. In particular, the Claimants assert that the stop-work order \u2018was contrary to the very regional law with which [the municipality of Brindisi] had previously certified [the construction of the solar plant\u2019s] compliance.\u2019262 The Claimants also argue that by the time the order was annulled by the Regional Administrative Court, \u2018no part of the project could be completed before the deadline imposed by the Romani Decree of 29 March 2012.\u2019263\n\nMemorial, para. 451.\n\nIbid., para. 452.\n\n168.\n\nThe Claimants also contend that the Romani Decree breached their legitimate expectations by putting a sudden and premature end to the Third Energy Account, which was to apply until 31 December 2013.264 In the Claimants\u2019 view, the Romani Decree prevented them from securing the additional investment needed.265\n\nIbid., para. 453.\n\nIbid., para. 453.\n\n2. The alleged breach of Article 13 of the ECT\n----------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThe Claimants stress that Article 13(1) of the ECT covers both direct and indirect forms of expropriation, and they assert that their investments were subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation within the meaning of Article 13(1).266 They argue that \u2018[f]or purposes of indirect expropriation, what needs to be taken into account is the effect of the measure\u2019 on the investor\u2019s property.267 In their view, it is not necessary to prove that the measure tantamount to expropriation is to the obvious benefit of the host State, as long as it has \u2018the effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property.\u2019268\n\nIbid., paras. 457 and 463.\n\nIbid., paras. 458-459. See also Jan Paulsson and Zachary Douglas, \u2018Indirect Expropriation in Investment Treaty Arbitration\u2019, in Arbitrating Foreign Investment Disputes 145 (Norbert Horn and Stefan Michael Kroll eds., 2004), Exhibit CL-87. p. 148.\n\nMemorial, para. 460, quoting from *Metalclad Corp. v. United Mexican States,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l, Award, 30 August 2000, Exhibit CL-32, para. 103. See also Memorial, para. 462.\n\n170.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the investments they made were acquired for purposes of the 120 MW Project. They argue that, as a result of the measures adopted by Italy, the land can no longer be used for that purpose, the underground cables connect nothing, the substations are disconnected and serve no purpose, the authorisations are now invalid or useless, and there is no other possible economic use for these assets.269 The Claimants note that Eskosol is now the subject of a bankruptcy order and that SIB and the local development companies are in liquidation.270 In the Claimants\u2019 view, the effect of these measures is \u2018indistinguishable from that of nationalization or expropriation without compensation.\u2019271\n\nMemorial, paras. 464-465.\n\nIbid., para. 466.\n\nIbid., para. 467.\n\nB. The Respondent\u2019s position\n----------------------------\n\n1. The alleged breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Italy\u2019s alleged failure to encourage and create stable, equitable, favorable and transparent conditions\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT \u2018shall be construed... as having the nature of a framework regulation, as such referable only to relations between Contracting States and not directly enforceable by investors.\u2019272 Italy argues that the vagueness of the words \u2018encourage\u2019, \u2018equitable\u2019 and \u2018favourable\u2019 raises doubt on the existence of a specific obligation enforceable by the investor.273\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 365. See also para. 372; Rejoinder, para. 87.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 89-90.\n\n172.\n\nItaly further contends that the use of the phrase \u2018to make investments\u2019 qualifies and limits the scope of application of the regulation, which would be actually aimed at *attracting investment274* As such, the obligation would be placed \u2018in a phase preceding the beginning of the foreign investment itself, thus before the same right to act arises for the investor.\u2019275 In Italy\u2019s view, its position would be confirmed by the definition contained in Article 1(8) of the ECT, which provides that \"\u2018Make Investments\" or \"Making of Investments\" means establishing new Investments, acquiring all or part of existing Investments or moving into different fields of Investment activity.\u2019276\n\nIbid., para. 95.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 368; Rejoinder, para. 95.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 367-369. Analyzing this provision in its context, the Respondent further argues that \u2018[i]f it is true that the second sentence [of Article 10(1)] is strictly related to the first, this does not prevent the second sentence from having a different normative force, that is being specifically binding and directly enforceable by the investor.\u2019 (para. 375). Rejoinder, para. 96.\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent thus rejects all of the arguments made by the Claimants as to the alleged violation of the first sentence of Article 10(1).277\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 379-381; Rejoinder, para. 97.\n\n(b) Italy\u2019s alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s main argument on the merits is that there is no causal link between the State\u2019s conduct and the failure of the Claimants\u2019 business initiative, and that therefore any further analysis in terms of legitimate expectations and fair and equitable treatment is \u2018superfluous.\u2019278 The Respondent also argues that the expectations alleged by the Claimants are not legitimate and that the regulations adopted by the State were reasonable.279\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 384; Rejoinder, paras. 132-133.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 440 *et seq.-,* Rejoinder, paras. 191,202.\n\n(i) The absence of a link between the State\u2019s conduct and the failure of the Project\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Respondent asserts that demonstrating regulatory uncertainty is not enough to prove the existence of that link. In its view, the Claimants would need to show that the alleged regulatory uncertainty is \u2018indeed likely to discourage investors\u2019, and that the State\u2019s conduct had a concrete negative impact on the participation of third-party investors.280\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 391-392; Rejoinder, paras. 174-175.\n\n176.\n\nWith respect to the Constitutional Court\u2019s 26 March 2010 decision, the Respondent notes that it \u2018did not manifest itself suddenly.\u2019281 It contends that the alleged situation of legal uncertainty \u2018should be referred to the date on which the law was challenged.\u2019282 That date is December 2008, and not 2009 as indicated by the Claimants in the Memorial.283 The Respondent thus asserts that \u2018it is not logically possible to argue that third-party investors in 2010 were discouraged by an alleged uncertainty that dated back to the end of 2008.284 Furthermore, the Respondent explains that, under Italian law, the declaration of unconstitutionality of a law cannot affect acquired rights, so \u2018it cannot even be affirmed that after the decision there was a situation of uncertainty regarding these DIAs.\u2019285\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 396.\n\nIbid., para. 397.\n\nIbid., para. 397.\n\nIbid., para. 397; Rejoinder, paras. 177-178.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 399-400.\n\n177.\n\nRegarding the alleged uncertainty created by the adoption of the Romani Decree, the Respondent asserts that the Third Energy Account already provided that the objective of cumulative nominal power from solar energy in Italy by 2020 was 8,000 MW.286 By the end of 2010, that objective \u2018was almost half reached, thus forcing the government to reduce the incentives provided by the Third Energy Account during 2011.\u2019287 In the Respondent\u2019s view, it was plausible to imagine that the expectation that the Third Energy Account would extend until 2013 \u2018should be balanced with the need to meet that objective.\u2019288 The Romani Decree was \u2018merely a way to respect the Italian energy objective\u2019 and the new EU Directive.289\n\nIbid., para. 404; Rejoinder, para. 179, footnote 77.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 405.

Rejoinder, para. 222.\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that the explanation of the failure of the Claimants\u2019 Project falls in the category of business risk, as it is the result of the Claimants\u2019 decision to try to prepare a mega project on paper in order to attract third-party investors instead of deciding to gradually build the plants.300\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 430. The Respondent relies on *Plama v. Bulgaria,* Exhibit CL-20, para. 30. See also Reply, paras. 287-297.\n\n182.\n\nWith respect to the stop-work order, the Respondent notes that the Claimants failed to mention that on 13 January 2012,  ***i.e.***  two days after the issuance of the stop-work order by the municipality of Brindisi, the Regional Administrative Tribunal suspended its effects.301 The Respondent contends that these two days appear to be \u2018completely irrelevant to the conclusion of the work by the deadline of 29 February 2012.\u2019302\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 435; Rejoinder, paras. 205-208.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 436.\n\n(ii) The FET standard and legitimate expectations\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the protection of legitimate expectations \u2018shall be connected with the general principles of good faith and fairness.\u2019303 It also argues that \u2018the assessment of the legitimacy of the expectations is inseparably linked to an assessment of the legitimacy of the State conduct, and in particular to the pursuit of the public interest in the exercise of sovereign prerogatives.\u2019304\n\nIbid., para. 447.\n\nIbid., para. 447.\n\n184.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the expectations alleged by the Claimants have no legitimacy under international law \u2018for the simple reason that they are based on the claim, completely unreasonable, that the State cannot evolve its own legislation according to plausible and verifiable objectives of public interest and in accordance with the fundamental principles of due process, proportionality and nondiscrimination.\u2019305\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 449. The Respondent relies on *Saluka* v. *Czech Republic,* Exhibit CL-39, para. 305; *Parkerings Compagniet* *AS* v. *Republic of Lithuania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, Exhibit RL-24, para. 332; and *Electrabel* v. *Hungary,* Exhibit CL-10. See Rejoinder, para. 195.\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent notes that, unlike situations observed in other investment disputes, the decision of the Constitutional Court, the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account are \u2018forms of exercise of regulatory power in general terms.\u2019306 The Respondent also highlights that, unlike other cases, here the Respondent did not make any promises directed to the Claimants concerning the evolution of its legislation on photovoltaic plants. As a result, the alleged expectations are based solely on the general regulation provided by the Italian State.307\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 451.\n\nIbid., paras. 453-454.\n\n186.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it would be necessary for the Claimants \u2018to demonstrate the profound irrationality of the evolution of this regulation in the years 2010-2012.\u2019308 However, in its view, the decision of the Constitutional Court, the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account were reasonable. The Respondent notes, in particular, the objectives that had been fixed in the Third Energy Account (which would explain the adoption of the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account), and the transitional scheme foreseen in the Fourth Energy Account.309\n\nIbid., para. 456.\n\nIbid., paras. 457-459; Rejoinder, paras. 204-205.\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the stop-work order could not have infringed the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations because the \u2018timely intervention\u2019 of the Regional Administrative Court makes the alleged injury to the expectations non-existent.310\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 465.\n\n2. The alleged breach of Article 13 of the ECT\n----------------------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, to constitute expropriation, the measures shall substantially deprive the investor of the use and enjoyment of the investment. It asserts that, as a result, \u2018it is necessary that there is an appropriate causal link between interference from State measures and deprivation of the benefits of the investment.\u2019311\n\nIbid., paras. 481-482.\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondent contends that there is no evidence of the causal link required to establish the existence of indirect expropriation,312 and therefore the existence of expropriation is excluded.313\n\nIbid., paras. 486-488; Rejoinder, paras. 227-228.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 493.\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that, even if there were evidence of a causal link between the measures and the failure of the fate of the Claimants\u2019 Project, the measures adopted by the Italian Government would fall in the category of non-compensable \u2018regulatory takings\u2019,314 because the measures were adopted in a non-discri minatory manner and aimed at regulating a matter of public interest.315\n\nIbid., paras. 494-496; Rejoinder, paras. 231-232 and 239.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 497-501; Rejoinder, paras. 234-235.\n\nVII. THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES ON QUANTUM\n--------------------------------------------\n\nA. The Claimants\u2019 position\n--------------------------\n\n191.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the damages due as a result of Italy\u2019s breach of Articles 10(1) and 13 of the ECT must be determined according to customary international law. Relying on the ICJ\u2019s Judgment in the *Chorzow Factory* case and on Article 36 of the Draft Articles on State Responsibility, the Claimants argue that reparation must be sufficient to eliminate the consequences of the wrongful acts committed by the State.316 In their view, compensation is generally assessed by reference to capital value, loss of profit and incidental expenses.317 The Claimants also contend that \u2018it is... accepted that the risk of wrongful acts by the State must be excluded in assessing damages caused by such wrongful acts.\u2019318\n\nMemorial, paras. 472-475 and 484.\n\nIbid., para. 476.\n\nIbid., para. 485.\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimants quantified damages using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, which they claim is \u2018in line with arbitral case law.\u2019319 They offer three alternative valuations based on three different valuation dates:\n\n(a) \u20ac187.8 million taking March 2010 as the valuation date, if the Tribunal considers that the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision violated the ECT;320\n\n(b) \u20ac229.5 million taking January 2011 as the valuation date, if the Tribunal considers that the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision did not violate the ECT but all the other measures did;321 and\n\n(c) \u20ac133.5 million taking May 2011 as the valuation date, if the Tribunal considers that only the series of administrative errors and the direct interference by the local authority breached the ECT.322\n\nReply, paras. 343-355.\n\nMemorial, para. 493; Expert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, paras. 20 and 55, and Table 4.

This amount corresponds to Blusun\u2019s 80% interest in the project, based on a project valuation of \u20ac286.9 million.\n\nMemorial, para. 495; Expert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, paras. 22 and 55, and Table 4. This amount corresponds to Blusun\u2019s 80% interest in the project, based on a project valuation of \u20ac166.9 million.\n\n193.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 calculation of damages is based on the following assumptions:\n\n(a) the electricity generation estimate used by Capital Systeme, assuming the entry into operation of 120 MW for the two first valuations, and 113 MW for the May 2011 valuation, given the list published by the GSE in September 2011;323\n\n(b) a 20-year operation period for each plant;324\n\n(c) capital expenses based on the EOS report commissioned by Eskosol and on the Siemens EPC contract;325\n\n(d) a discount rate based on the German Government bonds yield;326 and\n\n(e) a liquidity discount of 15%.327\n\nExpert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, paras. 34-37.\n\nIbid., para. 37.\n\nIbid., para. 37.\n\nReply, paras. 399 *et sec].;* Expert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, paras. 46-47 and 49.\n\nExpert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, para. 50.\n\n194.\n\nTo justify the use of a discount rate based on German Government bonds, rather than Italian Government bonds, the Claimants contend that \u2018using a discount rate that includes the risk of breaching the treaty by the Italian Republic \"would be inappropriate.\u2019\"328 Similarly, the Claimants reject the application of a discount rate derived from a sample of companies specialised in renewable energy because it \u2018would incorporate the same mistrust as reflected in the Italian Government bond yields.\u2019329\n\nReply, para. 400; Expert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, paras. 46-47 and 49. In addition to the damages calculation supported by the Claimants, Mr. Lapuerta calculated the project value using both the Italian and the German bond yields. That calculation, which is not relied upon by the Claimants, results in valuations of \u20ac143.8 million, \u20ac151.7 million and \u20ac82.6 million (for 100% of the project), depending on the valuation date (see Expert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, Table G1.3).\n\nExpert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, paras. 47 and 49.\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimants also claim pre- and post-award interest, based on Italian Government bonds.330 The prejudgment interest claimed until December 2015 is \u20ac6.7 million, assuming that the Tribunal would find that all the measures violated the ECT.331\n\nMemorial, paras. 499-502.\n\nIbid., paras. 409-503; Expert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, paras. 13 and 55.\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimants finally quantified their capital contributions to the Project, which they allege could serve as the basis for the calculation of reliance damages in the event that the Tribunal does not accept the DCF analysis.332 The Claimants estimate their capital contributions to the Project at \u20ac35.5 million.333\n\nExpert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, para. 12 and Table 17; Rebuttal Expert Report of Carlos Lapuerta, para. 58. See also Carlos Lapuerta power point presentation, April 2016, slide 6.\n\nIbid. See also Transcript, Day 5, 128:14- 129:22 (Legum).\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimants reject the adjustments to Mr. Lapuerta\u2019s DCF analysis proposed by the Respondent (described below). They argue that they are intended to reflect events that occurred after Italy\u2019s breaches of the ECT. This, in their view, defeats the purpose of the DCF analysis.334\n\nReply, para. 381.\n\n198.\n\nFinally, as to comparative negligence, the Claimants accept that to the extent that the failure of the Project was due conjointly (in whatever proportions) to the fault of the Claimants and the failure of the investors to proceed with the Project, damages should be reduced accordingly.335\n\nTranscript, Day 6, 37:15-23 (Legum).\n\nB. The Respondent\u2019s position\n----------------------------\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the application of the DCF method in the instant case on the basis that the 120 MW Project was never a going concern.336 The Respondent notes, among other things, that \u2018several months after the date of May 2011, no construction activity of photovoltaic plants had been made at any of the 120 lots\u2019,337 and that the Project was \u2018still on paper.\u2019338\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 516, 528-534.\n\nIbid., para. 531.\n\nIbid., paras. 514 and 532.\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the application of the DCF method would result in \u2018unjustified enrichment.\u2019339 It highlights that, in the present case, the vast majority of the capital needed was not yet invested and there is no evidence of a contractual or quasi-contractual relationship with one or more potential investors.340\n\nIbid., paras. 522, 525 and 539.\n\nIbid., para. 535.\n\n201.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Respondent, the Articles on State Responsibility require the State\u2019s illegal conduct to be not too remotely linked to the damage allegedly caused.341 The Respondent claims that the application of the DCF method in the present case would contradict this requirement. It argues that \u2018the damage that would be considered refundable is in fact largely constructed on events being completely remote with respect to the Italian conduct in question, and clearly uncertain with regard to their occurrence.\u2019342\n\nIbid., para. 544.\n\nIbid., para. 545.\n\n202.\n\nThe Respondent finally alleges that the Tribunal should take into account the Claimants\u2019 contributory fault in assessing the alleged damages. In particular, the Respondent highlights: (i) the Claimants\u2019 decision to implement a 120 MW unified project instead of developing it gradually; (ii) the Claimants\u2019 disregard of the 8,000 MW cap established by the Third Energy Account; (iii) the failure by the Claimants to acquire guarantees from lenders before embarking on the business project; and (iv) the Claimants\u2019 overvaluation of the purchased land.343\n\nIbid., paras. 558-563.\n\n203.\n\nRegarding the assumptions considered in the Claimants\u2019 DCF analysis, the Respondent contends as follows:\n\n(a) the minimum guaranteed price of electricity (MGP) considered by Mr. Lapuerta (which assumes a constant growth of 0.7% per year) is incorrect, because the MGP constantly decreased since May 2011 ;344\n\n(b) Mr. Lapuerta considered a council tax of 5,000 \u20ac/MW, while a realistic assumption is to consider a tax of 15,000 \u20ac/MW;345\n\n(c) the accounting depreciation period for PV plants in Italy is 25 years - not 15 years as assumed by Mr. Lapuerta;346\n\n(d) it is inappropriate to use the German Government bonds yield in order to calculate the discount rate. The Respondent explains that the cost of equity represents the opportunity cost, in terms of perceived risk, of investing capital in a specific business. It is unfounded to use German bond yields to evaluate the equity cash flows of a project like a PV installation in Italy;347 and\n\n(e) Mr. Lapuerta failed to consider the new regulations adjusting incentive tariffs pursuant to Decree 91 of 2014 (the so-called  ***\u2018spalma incentivi\u2018348***\n\nExpert Report of Luca Benedetti, 27 October 2015, p. 14.\n\nIbid., p. 15.\n\nIbid., p. 15..\n\nIbid., p. 16.\n\nIbid., p. 17.\n\n204.\n\nTaking into account these corrections, the Respondent contends that the damages valuation based on a DCF analysis should range between \u20ac19.4 million and \u20ac32.7 million, depending on which of the three options under the *\u2018spalma incentive* regulation is considered, and \u20ac40.4 million if the *\u2018spalma incentivi* regulation is not taken into account.349\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 527; Expert Report of Luca Benedetti, 27 October 2015, p. 17.\n\n205.\n\nThe Respondent also challenges the Claimants\u2019 calculation of reliance damages. It contends that the Claimants failed to consider the liquidation value of the land, and that reliance damages should be assessed on the basis of the \u20ac13.84 million effectively invested as of May 2011 *(i.e.,* the latter of the dates considered by the Claimants for the DCF analysis), not at the end of 2012.350 The Respondent concludes that the maximum possible value of damages refundable to the Claimants is \u20ac12.64 million.351\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 549-552; Expert Report of Luca Benedetti, 27 October 2015, p. 5.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 552; Expert Report of Luca Benedetti, 27 October 2015, p. 5.\n\nVIII. THE EC\u2019S AMICUS CURIAE BRIEF AND THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES ON  ***INTER SE***  APPLICATION OF THE ECT\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. The European Commission\u2019s Amicus Brief\n-----------------------------------------\n\n206.\n\nThe circumstances in which the Tribunal accepted a late-filed EC request to make a non-disputing party submission have already been described (see paragraphs 15 to 31 above). Given that the Respondent effectively endorsed the EC\u2019s request and arguments, the Claimants\u2019 otherwise well-founded plea that ICSID Rule 37(2) is expressly limited to the filing by a non-disputing party of \u2018a written submission... regarding a matter within the scope of the dispute\u2019 was rendered effectively moot. Furthermore, the Tribunal has an obligation *ex officio* to ascertain its jurisdiction.352 The position of the EC and the Parties is set out here and subsequently analysed (see below, paragraphs 211-260 and 277-309).\n\nIn Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal noted that: [P]ursuant to Rule 41(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal \"may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute... is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.\" Without making at this stage any determinations as to the weight that it may give to the arguments raised in the Commission\u2019s Submission, the Tribunal considers that the character of the arguments advanced in the Submission justifies accepting it into the record.\n\n207.\n\nThe EC asserts that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction under the ECT because Member States have only created obligations regarding investment promotion and protection with respect to third countries.353 According to the EC, investors incorporated in a Member State or citizens of a Member State are unable to bring an investment claim against a Member State under Article 26 of the ECT.354\n\n*Amicus* Brief, paras. 1-3.\n\nIbid., paras. 3-4.\n\n208.\n\nAccording to the EC, an EU investor\u2019s investment in another Member State is governed and protected by EU law.355 Article 3(2) of the TFEU prevents Member States from concluding bilateral or multilateral investment agreements that would affect or alter EU law.356\n\nIbid., para. 7.\n\nIbid., para. 7.\n\n209.\n\nThe EC contends that the Member States did not retain the competence to enter into *inter se* obligations with respect to investment protection at the time they ratified the ECT.357 In consequence the relevant Italian court is the appropriate forum for bringing a claim against Italy.358\n\nIbid., para. 9.\n\nIbid., paras. 10-11.\n\n210.\n\nThe EC refers to the decision in *Electrabel,* which in its view is distinguishable from the present case in that Hungary was not a Member State of the European Communities when it ratified the ECT.359 The pivotal issue in that case was whether Hungary\u2019s accession to the EU extinguished its international obligations under the ECT or whether they were superseded through Article 351 of the TFEU and Article 30 of the VCLT.360 In the present case, the EC submits that there never were *inter se* international obligations between the Member States *ab initio.361* The EC also endorses the relevant legal findings of the tribunal in *Electrabel.362*\n\nIbid., paras. 13-14.\n\nIbid., paras. 13-14.\n\nIbid., paras. 13-14.\n\nIbid., paras. 15-17.\n\n1. The legal order of the EU and investment protection under EU law\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\na. The constitutional order of the EU\n-------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nAccording to the EC, the EU has been established based on the Treaty of the European Union *(\u2018TEIT)* and the TFEU, thereby creating a legal order with its own institutions in exchange for which Member States narrowed their sovereign rights.363 In the EC\u2019s view, the European Court and Member States\u2019 domestic courts guard the legal order of the EU, which is implemented through the preliminary ruling mechanism established under Article 267 of the TFEU.364 Furthermore, the EC argues that Member States are bound to ensure compliance with EU law, which also provides remedies for ensuring its application.365\n\nIbid., paras. 23-26.\n\nIbid., para. 27.\n\nIbid., paras. 28-29.\n\nb. The competences of the EU and its Member States\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe EC asserts that competences within the EU are governed by the principle of conferral whereby the EU will act within the limits afforded by the Member States.366 According to the EC, competences are divided between external and internal.367 The latter enables the EC to legislate and adopt binding rules when it has been granted exclusive internal competence, including within the scope of common commercial policy.368 In the EC\u2019s view, the Treaty of Lisbon extended the scope of commercial policy into the area of foreign direct investment.369\n\nIbid., para. 30.\n\nIbid., paras. 31-32.\n\nIbid., paras. 32-34.\n\nIbid., para. 33.\n\n213.\n\nAccording to the EC, it has external competence to conclude international agreements on areas of internal competence, such as investment promotion and protection.370 Member States are therefore prevented from entering into international commitments outside the framework of the EU, or from concluding any international agreement that might affect common rules or impact their scope.371 Furthermore, Member States cannot invoke international agreements as a reason for failing to comply with EU law.372\n\nIbid., paras. 35-38.\n\nIbid., paras. 38-39.\n\nIbid., para. 40.\n\nc. The internal market rules\n----------------------------\n\n214.\n\nThe EC explains that it is created around an internal market that represents an area without boundaries and allows the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.373 Provisions on free movement prevent the adoption of discriminatory measures, non-discriminatory restrictions and expropriation by Member States.374\n\nIbid., para. 41.\n\nIbid., paras. 44-45.\n\n215.\n\nThe EC explains that restrictions on these freedoms may be justified on the grounds described in Articles 52 and 65 of the TFEU, or by \u2018overriding requirements in the general interest.\u2019375 In the view of the EC, justifications must be interpreted based on the general principles of EU law, especially as enunciated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.376\n\nIbid., paras. 45-46.\n\nIbid., paras. 47-48.\n\n216.\n\nAccording to the EC, the protection granted by the freedom of establishment and capital, including the general principles of EU law, extend throughout the lifetime of the investment.377 These protections are complemented by provisions on the internal market and measures adopted by the EU\u2019s legislature.378\n\nIbid., paras. 49-50.\n\nIbid., para. 50.\n\nd. Member States\u2019 ability to agree on investment protection rules outside of the EU\u2019s legal order\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nThe EC contends that EU law did not, even in 1994, permit Member States to agree on investment protection rules between themselves outside of the EU\u2019s legal order for the following reasons.\n\n218.\n\nFirst, the EC argues that international commitments on investment protection between Member States might conflict with the scope of the EU\u2019s common rules as enunciated from time to time.379\n\nIbid., paras. 53-55.\n\n219.\n\nSecond, the EC considers that the ISDS mechanism is inconsistent with the relationship between Member States because the EU does not permit the settlement of intra-EU disputes outside the framework of the EU.380\n\nIbid., paras. 56-61.\n\n2. The lack of  ***inter se***  obligations under the ECT between Member States\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nAccording to the EC, the ECT must be interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, which confirm that the European Communities and its Member States have not created obligations among themselves when entering into the ECT.381 On this view, the ECT is a multilateral agreement concluded with third States.382 It is part of EU law, and the ECJ is competent to determine whether it has direct effect.383 Additionally, the EC can bring enforcement proceedings against Member States for failure to comply with their obligations under the ECT.384\n\nIbid., para. 62.\n\nIbid., para. 63.\n\nIbid., para. 64.\n\nIbid., para. 65.\n\n221.\n\nAccording to the EC, the historical process confirms that the purpose of the ECT was to establish an international framework to cooperate in the energy sector between the European Communities and Eastern Europe, including Russia and the CIS.385 Furthermore, the ECT was already considered part of the European Communities\u2019 external energy policy, as the internal energy market was already under development.386\n\nIbid., paras. 74-77.\n\nIbid., paras. 78-82.\n\n222.\n\nIn the EC\u2019s view, Member States became Contracting Parties of the ECT because they retained competence over certain matters, but this arrangement did not create obligations between Member States.387 The EC rejects Christian Tietje\u2019s position that obligations between Member States in the foregoing context \u2018are the rule\u2019 and that an exception is only applicable when a multilateral agreement contains a disconnection clause.388\n\nIbid., paras. 83-85.\n\nIbid., paras. 86-88.\n\n223.\n\nAccording to the EC, the statement submitted by the European Communities to the ECT Secretariat under Article 26(3)(ii) also confirms that the ECT does not create obligations between Member States.389 The tribunal in *Electrabel* confirmed this understanding.390\n\nIbid., paras. 89-90.\n\nIbid., para. 91.\n\n3. The limited scope of  ***inter se***  obligations between Member States\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n224.\n\nThe EC submits that even if the ECT created mutual obligations between Member States, they would only extend to areas in which Member States possess external competence.391\n\nIbid., para. 92.\n\n225.\n\nSpecifically, the EC considers that Member States are bound by the concept \u2018liability follows competence\u2019 pursuant to Article 64 of the Draft articles on the responsibility of international organizations and the relevant case law, when assessing their international liability.392\n\nIbid., paras. 93-98.\n\n226.\n\nAccording to the EC, the ECT also recognises in several instances a division of external competence between the EU and its Member States.393 In each instance, one must determine whether the competence lies with the Member States or the EU.394 The EC clarified this division of competence through a note submitted to the ECT Secretariat pursuant to Article 26(3)(ii) of the ECT.395\n\nIbid., paras. 99-115.\n\nIbid., para. 115.\n\nIbid., paras. 116-117.\n\n227.\n\nThe EC submits that all provisions within Part III of the ECT fall within the competence of the EU and thus they are binding on the EU396 and that, as a result, in the event of a dispute between the EU and an investor from a third country, the EU will be internationally responsible for any breach.397 The EC contends that because the ECT provisions on investment protection only bind the EU, and not the Member States *inter se,* an EU investor cannot bring a claim against a Member State.398 According to the EC, such a claim would not represent a dispute against another Contracting Party for the purposes of Article 26 of the ECT.399\n\nIbid., para. 118.\n\nIbid., para. 118.\n\nIbid., para. 118.\n\nIbid., para. 118.\n\n228.\n\nMoreover, the EC argues, if the ECT terms are considered ambiguous regarding the mutual obligations between Member States, then the Tribunal should adopt an interpretation that would be consistent with EU law.400 According to the EC, the proper interpretation is that the ECT is inapplicable between Member States, or at least Article 26 of the ECT does not apply between them.401\n\nIbid., paras. 119-120 (relying upon *Electrabel* v. *Hungary,* Exhibit CL-10).\n\nIbid., paras. 120-122.\n\n4. Application of Chapter III and Article 26 ECT under VCLT Article 30\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nThe EC submits that, for purposes of Article 30 of the VCLT, the ECT and the EU Treaties relate to the same subject matter, namely energy.402 Accordingly, while the ECT is an earlier treaty compared to the EU Treaties, the ECT only applies to the extent that its provisions are not incompatible with the EU treaties.403 On that basis, the EC argues that the Tribunal should conclude that Chapter III and Article 26 of the ECT are not applicable between Member States pursuant to Article 30 of the VCLT.404\n\nIbid., paras. 123-124.\n\nIbid., paras. 125-127.\n\nIbid., paras. 128-131.\n\nB. The Respondent\u2019s position\n----------------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent endorses, in principle, the conclusions presented by the EC in its *amicus curiae* brief.405\n\nRespondent\u2019s Position on Jurisdiction of the Tribunal over Intra-EU Disputes  ***(\u2018Respondent\u2019s Position on Jurisdiction\u2019),***  paras. 1-5.\n\n231.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it did not raise jurisdictional objections based on nonapplicability of the ECT between EU investors and EU Member States because it considers that no investment has been concluded under the ECT,406 or that, even if an investment is found to exist, it was established contrary to law and the principle of good faith.407 The Respondent argues that if the Tribunal considers the investment as legitimate, then it would share the EC\u2019s conclusion that the ECT is inapplicable within the EU.408 The Respondent asserts that it was, in part, due to its awareness of the EU\u2019s approach that it denounced the ECT in December 2014.409\n\nIbid., para. 6.\n\nIbid., para. 6.\n\nIbid., para. 7.\n\nIbid., paras. 8-10.\n\n232.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the main issues in this case are to determine the ECT obligations that are imposed upon it as an EU Member State, the allocation of competences in light of EU treaties and the effects on the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.410 The Respondent argues that this approach was followed in the *Electrabel* case.411\n\nIbid., paras. 11-14.\n\nIbid., paras. 15-16.\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the *Electrabel* case is relevant as it provides an understanding of EU law in connection with the ECT and for understanding subsequent disputes.412 Specifically, the Respondent argues that EU treaties, as international law, must be interpreted subject to the VCLT.413 According to the Respondent, EU law being international law, it must also be taken into account by the Tribunal pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT and Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.414 In sum, the Respondent asserts that the jurisdictional issues arising under EU law and raised by the EC fall within the scope of the dispute because EU law impacts the interpretation of the ECT.415\n\nIbid., paras. 20-21.\n\nIbid., para. 21.\n\nIbid., para. 22.\n\nIbid., paras. 23-24.\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent also observes that the Claimants based their Request on their French, German and Belgian nationalities without invoking the Swiss permanent residency acquired by two of the Claimants in 2009 (Lecorcier) and 2011 (Stein).416 In addition, the Respondent argues that the Claimants must satisfy the definition of \u2018Investor\u2019 under both the ECT and the ICSID Convention, which does not contemplate the possibility for a permanent resident to be treated as a \u2018national.\u2019417 Even if permanent residents were considered \u2018investors\u2019 under Article 25(2) of the ICSID Convention (which the Respondent denies), the Respondent argues that at the time of its consent to the ECT (i.e. the date of signature), the two Claimants did not benefit from their status of Swiss permanent residents and therefore would not qualify as a protected \u2018Investor\u2019 under the ICSID Convention.418\n\nIbid., paras. 25-26.\n\nIbid., paras. 27-28.\n\nIbid., paras. 29-30.\n\n1. Interpretation of the ECT under International Law\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the main issue in this case is the extent to which the EU and its Member States intended to become bound *inter se* by the ECT when they entered into that multilateral treaty.419\n\nIbid., para. 31.\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent observes that the definition of \u2018Contracting Party\u2019 in the ECT \u2018includefs] EU Member States, on the one side, and the EU as a regional economic integration organization, on the other.\u2019420 It also notes that the definition of \u2018regional economic integration organization\u2019 shows that EU Member States had transferred a number of competences to the EU with respect to which the EU has regulatory power in the whole territory.421 In the Respondent\u2019s view, the allocation of competences within the EU cannot rely on geographical boundaries but rather on competence by subject matter. This would be confirmed by the recognition of overlapping territories in the definition of \u2018Area\u2019 in Article 1(10).422\n\nIbid., para. 35.\n\nIbid., para. 35.\n\nIbid., paras. 37-38.\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent adds that Article 25 of the ECT seems to specifically recognize that rules of an Economic Integration Agreement prevail and are recognized by the ECT.423\n\nIbid., para. 40.\n\n238.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the declarations and understandings of the Contracting Parties to the ECT also confirm that the ECT does not apply between EU Member States.424 Specifically, the Respondent contends that Annex 2 to the Final Act of the ECT Conference425 shows that the Contracting Parties to the ECT \u2018had clear in mind the issue of treatment of investors from a country that was a Contracting Party to the ECT but not a member of the EU.\u2019426 In the Respondent\u2019s view, in order to avoid double protection, an EU investor would not have the right to invoke Article 26 of the ECT for protecting itself, and it would rather need to invoke EU law and seek a method of redress within that context.427\n\nIbid., para. 44.\n\nThe Respondent refers to a decision regarding Articles 24(4)(a) and 25 of the ECT, which stated that \u2018[a]n Investment of an Investor referred to in Article 1 (7)(a)(ii), of a Contracting Party which is not a Party to an EIA or a member of a free-trade are or customs union, shall be entitled to treatment accorded under such ETA, free-trade area or customs union\u2019, under certain conditions (see Respondent\u2019s Position on Jurisdiction, para 45, citing Annex 2 to the Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Position on Jurisdiction, para. 46.\n\nIbid., paras. 47-50.\n\n239.\n\nThe Respondent also highlights the purpose of the ECT and circumstances surrounding its adoption. It asserts that the historical context underlying the treaty illustrates that it was intended to integrate the energy sectors between the EU and Eastern European States, including Russia, and not to regulate the EU internal energy market which at that time was already under way under its own regulatory system.428\n\nIbid., paras. 52-53.\n\n240.\n\nThe Respondent submits that EU Member States and the EU have consistently followed this approach regarding intra-EU jurisdictional issues.429 According to the Respondent, since the *Electrabel* case, the EU and its Member States\u2019 judicial practice proves that the ECT was not intended to cover intra-EU relations or situations.430\n\nIbid., para. 54.\n\nIbid., paras. 54-56.\n\n241.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the  **Electrabel**  case is relevant for current purposes because it restricts the scope of Article 26 of the ECT to extra-EU disputes, whereas internal disputes must be addressed by the Member States\u2019 domestic courts and the ECJ.431 The Respondent notes, however, that the  **Electrabel**  case is different because it did not focus on whether the ECT would be applicable in that dispute.432 In this case, the Respondent contends that the focus lies on the intent of the Member States when entering into the ECT in light of their obligations under EU treaties.433\n\nIbid., paras. 57-58.\n\nIbid., paras. 59-60.\n\nIbid., paras. 59-60.\n\n242.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the absence of a disconnection clause is not decisive as to the issue of  **inter se**  application. The Member States did enter into *inter se* agreements and their presence cannot be disregarded.434 The Respondent asserts that \u2018the ECT contains Article 16, which is a conflict rule that in fact establishes priorities for both prior and subsequent  **inter se**  agreements.\u2019435\n\nIbid., para. 62.\n\nIbid., para. 62.\n\n243.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Respondent contends that the ECT did not apply *ab initio* to intra-EU situations, as this was not the intention of the Contracting Parties. As a result, Article 26 of the ECT confers no jurisdiction over this dispute.436\n\nIbid., para. 63.\n\n2. The evolution of EU treaties and their impact on the ECT\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nAlternatively, the Respondent asserts that the present state of the law, especially in light of the Lisbon Treaty, shows that intra-EU disputes are not now included within the scope of the ECT.437\n\nIbid., para. 64.\n\n245.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, the main issue - assuming for the sake of argument that the ECT initially had *inter se* effect - is whether the Lisbon Treaty subsequently concluded among some of the ECT\u2019s Contracting Parties is consistent with the ECT itself.438 The Respondent argues that this issue must be assessed in light of Articles 30 and 41 of the VCLT.439\n\nIbid., para. 66.\n\nIbid., para. 66.\n\n246.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the attribution of competences to the EU is governed by the principle of conferral: the EU acts within the competences that have been granted to it by Member States.440 The Respondent submits that common commercial policy falls within the EU\u2019s exclusive competence, whereas energy remains a shared competence.441 The Respondent argues that while the EU\u2019s competences have evolved, Member States retain a duty to cooperate with the EU and are bound to avoid harming the *\u2018effel utile'* of EU law.442\n\nIbid., paras. 67-68.\n\nIbid., para. 68.\n\nIbid., para. 70.\n\n247.\n\nIn the Respondent\u2019s view, since the Lisbon Treaty and the ECT involve the same subject matter, Article 30 of the VCLT applies to their interplay.443 The Respondent also contends that the ECT must derogate from any provision or dispute resolution mechanism of another agreement that is more favourable to the investor or investment, in accordance with Article 16 of the ECT.444 The Respondent argues that EU law guarantees better protection to an investor or an investment than the ECT,445 and therefore the coverage of intra-EU situations regarding FDI by EU law is compatible with the ECT by virtue of Article 16 of the ECT.446\n\nIbid., paras. 75-80.\n\nIbid., para. 81.\n\nIbid., para. 82.\n\nIbid., para. 83.\n\n248.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, regardless of Article 16 of the ECT, one would reach the same conclusion by applying Article 30(4) of the VCLT.447\n\nIbid., para. 84.\n\n249.\n\nLastly, the Respondent alleges that Article 41 (1)(a) of the VCLT allows parties to an agreement to enter into another treaty which modifies the initial agreement among themselves.448 According to the Respondent, the Lisbon Treaty respects the spirit of the VCLT because it did not impact the rights of other Contracting Parties or the performance of their obligations under the ECT.449 Instead, the Respondent contends that the Lisbon Treaty simply increases economic integration, which favours the execution of the ECT,450\n\nIbid., paras. 86-88.\n\nIbid., paras. 89-90.\n\nIbid., para. 91.\n\nC. The Claimants\u2019 position\n--------------------------\n\n250.\n\nIn the first place, the Claimants maintain their objection to the admissibility of the EC\u2019s brief for three reasons. First, the Claimants contend that the issues raised by the EC do not fall within the scope of the dispute because the Respondent did not raise it,451 and that those issues cannot be considered at the Tribunal\u2019s own initiative under ICSID Rule 41(2) because it was untimely.452\n\nClaimants\u2019 Observations on the European Commission\u2019s *Amicus Curiae* Brief  ***(\u2018Claimants\u2019 Observations'),***  paras. 7-8,\n\nIbid., para. 9.\n\n251.\n\nSecond, the Claimants submit that even if the EC\u2019s objection were well-founded, it would have no bearing on the Tribunal\u2019s ability to hear the claims under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.453 It is true that jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is established in this case through the respective nationality of each Claimant.454 But that nationality (which is not in dispute) simply qualifies them to access ICSID arbitration. Consent to arbitration derives from the ECT, and exists regardless of the EC\u2019s position on  ***inter se***  application of the ECT because two of the Claimants are Swiss permanent residents and Switzerland is not an EU Member State.455\n\nIbid., paras. 10-11.\n\nIbid., para. 11.\n\nIbid., para. 11.\n\n252.\n\nThird, the Claimants argue that the Respondent is misguided when it claims that two of the Claimants were not Swiss permanent residents when Italy consented to arbitration under the ECT.456 In the Claimants\u2019 view, the date of consent is when they accepted Italy\u2019s offer to arbitrate, at the time the Request was filed.457 At that time, both Messrs. Stein and Lecorcier were Swiss permanent residents.\n\nIbid., paras. 12-13.\n\nIbid., paras. 12-13.\n\n253.\n\nTurning to the merits of the EC\u2019s position, the Claimants reject it for two reasons. There is no basis to claim that EU Member States lacked competence, in 1994 or now, to enter into *inter se* obligations with respect to investment protection by EU investors.458 EU Member States have full capacity to commit themselves to treaty obligations.459 Second, the Claimants contend that the EU and its Member States are Contracting Parties of the ECT.460 The main issue is the scope of ECT obligations assumed by the Contracting Parties, which can be determined by applying Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT.461 Applying those provisions there is no ground for denying *inter se* application of the ECT.\n\nIbid., para. 1.\n\nIbid., para. 1.\n\nIbid., para. 2.\n\nIbid., para. 3.\n\n1. The ECT creates  ***inter se***  obligations among all Contracting Parties\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Member States\u2019 lack of competence for entering into *inter se* obligations regarding investment protection under the ECT is inconsistent with the principles of sovereignty and *pacta sunt servanda.462* The question is not their competence to act but whether it was exercised in the given case.\n\nIbid., paras. 14-15.\n\n255.\n\nThus whether Member States entered into *inter se* obligations under the ECT is a matter of treaty interpretation.463 While they agree that Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT provide the rules of interpretation, the Claimants note that the Commission has not conducted a textual analysis of the ECT.464 In their view, Article 26 confirms that the ECT applies to disputes between any Contracting Party and an Investor of any other Contracting Party.465 Moreover, Part III on its face entails obligations vis-a-vis each Contracting State\u2019s investors or investments without drawing any distinction between EU Member States and other Contracting States.466\n\nIbid., para. 15.\n\nIbid., paras. 16-17.\n\nIbid., paras. 20-26.\n\nIbid., paras. 27-30.\n\n256.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the ECT\u2019s preparatory works and the circumstances of its conclusion do not constitute \u2018context\u2019 pursuant to the VCLT.467 In the Claimants\u2019 view, Articles 24 and 25 of the ECT are the relevant \u2018context\u2019 for the interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT, and they do not support the EC\u2019s interpretation.468 Recourse to the *travaux preparatoires* is inadmissible when interpretation pursuant to Article 31 VCLT results in a clear and reasonable meaning. But in any event, the *travaux preparatoires* confirm the interpretation based on the ordinary meaning of the text.469 The EC had suggested including a \u2018disconnection clause\u2019 within the ECT, but the other negotiating States rejected that proposal.470\n\nIbid., paras. 31-32.\n\nIbid., paras. 33-45.\n\nIbid., paras. 56-58.\n\nIbid., paras. 59-73.\n\n2. Transfer of competence does not protect EU Member States from responsibility under the ECT\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nIn the Claimants\u2019 view, the EC does not interpret the ECT pursuant to the VCLT but based on EU law.471 But under public international law, EU Member States may not derogate from their ECT obligations on the basis of their membership in the EU.472\n\nIbid., para. 86.\n\nIbid., paras. 87-94.\n\n258.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that the EC has not established that Member States lack competence over investment protection and energy.473 In the Claimants\u2019 view, the EU does not enjoy exclusive competence in those areas, which are shared competences in the internal market.474 According to the Claimants, the Lisbon Treaty\u2019s competence over foreign direct investment is only an external competence, which does not affect EU Member States\u2019 *inter se* relations.475 The Lisbon Treaty has not repealed the ECT, which remains in effect between EU Member States.476\n\nIbid., para. 95.\n\nIbid., paras. 96-102.\n\nIbid., para. 103.\n\nIbid., para. 103.\n\n259.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, arbitral tribunals have regularly rejected the so-called \u2018intra-EU\u2019 jurisdictional objection that has been raised by the EC.477 No fewer than eleven arbitral tribunals have addressed this argument and it has never been successful.478\n\nIbid., paras. 121-130.\n\nIbid., para. 131.\n\n3. The inapplicability of the  ***lex posterior***  principle\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n260.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the EC and the Respondent wrongly contend that Part III and Article 26 of the ECT are inapplicable between Member States pursuant to Article 30 of the VCLT.479 The Claimants\u2019 arguments can be summarized as follows:\n\n(a) The EC has not demonstrated that the ECT\u2019s investment protections under Chapter III and Article 26 are incompatible with EU law.480\n\n(b) Article 30 of the VCLT is not applicable because the ECT and the TFEU do not address the same subject matter.481 In the Claimants\u2019 view, the substantive protections under the ECT and EU law are different as the ECT provides rights and protection that are more extensive than what is offered in the EU\u2019s internal market.482\n\n(c) The ECT has primacy over EU law pursuant to Article 216(2) of the TFEU and based on the ECJ\u2019s jurisprudence.483\n\n(d) The ECT\u2019s provisions are more favourable to investors and investments than EU law; by virtue of Article 16 of the ECT they would take precedence even if they covered the same subject-matter.484\n\n(e) The ECT should also supersede EU law on the basis of Article 30 of the VCLT given its status as *lex specialis* and *lex posterior:*485' In the Claimants\u2019 view, it is incorrect to say that EU law should apply as *lex posterior* to the ECT.486\n\n(f) The Respondent\u2019s reliance on Article 41 of the VCLT is misplaced because it has failed to establish that the Lisbon Treaty is an *inter se* agreement that would enable the EU Member States to derogate from the ECT\u2019s obligations.487\n\nIbid., paras. 133-135.\n\nIbid., paras. 145, 166.\n\nIbid., paras. 168-173.\n\nIbid., para. 174.\n\nIbid., paras. 175-178.\n\nIbid., paras. 180-182.\n\nIbid., paras. 183-191.\n\nIbid., paras. 185-187.\n\nIbid., paras. 192-198.\n\nIX. ISSUES OF JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY: THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S CONCLUSIONS\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. Issues originally raised by the Respondent\n---------------------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal will first consider the issues of jurisdiction and admissibility raised by the Respondent in its Counter-Memorial and maintained in the Rejoinder.\n\n1. The Claimants\u2019 Investment\n----------------------------\n\n262.\n\nAs noted (paragraph 125 above), the Respondent denies that the Claimants have a protected investment, whether under the ECT or the ICSID Convention. It stresses that the Claimants \u2018never placed themselves in the actual condition of collaborating with the Italian development plan of photovoltaic energy through the construction (even gradual) of plants that could benefit from incentive plans, but they simply constituted the pre-conditions for the realization of an ambitious project that would produce that effect.\u2019488\n\nRejoinder, para. 38.\n\n263.\n\nTurning first to the ECT, Article 1(6) contains a typically broad definition of \u2018investment\u2019 and states that it applies \u2018to any investment associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.\u2019 Article 1(5) of the ECT defines \u2018Economic Activity in the Energy Sector\u2019 as \u2018an economic activity concerning the exploration, extraction, refining, production, storage, land transport, transmission, distribution, trade, marketing, or sale of Energy Materials and Products except those included in Annex NI, or concerning the distribution of heat to multiple premises.\u2019 An attached understanding lists as \u2018illustrative of Economic Activity in the Energy Sector\u2019 \u2018(ii) construction and operation of power generation facilities, including those powered by wind and other renewable energy sources.\u2019 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the words \u2018construction and operation\u2019 do not impose a cumulative requirement; if they did, an investor purchasing an already constructed plant would not be covered. Whatever the position with merely preparatory work, e.g. in the preparation of a tender or the negotiation of a concession,489 once an active process of construction of an energy project involving substantial resources is commenced, the merely preparatory phase is over and the project qualifies as an investment. There is no doubt that, assuming the Claimants\u2019 Project was lawful and not merely speculative, it fell squarely within the terms of Article 1(5) and (6) of the ECT.\n\nCf. *Mihaly* v. *Sri Lanka,* Exhibit RL-15.\n\n264.\n\nAs to the lawfulness of the Project, it is true that the ECT does not lay down an explicit requirement of legality, but the Tribunal concludes that it does not cover investments which are actually unlawful under the law of the host state at the time they were made because protection of such investments would be contrary to the international public order. This conclusion is consistent with numerous other decisions and awards.490 In particular, the *Plama* tribunal found that because: \u2018... the ECT should be interpreted in a manner consistent with the aim of encouraging respect for the rule of law... the substantive protections of the ECT cannot apply to investments that are made contrary to law.\u2019491 On the other hand, the mere fact that the Claimants relied on the DIA system of licensing individual plants (a licensing system already employed by the 12 development companies) did not render the Project actually unlawful from its inception. It may or may not have eventually qualified for subsidies, a matter as to which the Claimants took the risk. But they never, insofar as the record shows, misrepresented their Project, and the Respondent, while complaining in general terms of fraud and the like, produces no specific example of conduct by the Claimants which was fraudulent or deceptive, unless it be the subsequent acquisition of multiple plots individually authorised under the DIA procedure. Permits were duly obtained by the 12 development companies under the AU procedure for the sub-stations and the connecting network, and following the acquisition of the companies, Eskosol obtained recognition of the eligibility of almost all the proposed plants (113 of 120) under the Fourth Energy Account (see above, paragraphs 110-112). On the only occasion the Puglia Project was tested at law, before the Regional Administrative Court of Puglia, it survived scrutiny (see above, paragraph 119).\n\nSee e.g. *Yukos v. Russia,* Exhibit CL-22, para. 1352: \u2018An investor who has obtained an investment in the host State only by acting in bad faith or in violation of the laws of the host state... should not be allowed to benefit from the Treaty.\u2019 See also*Plama* v. *Bulgaria,* Exhibit CL-20, paras. 138, 140 and 143; *World Duty Free Company Limited v.

The Court essentially assumes that said formal separation was made in order to keep each plant below the threshold of 60 kW of power, thus benefiting from the simplified authorization procedure and deemed demonstrated the artificial circumvention of the sector rules,..\u2019496 The decision of the Court of Cagliari that the scheme was unlawful was upheld. These (and other lower court decisions cited but not provided to the Tribunal497) raise serious concerns about the legality of authorisation of the investment.\n\nRejoinder, para. 52.\n\n*Cassazione penale* 05/02/2014, No. 11981,5 February 2014, Exhibit RL-36.\n\nIbid.\n\n*Cassazione penale* 25/06/2014, No. 40561,25 June 2014, Exhibit RL-37.\n\n*Cassazione penale* 08/04/2015, No. 16624, 8 April 2015, Exhibit RL-38.\n\nRejoinder, para. 52.\n\n266.\n\nIn their closing submissions,498 the Claimants relied principally on the decision of the Regional Administrative Court of Puglia, which was the only Italian judicial decision specifically concerning the Project and which was *res judicata* as far as the Municipality was concerned. According to that decision, the Puglia Project did not meet the criteria for a deemed single project under Regional Law 31/1998: the plots had never been under single ownership; various persons applied for DIAs, not a single entrepreneur, and there was no question of \u2018several plots resulting from the fractioning of an area of greater extent, carried out within the two years preceding the application\u2019 (Regional Law 31/1998, Art. 3(1)(b)). In short, this was a case of amalgamation of separate plots covered by DIAs, not fractionation of a single earlier plot.\n\nTranscript, Day 6, 23:11 - 29:21.\n\n267.\n\nThe issue of the domestic legality of the Puglia Project is not an easy one. The Regional Administrative Court\u2019s decision concerned a stop-work order, and though it favoured the Claimants and was not appealed, it is by no means clear that it would have withstood subsequent legal action designed to query the provision or level of incentives for this very large project. Nor is it clear that the distinction drawn by the Regional Administrative Court between initial authorisation of plants and their subsequent acquisition would have been maintained (see the later decisions of the *Corte di Cassazione,* summarised in paragraph 265). Moreover, if the position of the project companies was doubtful, it is not clear that Eskosol as purchaser from them would have remained unaffected.\n\n268.\n\nNeither Party called expert evidence on the point, in the absence of which the Tribunal can only do its best with the Italian legal materials at its disposal. In the circumstances, the Tribunal considers as crucial the repeated acts of approval by Italian agencies of the Project, notably the authorisations by the AU procedure of the rings and the substations and the repeated listings of most of the proposed plants under the Fourth Energy Account, which occurred without any deception or misrepresentation on the part of the Claimants. In the end, the Respondent has not demonstrated the illegality of the Project. But this does not mean that the Project was insulated from market concerns as to its potential illegality - concerns such as those which affected the Project following the Constitutional Court decision, and did so without any fault on the part of the Respondent or any great uncertainty as to the legal position (see paragraph 92). The Project may have been protected by the ECT, but as a matter of fact it was not insulated from market uncertainties inherent in the risk of project design and delayed implementation.\n\n269.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s claim that the Claimants had a merely paper project of a speculative character,499 even if this might have been initially true, it ceased to be true once the Claimants invested substantially through their financing of the sub-stations and the rings. Moreover, while there may be doubt as to the speculative character of an investment at an early stage, once this doubt is resolved by substantial measures of implementation, including assumption of financial risk, it should be presumed that the investment was a genuine one, and was correspondingly treaty-protected, from the outset.500\n\nRejoinder, para 38.\n\nFor the \u2018lifetime\u2019 of an investment see *Mondev* v. *United Stales of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2, Award, 11 October 2002, Exhibit CL-123, paras. 79-82.\n\n270.\n\nIn this respect the Claimants point to a number of decisions, under the ECT and BITs, where projects were held to be investments despite never producing nor even being finally licensed to do so.501\n\nE.g. *PSEG* v. *Turkey,* Exhibit CL-125; *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela,* Exhibit CL-113; *Churchill Mining Pic* v. *Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case Nos. ARB/12/14 and ARB/12/40, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 February 2014, Exhibit CL-106.\n\n271.\n\nGiven that the Project was covered as an investment under Article 1(6) of the ECT, it needs little to show that it was equally covered by the ICSID Convention, which contains no separate definition of \u2018investment.\u2019 Even if, as the Respondent argued, one were to apply the *Salini* criteria as interpreted in subsequent decisions,502 the Claimants clearly had an investment for ICSID purposes.\n\n*Salini Costrullori SPA and Italstrade SPA* v. *Kingdom of Morocco,* ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, Exhibit CL-38, paras. 50-58. The *Salini* test was applied, e.g., in *LESl-Dipenta v Algeria,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/08, Award, 10 January 2005, para. II.13(iv); *Bayindirv, Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, Exhibit RL-35, paras. 131-137; *Victor Pey Casado* v. *Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Award, 8 May 2008, para. 233; *Electrabel* v. *Hungary,* Exhibit CL-10, para. 5.43.\n\n2. \u2018Clean hands\u2019/Good faith\n---------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe Respondent also argues for the inadmissibility of the claim on the ground that the Claimants lacked \u2018clean hands\u2019 or were acting in bad faith in pursuing the Project.\n\n273.\n\nThis issue has already been substantially treated under the rubric of the legality of the Project. No evidence has been tendered that Eskosol was guilty of \u2018deceiving the Energy Services Operator on the actual size and nominal power of the photovoltaic plant\u2019, a key basis for the Court of Criminal Cassation decision of 5 February 2014;503 and in the absence of any such evidence, the \u2018clean hands\u2019 doctrine has nothing to operate on. It is therefore unnecessary for the Tribunal to decide whether there exists a generic \u2018clean hands\u2019 defence or ground of inadmissibility in international investment law.504\n\n*Cassazione penale* 05/02/2014, No. 11981,5 February 2014, Exhibit RL-36.\n\nSee J. Crawford, Second Report on State Responsibility, *ILC Ybk* 1999 vol 11(1) paras. 330-4.\n\n274.\n\nUnder the \u2018clean hands\u2019 rubric, the Respondent also argues that the Project was not treaty-protected because of the Claimants\u2019 failure to conduct an EIA:\n\nas for the issue of the obligation of the EIA, the abusive conduct by the Claimants appears contrary to the obligation of good faith not only because it is inconsistent with the *rationale* of domestic law, but also because it is in conflict... with international law, and in particular with [Article 19 of] the ECT...505\n\nRejoinder, para. 79.\n\n275.\n\nArticle 19 of the ECT provides, in so far as relevant:\n\n... each Contracting Party shall strive to minimize in an economically efficient manner harmful Environmental Impacts occurring either within or outside its Area from all operations within the Energy Cycle in its Area... Contracting Parties shall accordingly:\n\n(i) promote the transparent assessment at an early stage and prior to decision, and subsequent monitoring, of Environmental Impacts of environmentally significant energy investment projects[.]\n\nThe Claimants object that claims based on Article 19, contained in Part IV of the ECT (\u2018Miscellaneous Provisions\u2019), are beyond the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, which is confined to Part III (\u2018Investment Promotion and Protection\u2019). But the Respondent does not make any affirmative claim or counterclaim based on Article 19, and it is at least arguable that a tribunal constituted under Part III could take into account conduct clearly in breach of other provisions of the ECT insofar as it is relevant to the admissibility of a claim. The key point, however, is that Article 19 operates not at the level of individual investors but at the interstate level, as is equally the case with the developing general international law of EIAs.506 In so far as there is any requirement for private parties to carry out an EIA for any proposed project, this can only arise under the relevant national law. This is made clear by an Understanding of the Contracting Parties appended to Article 19(1)(i):\n\nIt is for each Contracting Party to decide the extent to which the assessment and monitoring of Environmental Impacts should be subject to legal requirements, the authorities competent to take decisions in relation to such requirements, and the appropriate procedures to be followed.\n\nIn accordance with Article 19(1)(i), it is for the law of the host state to determine the existence and extent of EIA requirements binding on private parties, and it is not enough to appeal to \u2018the *rationale* of domestic law\u2019 in the absence of specific legal requirements.\n\n*Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay),* I.C.J. Reports 2010 (1), Exhibit CL-127, pp. 55-56, para. 101. For more recent discussion, see*Construction of a Road in Costa Rica Along the San Juan River (Nicaragua* v. *Costa Rica),* Judgment of 16 December 2015, paras. 101, 104.\n\n276.\n\nUnder Italian law there is no EIA procedure required for small solar power plants. Large solar plants are subject to a screening process as a result of which an EIA may be imposed. No screening occurred (or seems to have been required) when the project companies obtained approval for the individual plants which would make up the Puglia Project.507 At most, there may have been some uncertainty as to the applicability of the screening procedure given the \u2018aggregative\u2019 character of the Project. But by the time Eskosol acquired the twelve development companies, the time for an EIA was, by parity of reasoning from the 2012 decision of the Puglia Court, past. At the level of the admissibility of claims, it is too late for Italy now to assert that an EIA was \u2018really\u2019 required.\n\nSee the account of Italian law in Claimants\u2019 Reply, para. 129, not denied in the Rejoinder.\n\nB. EU Law and the  ***inter se***  issue\n----------------------------------------\n\n(a) Admissibility of the  ***inter se***  argument\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nClaimants continue to protest508 that the Tribunal should not admit this argument, introduced late by the EC in its request to file a non-disputing party submission, and subsequently adopted by the Respondent (paragraphs 23-31 above). But as the Tribunal has already ruled, it has an obligation to determine its jurisdiction, and the rules of EU law relevant in the matter are part of the applicable law for this Tribunal. The procedural barrier arising from the terms of ICSID Rule 37(2) has been effectively overcome by the Respondent\u2019s belated endorsement of the EC\u2019s position, and any additional costs imposed on the Claimants by this delay on the part of the Respondent can be compensated for in the Tribunal\u2019s final award on costs. Accordingly, the *inter se* argument is admissible.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Observations, paras. 7-9.\n\n(b) The applicable law\n----------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe Parties in effect agree that the applicable law in determining this issue is international law, and specifically the relevant provisions of the VCLT. The Tribunal agrees, but would observe that this does not exclude any relevant rule of EU law, which would fall to be applied either as part of international law or as part of the law of Italy. The Tribunal evidently cannot exercise the special jurisdictional powers vested in the European courts, but it can and where relevant should apply European law as such.\n\n(c) The original scope of the ECT\n---------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nAs a matter of international law, the first question is whether the ECT applied to relations *inter se* of EU Member States as at the date of its conclusion (December 1994) in accordance with Articles 31-33 of the VCLT.\n\n280.\n\nOn its face there is nothing in the text of the ECT that carves out or excludes issues arising between EU Member States.\n\n(1) The preamble to the ECT records that it intends \u2018to place the commitments contained in [the European Energy Charter] on a secure and binding international legal basis.\u2019 This implies that the scope of the (non-binding) European Energy Charter of 17 December 1991 was replicated in binding form in the ECT. There is no indication of any *inter se* exclusion in the Charter, which refers to a \u2018new desire for a European-wide and global co-operation based on mutual respect and confidence\u2019, and further refers to the \u2018support from the European Community, particularly through completion of its internal energy market\u2019 (Preamble, paras. 6, 14). The EC and Euratom were signatories to the Charter. This was of course before the Treaty of Maastricht, let alone the Lisbon Treaty.\n\n(2) Article 1(2) of the ECT defines \u2018Contracting Party\u2019 as \u2018a state or Regional Economic Integration Organization which has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force.\u2019509 EU Member States and the EU are all Contracting Parties. *Prima facie* at least, a treaty applies equally between its parties. It would take an express provision or very clear understanding between the negotiating parties to achieve any other result. Thus when Great Britain was asserting \u2018the diplomatic unity of the British Empire\u2019, it was argued from time to time that multilateral treaties to which the Dominions were separately parties had no  **inter se**  application. The  **inter se**  doctrine was not however accepted, being unsupported by express provision or clear understanding to the contrary.510\n\n(3) There is no express provision (or \u2018disconnection clause\u2019, to adopt recent parlance) in the ECT.511\n\n(4) While the Respondent and the EC relied on the  **travaux preparatoires**  to justify reading in a disconnection clause, this is not permissible in a context in which the terms of the treaty are clear.512 In any case, the  **travaux preparatoires**  seem to point against implying a disconnection clause: one was proposed during the course of the Energy Charter Treaty negotiations, but was rejected.513\n\nArt. 1(3) defines \u2018Regional Economic Integration Organization\u2019 as \u2018an organization constituted by states to which they have transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by this Treaty, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters.\u2019\n\nSee J. Fawcett, *The British Commonwealth in International Law* (1963) 144-94.\n\nFor an express provision, compare the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Montego Bay, 10 December 1982, 1833 UNTS 397, Exhibit CL-189, Art. 35 and Annex IX, esp. Art. 4. See also Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, European T.S. 127, 25 January 1988, Exhibit CL-178, Art. 27(2).\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Exhibit CL-5, Article 32.\n\nSee: Claimants\u2019 Observations, paras. 59-73; Energy Charter Treaty, *Draft Ministerial Declaration to the Energy Charier Treaty,* versions 2-7 (version 7, at 6), 17 March 1994, Exhibit CL-180; and cf. earlier drafts: European Energy Charter Conference Secretariat, *Draft Basic Agreement for the European Energy Charter,* 12 August 1992, Exhibit CL-181, p. 84, para. 27.18.\n\n281.\n\nNeither is there anything in the text to support the EC\u2019s argument that the ECT did not give rise to *inter se* obligations because the EU Member States were not competent to enter into such obligations. The mere fact that the EU is party to the ECT does not mean that the EU Member States did not have competence to enter into *inter se* obligations in the Treaty. Instead, the ECT seems to contemplate that there would be overlapping competences. The term \u2018regional economic integration organization\u2019 (or  ***REIO)***  is defined in Article 1(3) of the ECT to mean an \u2018organization constituted by states to which they have transferred competence over certain matters a number of which are governed by the ECT, including the authority to take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters.\u2019 The Area of the REIO is also defined by Article 1(10) with reference to EU law. But nothing in Article 1, nor any other provision in the ECT, suggests that the EU Member States had then transferred exclusive competence for all matters of investment and dispute resolution to the EU.\n\n282.\n\nThe EC argues that the \u2018Member States... are... presumed to be aware of the rules governing the distribution of competences in a supranational organisation they have themselves created.\u2019514 But if the Member States thought they did not have competence over the *inter se* obligations in the ECT, this would have been made explicit by including a declaration of competence to set out the internal division of competence between the EC and its Member States, as has been done in many other treaties with mixed membership.515 Nothing in the text of the ECT supports the implication of such a declaration of competence.\n\n*Amicus* Brief, para. 104.\n\nFor example, the European Union made such a declaration when acceding to the Food and Agricultural Organisation, in accordance with Article II of the FAO Constitution.\n\n283.\n\nPursuant to Article 6 of the VCLT, every State possesses capacity to conclude treaties and is bound by those obligations pursuant to the principle of *pacta sunt servanda.* No limitation on the competence of the EU Member States was communicated at the time that the ECT was signed. Article 46 of the VCLT provides that a State may not invoke provisions of its internal law regarding competence to conclude treaties to invalidate a treaty unless it was a manifest violation of a rule of fundamental importance. While EU law operates on both an internal and international plane, a similar principle must apply. Even if, as a matter of EC law, the EC has exclusive competence over matters of internal investment, the fact is that Member States to the EU signed the ECT without qualification or reservation. The *inter se* obligations in the ECT are not somehow invalid or inapplicable because of an allocation of competence that the EC says can be inferred from a set of EU laws and regulations dealing with investment. The more likely explanation, consistent with the text of the ECT, is that, at the time the ECT was signed, the competence was a shared one.\n\n284.\n\nThe EC relied on its competence argument to argue that there was also no diversity of territory among the investors and the host State as required by Article 26, since both are part of the same \u2018Contracting Party\u2019 for its purposes?516 It is not necessary for the Tribunal to deal with this argument, since it has held that the European Member States remain \u2018Contracting Parties\u2019 and that the ECT does create *inter se* obligations for European Member States.\n\n*Amicus* Brief, para. 118.\n\n(d) Subsequent modification of the ECT as to  ***inter se***  matters\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nThe Respondent and the EC also argue that, even if the ECT had originally concerned *inter se* matters, this was modified by the fact that the Member States of the EU subsequently entered into other agreements that covered both the investment and dispute resolution aspects of the ECT. The EC states that subsequent EU treaties, such as the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Treaty of Nice, and the Treaty of Lisbon, implicitly repealed the earlier ECT under the *lex posterior* rule in Article 30 of the VCLT, whereby \u2018successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter\u2019 will prevail over the earlier to the extent that the treaties are not compatible.\n\n286.\n\nTurning first to the substantive investment obligations, it is not clear how these are incompatible with the investment rights protected under European law. The EC points to the rules establishing the European internal market, with free movement of goods, persons, services and capital. It states that discriminatory measures or expropriation are not permitted under European law. But these obligations are arguably broader than those in the ECT, and are complementary to them. There is no discrimination unless the same benefits are *not* accorded to other EU States, but there is nothing in the ECT that requires such a result. Were a national of a European State not party to the ECT to bring international arbitration proceedings against a European host State that was a party to the ECT and had breached investment obligations protected under it, that host State would have to determine whether it could, consistent with its EU obligations, decline to consent to such jurisdiction. Nothing in the ECT would prevent the host State from extending its protections beyond those States that are party to it, if this were required to meet these obligations. As the tribunal found in *Electrabel* v. *Hungary,* EU law can be presumed not to conflict or otherwise be inconsistent with the ECT.517\n\n*Electrabel S.A.* v. *Republic of Hungary*, Exhibit CL-10, para. 7.79.\n\n287.\n\nThe only example the EC pointed to where an inconsistency might arise between EU and investment law was the award in *Micula v. Romania.518* In *Micula,* however, the tribunal concluded that EU law was not applicable to the dispute, as Romania had not yet acceded to the EU at the time the impugned measures were taken (although the EC appears to have taken the view that EU rules on state aid did apply during the accession negotiations).519 Any conflict thus arose not out of incompatibility of the relevant BIT with EU law, but out of a disagreement on whether EU rules applied prior to accession. After the  **Micula**  award was issued, the EC notified Romania that it would be in breach of the EU rules on state aid if it complied with its obligation under the award to pay damages to the investors for a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.520 In that context, any conflict related to the implications of enforcement, not to direct contradictions between the substantive rules themselves. This was also the conclusion of both the  **Micula**  tribunal and the *Micula ad hoc* committee.\n\n*Micula et Ors.* v.  **Romania,**  ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013, Exhibit CL-116  ***(\u2018Micula Award');***   *Micula et Ors* v.  **Romania,**  ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Annulment, 26 February 2016, Exhibit CL-251.\n\n*Micula Award,* Exhibit CL-116, para. 319.\n\n*Amicus* Brief, para. 54, note 59; European Commission Decision of 30 March 2015 on State Aid SA.38517(2014/C) (ex 2014/NN) implemented by Romania.\n\n288.\n\nThe Respondent and the EC also argue that the dispute resolution clause, Article 26 of the ECT, is itself incompatible with Article 344 of the TFEU, which provides that \u2018Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than those provided for therein.\u2019\n\n289.\n\nIn the view of the Tribunal, there is no such incompatibility. The dispute before this Tribunal is not an inter-State dispute. It is a dispute, in the words of Article 26, \u2018between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party. \u2019 It is not necessary for this Tribunal to decide whether Article *Tl,* which concerns inter-State disputes, would be incompatible with Article 344 of the TFEU. Even if there were such an inconsistency, this would not also void Article 26, since the later Treaty will supersede the earlier one only to the extent of any incompatibility. To find otherwise would disadvantage investors, who have no ability under European law to protect their investment by suing the host State directly for breaches of the ECT. Neither does anything in European law expressly preclude investor-State arbitration under the ECT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n290.\n\nAs noted (paragraph 260(e) above), the Claimants also relied on the combined effect of the *lex specialis* and *lex posterior* presumptions, the ECT being both more specific than the EU legal order and subsequent to it. Having concluded that there is no incompatibility between the TFEU and the ECT, the Tribunal does not need to address this argument.\n\n291.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal holds that the *inter se* obligations in the ECT have not subsequently been modified or superseded by later European law.\n\n(e) The state of the authorities\n--------------------------------\n\n292.\n\nThe intra-EU issue has been canvassed in greater or lesser depth by previous investment tribunals, which have reached practically common conclusions.\n\n293.\n\nThe majority of these cases were brought under BITs signed before the respondent State became part of the European Union. The main objection, raised in each case either by the Respondent, or by the EC as intervenor, was that entry into the EU had terminated or partially superseded the relevant BIT. Crucial to determining these objections, whether made under Article 59 or 30 of the VCLT, was the compatibility of the ECT with European Law. As set out in greater detail below, the tribunals in question have consistently rejected these objections.\n\n294.\n\nIn *Eastern Sugar B. V.* v. *Czech Republic,* the tribunal held that:521\n\nFree movement of capital and protection of the investment are different but complementary things. If the EU Treaty gives more rights than it does the BIT, then all EU parties, including the Netherlands and Dutch investors, may claim those rights. If the BIT gives rights to the Netherlands and to Dutch investors that it does not give other EU countries and investors, it will be for those other countries and investors to claim their *equal rights.* But the fact that these rights are unequal does not make them incompatible.\n\n*Eastern Sugar B.V.*   ***v.***   *Czech Republic,* SCC Case No. 088/2004 (Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT), Partial Award, 27 March 2007, Exhibit RL-43, paras. 169-170.\n\n295.\n\nIt stated that \u2018the fact that the European Union does not provide for a possibility for an investor to *sue a host stale directly,* and that *in international BIT arbitration* this is an essential feature of most bilateral investment treaties, is in itself sufficient to reject the Czech Republic\u2019s equivalence argument.\u2019522\n\nIbid., para. 180 (emphasis in the original).\n\n296.\n\nThe tribunal in *Rupert Binder* v. *Czech Republic* reached the same result just a few months later, holding that the BIT remained in force notwithstanding that the Czech Republic was now part of the European Union.523 It held that:524\n\nIntra-EU investor-state arbitration is not inconsistent with the EC legal order. Investor-state arbitration is not addressed by EC law, and the EC legal order has not offered a substitute for investor-state arbitration. ... As there is no conflict between the Czech-German BIT and EC law, the primacy of EU law is a moot point.\n\n*Rupert Binder* v. *Czech Republic,* Award on Jurisdiction (UNCITRAL Rules), 6 June 2007, Exhibit CL-212.\n\nIbid., paras. 40, 42.\n\n297.\n\nIn *Eureko v. Slovakia,* the tribunal also held that there was no inconsistency between EU law and the BIT.525 Rather, \u2018the BIT establishes extensive legal rights and duties that are neither duplicated in EU law nor incompatible with EU law.\"526 The same conclusion was reached in *Micula* v. *Romania,527* in an award that was upheld on annulment.528\n\n*Eureko B.V.* v. *Slovakia,* PCA Case No. 2008-13, Award on Jurisdiction, Arbitrability and Suspension, (UNCITRAL Rules), 26 October 2010, Exhibit RL-44.\n\nIbid., para. 245.\n\n*Micula Award,* Exhibit CL-116, para. 319.\n\n*Micula el Ors* v. *Romania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Annulment, 26 February 2016, Exhibit CL-251.\n\n298.\n\nIn  **Electrabel**  v. *Hungary,* brought pursuant to the ECT,529 the tribunal held that European law and the ECT \u2018are not in fact inconsistent or otherwise contradictory\u2019, but could be interpreted as being complementary.530 While the tribunal went on to consider what would happen if there were a material inconsistency, concluding that in such a case EU law must prevail, this discussion was hypothetical.531 The tribunal did not view European law as an obstacle to its jurisdiction. While the Respondent in this case argues that the award restricts the scope of Article 26 of the ECT to extra-EU disputes, there is nothing in  **Electrabel**  to support or require that conclusion.532\n\n*Electrabel* v. *Hungary,* Exhibit CL-10, para. 7.79.\n\nIbid., para. 4,172.\n\nIbid., paras. 4,189, 4,191.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Position, paras. 57-58.\n\n299.\n\nThe EC argues that it is not appropriate to draw analogies with *Electrabel,* since, like the other authorities discussed above, the host State was not a member of the European Union when it signed the relevant BIT. This contrasts to the present case, in which the Respondent and the investors\u2019 States were each part of the European Union at the time of the signing of the ECT.533 But what is significant in *Electrabel* is that the tribunal found that the ECT and European law were complementary; it is irrelevant to this determination that Hungary was not part of the European Union at the time that the ECT was signed, since the question was whether the ECT was partially superseded or terminated subsequently by its entry into the EU. The same issue arises in the present case in relation to Article 30 of the VCLT.\n\n*Amicus* Brief, para. 13.\n\n300.\n\nA more recent award on the intra-EU issue, *Charanne* v. *Spain,* involved a State that was party to the EU at the time that it signed the ECT, which was invoked as the basis of jurisdiction.534 The award became available only after most of the written pleadings had been filed in this case, save for the Claimants\u2019 Observations on the European Commission\u2019s *Amicus* Brief. However, at the Tribunal\u2019s request, it was canvassed thoroughly at the oral hearings.\n\n*Charanne B.V. Construction Investments S.A.R.L.* v. *Kingdom of Spain,* SCC Arbitration, 21 January 2016  ***(Charanne v. Spain),*** Exhibit CL-208.\n\n301.\n\nIn *Charanne,* the tribunal considered that the objections made by the EC and the Respondent fell into three categories: (a) no diversity of territories between the investor and the Respondent, since the investor\u2019s State and the host State were both part of the European Union; (b) an implicit disconnection clause could be read into the ECT; and (c) that the dispute resolution mechanism in Article 26 is incompatible with EU law. The tribunal rejected all three arguments. It held that neither the ECT itself, nor the fact that the EU was a Member State, prevented an EU member State from being sued by an investor of another Member State of the ECT.535 There was no lack of diversity, since the investors were of a different nationality to the host State.536 Neither was it appropriate to imply a disconnection clause into the ECT. The text itself was clear and provided no basis for doing so. Moreover, a distinction was to be made between an inter-State dispute and an investor-State dispute. Even if Article 267 of the TFEU meant that no intra-EU dispute could be resolved by an *ad hoc* arbitral tribunal under Article 27 of the ECT, that did not preclude the jurisdiction of an investor-State tribunal under Article 26 of the ECT.537 Finally, the tribunal held that there was no contradiction between ECT and EU law.538 It upheld its jurisdiction over the dispute.\n\nIbid., para. 429.\n\nIbid., para. 432.\n\nIbid., paras. 434-438.\n\nIbid., paras. 440-449.\n\n302.\n\nDespite the fact that the EC has intervened in many other intra-EU arbitrations, as far as has been publicly reported, no tribunal yet has upheld this objection to jurisdiction.539\n\n*RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.)

The tribunal in each case has found that the relevant BIT or the ECT was intended to bring about binding obligations between EU Member States. The tribunals found no contradiction between the substantive provisions of EU law and the substantive or dispute resolution provisions of the BITs. No such system for investor-State arbitration exists in EU law, and it would be incorrect to characterise such disputes as inter-State disputes such that Article 267 of the TFEU could be said to preclude jurisdiction. These conclusions support those adopted by the Tribunal in this case.\n\n(f) Relevance of the individual Claimants\u2019 Swiss permanent residence\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nIn the alternative, the two individual Claimants argue that they have standing as \u2018Investors\u2019 under the ECT as Swiss permanent residents, even if Blusun as a Belgian corporation does not. While the Tribunal has ruled that Blusun does have standing under Article 26 of the ECT as an \u2018investor\u2019, it will nevertheless consider the nationality of the other Claimants. The argument arises from the definition of \u2018Investor\u2019 in ECT Article I:\n\n(7) \u2018Investor\u2019 means:\n\n(a) with respect to a Contracting Party:\n\n(i) a natural person having the citizenship or nationality of or who is permanently residing in that Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law;...\n\nMr. Lecorcier, the majority shareholder in Blusun, became a Swiss permanent resident in January 2009, thus before the events giving rise to the present claim. Mr. Stein, holding the rest of the shares, only became a Swiss permanent resident in January 2011, at which stage most of those events had occurred and as such could not form the basis of any claim by him.\n\n305.\n\nIn support of this argument the Claimants rely on the decision in *Feldman v. United Mexican States.540* At stake was an analogous provision concerning permanent residents in NAFTA Article 201. Feldman, a US citizen, was also a permanent resident of Mexico, which argued that as between the two, the dominant status should be treated as effective, by analogy with the principle of dominant nationality in cases of dual nationality. The tribunal rejected that view, holding that \u2018permanent residents are treated like nationals in a given State Party only if that State is different from the State where the investment is made.\u2019541 But it accepted that the investor might be a permanent resident of a third State party to the relevant treaty. Transposed to the present case, this implies that a French national could bring an ECT claim against Italy if that person was also Swiss permanent resident at the relevant times, i.e., at the time of the alleged breach and of the request for arbitration.\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa* v. *United Mexican Slates* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/l), Interim Decision on Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues, 6 December 2000, Exhibit CL-252.\n\nIbid., para. 34.\n\n306.\n\nThe EC did not address this issue in its *Amicus* Brief. Its key argument was that \u2018Union law does not allow Member States to agree investment protection rules *inter se,* outside the Union legal order\u2019,542 but this ignores the point that the relevant agreement for present purposes is between Italy and Switzerland, not an EU Member.\n\n*Amicus* Brief, para. 52.\n\n307.\n\nIn its submission regarding the EC\u2019s *Amicus* Brief, the Respondent argued that Mr. Lecorcier was not a Swiss permanent resident at the time of conclusion of the ECT.543 But it is settled that the relevant time for consent is the date of filing the Application.544 It also argued that \u2018Article 25(2)(a) [of the ICSID Convention] is self-standing and cannot be softened by reference to the letter of the ECT: either both treaties are satisfied, and the Claimants are *nationals* of a Contracting State, or they cannot receive protection under an ICSID arbitration.\u2019545 In its oral argument in closing, Italy took the different point (and took it rather diffidently) that under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention Mr. Lecorcier was appearing as a French national and that he could not thereafter rely on a different status for the purposes of application of substantive law.546 But under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention there is no necessary identity between the provision conferring jurisdiction (and standing under the Convention), on the one hand, and that determining the substantive law, on the other hand.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Position on Jurisdiction, para. 29.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Observations, para. 12, referring to relevant case law.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Position on Jurisdiction, para. 30.\n\nTranscript, Day 5, 157:8-12 (Fiorentino).\n\n308.\n\nIf it were necessary to do so, the Tribunal would be inclined to uphold Mr. Lecorcier\u2019s standing under the ECT as a Swiss permanent resident, though that would be limited to a claim for damages suffered by him personally. But where the primary victim of a breach is a company, any remedy would normally enure to the benefit of the company, avoiding potential difficulties including double recovery.547 The Claimants made it clear that their primary claim was that of Blusun itself, which on any view is an intra-EU claim.\n\nNAFTA Arts. 1117, 1121 and 1126 partly address this issue. There is no equivalent in the ECT.\n\n(g) Conclusion\n--------------\n\n309.\n\nFor these reasons, and in common with the other investment tribunals which have considered the question, the Tribunal rejects the intra-EU objection to its jurisdiction. In its view, the ECT continues to apply *inter se,* as between the member states of the EU, under international law. The Tribunal accordingly has jurisdiction over the claims of all three Claimants.\n\nX. THE MERITS: THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S APPRECIATION\n------------------------------------------\n\n310.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 case on the merits is comparatively simple. It was put in opening as follows:\n\nthere was no other large solar project comparable to that of the Claimants\u2019 built in Italy in the years 2010 and 2011. This was due to the lack of construction project financing, which in turn was the result of the legal insecurity created by the Italian State. On this record, there is thus a clear causal link between the series of measures adopted by Italy and the project\u2019s failure. Because of the persisting legal insecurity created by the state, potential investors were deterred from investing in the project during the period from March 2010 to September 2011. Then the self-redress proceedings and stop-work orders gave the final blow to the project in late 2011/early 2012.548\n\nAs this passage in effect concedes, the immediate cause of the Project\u2019s failure was the absence of construction financing. Lacking completely any revenue and with substantial debts, the insolvency of the project companies was inevitable. Italy is to be held responsible for this failure, according to the Claimants\u2019 case theory, because it caused legal insecurity in the relevant period in breach of the ECT, and this was the effective cause of the failure to attract financing.\n\nTranscript, Day 1,96:12-24 (Dufetre).\n\n311.\n\nIn support of this general claim, the Claimants rely separately on Articles 10(1), first sentence (legal stability), 10(1), second sentence (fair and equitable treatment, with emphasis on legitimate expectations), and 13 (expropriation) of the ECT.549 These three claims will be taken in turn.\n\nReply, para. 160.\n\nA. The Legal Instability Claim: ECT Article 10(1)\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.\n\n1. The interpretation of Article 10(1)\n--------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe key obligation on which the Claimants rely for their legal instability claim is the obligation to \u2018encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area\u2019 (Article 10(1), first sentence). Reference should also be made to the following definition in Article 1(8):\n\n(8) \u2018Make Investments\u2019 or \u2018Making of Investments\u2019 means establishing new Investments, acquiring all or part of existing Investments or moving into different fields of Investment activity.\n\n314.\n\nIn *PSEG Global* v. *Turkey,* the tribunal found a breach of the fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard by reference to what it described as:\n\n... the \u2018roller-coaster\u2019 effect of the continuing legislative changes. This is particularly the case of the requirements relating, in law or practice, to the continuous change in the conditions governing the corporate status of the Project, and the constant alternation between private law status and administrative concessions that went back and forth.550\n\nIn the same vein, the tribunal, while emphasising the relevance of the changing attitudes and policies of the administration, concluded that \u2018[s]tability cannot exist in a situation where the law kept changing continuously and endlessly, as did its interpretation and implementation.\u2019551 This was not a decision under the ECT; moreover, the \u2018roller-coaster\u2019 dictum was only one among several reasons the tribunal gave for its finding of breach. It remains to be seen whether a similar analysis could be applied to Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\n*PSEG* v. *Turkey,* Exhibit CL-125, para. 250.\n\nIbid., para. 254.\n\n315.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the answer is no, for a variety of reasons.552\n\n(a) The language of the first sentence is vague and generic, and overlaps with the following sentences, thus favouring \u2018an interpretation that conceives the first sentence of Art. 10 in terms of general duty, as a chapeau of a legal \"container\" - the whole Art. 10.1 - which includes specific and binding obligations for states (such as the FET and the principle of non-discrimination).\u2019553 But the first sentence is not in merely preambular terms, nor is it (unlike Article 10(2)) expressed as a mere aspiration.554 Indeed, all five sentences in Article 10(1) are framed as obligations of apparently equal weight, and all use the mandatory \u2018shall.\u2019 It is true that there is considerable flexibility allowed by terms such as \u2018encourage\u2019, \u2018favourable\u2019 and \u2018transparent\u2019, but the same is true of \u2018equitable\u2019 which, at least in the second sentence in the familiar copula \u2018fair and equitable\u2019, the Respondent acknowledges to have a determinate meaning. On the footing that the term \u2018stable\u2019 does not mean rigid or unchanging (which the Claimants do not suggest) the first sentence can nonetheless be given due effect.\n\n(b) But only in accordance with its actual language; the Respondent emphasises the limited scope of the phrase \u2018Make investments\u2019 when read with the definition in Article 1(8). Once the Claimants had acquired the lands and rights associated with the Project, they had made their investment: thereafter they did not establish new investments, acquire all or part of existing investments or move into different fields of investment activity. The \u2018stability\u2019 element of Article 10(1), first sentence, is thus inapplicable here *in its own terms.555*\n\n(c) In the Tribunal\u2019s view, little turns on the interpretive argument based on Article 1(8), because the second sentence of Article 10(1) goes on to stipulate that the stable conditions to be created under the first sentence \u2018shall include a commitment to accord *at all limes* to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment\u2019 (emphasis added). In effect, as various tribunals have pointed out, the obligation to create stable conditions is conceived as part of the FET standard which is generally applicable to investments by virtue of the second sentence.556 The Respondent in effect agrees:\n\nthe obligation of FET... already contains the requirements of stability and transparency of the treatment. The FET standard represents the mandatory specification of the general provision contained in the first sentence. On the other hand, it is not clear which state conduct could be considered lawful on the basis of the FET standard and unlawful on the basis of Art. 10.1 first sentence.557\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, paras. 365-366, 378, the Respondent argued that claims under Art. 10(1), first sentence, were \u2018not directly enforceable by investors.\u2019 The argument was not pursued in the Rejoinder or subsequently, and rightly not.\n\nRejoinder, para. 91.\n\nArt. 10(2) provides that: \u2018Each Contracting Party shall *endeavour* to accord to Investors of other Contracting Parties, as regards the Making of Investments in its Area, the Treatment described in paragraph (3)\u2019 (emphasis added). Para. (3) describes MFN or national treatment \u2018as regards the Making of Investments.\u2019\n\nRejoinder, paras. 92-105.\n\nSee e.g.*Plama* v. *Bulgaria,* Exhibit CL-19, para. 172;*Electrabel v. Hungary,* Exhibit CL-10, para. 7.73.\n\nRejoinder, para. 116.\n\n316.\n\nOn the basis that Article 10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT apply to a \u2018legal instability\u2019 claim said to arise in the course of an existing investment, the next question is the scope of the host state\u2019s obligation in that regard. The Claimants referred to a number of cases in which tribunals were supportive of such claims.558\n\nSee e.g. *Electrabel* v. *Hungary,* Exhibit CL-10, para. 7.79.\n\n317.\n\nThe decision in *Charanne B. V. Construction Investments S.A.R.L.* v. *Kingdom of Spain* deserves attention as the first of many pending \u2018green energy\u2019 cases under the ECT to be decided on the merits,559 and at the Tribunal\u2019s request it was the subject of detailed argument in closing. That was not really a \u2018legal stability\u2019 claim, as later developments in Spanish legislation (especially the 2013 Law) were excluded from the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as a result of the way the claimant framed its case: the effect was to focus on a single law of 2010. The tribunal, having affirmed its jurisdiction, rejected the claim, on the ground that the laws in force were subject to reasonable change consistently with the fair and equitable treatment standard and that there could be no legitimate expectation to the contrary. In particular, the tribunal drew a sharp distinction between a \u2018regulatory standard\u2019 and \u2018a specific commitment of the state\u2019, as in the following passage:\n\nAlthough RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 were directed to a limited group of investors, it does not make them to be commitments specifically directed at each investor. The rules at issue do not lose the general nature that characterizes any law or regulation by their specific scope. To convert a regulatory standard into a specific commitment of the state, by the limited character of the persons who may be affected, would constitute an excessive limitation on power of states to regulate the economy in accordance with the public interest.560\n\nIt concluded:\n\nunder international law... in the absence of a specific commitment toward stability, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that a regulatory framework such as that at issue in this arbitration is to not be modified at any time to adapt to the needs of the market and to the public interest.561\n\nBut this did not mean the ECT imposed no constraint on legislative change:\n\nan investor has a legitimate expectation that, when modifying the existing regulation based on which the investment was made, the State will not act unreasonably, disproportionately or contrary to the public interest.\n\n...\n\nAs for proportionality, the Arbitral Tribunal considers that this criterion is satisfied as long as the changes are not capricious or unnecessary and do not amount to suddenly and unpredictably eliminat[ing] the essential characteristics of the existing regulatory framework.562\n\nThe Spanish laws at stake in that case did not breach ECT Article 10 because in the tribunal\u2019s view they \u2018introduce[d] limited amendments to the regulatory framework existing at the time of the investment without eliminating its essential characteristics, in particular the existence of a guaranteed tariff throughout the life of the facility.\u2019563\n\n*Charanne v. Spain,* Exhibit CL-208 and Exhibit CL-208-bis.\n\nIbid., para. 493.\n\nIbid., para. 510.\n\nIbid., paras. 513, 517. In contrast Arbitrator Tawil (dissenting) held that \u2018when an investor complies with all the requirements established by the legislation in force to be granted a specific and particular benefit, its subsequent ignorance by the host State of the investment violates a legitimate expectation\u2019 contrary to ECT Art. 10(1) (dissenting opinion, para. 12).\n\nIbid., para. 539.\n\n318.\n\nOf the three criteria suggested in *Charanne,* \u2018public interest\u2019 is largely indeterminate and is, anyway, a judgement entrusted to the authorities of the host state. Except perhaps in very clear cases, it is not for an investment tribunal to decide, contrary to the considered view of those authorities, the content of the public interest of their state, nor to weigh against it the largely incommensurable public interest of the capital exporting state. The criterion of \u2018unreasonableness\u2019 can be criticized on similar grounds, as an open-ended mandate to second-guess the host state\u2019s policies. By contrast, disproportionality carries in-built limitations and is more determinate. It is a criterion which administrative law courts, and human rights courts, have become accustomed to apply to governmental action.\n\n319.\n\nThe present Tribunal, on the basis of a balanced interpretation of the text of Article 10 read in the light of its object and purpose, and having due regard to the course of its interpretation so far, would reach the following conclusions:\n\n(1) The five sentences of Article 10(1) embody commitments towards investments, in accordance with their terms. None is merely preambular or hortatory.\n\n(2) The requirement to \u2018encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area\u2019 is not limited to the initial making of the investment but includes subsequent extensions of the investment as well as changes of form.\n\n(3) But the core commitment is that in the second sentence, expressly included in the first, \u2018to accord *at all times* to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment\u2019 (emphasis added). This incorporates the fair and equitable treatment standard under customary international law and as applied by tribunals.564\n\n(4) That standard preserves the regulatory authority of the host state to make and change its laws and regulations to adapt to changing needs, including fiscal needs, subject to respect for specific commitments made.\n\n(5) In the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But if they are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime.\n\nTo similar effect, *Plama* v. *Bulgaria,* Exhibit CL-19, paras. 161-173.\n\n2. The legal instability claim\n------------------------------\n\n320.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 case as pleaded largely turns on the claim of legal instability:\n\nOur claim is not that Italy\u2019s legislation had to remain immutable, unchanged, written in stone. This case is not about regulatory change; it\u2019s about regulatory turbulence. It concerns the fact that during the two years between permissible and legally impossible, the legal framework for the project constantly changed, leaving no period of stability in which the requisite capital investment for a project of this size could be realised.565\n\nTranscript, Day 1, 23:13-21 (Legum).\n\n321.\n\nThe Claimants identify four occasions of damaging legal instability in relation to the Puglia Project: (a) the Constitutional Court decision and its aftermath; (b) the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account; (c) the uncertainties associated with the publication of multiple lists of eligible plants by GSE; and (d) the Brindisi stop-work order and related events. They do not, however, suggest that these events were directly linked or that the sequence was the result of any design on the part of the Italian State. This was no conspiracy but a series of disconnected acts of alleged disregard for their rights. Whether there was a breach of Article 10(1), first sentence, of the ECT must therefore fall to be determined, at least in the first instance, by examining each of the state acts complained of against ECT standards.\n\n(a) Decision 119 of 26 March 2010 of the Constitutional Court\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n322.\n\nIn December 2008, the central Government initiated proceedings before Italy\u2019s Constitutional Court challenging, *inter alia,* the constitutionality of Article 3 of Puglia\u2019s Regional Law 31/2008 which provided for DIA authorisations for plants with electric power capacity between 20 KW and 1 MW. The central Government argued that Article 3 of Puglia\u2019s Regional Law 31/2008 infringed Legislative Decree 387/2003 which permitted the application of the simplified DIA procedure only to plants with capacity up to 20 KW whereas the Puglia Region contended that the Regional Law fell within Puglia\u2019s concurrent jurisdiction under Article 117 of the Italian Constitution.566 There was no parallel challenge to Regional Law 1/2008.567\n\n*Corte Cost., 26 marzo 2010, n. 119* (Constitutional Court, 26 March 2010, No. 119), Exhibit CL-81.\n\nSome 38 of 120 plants making up the Puglia project were authorized under Regional Law 1/2008 and were unaffected *by* the decision: Transcript, Day 2, 183:2-10 (Bacchiocchi).\n\n323.\n\nThe Constitutional Court, in March 2010 (a not-unreasonable delay of 15 months), upheld the challenge. In its decision of 26 March 2010, the Constitutional Court found that Article 3(1) and (2) of Regional Law 31/2008 was contrary to Article 12(5) of Legislative Decree 387/2003 and declared it unconstitutional. The Court held:\n\n... the regional provision is illegal, since higher thresholds of generation capacity and characteristics of the installation sites for which the DIA procedure can be used can be identified only by means of a decree of the Minister of Economic Development, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and the Protection of the Territory and Sea, in agreement with the Joint Conference, without the possibility for the Region to identify them on its own...568\n\n*Curie Cost., 26 marzo 2010, n. 119* (Constitutional Court, 26 March 2010, No. 119), Exhibit CL-81, para. 4.2.\n\n324.\n\nUnder Article 136 of the Italian Constitution, a provision that is declared unconstitutional ceases to have effect on the day following the publication of the decision by the Constitutional Court. But according to Italian case law, Constitutional Court\u2019s decisions declaring the unconstitutionality of a law have no retroactive effect on \u2018consolidated relationships\u2019 *(\u2018rapporti esauriti\u2019* or *\u2018rapporti consolidate\u2018).569* \u2018Consolidated relationships\u2019 stem from judgments or administrative acts which are final (i.e. can no longer be challenged).\n\n*Cass., sez. Ill, 28 luglio 1997, n. 7057,* 28 July 1997, Exhibit CL-75.\n\n325.\n\nThe Government took the position that the DIA status of plots which had been fully processed under Regional Law 31/2008 was \u2018consolidated\u2019 and was thus unaffected by the decision. It responded in these terms to an inquiry on behalf of Eskosol.570\n\n*Circolare Ministeriale 15 dicembre 2010* (Ministerial Circular of 15 December 2010), Exhibit CL-48, p. 9\n\n326.\n\nHowever, as recounted in paragraphs 93-95 above, the Salva/Alcoa law of 13 August 2010 somewhat muddied the waters: in providing a special 150-day time limit for DIA applications in progress, the Law was taken by some as impliedly abrogating the status of consolidated relationship for other applications.\n\n327.\n\nWatson, Farley and Williams acting on behalf of Eskosol sought clarification on this point: in a letter of 3 December 2010, the Department of Legal Affairs of GSE responded as follows:\n\nIf the plants... authorized between August and September 2008, comply with all the requirements, including with the technical standards resulting from the applicable rules, such as the decisions of the Authority for the Electric Energy and Gas, and unless the competent administrative authorities should rule in a different manner with regard to the interpretation of Article 1 - *quater* of the Decree Law 105/2010 approved, with its amendments, by Law 129/2010, it is held that admission to the incentives under the so-called Energy Account is possible, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable legislation.571\n\nGSE, fax of 3 December 2010, Exhibit C-145, responding to letter of 25 November 2010, Exhibit C-140.\n\n328.\n\nShortly thereafter, the Ministry of Economic Development issued a Circular clarifying the effects of the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision. Reciting that it was based on \u2018numerous requests for Clarification\u2019, the Circular made it clear that the decision had no effect on consolidated relationships, and as to pending DIAs it extended the time limit for connection to the grid to 16 January 2011.572 The Circular sought to set a regulatory balance between - on the one hand - the protection of the legitimate reliance of operators who have achieved a qualifying title on the basis of regional laws subsequently declared unconstitutional and - on the other hand - not allowing for an indefinite time the entry into operation of plants which do not comply with the prevailing national framework.573\n\n*Circolare Ministeriale 15 dicembre 2010* (Ministerial Circular of 15 December 2010), Exhibit CL-48.\n\nIbid.\n\n329.\n\nThe Tribunal would make the following points with respect to this episode:\n\n(a) The Government\u2019s challenge before the Constitutional Court was duly filed and was plainly arguable.\n\n(b) The challenge was filed well before the Claimants made their investment. The fact of the challenge was public knowledge and was known to the Claimants.574\n\n(c) The decision did not result in a loss of rights to Blusun or its affiliates. True, there seems to have been some initial market uncertainty, which the Government might have done more to dispel. But there was no real doubt about the applicable legal regime in case of a declaration of unconstitutionality, and the Government did not fail to act with due diligence.\n\n(d) In any event, the content of the public law of the host state (including its process of determining the constitutionality of laws) is a matter on which investors like anyone else have access to independent advice. If it avoids outright misrepresentation, the Government does not offer warranties in that regard.\n\n(e) To conclude, in proceeding with the Project in full knowledge of the pending constitutional challenge, the Claimants took the risk that the challenge might succeed, and that this might cause delay over the Project and its financing.575\n\nLecorcier WS2, para. 47.\n\nAs the *Saluka* tribunal pointed out in a different context *(**Saluka v. Czech Republic,* Exhibit CL-39, para. 360), an investor who is aware of a difficulty at the time of investing can have no expectation of remedial action.\n\n330.\n\nFor these reasons, the Constitutional Court decision and its aftermath did not breach Article 10(1), first sentence, of the ECT.\n\n(b) The Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nEU Directive 2009/28 was implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree 28 of 3 March 2011,576 also known as the \u2018Romani Decree\u2019 after the name of the new Italian Minister for Economic Development. The Romani Decree gave rise in turn to the Fourth Energy Account. The Tribunal notes that European Directives, while giving States some discretion, impose obligations on them. In the case of EU Directive 2009/28, Member States were required to \u2018bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 5 December 2010.\u2019577\n\nRomani Decree, Exhibit CL-51.\n\nDirective 2009/28/EC, of the European Parliament and of the Council on the Promotion of the Use of Energy from Renewable Sources and Amending and Subsequently Repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC, 2009 O.J. (L 140) 16, Exhibit CL-7, Article 27.\n\n332.\n\nThe Romani Decree amended the conditions for access to feed-in tariffs under the Third Energy Account of photovoltaic plants with capacity up to 1 MW. In particular, it sharply limited the applicability of the Third Energy Account (originally covering plants that became operative between 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2013) to photovoltaic plants that commenced operations by 31 May 2011 (Article 25(9)).\n\n333.\n\nIn addition, the Romani Decree introduced modifications in the criteria for eligibility to the feed-in tariffs of photovoltaic plants installed in agricultural areas. Under Article 10(4) photovoltaic plants located in agricultural areas would be eligible for feed-in tariffs on the condition that their capacity was below 1 MW and they occupied less than 10% of the plot of land where they were installed. Plants belonging to a single owner would additionally have to be located at a distance of at least 2 km from one another. Yet these amended conditions would not be applicable to photovoltaic plants located in agricultural areas which obtained a DIA authorisation prior to the entry into force of the Romani Decree (i.e., 29 March 2011) on condition that the plants came into operation within one year from its entry into force (i.e., 29 March 2012) (Article 10(6)).578\n\nSee also Article 10(5) providing that the conditions of Article 10(4) would not apply to land abandoned for at least 5 years.\n\n334.\n\nFinally, Article 25(10) of the Romani Decree contemplated the adoption of a Ministerial Decree that would elaborate on the feed-in tariffs scheme applicable to photovoltaic plants not covered by the Third Energy Account, namely plants that commenced operation subsequent to 31 May 2011. The Romani Decree set specific principles according to which the Ministerial Decree had to be enacted, namely: introduction of an annual maximum limit of cumulative electric power generated by photovoltaic plants that could benefit from feed-in tariffs; determination of feed-intariffs considering the decreasing cost of the plants on the one hand and the incentive schemes employed by other EU Member States on the other hand; and application of requirements qualifying persons to benefit from the feed-in tariffs.579\n\nRomani Decree, Exhibit CL-51, Article 25(10); *Decreto Legislativo 29 dicembre 2003, n. 387* (Legislative Decree 29 December 2003, No. 387), Exhibit CL-50, Article 7.\n\n335.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the Fourth Energy Account was adopted by Ministerial Decree of 5 May 2011.580 The Fourth Energy Account applied to photovoltaic plants that were connected to the grid between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2016, for an indicative target of installed power at the national level of about 23,000 MW, corresponding to an indicative annual cumulative cost of incentives estimated to be between EUR 6 and 7 billion (Article 1(2)).\n\nFourth Energy Account, Exhibit CL-56. On 19 April 2011, the Italian Government had made public a draft Decree setting out key components of the forthcoming Fourth Energy Account. See Minister of Economic Development, Draft Fourth Energy Account Decree, 19 April 2011, Exhibit C-179.\n\n336.\n\nThe Fourth Energy Account qualified large plants as plants not falling under the category of small plants, the latter being photovoltaic plants with capacity up to 1 MW installed on buildings; other photovoltaic plants with capacity up to 200 KW operating under net metering *('scambio sul post o'*) and photovoltaic plants of any capacity installed on buildings and areas owned by the public administration (Article 3(1)(u) and (v)). Under Article 4(2), for the period from 1 June 2011 until 31 December 2012, incentives available to large plants would be limited to specific amounts (Article 4(2)). Photovoltaic plants would receive the feed-in tariff in force on the date of their entry into operation (Article 6(4)) which would apply for 20 years (Article 12(2)).\n\n337.\n\nThe Fourth Energy Account also adopted Article 10(4) of the Romani Decree with regard to the eligibility for feed-in tariffs of photovoltaic plants installed in agricultural areas (Article 11(2)(e)). Furthermore, Article 12(5) of the Fourth Energy Account provided that:\n\nFor the purposes of the allocation of feed-in tariffs, several photovoltaic plants belonging, or attributable to, the same responsible entity and located either within the same or within contiguous cadastral parcels of land shall be considered a single plant of a capacity equal to the cumulative capacity of the individual plants....\n\nThe \u2018responsible entity\u2019 was defined as the entity in charge of the plant\u2019s operation and maintenance, which was entitled to request and access feed-in tariffs and to apply for inclusion in the GSE register (Article 3(1)(s)).\n\n338.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \u2018[t]he Romani Decree was so drastic that it led to an outcry on the Italian market\u2019,581 and that it was in effect a paradigm of the legal instability at which Article 10(1) of the ECT is directed: \u2018it was the legislation that led to the loss of the project.\u2019582\n\nTranscript, Day 6, 25:6-7 (Dufetre).\n\nTranscript, Day 6, 33:21-22 (Legum).\n\n339.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Romani Decree was an implementation by Italy of EU Directive 2009/28/EC, aimed at achieving the objective of a share of at least 20% of energy from renewable sources on gross final consumption of energy in the EU; its timing was due both to the implementation deadline of the Directive and to the rapid progress being made (with associated expense) in achieving the targets set for the Third Energy Account.583 According to Italy, its aim with the adoption of this measure was \u2018to reconcile the development of renewable energy with the protection of the environment, territory and landscape\u2019 and to combine it \u2018with the need to gradually reduce the expansive investment trend in photovoltaic, in order to meet the quantitative targets envisaged under the EU scheme.\u2019584\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 159-162.\n\nIbid., para. 408.\n\n340.\n\nOne major aim of the legislation was to impose a cumulative cap on incentives, in view of their success in attracting investment. The corollary was a reduction in feed-in tariffs, which for the Puglia Project would have been in the order of 13%,585 a reduction which, while not drastic, was capable of having a serious effect on the economics of the Project.\n\nTranscript, Day 6, 28:16-22 (Legum).\n\n341.\n\nThe changes concerning agricultural land - in particular the change from a 50% land ratio allowance for photovoltaic plants to a 10% allowance - had a particular impact on investors, such as the Claimants, who had already acquired the land and who found themselves in the position of having to acquire much more land to support the same size of plant. \u2018The effect... was that for projects like that of the Claimants, where the land was acquired and there was room only for there to be 50% of the plot taken up by the plants, it simply wasn\u2019t viable to go forward...\u2019586\n\nTranscript, Day 6, 33:6-10 (Legum).\n\n342.\n\nIn applying to the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account the standard of legal stability incorporated in Article 10(1), first and second sentence, of the ECT (paragraph 319 above), the Tribunal would make the following points:\n\n(a) The reduction in FITs was quite substantial, but was not in itself crippling or disabling. Moreover, it was a response to a genuine fiscal need, given the large take-up under the earlier Energy Accounts.\n\n(b) The reduction in incentives was proportionately less than the reduction in the cost of photovoltaic technology during 2010, and left Italian subsidy levels higher than those in Germany, France and Spain.587\n\n(c) The principle of guaranteed tariffs for a 20-year period was maintained.\n\n(d) So too was the criterion for qualification for FITs, viz., connection to the grid.\n\n(e) The grace period for grid connection to preserve the pre-existing tariff level, viz., 12 months, was reasonable.\n\n(f) The Fourth Energy Account, applying to photovoltaic plants connected to the grid between 1 June 2011 and 31 December 2016, made some allowance for projects that could not meet the cut-off of 12 months.\n\n(g) Leaving aside questions of administration (dealt with below), the provision for a register of large plants eligible for feed-in tariffs contributed to legal security.\n\n(h) The limits on the use of agricultural land were motivated by valid rural planning concerns, although their specific impact on the Puglia Project is a matter to which the Tribunal will return (see paragraphs 403-408).\n\nOverview of EU support policies and PV costs production trend, Undated, Exhibit R-3.\n\n343.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal concludes that the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account, taken overall, were not disproportionate, did not violate specific commitments made to the promotors of PV plants, and did not breach Article 10(1), first sentence, of the ECT.\n\n(c) The publication of the GSE lists of large plants\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nAs noted, the Fourth Energy Account established a register of large plants eligible for feed-in tariffs *(\u2018registro dei grandi impianti\u2019)* which would be administered by the GSE (Article 8(1)). The GSE published technical regulations588 for the enrolment of large plants to the register (Article 8(9)). The deadline for the submission of enrolment requests to the GSE register for purposes of eligibility for feed-in tariffs in 2011 was 30 June 2011 (Article 8(2)).589 The GSE was required to publish the list and ranking of photovoltaic plants admitted to the register within 15 days of the enrolment application deadline (Article 8(3)).590\n\nGSE, \u2018Technical Regulations for the registration of large photovoltaic plants, pursuant to Ministerial Decree of 5 May 2011\u2019, rev. 1, July 2011, Exhibit CL-64.\n\nSee also Ibid., p. 12, Table 2.\n\nSee also Ibid., p. 19.\n\n345.\n\nUnder Article 6(2), large plants that came into operation by 31 August 2011 were automatically eligible for feed-in tariffs. Large plants that entered into operation between 1 September 2011 and 31 December 2012 had to be listed in the register and would benefit from feed-in tariffs provided that their ranking on the register so allowed and that their certificate of work completion was sent to the GSE within seven months (or nine months for plants with electric power capacity above 1 MW) from the date of publication of the ranking (Article 6(3) and 8(4)).591\n\nSee also Ibid., p. 12.\n\n346.\n\nThe GSE established the ranking of the plants listed in the register according to the following priority criteria:\n\na) the date of entry into operation, which had to be prior to the date of application to the GSE register;\n\nb) the date of completion of construction works, which had to be prior to the date of application to the GSE register;\n\nc) the precedence of the date of issuance of authorisations;\n\nd) the lower capacity of the plants;\n\ne) the precedence of the date of application for enrolment to the GSE registry (Article 8(3)).\n\n347.\n\nOn 15 July 2011, the GSE published a list ranking the photovoltaic plants eligible for feed-in tariffs under the Fourth Energy Account.592 The GSE list included 115 of the 120 photovoltaic plants of the Claimants\u2019 Project. On 29 July 2011, the GSE published an amended list which included 113 of the 120 photovoltaic plants of the Claimants\u2019 Project.593 The amended list contained a note that inclusion of a plant in the list did not guarantee its access to incentives unless the GSE verified its compliance with all conditions following the commencement of the plant\u2019s operations. This can be taken as a representation, albeit conditional, as to qualification for incentives.\n\nGSE, \u2018Ranking of plants included within the Register whose status allows satisfaction of cost limits established for the 1 June 2011 - 31 December 2011 period pursuant to the Ministerial Decree of 5.5.2001 [sic] (Registrations occurring from 20 May 2011 to 30 June 2011)\u2019, 15 July 2011, Exhibit C-191.\n\nGSE, \u2018List of plants included within the Register whose status allows for the satisfaction of the cost limits established for the 1 June 2011-31 December 2011 period pursuant to the Ministerial Decree of 5.5.2011\u2019, 29 July 2011, Exhibit C-195.\n\n348.\n\nArticle 8(5) of the Fourth Energy Account provided for the removal from the GSE list of listed plants that commenced their operations by 31 August 2011,594 As some plants were removed from the GSE list pursuant to this provision, the GSE published an updated third list on 12 August 2011595 and a fourth and final list on 16 September 201 1.596 Again, 113 of the 120 photovoltaic plants of the Claimants\u2019 Project were included in the GSE final list of 16 September 2011.\n\nSee also Article 6(2) of Fourth Energy Account, Exhibit CL-56.\n\nGSE, \u2018List of plants included within the Register whose status allows for the satisfaction of the cost limits established for the 1 June 2011-31 December 2011 period pursuant to the Ministerial Decree of 5 May 2011 - Updated on 12 August 2011\u2019, 12 August 2011, Exhibit C-196.\n\nGSE, \u2018List of plants included within the Register whose status allows for the satisfaction of the cost limits established for the 1 June 2011 - 31 December 2011 period pursuant to the Ministerial Decree of 5.5.2001 -Updated on 16 September 2011\u2019, 16 September 2011, Exhibit C-200.\n\n349.\n\nThe Claimants argue that:\n\nOne of the main innovations of the Fourth Energy Account was the creation of a register of plants eligible for feed-in tariffs, administered by the GSE, and based on a ranking system. As noted in the Memorial, no investor would invest before it was confirmed that the project\u2019s plants were included in the register and therefore eligible for feed-in tariffs. As also explained in the Memorial, the GSE published a series of lists of eligible plants between July and September 2011. The GSE\u2019s withdrawal of a list infected with errors and publication of multiple additional lists gave rise to confusion and consternation on the Italian solar market. It was only with the publication of the final list that investors had certainty on which plants were eligible.597\n\nReply, para. 244. Also, Transcript, Day 5, 88:3-20 (Bander).\n\n350.\n\nAt the time, the Claimants welcomed the GSE listing procedure as providing certainty,598 although certainty was not in fact achieved for some time. But almost all the Claimants\u2019 plants were included on all the lists,599 and given the other difficulties Blusun was experiencing in obtaining finance and completing the Project in the now shorter time-scale, the Tribunal has doubts as to the deterrent effect of the delay. It will return to this issue in its discussion of causation, but for present purposes it is sufficient to hold that Italy acted in good faith in the difficult task of compiling a full list, given the rapidly changing construction scene, and that in doing so it did not breach any applicable standards of due diligence.\n\nTranscript, Day 1,49:10-17 (Legum). The Claimants do not make specific complaint as to the small number of omissions of their proposed plants, which the Respondent attributes to deficiencies in the forms submitted: Transcript, Day 1 50:3-23 (Legum) and 148:10-17 (Malaguti).\n\nTranscript, Day 5, 86:23 - 88:5 (Barrier).\n\n(d) The Brindisi stop-work order\n--------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the stop-work order was the final blow to the Project, preventing the construction even of the two projected plants by the deadline laid down in the Fourth Energy Account and thereby ensuring the bankruptcy of the project companies.\n\n352.\n\nOn 17 November 2011, the environmental protection unit of the local police inspected a construction site of the Claimants\u2019 Project and requested the relevant DIA authorisations. On 21 November 2011, the police communicated its inspection observations to the local prosecutor and the Municipality of Brindisi.600 According to the police observations, no construction works of photovoltaic plants, or even construction of the surrounding fence, took place by the Claimants, contrary to what was stated in three letters of 1 March 2010 notifying the commencement of works.601 Furthermore, the policy stated that the Claimants\u2019 plants were contiguous and were associated to a single developer, namely Eskosol, the owner of the local development companies holding the DIA authorisations for the two plants under construction at the time.\n\nOrder of the Carabinieri for the Protection of the Environment, 21 November 2011, Exhibit C-204.\n\nIbid.; Commencement Notice of 1 March 2010, Exhibit R-17.\n\n353.\n\nOn 2 December 2011, the local prosecutor notified the Municipality of Brindisi that the situation as has been observed by the police constituted a criminal offense violating zoning regulations.602 The local prosecutor was of the opinion that:\n\n... the intent of the owners of this business project was to proceed with an artificial division of several plants in order to circumvent the procedure for the issuance of a construction permit by the region.603\n\nThe local prosecutor referred to Italian case law according to which:\n\nIn the construction industry, in the event that an operation performed on the basis of a declaration of the initiation of activity (DIA) would not be legally permissible under the legal framework, because it fails to fulfil its requirements, the works shall be considered as abusive and constitute an offence as set forth in art. 44, b) D.P.R. n. 380 of 2001, given the inefficacy of the presented DIA and the eventual expiration of the time limit for the P.A. to adopt injunctive measures.604\n\nThe local prosecutor further relied upon Circular Note 1/2008 on the mode of calculation of the electric power capacity of plants belonging to a single owner or a unitary industrial project.\n\nLetter of the Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office to the Tribunal of Brindisi, 2 December 2011, Exhibit C-206, p. 1 (citation omitted).\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n354.\n\nOn 19 December 2011, in response to the local prosecutor\u2019s letter, the Municipality of Brindisi launched self-redress proceedings *(\u2018autoiutela\u2019)* with the view to reviewing DIA authorisations obtained for the construction of the Claimants\u2019 Project.605 As required by the applicable law, the Municipality of Brindisi requested interested parties to submit written memoranda or other material that would provide clarification on the police findings.606\n\nLetter of the Municipality of Brindisi to Gamma Service, Aurora Energia, Dada Project and Eskosol, 19 December 2011, Exhibit C-208.\n\nIbid. See also Letter of 11 January 2012, Exhibit R-18.\n\n355.\n\nOn 11 January 2012, the Municipality of Brindisi issued a stop-work order *(\u2018inibizione dell\u2019attivita edilizia\u2019)* preventing the progress of works on a few of the photovoltaic plants of the Claimants\u2019 Project and questioning the validity of the DIA authorisations acquired.607 Eskosol suspended the construction works and challenged the municipal order before the competent Administrative Court.\n\nMunicipality of Brindisi, \u2018Decision of suspension of the activity undertaken as a result of the declaration of the initiation of activity (DIA), Prot. N. 87155 of 23 December 2008, 11 January 2012\u2019, Exhibit C-211.\n\n356.\n\nOn 13 January 2012, the Regional Administrative Court of Puglia - Lecce as a precautionary measure suspended the stop-work order issued by the Municipality of Brindisi.608 On 7 March 2012, the Regional Administrative Court annulled for excess of power the decisions of the municipality of Brindisi to initiate self-redress proceedings and to issue a stop-work order. The tribunal held that Regional Law 31/1998 \u2018sets the conditions stated at the time of the submission of the application or to the previous two years, so that there is no reference in the law regarding the need for the requirement to subsist afterwards\u2019, and noted that the transfer from the SPV to Eskosol took place after the DIA application. It further held that the Municipality\u2019s order \u2018is not expressly related to\u2019 the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of 26 March 2010, \u2018so that the specific situation cannot receive the qualification of \"consolidated\" and is therefore outside of the ambit of the legal regime created by\u2019 that decision.609 The Municipality of Brindisi did not appeal.\n\n*TAR Puglia, 14 gennaio 2012, nos. 37, 38, 39, 40* (Regional Administrative Court of Puglia, 14 January 2012, Nos. 37, 38, 39, 40, 13 January 2012 (filed at the secretariat on 14 January 2012)), Exhibit RL-10.\n\n*TAR Puglia, 7 marzo 2012, n. 50* (Regional Administrative Court of Puglia, 7 March 2012, No. 50), Exhibit CL-82.\n\n357.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the stop-work order was the \u2018final blow to the project.\u2019610 Its rather rapid suspension by the Regional Administrative Court was irrelevant, given the penalties that could have been imposed had the Municipality\u2019s position been upheld by the Court on the merits.611 By the time the final decision was taken it was too late to meet the shortened deadline for connection laid down in the Fourth Energy Plan.\n\nReply, para. 231.\n\nTranscript, Day 2, 80:4-12 (Lecorcier).\n\n358.\n\nOnce again, two separate issues are raised: did the episode involve a breach of the ECT, and what was its effect on the failure of the Project? Only the former question is considered here.612\n\nFor the issue of causation see below, paragraphs 375-394.\n\n359.\n\nThere is a certain similarity between the stop-work episode and the takeover of a failing industrial plant by the Mayor of Palermo in the *ELSI* case.613 At issue in both cases was the implications for the fair and equitable treatment standard of a municipal intervention subsequently held municipally unlawful. In both cases the intervention seems to have triggered insolvency and was held to have been *ultra vires* under Italian law. But that is where the similarity ends. There is a marked difference between the requisitioning of a plant for 6 months and a short-term stop-work order. It was not apparent on what legal basis the Mayor of Palermo intervened to requisition a factory, whereas the Municipality of Brindisi set out a coherent concern about the legality of the works, albeit not one which the Regional Administrative Court was willing to accept. Above all, the Claimants were able to challenge the stop-work order, obtain immediate interim relief and get a final decision in less than two months. By contrast, ELSI\u2019s administrative appeal to the Prefect of Palermo took 17 months to be decided. Yet the Chamber held there had been no breach of the FCN treaty in the *ELSI* case.\n\n*Elellronica Sicula S.P.A. (ELSI) (United States of America* v. *Italy),* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1989, p. 15.\n\n360.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the stop-work episode did not involve any beach of the ECT. Nor (for that matter) was it a function of \u2018legal instability.\u2019 The order was temporary in effect, was legally motivated, and was dealt with by due process of law and with reasonable promptness. It was not arbitrary or discriminatory, but fell well within the range of legal risk of an industrial enterprise, in particular one based on debatable regulatory grounds (see above, paragraph 268).\n\n(e) Cumulative effect of the various episodes\n---------------------------------------------\n\n361.\n\nFaced with an itemized analysis of the various episodes, the Claimants argue that it is a mistake to look at them separately: it is their cumulative effect in causing the failure of the Project that matters.614 They cite in support the following passage from *El Paso* v. *Argentina:*\n\nAlthough they may be seen in isolation as reasonable measures to cope with a difficult economic situation, the measures examined can be viewed as cumulative steps which individually do not qualify as violations of FET, as pointed out earlier by the Tribunal, but which amount to a violation if their cumulative effect is considered. It is quite possible to hold that Argentina could pesify, put a cap on the Spot Price, etc., but that a combination of all these measures completely altered the overall framework.615\n\nIn *El Paso,* the tribunal even defined the collection of acts which led to a forced sale of the investor\u2019s Argentine shareholdings as a \u2018composite breach\u2019 in the sense of Article 15 of the ILC Articles.616 But for the purposes of that case it was not necessary to go so far. Article 15 only applies to a breach \u2018through a series of acts or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful\u2019 - for example, genocide.617 The first two sentences of ECT Article 10(1) do not define an aggregate of acts as wrongful in the way that Article 1 of the Genocide Convention does.\n\nSee Reply, paras. 230-232.\n\n*El Paso Energy International Co* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, Exhibit CL-109, para. 515  ***(El Paso v. Argentina).***\n\nIbid., para. 516, citing *Societe Genet ale* v. *Dominican Republic,* LCIA Case No. UN7927, Award on Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction, 19 September 2008, para, 91.\n\nSee Crawford, *State Responsibility. The General Part* (2013) 265-269.\n\n362.\n\nA breach of an obligation to \u2018encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors\u2019 including \u2018to accord at all times... fair and equitable treatment\u2019 could be breached by a single transformative act aimed at an investment, or by a program of more minor measures, or by a series of measures taken without plan or coordination but having the prohibited effect.\n\n363.\n\nBut the fair and equitable treatment standard which, by virtue of the second sentence, is at the core of the obligation of stability under the first sentence has a relatively high threshold. The *El Paso* tribunal spoke of \u2018a total alteration of the entire legal setup for foreign investments\u2019, and added that \u2018all the different elements and guarantees just mentioned can be analysed as a special commitment of Argentina that such a total alteration would not take place.\u2019618 The tribunal in *LG&E* spoke of \u2018completely dismantling the very legal framework constructed to attract investors.\u2019619 The emphasis is on the subversion of the legal regime.\n\n*El Paso* v. *Argentina,* Exhibit CL-109, para. 517.\n\n*LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, Exhibit CL-30, para. 139.\n\n364.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the various acts complained of here do not reach, or breach, this standard in aggregate any more than they do individually. The Constitutional Court proceedings pre-existed the investment and recourse to the Court was itself an integral part of the Italian legal framework, as was the eventual lack of impact of its adverse decision on consolidated relationships. The stop-work order - the only measure taken specifically in relation to the Project - was granted and revoked in a timely manner and in accordance with rule of law standards. Admittedly the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account made substantial changes to the regime of incentives, but they did not abolish incentives for which plant operators had already qualified, and they gave a reasonable period of time (12 months) for prospective operators to qualify (see paragraph 342). With respect to these measures, the case for breach of the stability undertaking in ECT Article 10(1), first sentence, is not materially stronger when the measures are taken in aggregate than separately.\n\nB. Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: ECT Article 10(1), second sentence (legitimate expectations)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n365.\n\nThe Claimants present an alternative formulation of an Article 10(1) claim based essentially on legitimate expectations.620 In effect it is argued that persons in the Claimants\u2019 position had a legitimate expectation that the Third Energy Account would be maintained for the term envisaged:\n\nthe Claimants had legitimate expectations that the Third Energy Account would remain in place for its entire duration according to its terms; that is, until the end of 2013. However, the Romani Decree frustrated the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations in this respect.621\n\nThis argument has the effect of treating the law as not a general command but an individual commitment, at least where the law is enacted for the benefit of a determinate class of persons.\n\nSee Reply, paras. 217, 298-319.\n\nTranscript Day 5, 71:12-17 (Dufetre).\n\n366.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 argument raises several issues. The first is its relationship to their avowed main claim of legislative instability based on ECT Article 10(1), first sentence. Evidently if there were \u2018legitimate expectations that the Third Energy Account would remain in place for its entire duration according to its terms\u2019, issues of reasonableness, proportionality and foreseeableness of changes to that Account would not arise: the Romani Decree was a transparent breach of any such expectations. The Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations argument is thus a frank alternative to its more nuanced argument based on degree of legislative change.\n\n367.\n\nAs such, it faces the second and more fundamental difficulty, which is that tribunals have so far declined to sanctify laws as promises. For example, as noted already (above, paragraph 317), the tribunal in *Charanne* was clear:\n\nunder international law... in the absence of a specific commitment toward stability, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation that a regulatory framework such as that at issue in this arbitration is to not be modified at any time to adapt to the needs of the market and to the public interest.622\n\n*Charanne v. Spain,* Exhibit CL-208, para. 510.\n\n368.\n\nThe *El Paso* tribunal made a similar distinction, as follows:\n\nUnder a FET clause, a foreign investor can expect that the rules will not be changed without justification of an economic, social or other nature. Conversely, it is unthinkable that a State could make a general commitment to all foreign investors never to change its legislation whatever the circumstances, and it would be unreasonable for an investor to rely on such a freeze.623\n\n*-\u2019* *El Paso* v. *Argentina,* Exhibit CL-109, para. 372.\n\n369.\n\nAs stated by the tribunal in *Philip Morris* v. *Uruguay.* \n\nIt clearly emerges from the analysis of the FET standard by investment tribunals that legitimate expectations depend on *specific* undertakings and representations made by the host State to induce investors to make an investment. Provisions of *general* legislation applicable to a plurality of persons or of category of persons, do not create legitimate expectations that there will be no change in the law.624\n\n*Philip Morris SARL* v. *Oriental Republic of Uruguay,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/7, Award, 8 July 2016, para. 426.\n\n370.\n\nCounsel for the Claimants took exception to this:\n\nthe language [in *Charanne]* that seems to suggest that an investor can't base a legitimate expectation on a provision of law is unfathomable, because the law is the most formal statement on which any investor can base an expectation. How can it possibly be that some kind of representation made informally to an investor is more significant in terms of international law analysis than a representation that is made in the form of a law?625\n\nTranscript, Day 5, 109:25 - 110:8 (Legum).\n\n371.\n\nIt is true that informal representations can present difficulties, which is why tribunals have increasingly insisted on clarity and the appropriate authority to give undertakings binding on the state. It is also true that a representation as to future conduct of the state could be made in the form of a law, sufficiently clearly expressed. But there is still a clear distinction between a law, i.e. a norm of greater or lesser generality creating rights and obligations while it remains in force, and a promise or contractual commitment. There is a further distinction between contractual commitments and expectations underlying a given relationship: however legitimate, the latter are more matters to be taken into account in applying other norms than they are norms in their own right. International law does not make binding that which was not binding in the first place, nor render perpetual what was temporary only. In the present case, the expectations are even less powerful because European law had already lowered them: it was clear that the incentives offered were subject to modification in light, *inter alia,* of changing costs and improved technology.\n\n372.\n\nIn the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant subsidies such as feed-in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged once granted. But if they are lawfully granted, and if it becomes necessary to modify them, this should be done in a manner which is not disproportionate to the aim of the legislative amendment, and should have due regard to the reasonable reliance interests of recipients who may have committed substantial resources on the basis of the earlier regime. These considerations apply even more strongly when the context is subsidies or the payment of special benefits for particular economic sectors.\n\n373.\n\nMr. Marino, Claimants\u2019 witness as to the viability of the Project, argued that:\n\nThe Claimants, when they entered the Italian market, had reasonable expectations to find a stable regulatory environment. Actually at the time one energy account, the First Energy Account, had come to its natural end in 2007, and the Second Energy Account was going to its natural end in 2010. So there was no reason to believe that an incentive system for PVs would have come to termination before the date originally planned.626\n\nBut a reasonable market expectation as to some state of affairs, justified or not, is not a basis for shifting risks to the public sector, i.e. the state budget. Circumstances change and in the absence of specific commitments, the risk of change is for entrepreneurs to assess and assume.\n\nTranscript, Day 3, 3:19 \u2014 4:1 (Marino).\n\n374.\n\nTo conclude, the Respondent made no special commitment to the Claimants with respect to the extension and operation of FITs, nor did it specifically undertake that relevant Italian laws would remain unchanged. For these reasons the Claimants have not established a breach of Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT.\n\nC. The Issue of Causation in relation to ECT Article 10(1)\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n375.\n\nCentral to the Claimants\u2019 case as pleaded under Article 10(1) is a claim of fact - viz., that the real reason for the complete failure of the Project was the legal instability in Italy arising from a series of events, commencing on 26 March 2010 with the decision of the Constitutional Court and culminating in January 2012 with the Municipality\u2019s intervention. The Claimants do not suggest that these events were linked or that the sequence was the result of any design on the part of the Italian State - quite the reverse. This was no conspiracy but a series of disconnected acts of alleged disregard for their rights and for the effective commitments made to investors through the various Energy Accounts. But even if all (or some of them) constituted breaches of the ECT, if they did not cause the failure of the Project, the Claimants cannot recover.627\n\nFor the requirement of causation as a condition for a claim of breach of an obligation, see ILC Articles on State Responsibility, 2001, Exhibit CL-4, Art. 31 and commentary.\n\n376.\n\nCertain features of the Project are barely or not at all in dispute:\n\n(a) It was conceived as an integrated project, linking up to 124 small solar plants together in what would have been, at the time, the largest solar park in Europe.\n\n(b) It relied heavily on the DIA procedure, as made applicable to units with capacity between 20 KW and 1 MW by Puglia Regional Laws 1/2008 and 31/2008. In other words, the legality of the Project from a planning point of view depended on individual approval (under the DIA procedure, deemed approval) of small plants of less than 1 MW. Rut its economic viability depended on the cumulation of those plants into a large aggregated array of up to 124 MW.628 Without being aggregated, few if any of the plants could have been individually connected to the grid; their connection depended on their being linked to the two sub-stations by a large regional network, whose construction Blusun funded, and funded in advance.\n\n(c) For Blusun itself to arrange the construction of the rings and sub-stations and their connection to the high-voltage grid was also apparently novel. Earlier projects had been connected by ENEL, the national operator, but this was time-consuming and would itself probably have defeated the plan.\n\n(d) The land was acquired and paid for by the project companies (and thus by Eskosol) at above-market price for agricultural land.629 In other words, it was acquired on the assumption that the Project would succeed with full fiscal incentives. Yet that was not clear at the time Blusun committed to the Project, in November 2009.\n\n(e) The Project never obtained the substantial financing required.\n\n(f) No solar panels were ever installed or *(a fortiori)* connected.\n\n(g) Work on two plants was commenced, but ceased immediately after the intervention of the Commune and, despite the prompt lifting of the communal ban, was never resumed. Even if completed, these few plants could not have prevented the collapse of the Project.\n\nAs admitted by one of the Claimants in evidence: you are in the middle of the countryside;... So if you don\u2019t have the infrastructure for this 120 times 1-megawatt plants, it makes no sense. Transcript Day 2, 119:5-8 (Stein).\n\nMemorial, para. 203.\n\n377.\n\nIt is helpful to consider three of these elements in more detail.\n\n1. The status of the DIAs and the Project as a unified scheme\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nThe key to the commercial success of the Puglia Project was its capacity to function as a unified scheme, attracting FITs for a potential of almost 120 MW while taking advantage of a DIA procedure designed for individual small plants.\n\n379.\n\nThe Claimants relied on the DIAs as amounting to a definitive authorisation for the individual plants. They refer by way of example to a Notice of the Municipality of Mesagne with the notation \u2018The local development companies obtain the 53d DIA Certificate of Conformity, stating that the construction of the given solar plants was in accordance with the relevant regulations.\u2019630 In fact the Notice states in its operative clause that the DIA procedure \u2018is to be regarded as complete\u2019,631 which is not at all the same thing.\n\nReply, p. 173.\n\nNotice of 21 January 2010, Exhibit C-24.\n\n380.\n\nAt no stage did the Claimants obtain unconditional assurances from the central Government as to their plants\u2019 entitlement to FITs, or to the level of such FITs. Even if the lists issued by GSE in various versions in July-September 2011 could be considered as conditional assurances, they were subject to compliance with applicable terms and conditions, to be assessed as at the date of connection to the grid. Until then they were contingent.\n\n381.\n\nOf particular significance was section 31 of Regional Law 31/2008, which provided as follows:\n\nPlants installed on the ground in an agricultural area which consists of lands belonging to the same owner, or which is made up of several plots resulting from the splitting of an area of greater extension carried out within the two years prior to the application, are considered as a single plant for the purposes of calculating the maximum electric power for having recourse to the DIA procedure.632\n\nRegional Law 31/2008, Exhibit CL-72, Article 3(1)(b).\n\n382.\n\nReferring to this provision, the Watson, Farley and Williams Preliminary Due Diligence Report of 27 January 2010 recommended that \u2018an exhaustive investigation shall be earned out in order to ascertain that the relevant Regional Law has not been breached by the plants developed by Nico Energia.\u2019\n\n383.\n\nThe Claimants emphasise the due diligence done on the Project, in particular through the Preliminary Due Diligence Report. They go on to assert that \u2018[t]he report identified no particular issue with respect either to the construction and connection authorizations held by the companies...633 But this is not the case: the Preliminary Report focuses perhaps more on this potential problem than any other. Moreover, a due diligence exercise (and this one was avowedly incomplete) is or should be carried out for the client prior to the investment; it does not shift any risk to the state. Nor could it form the basis for a legitimate expectation vis-a-vis the state that the DIA \u2018authorizations\u2019 were secure against challenge.\n\nMemorial, para. 196.\n\n384.\n\nIn fact, the \u2018exhaustive investigation\u2019 called for by the Preliminary Due Diligence Report was not finalised until May 2011. It took the form of a careful but not definitive opinion on Italian law by a member of the same firm.634 It concluded, for example, that the use of the 12 SPVs in the DIA process \u2018does reduce the risk of such plants being found as belonging or attributable to the same responsible entity\u2019, thereby acknowledging that the risk existed.635 Its overall conclusion was that \u2018the risk of the DIAs being successfully challenged may be regarded as remote.\u2019636\n\nOpinion of Eugenio Tranchino, of Watson, Farley and Williams, 20 May 2011, Exhibit C-357. This document was submitted late, by permission of the Tribunal (see paragraph 22 above).\n\nIbid., para. 5.2.\n\nIbid., para. 4.7.\n\n385.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, that conclusion (unsupported by any positive representations made by competent authorities of the Respondent state) significantly under-estimated the level of risk. There were repeated regulatory warnings in the documentation against aggregation of DIA-authorized small plants,637 but the economies of scale of the Puglia Project were entirely dependent on aggregation, and the Project was for most of its \u2018life\u2019 conceived and financed as a whole.638\n\nE.g., DIA Certificates of Expiry, 3 November 2008 - 26 June 2009, Exhibit C-19.\n\nE.g., Letter from L. Dante to ESCO, attaching Memorandum of Understanding between Oikonomia and ESCO, 27 November 2009, Exhibit C-54, Oikonomia\u2019s receipt to Esko for down-payment of \u20ac758,000 for \u2018the 120 MW green power rights.\u2019\n\n386.\n\nTo conclude, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Project ran a significant risk of incurring legal or administrative difficulties, even if these could be (and in the event largely were) overcome. Its success was by no means certain.639\n\nIn this context, it is relevant to note the Parties\u2019 extensive debate about other comparable PV schemes in Italy. The Respondent stressed that many PV plants qualified for FITs, including some large ones. Challenged to give examples comparable to the Puglia project, the Respondent\u2019s witness gave as prime example the \u2018Blasi-Casignano project\u2019: Witness Statement of Daniele Bacchiocchi, pp. 4, 8-11; Transcript, Day 2, 143:7-11 (Bacciocchi). This was a smaller but still substantial linkage of 71 separately owned plants connected before December 2010 (i.e. under the Third Energy Account). From the Tribunal\u2019s viewpoint, what is most relevant about this scheme was that it too was the subject of criminal proceedings, emphasizing the element of regulatory risk in projects whether under Regional Law 1/2008 or Regional Law 31/2008.\n\n2. The failure to obtain project financing\n------------------------------------------\n\n387.\n\nAs has been seen, the Puglia Project depended for its success on substantial and timely project financing which it never obtained. On the Claimants\u2019 own admission, this was the proximate cause of the Project\u2019s failure (see paragraph 310 above).\n\n388.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the documentary evidence produced by the Claimants does not reveal anything more than a reluctance by sometimes marginal sources to commit the necessary funds.\n\n389.\n\nA revealing document in this regard is an e-mail of 21 January 2011 from HSBC, Blusun\u2019s financial adviser, to Mr. Stein. Headed \u2018Eskosol banks project financing\u2019, it reviews the state of financial negotiations with 16 potential sources.640 It is relatively upbeat and is full of statements such as \u2018Interested in the project. To contact to discuss new strategy\u2019 - a statement which, concerning as it did a major bank, might have given pause for thought, since it implies the lack of success of the existing strategy. What is perhaps more significant, however, is that of six indications given of reasons not to provide finance, only one expressly mentions \u2018political risk concerns\u2019, one mentions withholding tax issues, and four specifically mention uncertainties about DIA authorisation. Replete with references to \u2018appetite\u2019, the document conveys a distinct lack of recent appetite to finance the Project. And so it proved.641\n\nEmail chain between HSBC and M. Stein, 21 January 2011, Exhibit C-159; another 7 financiers, mostly banks, are mentioned as \u2018without concrete follow up.\u2019\n\nA later e-mail from HSBC relating to another source (Exhibit C-164, 3 March 2011) states \u2018unfortunately it seems they are a cold on the Eskosol project from an authorization standpoint and also due to the current potentially adverse regulatory trend / uncertainty.\u2019 This refers to both authorisation and regulatory uncertainty, but in that order.\n\n390.\n\nOn 28 February 2011, Eskosol failed to make the 20% down payment for the first tranche of panels and on 7 March 2011, Siemens suspended performance of the EPC contract, which was never reinstated (see paragraph 101 above). Eskosol\u2019s failure to pay *predated* the Romani Decree of 3 March 2011.\n\n3. The evidence underlying the \u2018legal stability\u2019 claim\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nIt is a paradox of the \u2018legal stability\u2019 claim that with the (brief) exception of the stop-work order, the Respondent never denied the legality of the Puglia Project at the time, or the potential availability of FITs once the plants forming the Project were connected and started generating. Moreover, as the Respondent repeatedly pointed out, many other PV plants did manage to get connected at the time, and to benefit from the still relatively generous level of FITs.642\n\nE.g., Transcript, Day 1, 110:18-111:2 (Malaguti); 128:13- 129:1 (Fiorentino); 142:3-6 (Grasso).\n\n392.\n\nThe Claimants repeatedly invoke reactions of \u2018the market\u2019 in general, or particular customers, in support of their claim. In fact, the evidence before the Tribunal of market reactions and their relation to the issue of causation is at best equivocal. This issue was briefly reviewed in paragraph 389 above in the crucial context of financing. Other evidence is to similar effect:\n\n\u2022 An e-mail from Blusun to another potential funder stated:\n\nWe are speaking about 120 x 1 MW projects under a unified Dia authorization (not attached to the actual Dia discussion), because of the start of the work of our substation and the local grid.\n\nIt received the following immediate reply:\n\nAt this point we are only focused on AU projects given the uncertainty around the legal status of the DIA procedure. But I appreciate the heads up, and will be sure to let you know if our view changes.643\n\n\u2022 Another similar exchange included the following passage:\n\nRegarding the Validity of the DIA, according to our news, DIA Projects are only safe if projects are connected to the grid before January 16th. Otherwise there is a risk that projects could be challenged within 120 days from the end of the works. In principle because of this issues [sic] we are not interested in this opportunity unless there is a way to structure our entrance not taking any DIA nor financing risk.644\n\nBut the Puglia Project combined precisely DIA and financing risk, both on a large scale.\n\n\u2022 Still earlier was the following exchange:\n\nMichael Stein wrote:\n\nPlease find following some additional value of our project which difference our project to \u2018normal\u2019 DIA projects:\n\n- Conception of cluster site (2 FIT for a project of 120 MW !!!) with the guarantee of an AU infrastructure\n\n- No loss of production for a site of 20 MW, because of the DIA principle - measure of the production on the site, (ca 300,000 Euros/ 1 MW/ 20 years period)\n\n- introduction to the local EPC and subcontractor\n\n- introduction in a ready to go project in the very competitive Italian market, with a very good connection to the local and provincial authorities\n\n- Already existing legal and technical diligence...\n\nThe response included the following passage:\n\nBy the way, please send us clear idea about DIA and AU. Kindly find the attached Due Diligence document from WATSON, FARLEY and WILLIAMS mentioning legal and connection risk of DIA.\n\nMr. Stein replied:\n\nWe are very surprised in getting no follow up from you regarding our last discussions and mail exchanges. We are going forward on the project and we need to understand your interest on the project.\n\nThe response was as follows:\n\nI was also surprised when I received your last email regarding our questions in DIA and AU. I believe [the company] deserves more explanations or additional information but we feel not. Based upon all the information, we are not confident to pursue the Brindisi project.645\n\nThe market was well aware of the distinction between DIA and AU authorisation, a distinction which predated the Project. Moreover, these exchanges suggest that the Puglia Project was already in significant financial difficulty in the first months of 2011, and independently of the Romani Decree.\n\nE-mail exchange of 29 April 2010, Exhibit C-253.\n\nE-mail exchange of 8 November 2010, Exhibit C-270.\n\nE-mail exchange of 15 June, 7-8 July 2010, Exhibit C-257.\n\n393.\n\nThe Claimants place emphasis on the \u2018rescue\u2019 plan for 27 plants proposed at the end of 2011 (see paragraph 113). The documentation provided in support of this was limited to a non-binding term sheet \u2018for discussion purposes only\u2019, and a signed agreement of Eskosol\u2019s creditors deferring their claims.646 As far as appears from the documentary evidence, work on the 27 plants never commenced: Euro Catalysts, the proposed financier, does not appear to have closed with the offer, still less paid the 20% down payment, and the legal and technical due diligence reports envisaged in the term sheet are not in the record. In fact the construction that was interrupted by the municipal stop-work order of 11 January 2012 (see paragraph 119) was a different one, to build a mere two plants, which could not have rescued the Project. By the end of December 2011 (before the Italian legislation of 2012 further affecting agricultural land), the 27 plants envisaged in the Euro Catalysts term sheet should have been completed. None of this last-gasp activity persuades the Tribunal that the failure of the Project was attributable to Italy.\n\nSee Euro Catalysts Capital, Term Sheet Non Binding for 100% Equity Investing of 27 MW Ground based PV Project, 7 October 2011, Exhibit C-202; Eskosol, Debt Restructuring Agreement, 4 November 2011, Exhibit C-203.\n\n4. Conclusion on Causation\n--------------------------\n\n394.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants have not discharged the onus of proof of establishing that the Italian state\u2019s measures were the operative cause of the Puglia Project\u2019s failure. Of far greater weight was the continued dependence on project financing, and the failure to obtain it was due both to the size of the Project and to justified concerns about the scope of DIA authorisation, on which the legality of the Project depended. That being so, the claim under Article 10(1) for loss of the Project would fail in any event.\n\n5. Overall Conclusions on ECT Article 10(1)\n-------------------------------------------\n\n395.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that there was no breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT.\n\nD. The Expropriation Claim: ECT Article 13\n------------------------------------------\n\n396.\n\nIn the further alternative, the Claimants argue that the Italian measures resulted In the indirect expropriation of the investment, given its total loss of value, contrary to Article 13 of the ECT.\n\n397.\n\nArticle 13(1) provides in relevant part as follows:\n\nInvestments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \u2018Expropriation\u2019) except where such Expropriation is:\n\n(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;\n\n(b) not discriminatory;\n\n(c) carried out under due process of law; and\n\n(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\n398.\n\nThe notion of indirect expropriation has been defined more or less broadly in the decided cases, ranging from the sweeping definition in *Metalclad Corporation* v. *Mexico647* to the careful formulation in *Electrabel v. Hungary.*\n\nAs regards indirect expropriation, the Tribunal considers that the wording of Article 13(1) ECT requires Electrabel to establish that the effect of the PPA\u2019s termination by Hungary was materially the same as if its investment in Dunamenti had been nationalised or directly expropriated by Hungary. In other words, Electrabel must prove, on the facts of this case, that its investment lost all significant economic value with the PPA\u2019s early termination.648\n\nIn none of the decided cases (so far as the Tribunal is aware) has the winding up of an insolvent company by the investor been treated, in and of itself, as a measure \u2018having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation\u2019, whether under NAFTA, the ECT or otherwise. This is true even if the circumstances leading to insolvency included conduct of the host state in breach of the FET standard.649\n\n*Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States,* ICISD Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l, Award, 30 August 2000, Exhibit CL-32, para. 103  ***(Metalclad v. Mexico).***\n\n*Electrabel* v. *Hungary,* Exhibit CL-10, para. 6.53.\n\nCf.*Saluka* v. *Czech Republic,* Exhibit CL-39, para. 265 (Art. 5); 302-497 (Art. 3).\n\n399.\n\nOn the other hand, in a number of cases, state measures targeting the company and imposing major liabilities on it have resulted in insolvency, leading to a finding of indirect expropriation. For example, in *Quasar de Valores* v. *Russian Federation,* the tribunal held that the liquidation auctions in which a major part of the assets was acquired by Rosneft \u2018were part of the same overall scheme of confiscation.\u2019650 The facts of that case were, of course, remote from those of the present one.\n\nSee *Yttkos Russia,* Exhibit CL-22, para. 1183, quoting *Quasar de Valores S1CAVS.A. et al.* v. *Russian Federation,* SCC Arbitration, Award, 20 July 2012.\n\n400.\n\nIn *Nykomb,* an ECT case, the tribunal in rejecting a claim of indirect expropriation said:\n\nThe Tribunal finds that \u2018regulatory takings\u2019 may under the circumstances amount to expropriation or the equivalent of an expropriation. The decisive factor for drawing the border line towards expropriation must primarily be the degree of possession taking or control over the enterprise the disputed measures entail.651\n\nThat was a case of failure to pay the contractually agreed double tariff, in circumstances where Latvia discriminated in favour of other like-situated generators to whom that tariff was paid. This was in breach of Article 10(1) ECT, but not Article 13 (on which the claimant also relied).\n\n*Nykomb Synergetics Technology Holding AB* v. *Republic of Latvia,* SCC, Award, 16 December 2003, Exhibit CL-17, para. 4.3.1.\n\n401.\n\nIn the present case, the Respondent, by non-discriminatory laws ostensibly passed in the public interest, significantly changed the terms laid down in the Third Energy Account for investment in the green energy sector. These changes, combined with operational decisions made by the investors and the lack of prearranged Project financing, meant that the Project remained radically incomplete, never qualified for feed-in tariffs, and inevitably went into liquidation. As a general matter the situation was not analogous, still less tantamount, to expropriation of the Project by Italy.652\n\nIn closing, counsel for the Claimants also cited  **Biloune**  v *Ghana* as bearing \u2018some similarities\u2019 to the present case: Transcript, Day 6,34:8-19 (Barrier), citing *Biloune and Marine Drive Complex Ltd* v. *Ghana Investments Centre and the Government of Ghana,* UNCITRAL Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 22 October 1989. Although  **Biloune**  involved a municipal stop order, what was crucial was the combination of actions taken by various Ghanaian entities - partial demolition of the works, refusal to allow resumption, deportation and refusal of return. The temporary judicial stay here is in obvious contrast.\n\n402.\n\nIn responding to a question from the Tribunal as to what exactly had been taken for the purposes of the Article 13 claim, counsel for the Claimants initially conceded...\n\nthat there was no taking of the investment. However, there was a succession of events that, taken together and in their natural sequence, deprived them from the benefit of their investment.653\n\nThe difficulty with this argument lies in its assumption that the Claimants were already entitled to the full benefit of their investment vis-a-vis the Italian Republic - that is, to the full benefit of current FITs - without complying with the conditions consistently imposed on applicants for FITs, i.e. timely completion of the solar panels and their connection to the grid. And this problem apparently remerges, however the Claimants\u2019 Article 13 case is put. Senior counsel for the Claimants intervened in closing to put the matter in the following terms:\n\nWhat we contend was expropriated was the investments which were lost. The value of the investments... was entirely gone or substantially gone. *So the land that was indirectly acquired was worth a fraction of what it was originally worth.* The project companies which we had acquired were worth nothing. The permits, the authorisations that we had acquired, although we still retained title to them, had no economic value. And as a result, all of the investments that we acquired, we were substantially deprived of.654\n\nThe difficulty here lies in the assumption that what the Claimants or their associates paid for the land was \u2018what it was originally worth.\u2019 But what it was originally worth was its value as agricultural land, and it retained that (low) value after the failure of the Project. Only if the value of the land as against the Italian Republic is taken to be its value as a completed Project already entitled to the benefit of current FITs does the Claimants\u2019 expropriation argument assist. Of course the Claimants argue that the reason for the failure of the Project, with consequent \u2018loss of value\u2019, was the constant changes in Italian policy and law. That argument, under ECT Article 10, first sentence, has already been considered. The essential point does not change by invoking Article 13.\n\nTranscript, Day 6, 31:21-24 (Barrier).\n\nTranscript, Day 6, 34:25 - 35:10 (Legum) (emphasis added).\n\n403.\n\nAnother possibility concerns the limitations imposed on the use of the agricultural land acquired by Eskosol, Blusun\u2019s subsidiary, for the construction of PV arrays. These limitations have already been analysed (see paragraph 104, 120). It could be argued that the effect of the 10% requirement imposed by the Fourth Energy Account was to sterilize the land in Blusun\u2019s hands, since the planned PV units could not be installed without acquiring substantially more land. There is good authority for the proposition that the sterilization of property in the hands of an investor, rendering it impossible to use the property for its intended purpose, can amount to indirect expropriation.655\n\nIn *Metalclad v. Mexico,* Exhibit CL-32, paras. 109-111, the declaration of a nature/reserve over land previously approved for a waste disposal site was held tantamount to expropriation. See also *Companta del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A.* v. *Republic of Costa Rica,* ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1, Award, 17 February 2000, Exhibit CL-26, paras. 76-78.\n\n404.\n\nBut it is very doubtful that the factual predicate for a sterilization case existed here. For one thing, the Claimants, who prior to the insolvency retained full control of their investment, proposed to solve the immediate indebtedness of the Project companies by constructing 27 solar plants; the plan failed, but not because the land was not available. According to their pleaded case, the final blow to the Project came with the municipal stop-work order, which meant that the Fourth Energy Account\u2019s deadlines for qualifying for feed-in tariffs could not be met. That order and its judicial sequel have been dealt with already; they did not involve any breach of the ECT, let alone conduct tantamount to expropriation.\n\n405.\n\nAt one point in its pleadings, the Claimants attributed the failure of the Project, in part at least, to Law Decree 1 of 24 January 2012, Article 65 of which appears to have shortened the 1 year time-limit allowed by the Romani Decree by some two months (see paragraph 120 above).656 In their Reply and in oral argument the final defeat of the Project was rather attributed to the municipal stop-work order, which has already been dealt with (see paragraph 360 above). But since the point was not formally abandoned, the Tribunal will deal briefly with it.\n\nSee Memorial, paras. 340-351; Stein WS1, paras. 169-170. In fact, this is not quite clear, since Law 27/2012 (Exhibit CL-68) appears to have reinstated the exception for plants occupying 50% of agricultural land contained in Art. 10(6) of the Romani Decree, and even extended it slightly to May 2012. The discrepancies associated with the 2012 legislation were not really explored in argument.\n\n406.\n\nTo make their expropriation case on this basis, the Claimants would have to show (a) that but for the one year deadline of the Romani Decree, they would have been expropriated by the change in the land coverage ratio from 50% to 10%; (b) that but for the January 2012 Law they would have met the 29 March 2012 deadline for the Project or a substantial part of it (or alternatively would have sold the Project on to a third party which could have met that deadline), and (c) that they reasonably abandoned the Project between January and March (or lost a credible opportunity to sell it on) because of the abrogation of the deadline by Law Decree 1 of 24 January 2012. But even if point (a) be accepted *arguendo,* the Claimants do not come close to establishing either points (b) or (c), essentially for the reasons already stated (see paragraph 393). It is significant that Siemens unilaterally suspended the construction contract before the Romani Decree, based on non-payment by Eskosol of the initial deposit, and that it was never reinstated: indeed it was formally terminated by letter of 16 December 2011, before Law Decree 1 of 24 January 20 1 2.657 As to selling it on, there is no evidence of a credible buyer prepared to take the risk of completion by 29 March 2012. This version of the expropriation case likewise fails.\n\nLetter from Siemens to Eskosol, 16 December 2011, C-207. The letter closes \u2018We regret for the development of our relationship, born under very different auspices.\u2019\n\n407.\n\nIn the circumstances, the Claimants have not established that any part of the investment was subject to expropriation or a situation tantamount thereto, contrary to Article 13 of the ECT. The Claimants never lost title to the land which was *qua* agricultural land an asset of Eskosol\u2019s in insolvency. The premium paid for the land was at the Claimants\u2019 risk and was not opposable to Italy. In a context in which Blusun\u2019s failure to construct the plants or to connect them to the grid was due to its own investment decisions, notably its failure to attract adequate finance, Italy should not be required to pick up the tab for Blusun\u2019s failures. To put it in other terms, Blusun had no right or legitimate expectation to the enhanced value of the land on the footing that the Project would succeed. This conclusion makes it unnecessary to determine whether changes in planning regulations involving the use to which agricultural land can be put are merely regulatory in any event.658\n\nCf. *Saluka v. Czech Republic,* Exhibit CL-39, paras. 254-265.\n\n408.\n\nThe point can be made in another way. Blusun acquired agricultural land at a substantial overprice. At all times it was aware of what it had to do to unlock the extra value in the land, i.e. to construct the plants and connect them to the grid within applicable time limits. It failed to comply with those conditions. Even if one were to hold, hypothetically, that the reduction of land available for power generation from a ratio of 50% to one of 10% did amount to an indirect expropriation of that fraction of the land thereby rendered useless for the Project, the value to be attributed to the land is the value it continued to have - i.e. the value of unimproved agricultural land as at the date of the Romani Decree. That value did not change: since any additional losses were at the Claimants\u2019 own risk they are not recoverable under Article 13.\n\n409.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal holds (by a majority, Arbitrator Alexandrov dissenting) that the expropriation claim under ECT Article 13 must fail.659\n\nArbitrator Alexandrov disagrees with that conclusion. Blusun acquired agricultural land at a premium. The value of that land today is much lower, *i.e.,* equal to the value of unimproved agricultural land. This was caused by the restrictions imposed by Respondent. While one might accept the proposition that Blusun could have reasonably expected that the tariff regime would change over time (and thus should have accelerated the construction of the plants), it could not have reasonably expected that the government would impose a restriction on the use of the land. That restriction is therefore expropriatory. The Award assumes that even absent the land use restriction the Project would have failed to proceed because of the tariff-related restrictions and, therefore, the land use restriction alone did not cause any loss of value. This analysis, however, disregards the equally likely possibility that the Project did not proceed *due to* the land use restriction. To state it differently, the Award assumes that the land use restriction had no impact on Blusun\u2019s inability to proceed. There is, however, no factual basis for this assumption. The land use restriction may have had an equal, if not greater, impact on the failure of the Project. In that scenario, the damages caused by the land use restriction would have amounted to half, or more, of the value of the Project. Because the land use restriction amounted to an indirect expropriation, damages should follow notwithstanding this uncertainty\u2014at a minimum, in the amount of the lost incremental value of the land.\n\nXI. COSTS\n---------\n\n410.\n\nIn the Reply, the Claimants requested an award in their favour:\n\nOrdering the Italian Republic to pay the expenses incurred by the Claimants in connection with these proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.660\n\nReply, para. 419(d).\n\n411.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to \u2018confirm the conclusions of the Respondent... \u2019:\n\nOrdering the Claimants to pay the expenses incurred by the Italian Republic in connection with these proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements, and to pay the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre, in accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention.661\n\nRejoinder, para. 285(h).\n\n412.\n\nAt the hearing, the Tribunal in consultation with the Parties decided that \u2018it is sufficient if the costs submissions set out the costs and expenses of the parties.\u2019662\n\nTranscript, Day 6, 95:21-23.\n\n413.\n\nThe Claimants submitted claims for legal and other costs (excluding advances made to ICSID) in the amount of \u20ac3,880,337.92, broken down as follows:\n\n\u2022 \u20ac3,343,908.37 in legal fees and expenses; and  \n\u2022 \u20ac536,429.55 in expert fees and expenses.\n\n414.\n\nThey also indicated advance on costs and fee payments in the amount of USD449,920.00.\n\n415.\n\nThe Respondent did not file a submission on costs.\n\n416.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n417.\n\nThis provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney\u2019s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.\n\n418.\n\nThe Tribunal is conscious of Italy\u2019s delay in raising the EU issue and the re-scheduling of the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits that became necessary following the EC\u2019s application to intervene. It will be recalled that the serious difficulties with the admissibility of the EC\u2019s late application were overcome by the Respondent\u2019s endorsement of the application. The Respondent could have made the EU law argument at an earlier stage, but chose to raise separate issues of jurisdiction and admissibility, which have been rejected. Moreover, this was a substantial claim, efficiently presented. In the exercise of its discretion under Article 61(2), the Tribunal has accordingly decided that each party should bear one half of the Tribunal\u2019s costs and that each party should bear its own costs.\n\n419.\n\nThe direct costs of the proceeding include: (i) the fees and expenses of each Member of the Tribunal; (ii) payments made by ICSID for other direct expenses, such as those related to the conduct of hearings (court reporting, audio recording, interpretation, and courier services, as well as estimated charges related to the dispatch of this Award); and (iii) ICSID\u2019s administrative fees.\n\n420.\n\nThese costs amount to (in USD):\n\nArbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Judge James Crawford AC | 130 102,07 |\n| Dr. Stanimir Alexandrov | 144 473,98 |\n| Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy | 135 223,00 |\n| Other expenses (estimate) | 78 022,33 |\n| ICSID\u2019s administrative fees | 96 000 |\n| ICISD\u2019s lodging fee | 25 000 |\n| **Total** | **608,821.38** |\n\n421.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made to ICSID by the Parties. Once the case account balance is final, the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement. The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties taking into account the cost allocation decided by the Tribunal, and in proportion to the advances they made. As a result, each Party\u2019s share of the direct costs of the proceeding amounts to USD304,410,69.\n\n422.\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat received the USD25,000 lodging fee and advance payments in the amount of USD424,920 from the Claimants, and advance payments in the amount of USD275,000 from the Respondent.663 Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Respondent to pay the Claimants USD29,410.69 for the expended portion of the Claimants\u2019 advances to ICSID.\n\nLetters from ICSID to the Parties dated 25 June 2014, 18 August 2014, 15 January 2015, 27 October 2015, 16 June 2016, 30 June 2016, and 17 August 2016.\n\nAWARD\n-----\n\n423.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal:\n\n(a) Holds that it has jurisdiction over the claims brought by the Claimants;\n\n(b) Dismisses those claims on the merits;\n\n(c) Orders the Respondent to pay USD29,410.69 to the Claimants as its share of the costs of the proceedings;\n\n(d) Rejects all other claims for costs."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2020-04-13T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n**ABBREVIATIONS/DEFINED TERMS**\n-------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Application for Annulment | Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein's application for annulment dated April 21, 2017 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID rules of procedure for arbitration Proceedings |\n| Award | Award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal on December 27, 2016 |\n| Background Paper | Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID dated May 5, 2016 |\n| BIT | Bilateral Investment Treaty |\n| Brindisi DIAs | DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Brindisi |\n| Claimants | Blusun S.A., Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein |\n| Committee | The *ad hoc* Committee composed of Professor Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez (President), Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan, and Professor Hi-Taek Shin |\n| COREPER | *Comit\u00e9 des repr\u00e9sentants permanents* (Permanent Representatives Committee) |\n| Counter-Memorial on Annulment | The Respondent's Counter-Memorial on Annulment dated March 16, 2018 |\n| Declaration | 22 EU member states signed a declaration stating that which they draw from application of the European Law, *inter alia,* on the interpretation of the ECT as confirmed by the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Achmea decision. |\n| DIA | Dichiarazioni di Inizio Attivit\u00e0 (Declaration of Initiation of Activity) |\n| ECT | Energy Charter Treaty |\n| EU | European Union |\n| FET | Fair and Equitable Treatment |\n| FIT | Feed-in Tariffs |\n| Fourth Energy Account | Fourth energy account dated May 5, 2011 (Award, para. 107(b) (Tab A)) |\n| GSE | *Gestore dei Servizi Energitici* (Manager of Electricity Services) |\n| Hearing | Hearing on Annulment held on April 11 and 12, 2019 at the World Bank, Paris Office, Paris |\n| ICJ | International Court of Justice |\n| ICSID | International Centre for Settlement of of Investment Disputes |\n| ICSID Convention | Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States |\n| ILC | International Law Commission |\n| Memorial on Annulment | The Claimants\u2019 Memorial on Annulment dated November 3, 2017 |\n| Mesagne DIAs | DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Mesagne |\n| Rejoinder on Annulment | The Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder on Annulment dated July 20, 2018 |\n| Reply on Annulment | The Claimants\u2019 Reply on Annulment dated May 18, 2018 |\n| Request | Italy\u2019s request for an award declaring immediate termination of the Annulment proceeding pursuant to EU Member States Declaration on the legal consequences of Achmea Judgement |\n| Respondent/Italy | The Italian Republic |\n| Romani Decree | Romani Decree of 3 March 2011 (CL-51) |\n| Third Energy Account | The third energy account adopted by ministerial decree on August 6, 2010 (CL-55, Decreto Ministeriale 6 agosto 2010) |\n| Tr.

PARTIES**\n--------------\n\n1.\n\nThe disputing parties are the Italian Republic (the \"**Respondent**\" or \"**Italy**\") and the Claimants in the original arbitration proceeding: Blusun S.A. (\"**Blusun**\"), Jean-Pierre Lecorcier and Michael Stein (collectively, the \"**Claimants**\" or the \"**Applicants**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent and the Claimants are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"**Parties.**\"\n\n**II. INTRODUCTION**\n--------------------\n\n3.\n\nThis case concerns an application for annulment by the Claimants (\"**Application for Annulment**\") for the alleged dismissal of claims on their merits pronounced by the Award dispatched to the Parties on December 27, 2016 (the \"**Award**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Award related to a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\") on the basis of the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty (the \"**ECT**\"), as well as the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and nationals of other States (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimants argued that the Tribunal which rendered the Award (the \"**Tribunal**\"), decided that it had jurisdiction over the claims brought by the Claimants against the Italian Republic, dismissed those claims on merits, and in doing so, the Tribunal inexplicably failed to consider the measure at the heart of one of those claims and on which the other claims relied in important respects.\n\n6.\n\nCentral to each claim advanced by the Claimants lies certain investments made concerning a solar energy project in the Puglia region of Italy: a 120-megawatt project, where plants were to be connected with each other by a medium-voltage grid, with electricity sub-stations constructed to connect that grid to the high-voltage grid. The project consisted of uniting approximately 120 individual solar plants of one megawatt each. 114 of the 120 plants were to be built in the municipality of Brindisi and the remaining six in the municipality of Mesagne. The project also required the construction of a network of underground cables spread over 370 kilometers. These cables formed two rings connecting the solar plants to each other, and to two substations. The Claimants acquired the shares of 12 local development companies which hold all of the relevant rights and permits for the plants via Eskosol S.R.L (\"**Eskosol**\"), an Italian company owned and controlled by Blusun (the \"**Project**\" or \"**Puglia project**\").\n\n7.\n\nThe dispute in the underlying arbitration related to certain regulatory and judicial measures adopted by the Italian Government, which in the Claimants\u2019 view frustrated their investments in the Puglia project.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants advanced three distinct legal claims in the original arbitration proceedings: (a) the first claim was for an alleged breach of Article 10(1), first sentence, of the ECT: such claim was advanced on the basis that in the Claimants\u2019 view, the Italian Government failed to encourage and create stable, equitable, favorable, and transparent conditions for the Claimants\u2019 Investments in the Puglia project (the \"**Legal Instability Claim**\"); (b) the second claim was for an alleged breach of Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT: this claim was advanced on the basis that in the Claimants\u2019 view, Italy failed to accord fair and equitable treatment to their investments, namely regarding certain legitimate expectations (the \"**Legitimate Expectations Claim**\"); and (c) the third claim was advanced on the basis that in the Claimants\u2019 view the regulatory measures and judicial decisions adopted by the Italian Constitutional Court, the Italian Government and the Commune had an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the ECT (the \"**Expropriation Claim**\").\n\n9.\n\nThe Claimants seek annulment of the entirety of the Award\u2019s alleged dismissal of the Claims on their Merits, on the basis of Article 52(1) (b), (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention. Such grounds of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention respectively state as follows: (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers; (ii) the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure; and (iii) that the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n10.\n\nThe Application for Annulment submitted by the Claimants mainly rests on the foregoing legal grounds. Each one of the legal grounds of Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, in the present Annulment proceedings, has the exact same factual basis.1 These are the alleged dismissal of the Tribunal by not considering and addressing the DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Brindisi, while adjudicating the Legitimate Expectation claim. This is precisely the omission addressed by the Claimants in their Application for Annulment and it is central to the second claim brought by the Claimants in the original arbitration proceedings, their Legitimate Expectations Claim.2 This, according to Claimants, breaches Article 52(1) (b) (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee will, therefore, examine these grounds.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 100.\n\nApplication for Annulment, para. 5.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n11.\n\nOn February 4, 2014, ICSID received a request for arbitration from Blusun against Italy (the \"RfA\").\n\n12.\n\nOn February 21, 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the RfA in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n13.\n\nOn June 12, 2014, a Tribunal composed of Prof. James Crawford, a national of Australia, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. Stanimir Alexandrov, a national of Bulgaria, appointed by the Claimant; and Prof. Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent, was constituted.\n\n14.\n\nOn July 28, 2014, the Tribunal held its first session by telephone conference.\n\n15.\n\nOn July 30, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1. The Parties subsequently filed the following submissions:\n\n\u2022 The Claimants' Memorial on the Merits on July 31, 2014;\n\n\u2022 The Respondent's Counter-Memorial on the Merits on December 19, 2014;\n\n\u2022 The Claimants' Reply on the Merits on May 8, 2015; and\n\n\u2022 The Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits on October 16, 2015.\n\n16.\n\nOn October 23, 2015, the European Commission (the \"Commission\") filed an application to file a written submission pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).\n\n17.\n\nOn October 28, 2015, both Parties filed observations on the Commission\u2019s application. In its observations, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal bifurcate the proceedings and address jurisdiction as a preliminary matter.\n\n18.\n\nOn October 30, 2015, the Tribunal granted the Commission permission to supplement its application, which it duly did on November 12, 2015.\n\n19.\n\nOn November 13, 2015, the President held a pre-hearing conference with the Parties.\n\n20.\n\nOn November 18, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 in which it decided, *inter alia,* to suspend the hearing then schedule for November 30 through December 4, 2015 in order to address the Commission\u2019s application.\n\n21.\n\nOn January 22, 2016 and February 26, 2016, the Respondent and the Claimants, respectively, filed further observations on the Commission\u2019s application. In its submission, the Respondent reiterated its request for the bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n22.\n\nOn March 19, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 admitting the Commission\u2019s submission of November 12, 2015 into the record.\n\n23.\n\nOn March 19, 2016, the Tribunal also issued Procedural Order No. 4 in which it rejected the Respondent\u2019s request to bifurcate the proceedings.\n\n24.\n\nFrom April 25 through April 28, 2016, the Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction and the merits in Paris.\n\n25.\n\nOn June 21, 2016, Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione (\"Eskosol\"), an Italian subsidiary of Blusun, filed an application to intervene as a non-disputing party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).\n\n26.\n\nOn June 21 and 22, 2016, the Tribunal held a further hearing on jurisdiction and the merits in Paris. During the final day of the hearing, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their comments on Eskosol\u2019s application.\n\n27.\n\nOn June 30, 2016 (the Respondent) and July 1, 2016 (the Claimants), both Parties asked that the Tribunal deny Eskosol\u2019s application to intervene.\n\n28.\n\nOn July 8, 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, rejecting Eskosol\u2019s application to intervene as a non-disputing party.\n\n29.\n\nOn August 1, 2016, the Claimants filed a submission for costs.\n\n30.\n\nOn November 22, 2016, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 38(1).\n\n31.\n\nOn December 27, 2016, the Tribunal rendered its award.\n\n32.\n\nOn April 21, 2017, ICSID received an Application for Annulment (the \"Application\") from Blusun. The Application for Annulment was made within the time-period provided in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention. Blusun sought annulment of the Award based on the following three grounds:\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal *manifestly exceeded its powers* because it was part of the Tribunal\u2019s mandate and jurisdiction *ratione materiae* to consider, when adjudicating Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations claim, the DIA certificates of conformity relevant to that claim, i.e. those from the municipality of Brindisi, and it manifestly failed to do so.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal *departed from the fundamental rules of procedure* because it appeared from paragraph 379 of the Award that the Tribunal considered only the first page of Exhibit C-24, and that it failed to consider the translation of a template of a translation of 48 certificates of conformity from the Municipality of Brindisi. Yet these certificates were part of the same exhibit and included the mention that \"[t]*his activity is in accordance with general urban planning instruments*.\" These certificates were at the center of the Claimants\u2019 claim on legitimate expectations, and no reasonable review of the record could possibly overlook this.\n\n\u2022 The Tribunal *failed to state reasons* because it did not address the DIA certificates in its analysis of the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations claim.\n\n33.\n\nOn May 2, 2017, the Acting Secretary-General registered the Application.\n\n34.\n\nBy letter of June 7, 2017, ICSID informed the Parties that it intended to recommend to the Chairman of the Administrative Council the appointment of Prof. Donald McRae, a national of Canada and New Zealand, as President of the *ad hoc* Committee (the \"Committee\"), with Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan, a national of Pakistan, and Prof. Hi-Taek Shin, a national of the Republic of Korea, serving as co-members. The Centre invited the Parties to provide any comments on the proposed appointments by June 14, 2017.\n\n35.\n\nBy letter of June 15, 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID noted that no objections to the proposed Committee members had been received and stated that the Chairman would therefore proceed to the appointment the candidates.\n\n36.\n\nBy letter of June 16, 2017, the Centre confirmed that the Chairman had appointed the proposed Committee members.\n\n37.\n\nOn June 20, 2017, the Acting Secretary-General informed the Parties that the Committee was constituted in accordance with Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention. Its members were: Prof. Donald McRae (Canadian, New Zealand), President; Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan (Pakistani); and Prof. Hi-Taek Shin (Korean).\n\n38.\n\nBy letter of June 23, 2017, the Committee invited the Parties to provide their availability for a first session.\n\n39.\n\nBy letter of June 28, 2017, the Claimants provided their availability for the first session. By email of the same date, the Respondent stated that it was unavailable during any of the proposed times and asked the Committee to postpone the first session until September 2017.\n\n40.\n\nBy email of July 5, 2017, the Claimants informed the Committee that the Parties had agreed, subject to the Committee\u2019s approval, to forego a first session and reach an agreement on the text of Procedural Order No. 1 between themselves. By email of the same date, the Respondent confirmed its agreement with the Claimants\u2019 email. The Respondent reiterated its agreement by email of July 10, 2017.\n\n41.\n\nBy letter of July 10, 2017, the Committee transmitted a draft Procedural Order No. 1 to the Parties and invited them to provide their comments and any points of disagreement by July 26, 2017.\n\n42.\n\nBy email of July 26, 2017, the Claimants requested, on behalf of both Parties, an extension until August 4, 2017 to provide comments on Procedural Order No. 1. By email of July 27, 2017, the Committee granted the requested extension.\n\n43.\n\nOn August 3, 2017, the Parties provided an agreed-upon version of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n44.\n\nBy letter of August 25, 2017, the Committee asked the Parties to officially confirm that they had no need of a first session. By email of August 26, 2017, the Claimants provided their confirmation. By email of August 28, 2017, the Respondent provided its confirmation.\n\n45.\n\nOn August 28, 2017, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia,* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April 10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out the agreed schedule for the proceedings, which was later modified by agreement of the Parties.\n\n46.\n\nOn November 3, 2017, the Claimants filed their Memorial on Annulment (the \"Memorial\") with supporting documentation.\n\n47.\n\nOn March 16, 2018, the Respondent files its Counter-Memorial on Annulment (the \"Counter-Memorial\") with supporting documentation.\n\n48.\n\nBy letter of March 23, 2018, the Centre informed the Parties that Prof. Donald McRae had submitted his resignation from the Committee and that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2), the proceedings would be suspended until a replacement appointment had been made.\n\n49.\n\nBy letter of May 4, 2018, the Secretary-General informed the Parties that she intended to ask the Chairman of the Administrative Council to appoint Professor Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hernandez as President of the Committee and invited the Parties to provide any comments by May 11, 2018.\n\n50.\n\nBy email of May 5, 2018, the Claimants asked for confirmation that Prof. Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez was available to attend the hearing scheduled for October 2018. By email of May 9, 2018, Prof. Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez confirmed his availability.\n\n51.\n\nBy letter of May 14, 2018, the Secretary-General confirmed that she would proceed to ask the Chairman of the Administrative Council to appoint Prof. Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\n52.\n\nBy email of May 18, 2018, the Claimants asked for confirmation of Prof. Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez's appointment to allow for the official resumption of the proceedings so the Claimants could submit their Reply on Annulment.\n\n53.\n\nBy letter of May 18, 2018, ICSID informed the Parties that Prof. Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez had accepted his appointment and the Committee had been reconstituted with the proceedings resuming as of that date.\n\n54.\n\nOn May 18, 2018, the Claimants submitted their Reply on Annulment (the \"Reply\") with accompanying documentation.\n\n55.\n\nBy letter of June 28, 2018, Prof. Shin provided a disclosure regarding his involvement in *JGC Corporation v. Kingdom of Spain* (ICSID Case No. ARB/15/27) and confirmed that it would not affect his independence and impartiality in these proceedings.\n\n56.\n\nOn July 20, 2018, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on Annulment (the \"Rejoinder\") with accompanying documentation.\n\n57.\n\nBy letter of August 23, 2018, the Committee provided a draft agenda for the organization of the hearing and invited the Parties to agree to its contents by email; should they be unable to do so, the Committee provided a proposed date and time for a telephone conference to discuss outstanding issues.\n\n58.\n\nBy email of August 31, 2018, the Claimants submitted the Parties' joint agenda and stated that there would be no need for a pre-hearing conference. By email of the same date, the Respondent confirmed its agreement.\n\n59.\n\nBy letter of September 12, 2018, the Claimants stated that they would be unable to pay the second advance, requested on August 22, 2018, before the end of the year. In light of this, they asked that the hearing be rescheduled for the first quarter of 2019.\n\n60.\n\nBy letter of September 17, 2018, the Committee took note of the Claimants\u2019 letter of September 12, 2018 and proposed April 11 and 12, 2019 as new dates for the hearing. By emails of September 21, 2018, the Parties confirmed their availability for the proposed dates.\n\n61.\n\nOn February 4, 2019, the Respondent submitted its \"Request for an award declaring immediate termination \u2014 EU Members States Declaration on the legal consequences of *Achmea\"* (the \"Request for Termination\") along with a declaration on the consequences of the *Achmea* award issued by Member States of the European Union (the *\"Achmea* Declaration\").\n\n62.\n\nBy letter of February 5, 2019, the Claimants provided their comments on the Request for Termination.\n\n63.\n\nBy letter of February 12, 2019, the Committee took note of the Parties\u2019 submissions on the Request for Termination and stated that it would hear further arguments on the matter at the upcoming hearing.\n\n64.\n\nOn March 12, 2019, the Centre provided the Parties with a draft hearing agenda based on the agreed-upon version for the originally scheduled hearing and asked them to provide any comments by March 21, 2019. By email of March 13, 2019, the Claimants confirmed that they had no comments. By email of March 18, 2019, the Respondent confirmed that it had no comments.\n\n65.\n\nBy email of April 9, 2019, the Claimants stated their assumption that the agenda circulated on March 12, 2019 should be considered final in absence of comments from the Parties and asked the Committee to correct them if this was not the case.\n\n66.\n\nOn April 11 and 12, 2019, a Hearing on Annulment was held in Paris (the \"Hearing\"). The following persons were present at the Hearing:\n\n*Ad hoc Committee':*  \nProf. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hernandez President  \nMr. Makhdoom Ali Khan Member  \nProf. Hi-Taek Shin Member\n\n*ICSID Secretariat* :  \nMs. Ella Rosenberg Secretary of the *ad hoc* Committee\n\n*For Blusun* :  \n***Counsel***  \nMr. Jean-Christophe Honlet Dentons Europe LLP  \nMr. Barton Legum Dentons Europe LLP  \nMs. Anne-Sophie Duf\u00eatre Dentons Europe LLP  \nMs. Marie-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Ludwig Dentons Europe LLP  \nMs. Juliette Musso Dentons Europe LLP\n\n***Parties***  \nMr. Jean-Pierre Lecorcier Claimant  \nMr. Michael Stein Claimant\n\n*For Italy* :  \n***Counsel***  \nAvv.

On July 3, 2019, the Respondent filed its revised statement on costs.\n\n70.\n\nOn April 3, 2020 the proceeding was closed.\n\n**IV. THE AWARD OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. The Tribunal\u2019s reasoning concerning the three claims advanced by the Claimants in the original proceedings as set forth in the Award**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nOn December 27, 2016, the Tribunal rendered its Award. The Tribunal\u2019s reasoning with respect to the three claims made by the Claimants is described below.\n\n**(i) Legal Instability Claim: Breach of Article 10(1), first sentence of the ECT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants contended that they did not claim that Italy\u2019s legislation had to remain immutable, unchanged, or written in stone and that their case was not about regulatory change, but about regulatory turbulence. Rather, they contended that the legal framework for a solar energy project in the Puglia region of Italy constantly fluctuated between the legally permissible and impossible, for two years, leaving no period of stability in which the requisite capital investment for a project of this size could be realized.3\n\nAward, para. 320.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimants contended that a series of measures adopted by the Italian Government in relation to the Puglia project amounted to a breach of the legal stability standard set out in the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the ECT.4 Such measures, as stated by the Claimants, are the following: (a) the Constitutional Court decision and its aftermath; (b) the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account; (c) the uncertainties associated with the publication of multiple lists of eligible plants by GSE; and (d) the Brindisi stop-work order and related events.5\n\nArticle 10(1): Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.\"\n\nIbid., 321.\n\n74.\n\nThe Tribunal observed, in this regard, that the Claimants did not suggest that these events were directly linked or that the sequence was the result of any design on the part of the Italian State. This, according to the Tribunal, was no conspiracy but a series of disconnected acts of alleged disregard for the Claimants\u2019 rights.6\n\nIbid.\n\n**(ii) Legitimate Expectations Claim: Breach of Article 10(1), second sentence of the ECT**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nIn accordance with the Award \"[t]he Claimants present an alternative formulation of an Article 10(1) claim based essentially on legitimate expectations. In effect, it is argued that persons in the Claimants\u2019 position had a legitimate expectation that the Third Energy Account would be maintained for the term envisaged:\n\nthe Claimants had legitimate expectations that the Third Energy Account would remain in place for its entire duration according to its terms; that is, until the end of 2013. However, the Romani Decree frustrated the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations in this respect.7\n\nAward, para. 365, citing Reply, paras. 217, 298-319; Arbitration Tr. Day 5, 71:12-17 (Dufetre).\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that this argument had the effect of treating the law not as a general command but as an individual commitment, at least where the law is enacted for the benefit of a determinate class of persons.8\n\nAward, para. 365.\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal observed that so far, tribunals have declined to sanctify laws as promises,9 and that \"there is still a clear distinction between a law, i.e. a norm of greater or lesser generality creating rights and obligations while it remains in force, and a promise or contractual commitment.\"10\n\nIbid., 367, citing *Charanne B.V., Construction Invesments SA.R.E. v. Kingdom of Spain,* SCC Case No. 062/2012, Final Award, January 21, 2016, para. 510, Legal Authority CL-208; *El Paso Energy International Company v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, October 31, 2011, para. 372, Legal Authority CL-109 *(\u2018El Paso* Award\").\n\nAward, para. 371.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal also observed that \"in the absence of a specific commitment, the state has no obligation to grant subsidies such as feed in tariffs, or to maintain them unchanged, once granted.\"11\n\nIbid., para. 372.\n\n79.\n\nThe Tribunal concluded by stating, \"the Respondent made no special commitment to the Claimants with respect to the extension and operation of FITs, nor did it specifically undertake that relevant Italian laws would remain unchanged. For these reasons the Claimants have not established a breach of Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT.\"12\n\nIbid., para. 374.\n\n**(iii) The Expropriation Claim: Breach of Article 13(1) of the ECT**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nIn the alternative, the Tribunal addressed Claimants\u2019 indirect expropriation claim under Article 13 of the ECT13 \"the Italian measures resulted in the indirect expropriation of the investment, given its total loss of value, contrary to Article 13 of the ECT.\"14\n\n\"Article 13: Expropriation  \n(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"Expropriation\") except where such Expropriation is:  \n(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;  \n(b) not discriminatory;  \n(c) carried out under due process of law; and  \n(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.  \nSuch compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation or impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the value of the Investment (hereinafter referred to as the \"Valuation Date\").  \nSuch fair market value shall at the request of the Investor be expressed in a Freely Convertible Currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of Expropriation until the date of payment.  \n(2) The Investor affected shall have a right to prompt review, under the law of the Contracting Party making the Expropriation, by a judicial or other competent and independent authority of that Contracting Party, of its case, of the valuation of its Investment, and of the payment of compensation, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph (1).  \n(3) For the avoidance of doubt, Expropriation shall include situations where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company or enterprise in its Area in which an Investor of any other Contracting Party has an Investment, including through the ownership of shares.\"\n\nIbid., para. 396.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal recalled previous case law on the subject:\n\nAs regards indirect expropriation, the Tribunal considers that the wording of Article 13(1) ECT requires Electrabel to establish that the effect of the PPA\u2019s termination by Hungary was materially the same as if its investment in Dunamenti had been nationalised or directly expropriated by Hungary. In other words, Electrabel must prove, on the facts of this case, that its investment lost all significant economic value with the PPA\u2019s early termination.\"15\n\nIbid., para. 398 citing *Metalclad Corporation v. United Mexican States,* ICISD Case No. ARB(AF)/97/l, Award, August 30, 2000, para. 103, Legal Authority CL-32.\n\n82.\n\nThe Tribunal decided that, \"in the present case, the Respondent, by non-discriminatory laws, ostensibly passed in the public interest, significantly changed the terms laid down in the Third Energy Account for investment in the green energy sector. These changes, combined with operational decisions made by the investors, and the lack of prearranged Project financing, meant that the Project remained radically incomplete, never qualified for feed-in tariffs, and inevitably went into liquidation. As a general matter the situation was not analogous, still less tantamount, to expropriation of the Project by Italy.\"16\n\nAward, para. 401, at footnote 652, \"In closing, counsel for the Claimants also cited *Biloune v Ghana* as bearing \u2018some similarities\u2019 to the present case: [Arbitration] Tr. Day 6, 34:8-19 (Barrier), citing *Biloune and Marine Drive Complex Ltd v. Ghana Investments Centre and the Government of Ghana,* UNCITRAL Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, October 22, 1989. Although Biloune involved a municipal stop order, what was crucial was the combination of actions taken by various Ghanaian entities \u2014 partial demolition of the works, refusal to allow resumption, deportation and refusal of return. The temporary judicial stay here is in obvious contrast.\"\n\n**V. THE PARTIES\u2019 INTERPRETATION OF THE AWARD REGARDING THE DIA CERTIFICATES OF CONFORMITY**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. DIA Certificates of Conformity within the Legitimate Expectations Claim**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimants begin by explaining that the Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction over the claims brought by the Claimants against Italy, without restriction, but dismissed those claims on merits.17\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 51.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal correctly understood the Claimants\u2019 three distinct claims, as such.18 They submit that \"[t]he Tribunal also correctly understood one of the Claimants\u2019 two bases of its Legitimate Expectations Claim, i.e. the expectations that legitimately arose from the DIA Certificates of Conformity and were later dashed by measures adopted by the municipality of Brindisi.\"19\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 53.\n\nIbid., para. 54.\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal also correctly recalled, at paragraph 165 of the Award, the multiple representations made by the Italian Government. According to these representations, as per the Claimants, the construction of specific plants was in accordance with the procedures set out in Regional Law n. 31/2008 and was within the scope of general urban planning instruments.20\n\nIbid., para. 57.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal also recalled the assertion made by them in the original proceedings that \"for at least two years after having granted the DIA authorisations, the municipality \u2018took no step to suggest that it had any doubt about the validity of the authorisations granted.\"\"21 \"This, in the Claimants' view, amounted to an implicit representation that gave rise to legitimate expectations,\"22 and that in recognition of such situation, the Tribunal cited in footnote the Claimants' Memorial at paragraph 446, and referenced in that footnote the Claimants' factual exhibit upon which they based their assertion, **Exhibit C-24**.23\n\nIbid., para. 60.\n\nIbid., para. 61.\n\nIbid., para. 58. See also footnote 257, Award.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimants contend that in paragraph 167 of the Award, the Tribunal recalled the Claimants' assertion that the stop-work order \"\u2018was contrary to the very regional law with which [the municipality of Brindisi] had previously certified [the construction of the solar plant's] compliance,\"' and, thus, emphasized the importance for the Claimants of the representations made in the DIA Certificates of Conformity reproduced as **Exhibit C-24**.24\n\nIbid., para. 62. Footnote omitted.\n\n88.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal reviewed each of the Claimants' three separate claims one by one.25 The Legitimate Expectations Claim is dealt with in paragraphs 365 to 374 of the Award, in a section entitled \"B. Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: ECT Article 10(1), second sentence (legitimate expectations).\"26 The Claimants contend that the Tribunal recalled the Claimants' position that the DIA Certificates of Conformity had created legitimate expectations, protected under Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT; it was thus expected that the Tribunal would adjudicate this claim in paragraphs 365 to 374 of the Award.27 However, in the Claimants\u2019 view, a reading of the Award discloses that the Tribunal did not discuss the DIA Certificates of Conformity at all in this section, nor did it mention the 48 certificates from the municipality of Brindisi or the five certificates from the municipality of Mesagne.28\n\nIbid., para. 63.\n\nIbid., para. 64.\n\nIbid., para. 65.\n\nIbid., para. 66.\n\n89.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the only question the Tribunal discussed in this section is whether the Claimants had a legitimate expectation that the \"Third Energy Account would be maintained for the term envisaged [...].\"29 The Claimants assert that the Third Energy Account was also relied upon by the Claimants as a separate prong of their Legitimate Expectations Claim, but it was unrelated to the DIA Certificates of Conformity. They contend that the DIA Certificates of Conformity concerned the authorizations to build the solar plants, while the Third Energy Account related to the price at which electricity would be sold.30\n\nIbid., para. 67. Footnote omitted.\n\nIbid., para. 68.\n\n90.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the prior discussion concerning whether they had a legitimate expectation that the Third Energy Account would be maintained for the term envisaged within section B. Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: ECT Article 10(1), second sentence (legitimate expectations), instead of the discussion of legitimate expectations concerning the DIA Certificates of Conformity, as it should have been. The Claimants assert that the Tribunal could not have been confused and mixed the two together as they had addressed the DIA Certificates of Conformity first at page 6 of their opening presentation at the hearing, while the Third Energy Account was addressed subsequently at slide 35 of the presentation and thereafter. As the Tribunal could not have confused the two categories of measures, it obviously failed to consider the DIA Certificates of Conformity in adjudicating the Legitimate Expectations Claim.31\n\nIbid., para. 69. Footnote omitted.\n\n91.\n\nThe Claimants submit that it is not until the reader reaches the next section, \"C,\" i.e., issue of Causation in relation to ECT Article 10(1), that they can, for the first time, see a mention of the DIA Certificates of Conformity in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis. Section C is a separate section from prior Section B. The Claimants also argue that Section C does not deal with the Legitimate Expectations Claim but with causation in relation to the first two sentences of Article 10(1) ECT, which, according to them, is a conceptually distinct question.32\n\nIbid., para. 70. Footnote omitted.\n\n92.\n\nWithin Section C regarding the subject of causation, in the Annulment Proceeding, the Claimants rely heavily on paragraph 379 of the Award within this section. It states as follows:\n\nThe Claimants relied on the DIAs as amounting to a definitive authorization for the individual plants. They refer by way of example to a Notice of the Municipality of Mesagne with the notation \u2018The local development companies obtain the 53d DIA Certificate of Conformity, stating that the construction of the given solar plants was in accordance with the relevant regulations.\u2019 In fact the Notice states in its operative clause that the DIA procedure \u2018is to be regarded as complete\u2019, which is not at all the same thing.33\n\nAward, para. 379.\n\n93.\n\nBased on paragraph 379 of the Award, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal quoted only from the first page of the PDF of **Exhibit C-24**. According to Claimants, the Tribunal correctly characterized it as a certificate from the municipality of Mesagne (which had issued five Certificates of Conformity only). The Claimants submit that the Tribunal, however, completely failed to consider the 48 certificates issued by the municipality of Brindisi and which were translated in template form on the third page of the PDF of **Exhibit C-24**. According to the Claimants, only the DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Brindisi were relevant to the Legitimate Expectations Claim. The municipality of Mesagne never instituted self-redress proceedings or stop-work orders, or otherwise questioned the legality of the DIAs it represented to be complete. It was the measures adopted by the municipality of Brindisi that were alleged, in the Legitimate Expectations Claim, to have violated the ECT by directly contradicting representations specifically made with respect to the construction of the very plants at issue. Yet, inexplicably, according to the Claimants, nowhere in the Award did the Tribunal address the DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Brindisi, in spite of the fact that these were relevant to the claims before it.34\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 72.\n\n**(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent begins by asserting that the Claimants have made an unwarranted inference from an isolated reading of one paragraph of the Award, i.e. paragraph 379. The Respondent submits that the Claimants are reading what is, in fact, a reproach made in passing (directed at an inaccuracy in their own Memorial and Reply) as evidence of the Tribunal\u2019s negligence. The Respondent disputes that there was an oversight or that that the alleged oversight had wide-reaching repercussions which undermined the viability of the Award.35\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 4.\n\n95.\n\nThe Respondent submitted that \"the Claimants asserted that the Tribunal ha[d] not given adequate consideration to the fraction of their Legitimate Expectations Claim that relied on certain documents of certification issued by the municipality of Brindisi (the *\"Dichiarazioni di Inizio Attivit\u00e0\",* or DIAs, which authorised the construction of solar plants).\" It contended that \"this assertion is groundless, but the gateway question is rather whether it would even matter in annulment proceedings, even if it were true.\" According to the Respondent, it would not, but the Claimants nevertheless seek, on this basis, the annulment of *\"the entirety* of the Award\u2019s dismissal of the claims on their merits.\"36\n\nIbid., para. 5.\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 case rests on two arguments:37\n\n(a) First, the Tribunal allegedly \"failed to address the DIA Certificates of Conformity... when adjudicating the Legitimate Expectations Claim.\"38\n\n(b) Second, the Tribunal allegedly addressed only the DIA Certificates issued by the municipality of Mesagne (the \"Mesagne DIAs\"), failing to consider the DIA Certificates issued by the municipality of Brindisi (the \"Brindisi DIAs\").39\n\nIbid., para. 12.\n\nIbid., para. 13.\n\nIbid., para. 14.\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent contends that these arguments are ill-founded in fact and in law.40 It also contends that the factual premises for the submission of the Claimants is mistaken for the following reasons:\n\n(a) First, the Tribunal did address the DIA Certificates. In the Award, an entire section of the part on causation is dedicated to *\"[t]he status of the DIAs and the Project as a unified scheme.\" This part of* the Award, highlighting the absence of legitimate expectations and the lack of causation between Italy's acts and the Applicant's business misfortunes, is an integral part of the reasons why the Legitimate Expectations Claim did fail....\n\n(b) Second, the Tribunal did not \"*refer... only\"* to the DIA Certificates issued by the municipality of Mesagne. To the contrary, it did mention them *\"by way of example.\"* The obvious implication is that the Tribunal considered all DIA Certificates, and singled out some of them to point out an inaccuracy in the Claimants' Reply....41\n\nIbid., para. 17.\n\nIbid., para. 17. Footnotes omitted.\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants' argument that the Tribunal did not address the DIA Certificates of Conformity is plainly incorrect.42 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal \"located,\" \"read\" and by all appearances \"consider[ed]\" the Brindisi DIAs. Paragraph 165 of the Award, as the Claimants readily conceded, discusses precisely those documents and includes a footnote pointing to the correct Exhibit (C-24). Besides, the Tribunal also dutifully noted the Claimants' argument that these documents \"gave rise to legitimate expectations.\"43\n\nIbid., para. 23.\n\nIbid., para. 24.\n\n99.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal addressed the merits of the Claimants' claim in part X of the Award.44 Specifically, the Tribunal addressed the two claims based on Article 10(1) of the ECT (namely, the \"Legal Instability Claim\" in Section A and the \"Legitimate Expectations Claim\" in Section B), as well as the Expropriation Claim (in Section D).45\n\nIbid., para. 25.\n\nIbid., para. 26. See also footnotes 15, 16 and 17, Counter-Memorial on Annulment.\n\n100.\n\nItaly submits that the two claims based on Article 10(1) of the ECT ((i) Legal Instability Claim; and (ii) Legitimate Expectations Claim) were also discussed jointly with respect to one aspect that they had in common: the issue of causation.46 It also submits that in order \"[t]o entertain the claim under Article 10(1) ECT the Tribunal needed to be satisfied that Italy's acts caused the failure of the Project. The Award dedicated a specific section to this determination (Section C of Part X), which applied to both Article 10(1) ECT claims \u2014 the Legal Instability and Legitimate Expectations claims \u2014 but treated these jointly to avoid repetition.\"47\n\nIbid., para. 27.\n\nIbid. See also footnote 18, Counter-Memorial on Annulment.\n\n101.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal addressed the Legitimate Expectations Claim in Part X, in Sections B and C, the latter addressing a specific aspect \u2014 the causal link \u2014 that was critical to this specific claim's chances of success.\n\n102.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that when addressing the causation element, the Tribunal discussed the Claimants' reliance on the DIAs (which had been introduced earlier, in para. 165) along with the other documents and acts that allegedly generated their legitimate expectations. According to the Respondent, the Tribunal noted that the DIAs did not represent a firm assurance that the plants would receive FITs at any fixed rate:48\n\n379. The Claimants relied on the DIAs as amounting to a definitive authorization for the individual plants...\n\n380. At no stage did the Claimants obtain unconditional assurances from the central Government as to their plants' entitlement to FITs, or to the level of such FITs.49\n\nIbid., para. 31. See also paras. 379 and 380 of the Award.\n\nSee footnote 22, Counter-Memorial on Annulment.\n\n103.\n\nRegarding the prior cited paragraphs, the Respondent submits that paragraph 380 shifts the focus from the DIAs to the critical aspect of the Claimants' lack of entitlements in the FITs.50 Italy also contends that even accepting, for the sake of argument, that the Tribunal failed to countenance the reassuring function of the Brindisi DIAs, this would be a matter of merits and should not engage the review of an annulment committee. Further, the point would remain that the Claimants never received any specific assurances that they would receive any FIT, at any specific rate.51\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 32.\n\nIbid., para. 33.\n\n104.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants\u2019 submissions with regard to the Tribunal\u2019s failure to consider the Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity are based both on a misreading of paragraph 379 itself and on reading it in isolation. According to the Respondent, the Tribunal not only addressed the DIAs while discussing the Legitimate Expectations Claim, but it also did so when analyzing one specific aspect thereof: causation.52 The Respondent also contends that \"it is also very clear that the Tribunal did not consider the DIAs to be particularly meaningful, as they did not generate any legitimate expectation with respect to a specific rate of FITs.\"53\n\nIbid., para. 35.\n\nIbid., para. 36.\n\n**B. The Tribunal addressed only the DIAs issued by the Municipality of Mesagne**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nThe Claimants base their assertion on the Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to consider a series of documents central to the Claimants\u2019 claim on Legitimate Expectations, second prong. They specifically refer to the DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Brindisi. They draw attention to paragraph 379 of the Award. The Claimants submit that this document was cited no less than 30 times by the Claimants in the original arbitration. They also argue that this was repeatedly referred to before the Tribunal at the hearing. The Tribunal implicitly observed, in paragraph 165 of the Award, that it would address this document. It, however, failed to do so.54\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 2.\n\n106.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal only considered the template of the five Certificates issued by the municipality of Mesagne, but completely failed to consider the 48 certificates issued by the municipality of Brindisi and translated in template form on the third page of the PDF of **Exhibit C-24**. The Claimants submit that in a separate and different part of the Award, other than the one discussing the Legitimate Expectations Claim,55 specifically Section C regarding causation, at paragraph 379, the Tribunal discussed the five DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Mesagne. According to the Claimants, the Tribunal, however, inexplicably failed to address the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Brindisi. This, the Claimants submit, was in spite of the fact that the Tribunal had announced, in paragraph 165 of the Award, that it would do so.56\n\nAward, Part X, B. Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: ECT Article 10(1), second sentence (legitimate expectations).\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 37. Footnote omitted.\n\n107.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the document which the Tribunal completely failed to consider is a template form, on the third page of **Exhibit C-24**, which was a translation of the 48 Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity. \"Each of those certificates sets out a positive representation that the construction of the solar plant, at issue, conformed with local law. Each representation was specific in that it was made to the special-purpose investment company owning the plant and concerned only the plant that constituted the investment. The municipality of Brindisi reneged on that representation, at a crucial time in the chronology, resulting in the loss of the Claimants\u2019 investments.\"57\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 3.\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimants argue against Italy\u2019s contention that Section C, Part X of the Award, deals with the Legal Instability Claim and the Legitimate Expectations Claim regarding causation, saying that, \"[a]s is clear from its text, paragraph 379 addresses certain DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Mesagne. Those certificates,\" according to the Claimants, \"were not part of any claim of breach or causation pleaded by\" them. The Claimants submit that Italy incorrectly \"asserts that the discussion of these certificates in this paragraph must be read to imply that the Tribunal considered all DIA Certificates of Conformity, including the Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity that served as the basis for the Legitimate Expectations Claim.\" According to the Claimants, they suffered injury from this breach.58\n\nIbid., para. 50.\n\n109.\n\nThe Claimants further contend, in this regard, that paragraph 379 refers to a \"Notice of the Municipality of Mesagne\" and quotes the language from the first page of the PDF of Exhibit C-24, that is, from the five DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Mesagne. However, it is plain that this paragraph does not quote or discusses the language from the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity, issued by the municipality of Brindisi, on the third page of that exhibit.59\n\nIbid., para. 52.\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimants draw attention to the difference between the DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Brindisi and those issued by the municipality of Mesagne by quoting the language used by both.60 Given the emphasis put on this point by the Claimants and its importance for both parties, the Committee quotes verbatim from both certificates:\n\n(i) This activity [construction of the solar plant] is in accordance with the procedures set out in Regional Law n. 31/2008 and with general urban planning instruments.61 (This is the language used by all 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Brindisi.)\n\n(i) Simplified Authorization File Number... is to be regarded as complete [...]. Hence, the aforementioned Simplified Authorization shall become applicable for all intents and purposes [...]62 (Language used by the Mesagne DIAs.)\n\nIbid., paras. 53-54.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 53, citing Exhibit C-24, DIA Certificates of Conformity, p. 3 of PDF (March 5, 2009-May 21, 2010).\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 54, citing Exhibit C-24, DIA Certificates of Conformity, p. 1 of PDF.\n\n111.\n\nThe Claimants contest Italy's argument that the DIA Certificates of Conformity from Mesagne were discussed, by way of example, on paragraph 379 of the Award. They submit that the expression \"by way of example\" has nothing to do with the Tribunal's reasoning. They contend that it is also plain from paragraph 379 that the \"example\" was presented by the Tribunal as being offered by the Claimants, not by the Tribunal.63\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 55. Parenthesis added.\n\n112.\n\nThey also argue that the expression \"they\" in the text of the second sentence of paragraph 379 does not refer to the DIAs as contended by the Respondent, but to the Claimants themselves as mentioned in the first sentence, i.e., \"The Claimants relied on the DIAs as amounting to a definitive authorization for the individual plants. They refer by way of example to a Notice of the Municipality of Mesagne\" (the Mesagne DIA Certificates of Conformity). The language of paragraph 379 of the Award, therefore, does not support Italy's inference that the Tribunal considered not only the Mesagne DIA Certificates of Conformity but must also have reviewed the Brindisi ones.64 They also contend that it would not be rational to cite them, as an example, when the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Brindisi were the only ones on which a claim of breach and causation was founded.65\n\nIbid., para. 56.\n\nIbid., para. 57.\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimants allege that \"the wording of paragraph 379 does not support Italy's suggestion that \u2018the tribunal simply wished to stress how the Claimants had conveniently mischaracterized some of the DIAs in their briefing.'\"66 They argue that paragraph 379 refers not to an assertion in the text of any submission by the Claimants but to a chronology of key events provided as an annex, to the Reply, for the convenience of the Tribunal. The entry, in paragraph 379, referred to **Exhibit C-24**, which aggregated five DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Mesagne municipality (and the template translation on the first page of the Exhibit) and 48 such certificates issued by the Brindisi municipality (and the template translation on the third page of the Exhibit).67\n\nIbid., para. 58, citing Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 44.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 59.\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"[i]t was the Tribunal that in paragraph 379 referred to the template translation of the Mesagne Certificates of Conformity in the exhibit as part of a discussion of causation.... But it had nothing to do with causation or breach, because the municipality of Mesagne took no action inconsistent with the representations in its DIA Certificates of Conformity and the Claimants never presented a claim based on those representations.\"68\n\nIbid., para. 60.\n\n115.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants contend that the \"Tribunal's dismissal of that Claim was founded entirely on the Tribunal's inability to identify in the record a positive representation attributable to the State with respect to the specific investments at issue.\"69 In that regard, the Claimants argue that the second prong of their Legitimate Expectations Claim was based on the indisputably specific representations made concerning the specific investments present in the 48 Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity.70 Thus, the Claimants allege that \"[t]he inapposite discussion of the Mesagne DIA Certificates of Conformity in paragraph 379 can be understood only as confirming that the Tribunal missed the template translation of the 48 Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity a page later in that exhibit.\"71\n\nIbid., para. 64.\n\nIbid., para. 65.\n\nIbid., para. 67.\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimants also contest Italy's contention that the mention of the Mesagne Certificates, at paragraph 379 of the Award, was an *obiter dictum.* The Claimants submit that *obiter dictum* implies that elsewhere the decision states reasons for the holding around which that *dictum* can orbit. There is no such reasoning as concerns the Legitimate Expectations Claim founded on the 48 Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity.72\n\nIbid., para. 68.\n\n117.\n\nAnother element on which the Claimants base their argument against the alleged failure of the Tribunal to consider the DIA Certificates of Conformity, issued by the Municipality of Brindisi, is the distinction between an internationally wrongful act and causation. The Claimants argue that an international wrongful act and causation are two different things. These are separate and independent conditions for reparation which cannot be confused with each other.73 The Claimants submit that considering the expertise of the arbitrators, on this particular subject, it is not possible that they confused the prior notions.74 That is why, in the Claimants' view, the only possible explanation for the lack of analysis in the Award of the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Brindisi municipality is that the Tribunal missed them in the record.75\n\nIbid., para. 70.\n\nIbid., para. 71.\n\nIbid., para. 72.\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that several consequences flow from the Tribunal's alleged failure to consider the Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity.76\n\nIbid., para. 4.\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the first conclusion which can be drawn from it is that the Award lacks any analysis of the document.77 Also, the Claimants recall that Italy noted that in paragraph 379 of the Award, the Tribunal discussed the translation of five different DIA Certificates of Conformity, issued by another municipality, Mesagne. This discussion of different documents appeared in the Award's treatment of causation, not the breach of Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT. No claim of breach or causation, however, was ever based on the Mesagne DIA Certificates of Conformity.78\n\nIbid., para. 5.\n\nIbid., para. 6.\n\n120.\n\nThe second consequence drawn from the Tribunal's alleged failure to consider the Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity, according to the Claimants, is that the failure impacted the Tribunal's reasoning regarding the Legitimate Expectations Claim.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that neither paragraph 379 nor paragraph 165 of the Award considered the DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Brindisi when adjudicating the Legitimate Expectations Claim. Contrary to what Italy contends regarding the discussion by the Tribunal of the Brindisi DIA Certificates, when rejecting the Legitimate Expectations Claim, the Tribunal merely summarized the Claimants' position in this regard. This is made clear by paragraph 165 of the Award. It reads as follows:\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Italian Government made multiple representations \u2018that the construction of specific plants was \"in accordance with the procedures set out in Regional Law n. 31/2008 and with general urban planning instruments.\"' They also argue that for at least two years after having granted the DIA authorizations, the municipality \u2018took no step to suggest that it had any doubt about the validity of the authorizations it had granted.' This, in the Claimants' view, amounted to an implicit representation that gave rise to legitimate expectations. The Claimants further contend that Italy represented, in the Second Energy Account, that it would gradually change the level of feed-in tariffs every two years.79\n\nAward, para. 165. Footnote omitted.\n\n122.\n\nThe Claimants contend that paragraph 165 of the Award does not deal with adjudicating the Legitimate Expectations Claim based on the Brindisi Certificates, for several reasons. First, because paragraph 165 is part of Section VI, titled \"Positions of the Parties on Liability,\" under Heading A titled \"the Claimants\u2019 position\" and sub-heading (b) titled \"Italy's alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\"80 Second, this paragraph includes no review or analysis on the part of the Tribunal itself, but a mere recital of the Claimants\u2019 argument based on **Exhibit C-24**, and in particular on the third page thereof, i.e., the translation of the 48 Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity.81\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 40. Footnote omitted.\n\nIbid., para. 41.\n\n123.\n\nThe Claimants dispute Italy\u2019s contention that Part X of the Award deals with all of the Claimants\u2019 claims on merits, including the Legitimate Expectations Claim in Section B. They submit that Part X, Section B of the Award goes from paragraph 365 to 374, where the Tribunal focused on the Claimants\u2019 position that persons in their position had a Legitimate Expectation that the Third Energy Account would be maintained, for the term envisaged.82 They contend that the Tribunal only addressed the first prong of the Legitimate Expectations Claim, i.e., the argument that the Claimants had legitimate expectations that the regulatory regime for solar projects would remain stable, in part based on representations made to all potential investors in the Second Energy Account.\n\nIbid., para. 43.\n\n124.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Claimants submit that nowhere in Section B of Part X of the Award, did the Tribunal address the second prong of the Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations Claim concerning the representations made by the municipality of Brindisi in the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity. According to the Claimants, these representations were later violated by the Brindisi stop-work order.83.\n\nIbid., para. 45.\n\n**(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------------\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the first sentence of paragraph 379 is sufficient to reject the Claimants\u2019 alleged reading of the Award. The Tribunal dutifully noted the Claimants\u2019 reliance on the DIAs without limiting its remarks to any subset thereof.84\n\nIbid., para. 39.\n\n126.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the first sentence of paragraph 379 referred to the DIAs, and in the absence of any indication to the contrary, it is clear that it referred to all of them, including those issued by the municipality of Brindisi.85\n\nIbid., para. 40.\n\n127.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, after that first sentence, paragraph 379 refers to a Notice of the Municipality of Mesagne, and contains the reasoning, of the Tribunal, \"by way of example.\" In this vein, the Respondent submits that by definition, such wording cannot be taken as a benchmark of the completeness of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning.86\n\nIbid., para. 41.\n\n128.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the mention of the DIAs issued by the Municipality of Mesagne, by way of example, is only because the Tribunal wished to stress how the Claimants had conveniently mischaracterized some of the DIAs in their briefings.87\n\nIbid., para. 44.\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the drafting of paragraph 379 of the Award and mainly the mention of DIAs issued by the Municipality of Mesagne by way of example, is nothing more than an *obiter dictum.88* It also submits that reference to the Mesagne DIAs did not undermine the Award\u2019s reasoning, much less compromise it.89\n\nIbid., para. 50.\n\nIbid., para. 51.\n\n130.\n\nItaly submits that the Claimants, when submitting their reply in the original proceedings, accompanied it with a chronology of key events, indicating, for each listed event, the relevant Exhibit.90\n\nIbid., para. 52.\n\n131.\n\nItaly refers to an entry dated May 21, 2010, where the Claimants referred to the event \"The local development companies obtain the 53d [sic] DIA Certificate of Conformity, stating that the construction of the given solar plants was in accordance with the relevant regulations,\" and it indicated that the document with all DIAs was a supporting document.91 Italy asserts that the Claimants clearly referred to all DIAs, issued both by Mesagne and Brindisi, together, as is evidenced by the reference to the total combined number (53) and the Exhibit that contains both.92 \"Yet, according to this entry, these 53 DIAs stated that the plants were constructed \u2018in accordance with the relevant regulations. *\"*\"93\n\nIbid., para. 53. Footnote omitted.\n\nIbid., para. 55.\n\nIbid., para. 56.\n\n132.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the description is wrong as it mischaracterizes the five DIAs issued by the Municipality of Mesagne \u2014 which are plainly included in the sample but do not fit the description.94\n\nIbid., para. 57.\n\n133.\n\nItaly contends that the Claimants' description of Exhibit C-24 glosses over this distinction and that the Claimants conveniently but inaccurately attached all 53 DIAs under the marginally more positive light of the Brindisi DIAs.95\n\nIbid., para. 60.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the mistake is also made, for example, in paragraph 446 of the Memorial and paragraph 308 of the Reply, which again referred to the whole set of DIAs as pertaining to the Brindisi municipality and all containing the \"in accordance\" language, allegedly amounting to an \"explicit representation.\"96\n\nIbid., para. 61.\n\n135.\n\nItaly contends that the Award's reference to the DIAs issued by Mesagne highlighted a mistake in the Claimants' Memorial and Reply and did not suggest nor imply, *a contrario,* that the Tribunal had failed to \"consider\" or even \"read\" the DIAs issued by the municipality of Brindisi.97\n\nIbid., para. 65.\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent submits that in its view, \"[a]ll DIAs on which the Applicant [sic] allegedly relied were considered by the Tribunal, which found them to be of marginal value \u2014 as they did not provide any reassurance as to the Claimants' plan to receive FITs at a specific rate.\"98\n\nIbid., para. 66.\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent notes that in the Claimants' Reply on Annulment, they took issue with the Respondent's view that the Tribunal had selected the \"example\" and maintained that the Tribunal, instead, referred to the \"example\" selected by the Claimants in their pleadings.99 The Respondent submits that it \"has no trouble accepting this as a possible alternative construction: the text of the Award is ambiguous and accommodates both readings. Yet, nothing changes for the purpose of the Claimants\u2019 case. According to both constructions, the Tribunal expressly acknowledged that the Mesagne Certificates are a sample selected \u2018by way of example\u2019 from a wider set of documents \u2014 most obviously, the entire set collected in document C-24.\"100\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 25.\n\nIbid., para. 26.\n\n138.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Respondent states that the Tribunal did not miss part of C-24 by referring to the Mesagne documents, as an example. The Tribunal expressly alluded to a wider class to which the Mesagne documents belonged, i.e., the entire class of C-24 documents. It included the Brindisi certificates. \"Crucially, since the Brindisi Certificates are the only other documents collected in C-24, the mere mentioning of the Mesagne Certificates by way of example implies \u2014 inescapably \u2014 awareness of the Brindisi\" Certificates.101 As a consequence of the foregoing, the Respondent contends that \"the para-deduction of Claimants (that the Tribunal mentioned the Mesagne Certificates because it had not found the Brindisi ones) is logically untenable, irrespective of whether the Tribunal meant that the \"example\" had been selected by the Tribunal itself or by the Claimants.\"102\n\nIbid., para. 27.\n\nIbid., para. 28.\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants glossed over the Respondent\u2019s explanation of why the Tribunal mentioned the Mesagne DIA Certificates at paragraph 379 of the Award. The Tribunal, quite simply, took the opportunity to highlight an inaccuracy in the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, when it dismissed the relevance of all certificates in establishing any legitimate expectations. The Respondent submits that the Claimants\u2019 pleadings are punctuated with inaccuracies. It quotes from their Reply:\n\nThe Municipality of Brindisi explicitly represented on no less than 53 occasions that the construction of specific plants was \"in accordance with the procedures set out in the Regional Law n. 31/2008 and with general urban planning instruments. [\"]103\n\nIbid., para. 32 citing Reply, para. 308. The text is almost identical to paragraph 446 of the Memorial: \"The Municipality of Brindisi, notably, represented on no less than 53 occasions that the construction of specific plants was \u2018in accordance with the procedures set out in Regional Law n. 31/2008 and with general urban planning instruments.' See also paragraph 152 of the Memorial and paragraph 101 of the Reply, which mistakenly reported that all 53 DIA Certificates confirmed that the permits were in \"accordance with Regional Law n. 31/2008.\"\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent takes issue with this pleading. It submits that this is wrong. Only 48 Brindisi Certificates were submitted with C-24, not 53 or more. Further, not all the 53 Certificates in C-24 are of the \"in accordance\" kind. Only 48 are. They submit that confusion is caused by the Claimants through C-24. It is not caused by either the Respondent or the Tribunal. Moreover, these statements are misleading. These are designed to favor the Claimants. According to the Respondent they inflate the number of the \"in accordance\" certificates from 48 to 53. These mistakes, the Respondent submits, call for public rectification.104\n\nIbid., para. 33.\n\n141.\n\nDerived from the foregoing, according to the Respondent, is the fact that the Tribunal picked up on the Claimants\u2019 misstatements. This is in and of itself sufficient evidence that the Tribunal was familiar with the contents of C-24, otherwise, it would have taken the erroneous 53-Brindisi-Certificates and the 53-compliance-certificates stories at face value.105\n\nIbid., para. 34.\n\n142.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal was aware that the Legitimate Expectations Claim relating to the stop-work order concerned only the Brindisi Certificates. This, according to the Respondent, \"emerges from the Tribunal-made interpolation in a quote from the Claimants\u2019 own pleadings.\"\n\nClaimants assert that the stop-work order \"was contrary to the very regional law with which [the municipality of Brindisi] had previously certified [the construction of the solar plant\u2019s] compliance.\"106\n\nIbid., para. 35, citing Award, para. 167.\n\n143.\n\nItaly contends that \"the wording chosen by the Tribunal to synthesise the position of the Claimants, and in particular the intervention between square brackets, demonstrate [sic] that the Tribunal was aware of the relevance of the Brindisi Certificates and that the stop-work episode related to them, rather than to the Mesagne Certificates.\"107\n\nIbid., para. 36.\n\n144.\n\nUltimately, Italy argues that \"the appearance of the Mesagne Certificates in paragraph 379 of the Award is not an indication of the Tribunal\u2019s negligence, but of the Claimants\u2019 mistakes.\"108\n\nIbid., para. 45.\n\n**VI. OVERVIEW OF THE MATTERS BEFORE THE** ***AD HOC*** **COMMITTEE**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nIn this annulment proceeding, this Committee must decide upon the Claimants\u2019 request for annulment and the Respondent\u2019s request to terminate the proceeding. The first task assigned to this Committee was the Application for Annulment. The Committee will, therefore, treat each of these requests in turn.\n\n**VII. GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT UNDER ARTICLE 52(1) OF THE ICSID CONVENTION**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nThe Committee observes that the Claimants raise three grounds for annulment due to the same alleged omission, each ground is different and independent; hence the Committee will analyze each of these three grounds.\n\n**A. Scope of the Annulment**\n-----------------------------\n\n147.\n\nThis Committee will begin by examining the scope of annulment set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention before analyzing the merits of the Application for Annulment.\n\n148.\n\nThe common elements identified by previous *ad hoc* committees are, *inter alia,* the following:\n\n- The annulment is not an appeal\n\nIt bears reiterating that an *ad hoc* committee is not a court of appeal.109\n\nIt is important to note, at this juncture, that within the ICSID system of Arbitration there is no appeal or any other remedy against an award except those provided for in the CONVENTION.110\n\n- The *ad hoc* committee has discretion\n\nAn *Ad Hoc* Committee retains a measure of discretion in its ruling on applications for annulment. This is clearly implied in the CONVENTION through the use of terms, such as \"manifest,\" \"serious\" and \"fundamental\". This discretion is not unlimited and should not be exercised to the point of defeating the object and purpose of the remedy of annulment. The Ad Hoc Committee may refuse to exercise its authority to annul an Award if and when annulment is clearly not needed to remedy procedural injustice and annulment would unwarrantably erode the binding force and finality of ICSID Awards.111\n\n- The task of an *ad hoc* committee is limited\n\nAn Ad Hoc Committee, in annulment proceedings, is not entitled to decide which one of several possible interpretations of an annulment decision, among which the Tribunal could choose, was preferable. It has simply to ascertain whether the Tribunal whose award is challenged acted in manifest breach of its competence.112\n\n- The *ad hoc* committees have the task to \"protect the integrity of the system\"\n\nThe role of an *ad hoc* committee is to ensure the stability of the ICSID arbitration system, not to overthrow awards because of its disagreement with the arbitral tribunal. Otherwise, the annulment mechanism of Article 52 would slide into an appeal.113\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal SA. v.

United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, para. 23, Legal Authority CL-261 *(\"Soufraki\").*\n\n149.\n\nThe exceptional character of annulment proceedings is confirmed by the decision of the *ad hoc* committees. As the Respondent pointed out in \"[o]nly 8 times out of the 50 attempts until 2016\"114 was the applicant successful.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, footnote 40.\n\n**B. The core element in this Application for Annulment**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nThe fundamental issue raised by the Claimants is that the Tribunal erred by not considering and addressing the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Brindisi, contained in Exhibit C-24,115 when considering the Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectation Claim. Such omission, according to the Claimants, had a direct impact on such claim.116\n\nExhibit C-24, contains 57 pages. The first is an English non-official translation of a template of the certificates of conformity (DIA) of the municipality of Mesagne. The second page is blank. The third page contains an English non-official translation of a template of the certificates of conformity (DIA) of the municipality of Brindisi. Following, these are 53 numbered pages in Italian. Pages 1 through 47, 49 and 51 through 53 are copies of Italian certificates issued by the Municipality of Brindisi. Pages 48 and 50 are copies of Italian certificates issued by the Municipality of Mesagne.\n\n\"[T]he Tribunal inexplicably failed to consider measures at the heart of one of the claims and on which the other claims relied in important part\" (Memorial on Annulment, para. 2); \"[t]he omission... concerns measures central to... the Legitimate Expectations Claim\" (Memorial on Annulment, para. 5); \"the Tribunal disregarded the DIA Certificates of Conformity in its analysis of the Legitimate Expectations Claim\" (Memorial on Annulment, para. 32); \"Yet, surprisingly, the Tribunal did not discuss the DIA Certificates of Conformity *at all* in this section [Section B. Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment]. None of the 48 certificates from the municipality of Brindisi or the five certificates from the municipality of Mesagne is mentioned\" (Memorial on Annulment, para. 66); \"the Award's shortcomings \u2014 fundamentally, its complete failure to deal with the DIA Certificates of Conformity in the section of the Award addressing the Legitimate Expectations Claim\" (Memorial on Annulment, para. 100); \"It is based on a fundamental procedural mistake made by the Tribunal, i.e. failing to read one-page document central to the second prong of the Claimants' Legitimate Expectations Claim\" (Reply on Annulment, para. 2) \"The first and most obvious consequence is that the Award lacks any analysis of the document\" (Reply on Annulment, para. 5); \"the issue is the Tribunal's failure to consider a key part of the Claimants' evidence and, therefore, address a claim based on that evidence\" (Reply on Annulment, para. 149); \"This case concerns a single failure of an award to address an important claim\" (Tr. Day 2, 6:15-16).\n\n151.\n\nIn the words of the Claimants, \"the question presented is one of the Tribunal failing to consider a key element of a party's case.\"117 The grounds for Annulment are based precisely on that issue. Accordingly, the first task of this Committee is to determine whether the Award did or did not address the Brindisi DIAs.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 8.\n\n152.\n\nThe second issue argued by Claimants \"concerns the impact of the Tribunal's error on the outcome of the case.\"118 The second issue will arise for consideration only if this Committee concludes that the Brindisi DIAs were not discussed in the Award.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 77.\n\n**a. Analysis of the core element**\n-----------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nThe Claimants acknowledge that the Award described the DIA Certificates of Conformity and their functioning:\n\n- \"The DIA procedure is correctly described in Section IV.C.1. of the Award\":119\n\n- \"the Tribunal correctly understood that the DIA Certificates of Conformity were at the heart of the Claimants' Legitimate Expectations Claim\";120\n\n- \"The Tribunal also correctly understood one of the Claimants\u2019 two bases of its Legitimate Expectations Claim, i.e. the expectations that legitimately arose from the DIA Certificates of Conformity and which were later dashed by measures adopted by the municipality of Brindisi\";121\n\n- \"The Tribunal therefore correctly recalled, at paragraph 165 of the Award, that:\n\n...the Italian Government made multiple representations \u2018that the construction of specific plans was \"in accordance with the procedures set out in Regional Law n. 31/2018 and with the general urban planning instruments\"\u2019\";122\n\n- \"The Tribunal also correctly referenced in that footnote the Claimants\u2019 factual exhibit upon which they based their assertion, Exhibit C-24\";123\n\n- \"... the Tribunal again correctly recalled the Claimants\u2019 argument that:\n\n[F]or at least two years after having granted the DIA authorisations, the municipality \u2018took no step to suggest that it had any doubt about the validity of the authorizations it had granted\u2019\";124\n\n- \"The Tribunal also correctly recalled... the Claimants\u2019 argument that \u2018[t]his, in the Claimants\u2019 view, amounted to an implicit representation that gave rise to legitimate expectations.\u2019\"125\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 17, citing the following paragraphs of the Award: 66, 67, 68, and 71.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 30.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 54. The footnote 63 to paragraph 54 refences, *inter alia,* to paragraph 165 of the Award which reads as follows: \"the Italian Government made multiple representations \u2018that the construction of specific plans was \"in accordance with the procedures set out in Regional Law n. 31/2018 and with the general urban planning instruments.\"\"\"\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 57.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 58.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 60.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 61.\n\n154.\n\nIn this Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal referred to the DIA Certificates issued by the Municipality of Mesagne only as an example of the contents and scope of these Certificates and the promises, if any, incorporated in them. This example does not establish that the Tribunal was either unaware of or failed to consider the Brindisi DIA Certificates. This Committee is of the view that the Tribunal considered the entire class of C-24 documents. It was not required to and did not commit an error by not discussing each DIA Certificate individually. It was not required to divide them so or to discuss them separately, as suggested by the Claimants. It performed its function adequately by looking at the entire set of documents together and concluding that these could not provide the basis for an award in favor of the Claimants.\n\n155.\n\nIn light of the above, this Committee is of the view that the DIA Certificates of Conformity and their functioning were addressed in the Award.\n\n156.\n\nThe above conclusion is also supported by fact that Claimants themselves recognized that \"the Tribunal reviewed each of the Claimants\u2019 three separate claims, one by one.\"126\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 63.\n\n**b. Structure and functioning of the Award**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nAt the outset, this Committee recognizes that an award is the result of a lengthy process which amalgamates and summarizes many elements. Each piece of the Award is intertwined. For this reason, the Award should be read carefully and holistically. Nothing prevents a tribunal from crafting an award in the manner that such tribunal considers the best way to shed light on the claims and arguments.\n\n**i. Claims under ECT Article 10(1)**\n-------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nArticle 10(1) of the ECT states:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.\n\n159.\n\nRegarding the merits on ECT Article 10(1), the Tribunal, in its Award, stated that the Claimants\u2019 second claim relating to \"legitimate expectations argument is thus *a frank alternative* to its more nuanced argument based on degree of legislative change,\"127 and that \"Claimants present an *alternative* formulation of an Article 10(1) claim based essentially on legitimate expectations.\"128 In this vein, the Award addressed the main issues regarding Article 10 in Section X.A, which is more elaborate than Section X.B. It covered the measures in a broader way, although not in a disconnected fashion, and finally discussed the causation part in Section X.C.\n\nAward, para. 366. Emphasis added.\n\nAward, para. 365. Emphasis added.\n\n160.\n\nThe Tribunal saw the second claim as a \"more nuanced argument based on degree of legislative claim,\"129 and, based on such reading, considered that it was not necessary to revisit the issue in Section X.B. This understanding of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning indicates a close relationship between claims under ECT Article 10(1).\n\nAward, para. 366. Emphasis added.\n\n161.\n\nIn Section X.A, The Legal Instability Claim: ECT Article 10(1), subsection 1, The interpretation of Article 10(1), the Tribunal referred to the second sentence of such article:\n\nIn effect, as various tribunals have pointed out, the obligation to create stable conditions is conceived as part of the FET standard which is generally applicable to investments by virtue of the second sentence. The Respondent in effect agrees:\n\nthe obligation of FET... already contains the requirements of stability and transparency of the treatment. The FET standard represents the mandatory specification of the general provision contained in the first sentence. On the other hand, it is not clear which state conduct could be considered lawful on the basis of the FET standard and unlawful on the basis of Art. 10.1 first sentence.\n\n162.\n\nOn the basis that Article10(1), first and second sentences, of the ECT apply to a \u2018legal instability\u2019 claim said to arise in the course of an existing investment, the next question is the scope of the host state\u2019s obligation in that regard.130\n\nAward, paras. 315-316. Footnotes omitted. Emphasis added.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that the disputing parties saw such close relationship:\n\n\"the Respondent further argues that \u2018[i]f it is true that the second sentence [of Article 10(1)] is strictly related to the first, this does not prevent the second sentence from having a different normative force, that is being specifically binding and directly enforceable by the investor.'\"131\n\nAward, footnote 276.\n\n164.\n\nIn Section X.A of the Award, the Tribunal not only addressed the first sentence of Article 10(1), but also addressed other sentences, in particular the second sentence:\n\n(1) The five sentences of Article 10(1) embody commitments towards investments, in accordance with their terms...\n\n(3) But the core commitment is that in the second sentence, expressly included in the first, \u2018to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment'....132\n\nIn applying to the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account the standard of legal stability incorporated in Article 10(1), first and second sentence, of the ECT (paragraph 319 above).133\n\nthe fair and equitable treatment standard which, by virtue of the second sentence, is at the core of the obligation of stability under the first sentence has a relatively high threshold.134\n\nAward, para. 319. Emphasis added.\n\nAward, para. 342. Emphasis added.\n\nAward, para. 363. Emphasis added.\n\n165.\n\nTurning to the core of the Application for Annulment, this Committee observes that the Tribunal analyzed the measures described in a broader manner in the Award (paras. 321 *et seq.).* These are interrelated to broader and more comprehensive measures, i.e. the Constitutional Court Decision, the Romani Decree and the Fourth Energy Account, and the Brindisi stop-work. All these are intertwined and related and/or have an impact on the DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Brindisi Municipality.\n\n166.\n\nThe Claimants argued that the claim regarding the second sentence referred to the construction of the plants and not to the FITs. At paragraph 351 (*et seq.* of the Award's Section X.A, the Tribunal refers precisely to the construction:\n\nThe Claimants argue that the stop-work order was the final blow to the Project, preventing the construction even of the two projected plants by the deadline laid down in the Fourth Energy Account and thereby ensuring the bankruptcy of the project companies.135\n\nAward, para. 351. Emphasis added. The subsequent paragraphs of the Award refer to the construction of the plants.\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal also analyzed the failure of the Project due to the stop-work episode.136\n\nSee Award, paras. 358-360.\n\n168.\n\nThe Award addressed the issue of legitimate expectations arising from the DIA:\n\nThe Claimants emphasise the due diligence done on the Project, in particular through the Preliminary Due Diligence Report. They go on to assert that \u2018[t]he report identified no particular issue with respect either to the construction and connection authorizations held by the companies...\u2019 But this is not the case : the Preliminary Report focuses perhaps more on this potential problem than any other. Moreover, a due diligence exercise (and this one was avowedly incomplete) is or should be carried out for the client prior to the investment; it does not shift any risk to the state. Nor could it form the basis for a legitimate expectation vis-\u00e0-vis the state that the DIA \u2018authorizations\u2019 were secure against challenge.137\n\nAward, para. 383. Emphasis added.\n\n169.\n\nIn the opinion of this Committee, these findings relate to the legitimate expectations claim and cover the DIA authorizations issued by the Brindisi as well as the Mesagne municipalities.\n\n170.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that, as explained above, the Award made a general determination on the claims under Article 10(1). The following quote illustrates the point:\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants have not discharged the onus of proof of establishing that the Italian state\u2019s measures were the operative cause of the Puglia Project\u2019s failure. Of far greater weight was the continued dependence on project financing, and the failure to obtain it was due both to the size of the Project and to justified concerns about the scope of DIA authorisation, on which the legality of the Project depended. That being so, the claim under Article 10(1) for loss of the Project would fail in any event.138\n\nAward, para. 394. Emphasis added.\n\n171.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the general conclusion covers (1) the claim under Article 10(1), even if this is just a \"claim,\" and not \"claims,\" as suggested. It could be explained in light of the Tribunal\u2019s view, that the second sentence was a \"legitimate expectations argument is thus *a frank alternative* to its more nuanced argument based on degree of legislative change\";139 and (2) the DIA authorization scheme either under the Brindisi or Mesagne municipalities.\n\nAward, para. 366. Emphasis added.\n\n172.\n\nWith regard to ECT Article 10(1), the Tribunal developed its analysis in Section C with the Issue of Causation in Part X, *The Merits: The Tribunal\u2019s Appreciation.* The first paragraph of this section reads:\n\nCentral to the Claimants\u2019 case as pleaded under Article 10(1) is a claim of fact - viz., that the real reason for the complete failure of the Project was the legal instability in Italy arising from a series of events... But even if all (or some of them) constituted breaches of the ECT, if they did not cause the failure of the Project, the Claimants cannot recover.627\n\n627 For the requirement of causation as a condition for a claim of breach of an obligation, see ILC Articles on State Responsibility, 2001, Exhibit CL-4, Art. 31 and commentary.140\n\nAward, para. 375.\n\n173.\n\nAfter such introduction, the Tribunal extensively analyzed the DIA Certificates of Conformity in Section X.C.\n\n**c. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Committee in *TECO* correctly recognized that \"a tribunal cannot be required to address within its award each and every piece of evidence,\"141 and the Committee in *Suez* found that \"it is not for an *ad hoc* committee... to determine whether the Tribunal assessed each and every piece of evidence that the Parties considered relevant to their case.\"142 Finally, in the context of the subparagraph (e) of Article 51 the Committee in *Enron* observed that:\n\n... the tribunal is required only to give reasons for its decision in respect of each of the *questions.* This requires the tribunal to state its pertinent findings of fact, its pertinent findings as to the applicable legal principles, and its conclusions in respect of the application of the law to the facts. If the tribunal has done this, the award will not be annulled on the basis that the tribunal could have given more detailed reasons and analysis for its findings of fact or law, or that the tribunal did not expressly state its evaluation in respect to each individual item of evidence or each individual legal authority or legal provision relied upon by the parties, or\n\ndid not expressly state a view on every single legal and factual issue raised by the parties in the course of the proceedings. The tribunal is required to state reasons for its *decision,* but not necessarily reasons for its *reasons.*143\n\n*TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC v.

Emphasis added.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal, in this case, addressed Exhibit C-24 as mentioned *supra.* The Claimants\u2019 complaint is not that the Award did not address it but that the Award did not address it in the section the Claimants consider more appropriate.\n\n176.\n\nThis Committee finds that the Award analyzed the claims and the evidence \u2014 including Exhibit C-24 \u2014 in a coherent and not in a segmented manner. The Tribunal did not omit consideration of any issue or any material evidence although the measures alleged to be contrary to the ECT Article 10(1) were interrelated, contained different pieces and some of them operated in an integrated manner. The complete analysis is developed in Part X of the Award through its three different Sections.\n\n177.\n\nIn the view of the Committee, the Claimants\u2019 complaint is in essence not about an omission to consider pivotal evidence but about the weight the Tribunal gave to such evidence, i.e., Exhibit C-24.144\n\nSee for example Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 163 (\"What transpires from the Award, if anything, is the Tribunal\u2019s lack of conviction regarding the alleged value of the DIAs issued from the municipality of Brindisi\"); para. 193 (\"Claimants, in their submissions, invoke instead a (very much alleged) error *in judicando.* They asserted that the Tribunal has mistakenly given insufficient weight to the Brindisi DIAs.\")\n\n178.\n\nIn view of the above discussion, the answer to the question \u2014 whether the Tribunal has considered a key element of a party\u2019s case, i.e., 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity \u2014 is in the affirmative\u2019. This Committee will, therefore, now turn to address each of the grounds of annulment.\n\n**C. Article 52(1)(e): The Tribunal Failed to State Reasons on Which the Award is Based**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimants begin by addressing the legal standards applicable to Annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. According to them Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"[t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\" They submit that a violation of this duty is a ground for annulment of the award.145\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 76.\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimants argue that this ground for annulment is designed to protect *\"the integrity of the award* \u2014 meaning that the reasoning presented in the award should be coherent and not contradictory, so as to be understandable by the Parties and must reasonably support the solution adopted by the tribunal (Article 52(1)(e)).\"146\n\nIbid., para. 77, citing *Soufraki,* para. 23, Legal Authority CL-261.\n\n181.\n\nIn support of the legal standard applicable to Annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the Claimants cite the *TECO ad hoc* Committee, as follows:\n\n[T]he requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.147\n\nIbid., para. 78, citing *Maritime Int\u2019l Nominees Establishment (MINE) v.

See also *Enron,* para. 384, Legal Authority CL-265.\n\n183.\n\nThey also cite part of the reasoning of *Wena Hotels ad hoc* Committee, in this regard. The *ad hoc* committee, in that case, decided that annulment will be justified if \"the Tribunal failed to observe evidence which at least had the potential to be relevant to the final outcome of the case.\"149\n\nIbid., para. 80, citing *TECO,* para. 135, Legal Authority CL-272. Emphasis added.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants also cite another part of the reasoning of the *TECO ad hoc* Committee, where that Committee partially annulled the award on the ground of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. The *TECO* Committee took \"issue with the complete absence of any discussion of the Parties' expert reports within the Tribunal's analysis of the loss of value claim.\" In the *TECO* Committee's words:\n\nWhile the Committee accepts that a tribunal cannot be required to address within its award each and every piece of evidence in the record, that cannot be construed to mean that a tribunal can simply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, without any analysis and without explaining why it found that evidence insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory.150\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 81, citing ibid., para. 137 (\"The Committee is therefore left guessing as to the Tribunal\u2019s actual line of reasoning, which cannot be ascertained from the rest of the Tribunal's analysis either.\"); Ibid., para. 131. See also ibid., para. 130 (\"[T]he Tribunal did not discuss *at all* the Parties\u2019 respective expert reports...\"). Emphasis in original.\n\n185.\n\nThe Claimants contend that as a consequence of the foregoing \"[a] tribunal is duty bound to the parties to at least address those pieces of evidence that the parties deem to be highly relevant to their case[\u2026]\"151\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 82. Footnote omitted.\n\n186.\n\nAfter setting out the legal standards applicable to annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Conventions, the Claimants apply those legal standards to the Award in this case.152\n\nIbid., para. 98.\n\n187.\n\nThe Claimants allege that nowhere did the Tribunal address the DIA Certificates issued by the Municipality of Brindisi in its analysis of the Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations Claim. As such, the Tribunal failed to state reasons on which the Award is based. The following arguments are advanced by the Claimants to support this contention.\n\n1. The Tribunal Nowhere Addressed the Certificates of Conformity in Its Analysis of the Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations Claim and, as Such, Failed to State Any Reasons for Dismissing This Claim153\n\nIbid., para. 101, citing See e.g., Award, para.165 & n. 257 (citing among others Exhibit C-24) (Tab A).\n\n188.\n\nThey argue that in Section X.B of the Award, entitled \"Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard: ECT Article 10(1), second sentence (legitimate expectations),\" the Tribunal didn\u2019t address the DIA Certificates of Conformity that appeared at Exhibit C-24 either.154 The only question the Tribunal addressed in Section X.B of the Award is whether the Claimants had a legitimate expectation that the Third Energy Account \"would be maintained for the term envisaged.\"155\n\nIbid., para. 102, citing Award paras. 365-74 (Tab A).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 103, citing Ibid., para. 365 (Tab A).\n\n189.\n\nThe Claimants recalled that their Legitimate Expectations Claim was divided into two prongs. The first prong related to legitimate expectations based on the Third Energy Account, while the second prong related to legitimate expectations based on the DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by Brindisi. They also recalled that the Tribunal correctly understood the difference between the two prongs of the Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations Claim and had no confusion about them.156\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 104. Footnote omitted.\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimants contend that \"focusing on the Third Energy Account to the exclusion of the DIA Certificates of Conformity led the Tribunal to make findings regarding the lack of \u2018specificity\u2019 vis-\u00e0-vis any given investor of a decree of general application such as the Third Energy Account. The Tribunal contrasted it with the specificity required, in its view, for a finding of breach of representations made to investors, creating legitimate expectations, in the context of Article 10(1), second sentence, of the ECT.\"157\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 105, citing See Award, paras. 365-74 (Tab A).\n\n191.\n\nAs a consequence of the findings of the Tribunal regarding the lack of specificity, the Claimants contend that \"[h]ad the Tribunal analyzed the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity from the municipality of Brindisi as part of its adjudication of the Legitimate Expectations Claim \u2014 which it had implicitly announced it would do, because it had correctly recalled the Claimants\u2019 argument in respect of this claim \u2014 the Tribunal would necessarily have observed that these DIA Certificates of Conformity could hardly be more specific to the Claimants\u2019 investments, because the only topic each DIA Certificate of Conformity addressed was the construction of a particular solar plant (which the Claimants were to finance) on a specific parcel of land (which the Claimants acquired).\"158\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 106.\n\n192.\n\nThey argue that they had anticipated this situation, so they addressed it as part of their closing submissions at the hearing, highlighting the fact that Italy made \"specific\" commitments.159 However, the Claimants argue that the analysis of the specific representation in the DIA Certificates of Conformity, which would logically follow from the Tribunal\u2019s approach to \"specificity,\" is completely absent in the Award, and without any reason.\n\nIbid., para. 107, citing Claimants' Closing Statement, which can be found at Tab M of the procedural documents from the arbitration.\n\n193.\n\nThe Claimants contend that as a consequence of the foregoing, the Tribunal omitted to review and, thus, to adjudicate the Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations Claim, to the extent, that this claim related to the DIA Certificates of Conformity.160 They contend that \"such omission had a direct bearing on the outcome of the case, given that those certificates contained specific representations by the municipality of Brindisi, on which the Claimants relied in making the bulk of their investment, and which the municipality subsequently reneged on (when initiating the self-redress proceedings and adopting the stop-work order).\"161\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 110.\n\nIbid., para. 111.\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimants contest Italy\u2019s argument that the Tribunal addressed the DIA Certificates of Conformity from Brindisi when rejecting the Legitimate Expectations Claim.\n\n195.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Tribunal solely focused on the first page of the PDF of **Exhibit C-24**, which is a template translation of the five Certificates of Conformity, issued by the municipality of Mesagne. According to them, \"the Tribunal completely failed to consider the 48 Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Brindisi, and their template translation displayed on the third page of the PDF of **Exhibit C-24**.\"162\n\nIbid., para. 114.\n\n196.\n\nThe Claimants contend that \"three aspects of the record place this omission into context. First, the vast majority of the plants in the Claimants\u2019 project, were located in Brindisi, and **Exhibit C-24** primarily consisted of the 48 certificates from the municipality of Brindisi reproduced in that exhibit.\"163 \"Second, only the municipality of Brindisi adopted measures culminating in the stop-work order that violated the expectations that had legitimately arisen from the Certificates of Conformity issued by that municipality. The municipality of Mesagne at no point questioned the validity of the construction permits it had granted, and the Legitimate Expectations Claim addressed only measures by the municipality of Brindisi, not Mesagne.\"164 \"Third, the texts of the Certificates of Conformity issued by the respective municipalities were different,\"165 as noted before.166 \"The Tribunal correctly observed that the Mesagne municipality\u2019s certificates did not contain the key text found in the Brindisi municipality\u2019s certificates that the Claimants relied on in making their investment and repeatedly quoted in their submissions. However, that observation is of no consequence because only the municipality of Brindisi was alleged to have contradicted explicit representations by adopting measures diametrically opposed to the specific representations made in the certificates it had issued.\"167\n\nIbid., para. 115.\n\nIbid., para. 116.\n\nIbid., para. 117.\n\nSee *supra* para. 119.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 117.\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimants further contend that \"[t]he Tribunal not only did not address the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Brindisi prominently featuring in **Exhibit C-24** but it also failed to state any reasons for disregarding them. It appears that the Tribunal only read the first page of a 53-page long exhibit, as if the exhibit had included only one template translation of the DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Mesagne on page 1 of the PDF and not a second page consisting in the template translation of the municipality of Brindisi on page 3 of the PDF.\"168\n\nIbid., para. 118.\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they \"have discharged their burden of proof based on Article 52(1)(d), because it is plain that the Tribunal implicitly announced at paragraph 165 of the Award that the question of the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Brindisi municipality was important for the Claimants and for the Tribunal itself. Yet, the Tribunal nowhere analyzes, in the Award, the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Brindisi municipality and on which the second prong of the Legitimate Expectations Claim was based.\"169\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 153.\n\n199.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that because of the evidence overlooked by the Tribunal, it is impossible to follow the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning \"from Point A to Point B\" to recall the standard of the *MINE ad hoc* committee.170\n\nIbid., para. 154, citing *MINE,* para. 5.09, Legal Authority CL-257; Memorial on Annulment, paras. 78, 101-121.\n\n200.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"Italy misses the mark with its separate assertion that \u2018[a] tribunal\u2019s failure to address a specific question does not render the resulting award annullable as such.\u2019\"171 Furthermore, the Claimants contend that by doing so, Italy relies on the history of the ICSID Convention and the fact that \"the ICSID Convention provides another remedy where a Tribunal fails to address a question: the dissatisfied party may request that the same Tribunal issue a supplementary decision [under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention] concerning the question not addressed.\"172\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 155, citing Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 88. Footnote omitted.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 156, citing ICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID,* May 5, 2016, para. 103, Legal Authority ARL-19. Footnote omitted.\n\n201.\n\nRegarding the remedy of supplementary decision, the Claimants submit that \"ICSID jurisprudence has rejected the notion that Article 49(2)\u2019s provision for a supplemental decision provides the exclusive remedy, or a remedy that must be exhausted, when an award fails to address a question. Summarizing this jurisprudence, Schreuer, Malintoppi, Reinisch and Sinclair state in their treatise on ICSID practice as follows:\n\nThis case law on Art. 49(2) confirms the limited relevance of the remedy of supplementation. It is useful for unintentional omissions of a technical nature... It is not a sufficient remedy for a failure to address major facts and arguments which go to the core of the tribunal\u2019s decision. In the latter case, a party must seek annulment if it can demonstrate one of the grounds listed in Art. 52(1). The *Wena Hotels* Committee observed that \u2018the ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) includes therefore the case where the Tribunal omitted to decide upon a question submitted to it to the extent such supplemental decision may affect the reasoning supporting the Award.\u2019 In that case a prior exhaustion of the lesser remedy of supplementation under Art. 49(2) is not necessary.\"173\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 157, citing Christoph H. Schreuer et al., *The ICSID Convention\u2014A Commentary,* p. 864, Legal Authority CL-279 (quoting *Wena Hotels,* para. 101, Legal Authority CL-258). Footnote omitted.\n\n202.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the problem in this case is different. It is that the Tribunal failed to review the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the Brindisi municipality. This was in spite of the fact, according to the Claimants, that the Tribunal had itself implicitly announced, in paragraph 165, that it would review these to properly adjudicate the second prong of the Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations Claim.174 As a consequence, they claim, that the problem in the present case is not simply that the Tribunal failed to address \"a question,\" which was one among many other questions.175 According to the Claimants, the question that the Tribunal failed to address, that of the 48 Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity, was the only question that was at the heart of the second prong of the Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations Claim.176 They also submit that the Tribunal also did not fail to address that question because it deemed it unimportant or irrelevant. It is clear from paragraph 165 of the Award, among others, that the Tribunal realized that this question was important. It simply failed to address it in the Award because it failed to locate in the record, the template translation of the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Brindisi at the third page of the PDF in Exhibit C-24.177\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 159.\n\nIbid., para. 160.\n\nIbid., para. 161.\n\nIbid., para. 162.\n\n203.\n\nThe Claimants note that the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment (the \"**Background Paper**\") cites the *TECO* annulment decision\u2019s finding that \"the failure to address certain evidence relevant to the determination of damages amounted to a failure to state the reasons.\" They submit that \"Italy itself draws the Committee\u2019s attention to this decision, noting that the award in that case was partially annulled because \u2018the tribunal had not explained why it had bypassed and substantially ignored the evidence provided by the parties about [a specific] claim.\u2019\"178\n\nIbid., para. 164, citing *TECO,* paras. 123-139, Legal Authority CL-272; see Counter-Memorial on Annulment, paras. 90-92.\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"the Tribunal failed to explain why it \u2018bypassed\u2019 and \u2018substantially ignored the evidence\u2019 provided at the third page of Exhibit C-24 (i.e., the 48 Brindisi DIA Certificates of Conformity).\"179\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 165.\n\n205.\n\nThe Claimants allege that because of all of these arguments, the Tribunal\u2019s omissions rendered its reasoning on the Legitimate Expectations Claim impossible to understand. That \"[i]n sum, the absence of any analysis of the DIA Certificates of Conformity in the section of the Award addressing the Legitimate Expectations Claim, and the failure to deal with the relevant DIA Certificates of Conformity (those of Brindisi) reproduced in **Exhibit C-24** in the Award\u2019s section on causation, is a failure to state reasons.

It cites *MINE:*\n\nthe requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph (1)(e) [Article 52], because it almost inevitably draws an *ad hoc* Committee into an examination of the substance of the tribunal\u2019s decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of appeal by Article 53 of the Convention.181\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 78.\n\n207.\n\nThe Respondent argues that an award warrants annulment if it does not enable the reader to follow and understand its reasoning.182\n\nIbid., para. 82, citing *Total SA. v.

The DIAs clearly could not fulfil that function.196\n\nIbid., para. 102, citing Award, para. 380.\n\n215.\n\nIn addition, Italy contends that \"immediately after referring to the Claimants\u2019 alleged reliance on the DIAs, the Tribunal cut to the bone of the Legitimate Expectations Claim:\n\n[a]t no stage did the Claimants obtain unconditional assurances from the central Government as to their plants' entitlement to FITs, or to the level of such FITs.197\n\nIbid., para. 103; and Award paras. 379-380.\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondent, in support of this contention, argues that \"the Claimants had only suffered from a very circumscribed incident with respect to the exercise of that right: the stop-work order that, in January 2012, blocked the construction works for two days with respect to two plants.\" These were two plants out of 120 that were never even commenced.198 According to the Respondent, thus, \"the Claimants' assertion advanced in the Memorial that Italy's actions relating to the two plants in Brindisi \u2018frustrated the project in its entirety' is ostensibly an exaggeration.\"199\n\nIbid., para. 105.\n\nIbid., para. 106, citing Memorial, para. 452.\n\n217.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that \"the Tribunal attributed the failure of the Claimants' project to its inherent financial and regulatory risks. The dubious legality of the DIAs was one of them: the risk was ultimately overcome, but could not be discounted or minimised. The Claimants could not harbor a legitimate expectation that there would be no glitch in that regard.\"200 Italy further contends that these regulatory risks, when they surfaced, were effectively overcome by the efficient system of judicial review administered by the Italian courts. The Claimants, according to the Respondent, suffered what was perhaps a minor setback in the construction schedule. The Respondent submits that the Claimants' expectation that construction would steer clear of any minor bump in the road was not legitimate. The more plausible expectation of having the right to build the plants was indeed met by Italy's actions.201\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 54.\n\nIbid., para. 55.\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that the Claimants criticized the Tribunal's reading of the due diligence report, which they said would have been more approving had the arbitrators considered the Brindisi DIA Certificates, as the Claimants' consultants had when they prepared it.202\n\nIbid., para. 60, citing Reply on Annulment, para. 83.\n\n219.\n\nThe Respondent contends that \"the zoom-in on the due diligence report deliberately neglected to mention that both the Brindisi Certificates and the due diligence report had been submitted to several potential funders, partners and lenders, all of which gave the Claimants a cold shoulder. In other words,\" Italy submits, \"if really the combination of the Brindisi Certificates and the subsequent due diligence report should have dispelled all regulatory risks \u2014 something that the Claimants asserted \u2014 it becomes inexplicable why the construction project attracted no interest.\" According to Italy, \"the Claimants found themselves trying to build a tiny portion of the project without external funding, in a last ditch-effort to avoid the application of Romani Decree to their plans. This scenario does not speak highly of the project's popularity and the Tribunal's alleged failure to read the Brindisi Certificates, therefore, had nothing to do with it.\"203\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 62.\n\n220.\n\nNow, regarding the stop-work order, which in the Claimants' views was the final blow to the project,204 the Respondent cites a part of the reasoning of the Tribunal in this regard, which is as follows:\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the stop-work episode did not involve any breach of the ECT. Nor (for that matter) was it a function of \u2018legal instability.'...205\n\nIbid., para. 64.\n\nIbid., para. 64, citing Award para. 357. Footnotes omitted.\n\n221.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent submits that \"[e]vidently, the Tribunal recognised that the stop-work order's illegality under Italian law was remedied quickly and effectively and could not give rise to any ECT breach. The Claimants' entire fantasy about the \u2018smoking gun' effect of the Brindisi Certificates cannot be entertained [for] it boils down to a simple refusal to accept that the Tribunal attributed to them a much lower evidentiary weight than the Claimants would now want them to have.\"206\n\nIbid., para. 66.\n\n222.\n\nItaly notes that another of the Claimants' arguments, in favor of the importance of the DIA Certificates of Conformity from Brindisi for their Legitimate Expectations Claim, is related to land use regulations. On this particular subject, the Respondent alleges that after the Tribunal rejected the Legitimate Expectations Claim stating that the Claimants had no legitimate expectations in the FITs that phased out prematurely,207 the Claimants attempted to divert attention away from this bleak but plain conclusion by asserting that the object of their expectations was not the access to a specific rate of FITs, but the more liberal regime of use of agricultural land that prevailed before the limitations imposed by Romani Decree entered into effect.208\n\nIbid., para. 68. Footnote omitted.\n\nIbid., para. 69.\n\n223.\n\nIn support of its contention, Italy cites the following excerpt from the Claimants\u2019 Reply on merits:\n\nthe Municipality\u2019s stop-work orders frustrated the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations.... The temporary suspension of the stop-work orders by the President of the Administrative Court did not change this state of affairs.*...Such decision came too late for the 'project to be completed on time to qualify for feed-in tariffs.*...209\n\nIbid., para. 70, citing Reply on Annulment, para. 318. Emphasis added. The entire paragraph does not mention the land requirements.\n\n224.\n\nThe Respondent cites another excerpt from the Claimants\u2019 Memorial in support of their contention, which states as follows:\n\nthe Claimants made substantial investments only after they had prepared a business plan on the basis of the Third Energy Account\u2019s feed-in tariffs and established that the project was attractive based on those tariffs.210\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 72, citing Memorial, paras. 438 to 454, labelled \"Italy Frustrated Legitimate Expectations and Failed to Accord Fair and Equitable Treatment.\"\n\n225.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent argues that stressing the link between the reassuring function of Brindisi Certificates and the goal to accede Conto Energia III, the Claimants synthesized their Legitimate Expectations Claim as follows:\n\nThe Claimants committed the bulk of their funds only after Watson Farley had conducted a due diligence review of the authorizations for the plants [which included the Brindisi Certificates]. That due diligence was based in substantial part on the representations made by the Municipality that the construction of the plants was authorized in accordance with regional law, and the absence of any objection by the Municipality or anyone else to the plants\u2019 construction. Similarly, the Claimants made substantial investments only after they had prepared a business plan on the basis of the Third Energy Account\u2019s feed-in tariffs and established that the project was attractive based on those tariffs.211\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 73, citing Memorial, para. 449.\n\n226.\n\nThe Respondent submits that zoning restrictions, established under Romani Decree, were discussed in another section of the claim, under Article 10(1) ECT, i.e., the one relating to Italy's alleged failure to provide stable conditions for investors. That, according to the Respondent, is an altogether different claim from the Legitimate Expectations claim. The Tribunal also dismissed this claim. That dismissal, according to the Respondent, is not before this Committee.212\n\nIbid., para. 74.\n\n227.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that the fate of the two plants in Brindisi amounts to a tiny fraction of the Claimants' project, the only one that they could attempt to carry out after coming to terms with the inability to secure external funding.213\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 107.\n\n228.\n\nThe Respondent contends that \"even if the DIAs from Brindisi had been neglected, and even if they were capable of creating certain specific legitimate expectations, these expectations would concern only and exclusively the right to build plants.\"214 \"The Claimants' Legitimate Expectations claim concerned instead the access to a specific generation of FITs.\" According to Italy, \"[i]t was therefore natural for the Tribunal to briefly dispose of the DIAs argument as it bore little relevance to the core of the claim.\"215\n\nIbid., para. 108.\n\nIbid., para. 109.\n\n229.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that the Claimants \"remarked without ambiguity that the uncertainty over the right to build the plants, caused by the stop-work order, was only challenged insofar as it disrupted their rushed attempt to meet the deadline for a specific generation of FITs:\n\nThe Regional Administrative Tribunal annulled the stop-work order as an illegal excess of authority. But the damage to the Claimants' investments was already done. No part of the project could be completed before the deadline imposed by the Romani Decree of 29 March 2012.\"216\n\nIbid., para. 111, citing Memorial, para. 452. Footnotes omitted. Emphasis added.\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent contends that when the Tribunal discarded the assertion that the Claimants had any expectations, relating to FITs, that was worth protecting, the stop-work order episode and the relevance of the DIAs was ultimately considered irrelevant.217\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 115.\n\n231.\n\nItaly also submits that in the Award, the Tribunal also explained a second reason why the Legitimate Expectations Claim could not succeed.218 It recalls that the Tribunal noted that the Legitimate Expectations Claim would fail \"in any event.\"219 \"The Tribunal explained that, even if \u2014 hypothetically \u2014 Italy had generated some legitimate expectations in the Claimants, and even if it had frustrated them by its subsequent actions, there was no causal link between such frustration and the Claimants\u2019 business' demise.\"220\n\nIbid., para. 116.\n\nIbid., para. 117.\n\nIbid., para. 119.\n\n232.\n\nIn support of the foregoing, Italy cites part of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning regarding causation, as follows:\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Claimants did not discharge the onus of proof of establishing that the Italian state\u2019s measures were the operative cause of the Puglia Project\u2019s failure. Of far greater weight was the continued dependence on project financing, and the failure to obtain it was due both to the size of the Project and to justified concerns about the scope of DIA authorisation, on which the legality of the Project depended. That being so, the claim under Article 10(1) for loss of the Project would fail in any event.221\n\nIbid., para. 120, citing Award, para. 394.\n\n233.\n\nThe Respondent also recalls that, thus, the Tribunal considered that a claim could not be upheld without causation, irrespective of any *prima facie* conduct contradicting an international obligation:\n\n... even if all (or some of [Italy\u2019s actions]) constituted breaches of the ECT, if they did not cause the failure of the Project, the Claimants cannot recover.222\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 128, citing Award, para. 375.\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the reasons why DIAs did not matter in the end are explained in paragraphs 379 and 380 of the Award. These, simply put, are that the Claimants had no legitimate expectations of the kind that could found a successful claim under Article 10(1) ECT.223\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 131.\n\n235.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that \"in any event,\" if the Tribunal had really failed to consider the Brindisi DIAs either deliberately or by mistake, and such mistake led to the failure to disregard some effective expectations worth protecting, the Award itself contains the alternative reasons why the conclusion would remain exactly the same.224\n\nIbid., para. 132.\n\n236.\n\nAs argued by the Respondent, the claim could not succeed because there was no factual link between Italy's action and Claimants' business' failure.225\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 133.\n\n237.\n\nItaly argues that \"the specific weight that the Tribunal gave (or should have given) to the DIAs was (or would have been) incapable of affecting the outcome of the Legitimate Expectations Claim.\"226\n\nIbid., para. 137.\n\n238.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimants' allegations that the relevance of Brindisi DIAs was overlooked is difficult to understand.227 This in essence, according to the Respondent, is a plea that the Tribunal should have decided differently on the existence of legitimate expectations.228\n\nIbid., para. 140.\n\nIbid., para. 141, stating that this is the specific point that the Claimants make in Memorial on Annulment, para. 124, when they stress that the Tribunal should have decided \"whether the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Brindisi... had created legitimate expectations on the Claimants' part that were dashed by the Brindisi measures.\"\n\n239.\n\nIn conclusion, Italy argues, any informed reader could understand and follow the A \u2192B logical sequence of the Award's reasons.229\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 148.\n\n**(iii) The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nThe Claimants' basic argument is that by failing to review the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity contained in Exhibit C-24, the Tribunal failed to address the second prong of their legitimate expectations claim based on the second sentence of Article 10(1). For that reason, Claimants contend that it is \"impossible to follow the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning \u2018from Point A to Point B.\u2019\"230\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 153.\n\n241.\n\nSubparagraph (e) of Article 52 (1) sets out, as a ground for annulment, \"that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\" In the view of this Committee, the Award stated the reasons on which it is based.\n\n242.\n\nWith respect to the Exhibit C-24, the Claimants acknowledged that the Award described the DIA Certificates of Conformity and their functioning.231 Moreover, this Committee recalls its previous conclusion that the Tribunal analyzed the DIA Certificates of Conformity of Brindisi \u2014 including Exhibit C-24 \u2014 in a coherent manner.232 The Tribunal addressed them and was conscious that those certificates were important for the Claimants\u2019 case.233\n\nSee paragraphs 150-156.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n243.\n\nWith respect to the legitimate expectations claim, the Committee concluded that the Tribunal saw the second claim as a \"frank alternative to its more nuanced argument based on degree of legislative claim,\"234 Moreover, the Tribunal specifically referred to the second sentence of Article 10(1).235 Finally, the Tribunal extensively analyzed and made a finding on the claims under Article 10(1).236\n\nAward, para. 366.\n\nSee paragraph 157-178.\n\nIbid.\n\n244.\n\nThe cases cited by the Claimants refer to certain situations that are qualified as \"significant lacuna,\"237 \"impossible for the reader to follow,\"238 \"complete absence of any discussion.\"239 For the reasons stated, this Committee is of the view that the Award is far from being tainted with any of such defects. The Award complies with the *TECO* committee\u2019s requirement, quoted by the Claimants, \"... to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law.\"240\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 79 citing *CMS,* Legal Authority CL-263.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 79 citing *CMS,* Legal Authority CL-263.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 81, citing *TECO,* Legal Authority CL-272.\n\n*TECO,* para. 78, Legal Authority CL-272. The Committee further observes that, according to the TECO standard, by its use of the adverb \"eventually\" this criterion allows certain leeway to tribunals. The language also suggests that in the view of the *TECO* committee a mere \"error of fact or of law\" alone cannot be equated with a failure to state the reasons on which an award is based. Given that the this Committee considers that it did not identify any error of fact or law, this Committee does not find it necessary to test the boundaries of this standard.\n\n245.\n\nThe committee in *Enron* observed:\n\nthe tribunal is required only to give reasons for its decision in respect of each of the questions.... the award will not be annulled on the basis that the tribunal could have given more detailed reasons and analysis for its findings of fact or law, or that the tribunal did not expressly state its evaluation in respect to each individual item of evidence or each individual legal authority or legal provision relied upon by the parties, or\n\ndid not expressly state a view on every single legal and factual issue raised by the parties in the course of the proceedings. The tribunal is required to state reasons for its *decision,* but not necessarily reasons for its *reasons.*241\n\n*Enron,* para. 222, Legal Authority CL-265. Emphasis added.\n\n246.\n\nConsistent with this criterion, the Tribunal evaluated the specific evidence, i.e. Exhibit C-24 and adjudicated the claim which stemmed from it. Thus, this *ad hoc* Committee is of the view that the Tribunal did not fail in its duty to state the reasons for the Award. For the abovementioned reasons, this Committee dismisses the Annulment Request under ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(e).\n\n**D. Article 52(1)(b): The Tribunal Manifestly Exceeded Its Powers**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimants begin by arguing that the excess of power includes failure to exercise jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and to fully discharge its mandate.242\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 84.\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimants note and argue that as recalled by Professor Schreuer, \"[a]n arbitral tribunal derives its power from the parties' agreement [to arbitrate].\" He further notes that \"[t]he most important form of excess of powers occurs when a tribunal exceeds the limits of its jurisdiction\" but that \"[a] tribunal may also exceed its power by failing to exercise a jurisdiction it does have.\" This is in line with the case law of ICSID *ad hoc* committees, which often refer to the work of Professor Schreuer.243\n\nIbid., para. 84, citing Christoph H.

Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention requires not only there to be an excess of powers, but also that such excess be manifest. As explained by Professor Schreuer, the ordinary meaning of the term \u2018manifest\u2019 is \u2018\"plain\", \"clear\", \"obvious\", \"evident\" and easily understood or recognized by the mind.\u2019\"244 This is not disputed by Italy.245\n\nMemorial on Annulment, 85, citing ICSID Convention, art.52(1)(b); Christoph H. Schreuer et al., *The ICSID Convention\u2014A Commentary,* p. 938, paras. 134-135, Legal Authority CL-256.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 113.\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimants contend that if a tribunal has jurisdiction to answer a question, has announced that it would do so and ultimately fails to do so, as shown above, such a failure is \"plain,\" \"clear,\" \"obvious,\" \"evident\" and \"easily understood or recognized by the mind\" and thus, manifest.246 They also contend that Italy does not dispute this.247\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 86.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 114.\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants note that the Parties agree that this ground for annulment includes a tribunal\u2019s failure to exercise jurisdiction *ratione materiae* and to fully discharge its mandate.248\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 112, citing Memorial on Annulment, para. 84; and Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 153.\n\n252.\n\nThe Claimants quote part of the reasoning of the *Vivendi I ad hoc* Committee in support of their contention in this regard:\n\nIt is settled, and neither party disputes, that an ICSID tribunal commits an excess of powers not only if it exercises a jurisdiction which it does not have under the relevant agreement or treaty and the ICSID Conventions, read together, but also if it fails to exercise a jurisdiction which it possesses under those instruments.249\n\nOne might qualify this by saying that it is only where the failure to exercise a jurisdiction is clearly capable of making a difference to the result that it can be considered a manifest excess of power.250\n\n[I]t is only where the failure to exercise a jurisdiction is clearly capable of making a difference to the result that it can be considered a manifest excess of power.251\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opening Statement, slide 41, citing *Vivendi I,* para. 86, Legal Authority CL-259.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 87, citing *Vivendi I,* para. 86, Legal Authority CL-259.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 139, citing *Vivendi I,* para. 86, Legal Authority CL-259.\n\n253.\n\nThe Claimants also advance the argument that \"[i]t is not within the tribunal\u2019s powers to refuse to decide a dispute or part of a dispute that meets all jurisdictional requirements of Art. 25.\"252\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opening Statement, slide 42, citing *Malicorp,* para. 47, Legal Authority CL-270.\n\n254.\n\nIn addition, they quote that \"a manifest excess of power would consist... in answering only a part of a question in fact raised by the parties.\"253\n\nClaimants\u2019 Opening Statement, slide 43, citing *Soufraki,* para. 44, Legal Authority CL-261.\n\n255.\n\nThe Claimants further manifest that \"ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) leads to the same result.

Italy\u2019s allegation that the Tribunal \u2018discharged its arbitral duty by taking into account the arguments of the parties and the evidence submitted, including the DIAs\u2019 is simply unsupported.\"255\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 173, citing Counter-Memorial on Annulment paras. 165-168 (discussing *Soufraki,* para. 75, Legal Authority CL-261); and Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 169.

In short,\" according to them, \"the Tribunal declined to use the powers vested in it by the Parties and to fully discharge the mandate which it had itself acknowledged. Such a defect is an excess of powers.\" The Claimants submit that the defect is manifest for two reasons. First, because it is textually obvious from the evident lacuna in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis. Second, because it is substantively serious as it went to the heart of one of the Claimants\u2019 claims. As a result, they submit the Award be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.260\n\nIbid., para. 126.\n\n**(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------------\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent begins by arguing that in order for an award to be annulled, the tribunal must have acted in excess of its conferred powers, and must have done so in a manner which is manifest.261\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 151.\n\n262.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that an excess of power can occur \"when the tribunal disregards the applicable law or grounds its decision in the award on a law other than the law applicable under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention.\"262\n\nIbid., para. 154, citing *Gambrinus, Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/31, Decision on Annulment, October 3, 2017, para. 163, Legal Authority ARL-20.\n\n263.\n\nThe Respondent notes that \"[w]hereas certain committees have remarked on the effect on the award's outcome that such excess of power would inevitably entail, that is more a consequence of this ground rather than an essential element.\"263\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 156.\n\n264.\n\nIt also notes that \"[t]o ascertain whether an excess of power is \u2018manifest,' tribunals have routinely referred to a test of self-evidence: the excess of power must be obvious and cannot depend on an elaborate or searching analysis of the award.\"264\n\nIbid., para. 157, citing ICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID,* paras. 82-83, Legal Authority AR-19, and cases cited therein.

As noted in the *Vivendi I* case:\n\nNo doubt an ICSID tribunal is not required to address in its award every argument made by the parties, provided of course that the arguments which it actually does consider are themselves capable of leading to the conclusion reached by the tribunal and that all questions submitted to a tribunal are expressly or implicitly dealt with.269\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 113.\n\n268.\n\nThe Respondent cites, in support of their contention regarding the present ground for annulment, the *Soufraki* case. In that case, the claimant argued in annulment proceedings that the tribunal should have inferred from a set of documents, i.e., the certificates of nationality, a legal consequence, the proof of nationality, which was necessary to establish jurisdiction.270 The *ad hoc* committee considered that the tribunal, in doing otherwise, far from exceeding its jurisdiction, discharged its jurisdictional mandate dutifully, irrespective of the correctness of its conclusions on the point:\n\nThe *ad hoc* Committee believes that in not considering the national documentation on nationality as conclusive and in ascertaining on its own the nationality of the Claimant, the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers, but on the contrary asserted a power which it was bound to exercise in order to verify its competence under the ICSID Convention and the [applicable] BIT.271\n\nRespondent\u2019s Opening Statements on Grounds for Annulment, slide 62.\n\nIbid.\n\n269.\n\nThus, the Respondent contends that \"[t]he same reasoning applies here. Called to discharge its jurisdiction, on the merits of the case, the Tribunal needed to assess whether the Legitimate Expectations Claim had any merits.\"272 \"It discharged its arbitral duty taking into account the arguments of the parties and the evidence submitted, including the DIAs.\"273\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 168.\n\nIbid., para. 169.\n\n270.\n\nOn the foregoing basis, the Respondent contends that \"when the Tribunal did not consider the DIAs from Brindisi \u2018as conclusive' in ascertaining the existence of legitimate expectations, it \u2018did not manifestly exceed its powers, but on the contrary asserted a power which it was bound to exercise in order to verify' whether the Claimants had any expectations to begin with.\"274\n\nIbid., para. 170.\n\n271.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent contends that, \"[i]n any event, the Claimants' attempt to create a discrete Legitimate Expectations sub-claim that only regarded Brindisi's DIAs and the stop-work order is not viable.\"275 First, the stop-work order related to the construction of two plants, out of the around 120 initially planned.276 Second, the stop-work order remained in effect for only two days and was definitively annulled less than two months after it was issued.277\n\nIbid., para. 172.\n\nIbid., para. 173.\n\nIbid., para. 174, citing Award, para. 119.\n\n272.\n\nItaly further contends that if the Claimants' point about the legitimate expectation to build a couple of plants, was genuine it would be sufficient to note how that expectation encountered no more than a mere glitch. But for this insignificant bump on the road the actions of the Respondent did not interfere with the legitimate expectation of the Claimants which was preserved.278 The Respondent further contends that in this respect, the Tribunal in its award sufficiently address the matter. According to the Respondent it cannot, therefore, be reasonably contended that the Tribunal fell short in exercising its jurisdiction.279\n\nThe stop-work order \u2014 the only measure taken specifically in relation to the Project \u2014 was granted and revoked in a timely manner and in accordance with rule of law standards.280\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 175.\n\nIbid., para. 176.\n\nIbid., para. 177.\n\n273.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent contends that the stop-work order is exploited to create a storyline to serve the Claimants' case regarding the FITs. According to the Respondent, in this regard, the Claimants' own words could not be clearer:\n\n[the annulment of the stop-work order] came down on 7 March 2012 and confirmed the validity of the authorizations at issue. Unfortunately, there was not enough time to build the project's plants between the decision of the Administrative Court on 7 March 2012 and the expiration of the 29 March 2012 deadline imposed by the Romani Decree.281\n\nIbid., para. 178.\n\n274.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the foregoing establish that the Award was very clear about the lack of merit of the Legitimate Expectations Claim relating to FITs. It is final in that respect. Therefore, the instrumental argument of the delay caused by the stop-work order is immaterial to the Award's conclusion even without mentioning the all-encompassing causation finding.282\n\nIbid., para. 179.\n\n275.\n\nRegarding the specific issue of outcome-determinativeness, the Respondent submits that the controlling test is the \"manifest\" nature of a tribunal's excess of authority, as stipulated by Article 52 of ICSID Convention. The impact of this circumstance on the award is just an obvious consequence and a heuristic rather than a legal benchmark.283\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 114, citing Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 156.\n\n276.\n\nItaly further contends that it is unclear why the *Vivendi I* decision, according to which an excess of power is manifest when it is \"clearly *capable of making a difference,\"* should assist the Claimants.284 Italy advances three main reasons why this *dictum,* according to it, does not support the Claimants.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 114, citing Reply on Annulment, para. 139; *Vivendi I,* para. 86, Legal Authority CL-259. Emphasis added by Claimants.\n\n277.\n\nFirst, the emphasis of this *dictum* is obviously on the word \"clearly\" which qualifies it. An excess of power that is not \"clearly\" capable of making a difference does not warrant annulment. This has to be read together with the word \"manifestly\" in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which sets the threshold requirement by qualifying the words \"exceeded its powers.\" This stipulates that instances of excess of powers that are not *prima facie* decisive in the tribunal's ultimate finding will not render the award annullable.285\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 116.\n\n278.\n\n\"Second, the *ad hoc* committee in *Vivendi I* produced two versions of the decision, one in Spanish and one in English, \u2018both versions being equally authoritative.' A quick glance at the Spanish text reveals that \u2018clearly capable of making a difference' must not be construed to include a mere possibility. The Spanish text reads *\u2018claramente importa una diferencia significativa para el resultado'* and does not feature the nuance of potentiality that the Claimants... read in the word \u2018capable.\u2019 To the extent that the English version retained some ambiguity in the use of the word \u2018capable,\u2019 its meaning is clearly established by comparison with the other official text, which expressly mentions only an excess of power that \u2018clearly makes a meaningful difference.\u2019 Because of the \u2018clearly\u2019 qualifier, there is actually no difference between the two versions: what matters is not just the \u2018if but the \u2018how much\u2019 of outcome-determinativeness.\"286\n\nIbid., para. 117, citing *Vivendi I, para. 86,* Legal Authority CL-259.\n\n279.\n\n\"Third, two lines below this formula the committee rephrased the same notion, and the suggestion of potentiality is lost, in both languages. The English text refers to \u2018circumstances where the outcome of the inquiry [of the Tribunal] is affected as a result [of the excess of power].\u2019 The Spanish version reads: *\u2018circunstancias donde se ve\u00eda afectado el resultado de su examen.*\"287\n\nIbid., para. 118.\n\n280.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that \"a review of the outcome-determinativeness of the alleged excess of power must reveal that it has produced a material impact on the conclusion reached by the tribunal. To warrant annulment, the impact must be such that it can be reasonably argued that the result would have likely been different but for [such] excess. Without such material impact, it becomes virtually impossible to meet the \u2018manifest\u2019 requirement of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\"288\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 119.\n\n281.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that \"there is nothing in the Award that evinces or suggests that the Tribunal committed an excess of power, let alone manifest, let alone outcome-determinative, let alone materially so.\"289\n\nIbid., para. 120.\n\n**(iii) The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 principal contention is that it was within the mandate of the Tribunal to address the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity as well as the corresponding legitimate expectations claim.290 By failing to do so, the Tribunal exceeded its power. Moreover, the Claimants contend that this was \"manifest\" because it was a \"lacuna\" in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis and the omission goes \"to the heart\" of one of the Claimants\u2019 claims.291\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 124-125.\n\nIbid., para. 126.\n\n283.\n\nSubparagraph (b) of Article 52(1) provides a ground for annulment where \"the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers.\" The adverb \"manifestly\" means \"in a way that everyone can easily understand.\" In the particular case of subparagraph (b), it is not sufficient to find that the tribunal exceeded its powers, it has to be \"manifestly\" so.\n\n284.\n\nWith respect to the failure to address Exhibit C-24 the Claimants acknowledged that the Award described the DIA Certificates of Conformity and their functioning.292 Moreover, this Committee recalls its previous conclusion that the Tribunal analyzed the DIA Certificates of Conformity of Brindisi \u2014 including Exhibit C-24 \u2014 in a coherent manner.293 The Tribunal addressed them and was conscious that those certificates were important for the Claimants\u2019 case.294\n\nSee paragraphs 150-156.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n285.\n\nWith respect to the legitimate expectations claim, the Committee concluded that the Tribunal saw the second claim as a \"frank alternative to its more nuanced argument based on degree of legislative claim,\"295 Moreover, the Tribunal specifically referred to the second sentence of Article 10(1).296 Finally, the Tribunal extensively analyzed and made a finding on the claims under Article 10(1).297\n\nAward, para. 366.\n\nSee paragraph 157-178.\n\nIbid.\n\n286.\n\nBased on the above, the Committee finds no excess of powers by the Tribunal. Consequently, it does not need to analyze whether it was manifestly so. The Tribunal clearly exercised its jurisdiction and ruled on the question raised by the disputing parties. Accordingly, this Committee finds that the Tribunal has not exceeded its powers. For the abovementioned reasons, the Committee rejects the Annulment Request under ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(b).\n\n**E. Article 52(1) (d): The Tribunal Seriously Departed from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(i) The Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"the obligation for any ICSID tribunal to properly review the record, and particularly those parts of the record principally relied upon by each party in support of their respective cases, is a necessary corollary of the parties' right to be heard. It is a fundamental rule of procedure. This right would be an empty shell if an ICSID tribunal could disregard its obligation to properly review the key evidence on record, which is at stake here.\"298\n\nMemorial on Annulment, paras. 94, 127.\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimants allege that, in the present case, the above obligation was breached by the Tribunal. They further contend that it is plain from the Award that the Tribunal failed to locate in **Exhibit C-24** the 48 DIA Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Brindisi and, therefore, to draw any consequence from them in its analysis of the case.299\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 128.\n\n289.\n\nThe Claimants manifest that the Parties agree on a series of criteria regarding the legal standard applicable to this particular ground for annulment.\n\n290.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argue that they agree that the departure must be substantial, which means that the departure must potentially have led the tribunal to issue an award substantially different from what it would have been, had the fundamental rule of procedure been observed.300\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 118, citing Memorial on Annulment, para. 96; Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 185. The Claimants also quote in the same direction in paragraph 142 of the Reply on Annulment that the *CDC* endorsed the *Wena Hotels* statements in the same terms.\n\n291.\n\nSecond, the Claimants submit that according to the *Fraport ad hoc* committee, \"a \u2018fundamental rule of procedure' is intended to denote procedural rules which may properly be said to constitute \u2018general principles of law'[\u2026] The Parties also agree that the treatment of evidence is one of these principles.\"301\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 119, citing Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 183 (quoting *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Servs. Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Decision on the Application for Annulment of Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Services Worldwide, December 23, 2010, para. 187, Legal Authority CL-266 (\"*Fraport*\")); Memorial on Annulment, para. 94; Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 184(iv). Footnote omitted.\n\n292.\n\nThey note, however, that the Respondent disagrees on the issue of whether the departure from such rule \"\u2018caused the arbitration and the resulting award to lose its judicial character.'

While the Committee accepts that a tribunal cannot be required to address within its award each and every piece of evidence in the record, that cannot be construed to mean that a Tribunal can simply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, without any analysis and without explaining why it found that evidence insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory.303\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 122, citing Memorial on Annulment, paras. 91-92; *TECO,* para. 131, Legal Authority CL-272.\n\n294.\n\nAs a consequence of the foregoing, the Claimants argue that \"an ICSID tribunal cannot \u2018simply gloss over evidence upon which the parties have placed significant emphasis,'... because it must have reviewed such evidence in the first place. This is part and parcel of the \u2018judicial character' that the award must have and that Italy rightly emphasizes.\"304\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 123.\n\n295.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants cite in support of their present contention the fact that the *Suez ad hoc* committee confirmed that a tribunal is duty-bound to the parties to at least address those pieces of evidence that the parties deem to be highly relevant to their case. That committee clarified that \"highly relevant\" evidence is the kind that \"must have the potential to have an impact on the outcome of the Award.\"305\n\nIbid., para. 124; *Suez,* para. 303, Legal Authority CL-284.\n\n296.\n\nThe Claimants further cite in a different but relevant context, by analogy, the European Court of Human Rights. They submit that that Court has \"repeatedly stated that the right to a fair trial includes the parties' right to submit the requests and observations they deem relevant to their case. That right cannot be seen as effective unless the requests and observations of the parties are truly \u2018heard,\u2019 that is to say properly examined by the tribunal.\"306\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 125, citing *Dulaurans v. France,* ECtHR (3rd Section) Case No. 34553/97, Judgment, March 21, 2000, para. 33, Legal Authority CL-276 (unofficial English translation: \"The Court reiterates that the right to a fair trial, guaranteed by Article 6 para. 1 of the Convention, encompasses, *inter alia,* the right of the parties to the trial to submit the observations that they deem relevant to their case.... this right can be considered effective only if these observations are really \u2018heard\u2019, i.e. duly examined by the tribunal seized.\") (the French original reads: \"La Cour rappelle que le droit \u00e0 un proc\u00e8s \u00e9quitable, garanti par l\u2019article 6 \u00a7 1 de la Convention, englobe, entre autres, le droit des parties au proc\u00e8s \u00e0 pr\u00e9senter les observations qu\u2019elles estiment pertinentes pour leur affaire.... ce droit ne peut passer pour effectif que si ces observations sont vraiment \u2018entendues\u2019, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire d\u00fbment examin\u00e9es par le tribunal saisi.\"); *Carmel Saliba v.

Azerbaijan* (No. 2), ECtHR (5th Section) Case No. 919/15, Judgment, November 16, 2017, para. 206, Legal Authority CL-285 (enouncing same principle). See also *Marc Fouquet v. France,* ECm HR (2nd Chamber) Case No. 20398/92, Commission Report, October 12, 1994, para. 36, Legal Authority CL-275 (unofficial English translation: \"[It is] incumbent on the \u2018tribunal\u2019 to conduct an effective assessment of the submissions, arguments and evidence submitted by the parties....\") (the French original reads: \"[Est] \u00e0 la charge du \u2018tribunal\u2019, l\u2019obligation de se livrer \u00e0 un examen effectif des moyens, arguments et offres de preuve des parties....\"); ibid., para. 38 (unofficial English translation: \"The Commission is of the opinion that a litigant is not effectively heard if an essential defence is overlooked.\") (the French original reads: \"La Commission est d\u2019avis qu\u2019 un plaideur n\u2019est pas effectivement entendu lorsqu\u2019un moyen de d\u00e9fense essentiel est m\u00e9connu.\"). As the Committee is aware, the European Commission of Human Rights set up in 1954 was replaced by the European Court of Human rights when Protocol No. 11 to the European Convention on Human Rights came into force on November 1, 1998. Protocol No. 11 abolished the Commission and allowed individuals to apply directly to the Court, which was given compulsory jurisdiction.\n\n297.\n\nThus, the Claimants claim that \"a tribunal\u2019s failure to properly examine a party\u2019s evidence... undoubtedly violates the right to be heard and the right to a fair trial. In that sense, a tribunal\u2019s failure to consider the essential evidence submitted by a party would \u2018cause the arbitration and the resulting award to lose its judicial character\u2019 to use the language quoted by Italy in its Counter-Memorial.\"307\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 127, citing Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 182.\n\n298.\n\nThey further quote part of the reasoning of the *Pey Casado ad hoc* Committee:\n\nThe Committee subscribes to the Respondent\u2019s view. *The applicant is not required to show that the result would have been different,* that it would have won the case, if the rule had been respected. The Committee notes in fact that, in *Wena,* the committee stated that the applicant must demonstrate \"the impact that the issue *may have had* on the award.\" The Committee agrees that this is precisely how the seriousness of the departure must be analyzed.\n\n\u2026\n\n*In the Committee\u2019s view, it has no discretion not to annul an award if a serious departure from a fundamental rule is established.* The Committee exercises its discretion when it determines whether or not the departure was serious. Examining the seriousness of the departure implies a review of seriousness of the act concerned, *i.e,* the deprivation of the legal right protected by the rule and a review of the seriousness of the consequence or impact of the departure. The discretion of the Committee lies in the evaluation of the impact. The impact will most likely be material and require an annulment if the departure affects the legal right of the parties with respect to an outcome-determinative issue. In other words, a finding that if the rule had been observed the tribunal *could have reached a different conclusion.* As indicated earlier, the Committee does not consider, however, that an applicant is required to prove that the tribunal would necessarily have changed its conclusion if the rule had been observed. *This requires a committee to enter into the realm of speculation which it should not do...*308\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 143, citing *Victor Pey Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Republic of Chile, December 18, 2012, paras. 78, 80, Legal Authority CL-269 *(\"Pey Casado\").* Footnote omitted, emphasis added.\n\n299.\n\nThe Claimants submit that in line with the foregoing, the *TECO ad hoc* committee opined:\n\nRequiring an applicant to show that it would have won the case or that the result of the case would have been different if the rule of procedure had been respected is a highly speculative exercise. *An annulment committee cannot determine with any degree of certainty whether any of these results would have occurred without placing itself in the shoes of a tribunal, something which is not within its powers to do*. What a committee can determine however is whether the tribunal\u2019s compliance with a rule of procedure could *potentially* have affected the award.309\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 144, citing *TECO,* para. 85, Legal Authority CL-272. Emphasis added.\n\n300.\n\nThe Claimants contend that presenting one\u2019s case has two different components.310 One has to do with the right of the parties to introduce factual and legal evidence of their choice. The other \u2014 which is the one at stake in this case \u2014 has to do with the obligation of the tribunal to look at the evidence thus introduced. There is no point in giving a party the right to introduce evidence if, as a necessary corollary, there is not an obligation for the tribunal to look at the evidence. Looking at the evidence is one of the key obligations of any tribunal. If no such obligation were to exist, the equality between the parties would be breached \u2014 with one party having its evidence looked at and the other not, wholly or partly. The Claimants submit that Italy does not appear to disagree with this principle either.311\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 128.\n\nIbid., para. 129, citing Memorial on Annulment, para. 94; \"One would even wonder whether one could speak of a proper \u2018tribunal\u2019 or \u2018jurisdiction\u2019 in such a case.\"\n\n301.\n\nThe Claimants contest the Respondent\u2019s contention that the Claimants allege not an *error in procedendo* but an *error in judicando,* by saying that an *error in judicando* is an error made by the Tribunal in the adjudication of the claims,312 and that they do not dispute what the Tribunal decided. They, however, submit that the Tribunal could not have decided what it did when it failed to review a critical document brought to its attention no less than 30 times. And this too after the Tribunal had itself implicitly announced that it would review this document. The Tribunal had to announce this because it was the sole foundation of the second ground of the Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations Claim.313 Yet, this is precisely what the Tribunal failed to do.\n\nTr.

Day 2, 34:21-25 - 35:1 - 3.\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimants recall their previous assertion concerning the fact that they referred, in the course of the arbitration, to Exhibit C-24 or the content of the Brindisi\u2019s DIA Certificates of Conformity more than 30 times.314 However, the Claimants contend that \"the Tribunal looked at page 1 of Exhibit C-24 (the template translation of the five certificates of the municipality of Mesagne) and discussed it at paragraph 379 of the Award, noting that these certificates were \u2018not at all the same thing\u2019 as what was alleged by the Claimants. It failed, however, to look at page 3 of the PDF document, which precisely evidenced the specific representations relied upon by the Claimant.\" They argue that even \"[i]f the Tribunal did not wish to look at all the 53 DIA Certificates of Conformity in Exhibit C-24, in their Italian version, it should have at least looked at the two pages of template translations in English included in that exhibit, as it had itself authorized at paragraph 11.3 of Procedural Order No. 1. This,\" they submit, \"is the bare minimum that the Parties and ICSID as an institution could ask for.\"315\n\nSee *supra,* 105, Memorial on Annulment, para. 129, and Claimants, citing Memorial on Annulment, para. 56.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 130.\n\n303.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Claimants allege that \"if an *ad hoc* committee finds a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, it must also annul the award and leave it to the resubmission tribunal to decide the outcome of the case.\"316 As a consequence, they also contend, that in such circumstances, first, the Tribunal\u2019s complete disregard of Exhibit C-24 in adjudicating the Legitimate Expectations Claim, second its partial reliance on selective parts of that exhibit, i.e., the five Certificates of Conformity issued by the municipality of Mesagne, and, third, its failure to consider the 48 certificates issued by the municipality of Brindisi, in other parts of its analysis, individually, as well as, and particularly cumulatively, constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. On these bases they request that the Award be annulled under Article 52(1)(d).317\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 146.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, para. 131.\n\n**(ii) The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------------\n\n304.\n\nThe Respondent begins its submissions by reviewing the applicable standard of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. It submits that it replicates, without significant amendments, Article 35(c) of the Model Rules on Arbitral Procedure prepared by the International Law Commission (ILC).318 The Respondent argues that, therefore, \"the commentary prepared by the ILC about this provision illustrates its function, and applies without difficulty to the equivalent clause of the ICSID Convention:\n\nthe principle that the tribunal must function in the manner of a judicial body and with respect for the fundamental rules governing the proceedings of any judicial body. The paragraph is concerned with error *in procedendo,* not with error *in judicando.* It is, further, concerned with serious departures from fundamental procedural rules rather than minor departures.\"319\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 180, citing United Nations, *Yearbook of the International Law Commission,* 1958, Vol. II, p. 86, Legal Authority ARL-27.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 181.\n\n305.\n\nThe Respondent notes that as discussed by the *Fraport ad hoc* committee, the ILC remarked on the rationale of this clause endorsing the test formulated by Carlston in the literature:\n\nDoes the departure constitute a deprivation of a fundamental right so as to cause the arbitration and the resulting award to lose its judicial character? Unless its effect is to prejudice materially the interests of a party, the charge of nullity should not be open to a party.320\n\nIbid., para. 182, citing *Fraport,* para. 184, Legal Authority CL-266; Kenneth S. Carlston, *The Process of International Arbitration.* (Columbia University Press, 1946) pp. 38-39, cited in ILC Commentary, Legal Authority ARL-28.\n\n306.\n\nThe Respondent recalls that committees have identified certain principles a departure from which could fall under this ground:\n\n(i) the equal treatment of the parties;\n\n(ii) the right to be heard;\n\n(iii) an independent and impartial Tribunal;\n\n(iv) the treatment of evidence and burden of proof; and\n\n(v) deliberations among members of the Tribunal.321\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 184, citing ICISD, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID,* para. 99, Legal Authority ARL-19.\n\n307.\n\nItaly submits that even a \"departure from one of these principles is insufficient to warrant annulment, if it is not serious. Whilst the \u2018seriousness\u2019 requirement is case-specific, several committees have stated that it is met when the disregard of the rule of procedure determine[s] the outcome of the award.\"322\n\nIbid., 185, citing ICSID, *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID,* para. 100, Legal Authority ARL-19, referring to the decisions in *Wena Hotels,* para. 58, Legal Authority CL-258; *Repsol,* para. 81, Legal Authority ARL-23; *CDC,* para. 49, Legal Authority CL-260; *Fraport,* para. 246, Legal Authority CL-266; *Impregilo S.p.A. v.

Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/1, Legal Authority ARL-07.\n\n308.\n\nThe Respondent quotes part of the reasoning of the *TECO ad hoc* Committee in support of their contention regarding the applicable standard to the present ground for annulment, as follows:\n\nThe *TECO* Committee acknowledged that absolute certainty of the hypothetical outcome could not be obtained, let alone required as proved, let alone rubber-stamped by the committee. What an *ad hoc* committee is tasked to do, ultimately, is determining \"whether the tribunal\u2019s compliance with a rule of procedure could potentially have affected the award.\"323 The wording of this statement is very clear and should not occasion confusion: to consider any potential outcome-determinativeness is indeed the *task of the committee,* but it is not the applicable *standard of annulment.* This sentence describes the powers of the committee, not the threshold of seriousness required for this ground for annulment to operate. Of course, it is within the jurisdiction of the committee to assess whether there is outcome-determinativeness, of any magnitude \u2014 even none.324\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 123; *TECO,* para. 85, Legal Authority CL-272.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 123.\n\n309.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants\u2019 argument regarding this ground for annulment duplicates its submissions about the alleged lack of reasons for the Award.325\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 186.\n\n310.\n\nParaphrasing *Carlston's* test, Respondent submits that \"the question before the Committee is whether the tribunal has actually disregarded the procedural guarantees in such a way as to \u2018cause the arbitration and the resulting award to lose its judicial character.\u2019\" And it suggests that the answer is \"no.\"326\n\nIbid., para. 188.\n\n311.\n\nItaly contends that the Claimants were unable to point to a single authority supporting their case.327 It submits that the few cases in which a breach of Article 52(1)(d) caused a full or partial annulment of the award have nothing in common with this case.328\n\nIbid., para. 189.\n\nIbid., para. 190.\n\n312.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that even admitting, on its face, the Claimants\u2019 erroneous assumption that the Tribunal has neglected to examine the DIAs issued by the municipality of Brindisi, cannot be equated with:\n\na) the tribunal\u2019s failure to allow both parties to present their case on newly submitted evidence, or\n\nb) the tribunal\u2019s failure to afford the respondent to present its arguments on the standard applicable to the calculation of damages for a breach of FET, or\n\nc) the tribunal\u2019s failure to fix a time-limit for a party's submissions in the event of a request for rectification of the award made by the other party.329\n\nIbid., para. 191, citing *Fraport,* para. 230, Legal Authority CL-266; *Pey Casado,* para. 269, Legal Authority CL-269; *Amco,* paras. 9.07-9.10, Legal Authority ARL-29.\n\n313.\n\nItaly further contends, in this regard, that \"[i]n all these cases the ground for annulment was upheld with respect to errors *in procedendo* that affected directly the parties\u2019 equality of arms.\"330 Italy claims that the Claimants, in their submissions, invoke instead an alleged error *in judicando,* as according to the Claimants the Tribunal has mistakenly given insufficient weight to the Brindisi DIAs.331\n\nIbid., para. 192.\n\nIbid., para. 193.\n\n314.\n\nThe Respondent submits that since the Claimants clung onto the *TECO* decision with obvious pertinacity or rather to a few sentences of that decision, artfully arranged but without much context, it might help to distinguish between the present proceedings and those underlying the *TECO* annulment decision. The Respondent submits that its views in the Counter-Memorial on Annulment had no discernible effect on the Claimants\u2019 arguments. It would, therefore, now rely on the words of the *ad hoc* committee in *Suez* (2017), instead. That case, according to Italy, illustrates how, to put it very simply, *TECO* is the wrong basket for the Claimants to put all its legal eggs in.\n\nContrary to the TECO case, the Tribunal in the present case did not consider that there was \"no sufficient evidence\" for a certain issue, without specifying why the expert reports submitted by the parties did not qualify as such evidence. It can rather be reasonably inferred from the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning that it did consider the evidence before it and reached its conclusions on that evidentiary basis, albeit without discussing in detail any particular item filed by either Party.332\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, para. 126, citing Reply on Annulment, paras. 166-167; *Suez,* para. 300, Legal Authority CL-284. Footnote omitted, emphasis added.\n\n315.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing, the Respondent contends that the case here is the same. \"Contrary to the *TECO* case,\" the Tribunal did not profess that the evidence relating to the Legitimate Expectations Claim was insufficient. Even without providing a detailed discussion of all the documents collected in Exhibit C-24, the Tribunal reached a conclusion on the basis of the available evidence and the parties\u2019 arguments. Anyone reading the Award can have no problem understanding why the Tribunal rejected the Claimants\u2019 Legitimate Expectations Claim, regardless of whether he or she shares the underlying reason.\n\n**(iii) The Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n----------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nLike with their previous claims, the Claimants allege that the complete disregard of Exhibit C-24 in the respective legitimate expectations claim, to only consider the Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Mesagne and, finally, failure to consider the Certificates of Conformity issued by the Municipality of Brindisi, collectively and individually, amount to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n317.\n\nSubparagraph (d) of Article 52(1) refers to the ground of annulment consisting of a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\" The adjective \"serious\" means \"significant or worrying because of possible danger or risk; not slight or negligible.\"\n\n318.\n\nAs a general proposition, the disregard of evidence constitutes an infringement of a fundamental rule of procedure.333 Thus, before addressing whether the departure was fundamental, the first question is whether such issue arises in this case.\n\nReply on Annulment, para. 119. Memorial on Annulment, para. 94; Counter-Memorial on Annulment, para. 184(iv).\n\n319.\n\nExhibit C-24 is at the heart of Claimants\u2019 claim. However, this Committee is not satisfied that there has been any omission or failure to consider relevant evidence. The Claimants acknowledged that the Award described the DIA Certificates of Conformity and their functioning.334 Moreover, this Committee recalls its previous conclusion that the Tribunal analyzed the DIA Certificates of Conformity of Brindisi \u2014 including Exhibit C-24 \u2014 in a coherent manner.335 The Tribunal addressed them and was conscious that those certificates were important for the Claimants\u2019 case.336\n\nSee paragraphs 150-156.\n\nIbid.\n\nIbid.\n\n320.\n\nWith respect to the legitimate expectations claim, the Committee concluded that the Tribunal saw the second claim as a \"frank alternative to its more nuanced argument based on degree of legislative claim,\"337 Moreover, the Tribunal specifically referred to the second sentence of Article 10(1).338. Finally, the Tribunal extensively analyzed and made a finding on the claims under Article 10(1).339\n\nAward, para. 366.\n\nSee paragraphs 157-178.\n\nIbid.\n\n321.\n\nThus, Exhibit C-24 was in fact addressed by the Tribunal within the Award, accordingly the Claimants have not been able to persuade this Committee that there was a \"departure\" from a fundamental rule of procedure. That being the case the condition of the departure being \"serious\" cannot possibly be met.\n\n322.\n\nFor the abovementioned reasons, this Committee concludes that the Annulment Request under ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(d) is not well founded. It is accordingly rejected.\n\n**VIII. THE RESPONDENT\u2019S REQUEST FOR IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF THE ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n323.\n\nOn February 4, 2019, the Respondent filed a request for a decision declaring immediate termination of the Annulment Proceeding pursuant to EU Member States' Declaration on the legal consequences of the Achmea Judgement.\n\n324.\n\nBoth parties filed detailed pleadings and made oral submissions on the issue.340\n\nRespondent\u2019s Request for an award declaring immediate termination dated February 4, 2019; Claimants\u2019 letter of February 5, 2019 responding thereto; Transcript D1:P78:L14-P80:L15 and D2:P46:L9-P51:L20 (Claimants) Transcript D1:P81:L93-P98:L16 (Respondent).\n\n325.\n\nThis *ad hoc* Committee has dismissed the Request for Annulment of the Award. The Award therefore stands and this particular issue is moot.341 It is, therefore, unnecessary for it to either record or analyze the submissions of the parties or state its opinion on the subject. The matter is best left to be determined in proceedings where it squarely arises. This Committee, therefore, records no finding on it.\n\nAt the hearing, Respondent submitted to the Committee the Declaration of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States on the Legal Consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on the Investment Protection in the European Union of 15 January 2019. In this regard, Respondent recognized that this was a new fact affecting the Committee\u2019s jurisdiction but made clear that it was leaving it open to the Committee\u2019s discretion what to do with such declaration. See D1:P155:L13-22 and D2:P94:L23-P97:L24.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. The Parties\u2019 Positions on Costs**\n--------------------------------------\n\n326.\n\nThe Claimants submitted their statement of cost on June 7, 2019.\n\n327.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its statement on costs on June 19, 2019.\n\n328.\n\nBy letter dated June 20, 2019 the Claimants argued that the ICSID Rules require that \"each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it *in the proceeding*...,\"342 and that the Respondent\u2019s submission does not permit an assessment of whether the costs claimed are reasonable or whether they were incurred in these proceedings. By way of example, the Claimants submit that Italy claims disbursements of EUR 60,000 described as \"costs (translation, expertize [sic], other expenses).\" The Claimants state, however, that all of the legal authorities submitted by Italy in these annulment proceedings, except four, were originally in English. There were no translations submitted. No expert report was submitted, either. It is not apparent how such disbursements could qualify as costs borne in these proceedings.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter to Committee, June 20, 2019, citing ICSID Arbitration Rule 28(2). Emphasis added. Under Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 53, this rule applies *mutatis mutandis* to annulment proceedings.\n\n329.\n\nThe Claimants also submits that \"[t]he same observations hold for other categories of costs claimed by Italy, which include (i) \u2018attendances (personal attendances, telephone, letters out/e-mail)\u2019 of EUR 250,000, (ii) \u2018legal fees\u2019 of EUR 300,000 and (iii) \u2018attendance at hearing\u2019 of EUR 30,000, for a grand total of EUR 640,000. [All of these] are well in excess of those incurred by the Claimants. These are round numbers, with no indication as to the basis on which they were calculated or whether the costs claimed have ever been paid.\"343\n\nClaimants\u2019 Letter to Committee, June 20, 2019, pp. 1-2.\n\n330.\n\nAs a consequence of the foregoing, the Respondent submitted its revised statement on costs on July 3, 2019.\n\n331.\n\nThe Claimants seek to recover the entirety of the costs of these proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the *ad hoc* Committee and the Centre, and all reasonable fees and expenses incurred by the Claimants in relation to these annulment proceedings, including the Claimants\u2019 legal fees and disbursements (USD 375,000.00 for fees and costs paid to ICSID and \u20ac479,616.60 for legal fees and disbursements).\n\n332.\n\nThe Respondent seeks to recover their legal fees and costs incurred in these proceedings, totaling USD 618,065.62 (USD 616,000.00 as legal fees and USD 2,065.62 incurred for attendance at the Hearing).\n\n333.\n\nThe costs of the annulment proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\nCommittee\u2019s fees and expenses\n\nProf. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez 88,703.86\n\nMr. Makhdoom Ali Khan 53,604.72\n\nProf. Hi-Taek Shin 58,313.70\n\nICSID\u2019s administrative fees 116,000.00\n\nDirect expenses 20,214.57\n\n**Total** **336,836.85**\n\n334.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Claimants.\n\n**B. The Committee\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n----------------------------------------\n\n335.\n\nThe Committee has discretion as for the allocation of cost under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, applicable to these proceedings in accordance with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention. Additionally, Regulation 14(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations applies. It accordingly decides as follows.\n\n336.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, as well as Regulation 14(3)(e), grants the Committee discretion to allocate costs, fees and expenses incurred by (i) the disputing parties, (ii) ICSID, and (iii) members of this *ad hoc* Committee. Both disputing parties, by requesting the recovery of costs, fees and expenses seem to endorse the rule known as \"cost follow the event.\"\n\n337.\n\nIt has been recognized that \"there is no uniform practice in treaty arbitration with regard to the allocation of the costs of the arbitration.\"344 In the context of annulment proceedings it was stated that \"[i]n most of the decisions of annulment committees, the committees have decided that each party should bear its own litigation costs and that the costs of the proceeding should be borne equally by the parties.\"345 However, in a more recent decision it was observed that annulment committees have decided that the applicant should pay the costs when the annulment is refused.346\n\n*Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v.
