Procedure**\n----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 17 April 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\") against the Argentine Republic (\"the Respondent\" or \"Argentina\") from Aguas Argentinas S.A.(\"AASA\"), Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. (\"AGBAR\"), Vivendi Universal S.A. (\"Vivendi\") and AWG Group Ltd (\"AWG\"), (together, \"the Claimants\"). AASA is a company incorporated in Argentina. Suez, and Vivendi, both incorporated in France, AGBAR, incorporated in Spain, and AWG, incorporated in the United Kingdom, were shareholders in AASA. The Request concerned the Claimants\u2019 investments in a concession for water distribution and waste water treatment services in the city of Buenos Aires and some surrounding municipalities and a series of alleged acts and omissions by Argentina, including Argentina\u2019s alleged failure or refusal to apply previously agreed adjustments to the tariff calculation and adjustment mechanisms.1\n\nOn the same date, the Centre received two further requests for arbitration under the ICSID Convention regarding water concessions in Argentina from (i) Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez, and Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. and (ii) Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe, Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrales del Agua, S.A. regarding similar investments and disputes. As explained below, these requests would later be registered by the Centre and submitted by agreement of the parties to one same Tribunal.\n\n2.\n\nIn the Request, Claimants Suez and Vivendi, invoked Argentina\u2019s consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between France and the Argentine Republic (the \"Argentina-France BIT\")2 and AGBAR relied on Argentina\u2019s consent in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"Argentina-Spain BIT\").3 Claimant AWG invoked Argentina\u2019s consent to arbitrate investment disputes under the 1990 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the \"Argentina-UK BIT\")4, which provides in Article 8 (3) that in the event an investment dispute is subject to international arbitration Argentina and the investor concerned may agree to refer their dispute either to ICSID arbitration or to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL Rules\") and that failing such agreement after a period of three months the parties are bound to submit their dispute to UNCITRAL Rules arbitration. Although the required three months had elapsed without agreement, AWG in its Request for Arbitration invited Argentina to agree to extend ICSID arbitration to AWG\u2019s claims under the Argentina-UK BIT.\n\nAccord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Argentine sur l\u2019encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements (Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of France for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments), signed on 3 July 1991 and in force since 3 March 1993; 1728 UNTS 298.\n\nAcuerdo para la promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n rec\u00edprocas de inversiones entre el Reino de Espa\u00f1a y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic), signed in Buenos Aires on 3 October 1991 and in force since 28 September 1992; 1699 UNTS 202.\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Argentine Republic for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 11 December 1990, and in force since 19 February 1993.\n\n3.\n\nOn April 17, 2003, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the Request to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington D.C.\n\n4.\n\nOn July 17, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\"). The case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 with the formal heading of Aguas Argentinas S.A., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic.5 On that same date, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal. Argentina did not agree to extend ICSID jurisdiction to the claims of AWG but it did agree to allow the case, although subject to UNCITRAL rules, to be administered by ICSID.\n\nAs noted in footnote 1 supra, on this same date the Centre registered two further requests for arbitration regarding water concessions in Argentina: ICSID Case No. ARB/03/18 (Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez, and AGBAR v. Argentine Republic) and ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 (Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe, S.A., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and Interagua Servicios Integrales del Agua, S.A. v. Argentine Republic).\n\n5.\n\nThe parties could not reach an agreement on the number of arbitrators to comprise the arbitral tribunal nor on the method for their appointment. Accordingly, on September 22, 2003, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention; i.e. one arbitrator appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator, who would serve as president of the tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties. The Claimants appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as arbitrator. The Argentine Republic in turn appointed as arbitrator Professor Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela.\n\n6.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the parties on the name of the presiding arbitrator, by letter of October 21, 2003 the Claimants, invoking Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), requested the Centre to make this appointment. With the agreement of both parties, the Centre appointed Professor Jeswald W. Salacuse, a national of the United States of America, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn February 17, 2004, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal. The parties agreed that the same tribunal would hear and decide ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and the UNCITRAL arbitration initiated by AWG, along with two other cases involving water concessions in the provinces of Santa Fe (ICSID Case No ARB/03/17) and Cordoba (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/18).\n\n8.\n\nUnder ICSID Arbitration Rule 13, the Tribunal shall hold its first session within 60 days after its constitution or such other period as the parties may agree. The parties could not agree on a suitable date for the first session within the prescribed time limits. The Tribunal accordingly held its first session without the parties via telephone conference on April 19, 2004.\n\n9.\n\nOn June 7, 2004, the Tribunal held a session with the parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During the session the parties in ICSID case No. ARB/03/19 confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect. Similarly, in the case governed by the UNCITRAL Rules, AWG and Argentina also agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted.\n\n10.\n\nDuring the session the parties also agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal.6 The Tribunal, after consultation with the parties, fixed the following timetable for the written and oral pleadings in this case:\n\n*(1)*  ***Merits***  *(in the event Argentina raised no objections to jurisdiction):*\n\na. The Claimants would file a memorial on the merits on January 1, 2005;\n\nb. The Respondent would file a counter-memorial on the merits within one hundred and twenty (120) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 memorial;\n\nc. The Claimants would file a reply on the merits within sixty (60) days from their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial;\n\nd. The Respondent would file its rejoinder on the merits within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 reply; and\n\ne. The Tribunal would thereafter hold a hearing on the merits. The Tribunal envisaged holding this hearing on October 24-28, 2005 which dates the parties agreed to reserve for this purpose.\n\n*(2)*  ***Jurisdiction***  *(in the event Argentina raised objections to jurisdiction) :*\n\na. If the Respondent decides to file objections to jurisdiction, it would do so within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 memorial on the merits;\n\nb. Thereafter the proceedings on the merits would be suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3);\n\nc. The Claimants would file their counter-memorial on jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction; and\n\nd. The Tribunal would thereafter hold a hearing on jurisdiction. The Tribunal envisaged holding this hearing on May 11-12, 2005, which date the parties agreed to reserve for this purpose.\n\n*(3)* If the Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction or to join the question of jurisdiction to the merits of the dispute, the proceedings on the merits would be resumed and:\n\na. The Respondent would have for the filing of its counter-memorial on the merits the number of days equal to the original one hundred and twenty (120) less the number of days used for the filing of its objections to jurisdiction;\n\nb. The Claimants would then file their reply on the merits within sixty (60) days from their receipt of the Respondent\u2019s counter-memorial;\n\nc. The Respondent would file its rejoinder on the merits within sixty (60) days from its receipt of the Claimants\u2019 reply; and\n\nd. The Tribunal would then, in consultation with the parties as far as possible, fix a date for a hearing.\n\nDuring the session the parties agreed on a series of procedural matters related to the present cases and ICSID Cases Nos. ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/18. These agreements included a staggered schedule of written and oral submissions. A copy of the minutes of the session is enclosed as Annex. No.l to this Decision.\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed timetable, on January 1, 2005 the Claimants filed a joint Memorial on the Merits with accompanying documentation with respect to ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and the arbitration under UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules relating to the AWG claims. On February 28, 2005 Argentina filed its Memorial with objections to jurisdiction with respect to these two cases.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of March 17, 2005 the Tribunal confirmed the suspension of the proceedings on the merits in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3) and Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules. On April 6, 2005, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\n13.\n\nAs agreed upon during the June 7, 2004 session, a hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on May 11, 2005. Messrs. Nigel Blackaby and Lluis Paradell and Ms. Noiana Marigo, from the law firm of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP, Mr. Bernardo Iriberri, from the Buenos Aires-based law firm of Estudio Cardenas Cassagne y Asociados, Mr. Patrice Herbert from Suez Environnement and Mr. Miquel Gri\u00f1o, from AGBAR, attended the hearing on behalf of the Claimants. Mr. Ignacio Torterola from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, attended the hearing on behalf of the Respondent. Also present on behalf of the Respondent were Messrs. Alejandro Labado, Emilio Lentini, and Carlos Rivera, representing the Ente Tripartito de Obras y Servicios (ETOSS). During the hearing Messrs. Blackaby and Paradell addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Claimants. Mr. Torterola addressed the Tribunal on behalf of the Argentine Republic. The Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided in Rule 32(3) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and Article 25 of the UNCITRAL Rules.\n\n14.\n\nOn January 28, 2005, five non-governmental organizations, Asociaci\u00f3n Civil por la Igualidad y la Justicia (ACIJ), Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS), Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), Consumidores Libres Cooperativa Ltda, de Provisi\u00f3n de Servicios de Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria, and Uni\u00f3n de Usuarios y Consumidores, filed a \"Petition for Transparency and Participation as Amicus Curiae\" (the \"Petition\") with the Secretary of the Tribunal. Following the filing of the Petition, the Tribunal invited the parties to make any observations they might have in this regard, and both parties submitted their views on this matter. On May 19, 2005, the Tribunal issued an Order in Response to a Petition for Participation as Amicus Curiae (available online at ICSID\u2019s web site at www.worldbank.org/icsid) setting out the conditions under which the Tribunal would consider amicus curiae submissions.7\n\nA similar request was subsequently filed with the same tribunal by a nongovernmental organization and three named individuals in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17. The Tribunal\u2019s Order in Response to the Petition for Participation as Amicus Curiae of March 17, 2006, in that case is available online at ICSID\u2019s website www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n15.\n\nFollowing the hearing on jurisdiction, the Respondent at various times filed unsolicited documents and arguments further contesting the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. On each occasion, the Tribunal requested the Claimants views on these arguments and documents, and the Claimants totally rejected them each time. Finding that the Respondents had a full and complete opportunity to present their objections to jurisdiction in their memorial and oral arguments at the hearing on jurisdiction and finding further that the arguments presented in these unsolicited filings duplicated those that the Respondents had submitted in their oral arguments and memorial, the Tribunal by letter of March 24, 2006 requested the parties to refrain from making any new unsolicited submissions.\n\n16.\n\nBy letter of February 9, 2006, counsel for the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Claimant shareholders of AASA were in the process of selling their interests in AASA to third parties and that \"...in order to facilitate the required approval by the Republic of Argentina of such sale, AASA has decided to withdraw its claim in the above-referenced arbitration\" but that such withdrawal was expressly without prejudice to the Claimant Shareholders\u2019 claims in this proceeding. Upon invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent filed its observations to this withdrawal by letter of February 15, 2006. The Respondent did not object to the withdrawal of AASA but requested that the Claimant AASA provide the Respondent copies of the minutes of the shareholders\u2019 meeting *(Asamblea de Accionistas de AASA)* with respect to the decision authorizing such withdrawal. At the same time, Respondent advanced further arguments objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and asserting that AASA\u2019s decision to withdraw extinguished the claims of the other claimants in this case. At the invitation of the Tribunal, counsel for AASA provided copies of the minutes of the AASA\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting of February 8, 2006, authorizing the discontinuance of its claim before this Tribunal. At the same time, counsel for the Claimants rejected each of the Respondent\u2019s arguments challenging the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to the other Claimants. The Tribunal provided copies of these documents to the Respondent and requested its observation concerning AASA\u2019s withdrawal. By letter of March 31, 2006, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that \"... the Argentine Republic does not oppose the proposed cessation by the Concessionaire... AASA...\" in ICSID arbitration ARB/03/19 (\"... *la Rep\u00fablica Argentina no se opone al desistimiento planteado por la[s] Concesionaria^] AASA...\"),* (para. 9) but argued that such withdrawal had legal consequences with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the shareholder Claimants and their claims.\n\n17.\n\nIn its deliberations on this request, the Tribunal found that neither the ICSID Convention nor the Rules specifically provide for the withdrawal of one party from an arbitration proceeding that is to continue thereafter. ICSID Arbitration Rule 44, the provision of closest relevance to the action requested by the Claimant AASA, allows the discontinuation of an arbitration proceeding at the request of a party when the other party does not object. But Arbitration Rule 44 by a strict reading of its terms does not apply to the withdrawal of a single party. Nonetheless, the Tribunal, relying on Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which grants ICSID tribunals the power to decide procedural questions not covered by the Convention or the Rules, concluded that it had the power to order the discontinuance of proceedings with respect to one party at its request when the other party did not object. The Tribunal found that permitting such discontinuance in the conditions presented by this case was in accordance with the basic objective of the ICSID Convention of facilitating the settlement of investment disputes, of which ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 is a specific manifestation. It also was of the view that the continued participation of AASA in this proceeding would serve no useful purpose in bringing about a fair and correct resolution of the present arbitration.\n\n18.\n\nOn April 14, 2006, the Tribunal therefore entered Procedural Order No. 1 Concerning the Discontinuance of Proceedings with Respect to Aguas Argentinas S.A. (available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid), directing that: (i) the proceedings in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 with respect to the Claimant Aguas Argentinas S.A. be discontinued and that the said Claimant Aguas Argentinas S.A. cease to be a party with effect from April 14, 2006; and (ii) that the proceedings in ICSID Case No ARB/03/19 continue in all other respects. With respect to the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the withdrawal of AASA from the case had implications for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the shareholder Claimants and their claims, the Tribunal concluded that these objections were more appropriately addressed in its decision on jurisdiction. They are in fact considered in subsequent sections of the present decision.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal has deliberated on the parties\u2019 written submissions on the question of jurisdiction and on the oral arguments delivered in the course of the May 11, 2005 hearing. Since the parties pleaded ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 jointly with the UNCITRAL case of AWG v. Argentina and filed joint memorials relating thereto and since the facts and the legal questions in both cases are virtually identical, the Tribunal has determined that it is appropriate to issue a single Decision on Jurisdiction covering both cases. Having considered the relevant facts and evidence, the ICSID Convention, the UNCITRAL Rules, the Argentina-France BIT, the Argentina-Spain BIT, and the Argentina-U.K. BIT, as well as the written and oral submissions of the parties\u2019 representatives, the Tribunal has reached the following decision on the question of jurisdiction with respect to both cases.\n\n**II. Factual Background**\n--------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent is a federal republic consisting of the autonomous city of Buenos Aires and twenty-three provinces. Prior to the investment undertaken by the Claimants, the *Obras Sanitarias de la Nacion* (OSN), a state-owned company, had the responsibility of providing water and waste water services to City of Buenos Aires and certain surrounding municipalities.8\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits of 1 January 2005. para. 9 and Exhibit C2.\n\n21.\n\nIn 1989, Argentina enacted the State Reform Law9 that declared the country\u2019s public services to be in a state of emergency and proposed to launch a broad program of privatization to remedy the situation, by which the Argentine government would transfer the assets, operations, and functions of various designated State-owned companies and entities to private and primarily foreign investors. The State Reform Law also invited the country\u2019s provinces to participate in the privatization process. Subsequently, Argentina took certain other measures to attract private and foreign investment to its territory. Less than two years after the State Reform Law, Argentina adopted the Convertibility Law10 by which it tied or \"pegged\" the value of the Argentine Peso to the United States Dollar and established a currency board requiring that the amount of Argentine currency in circulation be equivalent to the foreign currency reserves held by the State. Starting in 1990, it also began to conclude bilateral treaties \"for the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments\" with various countries. By the year 2000, it had concluded 57 such bilateral investment treaties, commonly known as BITs, including the December 1990 Argentina-U.K. BIT, the July 1991 Argentina-France BIT, and the October 1991 Argentina-Spain BIT.\n\nLaw No. 23,696 of 18 August 1989 (the State Reform Law).\n\nLaw No. 23,928 of 27 March 1991.\n\n22.\n\nAs part of its reform and privatization program, Argentina enacted Decree No. 2074/90 of October 5, 1990 to establish a regulatory framework by which various designated public services, including OSN, would be privatized and transferred to private and foreign investors through a bidding process whereby they would be granted longterm concession agreements that would require the infusion by investors of new capital and technology.11 The federal government actively publicized its desire to privatize these services and made significant efforts, including a road show in Brussels, to interest particularly qualified foreign enterprises to invest in the privatized entities, preparing and distributing a prospectus toward this end.12 On June 30, 1992, the Argentine government issued Decree 999/92, known as the \"Water Decree\" to establish a regulatory framework for the privatization of OSN and to provide for the rights and obligations of the future concessionaire, the related regulatory bodies, and the users of the service.13 In order to attract the most experienced investors and to secure investment on the most favorable terms, the government established a rigorous international bidding process that included a prequalification procedure which would allow only the most financially and technically qualified enterprises to engage in actually bidding to take over the privatized public service. Based on the principles set down in the Water Decree, the Federal Ministry of Public Works and Services promulgated detailed Original Bidding Rules (*Pliego de Bases y Conditiones)* that stated the object, term and rules of the Concession, defined the bidding procedure, specified the rules concerning the concession contract, and also set out a model of the future Concession contract. These rules and the related model contract specified certain important provisions governing the financial aspects of the proposed concession, including investment commitments, tariff adjustments, and the equilibrium to be maintained between the costs of operation and the financial returns to the eventual successful concessionaire.\n\nDecreto Nro. 2074/1990, Bs. As., 03/10/1990.\n\nSee, e.g., The \"Information Memorandum\" issued by OSN, dated November 1991, Claimants\u2019 Exhibit C-19\n\nDecree No. 999/92 of 30 June 1992, BS. As. 18/06/1992.\n\n23.\n\nIn response to these measures, Suez, AGBAR, Vivendi and AWG, together with Argentine companies Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires S.A., Sociedad Comercial del Plata S.A., and Meller S.A., formed a consortium in 1992 to participate in the bidding for the concession to operate specified water distribution and waste water systems in the city of Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities. On December 9, 1992, the Government of Argentina awarded this consortium the concession to operate the water and waste water services system in the City of Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities, at that time the largest privatized water concession in the world. Pursuant to the bidding rules, the consortium subsequently formed an Argentine company, Aguas Argentinas S.A. (AASA) to hold and operate the concession. On April 28, AASA formally concluded a thirty-year concession contract with the Government, and on May 1, 1993 it assumed control and management of the designated water distribution and waste water systems. According to the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, by 2001 AASA had invested a total of USS 1.7 billion in the concession, consisting of US$120 million in AASA\u2019s initial capital, US$706.1 million primarily from multilateral lending institutions, and the remainder from cash flows generated by AASA.14\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, paras. 23-24.\n\n24.\n\nIn 1999, the Argentine Republic began to experience a severe economic and financial crisis that had serious consequences for the country, its people, and its investors, both foreign and national. In response to this continuing crisis, the government adopted a variety of measures to deal with its effects in the following years. In 2002, it enacted a law15 that abolished the currency board that had linked the Argentine Peso to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a significant depreciation of the Argentine Peso. Claiming that these measures injured their investments in violation of the commitments made to them in securing the concession, the Claimants sought to obtain from the Argentine government adjustments in the tariffs that AASA could charge for water distribution and waste water services, as well as modifications of other operating conditions.\n\nLaw No. 25,561 (Ley de Emergencia P\u00fablica y de Reforma del R\u00e9gimen Cambiario) of January 6, 2002.\n\n25.\n\nAfter a fruitless period of negotiations, the Claimants in April 2003 submitted their dispute with the Argentine Republic for settlement by arbitration to ICSID under the ICSID Convention pursuant to the Argentina-France and the Argentina-Spain BITs and, in the case of Claimant AWG, under UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules pursuant to the Argentina-U.K BIT. In their Memorial, the Claimants allege that the Argentine Republic is legally responsible under the above-mentioned BITs for its wrongful actions, which expropriated Claimants\u2019 investments in violation of Article 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT, Article V of the Argentina-Spain BIT, and Article 5(1) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT and which failed to treat Claimants\u2019 investments fairly and equitably in breach of Article 3 and 5(1) of the Argentina-France BIT, Article IV(1) of the Argentina-Spain BIT, and Article 2(2) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT. As a result, pursuant to the applicable BITs, Claimants seek compensation for their alleged loss. The Claimants at the initiation of this proceeding consisted of AASA (now withdrawn), the concession company, and four of its non-Argentine shareholders: Suez, a French company holding 39.93% of AASA shares; Vivendi, also a French Company, holding 7.55% of AASA shares; AGBAR, a Spanish Company holding 25.01% of AASA shares, and AWG, a U.K. company holding 4.25% of AASA shares.16 In addition, the shareholders hold various other financial obligations made by AASA.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, paras. 58-62.\n\n26.\n\nIn response to the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, the Respondent submitted a Memorial with objections to jurisdiction on February 28, 2005, alleging six specific grounds as to why ICSID and the present Tribunal are without jurisdiction to hear and decide Claimants\u2019 claim for damages. Certain of these objections apply only to Claimants Suez, Vivendi, and AGBAR, which are asserting ICSID jurisdiction, while others are applicable to all the Claimants. The purpose of the present Decision is to consider and decide upon each of the objections to jurisdiction raised by the Respondent. In undertaking this task, the Tribunal is mindful of the fact that other ICSID tribunals in other cases involving the Respondent have decided similar, if not identical jurisdictional issues, in particular this Tribunal\u2019s own Decision on Jurisdiction of 16 May 2006 in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 (Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and Inter Aguas Servicios Intergrales del Agua S.A v. the Argentine Republic) relating to investments in the concession to operate water distribution and waste water services in the Argentine Province of Santa Fe. While these decisions are not binding upon the present Tribunal, they are nonetheless instructive.\n\n**III. Consideration of Jurisdictional Objections**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n***First Jurisdictional Objection: The Dispute Does Not Arise Directly Out Of An Investment.***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nArticle 25 (1) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising*  *directly*  *out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre \"* (emphasis supplied).\n\nThe Respondent challenges ICSID\u2019s and this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on the ground that the underlying dispute between the Claimants Suez, AGBAR, and Vivendi, on the one hand, and the Respondent Argentina, on the other, does not arise directly out of an investment, as the ICSID Convention requires. The Respondent argues that in reality this dispute is about the wisdom of general economic measures taken by the government of Argentina to deal with the economic and financial crisis it was facing. In that light, according to the Respondent, the dispute in this case does not arise directly out of an investment, but rather out of the general measures adopted by the government. Further, Respondent argues that the word \"directly\" could also be \"translated\" as meaning \"specifically\" and that since none of the measures complained of were directed specifically at the Claimants\u2019 investments, but rather were measures of general applicability, it cannot be said that the dispute in the present case arises \"directly\" out of the Claimants\u2019 investment.17 In support of its position, the Respondent cites certain language from the NAFTA/UNCITRAL case of *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America18*\n\nRespondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 18.\n\nMethanex Corporation v. United States of America. 1st Partial Award, August 7, 2002, Respondent\u2019s Exhibit AL RA 3.\n\n28.\n\nClaimants Suez, AGBAR, and Vivendi assert that the Respondent errs when it states that they complain of general economic measures and that, in these circumstances, the dispute cannot arise directly out of investments as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, the Claimants complain that Argentina\u2019s measures specifically, concretely and directly violated commitments made to them as foreign investors in the privatized water industry, in particular Argentina\u2019s failure to reestablish the concession\u2019s financial equilibrium and to adjust tariffs. The Claimants further argue *that Methanex,* though not directly relevant to this case, actually supports their position in that the words \"relating to\" in Article 1101(1) of the NAFTA were interpreted to mean that \"there must be a legally significant connection between the measure and the claimant investor or its investment\". Moreover, this holding should be interpreted in conjunction with the rejection in *Pope & Talbot v. Canada,* another NAFTA case, of Canada\u2019s submission that \"a measure can only relate to an investment if it is primarily directed at that investment and that a measure aimed at trade in goods ipso facto cannot be addressed as well under Chapter 11.\"19\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 67 with citation.\n\n29.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept the Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Article 25(1) requires a connection of a sufficient degree of directness between a *dispute* submitted to ICSID and a claimant\u2019s *investment,20* The International Court of Justice has defined the word \"dispute\" to mean \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between parties.\"21 That a disagreement exists between the Claimants and the Respondent about law, facts, and legal views is beyond doubt. It is also beyond doubt (which the Respondent does not contest) that the Claimants have made an investment in certain water distribution and waste water systems in the city of Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities. The disagreement between Claimants Suez, AGBAR and Vivendi and the Respondent arises directly out of Claimants\u2019 investments in the water distribution and waste water systems in the city of Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities since the disagreement is specifically about the legality under international law of the treatment accorded to those investments by the measures taken by the Respondent. The Claimants allege that the treatment they have received violates Argentina\u2019s treaty obligations towards those investments, while the Respondent takes a different view. That disagreement arises directly out of the investment impacted by governmental measures, not out of the measures themselves. The Tribunal is not concerned with the wisdom, legality, or soundness of the policy measures taken by Argentina to deal with the economic crisis. Rather, the Tribunal\u2019s task is to judge, at the merits stage of this case, whether the effect of Respondent\u2019s actions on the Claimants\u2019 investments violates the Respondent\u2019s international legal obligations contained in the Argentina-France, the Argentina-Spain, and the Argentina-U.K. BITs. In short, the core of the dispute centers on a basic question: Did the Respondent by its actions violate the rights granted to the Claimants and their investments under international law?\n\nSee Christoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* 114 (2001).\n\nSee *Case concerning East Timor,* 1995 ICJ Reports 89, 99.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s proposed interpretation of the ICSID treaty that jurisdiction only exists if the measure in question was aimed or directed \"specifically\" at the investment finds no basis in the plain language of the treaty. First, the jurisdictional element demanded by the ICSID Convention is a dispute arising directly out of an investment. The Convention makes no reference to governmental measures as a jurisdictional element. To infer that requirement without justification in the face of the plain meaning of Article 25 of the Convention would do violence to the arbitral regime that was carefully put in place by its founders. Second, it would lead to results that were clearly not intended by the drafters of the Convention. For example, such an interpretation would exclude from ICSID jurisdiction disputes caused by a governmental act of general expropriation while a governmental act expropriating a specific investment would be within the jurisdiction of the Centre. The Respondent cites language from *Methanex v. United States of America* in support of its position. In the *Methanex* case, the tribunal was interpreting Article 1101(1) of the NAFTA whose fundamental jurisdictional requirement, unlike Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, applies the dispute settlement provisions of Chapter 11 to \" measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to: (a) investors of another Party [or] investments of investors of another party in the territory of a Party\" (emphasis supplied). An interpretation of that provision requires quite a different analysis from that required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Whereas NAFTA requires by its terms a connection between the investments and contested governmental measures, Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requires a direct connection between the investment and the dispute. As a result, the language from the *Methanex* case advanced by the Respondent is not relevant to an interpretation of Article 25.\n\n31.\n\nThe Tribunal finds support for its conclusion that the dispute in the present case is directly related to an investment in the ICSID case of *CMS v. Argentina22* which also addressed the question of whether the dispute in question arose directly out of an investment. In that case, the claimant, which had invested in the context of Argentina\u2019s privatization program in a gas distribution system, brought a claim in ICSID arbitration under the Argentina-U.S. bilateral investment treaty on the grounds that various economic measures taken by the government violated its rights under that BIT. In that case, as in the present dispute, Argentina challenged the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and ICSID on grounds, *inter alia,* that the dispute did not arise directly out of an investment and that the claimant was asking the tribunal to judge the validity of general economic measures. The tribunal in *CMS v. Argentina* rejected that objection to jurisdiction, stating that while it does \"not have jurisdiction over measures of general economic policy and could not pass judgment on whether they were right or wrong\", it did have jurisdiction \"...to examine whether specific measures affecting Claimant\u2019s investments or measures of general economic policy having a direct bearing on such investment have been adopted in violation of legally binding commitments given to the investor in treaties, legislation or contracts\"23. It further clarified its position by stating: \"[w]hat is brought under the jurisdiction of the Centre is not the general measures in themselves but the extent to which they may violate those specific commitments.\"24\n\nCMS Gas Transmission Co. v. The Republic of Argentina (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (July 17, 2003), 42 ILM 788 (2003); also available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid; Claimants\u2019 Legal Authorities No. 85.\n\nIbid at para. 33.\n\nIbid at para. 27\n\n32.\n\nOn the basis of its foregoing analysis, the Tribunal holds that the dispute between Claimants Suez, AGBAR, and Vivendi and the Respondent arises directly out of the Claimants\u2019 investment in the water distribution and waste water systems of the city of Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities and that therefore the Respondent\u2019s first objection to jurisdiction must fail. Although the parties did not address the issue specifically, the Tribunal also affirms, for the reasons stated above, that AWG\u2019s dispute with Argentina is a dispute with regard to an investment which arises within the terms of Article 8 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT, a necessary element for establishing UNCITRAL arbitration under the treaty.\n\n***Second Jurisdictional Objection: The Dispute Is Not A Legal Dispute.***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention not only requires as a jurisdictional element that a dispute arise directly out of an investment but it also requires that the dispute be a \"legal\" dispute (it is to be noted, with regard to AWG\u2019s claim that neither the UNCITRAL Rules nor the Argentina-U.K. BIT specifically mention as a jurisdictional requirement to international arbitration that an investment dispute be \"legal.\"). The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of ICSID and of the Tribunal on the grounds that the dispute which Claimants Suez, AGBAR, and Vivendi have submitted to arbitration is not \"legal\" in nature. It supports this position by pointing out that the Claimants\u2019 case is based upon Argentina\u2019s failure to adjust the tariff regime and to respect the equilibrium principle whereby Claimants would be assured a fair return on their investment, but that neither Argentine law nor the Respondent\u2019s contract with the Claimants imposes a legal obligation to do so. Consequently, the Respondent asserts that the dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent is a business or commercial dispute rather than a \"legal\" dispute required to establish ICSID jurisdiction. The Respondent further alleges that the dispute over the effects of the devaluation measures on the concession is one over policy and fairness (\"una cuesti\u00f3n de pol\u00edtica p\u00fablica y de equidad\", Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 52), hence not legal in nature.\n\n34.\n\nA legal dispute, in the ordinary meaning of the term, is a disagreement about legal rights or obligations. In its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Claimants assert that their claim is indeed based on legal rights - the legal rights granted to them under the Argentina-France and the Argentina-Spain BITs. They allege that, by failing to make tariff adjustments and to respect the equilibrium principle, the Respondent violated its legal obligations under the Argentina-France BIT to accord \"just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law\" to the Claimants and their investments and \" not [to] take, directly or indirectly, any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other equivalent measures having a similar effect of dispossession\" without payment of prompt and adequate compensation (Art. 3, 5(1), and 5(2)). They further allege that the Respondent also violated its legal obligations under the Argentina-Spain BIT to guarantee \"fair and equitable treatment of investments made\" by the Claimants and to pay compensation for \"the nationalization, expropriation or any other measures having similar characteristics or effects\" taken by Respondent (Art. IV(1) and V).\n\n35.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, the task of the Tribunal is not to judge the merits of these claims but to determine whether the claims made by the Claimants Suez, AGBAR and Vivendi are legal in nature and therefore constitute a basis for establishing ICSID jurisdiction. Furthermore, although the ICSID Convention itself does not define the meaning of \"legal dispute,\" the accompanying Report of the Executive Directors of the World Bank gives some clarification:\n\n*\"The expression \"legal dispute\" has been used to make clear that while conflicts of rights are within the jurisdiction of the Centre, mere conflicts of interests are* *not. The dispute must concern the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for breach of a legal obligation.\"25*\n\nReport of the Executive Directors on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, 1 ICSID Reports 28; also available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n36.\n\nIn his commentary on the ICSID Convention, Professor Schreuer characterizes legal disputes as follows:\n\n*\"The dispute will only qualify as legal if legal remedies such as restitution or damages are sought and if legal rights based on, for example, treaties or legislation are claimed. Consequently, it is largely in the hands of the claimant to present the dispute in legal terms.\"26*\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* 105 (2001).\n\n37.\n\nIn the present case, the Claimants Suez, AGBAR, and Vivendi clearly base their case on legal rights which they allege have been granted to them under the bilateral investment treaties that Argentina has concluded with France and Spain. In their written pleadings and oral arguments, the Claimants have consistently presented their case in legal terms. Bilateral investment treaties are not mere statements of good will or declarations of benevolent intent toward the investors and investments of the two countries concerned. They are international legal instruments by which sovereign states make firm commitments under international law concerning the treatment they will accord to investors and investments from the other State. A basic purpose of the Argentina-France BIT and the Argentina-Spain BIT, as their titles indicate, is the \"protection of investments.\" They seek to achieve this goal by granting investors and investments from the treaty partner certain legal rights and to provide a legal means for their enforcement. In the present case, the Claimants have invoked both BITs as a basis for their claim and have based their claims on the specific legal rights enumerated in specific treaty provisions, which they allege have been granted to them by the treaties in question. Whether they will prevail in establishing their legal rights and the Respondent\u2019s violation thereof remains to be seen and is for a subsequent stage of this proceeding. What is certain at this stage, however, is that the dispute as presented by the Claimants is legal in nature. As a result, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent\u2019s second objection to jurisdiction must also fail.\n\n***Third Jurisdictional Objection (now moot): AASA Does Not Qualify As A Foreign Investor Under The Applicable Treaty And, In Any Event, Has Not Consented To The Jurisdiction Of ICSID And Of The Tribunal.***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nAASA, one of the original Claimants in this dispute, is an Argentine corporation which formally holds the concession for water distribution and waste water treatment in the City of Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities and through which the other Claimants made their investments. Since AASA is not a foreign entity, but a national entity, the Respondent asserted that AASA is not entitled to bring a case to ICSID.\n\n39.\n\nIn response, the Claimants argued that AASA must be deemed a French investor because Suez, a French company, effectively controls AASA and that therefore it is to be deemed a French investor according to Article (l)(2)(c) of the Argentina-France BIT.\n\n40.\n\nSince the Tribunal, at the request of AASA and without opposition from the Respondent, has ordered the discontinuance of the proceedings in this case with respect to AASA in Procedural Order No. 1, discussed above, and since this third objection to jurisdiction relates to and affects only AASA and none of the other Claimants, the Tribunal has concluded that it need not consider and decide upon this objection to jurisdiction.\n\n***Fourth Jurisdictional Objection: Claimants\u2019 Right To Bring An Action In Arbitration Is Precluded By The Dispute Resolution Clause in the Concession Contract Concluded By AASA.***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nThe contract granting AASA a concession to operate the water distribution and waste water systems in the City of Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities contained a dispute resolution clause whereby the parties to the contract agreed to submit all disputes relating to its interpretation and execution to the federal administrative courts in the City of Buenos Aires.27 From this fact, the Respondent draws two implications challenging ICSID and the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. First, the dispute resolution clause, according to the Respondent, shows that AASA did not agree to ICSID or UNCITRAL jurisdiction, thus vitiating a fundamental jurisdictional element of both arbitration systems: consent. Second, by agreeing to settle all disputes arising out of their transaction, including those that are the basis for the present arbitration, in the courts of Argentina, not before an ICSID or UNCITRAL tribunal, both the Claimants and the Respondent agreed to settle their disputes in a manner which necessarily excludes recourse to international arbitration.\n\nContrato de Concesi\u00f3n dated 28 April 1993, between the National State and Aguas Argentinas S.A. Art\u00edculo 15.4 (Jurisdicci\u00f3n): A los efectos de la interpretaci\u00f3n y ejecuci\u00f3n de este Contrato, las partes se someten a la jurisdicci\u00f3n exclusiva de los tribunales en lo contencioso administrativo federal de la Cuidad de Buenos Aires.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants object that arbitral tribunals have consistently rejected arguments relating to the preclusive effect of contractual dispute resolution clauses providing for the jurisdiction of local courts where breaches of the BITs were alleged and that they do not claim any contractual right or assert any cause of action under the concession contract. In support of their position, the Claimants rely in particular on decisions in other ICSID cases involving Argentina, namely *CMS v. Argentina, Enron v. Argentina, Azurix v. Argentina, Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A.* and *Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux v. Argentina,* as well as on other decisions such as *Salini v. Morocco and CME Czech Republic B. V. v. The Czech Republic.* The Claimants further specify that their claims are for breach of the treaty protection and not for breach of contract. In this respect, they gave particulars of the principles and provisions of the concession contract solely to explain the investment regime that Argentina established in order to attract foreign investments.\n\n43.\n\nIn order to assess the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objection on this point, one must consider the nature and implications of the dispute settlement clause concluded by AASA and Argentina. By its terms, the dispute resolution clause covers all controversies arising out of the concession contract. The dispute resolution clause makes no mention of Claimants\u2019 rights under the Argentina-France BIT, the Argentina-Spain BIT, the Argentina-U.K. BIT, or their right to seek recourse in international arbitration for violation of those rights. In the present case, the Claimants, as they rightly point out, do not allege any violation of their rights under the concession contract. Rather, the basis of their claim is that the Respondent has violated the Claimants\u2019 rights under the applicable BIT. BIT claims and contractual claims are two different things. As the ICSID Annulment Committee stated in *Vivendi,* which involved one of the BITs at the center of the present dispute:\n\n*\"A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and vice versa*\n\n*\"[...] whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions. Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law - in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract by the proper law of the contract [...]28*\n\nCompa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux) v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment (3 July 2002) paras. 95 and 96. Available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\n44.\n\nMany other international arbitral tribunals have taken the position that a dispute resolution clause in an underlying contract whereby contractual disputes are within the exclusive jurisdiction of local courts or arbitrations does not preclude an investor who is a party to such contract from bringing an arbitration proceeding to enforce its rights under a bilateral investment treaty.29\n\nE.g., Lanco International Inc. v. The Argentine Republic, (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/6), Preliminary Decision on Jurisdiction, at sections 39-40; Salini Costruttori SpA and Italstrade v. Kingdom of Morocco, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4, Decision on Jurisdiction, (23 July 2001) at para. 62; Azurix Corp, v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Jurisdiction (8 December 2003), at para. 76.\n\n45.\n\nIt follows from the above discussion that, contrary to Argentina\u2019s argument, the execution of a dispute resolution clause in the concession agreement does not mean that the parties have waived ICSID or UNCITRAL jurisdiction. Certainly, the execution of a dispute settlement clause, like the one in the AASA concession contract, which makes no reference to the BIT or to the treatment that the BIT guarantees investors, cannot support any inference that such dispute resolution clause is a waiver of the investors\u2019 rights under a BIT. The Tribunal concludes that the existence of the dispute resolution clause in the concession contract does not preclude the Claimants from bringing the present arbitration. Consequently, Respondent\u2019s fourth objection to the ICSID\u2019s and this Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction must fail.\n\n***Fifth Jurisdictional Objection: Suez, Vivendi, AGBAR, and AWG As Mere Shareholders Of AASA Are Not Legally Qualified To Bring Claims In International Arbitration For Alleged Injuries Done To AASA***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the four AASA shareholders, Suez, Vivendi, AGBAR, and AWG, have no standing to bring a claim in arbitration for alleged injuries done to AASA. In support of this position, the Respondent, drawing analogies to domestic corporation law, argues that any injury to the shareholders is derivative of the alleged injury to the company in which they hold shares, as opposed to a direct injury to the shareholders themselves. The alleged injury is done to the corporation, not to the shareholders whose shares, because of an alleged wrongful action done to the corporation, may have diminished in value. Thus, the shareholders have no right to bring an action on grounds that they have sustained a direct injury by virtue of the alleged wrongful actions of the Respondent. The right to bring an action for any alleged injury lies with the corporation itself, not its shareholders. The Respondent further pointed out that to award a monetary recovery to the Claimants in their capacity as shareholders, as well as to AASA as the entity directly wronged, would result in an unjust double recovery and moreover would grant a recovery to specific shareholders, thus prejudicing other shareholders as well as AASA creditors. The Respondent also reiterated this argument at the time that the Tribunal, at the request of AASA to withdraw from this case and without objection from the Respondent, ordered the discontinuance of the proceedings with respect to AASA. In its submissions of March 31, 2006, the Respondent argued that the shareholder Claimants\u2019 claims were dependent or derivative of AASA\u2019s claim and that since AASA was no longer a party, the Claimant shareholders had no right to bring a claim in ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitration in the absence of AASA.\n\n47.\n\nIn response, the Claimants argue that the basis for a shareholder having standing to bring a case because of an alleged injury is to be found in international law, not domestic law. Specifically, it is to be found in the Argentina-France, the Argentina-Spain, and the Argentina-U.K. BITs which were concluded by the countries concerned to protect the investors and investments of one State in the territory of another State. Suez and Vivendi are French nationals under the Argentina-France BIT and as such fall within the definition of the term \"investor\" in Article l(2)(b). Under Article 8 of the Argentina-France BIT, an \"investor\" may have recourse to ICSID arbitration with respect to \"... any disputes relating to an investment under this Treaty.\" Article 1(1) contains a quite detailed definition of investment. It provides in part:\n\n*1. The term \"investment\" shall apply to assets such as property, rights and interests in any category, and particularly but not exclusively to:...*\n\n*b) Shares, issue premiums and other forms of participation, albeit minority or indirect, in companies constituted in the territory of either Contracting Party... \"30*\n\nUnited Nations Treaty Series, volume 1728, p. 298. The official Spanish text of the above-quoted provisions is as follows:  \n 1. El t\u00e9rmino \"inversiones\" designa los activos tales como los bienes, derechos e intereses de cualquier naturaleza y, en particular, aunque no exclusivamente:  \n b) las acciones, primas de emisi\u00f3n y otras formas de participaci\u00f3n a\u00fan minoritarias o indirectas, en las sociedades constituidas en el territorio de una de las Partes Contratantes.  \n The official French text of the quoted provision is as follows:  \n 1. Le terme \u00abinvestissement\u00bb d\u00e9signe des avoirs tels que les biens, droits, et int\u00e9r\u00eats de toute nature, et plus particuli\u00e8rement mais non exclusivement:  \n b) Les actions, primes d\u2019\u00e9mission et autres, formes de participation, m\u00eame minoritaires ou indirectes aux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s constitu\u00e9es sur le territoire de l\u2019une des Parties contractantes;\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimants likewise refer to Article 1(2) of the Argentina-Spain BIT which defines investments as \"any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind [...]\", including \"shares and other forms of participations in companies\"31 and to Article 1(a) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT which states that \"investment\" means \"every kind of asset defined in accordance with the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made and admitted in accordance with this Agreement and in particular, though not exclusively, includes... (ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a company, established in the territory of either of the Contracting Parties;...\" The Respondent has not suggested anywhere in its pleadings that shares in a company are not \"assets\" under its laws.\n\nIbid.\n\n49.\n\nAccordingly, under the plain language of these BITs, the Tribunal finds that the AASA shares owned by all four Claimants were \"investments\" under the Argentina-France, Argentina-Spain, and the Argentina-U.K. BITs. These shareholders thus benefit from the treatment promised by Argentina to investments made by French, Spanish, and U.K. investors in its territory. Consequently, under Article 8 of the French treaty and Article X of the Spanish treaty, these shareholder Claimants are entitled to have recourse to ICSID arbitration to enforce their treaty rights. Similarly, under Article 8(3) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT, Claimant AWG is entitled to have recourse to UNCITRAL arbitration to enforce its treaty rights. Neither the Argentina-France BIT, the Argentina-Spain BIT, the Argentina-U.K. BIT, the ICSID Convention and Rules, nor the UNCITRAL Rules limit the rights of shareholders to bring actions for direct, as opposed to derivative, claims. This distinction, present in domestic corporate law of many countries, does not exist in any of the treaties applicable to this case.\n\n50.\n\nDuring the oral arguments, the Respondent relied heavily on the International Court of Justice case *Barcelona Traction32* in which Belgium sought damages against Spain for injuries done to Belgian shareholders in a Canadian corporation that was operating an electricity distribution system in Barcelona. The Court held that Belgium lacked *jus standi* to exercise diplomatic protection of shareholders in a Canadian company with respect to measures taken against that company in Spain. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, *Barcelona Traction* is not controlling in the present case. That decision, which has been criticized by scholars over the years, concerned diplomatic protection of its nationals by a State, an issue that is in no way relevant to the current case. Unlike the present case, *Barcelona Traction* did not involve a bilateral treaty which specifically provides that shareholders are investors and as such are entitled to have recourse to international arbitration to protect their shares from host country actions that violate the treaty. In this regard, it is interesting to note the Id\u2019s commentary on the underdeveloped state of international investment law in 1970, the year of the Barcelona Traction decision:\n\n*\"Considering the important developments of the last half-century, the growth of foreign investments and the expansion of international activities of corporations, in particular of holding companies, which are often multinational, and considering the way in which the economic interests of states have proliferated, it may at first sight appear surprising that the evolution of the law has not gone further and that no generally accepted rules in the matter have crystallized on the international plane. \"33*\n\nAt that time, the movement to conclude bilateral investment treaties was in its infancy. Today, over 2200 bilateral investment treaties exist in the world, and Argentina alone has concluded fifty seven. Moreover, there exists today a growing jurisprudence of arbitral decisions interpreting investment treaty provisions, something which hardly existed in 1970. The applicable international law on investment between Argentina and France, Argentina and Spain, and Argentina and the United Kingdom found in the relevant BITs is much more specific and far reaching than was the case in 1970.\n\nCase Concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company (Belgium v. Spain), Judgment of 5 February 1970, 1970 I.C.J. 3.\n\nBarcelona Traction Company (Belgium v. Spain), 1970 I.C.J. 3, 46-47 (1970).\n\n51.\n\nRelying on the specific language of each BIT, which gives shareholders the right to have recourse to arbitration to protect their shares, the Tribunal finds that Suez, Vivendi, and AGBAR have standing to bring an ICSID arbitration and that AWG has standing to bring an UNCITRAL arbitration. Many other decisions in ICSID cases, including a good number involving Argentina, have made similar holdings.34 While the Respondent\u2019s concern about the danger of double recovery to the corporation and to the shareholders for the same injury is to be noted, the Tribunal\u2019s decision at this point relates only to jurisdiction. Moreover, the Tribunal believed that any eventual award in this case could be fashioned in such a way as to prevent double recovery. In any event, the withdrawal of AASA from the case vitiates any concerns about a possible double recovery to the shareholders and the corporation for the same injury in their proceedings. Finally, the Tribunal believes that the discontinuance of these proceedings with respect to AASA does not affect the rights of the shareholder Claimants to bring claims in arbitration under the three BITs in question. The Claimant shareholders would have had a right to bring such claims independently without the participation of AASA in first instance. The initial participation of AASA and its subsequent withdrawal do not alter the Claimant shareholders\u2019 rights. According to Art. 1 (1)(b) of the Argentina-France BIT, Article 1(2) of the Argentina-Spain BIT, and Article 1(a) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT (quoted above, para. 47 and 48), shares fall within the definition of investments protected by the BITs. AASA\u2019s withdrawal cannot erase the legal effects of the shareholders\u2019 investment nor affect their *ius standi* under the BITs. As a consequence, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent\u2019s fifth objection to jurisdiction fails.\n\nE.g., CMS Gas Transmission Company v. the Republic of Argentina (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8). Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (17 July 2003); Enron Corporation & Ponderosa Assets, LP v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Decision on Jurisdiction (14 January 2003) ; Siemens A.G. v. The Argentine Republic (ICSID No ARB/02/8), Decision on Jurisdiction (3 August 2004).\n\n***Sixth Jurisdictional Objection: Since Claimants AGBAR And AWG Respectively Have Not Complied With The Provisions Of The Argentina-Spain BIT And The Argentina-U.K. BIT Requiring Submission Of An Investment Dispute To Local Courts Before Invoking International Arbitration, They Have No Standing To Have Recourse To International Arbitration At This Time.***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nClaimant AGBAR, a national of Spain, seeks to assert its claims under the Argentina-Spain BIT, and Claimant AWG presses its claim under the Argentina-U.K. BIT. Unlike Article 8(2) of the Argentina-France BIT, which allows an investor to have recourse to international arbitration after a period of six months of negotiation from the time it asserts its claim, Article X of the Argentina-Spain BIT requires the investor, at the end of the same six month period, to bring a judicial proceeding in the local courts and allows it to have recourse to arbitration only after a further period of eighteen months in the local courts. Similarly Article 8(2) of the Argentina-U.K BIT allows the investor to have recourse to international arbitration only after a period of eighteen months has elapsed from the time the dispute was submitted to a local court of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made. Neither AGBAR nor AWG has pursued their claims by litigation in Argentina\u2019s courts. As a result, the Respondent argues that these two Claimants have no standing at the present time to pursue their cases before this tribunal. In response, the Claimants argue that by virtue of the most-favored-nation clause in the Argentina-Spain BIT, AGBAR may take advantage of the more favorable treatment provided in the Argentina-France BIT with respect to dispute resolution and that therefore they may bring their action to ICSID without first pursuing their claims in the local courts of Argentina. Similarly, AWG asserts that it may have recourse to UNCITRAL arbitration because the most-favored-nation clause in the Argentina-U.K. BIT allows it to have the benefit the more favorable treatment provided in the Argentina-France BIT with respect to dispute resolution. The Respondent opposes this interpretation of the Argentina-Spain and Argentina-U.K. BITs, arguing that the most-favored-nation clause in both treaties does not include matters relating to investment dispute settlement.\n\n53.\n\nA decision on this objection requires the Tribunal, as with Respondent\u2019s other objections, to begin with an interpretation and analysis of the relevant BIT provisions. Article IV of the Argentina-Spain BIT, entitled *\"Tratamiento\"* (Treatment) is relied upon by AGBAR as obviating the need to have recourse to Argentine courts before bringing an international arbitration. The first three paragraphs of Article IV provide as follows:\n\n*1. Cada Parte garantizar\u00e1 en su territorio un tratamiento justo y equitativo a las inversiones por inversores de la otra Parte.*\n\n*2. En todas las materias regidas por el presente Acuerdo, este tratamiento no ser\u00e1 menos favorable que el otorgado por cada Parte a las inversiones realizadas en su territorio por inversores de un tercer pa\u00eds.*\n\n*3. Este tratamiento no se extender\u00e1, sin embargo, a los privdegios que una Parte conceda a los inversores de un tercer Estado en virtud de su participaci\u00f3n* *en:*\n\n*\\* Una zona de libre cambio*\n\n*\\* Una uni\u00f3n aduanera*\n\n*\\* Un mercado com\u00fan*\n\n*\\* Un acuerdo de integraci\u00f3n regional, o*\n\n*\\* Una organizaci\u00f3n de asistencia econ\u00f3mica mutual en virtud de un acuerdo firmado antes de la entrada en vigor del presente Acuerdo que prevea disposiciones an\u00e1logas a aquellas que son otorgadas por esa Parte a los participantes de dicha organizaci\u00f3n. \"*\n\nThe English translation of this provision in the United Nations Treaty Series is as follows:\n\n*1. Each Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of investments made by investors of the other Party.*\n\n*2. In all matters governed by this Agreement, such treatment shall be no less favorable than that accorded by each Party to investment made in its territory by investors of a third country.*\n\n*3. Such treatment shall not, however, extend to the privileges which either Party may grant to investors of a third State by virtue of its participation in:*\n\n*- A free trade area;*\n\n*- A customs union:*\n\n*- A common market;*\n\n*- A regional integration agreement; or*\n\n*- An organization of mutual economic assistance by virtue of an agreement concluded prior to the entry into force of this Agreement, containing terms similar to those accorded by that Party to participants of said organization. \"*\n\n54.\n\nIn interpreting these provisions, the Tribunal is guided by established principles of treaty interpretation as provided by Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, pursuant to which treaty language is to be interpreted in accordance with its \"ordinary meaning.\" In that respect, the text of the treaty is presumed to be the authentic expression of the parties\u2019 intentions. The starting place for any exercise in interpretation is therefore the treaty text itself.\n\n55.\n\nThe text quoted above clearly states that \"in all matters\" *(en todas las materias)* a Contracting party is to give a treatment no less favorable than that which it grants to investments made in its territory by investors from any third country. Article X of the Argentina-Spain BIT specifies in detail the processes for the \"Settlement of Disputes between a Party and Investors of the other Party.\" Consequently, dispute settlement is certainly a \"matter\" governed by the Argentina-Spain BIT. The word \"treatment\" is not defined in the treaty text. However, the ordinary meaning of that term within the context of investment includes the rights and privileges granted and the obligations and burdens imposed by a Contracting State on investments made by investors covered by the treaty. In the present situation, Argentina concluded a BIT with France which permits aggrieved investors, after six months\u2019 of attempting to resolve their disputes to have recourse to international arbitration without the necessity of first bringing a case in the local courts of a Contracting State. Consequently, French investments in Argentina, as a result of the Argentina-France BIT, receive a more favorable treatment than do Spanish investments in Argentina under the Argentina-Spain BIT. That being the case, by virtue paragraph (2) of Article IV, Spanish investments are entitled to a treatment with respect to dispute settlement no less favorable than the one accorded to French investments. In specific terms, granting a treatment to Spanish investments that is no less favorable than that granted to French investments would mean that the holders of Spanish investments would be able to invoke international arbitration against Argentina on the same terms as the holders of French investments. That is to say, Spanish investors, like French investors, may have recourse to international arbitration, provided they comply with the six months negotiation period but without the need to proceed before the local courts of Argentina for a period of eighteen months.\n\n56.\n\nThe language of the most-favored-nation clause in the Argentina-U.K. BIT, relied upon by AWG, differs from that of the Argentina-Spain BIT. Article 3 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT provides:\n\n*National Treatment and Most-favored-nation Provisions*\n\n(1) *Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment less favorable than that which it accords to investments or returns of its own investors or to investments or returns of investors of any third state.*\n\n(2) *Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment less favorable than that which it accords to its own investors or to investors of any third state.*\n\nLike the Argentina-Spain BIT, Article 7 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT, contains a list of matters that are excepted from most-favored-nation treatment. Dispute resolution is not among them.\n\n57.\n\nDespite the difference in language of the most-favored-nation clauses in the two BITs, the Tribunal believes an interpretation of each leads to the same result. The Argentina-U.K. BIT, like the Argentina-Spain BIT, does not define the word \"treatment.\" The Tribunal gives that word the same interpretation in the two treaties: the rights and privileges granted and the obligations and burdens imposed by a Contracting State on investments made by investors covered by the treaty. Paragraph (2) of Article 3 of the Argentina-UK BIT, quoted above, states that a Contracting state may not subject an investor to a treatment less favorable with respect to \"the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investment\" than it accords to investors from other countries. The right to have recourse to international arbitration is very much related to investors\u2019 \"management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of their investments.\" It is particularly related to the \"maintenance\" of an investment, a term which includes the protection of an investment. Thus French investors by virtue of the Argentina-France BIT having the right to proceed directly in international arbitration without the necessity of first submitting their claims to local courts are treated more favorably with respect the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and disposal of their investments than U.K. investors who may not. That being the case, U.K. investors may invoke the most-favored-nation clause in the Argentina-U.K. BIT to order to obtain the more favorable treatment accord to French investors.\n\n58.\n\nArgentina contests this interpretation on various grounds. First it argues that the Contracting States did not intend the most-favored-nation clause in Article IV of the Argentina-Spain BIT or Article 3 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT to cover dispute settlement. The Tribunal finds no evidence in the BIT texts or elsewhere to support that conclusion. The text of the both BITs strongly implies just the opposite. Paragraph 3 of Article IV in the Argentina-Spain BIT and Article 7 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT contains a definite list of matters that the Contracting States specifically *excluded* from the most-favored-nation clause. Dispute settlement is not among them. The failure to refer among these excluded items to any matter remotely connected to dispute settlement reinforces the interpretation that the most-favored-nation clause includes dispute settlement. In negotiating the Argentina-Spain BIT, the Contracting States considered and decided that certain matters should be excluded. The fact that dispute settlement was not covered among the excluded matters must be interpreted to mean that dispute settlement is included within the term \"all matters\" in paragraph 2. A similar argument applies to the Argentina-U.K. BIT which in its provisions excluding certain matters from its most-favored-nation clause makes no mention of dispute settlement. Moreover subsequent U.K.. BITs make clear through express language that the United Kingdom\u2019s intent is not to exclude dispute settlement from the coverage of the U.K.. BIT\u2019s most-favored-nation clause. United Kingdom BITs concluded after 1993, for example with Honduras, Albania, and Venezuela, each add a third paragraph to the two paragraphs (quota above in para 56), constituting its most-favored-nation clause:\n\n(3) *For the avoidance of doubt it is confirmed that the treatment provided in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement. \"*\n\nThe inference to be drawn from this language is that this new paragraph, by its terms, is intended to clarify what had been the United Kingdom\u2019s preexisting intention in negotiating its BITs: that the most-favored-nation clause is to cover all the articles (i.e. Articles 1 to 11) of the treaty.\n\n59.\n\nAfter an analysis of the substantive provisions of the BITs in question, the Tribunal finds no basis for distinguishing dispute settlement matters from any other matters covered by a bilateral investment treaty. From the point of view of the promotion and protection of investments, the stated purposes of both the Argentina-Spain BIT and the Argentina-U.K. BIT, dispute settlement is as important as other matters governed by the BITs and is an integral part of the investment protection regime that the respective sovereign states have agreed upon. In this context, the Respondent further argues that this Tribunal should apply the principle of *ejusdem generis* in interpreting the BITs so as to exclude dispute settlement matters from the scope of the most-favored-nation clause, because the category \"dispute settlement\" is not of the same *genus* as the matters addressed in the clause. The Tribunal finds no basis for applying the *ejusdem generis* principle to arrive at that result.\n\n60.\n\nSimilarly, Argentina contends that the Tribunal should interpret the most-favored-nation clauses strictly because such an approach would restrict the principle of *res inter alios acta,* so as to limit the effects of the treaty to the parties. The Tribunal cannot follow this argument. The BITs in question contain mutual promises by Argentina and Spain and Argentina and the United Kingdom to treat each others\u2019 nationals in the same way that they treat nationals from any third State. The principle of *res inter alios acta* has no application, because the Tribunal is not applying the Argentina-France BIT (presumably the alleged act between third parties) to this case. Rather it is applying the provisions on equality of treatment of the Argentina-Spain BIT and the Argentina-U.K. BIT.\n\n61.\n\nFurther, the Respondent seems to argue that the Tribunal should interpret a most-favored-nation provision strictly. Here too, the Tribunal finds no rule and no reason for interpreting the most-favored-nation treatment clause any differently from any other clause in the two BITs. The language of the two treaties is clear. Applying the normal interpretational methodology to Article IV of the Argentina-Spain BIT, the Tribunal finds that the ordinary meaning of that provision is that matters relating to dispute settlement are included within the term \"all matters\" and that therefore AGBAR may take advantage of the more favorable treatment provided to investors in the Argentina- France BIT with respect to dispute settlement. Similarly, in the case of the Argentina-U.K. BIT, rights with respect to dispute settlement \"regard\" the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and disposal of an investment as stated in Article 3 of the treaty; consequently, AWG may also take advantage of the more favorable treatment that the Argentina- France BIT accords to French investors.\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal finds strong support for its conclusions in previous ICSID cases. In particular, *Maffezini v. Spain*35 applied the Argentina-Spain BIT, the very treaty at issue in the present case, to find that the most favored-nation-clause allowed the Claimant, a national of Argentina, to take advantage of Spain\u2019s BIT with Chile to avoid the necessity of having recourse to the local courts in Spain before bringing an ICSID action. The most relevant passages of Maffezini are worth quoting in full because they well show the rationale behind the application of the most-favored nation clause to dispute settlement:\n\n*\"The Tribunal considers that there are good reasons to conclude that today dispute settlement arrangements are inextricably related to the protection of foreign investors, as they are also related to the protection of rights of traders under treaties of commerce. Consular jurisdiction in the past, like other forms of extraterritorial jurisdiction, were considered essential for the protection of rights of trader and, hence, were regarded not merely as procedural devices but as arrangements designed to better protect the rights of such person abroad. It follows that such arrangements, even if not strictly a part of the material aspect of the trade and investment policy pursued by* *treaties of commerce and navigation, were essential for the adequate protection of the rights they sought to guarantee.*\n\n*International arbitration and other dispute settlement arrangements have replaced these older and frequently abusive practices of the past. These modern developments are essential, however, to the protection of the rights envisaged under the pertinent treaties; they are also closely linked to the material aspects of the treatment accorded. \"36*\n\nThese considerations then lead the *Maffezini* tribunal to conclude with the following words:\n\n*\"[I]f a third-party treaty contains provisions for the settlement of disputes that are more favorable to the protection of the investor's rights and interests than those in the basic treaty, such provisions may be extended to the beneficiary of the most favored nation clause as they are fully compatible with the ejusdem generis principle. \"37*\n\nEmilio Agustin Maffezini v. the Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (25 January 2000); available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\nIbid., para. 54-55.\n\nIbid. para. 56.\n\n63.\n\nOther cases that have considered and rejected arguments similar to the ones raised by Argentina in the present case and found that the most-favored-nation-clause allows a claimant to take advantage of more favorable dispute resolution provisions found in other treaties are in particular *Siemens A.G. v. the Argentine Republic38 and MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd and MTD Chile SA v. Republic of Chile.39*\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, in particular para. 102: \"Access to these [dispute settlement] mechanisms is part of the protection offered under the Treaty. It is part of the treatment of foreign investors and investment and of the advantages through the MFN Clause\"; available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid.\n\nICSID Case no. ARB/01/7, Award of 25 May 2004.\n\n64.\n\nIn opposition to this line of cases, the Respondent referred during oral argument to *Plama Consortium Limited v. the Republic of Bulgaria*.40 In that case, the Claimant, a Cypriot company, sought to establish ICSID jurisdiction on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty and of a BIT between Cyprus and Bulgaria. The tribunal affirmed ICSID jurisdiction under the Energy Charter Treaty; for various reasons, it also considered whether it had jurisdiction under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT. Such BIT contained a very limited international dispute settlement offer. In essence, it provided that only the measure of compensation for expropriation could be submitted to an UNCITRAL arbitration. It contained no offer for ICSID arbitration. It did, however, embody a most-favored-nation clause. Since other BITs concluded by Bulgaria provide for ICSID arbitration, the Claimant relied upon such most-favored-nation clause to take advantage of the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism included in the other BITs. The tribunal did not follow the Claimant and ruled that it lacked jurisdiction under the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT.\n\nPlama Consortium Limited (Claimant) and Republic of Bulgaria (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24), Decision on Jurisdiction (8 February 2005), available online at www.worldbank.org/icsid\n\n65.\n\nHaving duly considered the reasons set forth in the *Plama* decision, this Tribunal comes to the conclusion that, whatever their merits, that decision is in any event clearly distinguishable from the present case on a number of grounds. First, it must be noted that the most-favored-nation-clause in the Argentina-Spain BIT is much broader in scope than was the language of the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT in *Plama.* Whereas the Argentina-Spain BIT states that \"*[i]n all matters governed by this Agreement,.*..treatment shall be no less favorable than that accorded by each Party to investment made in its territory by investors of a third country\" (emphasis supplied), the comparable clause in the Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT stated that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall apply to the investments in its territory by investors of the other Contracting Party a treatment which is not less favorable than that accorded to investments by investors of third states.\" The use of the expression \"in all matters\" when coupled with a list of specific exceptions that does not include dispute resolution, leaves no doubt that dispute resolution is covered by the most-favored-nation clause. Similarly, the most-favored-nation clause in the Argentina-U.K. BIT, expressly enumerating the matters which it covers (i.e. \"management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments\") also provides greater specificity of coverage than does the clause being interpreted in *Plama.* Second, and perhaps more important, the *Plama* tribunal was guided by the actual intent of the contracting States. Subsequent negotiations between Bulgaria and Cyprus showed that the \"two Contracting Parties to the BIT themselves did not consider that the MFN provision extends to the dispute settlement provisions in other BITs\"41. This was in line with the fact that, at the time of conclusion of the BIT, *\"Bulgaria was under a communist regime, which favored bilateral investment treaties with limited protection for foreign investors and very limited international dispute resolution provisions.*\"42 No evidence of any comparable intent has been suggested in this case. Indeed, in regard to the Argentina-U.K. BIT, the inference to be drawn from the evidence of subsequent negotiating behavior of the United Kingdom Government, discussed in para. 58 above, is just the opposite of that in *Plama.* Third, as a further distinguishing factor, one may refer to the effect of the most-favored-nation provision. In *Plama,* the Claimant attempted to replace the dispute settlement provisions in the applicable Bulgaria-Cyprus BIT *in toto* by a dispute resolution mechanism incorporated from another treaty.43 Without expressing an opinion on whether a most-favored-nation clause may achieve such a result, this Tribunal distinguishes that radical effect from the much more limited one caused here, which merely consists in waiving a preliminary step in accessing a mechanism, i.e., international arbitration, offered in both the BITs under consideration in these cases.\n\nIbid., para. 195\n\nIbid., paras. 196.\n\nIbid., para. 210.\n\n66.\n\nThe *Plama* tribunal also stated, in its reasons, that an arbitration agreement must be clear and unambiguous, especially where it is incorporated by reference to another text.44 This Tribunal does not share this view. As stated above, it believes that dispute resolution provisions are subject to interpretation like any other provisions of a treaty, neither more restrictive nor more liberal.\n\nIbid., paras. 198ff.\n\n67.\n\nBe this as it may, at the end of its reasoning, the *Plama* tribunal suggested what could be called a \"non-sense exception\" to the non-application of the MFN clause. Addressing the very requirement at issue here, i.e., that the dispute be tried in local courts during eighteen months, which it called \"a curious requirement,\" the *Plama* tribunal said that it \"sympathize[d] with a tribunal that attempts to neutralize such a provision that is *nonsensical* from a practical point of view\" (emphasis supplied)45 It therefore concluded that \"[t]he decision in Maffezini is perhaps understandable.\"46\n\nIbid., para. 224.\n\nIbid., para. 224.\n\n68.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that AGBAR, relying on Article IV of the Argentina-Spain BIT, and AWG, relying on Article 3 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT, may invoke the more favorable treatment afforded in the Argentina-France BIT and may therefore bring an international arbitration without the necessity of first having recourse to the local courts of Argentina. The Respondent\u2019s sixth objection to jurisdiction therefore fails.\n\n**IV. Decision on Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nAfter having considered each and every jurisdictional objection raised by the Respondent, the Tribunal finds that it must reject them all, except for the fourth objection based on the status of AASA as an Argentine corporation, which objection has now become moot because of the discontinuance of the proceedings in the case with respect to AASA. The Tribunal thus decides that ICSID and this Tribunal have jurisdiction over ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the UNCITRAL arbitration of AWG and the Argentine Republic. The Tribunal therefore directs that the former case proceed on the merits in accordance with the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Rules, and the applicable bilateral investment treaties and that the latter case proceed on the merits in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the applicable bilateral investment treaty. The Tribunal has, accordingly, made the necessary Orders for the continuation of the procedure pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4) and Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2007-10-22T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. Background**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nOn April 17, 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\" or \"the first Request\") against the Argentine Republic (\"the Respondent\" or \"Argentina\") from Aguas Argentinas S.A.(\"AASA\"), Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. (\"AGBAR\"), Vivendi Universal S.A. (\"Vivendi\") and AWG Group Ltd (\"AWG\"), (together, \"the Claimants\"). AASA was a company incorporated in Argentina. Suez, and Vivendi, both incorporated in France, AGBAR, incorporated in Spain, and AWG, incorporated in the United Kingdom, were shareholders in AASA. The Request concerned the Claimants' investments in a concession for water distribution and waste water treatment services in the city of Buenos Aires and some surrounding municipalities and a series of alleged acts and omissions by Argentina, including Argentina's alleged failure or refusal to apply previously agreed adjustments to the tariff calculation and adjustment mechanisms.1\n\nOn the same date, the Centre received a further request for arbitration under the ICSID Convention regarding water concessions in Argentina from Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez, and Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. As explained below, this request would later be registered by the Centre and submitted by agreement of the parties to one same Tribunal, but that proceeding would eventually be discontinued following an agreement between the parties.\n\n2.\n\nAlso on April 17, 2003, the Centre received a second Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\" or \"the second Request\") against the Argentine Republic from Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A. (\"APSF\"), Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. (\"AGBAR\") and InterAguas Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. (\"InterAguas\" together, \"the Claimants\"). APSF was a company incorporated in Argentina. Suez, incorporated in France, and AGBAR and InterAguas, both incorporated in Spain, were major shareholders in APSF. This second Request concerned the Claimants' investments in a concession for water distribution and waste water treatment in the Argentine Province of Santa Fe and a series of alleged acts and omissions by Argentina, including Argentina's alleged failure or refusal to apply previously agreed adjustments to the tariff calculation and adjustment mechanisms.\n\n3.\n\nIn the first Request, Claimants Suez and Vivendi, invoked Argentina's consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between France and the Argentine Republic (the \"Argentina\u2013France BIT\")2 and AGBAR relied on Argentina's consent in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"Argentina-Spain BIT\")3. Claimant AWG invoked Argentina's consent to arbitrate investment disputes under the 1990 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the \"Argentina-UK BIT\")4, which provides in Article 8(3) that in the event an investment dispute is subject to international arbitration Argentina and the investor concerned may agree to refer their dispute either to ICSID arbitration or to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL Rules\") and that failing such agreement after a period of three months the parties are bound to submit their dispute to UNCITRAL Rules arbitration. Although the required three months had elapsed without agreement, AWG in its Request for Arbitration invited Argentina to agree to extend ICSID arbitration to AGW's claims under the Argentina-UK BIT.\n\nAccord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Argentine sur l'encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements (Agreement between the Gevernment of the Republic of France and the Government of the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments), signed on 3 July 1991 and in force since 3 March 1993; 1728 UNTS 298.\n\nAcuerdo para la promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n rec\u00edprocas de inversiones entre el Reino de Espa\u00f1a y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic), signed in Buenos Aires on 3 October 1991 and in force since 28 September 1992; 1699 UNTS 202.\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed 11 December 1990, and in force since 19 February 1993; Treaty Series No. 41 (1993).\n\n4.\n\nIn the second Request, the Claimants invoked Argentina's consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between France and the Argentine Republic (the \"Argentina\u2013France BIT\")5 and in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"Argentina-Spain BIT\").6\n\nAccord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Argentine sur l'encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements (Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of France for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments), signed on 3 July 1991 and in force since 3 March 1993; 1728 UNTS 298.\n\nAcuerdo para la promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n rec\u00edprocas de inversiones entre el Reino de Espa\u00f1a y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic), signed in Buenos Aires on 3 October 1991 and in force since 28 September 1992; 1699 UNTS 202.\n\n5.\n\nOn April 17, 2003, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (Institution Rules), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of both Requests to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington D.C.\n\n6.\n\nOn July 17, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered both Requests, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\"). The case relating to the first Request was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 with the formal heading of Aguas Argentinas, Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic. On that same date, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed, as soon as possible, to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal. Argentina did not agree to extend ICSID jurisdiction to the claims of AWG but it did agree to allow the case, although subject to UNCITRAL rules, to be administered by ICSID. Also on July 17, 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the second Request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention. This case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 with the formal heading of Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe S.A., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrales del Agua S.A. v. Argentine Republic.\n\n7.\n\nThe parties could not reach an agreement on the number of arbitrators to comprise the arbitral tribunals in these cases nor on the method for their appointment. Accordingly, on September 22, 2003, the Claimants requested the relevant Tribunals to be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention; *i.e.* one arbitrator appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator, who would serve as president of the tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties. The Claimants appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as arbitrator. The Argentine Republic in turn appointed as arbitrator Professor Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela.\n\n8.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the parties on the name of the presiding arbitrator, on October 21, 2003 the Claimants, invoking Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (Arbitration Rules), requested the Centre to make this appointment. With the agreement of both parties, the Centre appointed Professor Jeswald W. Salacuse, a national of the United States of America, as the President of the Tribunal. The Parties agreed that the same Tribunal would hear all three cases indicated above, in addition to a fourth case7 against Argentina involving the privatization of the water system in the Province of Cordoba, which was subsequently discontinued following an agreement between the parties.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/03/18.\n\n9.\n\nOn February 17, 2004, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. In connection with their appointment, each member of the Tribunal made declarations pursuant to Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules with respect to circumstances affecting reliability for exercising independent judgment.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 7, 2004, the Tribunal held a session with the parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During the session the parties in the ICSID cases confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect. Similarly, in the case governed by the UNCITRAL Rules, AWG and Argentina also agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted.\n\n11.\n\nHaving been duly constituted, the Tribunal under both ICSID and UNCITRAL Rules proceeded to hear the above entitled cases and to make a series of important decisions concerning their timetables and procedures on submission of documents, the jurisdiction of the tribunal8, requests by a group of non-governmental organization to participate as amicus curiae9, the withdrawal of certain parties, and various other matters concerning the orderly management and processing of the arbitral proceedings. From May 28 to June 1, 2007, the Tribunal with the full participation of the parties held a hearing on the merits in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17. With respect to ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and the case subject to UNCITRAL Rules, with the completion of the various phases for the submission of documents, the Tribunal with the agreement of the parties fixed the dates for a hearing on the merits in these cases for the period October 29 to November 8, 2007 at the offices of the Centre in Washington, DC.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, May 16, 2006.\n\nOrder in response to a Petition for Participation as *Amicus Curiae*, March 17, 2006.\n\n**II. The Proposal for the Disqualification of Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn October 12, 2007, the Respondent filed with the Secretary of the Tribunal a Proposal (hereinafter \"Respondent's Proposal\") underCONVENTION ON THE SETTLEMENT O and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to disqualify Professor Gabrielle Kauffman-Kohler as a member of the Tribunal \"\u2026 by virtue of the objective existence of justified doubts with respect to her impartiality.\" (para. 1) (\"\u2026en virtud de la existencia objetiva de dudas justificadas respecto de su imparcialidad.\") The alleged basis for this request arose out of the fact that Professor Kaufman-Kohler had been a member of an ICSID tribunal in the case of *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*10, hereinafter referred to as the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, which had rendered an award against Argentina on August 20, 2007.\n\n*Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3.\n\n13.\n\nThe *Aguas del Aconquija* case, which concerned a conflict between the parties arising out of the privatization of the water and sewage system in the Argentine province of Tucum\u00e1n in 1995, had a protracted history beginning with an ICSID arbitration initiated in 1996 which resulted in a an award in 2000, which was subsequently subject to a decision on annulment in 200211 which in turn led to the constitution of a new tribunal in April 2004, of which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, having been appointed by the claimants in the case, was a member. It was this tribunal that would render an award of $105,000,000, plus interests and costs, in favor of the claimants and against Argentina on August 20, 2007, and which has caused Argentina to seek to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler as an arbitrator in the three cases being considered by the present Tribunal. Argentina's Proposal, which will be discussed at length later in this decision, argues that the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case is so flawed, particularly in its findings of fact and its appraisal of the evidence, that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's very participation in that decision \"\u2026 reveals a prima facie lack of impartiality of the above mentioned arbitrator, made evident through the most prominent inconsistencies of the award that result in the total lack of reliability towards Ms Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler.\" (Respondent Proposal para. 8).\n\nDecision on Annulment, July 3, 2002 (English) (Spanish).\n\n14.\n\nOnce the Tribunal became aware of the Respondent's Proposal, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler immediately withdrew from Tribunal deliberations, and the two remaining members suspended proceedings in three above-entitled cases pursuant to Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules on October 15, 2007, forwarded the Respondent's Proposal to the Claimants with a request for their observations, and invited Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to furnish any explanations that she wished to make, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).\n\n15.\n\nBy letter of October 16, 2007, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler responded in part as follows:\n\n\"I do not wish to comment on the merits of the proposal, but to state that I have always considered it my duty as an arbitrator to be impartial and exercise independent judgment and that I intend to comply with such duty in these arbitrations as in all others in which I serve.\"\n\nThe Tribunal also forwarded Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's explanation to the parties for any comment they wished to make.\n\n16.\n\nOn October 17, 2007, the Claimants submitted a letter in which they requested that Argentina's challenge be dismissed and that the scheduled dates for the hearings on the merits be maintained. On October 17, 2007, Argentina submitted a new letter reaffirming its Proposal in the light of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's statement.\n\n17.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4) requires that in the event of a challenge to one member of an arbitral tribunal, \"\u2026the other members shall promptly consider and vote on the proposal in the absence of the arbitrator concerned.\" Professor Kaufman-Kohler having withdrawn from all deliberations of the Tribunal until the matter of the challenge against her is resolved, the undersigned other Tribunal members have considered the various documents submitted in this case, as well as the relevant legal authorities, and have arrived at the following decision.\n\n**III. Timeliness of the Respondent's Proposal**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nAn orderly and fair arbitration proceeding while permitting challenges to arbitrators on specified grounds also normally requires that such challenges be made in a timely fashion. As Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg has stated in his Report on Challenge Procedure, cited by Argentina in its proposal (footnote 39), handling challenges involves a balancing of interests the first of which is that \"\u2026 the arbitration should take place with due dispatch and the possibility of delaying tactics should be reduced to a minimum.\"12 Recognizing that such challenges may be abused, arbitration rules normally provide that challenges that are not timely should not be considered. In the three cases for which this Tribunal is responsible, two different sets of rules are applicable: the ICSID Convention and Rules in Case Nos. ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/19 and the UNCITRAL Rules in *Anglian Water Limited (AWG) v. The Argentine Republic*. We consider first the application of the UNCITRAL rules to the last-mentioned case.\n\nReprinted in T. Varady *et al*., *International Commercial Arbitration: A Transnational Perspective* (2nd ed, 2003) p. 381.\n\n19.\n\nArticle 11 of the UNCITRAL Rules governs challenges to arbitrators. Paragraph 1 of that article provides:\n\nA party who intends to challenge an arbitrator shall send notice of his challenge with fifteen days after the appointment of the challenged arbitrator has been notified to the challenging party or within fifteen days after the circumstances mentioned in articles 9 and 10 became known to the party.\n\n20.\n\nThe circumstances referred to in articles 9 and 10 are \"\u2026 any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his [*i.e.* the challenged arbitrator's] impartiality or independence.\"\n\n21.\n\nAccording to Argentina's Proposal, the circumstance that gave rise to such doubts was the issuance of the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case on August 20, 2007. It is undisputed that Argentina had knowledge of that award on that date. Therefore, under UNCITRAL Rules, the very latest that Argentina might have lodged a challenge against Professor Kaufmann-Kohler based on knowledge of that circumstance was September 4, 2007. Since the Tribunal did not receive Argentina's Proposal to challenge Professor Kaufmann-Kohler until October 12, 2007, some fifty-two days after Argentina had knowledge of the decision in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case and some thirty-eight days after the deadline specified by article 11(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules, its Proposal may not be considered under the UNCITRAL Rules and we therefore dismiss its challenge in the *Anglian Water Group (AWG) v. Argentina* case as being untimely.\n\n22.\n\nWith respect to the two ICSID cases to be decided by the Tribunal, neither the ICSID Convention nor the ICSID Rules specify a definite, quantifiable deadline beyond which a challenge is not to be considered. However, ICSID Rules are not without limits with respect to time. Article 9(1) of the ICSID Rules provides that:\n\nA party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General stating its reasons therefore. (emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Spanish language version of Rule 9 requires the challenging party to file its proposal *\"sin demora,*\" *i.e.* without delay. In the same vein, according to the French version of Rule 9, the proposal should be filed *\"dans les plus brefs d\u00e9lais.\"* The application of Rule 9(1) raises the question of whether Argentina filed its proposal \"promptly\" or \"without delay.\"\n\n23.\n\nThe word \"promptly\" is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as \"readily, quickly, directly at once, without a moment's delay.\"13 Webster's Unabridged Dictionary (2nd ed) in similar vein defines the term as \"readily, quickly, expeditiously.\"14 In his authoritative work on the ICSID Convention, Prof. Christoph Schreuer specifically addresses the question of the meaning of \"promptly\" with respect to challenges to disqualify an arbitrator. He states:\n\nPromptly means that the proposal to disqualify must be made as soon as the party concerned learns of the grounds for a possible disqualification.15\n\nUnder the ICSID Rules, the sanction for the failure to object promptly is waiver of the right to make an objection. Thus, Schreuer also writes:\n\nUnder Arbitration Rule 27, a party that fails to object promptly to a violation of a relevant rule is deemed to have waived its rights to object.16\n\nOxford English Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon Press; New York: Oxford University Press, 1989) p. 620.\n\nWebster's Unabridged Dictionary (New World Dictionaries/Simon and Schuster, 2nd ed, 1979) p. 1441\n\nC.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001) p.1198 (\u00a710).\n\nIbid. \u00a710.  \nArticle 27 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides:  \nA party which knows or should have known that a provision of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, of these Rules, of any other rules or agreement applicable to the proceeding, or of an order of the Tribunal has not been complied with and which fails to state promptly its objections thereto, shall be deemed\u2014subject to Article 45 of the Convention\u2014to have waived its right to object.\n\n24.\n\nDid Argentina act promptly in making its proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufman-Kohler as an arbitrator in the two cases governed by ICSID Rules? In paragraph 3 of its Proposal, Argentina defends the timing of its submission in the following terms:\n\n\"In spite of its submission being timely, the Republic of Argentina asserts that it attempted to make this proposal more time in advance. But one thing is the simple understanding of the arbitrariness committed in the award that concludes proceeding by some one who participates therein, and a very different one is to prepare a written submission for that understanding to be reached with certainty by someone who has not known the case.\"\n\n25.\n\nIn its letter of October 17 2007, Argentina added, as justification for its delay in filing the Proposal, that it needed some time for the analysis of the *Aguas del Aconquija* award and that:\n\n\"\u2026the Argentine Republic had to file the request for challenge while, at the same time, preparing for the hearing of this case, which entailed a major effort.\"\n\n26.\n\nWe can appreciate that an analysis of the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, a decision of 265 pages, as well as a review of the transcript and other documents, is a task that might require more than a day or two. On the other hand, Argentina's delay of fifty-three days in submitting its Proposal, a document of just 23 pages, does not constitute acting promptly given the nature of the case and the fact that hearings on the merits were scheduled to take place within two weeks of the submission. The Respondent's proposal does not develop elaborate legal arguments that would have necessitated extensive legal research and the selection of various errors from the hearing transcript is also not a task that would reasonably require nearly two months to be achieved. Moreover, to facilitate the efficient functioning of the arbitration, Argentina might have notified the Tribunal much earlier than it did of its intention to challenge one of the arbitrators, setting out its basic case on that issue, with supporting documents to follow at a later time. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we conclude that Argentina did not file its Proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler \"promptly\" within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the ICSID rules and that therefore it has waived such objection under Article 27.\n\n**IV. A Consideration of the Substance of the Respondent's Proposal of Disqualification**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nArticle 56 of the ICSID Convention governs the process of challenging arbitrators. It provides that a party may propose the disqualification of a member of the Tribunal on account of any fact indicating a *manifest* lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. (Emphasis added). Article 14 (1) states the qualities that an ICSID arbitrator must meet. It provides:\n\nPersons designated to serve on the Panels shall be persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the fields of law, commerce, industry or finance, *who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment.* (Emphasis added)\n\n28.\n\nThus, for purposes of deciding on Argentina's Proposal, it is essential to determine whether Professor Kaufmann-Kohler manifestly lacks the quality of being a person who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment, as Argentina seems to allege. Although Argentina did not point to this fact, the Spanish language version of the Convention Article 14(1) appears to be slightly different from that of the English language version. The Spanish version of Article 14(1) refers to a person who \"\u2026inspira[r] plena confianza en su imparcialidad de juicio. (*i.e.* who inspires full confidence in his impartiality of judgement.) Since the treaty by its terms makes both language versions equally authentic, we will apply the two standards of independence and impartiality in making our decisions. Such an approach accords with that found in many arbitration rules which require arbitrators to be both independent and impartial.17\n\nThe Rules of the London Court of International Arbitration (LCIA) state that arbitrators \"shall be and remain at all times impartial and independent of the parties.\" The International Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) state that \"[a]rbitrators acting under these rules shall be impartial and independent.\" The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules also emphasize the importance of both concepts, in relation to the appointing authority's obligations concerning selection of arbitrators, an arbitrator's duty of disclosure, and in relation to grounds for challenge.\n\n29.\n\nThe concepts of independence and impartiality, though related, are often seen as distinct, although the precise nature of the distinction is not always easy to grasp.18 Generally speaking independence relates to the lack of relations with a party that might influence an arbitrator's decision. Impartiality, on the other hand, concerns the absence of a bias or predisposition toward one of the parties. Thus Webster's Unabridged Dictionary defines 'impartiality' as \"freedom from favoritism, not biased in favor of one party more than another.\"19 Thus it is possible in certain situations for a judge or arbitrator to be independent of the parties but not impartial.\n\nOn this point, see Jean-Francois Poudret and S\u0117bastien Besson, *Comparative Law of International Arbitration* (Sweet and Maxwell, 2007 (translated by Berti & Ponti)), p. 348.\n\nWebster's Unabridged Dictionary (\\New World Dictionaries/Simon and Schuster, 2nd ed, 1979), p. 911.\n\n30.\n\nIndependence and impartiality are states of mind. Neither the Respondent, the two members of this tribunal, or any another body is capable of probing the inner workings of any arbitrator's mind to determine with perfect accuracy whether that person is independent or impartial. Such state of mind can only be inferred from conduct either by the arbitrator in question or persons connected to him or her. It is for that reason that Article 57 requires a showing by a challenging party of any fact indicating a manifest lack of impartiality or independence.\n\n31.\n\nWhat is the fact that Respondent alleges that manifestly demonstrates Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's lack of independence and impartiality? The only fact alleged in support of that conclusion is that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler participated in and signed the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, which was rendered on August 20, 2007. In that respect, Argentina's challenge to an arbitrator in this case is unlike such challenges in other many other cases.\n\n32.\n\nMany, if not most, prior ICSID cases concerning challenges to arbitrators are based on some alleged professional or business relation between the challenged arbitrator or one of his or her associates and a party in the case.20 That situation does not exist in the present case. The Respondent does not allege and certainly does not offer any evidence that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, her legal and professional associates, or anyone connected to her have or had any kind of a relationship at all with any of the parties in the case, let alone a relationship that might taint her independence as an arbitrator. As recognized by the other members of this Tribunal, as well as her professional associates, Professor Kaufman-Kohler is known as a distinguished university academic, lawyer, and arbitrator of the highest professional standing, and the Respondent offers no evidence or facts to challenge her reputation and standing, except for the fact that she was a member of the tribunal that unanimously rendered an award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case.\n\nSee for example Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Committee, Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), available online at http://www.worldbank.org/icsid/cases/9deci-e.pdf\n\n33.\n\nMoreover, it should also be noted that the Tribunal in the present case was constituted on February 17, 2004 and has functioned without objection from any of the parties for nearly four years in what was originally four and ultimately became three complicated cases. During that time, the Tribunal has held three hearings with the parties, made decisions on numerous requests and petitions, and has had countless interactions together and with the parties in order to carry out its functions according to the treaties and rules that govern its operations. Argentina offers no evidence whatsoever with respect to Professor Kaufman-Kohler's comportment during that period of time of any act or fact that would bring into question her independence or impartiality. Indeed, there can be none. On that score, the undersigned member of the Tribunal affirm in the strongest possible way based on their own knowledge and observation throughout that time that since the constitution of the Tribunal on February 17, 2004 Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler has conducted herself in accordance with the highest professional standards and with absolutely strict and uncompromising independence and impartiality.\n\n34.\n\nThus the only fact from which Argentina seeks to draw an inference of lack of impartiality and independence is that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler participated in and signed the award against Argentina in the *Aguas del Aconquija*. We turn now to consider the implications of that fact. At the outset, it must be recalled that Article 57 of the ICSID Convention requires a \"manifest lack of the qualities required\" of an arbitrator. The term \"manifest\" means \"obvious\" or \"evident.\" Christoph Schreuer, in his *Commentary*, observes that the wording *manifest* imposes a \"relatively heavy burden of proof on the party making the proposal\u2026\" to disqualify an arbitrator.21 Thus, in order to conclude that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler lacks independence or impartiality, we would have to find that participation in the award was in and of itself obvious evidence of such a state of mind. We have reviewed the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case but can find no evidence from its text of a lack of impartiality or independence by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler. The award was a unanimous decision rendered by three distinguished arbitrators, including one appointed by Argentina. In its Proposal, Argentina contests many of the findings of fact by that tribunal and it argues that because the tribunal's interpretations of the facts and evaluation of the evidence is, in the Argentinean view, so wrong, the tribunal, or at least Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, could not have acted independently and impartially in arriving at such a decision.\n\nC.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001) p.1200 (\u00a716).\n\n35.\n\nWith respect to the basis of Argentina's argument, it must be pointed out that a difference of opinion over an interpretation of a set of facts is not in and of itself evidence of lack of independence or impartiality. It is certainly common throughout the world for judges and arbitrators in carrying out their functions honestly to make determinations of fact or law with which one of the parties may disagree. The existence of such disagreement itself is by no means manifest evidence that such judge or arbitrator lacked independence or impartiality. Even if an appellate body should ultimately reverse such determination, that reversal in and of itself would by no means be evidence of a failure of impartiality or independence. A judge or arbitrator may be wrong on a point of law or wrong on a finding of fact but still be independent and impartial. We are in no way suggesting that we accept or dismiss any of Argentina's various challenges to the facts determined by the tribunal in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case. We are not equipped to make such a determination. We have not reviewed the thousands of pages of documents in that case, and we have not listened to the testimony of witnesses over eleven days as did the tribunal in the case. Determinations of facts in an arbitral or judicial proceeding are crucially dependent on an evaluation of the credibility of witnesses. The only persons capable of making that determination in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case were the three arbitrators who participated in the hearings and actually listened to the witnesses. While we, as two members of the Tribunal, have jurisdiction to judge the independence and impartiality of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, we have no jurisdiction to review the substance of the *Aguas del Aconquija* award.\n\n36.\n\nEven though Professor Kaufman-Kohler is independent of the parties, is it still possible to conclude that she is not impartial toward the parties, and specifically Argentina, because of her participation in the *Aguas del Aconquija* award? In more general terms, does the fact that an arbitrator or a judge has made a decision that a party in one case interprets as against its interests mean that such judge or arbitrator cannot be impartial to that party in another case? Further, does the fact that a judge or arbitrator had made a determination of law or a finding of fact in one case mean that such judge cannot decide the law and the facts impartially in another case? We believe that the answer to all three questions is no. A finding of an arbitrator's or a judge's lack of impartiality requires far stronger evidence than that such arbitrator participated in a unanimous decision with two other arbitrators in a case in which a party in that case is currently a party in a case now being heard by that arbitrator or judge. To hold otherwise would have serious negative consequences for any adjudicatory system.\n\n37.\n\nIt is also important to underscore that although the *Aguas del Aconquija* case and the cases being heard by the present Tribunal all involve Argentina as a respondent and arose out of the privatization of water and sewage systems in that country, the two situations are distinctly different. For one thing, the cases being heard by the present Tribunal are linked to the measures and actions taken by the Argentine government to deal with the serious crisis that struck the country in 2001. Those measures and actions were not in any way involved in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, which arose out of events some five years earlier. Secondly, the present Tribunal will be required to apply Argentina's bilateral investment treaties with Spain and the United Kingdom, neither of which was applicable in the *Aguas del Aconquija.* And finally, the application of general international legal principles, as well as the determination of damages (if any), are highly fact-specific, and the facts in the cases being heard by the present Tribunal are far different from those found in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case.\n\n38.\n\nAfter analyzing Argentina's various contentions in its Proposal, we find only Argentina's belief, unsubstantiated by objective evidence, that the award in the *Aguas del Aconquija* case, because of alleged improper findings of fact, is sufficient to demonstrate Professor Kaufmann-Kohler's lack of independence and impartiality. Paragraph 47 of Argentina's Proposal states: \"Based on all the considerations hereinabove stated, the Republic of Argentina asserts that it is manifest that Mrs. Kaufmann-Kohler may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment with respect to the Claimants' claim.\"\n\n39.\n\nAlthough Argentina does not ask the question specifically in its Proposal, the above-quoted statement raises the question of whether, in applying the standards of Article 14 of the Convention to challenges, one is to use a subjective standard based on the belief of the complaining party or an objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party. In other words, when the English version of article 14 calls for a person \"\u2026who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\" and the Spanish versions requires one \"...who inspires full confidence in his impartiality of judgment\" are we to look only to the challenger's belief or lack thereof in the presence of that quality or are we to require a showing of evidence that a reasonable person would accept as establishing the absence of the qualities required by Article 14? We have concluded that an objective standard is required by the Convention.\n\n40.\n\nImplicit in Article 57 and its requirement for a challenger to allege a fact indicating a *manifest* lack of the qualities required of an arbitrator by Article 14, is the requirement that such lack be proven by objective evidence and that the mere belief by the challenge of the contest arbitrator's lack of independence or impartiality is not sufficient to disqualify the contested arbitrator. Previous ICSID decisions on challenges to arbitrators support our position. For example, the Challenge Decision in the *SGS v. Pakistan* case22 confirmed this view in the following terms:\n\n[T]he party challenging an arbitrator must establish facts, of a kind or character as reasonably to give rise to the inference that the person challenged clearly may not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment in the particular case where the challenge is made.\"23\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13). Decision on Claimant's Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator of December 19, 2002, 8 *ICSID Rep.* 398 (2005)\n\nSGS Challenge Decision, page 5.\n\n41.\n\nTwo arbitrators in *Amco Asia Corp. v. Indonesia*24 held that mere appearance of partiality was not a sufficient ground for disqualification of the arbitrator. The challenging party must prove not only facts indicating the lack of independence, but also that the lack is 'manifest' or 'highly probable', not just 'possible' or 'quasi-certain'.25 The decision on the challenge to the President of the annulment committee in *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3) took a similar approach in stating that that the challenging party shall rely on established facts and \"not on any mere speculation or inference.\"26\n\nIndeed, the application of a subjective, self-judging standard instead of an objective would enable any party in arbitration who becomes discontented with the process for any reason to end it at any time at its sole discretion simply by claiming that an arbitrator is not independent or impartial, a result that would undermine and indeed destroy the system of investor-State arbitration that was so carefully established by the states that have agreed to the Convention.\n\nICSID Case ARB/81/1, Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify an Arbitrator (June 24, 1982) (unreported). Referred to in M.W. Tupman, *\"Challenge and Disqualification of Arbitrators in International Commercial Arsitration\"* 38 Int'l & Comp. L.Q. 44 (1989) p.44. The case is also referred to in C.H. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2001) p.1200 (\u00a718).\n\nIbid. p.45 (Decision at p.8).\n\nCompa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Challenge to the President of the Committee, para. 25.\n\n42.\n\nAfter carefully examining the various allegations contained in Argentina\u2019s Proposal, we find no evidence whatsoever that indicates in any way that Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler is not independent and impartial in the above-entitled cases. We therefore hold that the Proposal by Argentina to disqualify her is without foundation.\n\n**IV. Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n43.\n\nWe conclude that the Proposal by Argentina to disqualify Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler must be dismissed because it was not filed in a timely manner and because it failed to prove any fact indicating a manifest of lack of independence or impartiality. In making this decision, we have been mindful both of the sincerity with which Argentina has advance and argued its Proposal and the duty imposed on us by the ICSID Convention and Rules to decide this matter fairly and promptly in accordance with the prevailing law.\n\n44.\n\nAs from today, we terminate the state of suspension of the proceedings in the above entitled cases and affirm the schedule of hearings fixed by agreement of the parties to be held from October 28, 2007 through November 8, 2007 at the offices of the Centre in Washington, D.C."}, {"Title": "Decision on Liability", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2010-07-30T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Separate Opinion of Arbitrator Pedro Nikken (Decision on Liability)", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2010-07-30T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Separate Opinion of Arbitrator Pedro Nikken (Decision on Liability)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI agree that the State violated the standard of fair and equitable treatment when it failed to adjust tariffs for services provided by AASA, from the time of the consolidation of the recovery from the economic and social crises suffered by Argentina that started in late 2001 and early 2002.\n\n2.\n\nHowever, I disagree with the reasoning in the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions that the violation of fair and equitable treatment was due to the frustration of the legitimate expectations of the Claimants, the modification of the regulatory framework, and the renegotiation of the Concession decided by the State against the background of the 2001-2003 crisis. Despite the fact that my disagreement is in part only and does not exonerate Argentina for the violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, and despite the scholarly rank and renowned intellectual and moral quality of my colleagues in this Tribunal, for whom I have the utmost respect and esteem, I believe the points on which I dissent are sufficiently relevant to justify this vote. My disagreement with the reasoning in this Decision on Liability (the Decision) extends to recent awards that identify fair and equitable treatment with the protection of so-called \"legitimate expectations of the investor,\" which, in my opinion, goes beyond the normal meaning of the terms of the BITs and the intention of the parties.\n\n3.\n\nThe assertion that fair and equitable treatment includes an obligation to satisfy or not to frustrate the legitimate expectations of the investor at the time of his/her investment does not correspond, in any language, to the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms \"fair and equitable.\" Therefore, *prima facie,* such a conception of fair and equitable treatment is at odds with the rule of interpretation of international customary law expressed in Article 31.1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). In addition, I think that the interpretation that tends to give the standard of fair and equitable treatment the effect of a legal stability provision has no basis in the BITs or in the international customary rules applicable to the interpretation of treaties.\n\n4.\n\n\"Fair and equitable treatment\" is primarily a \"treatment,\" that is, a behavior, a conduct of each State Party when in the position of recipient of investment. That conduct must be \"fair and equitable.\" *In essence* fair and equitable treatment is a standard of *conduct* or *behavior* of the State *vis a vis* foreign investment. The conduct that each State Party to a BIT is willing and obliged to adopt for the promotion and protection of investments and, conversely, what each State is entitled to expect and does expect from the behavior of the other Party in the same situation.1\n\nI consider this a key aspect of fair and equitable treatment, which is not included in the characteristics as described in the Decision (para. 186), with which, incidentally, I agree: a) it is a vaguely and ambiguously defined standard, the scope of which is not defined in investment promotion and protection of foreign bilateral investment treaties (BITs); b) it is a standard widely used in hundreds of BITs worldwide; c) the terms defining the standard are flexible and apply to all types of investments and ventures; d) it is a factual standard, because its implementation is closely linked to the particular facts of each case so that judgment about what is fair and equitable cannot be formulated in the abstract but depends on the particular facts of the case; e) its extensive use in BITs, its generality and flexibility suggest that this is a standard developed by the Contracting States as the basic standard of treatment they are obliged to mutually grant to foreign investments protected under the BITs.\n\n5.\n\nWhat is the \"ordinary meaning\" that States could attribute to their obligation to behave in a \"fair and equitable\" manner with respect to investments from the other Party? Some arbitral tribunals have sought to adhere to the normal meaning, the ordinary meaning of what is \"fair and equitable\" in accordance with authoritative dictionaries. The *Azurix* Tribunal, following the *Oxford Dictionary,* concluded that *\"the terms fair\u2019 and \u2018equitable\u2019 used in Article 3(1) of the BIT mean \u2018just,\u2019 \u2018even-handed,\u2019 \u2018unbiased,\u2019 \u2018legitimate.'\"* In the Spanish version of the award, the expressions are taken from the Dictionary of the Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, with the same result: *fair and equitable* means *\" \u2018que obra con justicia y raz\u00f3n\u2019, \u2018arreglado a justicia y raz\u00f3n\u2019, \u2018que tiene equidad\u2019 y de ah\u00ed \u2019que obra con igualdad de \u00e1nimo\u2019. \"2* In relation to the same concept, the *MTD* Tribunal added that this obligation regarding behavior of the host State should not be construed as being merely passive or negative, but should include *\"treatment in an even-handed and just manner conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment. Its terms are framed as a pro-active statement \u2018to promote,\u2019 \u2018to create,\u2019 \u2018to stimulate\u2019 rather than prescriptions for a passive behavior of the State or avoidance of prejudicial conduct to the investors''3*\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award of July 14, 2006, para. 360. Similarly: *MTD Equity Sdn Bhd and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No ARB/01/7), Award of May 25, 2004, para. 113; *Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/02/8), Award of February 6, 2007, para. 290.\n\n*MTD v. Chile,* para. 113. Professor Schreuer, however, suggests that the fair and equitable treatment does not include positive obligations:\n\n*As a matter of substance, the content of two standards is distinguishable. The fair and equitable standard consists mainly of an obligation of the host State\u2019s part to desist from a certain course of action. By contrast, by promising full protection and security the host assumes an obligation to actively create a framework that grants security. The necessary measures must be capable of protecting the investment against adverse action by private persons as well as by State organs. In addition to physical protection, this requires the provision of legal remedies against adverse action affecting the investment and the creation of mechanisms of effective vindication of investors\u2019 rights.* (C. Schreuer: *Fair and Equitable Treatmente (FET): Interactions with other Standards.* Transnational Disputes Management. Volume 4, issue #05 - September 2007.\n\nHowever, while suggesting a reservation, the Ad Hoc Committee that decided on the annulment of the *MTD* award considered acceptable that part of the reasoning of the Tribunal:\n\n*\"... a standard formulated in the[se] terms[..j is defensible [...] the extent to which a State is obliged under the fair and equitable treatment standard to be pro-active is open to debate, but that is more a question of application of the standard than it is of formulation.*  ***In any event, the emphasis in the Tribunal\u2019s formulation is on \u2018treatment in an even-handed and just manner\u2019. \"***  *(**MTD v. Chile,* Decision on Annulment of February 16, 2007, para. 71. Emphasis added)\n\n6.\n\nThe NAFTA State Parties, for their part, made an interpretative statement on the scope of their obligation to accord a \"fair and equitable treatment\" to foreign investments they receive. That statement was a reaction to what they considered an incorrect interpretation by some arbitral tribunals, which went beyond what those States had considered the extent of their obligations under the treaty. This resulted in the binding interpretation of the NAFTA Free Trade Commission of July 21, 2001, which specifically stated that the concept of \"fair and equitable\" does not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the ***customary*** ***international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.*** The practice of some States is in line with this approach, as seen in their model BITs, as in the case of the United States (2004), Canada (2004), and Norway (2007). This has been reflected, for example, in free trade agreements of the United States with Singapore (Art. 15.5.2), Chile (Article 10.4), Australia (Art. 11.5), Central America and Dominican Republic (CFTA-DR (Article 10.5), and Morocco (Art. 10.5). Moreover, the US-Rwanda BIT 2008 includes a clarification in \"Annex A,\" the eloquence of which can only be explained as a prevention against the extravagance of arbitral jurisprudence on fair and equitable treatment and on the crystallization of customary international law:\n\n*The Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law \" generally and as specifically referenced in Article 5 and Annex B results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 54, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.5*\n\nWhere it is established that the FET does not require additional treatment or a treatment that goes beyond the minimum standard under customary international law.\n\nFootnote omitted\n\n7.\n\nIt is safe to assume that many developing countries agree with this interpretation. Conversely, no other State has made any statement to the effect of giving fair and equitable treatment a meaning different from the international minimum standard (let alone linking it to the \"legitimate expectations\" of investors and the stability of the legal environment for investment). In any event, the importance of NAFTA and of the economies of the United States and Canada cannot be underestimated when it comes to defining the issue. Nor should it be dismissed that the BITs to be negotiated in the future will be in line with the formulation of U.S. and Canadian models.\n\n8.\n\nI believe this point is of particular importance in this case, considering the language used in the BIT between France and Argentina. Under Article 3 of that treaty, the Parties undertook to give the investment they received *\"...just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law... \" (\"un tratamiento justo y equitativo conforme a los principios de Derecho Internacional\"', \"un traitement juste et \u00e9quitable conform\u00e9ment aux principes du droit international\").* This expression does not appear explicitly in the Argentina-Spain and Argentina-UK BITs, but cannot be neglected, as it is, in my opinion, a clear reference to the minimum standard, the only standard on \"treatment of aliens\" in general international law at the time when the treaty was concluded.\n\n9.\n\nArgentina relied on that interpretation in general terms. In its *Counter-Memorial,* Argentina argued in general terms that *\"the obligation of a fair and equitable treatment corresponds to the international minimum standard* (paras. 865 et seq.), and, referring to the Argentina-France BIT, said the reference to *\"*  *fair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of international law* *\u2019 [...] confirms that which is already implicit in the other BITs in any event, namely that the* *provision of the BIT is tied to the international minimum standard. \"* (Para. 875; emphasis in original). Accordingly, Argentina found no special significance in the difference in language between the three treaties because, from its point of view, in all the three treaties the standard of fair and equitable treatment corresponds to the international minimum standard, so that the treaty France-Argentina only *\"confirms\"* such general interpretation. Although this is a general statement and the Tribunal did not get the help it would have obtained if Argentina had developed a more comprehensive argument on the subject, I think the Tribunal should not have ignored this argument.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal dismissed the argument based on two reasons that I do not share. First, the Decision states that the French Treaty *\"refers simply to \u2018the principles of international law, \u2019 not to \"the minimum standard under customary international law \u2019. \"* Secondly, being that the formulation \" \u2018minimum international standard\u2019 is so well known and so well established in international law that one can assume that if France and Argentina had intended to limit the content of fair and equitable treatment to the minimum international standard they would have used that formulation specifically.\"6 In this context the Decision concludes that this expression of the Argentina-France Treaty does not entail a different content for the said treaty, since, as stated by the Court, referring to the applicable law to this case, in paragraphs 60-62 of the Decision, the Tribunal is bound to apply the principles of international law (para. 185).\n\nPara 184. This line of reasoning is suggested by Professor Schreuer: *\"...it is inherently implausible that* *a treaty would use an expression such as \"fair and equitable treatment\" to denote a well-known concept such as the \u2018minimum standard of treatment in customary international law \u2019. If the parties to a treaty want to refer to customary international law, it must be presumed that they will refer to it as such rather than using a different expression. \" (C. Schreuer, \"Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice, \" 6 J. World Investment and Trade 357 (2005), p. 360, also in F. Ortino, L. Liberti. A. Sheppard and H. Warner (Ed.), Investment Treaty Law. Current Issues II. Nationality and Investment Treaty Claims. Fair and Equitable Treatment in Investment Treaty Law.* British Institute of International and Comparative Law. London 2007, pp. 94-95.\n\n11.\n\nI disagree with that reasoning. Admittedly, with the exception of the latest USA, Canada and Norway model BITs, the generality of these treaties, including those that apply to this case, omit a specific relationship between the fair and equitable treatment and the minimum standard in general international law. This has led to the interpretation somewhat *a contrario,* applied by the Tribunal to this case, according to which that omission would prove that both standards are different, since the concept of minimum standard is well known and well established in international law, so that if the parties had intended to refer to it, would have explicitly mentioned.\n\n12.\n\nHowever, this reasoning does not mind the painful history of the minimum standard for weaker States. Indeed, the question of why there is no mention in the BITs (except in recent U.S., Canadian and Norwegian models) of the international minimum standard cannot be answered properly if the historical controversy on the concept of minimum standard is completely ignored, as done in the Decision. The concept of minimum standard was rejected by the Latin American countries since the nineteenth century and, in general, by all developing countries that emerged from Decolonization. It should be remembered that Latin America, most notably Argentina, was the birthplace of the Calvo Doctrine7 under which foreigners would enjoy in a country the same rights as nationals, but not superior rights. The same doctrine was accepted throughout the twentieth century by most developing nations, as evidenced by the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States, approved overwhelmingly by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 12, 1974,8 which accepted national treatment (and not the minimum standard), as applicable to the treatment of foreign investment (Art. 2.2.a) and cases of expropriation (Art. 2.2.c). The underlying claim of weaker States was well expressed, even in 1979, by Judge Padilla Nervo in his Separate Opinion in *Barcelona Traction:*\n\n*The history of the responsibility of States in respect of the treatment of foreign nationals is the history of abuses, illegal interference in the domestic jurisdiction of weaker States, unjust claims, threats and even military aggression under the flag of exercising rights of protection, and the imposing of sanctions in order to oblige a government to make the reparations demanded.9*\n\nC. Calvo: *Le droit international th\u00e9orique et pratique.* Paris 1896, vol. VI, pp. 231 et seq.\n\n(A/RES/ 29/3281).\n\nICJ, *Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited,* ICJ Reports (1970) 3, Separate Opinion of Judge Padilla Nervo, p. 246:  \n*L\u2019histoire de la responsabilit\u00e9 des Etats, en mati\u00e8re de traitement des \u00e9trangers, est une suite d\u2019abus, d\u2019ing\u00e9rences ill\u00e9gales dans l\u2019ordre interne des Etats faibles, de r\u00e9clamations injustifi\u00e9es, de menaces et m\u00eame d\u2019agressions militaires sous le couvert de l\u2019exercice des droits de protection, et de sanctions impos\u00e9es en vue d\u2019obliger un gouvernement \u00e0 faire les r\u00e9parations demand\u00e9es.*\n\n13.\n\nOne of the consequences or elements of the Calvo Doctrine was the **Calvo Clause,** which according to a contemporary author has been a \"hobbyhorse\" of Latin American countries for a long time.10 Another prominent present-day scholar has recognized that the *Calvo Doctrine* and the *Drago Doctrine* (both of Argentine origin) represented efforts by the Latin American countries \"to restrain the domination of the Great Powers.\"11 Similarly, a distinguished European professor has referred to the minimum standard as \"a legal disguise under which to protect the interests of powerful countries.\"12 The ICSID Convention and the widespread involvement of Latin American countries in BITs can be seen, in a way, as an implicit abandonment of the **Calvo Clause,** which is not entirely accurate, since that Clause was directed against diplomatic protection, which in the Latin American experience always resulted in an expression of domination by powerful countries of weaker countries. Theoretically, the system of ICSID and of the BITs is based on a relationship between equals that would not justify the fears that motivated Calvo, Drago, and their followers in Latin America, since in its conceptual design it is the result of treaties negotiated between equal States that agree in advance to submit investment disputes to arbitration.\n\nD.

It certainly was for the capital-exporting countries, but not for the rest of the world. The changes that took place in the last decades of the twentieth century, including the establishment of the internationalization of human rights and its applicable standards irrespective of nationality, well over *Neer* in 1926, outpaced the relevance of that debate, so the concept of international minimum standard as such, is no longer unacceptable to developing countries.\n\n15.\n\nHowever, although from the late twentieth century the debate on this concept could be considered overcome, the historical burden of its phrasing has not vanished. Clauses on the treatment of foreign investment referring to the \"international minimum standard\" could hardly be agreed upon, as some of the Parties to those treaties were not willing to accept it *expressis verbi.* \"International minimum standard\" was a \"forbidden phrase\" in a treaty for the very many countries that had rejected that standard, because it was associated with unjust international relations, as has been recognized by scholars who have addressed the issue.13 The explanation suggested by the NAFTA Free Trade Commission interpretation, which reveals the intention of the NAFTA Parties to consider fair and equitable treatment and international minimum standard as identical, was that a formula had to be found for saying the same thing but with different words, neutral words, which were not historically demonized. The phrase \"fair and equitable treatment\" is a neutral expression in relation to which there was no controversy and it had been used in another context in the Havana Charter signed in 1948 and in the Economic Agreement of Bogota, also signed in 1948.\n\nThe difficulty of developing countries, especially in Latin America, in accepting that the minimum standard is incorporated from customary international law, is noted by S. Vasciannie: *The Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law and Practice,* BYIL, Vol. 70, 1999, p. 105. Also: A. Newcombe, L. Paradell: *Law and Practice of Investment Treaties: Standards of Treatment.* Kluwer Law International. The Netherlands, 2009, p. 269.\n\n16.\n\nalso disagree with the reasoning in the Decision regarding the link between the fair and equitable treatment standard and the principles of international law referred to in Article 3 of the Argentina-France Treaty. According to the Decision, this is only a general reference to international law and only tells the Tribunal that this standard should be interpreted according to all sources of international law, in the same sense as specified in article 8.4 of the treaty. This ruling negates the effectiveness *(effet utile)* of the reference to principles of international law in Article 3 of that BIT and is consequently unreasonable. Indeed, as the Decision mentions when considering the applicable law to this case, Article 8.4 of the Argentina-France Treaty includes in the applicable law by the Tribunal *\"the relevant principles of international law \" (\"los principios del Derecho Internacional en la materia\"; \"des principes de droit international en la mati\u00e8re\").* This expression is to be read as a reference that ***all of the Argentina-France treaty must be construed in accordance with legal principles derived from all sources of international law.*** Therefore, the reference to the principles of international law contained in Article 3 cannot be interpreted as a simple and useless repetition of the general rule contained in Article 8.4, but should find a logical reason why the parties made such a specific reference. The most reasonable explanation is that the Parties considered fair and equitable treatment as a standard existing in international law at the time they signed and ratified the BIT, and the only one that existed at the time was the international minimum standard.\n\n17.\n\nThe significance of type of wording used in Article 3 of the BIT has been noted in arbitral cases14 and also in legal doctrine.15 Even an author cited by the Claimants in their *Reply* concurs with the above reasoning:\n\n*It cannot be excluded that a state, which has entered into a [fair and] equitable treatment commitment, would be firmly opposed to any reference to the minimum standard, given the ambiguous analogies this notion has at times allowed. If two states wish to refer to customary law, there is no dearth of established formulations to do so, as we have noted. In this way, a number of Conventions refer to a [fair and] equitable treatment in accordance with the law of nations;*  ***the mutual intention is in this case manifest, and does not present the same difficulties.***16 (Emphasis added).\n\n*Biwater Gaujf (Tanzania) Limited v.

This could be the result of the interaction between investment treaty law and customary law, provided of course that the conditions for crystallization of the latter have been met. In fact, some arbitral tribunals, such as the *Saluka* Tribunal, have suggested that the theoretical discussion on the relationship between the two standards is, in practice, superfluous, and *\"when applied to the specific facts of a case,*  ***may be more apparent than real.*** \"18 (Emphasis added). More recently, in *Biwater Gauff,* the tribunal concluded that *\"the actual content of the treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment is not materially different from the content of the minimum standard of treatment in customary international* law. \"19\n\nAs the *Mondev* Tribunal stated: *\"To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith! (Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF) 99/2. Award, October 11, 2002, para. 116)\n\n*Saluka BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic,* Partial Award of March 17, 2006, para. 291.\n\n*Biwater Gauff vs. Tanzania,* cit., para. 592.\n\n19.\n\nHowever, even as a *current minimum standard,* and even within the concept that has prevailed in recent doctrine and in decided cases in the sense that fair and equitable treatment is different from and independent of the customary minimum standard, it could never lose its essence as ***a standard of conduct or conduct of the State with respect to foreign investments,*** which should not automatically translate into a source of subjective rights for investors. The BITs contain a list of the States\u2019 obligations regarding their respective investments, not a declaration of rights for investors. Regardless of what is considered the autonomy of fair and equitable treatment with respect to the minimum standard, fair and equitable treatment represents the degree of *due diligence* that the States Parties to the BIT mutually pledged to observe with respect to the investments from nationals of both States. The language used in the French Treaty reinforces this interpretation, since the reference to the principles of international law can only be understood, at least, by prescribing an obligation of due diligence.\n\n20.\n\nHow far does the commitment of the States Parties in the BIT to treat the investments of the other Party in a fair and equitable manner go? It is unreasonable to assume that the States would have been willing to commit themselves beyond what the canons of ***good governance*** would require. With the propriety of the government *\"of a reasonably well-organized modern State.* \"20 On the contrary, it is illogical to understand that the intention of the Parties was to extend the protection of fair and equitable treatment that they undertook to give to the investments ***(not investors)*** of the other Party, above what is implied in good governance, just as it would be if treatment below what is expected from good governance were offered. The expectations of investors are not the appropriate instrument for measuring whether a government acted correctly or not according to the canons of a well-organized state. I think it is out of all proportion to interpret the fact that States committed to fair and equitable treatment to mean that they were going to compel their governments to submit to such a *test.*\n\n*\"...a reasonably well organized modern State. \" Asian Agricultural Products Ltd v Sri Lanka,* ICSID Case No ARB/87/3. Final Award on Merits and Damages. June 27, 1990;) para. 170.\n\n21.\n\nSimilarly, the *object and purpose* of BITs is not useful, in my opinion, to give the fair and equitable treatment meaning that is not present in the *terms of the treaty* in accordance with its *ordinary meaning.* Moreover, the international law on investment, as a whole has a purpose of protection which, therefore, invites an interpretation favorable to the protected object, but this does not allow to abandon the wording of the treaties or to redraft them. In my opinion, within the reasoning of the Decision, as with other cases that have followed a similar argumentation, there is an important link missing, because it does not explain why the object and purpose of the BITs can authorize the introduction therein of the concept of *legitimate expectations of investors,* which does not appear in any way, shape or form in the *terms of the treaty* according to its ordinary meaning. In interpreting an international treaty, the primary object of interpretation is to elucidate the meaning of the terms of the treaty so that when doing so in the light of its object and purpose the interpreter should not give these terms a meaning that is clearly outside their normal meaning, without any evidence that the intention of the Parties was to give a *special meaning* to the terms of the treaty (VCLT, Art. 31.4).\n\n22.\n\nThe concept of legitimate expectations is no stranger to the different legal systems, which, to varying degrees and on the basis of good faith, consider the party to a legal relationship that engages in self-contradiction to the detriment of the other party reprehensible. In human relationships, in general, your word is your bond and whoever betrays the trust of another must be penalized. However, the specific formulation of this concept varies in the different legal systems. Not even the English law concept of estoppel has a uniform wording or matches the same principle in other Anglo-Saxon countries. Neither is the doctrine of *actos propios* (close to estoppel) in the contract law of some civil law countries identical nor the doctrine of *confianza legitima (confiance legitime)* in the administrative law of those same countries. One of the areas where there are differences is in the threshold of trust that has to be achieved before the conduct of the party generating it is regarded as having betrayed that trust, for which damages must be paid insofar as the other party is injured thereby. In international law, in relations between States, this principle is embodied in *estoppel,* with which concept attempts have been made to connect fair and equitable treatment. I do not think indispensable to consider here whether, under international law, estoppel may be invoked by an individual who is not a subject of international law, against the State, or whether estoppel is confined to relations between the subjects of international law.21 Accepting for the sake of argument that estoppel could be invoked in the context of investment protection, the threshold required by international law is higher than a mere expectation. This has been established time after time by the jurisprudence of the International Court of Justice. The Court has referred repeatedly to the general requirements for *estoppel* to be invoked, one of these being the *conduct, statements, etc. of a State, that have clearly and consistently (d\u2019une mani\u00e8re claire et constante) evinced the State\u2019s acceptance of a particular regime.22* Or, as the Tribunal in Duke said:\n\n*... for the conduct or declaration of a state entity to be invoked as grounds for estoppel, it must be*  ***unequivocal,***  *that is to say, it must be the result of an action or* *conduct that,*  ***in accordance with the normal practice and good faith,***  *is perceived by third parties as an expression of the State's position, and as being incompatible with the possibility of being contradicted in the future23* (Emphasis in original))..\n\nIn *Duke v. Peru (Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1, ltd. v. Republic of Peru.* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28. Award of August 18, 2008), the Tribunal applied the principle of estoppel, but the problem to which I refer did not arise because, in the opinion of the Parties (and the Tribunal) in the case, the estoppel was complete correspondence in the *doctrina de los actos propios* applicable in Peruvian domestic law, particularly in Peruvian civil law, which governed the legal stability agreement on which the claim of the Claimants was founded (see para. 231).\n\n*North Sea Continental Shelf: Judgment, I.

Peru,* cit.; para. 249\n\n23.\n\nI believe that in some cases, ICSID tribunals have applied this principle without explicitly mentioning,24 but I find that the doctrine of so-called \"legitimate expectations\" is inconsistent or incorrect with respect to estoppel. If those expectations came from acts that reach the threshold required by international law to compel the State because of estoppel, the concept of legitimate expectations is irrelevant, but if they do not reach that threshold, there would be no basis in international law to assert a State obligation, because arbitral tribunals have no power to create a kind of *soft* estoppel, nor to assume that the *representation* of the Common Law is a general principle of international law.\n\nAlthough estoppel was not mentioned explicitly in *MTD* or *SPP (Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No ARB/84/3) Award of May 20, 1992), both cases involve the principle of estoppel. *la MTD,* the investor and the Chairman of the Foreign Investment Committee on behalf of Chile, had executed a contract for a housing development at a given site, after which the investor started the activity in question, but then the government denied permission as not being in conformity with its urban planning policy. In *SPP,* after the investor and Egypt had signed a contract for tourism development in a given site in the Pyramids area, the government canceled the permit because antiquities had been discovered at the site (which should have been foreseen by the government of Egypt, had it acted with due diligence). In both cases the investor had a vested right (not an expectation), which was destroyed for reasons exclusively attributable to the determination of the State. Furthermore, both cases present an inconsistency in the acts of the State in contravention of the general principle *nemo potest mutare consilium suum in alterius injuriam.*\n\n24.\n\nThe Decision is largely based on recent arbitral jurisprudence, which has identified fair and equitable treatment with safeguarding the \"legitimate expectations\" of investors. I disagree with the reasoning of the Decision according to which that jurisprudence fall within the provisions of Article 38.1.d of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, as *\"subsidiary means for the determination of rules of right\",* since it cannot be assumed that The Hague Court will accept as such the investment arbitral jurisprudence. I agree, however, with the notion that like cases should be resolved in the same manner or, as stated by a distinguished scholar and member of this Tribunal, although there is no legal obligation to follow decided cases there is indeed a moral obligation to follow decided cases in order to promote a predictable legal environment.25 However, great caution is needed when identifying cases as alike, especially when dealing with factual issues like fair and equitable treatment and when, moreover, the BITs often contain significant differences despite their similarity. Furthermore, I understand that moral obligation includes looking critically at decided cases, precisely because they are not binding. Or rather, because of that reason they are not binding.\n\n*Cfi* G. Kaufmann-Kohler: *Arbitral Precedent: Dream, Necessity or Excuse?* Arbitration International, Volume 23 Issue 3; p. 374.\n\n25.\n\nIn my opinion, arbitral awards linking fair and equitable treatment to the concept of \"legitimate expectations\" have not substantiated or explained how such an interpretation results from the application of the rules of international law contained in Article 31.1 of the VCLT. This notion arose from the *Teemed* award in a *dictum* that has been severely criticized, and has been repeated with variations in several decisions of ICSID tribunals in the past five years, as indicated in the Decision. This is not the time or the place to do a detailed critique of that jurisprudence, so I will limit myself to pointing out that, in my opinion, none of these decisions gives convincing reasons why the protection of investors\u2019 legitimate expectations can be considered included in the expression \"fair and equitable treatment\" by application of Article 31.1 of the VCLT. Neither the term, nor the concept of \"legitimate expectations\" appears in either BIT. The practice of States has been directed, rather, to rejecting the concept and to identifying fair and equitable treatment with the international minimum standard, as evidenced by the new model BITs of the United States, Canada and Norway as well as the binding interpretation of the NAFTA Free Trade Commission. I cannot find any arbitral decision that enquired about the intention of the parties when they made the commitment to give fair and equitable treatment to investments covered by BITs.\n\n26.\n\nMoreover, the very expression \"legitimate expectations\" is misleading and lends itself to confusion.26 If it means to refer to specific investment-related commitments that are later disavowed or disputed by the State, the violation of fair and equitable treatment is based on the improper conduct of the State with regard to the consistency of its actions, which is required by the canons of *good governance.* But if it refers to expectations with regard to general statements or general foreign investment promotion policy, there is no basis in the BITs or in general international law to consider them as a source of legally enforceable obligations.\n\nIn my opinion the definition attempted in *LG&E (**LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability of October 3, 2006, para. 130), which the Award seems to accept in this case is far from satisfactory, since it falls into new ambiguities, tautologies, and *petito principii.*\n\n27.\n\nI find, indeed, that the development of the doctrine of legitimate expectations is the result of the interaction of the claims of investors and their acceptance by arbitral tribunals, buttressed by the presumed moral authority of the decided cases. I believe that the standard of fair and equitable treatment has been interpreted so broadly that it results in arbitral tribunals imposing upon the Parties obligations that do not arise in any way from the terms that the Parties themselves used to define their commitments. Indeed, more attention has been paid to what the claimants have considered the scope of their rights than what the Parties defined as the extent of their obligations. Unfortunately, I have not had the intelligence or the ability to convince my colleagues in this Tribunal, in discussions that have been comprehensive, respectful and that have enriched our joint opinions, about the irrationality and the weakness of this jurisprudence, of which I am convinced.\n\n28.\n\nOn another matter, the Decision, also following some earlier decisions, concludes that the standard of fair and equal treatment was infringed because Argentina changed the regulatory framework of the concession as part of the Emergency Law enacted to address the serious economic, social and political crisis that erupted in late 2001 and early 2002. In my opinion, the interpretation that fair and equitable treatment includes an obligation of stability of the legal environment for investment is even more excessive than the doctrine of legitimate expectations.\n\n29.\n\nSome Tribunals have concluded that fair and equitable treatment includes stability of the legal framework of the investment, based on an extremely broad interpretation of the Preamble of some BITs concluded by the United States.27 I do not intend to formulate in this opinion my specific criticisms of that interpretation of the Preamble of the aforementioned BITs.28 I just emphasize that that interpretation is limited to the BITs whose preamble contains terms such as those that support the findings of those tribunals, which is not the case with Argentina\u2019s BITs with France, Spain and the United Kingdom, which govern these cases.29\n\nFor example: *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Republic of Ecuador.* London Court of International Arbitration. Administered Case No. UN 3467. Final Award of July 1, 2004, para. 183; *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Rep\u00fablica Argentina* (ICSID Case No.ARB/01/18), Award of May 12, 2005, para. 274.\n\nAs did the Tribunal in *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9), Award of September 5, 2008):  \n*Stability of the legal framework for investments is mentioned in the Preamble of the BIT.*  ***It is not a legal obligation in itself for the Contracting Parties, nor can it be properly defined as an object of the Treaty.***  *It is rather a precondition for one of the two basic objects of the Treaty, namely the promotion of the investment flow, rather than being related to its other objective, that of granting protection for investments on a reciprocal basis. Stability of the legal framework is undoubtedly conducive to attracting foreign investments, especially direct investments where business plans can extend over a number of years; and even more so in respect of those where initial investments are substantial and are recouped only over a long period of time. On the other hand,*  ***it would be unconscionable for a country to promise not to change its legislation as time and needs change, or even more to tie its hands by such a kind of stipulation in case a crisis of any type or origin arose.***  *Such an implication as to stability in the BIT\u2019s Preamble would be contrary to an effective interpretation of the Treaty; reliance on such an implication by a foreign investor would be misplaced and,*  ***indeed, unreasonable.***  *In any case, it is uncontested that the legal and regulatory regime for CNA\u2019s insurance business in general remained stable throughout the crisis.* (para. 258; Emphasis added).\n\nSurprisingly, one of those decisions, despite being explicitly based on the Preamble of the Argentina-USA BIT, has gone so far as to assert that *\"the stability of the legal and business framework in the State is an essential element in the standard for what is fair and equitable treatment\"* and that *\"the Tribunal considers this interpretation to be an emerging standard of fair and equitable treatment in international law A (LG&E Energy Corp. v. Argentina,* cit., para. 125).\n\n30.\n\nIt is possible for a State to explicitly assume the obligation of legal stability, particularly when domestic law so permits and the State conclude a \"legal stability agreement\" with the investor, as in the case of Peru for example.30 In other situations, the State assumes as a contractual obligation, through the concession contract for example, not to apply for an investment certain legislative amendments, such as those relating to income tax.31 But these are cases of specific and explicit obligations whose infringement is, by itself, a wrongful act which does not require invoking the fair and equitable treatment, let alone the \"legitimate expectations\", to explain the violation.\n\n*Cf. Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1, ltd. C. Republic of Peru.* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28 of August 18, 2008.\n\nThat was the case of *Revere* *Copper & Brass Inc. v. Overseas Private Investment Corporation,* Award August 24, 1978. (Claimants Legal Authorities No. 34). According to the Award, *\"(t)he 1967 Agreement* *prescribed the amount of taxes and royalties which were to be payable to the Government by RJA and provided, inter alia that*  ***no further taxes or financial burdens would be imposed on RJA and that the Government would do nothing to derogate from RJA's rights concerning the project. \"*** It was, therefore, an express contractual obligation.\n\n31.\n\nHowever, an international obligation that includes the State declining to exercise its regulatory power cannot be presumed, considering, as the Tribunal in *Myers* stated, *\"the high measure of deference that international law generally extends to the right of domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders. \"32* The regulatory power is essential to the achievement of the goals of the State, so to renounce to exercise it is an extraordinary act that must emerge from an unequivocal commitment; more so when it is at stake its ability to deal with a serious crisis. As stated by the *Continental* Tribunal, *\"it would be unconscionable for a country to promise not to change its legislation as time and needs change, or even more to tie its hands by such a kind of stipulation in case a crisis of any type or origin arose.33* That commitment would touch on core competencies of the State, which it is inconceivable the State would impliedly renounce. A treaty obligation, whereby the State guarantees the stability of its legal order renouncing the exercise of regulatory power must be explicit and cannot be assumed through an implicit declaration, diluted in general and ambiguous expressions about a treatment of investment standard (nor even by the way, through the preamble of a treaty).\n\n*S.D. Myers vs. Canada. First Partial Award.* Ad hoc\u2014UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, IIC 249 (2000). November 13, 2000; para. 263.\n\n*Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic,* cit.; para. 258.\n\n32.\n\nBITs do not contain any clause in which Argentina agrees to be bound not to exercise its regulatory power, when necessary, particularly if it arose a pressing social necessity to do so, which in fact did occur. There is no basis in the BITs to conclude that Argentina could only exercise its regulatory power in accordance with international law, if the requirements for a state of necessity were met. In this connection, I believe that the subsidiary defense advocated by Argentina based, on necessity, is inappropriate and unnecessary given that the BITs do not contain any explicit commitment to legal stability and a commitment of that nature cannot be inferred or presumed to be implied in any international convention. As already pointed out, such a commitment must be express or, at least, unambiguous. That is not the case in the BITs under review in the cases to which the Decision relates to.\n\n33.\n\nIt is true that the Decision does not state that the requirement of stability of the legal environment of the concession was absolute. Citing paragraph 306 of *Saluka,* it states that the legitimate regulatory interests of the host State must be borne in mind. I consider that paragraph 307 of the *Saluka* award helps to clarify the concept expressed, for in that case it is said that one should expect that the host State will\n\n*[implement] its policies bona fide by conduct that is, as far as it affects the investors\u2019 investment, reasonably justifiable by public policies and that such conduct does not manifestly violate the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and nondiscrimination. In particular, any differential treatment of a foreign investor must not be based on unreasonable distinctions and demands, and must be justified by showing that it bears a reasonable relationship to rational policies not motivated by a preference for other investment over the foreign-owned investment.34*\n\nFootnote omitted.\n\n34.\n\nThe paragraph quoted from *Saluka* is, in my opinion, beyond reproach. It shows that fair and equitable treatment is a standard of behavior, the emphasis of which is on the duties to the State rather than the rights of investors. Fair and equitable treatment, according to the above *dictum,* does not impose on the State an obligation not to alter the legal environment of the investment, but to require that the exercise of its regulatory power in matters connected with the foreign investment comply with the requirements in a way that is timely, consistent, reasonable, proportionate, even-handed, and non-discriminatory. In other words, what should be subject to scrutiny is whether these measures conform to the canons of good governance in a modem and well-organized State.\n\n35.\n\nArgentina, like any other State, had a duty to take exceptional measures, without excluding the modification of the legal regime of the Concession, to address a situation that was also exceptional. These measures were unforeseeable and unpredictable when the BITs were adopted, as was the severity of the emergency which Argentina underwent in 2001-2003. The BITs, as well as general international law provided no basis for concluding that in such a crisis situation taking unpredictable action or measures affecting the predictability of a regulatory framework would constitute a violation of an international obligation subject to reparation under international law.\n\n36.\n\nThe experience of the recent international financial crisis shows how States are compelled to adopt emergency measures that never entered the minds of leaders who had instead fought their entire lifetime against State intervention in certain areas of the economy. But that unpredictability neither determines the illegitimacy of such measures, nor can it be a legal basis for those who may be adversely affected by them to invoke acquired rights or to claim compensation. What might take away their legitimacy is if they were unreasonable, disproportionate, discriminatory, or in any way arbitrary. Again, what should be verified is whether the government\u2019s measures conform to the canons of a modem and well-organized State.\n\n37.\n\nIn this context, what the Tribunal should determine was whether the various measures taken by Argentina were such that any reasonably good government of a well-organized modem State could have adopted if it had to deal with a crisis of the proportions faced by Argentina, or whether, on the contrary, and to what extent, they were unreasonable, disproportionate, discriminatory, or in any way arbitrary. However, it is not for the Tribunal to determine the alternative measures that could have been adopted, because it cannot ex post facto substitute itself for the Argentine Government when it had to address the serious crisis that hit the country.\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal did not enter into the analysis of each of the Argentine measures in particular, but concluded that they breached the fair and equitable treatment, because they altered the Regulatory Framework on issues that fell under the legitimate expectations of investors.\n\n39.\n\nAccording to the Decision, the mere alteration of the Regulatory Framework violated the fair and equitable treatment, because Argentina could only exercise their legitimate right to regulate, within the rules of the detailed legal framework that Argentina had established for the Concession (para. 235). This assertion is not unreasonable, provided that is referred to situations of relative normalcy, but it is not wise when a serious situation arise requiring adaptation of the legal system to the new situation. In that context, what is reasonable is precisely the exercise of regulatory power in the most suitable for the common good.\n\n40.\n\nIn that sense, I find some contradiction in the Decision, because, while asserting that Argentina retained its legitimate regulatory power, also affirms that such power could not be exercised it in any way to change the regulatory framework, not even to address the requirements of the common good in an emergency situation in a way that was or could be timely, consistent, reasonable, proportionate, even-handed, and non-discriminatory. This would mean that the state cannot, by itself, exercise its regulatory power. Then, one could conclude, accordingly, that the regulatory power exists, but that does not exist at the same time.\n\n41.\n\nThe Tribunal did not enter into the analysis of each of the Argentine measures in particular, but concluded that they violated the fair and equitable treatment, because they altered the Regulatory Framework on issues which fell within the legitimate expectations of the investors. Nevertheless, the Decision refers to various measures enacted by Argentina, directing the regulatory authorities not to respect important elements of the legal framework, identifying those measures by the number of the Exhibits (Para. 240). Such actions, according to the Decision, were beyond the scope of its legitimate right to regulate and in effect constituted an abuse of regulatory discretion. These measures are:\n\n\u2022 C-85: Emergency Law;\n\n\u2022 C-90: Decree No. 293/02, of 12 February 2002 (C-90. R-ll), under which the Ministry of Economy is required to renegotiate public utilities contracts, with a period of 120 days set for that process;\n\n\u2022 C-91: Letter from ETOSS to AASA No. 14,505, of February 14, 2002, notifying AASA that, under the Emergency Law the regime of tariffs revisions based on modification of the exchange rate parity had been modified and that tariffs were temporary frozen until the issue of the regulations to the Emergency Law and relevant agreements will be achieved within the renegotiation of the Contract;\n\n\u2022 C-97: Resolution MoE 38/2002 of April 10, directing the regulatory and control agencies to *\"refrain from adopting any decision or taking any action that directly or indirectly affects public utility prices or tariffs...\"* pending the renegotiation of the Contracts of public services;\n\n\u2022 C-101: Decree 1090/02 of June 26, 2002 (C-101) of the President of Argentina, which provided that any claim for breach of the contracts subject to renegotiation must be included in the renegotiation process and form part of the agreements; and that any concessionaire that makes a claim outside of this framework shall remain outside the renegotiation process (Art. i);\n\n\u2022 C-108: Resolution 308/02 of August 20, 2002, which established special methods for sanctioning concessionaries for breaches which could be attributed to the emergency situation, including the suspension of sanctions for breaches arising from the emergency.. It also provided that those concessionaries who, in contravention of Decree 1090/02, *\"make a presentation at a judicial or arbitral venue on the alleged breach of contract based on guidelines laid down for cases of emergency shall be notified [...] to desist from such action, with an official warning that if they do not comply, action will be taken to have them excluded from said process. \"* This means that despite the subsistence of the threat of exclusion from the renegotiation process of those concessionaires who took their claims to arbitration, exclusion would not be automatic.\n\n42.\n\nSome of these measures point to the temporary freezing of tariffs, while others refer to the renegotiation of the contract (to which I refer below). It cannot be argued that the measures referred to the temporary freezing of tariffs, by themselves and at the time when they were adopted, were disproportionate, unreasonable, discriminatory or arbitrary, or that they were not within the range of decisions that any reasonable government could have adopted under the same circumstances.\n\n43.\n\nNevertheless, precisely for being exceptional, those measures should be implemented for the period strictly necessary to address the emergency. Temporality is an essential part of the reasonableness of this type of measure. Argentina did not comply with this requirement since some of the measures that severely affected AASA, particularly the freezing of tariffs, were extended indefinitely, which did not comply with the conduct that good governance would follow at all times. It is not reasonable to keep tariffs frozen for a public service provided by a party through the grant of an unsubsidized concession when there is evidence that its operating costs have risen significantly, for reasons unrelated to the concessionaire. The freezing could be explained for a short time\u2014while a reasonable degree of economic and social normalcy could be reestablished. Although efficiency was one of the components of the tariff system, there was evidence of enough causes external to the concession\u2014many of them having to do with the emergency measures adopted by the Government\u2014to offer solutions to the concessionaire that would be likely to restore the economic and financial balance of the concession, especially as it was under a legal duty to review the tariffs. By failing to take concrete actions that would make that result viable, Argentina departed from the canons of good governance in a modem State that is reasonably well-organized and, therefore, did not give the Claimants\u2019 investment the fair and equitable treatment imposed by the BITs.\n\n44.\n\nIn this regard, a breach of fair or equitable treatment does not arise, in my opinion, as an immediate consequence of the enactment of the Emergency Law or the other related measures adopted by the Government immediately after said Law, but from the moment when the minimum degree of normalcy required to also address the normalization of the Concession was reached.\n\n45.\n\nI also disagree with the Decision in the conclusion that the renegotiation decided upon unilaterally by the State constitutes another violation of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n46.\n\nThe renegotiation provided for under the Emergency Law was a general measure that affected all contracts for public works and services. As a matter of principle, it could not be regarded as unreasonable in the context of the abolition of the regime for convertibility of the peso against the dollar\u2014which had been an essential component of the privatization policy undertaken by Argentina in the nineties\u2014 of which the AASA Concession was a part.\n\n47.\n\nRenegotiation of long-term concession contracts is far from exceptional. Several witnesses for the Claimants admitted that it was normal to renegotiate the original terms of such contracts when faced with new and unforeseen events. On this basis, a first process for renegotiation of the AASA\u2019s Concession was set up in which many problems due to new and unforeseen events that had been facing the Concessionaire in the early years of performing the contract were solved. Moreover, regarding the renegotiation provided for under the Emergency Law, there are statements by representatives of the Claimants, in which there has not been alleged or demonstrated any coercion whatsoever, expressing their agreement with the renegotiation, always requiring, however, that the economic and financial equilibrium of the Concession be preserved. In fact, on August 10, 2002, AASA addressed the Government indicating that the solution to the financial breakdown that the Concession was suffering *\"cannot be exclusively a question of tariffs, but must respond in the context of complete restoration of equilibrium involving the different Concession stakeholders\"* (Note No. 41,704/02 of August 20, 2002, Annex R-124).\n\n48.\n\nI do not agree with the assumption expressed in the Decision (para. 239) that AASA was coerced into acceding to the renegotiation because, had it refused, it could have been accused of violating Article 5.1 of the Concession Agreement, which obligated both sides to *\"use all means available to establish and maintain a fluid relationship which would facilitate the discharge of this Concession Agreement* Rather, I believe that this clause is evidence that the obligation to renegotiate did not have as its sole source the Emergency Law, but the Concession Contract itself and that AASA could not lawfully refuse to renegotiate (as in fact it did not refuse). Moreover, the international standard for such contracts in the event of *\"hardship\"* aims to impose an obligation on the parties to negotiate an adaptation of the contract to the changed circumstances or the termination of the contract,35 which is moreover, in my opinion, a corollary of the good faith that should prevail in the execution of any contract.\n\n*Cf. Principles of European Contract Law* (developed by the Commission on European Contracts Law), ***Article 6:111: Change of Circumstances;***  *UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts 2004:*  ***Article 6.2.2 (Definition of hardship); Article 6.2.3 (Effects of hardship).***\n\n49.\n\nWhile in the renegotiation process there were episodes that were certainly reprehensible, I do not believe that they affected the essence of the process,36 On the contrary, a comprehensive analysis thereof reveals that the parties negotiated in the terms prescribed by international law,37 so that by the time that AASA and the Claimants ended the negotiations only disagreements on four issues separated them, as stated in a letter issued by the Claimants.38 One might speculate on what might have happened had Argentina settled these issues or had AASA and the Claimants not lost patience or hopes of reaching a settlement, but lapses in the conduct of either cannot be regarded as evidence of bad faith or a breach of the standards that should guide a negotiation. Despite having negotiated properly, the parties did not reach an agreement. This outcome, by itself, cannot be seen as a breach of the legal duty of any Party.\n\nThe unacceptable determination of the Government that would exclude from the renegotiation process concessionaires or investors wishing to exercise their right to have recourse to arbitration should be noted. However, the serious nature of this fact lowered its tone and pitch because it was a threat that was never fulfilled. In this case, the Claimants, as was their right, had recourse to this arbitration and were not for that reason excluded from the renegotiation.\n\nI refer to the standard defined by the International Court of Justice, in the sense that the parties *\"are under an obligation so to conduct themselves that the negotiations are meaningful, which will not be the case when either of them insists under upon its own position without contemplating any modification on it. \"* [Les parties *\"ont l'obligation de se comporter de telle mani\u00e8re que la n\u00e9gociation] ait un sens, ce qui n'est pas le cas lorsque l'une d'elles insiste sur sa propre position sans envisager aucune modification.\u2019\u2019]* Northern Sea Continental Shelf. Judgment. ICJ. Reports 1969, para. 85.\n\n*Cf* personal letter sent by Mr. Jean Louis Chaussade (Suez) to the Planning Minister Julio de Vido, September 7, 2005 (Annex C-367).\n\n50.\n\nWhat, to my way of thinking, has no satisfactory explanation is that while that prolonged negotiation process was being extended tariffs were kept frozen without arbitrating even a temporary remedy for the well-known financial difficulties that AASA was undergoing, as was requested by the latter repeatedly and insistently. That fact constitutes, without doubt, a violation of the obligation of fair and equitable treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investment. But that offense is not due to the renegotiation itself, but to Argentina\u2019s refusal to revise the tariffs, in contravention of its obligations under the BITs. From the foregoing, 1 conclude that the renegotiation process was not *per se* a violation of the State\u2019s obligations under the standard of fair and equitable treatment."}], "Content": "Decision on Liability\n---------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  | **Table of Abbreviations** |\n| AASA | Aguas Argentinas S.A. |\n| AGBAR | Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. |\n| AWG | AWG Group Ltd. |\n| AySA | Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos S.A. |\n| BIT | Bilateral Investment Treaty |\n| ETOSS | Ente Tripartito de Obras y Servicios Sanitarios |\n| ICSID | International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes |\n| OSN | Obras Sanitarias de la Naci\u00f3n |\n| PMES | Plan de Mejoras y Expansi\u00f3n del Servicio (Service Improvement and Expansion Plan) |\n| UNCITRAL | United Nations Commission on International Trade Law |\n| UNIREN | Renegotiation and Public Services Analysis Unit |\n| VCLT | Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties |\n\n**I. Procedural Background**\n----------------------------\n\nA. *Commencement of the Arbitration*\n------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 17 April 2003, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received a Request for Arbitration (\"the Request\") against the Argentine Republic (\"the Respondent\" or \"Argentina\") from Aguas Argentinas S.A. (\"AASA\"), Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. (\"AGBAR\"), Vivendi Universal S.A. (\"Vivendi\"), and AWG Group Ltd (\"AWG\"), (together, \"the Claimants\"). AASA was a company incorporated in Argentina. Suez and Vivendi, both incorporated in France, AGBAR, incorporated in Spain, and AWG, incorporated in the United Kingdom, were shareholders in AASA. The Request concerned the Claimants\u2019 investments in a concession for water distribution and waste water treatment services in the city of Buenos Aires and some surrounding municipalities and a series of alleged acts and omissions by Argentina, including Argentina\u2019s alleged failure or refusal to apply previously agreed adjustments to the tariff calculation and adjustment mechanisms.1\n\nOn the same date, the Centre received two further requests for arbitration under the ICSID Convention regarding water concessions in Argentina from (i) Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez, and Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. and (ii) Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe, Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona, S.A. and Interagua Servicios Integrales del Agua, S.A. regarding similar investments and disputes. As explained below, these requests would later be registered by the Centre and submitted by agreement of the parties to one same Tribunal. The first of the above-mentioned proceedings, involving Aguas Cordobesas S. A., would eventually be discontinued following an agreement between the parties.\n\n2.\n\nIn the Request, Claimants Suez and Vivendi invoked Argentina\u2019s consent to dispute settlement through ICSID arbitration provided in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and France (the \"Argentina-France BIT\")2 and AGBAR relied on Argentina\u2019s consent in the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"Argentina-Spain BIT\").3 Claimant AWG invoked Argentina\u2019s consent to arbitrate investment disputes under the 1990 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the \"Argentina-U.K. BIT\")4, which provides in Article 8 (3) that in the event an investment dispute is subject to international arbitration, Argentina and the investor concerned may agree to refer their dispute either to ICSID arbitration or to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (\"UNCITRAL Rules\") and that failing such agreement after a period of three months the parties are bound to submit their dispute to arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules. Although the required three months had elapsed without agreement, AWG in its Request for Arbitration invited Argentina to agree to extend ICSID arbitration to AWG\u2019s claims under the Argentina-U.K. BIT.\n\nAccord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Argentine sur l\u2019encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements (Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of France for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments), signed on 3 July 1991 and in force since 3 March 1993; 1728 UNTS 298.\n\nAcuerdo para la promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n rec\u00edprocas de inversiones entre el Reino de Espa\u00f1a y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic), signed in Buenos Aires on 3 October 1991 and in force since 28 September 1992; 1699 UNTS 202.\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, signed on 11 December 1990, and in force since 19 February 1993.\n\n3.\n\nOn 17 April 2003, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (\"Institution Rules\"), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the Request to the Argentine Republic and to the Argentine Embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n4.\n\nOn 17 July 2003, the Acting Secretary-General of the Centre registered the Request, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States (the \"ICSID Convention\" or \"the Convention\"). The case was registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 with the formal name of *Aguas Argentinas, S.A., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic.5* On that same date, the Acting Secretary-General, in accordance with Institution Rule 7, notified the parties of the registration of the Request and invited them to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible. Argentina did not agree to extend ICSID jurisdiction to the claims of AWG but it did agree to allow the case, although subject to UNCITRAL rules, to be administered by ICSID.\n\nAs noted in footnote 1 *supra,* on this same date the Centre registered two further requests for arbitration regarding water concessions in Argentina: ICSID Case No. ARB/03/18 *(Aguas Cordobesas S.A., Suez, and AGBAR v. Argentine Republic)* and ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17 *(Aguas Provinciales de Santa Fe, S.A., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and Interagua Servicios Integrales del Agua,S.A v. Argentine Republic).*\n\nB. *Constitution of the Tribunal*\n---------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe parties could not reach an agreement on the number of arbitrators to comprise the arbitral tribunal nor on the method for their appointment. Accordingly, on 22 September 2003, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention: *i.e.* one arbitrator appointed by each party, and the third arbitrator, who would serve as president of the tribunal, to be appointed by agreement of the parties. The Claimants appointed Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a Swiss national, as arbitrator. The Argentine Republic in turn appointed as arbitrator Professor Pedro Nikken, a national of Venezuela.\n\n6.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the parties on the name of the presiding arbitrator, on 21 October 2003, the Claimants, invoking Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 4 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"Arbitration Rules\"), requested the Centre to make this appointment. With the agreement of both parties, the Centre appointed Professor Jeswald W. Salacuse, a national of the United States of America, as the President of the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nOn 17 February 2004, the Deputy Secretary-General of ICSID, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date. On the same date, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal. The parties agreed that the same tribunal would hear and decide ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and the UNCITRAL arbitration initiated by AWG, along with two other cases involving water concessions in the provinces of Santa Fe (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17) and Cordoba (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/18).\n\nC. *Preliminary Session and Scheduling*\n---------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nUnder ICSID Arbitration Rule 13, the Tribunal shall hold its first session within 60 days after its constitution or such other period as the parties may agree. The parties could not agree on a suitable date for the first session within the prescribed time limits. The Tribunal accordingly held its first session without the parties via telephone conference on 19 April 2004.\n\n9.\n\nOn 7 June 2004, the Tribunal held a session with the parties at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. During the session the parties in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 confirmed their agreement that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the relevant provisions of the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules and that they did not have any objections in this respect. Similarly, in the case governed by the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, AWG and Argentina also agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted.\n\n10.\n\nDuring the session the parties also agreed on a number of procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal.6 The Tribunal, after consultation with the parties, also fixed a timetable for the written and oral pleadings in these cases.\n\nDuring the session the parties agreed on a series of procedural matters related to the present cases and ICSID Cases Nos. ARB/03/17 and ARB/03/18. These agreements included a staggered schedule of written and oral submissions. A copy of the minutes of the session was enclosed as Annex No.l to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction.\n\nD. *Respondent\u2019s Challenge to Jurisdiction*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn accordance with the agreed timetable, on 1 January 2005, the Claimants filed a joint Memorial on the Merits with accompanying documentation with respect to ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 and the arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules relating to the AWG claims. In response to the Claimants\u2019 Memorial, Argentina submitted a Memorial with objections to jurisdiction on 28 February 2005, alleging six specific grounds as to why ICSID and the present Tribunal were without jurisdiction to hear and decide Claimants\u2019 claim for damages. Certain of these objections applied only to Claimants\u2019 Suez, Vivendi, and AGBAR, which asserted ICSID jurisdiction, while others were applicable to all the Claimants.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 17 March 2005 the Tribunal confirmed the suspension of the proceedings on the merits in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3) and Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. On 6 April 2005, the Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\nE. *Petition for Transparency and Participation as Amicus Curiae*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nIn the meanwhile, on 28 January 2005, five non-governmental organizations (NGOs), Asociaci\u00f3n Civil por la Igualdad y la Justicia, Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales, Center for International Environmental Law, Consumidores Libres Cooperativa Ltda. de Provisi\u00f3n de Servicios de Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria, and Uni\u00f3n de Usuarios y Consumidores, filed a \"Petition for Transparency and Participation as Amicus Curiae\" (the \"Petition\") with the Secretary of the Tribunal. Following the filing of the Petition, the Tribunal invited the parties to make any observations they might have in this regard, and both parties submitted their views on this matter. On 19 May 2005, the Tribunal issued an *Order in Response to a Petition for Participation as Amicus Curiae,* setting out the conditions under which the Tribunal would consider amicus curiae submissions.7\n\nA similar request was subsequently filed with the same tribunal by a non-governmental organization and three named individuals in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17. The Tribunal\u2019s *Order in Response to a Petition for Participation as Amicus Curiae* of 17 March 2006 in that case is available at ICSID\u2019s website icsid.worldbank.org.\n\nF. *Withdrawal of AASA as a Claimant*\n-------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nAs agreed upon during the June 7, 2004 session, a hearing on jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on 11 May 2005. Following the hearing, as the Tribunal was in the process of deliberating on jurisdiction, counsel for the Claimants, by letter of 9 February 2006, informed the Tribunal that the Claimant shareholders of AASA were in the process of selling their interests in AASA to third parties and that \"... in order to facilitate the required approval by the Republic of Argentina of such sale, AASA has decided to withdraw its claim in the above-referenced arbitration\" but that such withdrawal was expressly without prejudice to the Claimant Shareholders\u2019 claims in this proceeding. Upon invitation of the Tribunal, the Respondent filed its observations to this withdrawal by letter of 15 February 2006. The Respondent did not object to the withdrawal of AASA but requested that the Claimant AASA provide the Respondent copies of the minutes of the shareholders\u2019 meeting *(Asamblea de Accionistas de AASA)* with respect to the decision authorizing such withdrawal. At the same time, the Respondent advanced further arguments objecting to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction and asserting that AASA\u2019s decision to withdraw extinguished the claims of the other claimants in this case. At the invitation of the Tribunal, counsel for AASA provided copies of the minutes of the AASA\u2019s shareholders\u2019 meeting of 8 February 2006, authorizing the discontinuance of its claim before this Tribunal. At the same time, counsel for the Claimants rejected each of the Respondent\u2019s arguments challenging the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to the other Claimants. The Tribunal provided copies of these documents to the Respondent and requested its observation concerning AASA\u2019s withdrawal. By letter of 31 March 2006, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that \"...the Argentine Republic does not oppose the proposed cessation by the Concessionaire... AASA...\" in ICSID Arbitration ARB/03/19 (\"... *la Rep\u00fablica Argentina* *no se opone al desistimiento planteado por la[s] Concesionaria[s] AASA...\"),* but argued that such withdrawal had legal consequences with respect to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the shareholder Claimants and their claims.\n\n15.\n\nIn its deliberations on this request, the Tribunal found that neither the ICSID Convention nor the Rules specifically provided for the withdrawal of one party from an arbitration proceeding which is to continue thereafter. ICSID Arbitration Rule 44, the provision of closest relevance to the action requested by the Claimant AASA, allows the discontinuation of an arbitration proceeding at the request of a party when the other party does not object. But Arbitration Rule 44 by a strict reading of its terms does not apply to the withdrawal of a single party. Nonetheless, the Tribunal, relying on Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which grants ICSID tribunals the power to decide procedural questions not covered by the Convention or the Rules, concluded that it had the power to order the discontinuance of proceedings with respect to one party at its request when the other party did not object. The Tribunal found that permitting such discontinuance in this case was in accordance with the basic objective of the ICSID Convention of facilitating the settlement of investment disputes, of which ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 is a specific manifestation. It also was of the view that the continued participation of AASA in this proceeding would serve no useful purpose in bringing about a fair and correct resolution of the present arbitration.\n\n16.\n\nOn 14 April 2006, the Tribunal therefore entered Procedural Order No. 1 *Concerning the Discontinuance of Proceedings with Respect to Aguas Argentinas S.A.,* directing that: (i) the proceedings in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 with respect to the Claimant Aguas Argentinas S.A. be discontinued and that the said Claimant Aguas Argentinas S.A. cease to be a party with effect from 14 April 2006; and (ii) that the proceedings in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 continue in all other respects. With respect to the Respondent\u2019s arguments that the withdrawal of AASA from the case had implications for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over the shareholder Claimants and their claims, the Tribunal concluded that these objections were more appropriately addressed in its decision on jurisdiction.\n\nG. *The Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nAfter having considered each and every jurisdictional objection raised by the Respondent, the Tribunal rejected them all, except for the fourth objection based on the status of AASA as an Argentine corporation, which objection had become moot because of the discontinuance of the proceedings in the case with respect to AASA. In its Decision on Jurisdiction of 3 August 2006,8 the Tribunal thus decided that ICSID and this Tribunal had jurisdiction over ICSID case No. ARB/03/19 and that this Tribunal also had jurisdiction over the UNCITRAL arbitration between AWG and the Argentine Republic. The Tribunal therefore directed that the former case proceed on the merits in accordance with the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Rules, and the applicable bilateral investment treaties and that the latter case proceed on the merits in accordance with the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and the applicable bilateral investment treaty. The Tribunal accordingly made the necessary Orders for the continuation of the proceeding pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(4) and Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Subsequently, with the consultation of the parties, the Tribunal scheduled dates for a hearing on the merits.\n\nAvailable at icsid.worldbank.org.\n\nH. *Amicus Curiae Submission*\n-----------------------------\n\n18.\n\nOn 1 December 2006, the five non-governmental organization that had previously requested to submit *amicus curiae* submissions in this case formally filed a *\"Solicitud de autorizaci\u00f3n para realizar una presentaci\u00f3n en calidad de Amicus Curiae\"* (Petition for Permission to Make an *Amicus Curiae* Submission) in accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s Order of 19 May 2005, referred to above in paragraph 13. After receiving the observations of the parties on this Petition, the Tribunal in an *Order in Response to a Petition By Five Non-Governmental Organizations For Permission to Make an Amicus Curiae Submission,* of 12 February 2007,9 permitted them to file a single joint submission under specified conditions not later than 14 April 2007. The five non-governmental organizations did in fact submit a joint *amicus curiae* submission, which was subsequently transmitted to the parties for their observations.\n\nAvailable at icsid.worldbank.org.\n\nI. *Respondent\u2019s First Arbitrator Challenge*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nOn 12 October 2007, shortly before the hearing on the merits was to take place, the Respondent filed a Proposal pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to disqualify Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler as a member of the Tribunal \"... by virtue of the objective existence of justified doubts with respect to her impartiality.\" (para. 1) (\"... *en virtud de la existencia objetiva de dudas justificadas respecto de su imparcialidad\u2019).* The alleged basis for this request arose out of the fact that Professor Kaufman-Kohler had been a member of an ICSID tribunal in the case of *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del* *Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,*10 which had rendered an award against Argentina on 20 August 2007.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3); hereinafter \"Vivendi II.\"\n\n20.\n\nOnce the Tribunal became aware of the Respondent\u2019s Proposal, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler immediately withdrew from Tribunal deliberations, and the two remaining Tribunal members suspended proceedings in the three cases pending before it on 15 October 2007, forwarded the Respondent\u2019s Proposal to the Claimants with a request for their observations, and invited Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to furnish any explanations that she wished to make. After receiving submissions from the parties and from Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, the two remaining members of the Tribunal deliberated and, on 22 October 2007, made a *Decision on the Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Tribunal*,11 rejecting the Respondent\u2019s Proposal, directing that the state of suspension of the proceedings be terminated, and affirming the schedule of hearings fixed by agreement of the parties.\n\nAvailable at icsid.worldbank.org\n\nJ. *Hearing on the Merits*\n--------------------------\n\n21.\n\nA hearing on the merits in these cases took place from 28 October 2007 through 8 November 2007 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. Each side in the case presented a number of witnesses for examination by the other side and questions from the Tribunal. Messrs. Nigel Blackaby and Lluis Paradell, Ms. Noiana Marigo, Ms. Maria Julia Milesi, Ms. Patricia Garcia, Ms. Andrea Camargo Garcia and Ms. Daisy Joye, from the law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP; Mr. Bernardo Iriberri, from Estudio Cardenas, Di Ci\u00f3, Romero, Tarsitano & Lucero, Abogados in Buenos Aires; Mr. Julio Durand from Estudio Cassagne, Abogados in Buenos Aires; Mr. Jean-Marie Guvain, Ms. Isabelle Froment-Meurice and Mr. Antoine Tchekhoff from Suez Environment; Mr. Miquel Gri\u00f1o, from AGBAR; Mr. Enrique Amsten, from Anglian Water Limited (AWG) and Messrs. Fran\u00e7ois Moncomble and Charles-Louis De Maud\u2019huy, from Vivendi Universal S.A., attended the hearing on behalf of the Claimants. Messrs. Adolfo Gustavo Scrinzi, Gabriel Bottini, Jorge Barraguirre, Fabi\u00e1n Rosales Markaida, Mauricio D\u2019alessandro Longhin, Alejandro Turyn, Facundo Perez Aznar, Diego Gosis Nicolas Grosse, Javier Pargament, Florencio Travieso, Nicolas Diana, Nicolas Duhalde, Julian Negro and Carlos Winograd, and Ms. Adriana Busto and Ms. Alejandra Mackluf, from the *Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina,* Mr. Bernard Mettetal, from HMN & Partners, and Mr. Ignacio Torterola, from the Embassy of the Argentine Republic in Washington D.C., attended the hearing on behalf of the Respondent. The Tribunal posed questions to the parties, as provided in Rule 32(3) of the Arbitration Rules. At the end of the hearing, the Tribunal directed the parties to simultaneously file post-hearing briefs by a specified date in early January 2008.\n\nK. *Respondent\u2019s Second Arbitrator Challenge*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nOn 29 November 2007, before the time for the filing of the parties\u2019 post-hearing submissions had passed, the Respondent filed with the Tribunal a second proposal to disqualify Professor Kaufmann-Kohler (hereinafter \"Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal\") pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention and Rule 9 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules \"... on the basis that Mrs. Kaufmann-Kohler does not meet the conditions required to be an arbitrator in the above mentioned proceedings, pursuant to the provisions set forth in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.\" Specifically, the Respondent alleged that \"... Mrs. Kaufmann-Kohler cannot be \u2018relied upon to exercise independent judgment,\u2019... since [she] holds the position of Director of the UBS group...\", which held shares in Suez and Vivendi and engaged in certain other activities relating to the international water sector. Moreover, the Respondent asserted that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler failed to disclose this fact to the parties and to ICSID as is required by the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal also extended to two other ICSID cases, not subject to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, in which Professor Kaufmann-Kohler is also serving as an arbitrator.12\n\n*Electricidad Argentina S.A. and EDF International S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/22) and *EDF International S.A., SAUR International S.A. and Le\u00f3n Participaciones Argentinas S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/23).\n\n23.\n\nOn receipt by the Tribunal of the Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler withdrew from Tribunal deliberations. The two remaining members suspended the proceedings (including the date for the filing of post-hearing submissions) on 4 December 2007, forwarded the Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal to the Claimants with a request for their observations, and invited Professor Kaufmann-Kohler to furnish any explanations that she wished to make. By letter of 4 December 2007 to the parties, the two remaining members of the Tribunal expressed their understanding that in keeping with the parties\u2019 agreement that a single tribunal was to hear the above-captioned cases the parties were bestowing on the remaining members the authority to decide the challenge under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules in the case of *AWG Group Limited v. the Argentine Republic.* Neither party expressed any objection to the Tribunal proceeding on this basis.\n\n24.\n\nUpon receiving an explanation from Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and an exchange of observations on the matter from the parties, the remaining members of the Tribunal in a Decision dated 12 May 200813 determined that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s position as a non-executive director of UBS, one of the world\u2019s largest asset managers, did not affect her independence as an arbitrator in the above-entitled cases since she was unaware or UBS\u2019s specific, relatively small holdings in any claimant and moreover was not in any way involved with UBS activities in the water sector. It also concluded that she therefore had no obligation to disclose her UBS directorship to the parties or to the Tribunal. The Tribunal further directed the parties to submit their post-hearing submissions by 18 June 2008, which they did.\n\nDecision on a Second Proposal for the Disqualification of a Member of the Arbitral Tribunal of 12 May 2008.\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal has now considered and deliberated upon the parties\u2019 various written submissions and the oral arguments presented during the course of the hearing on the merits. Since the parties pleaded ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 jointly with the UNCITRAL case *of AWG Group Limited v. the Argentine Republic* and filed joint memorials relating thereto, and since the facts and legal questions in both cases are virtually identical, the Tribunal has determined that it is appropriate to issue a single statement of its conclusions, as it did in deciding on jurisdiction.\n\n**II. The Facts of this Dispute**\n---------------------------------\n\nA. *Background*\n---------------\n\n26.\n\nThis investment dispute arises out of one of the world\u2019s largest water distribution and waste water treatment privatizations in a great city, the city of Buenos Aires. To accomplish the privatization, the Argentine Republic granted a concession to an entity, Aguas Argentinas S.A., organized and managed by the Claimants, all of which had significant interests and experience in the water business. The Respondent is a federal republic consisting of the autonomous city of Buenos Aires and twenty-three provinces.\n\n27.\n\nPrior to the granting of the concession in this case, the provision of water and sewage services in Argentina had been the responsibility of State-owned and managed entities. From 1912 until 1980, *Obras Sanitarias de la Nacion* (OSN), a corporation owned by the federal government, provided water and sewage services throughout most of the territory of Argentina. In 1980, the government of Argentina decentralized water and sewage services, transferring this function to provincial authorities, with the exception of the City of Buenos Aires and certain surrounding municipalities, which remained the responsibility of OSN.\n\n28.\n\nDuring the 1980s, the Argentine economy and particularly the country\u2019s public enterprises suffered severe problems. The country experienced extremely high inflation, steep budgetary and fiscal deficits, a serious lack of investment capital, and no less than four currency crises, each resulting in a currency devaluation of over 90%. Its public enterprises, such as OSN, also ran large deficits, suffered from under-investment in their plants and services, and in general were not managed efficiently. With respect to OSN, the result of this situation was deterioration in the quality and quantity of water and sewage services provided to the public and the inability to expand the service to all inhabitants of the area, a situation that raised concern in the public and the press with respect to the health and safety of the population\n\nB. *The Privatization of the Buenos Aires Water and Sewage Systems*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nTo address the situation at a general level, in 1989 Argentina enacted the State Reform Law,14 which declared the country\u2019s public services to be in a state of emergency and proposed to launch a broad program of privatization to remedy the situation, by which the Argentine government would transfer the assets, operations, and functions of various designated State-owned companies and entities to private and primarily foreign investors in accordance with certain specified legal arrangements. The State Reform Law also invited the country\u2019s provinces to participate in the privatization process. Subsequently, Argentina took certain other measures attractive to private and foreign investment to its territory. Less than two years after the State Reform Law, Argentina adopted the Convertibility Law by which it tied or \"pegged\" the value of the Argentine Peso to the United States Dollar and established a currency board requiring that the amount of Argentine currency in circulation be equivalent to the foreign currency reserves held by the State.15 Starting in 1990, it also began to conclude bilateral treaties \"for the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments\" with various countries. By the year 2000, it had concluded 57 such bilateral investment treaties, commonly known as BITs, including the December 1990 Argentina-U.K BIT, the July 1991 Argentina-France BIT, and the October 1991 Argentina-Spain BIT, under which the Claimants assert various rights in these cases.\n\nLaw No. 23,696 of 23 August 1989 (the State Reform Law) (Exh. C-5).\n\nLaw No. 23,928 of 28 March 1991(Exh. C-12).\n\n30.\n\nAs part of its reform and privatization program, Argentina enacted Decree No. 2074/90 of October 5, 1990 to establish a regulatory framework by which various designated public services, including OSN, would be privatized and transferred to private and foreign investors through a bidding process whereby they would be granted long-term concession agreements that would require the infusion by investors of new capital and technology.16 The federal government actively publicized its desire to privatize these services and made significant efforts, including a road show in Brussels, to interest particularly qualified foreign enterprises to invest in the privatized entities, preparing and distributing a prospectus toward this end.17 On 30 June 1992, the Argentine government issued Decree 999/92, known as the \"Water Decree\" to establish a regulatory framework for the privatization of OSN and to provide for the rights and obligations of the future concessionaire, the related regulatory bodies, and the users of the service.18 To attract the most qualified and experienced investors and to secure investment on the most favorable terms, the government established a rigorous international bidding process that included a pre-qualification procedure which would allow only the most financially and technically qualified enterprises to engage in actually bidding to take over the privatized public service.\n\nDecree No. 2074/90, of 5 October 1990 (Exh. C-7).\n\nSee, *e.g.,* The \"Information Memorandum\" issued by OSN, dated November 1991 (Exh.C-19).\n\nDecree No. 999/92, of 30 June 1992 (the \"Water Decree\") (Exh. C-33).\n\n31.\n\nBased on the principles set down in the Water Decree, the Federal Ministry of Public Works and Services promulgated detailed Original Bidding Rules *(Pliego de Bases y Condiciones)* that stated the object, term, and rules of the Concession, defined the bidding procedure, specified the rules concerning the concession contract, and also set out a model of the future Concession contract. These rules, as subsequently revised, and the related model contract specified certain important provisions governing the financial aspects of the proposed concession, including investment commitments, tariffs, and standards of efficiency to be achieved by the concessionaire. Argentina was not seeking just any investor, but an investor who would provide comprehensive and efficient service at lowest cost to users. The cost to users was determined by the tariff charged by the concessionaire for the service provided. Throughout the process, various international institutions, particularly the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, strongly supported Argentina\u2019s privatization program with advice, financing, and encouragement.19 In addition, Argentina was assisted by two external consultants, William Halcrow & Partners Ltd., with respect to technical issues, and Banque Paribas, with respect to financial matters.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial, paras. 32-41.\n\nC. *The Selection of the Claimants\u2019 Consortium as Concessionaire*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nIn response to these measures, the Claimants Suez, AGBAR, Vivendi and AWG, together with Argentine companies Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires S.A., Sociedad Comercial del Plata S.A. (SCP), and Meller S.A., formed a consortium in 1992 to bid for the concession to operate specified water distribution and waste water systems in the city of Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities. The winning bidder was to be the bidder who promised the largest average tariff reduction after making specified investments and meeting certain quality and efficiency standards. The Revised Bidding rules established a reference tariff, known as the \"K\" factor. During the tender period, this reference tariff was revised upward on two occasions by the Argentine government to take account of inflation and taxes. Each bid was to include an Adjustment Coefficient which was intended to reduce the \"K\" factor or reference tariff. The \"K Factor Adjustment Coefficient,\" known as the CAFK, proposed by a bidder, which would lead to the lowest tariff, all other requirements being met, would be the winning bid. Such proposed adjusted tariff was to be applied throughout the life of the concession. The revenues from tariff payments by the users of the service were to be paid in Argentine currency and were to constitute the cash flow that over the years of the concession would cover the costs of operating and developing the service, as well as yield a return to investors. As will be seen below in the discussion of the legal framework of the concession, provision was also made in the regulations and concession contract for tariff revisions during the period of the concession.\n\n33.\n\nUltimately, the consortium organized by the Claimants was chosen as the winning bidder, primarily because it proposed to charge the lowest tariff among all the other bidders. On 28 December 1992, the Government of Argentina by Resolution No. 155/92 of the Secretariat of Public Works and Communications, later approved by Decree No. 787/93 of 20 September 1993, awarded the Claimants\u2019 consortium the Concession to operate the water distribution and waste water services system in the City of Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities. Pursuant to the legal and regulatory framework governing the privatization process, the consortium subsequently formed an Argentine company, Aguas Argentinas S.A. (AASA) with an initial capitalization of US$120 million to hold and operate the Concession. At the company\u2019s foundation, AASA\u2019s capital stock was owned in the following proportions: (i) Suez (25.3%); (ii) Vivendi (known at the time as Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux) (8%); (iii) AWG (4.5%); (iv) SCP (20.7%); (v) Meller S.A. (10.8%); (vi) AGBAR (12.6%); (vii) Banco de Galicia (8.1%); and the Employee Stock Ownership Program (10%). Individual shareholding would subsequently change with the addition of new shareholders and the departure from the company of others.\n\n34.\n\nOn 28 April 1993, AASA formally concluded a thirty-year Concession Contract with the Argentine Government,20 represented by the Minister of Economy and Public Works. On 1 May 1993 it assumed control and management of the designated water distribution and waste water systems. The Concession Contract, which will be discussed at length below in connection with the Concession\u2019s legal framework, specified the tariff regime to which AASA was entitled and mandated service quality standards and expansion and investment goals that the Concessionaire was required to meet. Pursuant to the Concession Contract, the Concessionaire did not own the assets of the water and sewage service it was to manage and develop, nor its investments in them, and it was required at the end of the Concession to return the service to the Argentine State in good operating condition. Neither AASA nor the Claimants were required to pay Argentina for obtaining the Concession; however, the Concession Contract required them to post a performance bond to protect Argentina against injury due to deficient operation of the water and waste water systems entrusted to them. Following the legal requirements, Claimant Suez was designated as the operator of the Concession and its rights and responsibilities in that capacity were defined in a Management Contract annexed to the Concession Contract.\n\nExh. C-44.\n\nD. *The First Eight Years of Operation (1993-2001)*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nDue to the poor state of the water and sewage system subject to the Concession, the Concessionaire was obligated under the Concession Contract to undertake major investments for expansion and improvement of the system. As is customary in long-term concessions implying substantial investments in early years, the Concession\u2019s investment requirements exceeded the amounts that might be gained immediately from tariff revenues; consequently, the Concessionaire sought loans from local and international sources, primarily from multilateral lending agencies whose loans were denominated and payable in U.S. dollars. It chose to rely on loans from multilateral agencies because long-term loans of the type needed to finance infrastructure investments were not available from Argentine financial institutions and because AASA considered the interest rate charged by the multilaterals agencies more favorable than that of other forms of available financing. The multilateral agencies required as a condition for lending that the shareholders in AASA promise to provide financial support to AASA in the event it was unable to make scheduled payments under the loans. In addition, the consortium members were required to secure a bank guarantee in favor of the Argentine government to guarantee their promised performance and investments under the consortium. According to the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on the Merits, by 2001 AASA had invested a total of US$ 1.7 billion in the concession, consisting of US$120 million in AASA\u2019s initial capital, US$706.1 million primarily from loans by multilateral lending institutions, and the remainder from cash flows generated by AASA.21\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, paras. 23-24.\n\n36.\n\nAs a result of these investments, substantial improvement and expansion of the water distribution and sewage systems appear to have taken place. Evidence offered by the Claimants and not challenged by the Respondent indicates that between 1993 when AASA assumed the Concession, and 2005 when the Concession was near its end the population with access to drinking water increased from 5,559,270 persons to 7,859,000 persons (an increase of 41.37%) and the population with access to sewage services increased from 4,532,856 persons to 5,989,000 persons (an increase of 32.12%). Moreover during that same period the production of drinking water increased from 3,398,000 cubic meters a day to 4,700,000 cubic meters a day (an increase of 33%), the sewage treatment capacity increased from 27,305,000 cubic meters a day to 80,334,603 cubic meters a day (an increase of 194.20%), and the water network expanded from 11,913 kilometers to 16,459 kilometers (an increase of 38.16 %). It would therefore seem that as a result of the Concession the Respondent achieved at least some of the goals that it had sought in undertaking the privatization of the water and waste water treatment systems of Buenos Aires. Although the Respondent made various allegations at the hearing on the merits concerning AASA\u2019s poor performance, particularly with regard to the level of nitrates in the water, it does not appear from the evidence that the Argentine authorities raised performance issues with AASA in any serious way during the period 1993 to 2001, the first eight years of the Concession.\n\n37.\n\nAs will be seen below, the legal framework governing the relationship between the parties to this case remained relatively stable from 1993 until approximately 2001. Indeed, relations between the Concessionaire and the Argentine State appeared to have been relatively harmonious and cooperative throughout those eight years. Moreover, the financial condition of AASA was sound, as evidenced by the fact that in January 1999 Standard & Poor\u2019s awarded it an investment grade rating of BBB-. Duffs and Phelps gave it a similar rating.\n\n38.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Concession was to extend over thirty-years until the year 2023, the legal framework and the Concession Contract provided defined procedures to make adjustments in tariffs, investment commitments, and other factors, according to specified conditions, in the face of changing and unexpected circumstances. During the period between 1994 and 2001, the Argentine authorities agreed to two such adjustments. The first took place in 1994 when the *Ente Tripartite) de Obras y Servicios Sanitarios* (ETOSS), the regulatory authority, and the municipality of Buenos Aires requested AASA to incur additional investments in order to expand the system beyond the requirement of its then current investment plan. By ETOSS Resolution 81/94 of 30 June 1994, with the approval of the relevant government authorities, an extraordinary tariff revision was effected under the regulations to allow for the requested increased investments.\n\n39.\n\nA second adjustment in the terms of the Concession came about as a result of a renegotiation that took place during the period 1997-1999. On 12 April 1996, AASA sent a note to ETOSS formally requesting a \"structured discussion\" of various issues concerning the Concession and asking for a tariff revision that could take account of Argentine realities and various difficulties that the Concession was experiencing. These difficulties included the country\u2019s higher than anticipated inflation rate, the refusal of some sectors of the community to pay the infrastructure charge for water and sewage connections, a tariff regime considered inadequate because of being subject to political pressures, and higher than expected per capita consumption of water, among others.22 The Argentine government formally authorized a renegotiation on various issues of concern including the \"economic and financial parameters of the concession,\" the incorporation of new areas into the Concession, investment deferral, and master plans for waste water and drinking water, among others.23 Over the next two years, representatives of AASA and the government negotiated and agreed upon numerous issues affecting the Concession. Periodically, matters agreed upon would be embodied in an *\"Acta Acuerdo\"* which would subsequently be formally approved by government decree. Thus for example, an **Acta Acuerdo** of 30 October 1997, subsequently, approved by Decree 1167/97 of 20 November 1997, approved a new investment plan, eliminated the infrastructure charge from the tariff, and agreed on exchange rate modifications to the tariff. And an **Acta Acuerdo** of 21 November 1998, approved by Resolution 1103/98 of 28 December 1998, requested AASA to prepare a \"Model Company,\" which if approved would be used to evaluate the efficiency of AASA operations. A government decree formally ended the renegotiation in November 1999.24\n\nNote No. 6682/96, of 12 April 1996 (Exh. C-52; or Exh. R-41).\n\nDecree No, 149/97, of 14 February 1997 (Exh. R-49).\n\nDecree 1369/99, of 29 November 1999 (Exh. C-65).\n\n40.\n\nThe significance of these revisions and renegotiations lies not in the details of what the parties discussed and agreed to but rather in what they suggest about the parties\u2019 relationship with and intentions toward each other. First, it seems clear that the parties considered that any difficulties encountered could be resolved through consultations and negotiations. The Concession Contract, as will be seen, required the Concessionaire and the government to \"... to establish and maintain a fluid relationship that facilitates the performance of this Concession Contract.\"25 It seems clear from the manner in which the parties resolved difficulties during the first eight years of the concession that such a desired fluid relationship did exist. On the other hand, during the course of this conflict and in retrospect, Argentina has suggested another interpretation for the revisions and renegotiations: that the Claimants made an unrealistically low bid in order to win the Concession and thereafter used the revision and renegotiation processes to secure tariff increases, which if they had been included in the original bid, would not have gained the Claimants the Concession in the first place. Other than supposition, Argentina offered no evidence to support this interpretation of the Claimants\u2019 actions. For example, it did not offer evidence as to how the Claimants\u2019 bid compared to those received from other bidders. It is also to be noted that Argentina had the assistance of international consultants in designing the bidding rules and evaluating the bids submitted.\n\nArticle 5.1 of the Concession Contract\n\nE. *The Argentine Financial Crisis (2001-2003)*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nBy the year 2000, the Argentine Republic began to experience significant economic difficulties that would eventually lead to a financial crisis having serious consequences for the country, its people, and its investors, both foreign and national. The early manifestation of this impending crisis was the increasing difficulty that Argentina was experiencing in paying its foreign debts. The government\u2019s early response to this situation was the institution of an austerity program that tightened fiscal policies, reduced public spending, and raised taxes. These measures did not reverse the deteriorating situation and indeed appear to have had a negative effect on AASA\u2019s tariff collections. In early 2001, AASA\u2019s financial situation worsened when its credit rating was downgraded by Standard & Poor\u2019s, resulting in a substantial increase in costs to access financing necessary to meet its investment obligations under the Concession.\n\n42.\n\nIn March 2001, as part of its efforts to deal with the crisis, the government imposed new taxes on bank accounts, with the effect of raising the Concession\u2019s costs of operation. In response, AASA wrote a letter of 29 March 2001 to the regulatory authority, ETOSS, requesting an extraordinary review of the applicable tariff pursuant to the provisions of the Concession Contract and regulatory framework. In the face of a deteriorating situation, during the succeeding months of 2001, it sent subsequent letters to ETOSS seeking a review of the applicable tariff because of its increased difficulty in meeting its commitments to its lenders for the financing of its investments. In October 2001, ETOSS responded by requesting more information but without acceding to the request for consideration of a tariff revision. In its Memorial, Respondent explains the ETOSS reaction by arguing that the risks associated with financing the Concession were to be borne by the Concessionaire, not the consumers or the Argentine State.26 Nonetheless, the Concessionaire persisted in its attempts to obtain a tariff revision.\n\nRespondents\u2019 Counter Memorial, para. 200.\n\n43.\n\nAs the crisis deepened at the end of 2001 and the beginning of 2002, the Argentine government adopted a series of measures of increasing severity. In December 2001, it enacted Decree No 1570/01 of 3 December 2001, which imposed a *\"corralito\"* or \"little fence\" on bank accounts, limiting the amounts of cash withdrawals by account holders.27 The resulting negative public reaction and disturbances prompted by this measure forced then President de la Rua to resign on 20 December. There followed in succession the appointment of four presidents during the following ten days until the election of President Eduardo Duhalde who would serve out the remainder of the presidential term until May 2003.\n\nExh. C-82.\n\nF. *Attempts to Renegotiate the Concession*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nUnder President Duhalde, Argentina enacted a series of emergency legislative measures that to a significant extent repealed or modified previously important provisions of Argentine law. One of the most important of these was the Emergency Law No. 25,561 of 6 January 200228 that: (i) abolished the currency board that had linked the Argentine Peso to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a significant depreciation of the Argentine Peso; (ii) abolished the adjustment of public service contracts according to agreed upon indexations; and (iii) authorized the Executive branch of government to renegotiate all public service contracts. Under Article 9 of the Law, the renegotiation of public service contracts was to take account of the following criteria: 1) the impact of tariffs on economic competiveness and income distribution; 2) the quality of service and investment plans; 3) the interests of the consumers and the accessibility of services; 4) the safety of the system; and 5) the profitability of the enterprises. Article 10 stated that in no case were the provisions of the Law to authorize a suspension or alteration of the contractual obligations incurred by the affected public services. Claiming that these measures injured their investments in violation of the commitments made to them in securing the Concession, the Claimants sought to obtain from the government adjustments in the tariffs that AASA could charge for water distribution and waste water services, as well as modifications of other operating conditions.\n\nLaw No. 25,561 *(Ley de Emergencia P\u00fablica y de Reforma del R\u00e9gimen Cambiario)* of 6 January 2002 (the \"Emergency Law\") (Exh. C-85).\n\n45.\n\nOn 10 January 2002, AASA sent a letter to the regulatory authorities, again requesting an extraordinary tariff review pursuant to the Concession\u2019s legal framework. On 30 January, it submitted an emergency plan for operating the Concession during the crisis.\n\n46.\n\nShortly after the enactment of the Emergency Law, President Duhalde issued a decree that created a Renegotiation Commission within the Ministry of Economy, and specifically transferred to the Ministry the task of renegotiating the AASA Concession Contract.29 On 14 February 2002, ETOSS rejected the proposed tariff adjustments requested by AASA. On 6 March, AASA sent a new request for a tariff revision to the undersecretary of water resources.\n\nDecree No. 293/02, of 14 Februaiy 2002 (Exh. C-90).\n\n47.\n\nIn April 2002, the Ministry of the Economy issued a resolution prohibiting all regulatory agencies, including ETOSS, from taking any measures that directly or indirectly affected the tariffs of any entities subject to their regulatory supervision until the end of the renegotiation period.30 On 16 May 2002, the Renegotiation Commission rejected an Emergency Plan requested by AASA.\n\nResolution No. 38/02, of 10 April 2002 (Exh. C-97).\n\n48.\n\nIn the meanwhile, AASA\u2019s financial situation became increasingly difficult so that in July it decided to pay its creditors only part of the accrued interest it owed on a *pari passu* basis. On 4 December 2002, AASA submitted a new proposal requesting that the tariff regime be modified to allow the attainment of the originally contemplated balance or equilibrium of revenues and expenditures. On 26 February 2003, ETOSS issued its final report on AASA, which failed to take account of AASA\u2019s proposal of the previous December, of which AASA complained in a subsequent letter of 10 April. On 17 April 2003, AASA and the Claimant shareholders filed requests for arbitration with ICSID.\n\n49.\n\nDuring this time, through its representatives, AASA continued to participate in the renegotiation process established by President Duhalde and to attend numerous meetings relating thereto, which was to continue without result until the election of President N\u00e9stor Kirchner, who would take office on 25 May 2003. Shortly thereafter, President Kirchner issued a decree redefining the renegotiation process and creating a new administrative unit, the Renegotiation and Public Services Contract Analysis Unit *(Unidad de Renegociaci\u00f3n y An\u00e1lisis de Contratos de Servicios P\u00fablicos - UNIREN)* of the Ministry of Economy and the new Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investments and Utilities, to reinitiate the renegotiation process.31 A subsequent law in October of 2003 extended the renegotiation period and set down additional rules to guide the process, including the principle in Article 2 that \"the decisions made by the Executive Branch in the course of renegotiation shall not be limited or conditioned by the regulatory frameworks that govern the concession or license agreements for the relevant public services.\"32 AASA continued to operate the water and sewage concession in question and to participate in the renegotiation process created by the government. Despite various proposals advanced by both parties, the renegotiation process proved fruitless. At the same time, in July 2003, AASA was required by the government to provide water and sewage services to areas that were not originally within its Concession.\n\nDecree No. 311/03, of 4 July 2003 (Exh. C-127).\n\nLaw No. 25,790 of 22 October 2003 (Exh. C-134).\n\n50.\n\nNegotiations between AASA and the government on the future of the Concession continued with varying degrees of intensity over a period of four years but the parties were unable to resolve their differences, despite occasional hopeful signs from time to time. The effective devaluation of the Argentine peso meant that AASA\u2019s costs increased substantially and the government\u2019s refusal to allow a revision of the tariff in these circumstances meant that AASA began to sustain losses. For example, it is alleged that by February 2003 AASA\u2019s costs of operation had increased 63% with no increase in tariffs. A particular source of increased costs and therefore losses was the fact that by virtue of the loans it had secured from multilateral lending agencies it was required to make loan service payments in United States Dollars, the costs of which in Argentine pesos had tripled. Ultimately, AASA\u2019s failure to make timely loan servicing payments led to the purchase of AASA\u2019s loans by the Claimant shareholders from the Multilateral lending agencies in March of 2006.\n\n51.\n\nAt the same time, ETOSS and the Argentine government were insisting that AASA comply fully with its investment obligations under the Concession Contract. Failure to meet specified investment targets resulted in fines imposed on AASA by the regulator.\n\n52.\n\nDuring the renegotiation process, Argentina also alleged certain performance failures on the part of AASA. Among others, these included allegations of high levels of nitrates in the water being distributed by AASA. AASA rejected these allegations and at the ICSID hearing on the merits intimated that they were merely pretexts for the failure of the Argentine government to revise the tariffs as required by the Concession Contract and ultimately for the government\u2019s abrupt termination of the Concession.\n\nG. *The Termination of the Concession*\n--------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nAASA\u2019s deteriorating financial situation and its increasingly troubled relationship with the government ultimately led the AASA shareholders to request the termination of the Concession Contract on 22 September 2005, a request that would eventually be denied three months later.\n\n54.\n\nIn February 2006, as part of an Agreement with the government, AASA asked to withdraw as a party to this case and the Tribunal approved that request.\n\n55.\n\nOn 17 March 2006, the government of Argentina opened a formal investigation into the nitrate levels in the water distributed by AASA.\n\n56.\n\nFour days later, on 21 March 2006 the government of Argentina terminated the Concession, alleging various faults committed by AASA and demanded payment of the performance bond established by the project sponsors at the time they assumed responsibility for the Concession. The water distribution and sewage system was immediately transferred to Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos S.A. (AySA), an entity owned, financed, and managed by the Argentine State, thus bringing to an end Argentina\u2019s thirteen-year experience with the privatization of the Buenos Aires water and sewage system.\n\n57.\n\nA corporate insolvency proceeding *(Concurso Preventivo)* with respect to AASA was begun in May 2006 in an Argentine court to settle the various rights and obligations arising out of the termination. In the meanwhile, the Claimants withdrew from the water and sewage business in Buenos Aires, having sustained large alleged losses which they claim amounted to US$1.0192 billion as of June 2008, and for which they now seek redress in this proceeding. In response, Argentina asserts that it sustained injuries valued at $2.4 billion as a result of various alleged failures by the Claimants to fulfill their obligations under the Concession. This Tribunal now has the duty to determine and adjudicate the parties\u2019 respective rights and obligations according to the applicable law.\n\n**III. The Law Applicable to This Dispute**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention states the rule governing the applicable law that this Tribunal is to follow in deciding this dispute. It provides that: \"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on conflict of law) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\n59.\n\nIn these cases, the Claimants are asserting certain rights accorded to them by reason of individual bilateral investment treaties concluded by the Argentine Republic with the Claimants\u2019 respective home countries. Thus, Claimants Suez and Vivendi, both incorporated in France, claim rights under the Argentina-France BIT, Claimant AGBAR, incorporated in Spain, claims rights under the Argentina-Spain BIT, and Claimant AWG, incorporated in the United Kingdom, claims rights under the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT. Those three agreements contain relatively similar provisions specifying the law that a tribunal is to apply in deciding a dispute arising thereunder. The governing laws specified in the treaties can be regarded as the \"rules of law agreed by the parties\" under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, when accepting to arbitrate under the terms of a treaty, the investor also accepts the choice of law provided in such treaty.\n\n60.\n\nArticle 8.4 of the Argentina-France BIT provides: \"The ruling of the arbitral body shall be based on the provisions of this Agreement, the legislation of the Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute, including rules governing conflict of laws, the terms of any private agreements concluded on the subject of the investment, and the relevant principles of international law.\"\n\n61.\n\nArticle X(5) of the Argentina-Spain BIT provides: \"The arbitral tribunal shall make its decision on the basis of this Agreement and, where appropriate, on the basis of other treaties in force between the Parties, the domestic law of the Party in whose territory the investment was made, including its norms of private international law, and the general principles of international law.\"\n\n62.\n\nArticle 8(4) of the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT provides: \"The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute, including its rules on conflict of laws, the terms of any specific Agreement concluded in relation to such an investment and the applicable principles of international law. The arbitration decision shall be final and binding on both Parties\".\n\n63.\n\nThese provisions make it clear that the relevant BIT shall primarily govern the investors\u2019 claim. They further provide that Argentine domestic law as well as international law may apply to every extent relevant. The provisions of the Argentina-France BIT and the Argentina-Spain BIT further allow for the application of the private and/or specific agreements concluded in relation to investments, which certainly includes the Concession Contract. However, claims for breach of the Concession Contract are not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whose jurisdiction is limited to claims arising under the BITs. In assessing these latter claims, the Tribunal will therefore primarily apply the BITs themselves as well as any relevant rules of international law. It may also refer to domestic laws or to the provisions of the Concession Contract relevant for the evaluation of the claims arising under the BITs, for instance as a reflection of the Claimants\u2019 expectations in applying BIT provisions on fair and equitable treatment.\n\n64.\n\nThe question that the Tribunal must answer is whether Argentina\u2019s treatment of the Claimants through its legislation, regulations, and administrative actions violated its commitments under the BITs. In order to assess such treatment, for example Argentina\u2019s actions to deal with its financial crisis, the Tribunal must make reference to and analyze Argentine law in order to judge whether those acts comply with or violate Argentina\u2019s international obligations under the BITs. But such internal legislation and regulations by themselves cannot legally override or modify Argentina\u2019s commitments and obligations in treaties to which it is a party.\n\n65.\n\nIndeed, in accordance with Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT), a party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform its treaty obligations. Thus, Argentina may not avoid its treaty commitments with respect to the treatment to be accorded the Claimants by invoking the provisions of its internal laws, regulations, or administrative acts.\n\n**IV. The Legal Framework of the AASA Concession**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nAn analysis of this investment dispute must begin with an understanding of the legal framework of the Concession granted to AASA, the company created by the Claimants, since that framework is an important source of the rights, obligations, and expectations of the Parties to the dispute. Moreover, the Concession Contract at the heart of this dispute expressly provides that its text is to be interpreted according to specified laws and regulations constituting that legal framework and that in the event of conflict between the text of the Concession Contract and such other elements of the legal framework, the latter are to prevail.33 We therefore proceed to examine briefly the various individual elements of that legal framework as it existed under Argentine law. One may group the elements of the legal framework into two parts: 1) the legislative and regulatory measures establishing the legal framework; and 2) the Concession Contract with AASA. The Argentina-France BIT, the Argentina-Spain BIT, and the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT, which form an important part of the international legal framework of this dispute, will be considered in subsequent sections of this Decision.\n\nArticle 1.6 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\nA. *Legislative and Regulatory Measures*\n----------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\n**The State Reform Law.** The legal impetus and foundation for the Concession that is the subject of these cases was **Law No. 23,696** ***(Ley de Emergencia Administrativa y Reforma del Estado)*** **of 23 August 1989,34** an act of the Argentine State declaring public services and enterprises to be in a state of emergency (Art. 1) and authorizing the Argentine President, referred to in the text as the National Executive Power *(Poder Ejecutivo Nacional),* to take specified remedial actions, particularly the privatization of State enterprises by various means, including the granting of concessions to private and foreign investors and to enterprises to operate individual public services (Art. 17). The Law also defined the procedure by which such privatizations were to be accomplished. This law, known as **\"the State Reform Law,\"** is therefore the basic authorizing legislation for the various acts leading to the establishment of the AASA Concession.\n\nExh. C-5.\n\n68.\n\n**The Privatization Decree.** Subsequent to this basic law, the Argentine President issued various decrees to set in motion the development of a legal and regulatory process to govern the granting of concessions. One of these was **Decree No. 2074/90 of 5 October 199035,** providing that various State entities then under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works and Services, including OSN, the State entity then entrusted with providing water distribution and waste water services to the Buenos Aires area, were to be privatized. Article 3 of the Decree called for a concession to be granted over the services operated by OSN and directed that bidding rules and conditions be prepared to govern a public, national, and international competitive bidding process by which the future concessionaire was to be selected.\n\nExh. C-7.\n\n69.\n\nIn order to begin the execution of the above indicated Decree, the Ministry of Economy issued **Resolution No. 97/91 of 10 May 1991,36** creating the *Comisi\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica de Privatizaci\u00f3n de Obras Sanitarias de la Naci\u00f3n,* known as the \"Privatization Committee,\" to draft the rules to govern the privatization process, international bidding, and the provisions that were to be part of the Concession Contract.\n\nExh. C-13.\n\n70.\n\n**The Convertibility Law.** Although Argentina had thus initiated a privatization process in 1989, the envisioned regulatory framework was not to emerge for another three years. In the meanwhile, Argentina continued to experience severe inflation and monetary instability, factors which negatively affected the investment climate in the country. In an effort to curb inflation, Argentina, at the initiative of a new Minister of the Economy (Domingo Cavallo), enacted **Law No. 23,928** ***(Ley de la Convertibilidad del Austral)*** **of 28 March 1991.37** Known as the **\"Convertibility Law,\"** this legislative act, effective from 1 April 1991, basically did two things. First, under Article 1, the law tied or \"pegged\" the exchange rate of Argentine currency to the U.S. dollar by guaranteeing that the Central Bank of Argentina would exchange a fixed amount of Argentine currency for a fixed amount of U.S. dollars. At the time of its enactment, the law provided that the Central Bank would exchange 10,000 Argentine Australs for one U.S. dollar. Shortly thereafter, **Decree No. 2128/91 of 17 October 199 138** replaced the Austral with the Peso as the national currency, so that until the financial crisis of 2001 the Peso was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a rate of one peso per dollar. Second, the Convertibility Law placed various limitations on the actions of the Central Bank in an effort to prevent it from increasing the monetary supply to meet internal government fiscal needs, which in the past had led to severe inflation in the country. Thus, the Convertibility Law required the Central Bank to hold an amount of dollars, gold, or foreign exchange at least equivalent to 100% of Argentina\u2019s domestic monetary base, the effect of which was to strictly limit the legal authority of the Central Bank to increase the supply of pesos, a limitation intended to reduce inflation and foster the monetary stability necessary to encourage investment.\n\nBolet\u00edn Oficial, 28 March 1991, p. 6 (Exh. C-12).\n\nExh. C-17.\n\n71.\n\nAs these measures began to have effect and inflation in the country began to abate, the Argentine government accelerated work on the privatization of the water distribution and sewage system in the capital of Buenos Aires. An important step in this direction was the issuance by the Ministry of Works and Public Services of **Resolution No. 178/91 of 13 December 1991,39** specifying the prequalification bidding rules, the purpose of which was to establish minimum standards that interested parties had to meet to bid for the concession. Among other qualifications, eligible bidders were to have a minimum net worth of US$1 billion and were required to include an operator who had experience in operating a water and waste water service in a city with a minimum of 500,000 inhabitants and to demonstrate that it had served at least two million persons.\n\nExh. C-24.\n\n72.\n\n**The Water Decree.** A further major step in constructing a legal framework for the Concession took place when the President of the Republic, acting under the authority granted him by Law No. 23,696, cited above, issued **Decree No. 999/92 of 30 June 1992,40** generally known as the **\"Water Decree,\"** which formally approved a legal and regulatory framework (contained in Annex I of the Decree) for the privatization of the water distribution and sewage system in the Federal capital of Buenos Aires and various other municipalities in the Province of Buenos Aires, which were then under the authority of OSN. The regulatory framework thus created had according to Article 3 of the Water Decree five basic objectives: 1) to guarantee the maintenance and to promote the expansion of the system for potable water distribution and the collection of household and industrial sewage; 2) to establish a normative system that guaranteed the continued quality of the regulated public service; 3) to regulate and protect the rights, obligations and attributions of the users of the system, the conceding authority, the concessionaire, and the Regulatory Entity; 4) to guarantee the operation of current services and those provided in the future at a level of quality and efficiency indicated in the legal framework; and 5) to protect public health, water resources, and the environment.\n\nExh. C-33.\n\n73.\n\nIn order to achieve these objectives, specific chapters of the Water Decree provided for: the definition of the nature and extent of the service and area covered by the concession and the definition of various terms used in the Decree (Chapter I), general rules governing the Concession (Chapter II), the Regulatory Entity *(Ente Regulador)* (Chapter III), the Concessionaire (Chapter IV), protection of service users (Chapter V), quality of service (Chapter VI), the tariff regime (Chapter VII), payment for services (Chapter VIII), plans for service expansion (Chapter IX), the property regime (Chapter X), termination of the concession (Chapter XI), dispute settlement (Chapter XII) and complementary and transitional norms (Chapter XIII). We will briefly review each chapter of the Water Decree.\n\n74.\n\nChapter II of the Water Decree, entitled *\"Concesi\u00f3n del Servicio,\"* set down important general principles to govern the concession. Thus, Article 6 required that the public services subject to the concession must obligatorily be provided in conditions that assured its continuity, regularity, and quality, as well as in a manner that assured its efficient provision to users and the protection of the environment. Moreover, it was to employ the system of the public service concession, and its legal regime was to consist of Law No. 23,696, the provisions of the Water Decree, the Concession Contract, and, supplementarily, the general principles governing public service concession contracts (Art. 7). These provisions made clear that the Buenos Aires water and sewage system, although managed under a concession with a private operator, nonetheless remained a public service.\n\n75.\n\nAs a public service, the concessionaire and the water and sewage service were subject to the control of the Regulatory Entity, whose organization, duties, and powers were specified in Chapter III of the Water Decree.41 The Regulatory Entity, known as the *\"Ente Tripartito de Obras y Servicios Sanitarios* (ETOSS),42 was created by Law No. 23,696. Integrating the three concerned jurisdictions of the city of Buenos Aires, the Province of Buenos Aires and *Obras Sanitarias de la Naci\u00f3n,* the federal entity theretofore charged with providing water and sewage services to the concerned area, ETOSS was an autonomous legal entity having broad powers to control and regulate the concessionaire. Its powers included approving tariffs, verifying the application of the tariff regime, sanctioning the Concessionaire for violations of the Concession Contract, and approving expansion plans of the Concessionaire.43\n\nArticle 13 of the Water Decree (Exh. C-33).\n\nArticles 1 and 15 of the Water Decree (Exh. C-33).\n\nSee Article 17 of the Water Decree (Exh. C-33).\n\n76.\n\nChapter IV of the Water Decree listed the responsibilities and obligations of the Concessionaire in operating the water and sewage system and also specified the procedure by which the Concession contract with the Concessionaire was to be made.\n\n77.\n\nChapter V of the Water Decree sought to provide for the legal protection of the users of the water and sewage services operated by the Concessionaire by defining the rights of both actual and potential users, including the right to service according to the provisions of the Water Decree, the right to required levels of service quality, the right to make claims against the Concessionaire for inadequate service, and the right to bring complaints against the Concessionaire before the Regulatory Entity, among others44. In order to give effect to complaints by users, the Concessionaire would be required to maintain a Complaints Office *(Oficina de Reclamos)* staffed by competent persons and accessible to users.\n\nArticle 34 of the Water Decree (Exh. C-33).\n\n78.\n\nService quality being an important goal of the water decree, Chapter VI defined in general terms the quality obligations of the Concessionaire with respect to the operation of the service. The principal objective of the quality provisions of the Water Decree was to assure the provision of adequate service with respect to population and area coverage, water quality, water pressure, continuity of service, minimal service interruptions, effective treatment of sewage effluents, and responsiveness to the needs of the users.45\n\nArticles 38 and 42 of the Water Decree (Exh. C-33).\n\n79.\n\nThe basic elements of the tariff regime of the Concession were set out in Chapter VII of the Water Decree, as well as in the Concession Contract. These elements concerned: (a) the \"initial tariff regime\" *(R\u00e9gimen Tarifario inicial),* that is, the tariff regime established at the commencement of the Concession; and (b) programs and rules for periodic tariff revisions and the mechanism for such revisions. Any revisions to the tariff regime had to accord with the provisions of the Water Decree and required the intervention of the Regulatory Entity.46 The general principles governing the tariff regime were elaborated in Article 44 of the Water Decree, portions of which the Claimants rely on heavily in presenting their case. Because of its role in this dispute, it is worthwhile examining the whole of Article 44 in detail.\n\nArticle 43 of the Water Decree (Exh. C-33).\n\n80.\n\nArticle 44 states that the tariff regime of the Concession is to be adjusted *(se ajustar\u00e1)* according to the following five principles:\n\na. Its propensity to offer a rational and efficient use of the offered services and the resources involved in its provision;\n\nb. The possibility of a consistent balance between the supply and the demand for services. The Concessionaire may not voluntarily restrict the supply of services;\n\nc. Attaining the health and social objectives directly linked to its provision;\n\nd. \"The prices and tariffs shall *tend (tender\u00e1n)* to reflect the economic cost of the water and wastewater services, including a margin of profit for the Concessionaire and incorporating all costs arising from the approved expansion plans.\" (emphasis added);47 and\n\ne. It shall be permitted that the tariff applied to any category of users shall balance the economic cost specified in paragraph d) by other users of the system, thus providing for the possibility of cross-subsidies among user categories.\n\nArticle 44 concludes with the following general principle to be followed by the tariff system: \"The amount resulting from the tariffs charged to users shall *(deber\u00e1)* permit the Concessionaire, when operating efficiently, to obtain sufficient income to cover the implicit costs of the operation, maintenance and expansion of the services provided.\"48\n\nThe original Spanish version of Article 44(d) reads as follows: \"(d) Los precios y tarifas tender\u00e1n a reflejar el costo econ\u00f3mico de la prestaci\u00f3n de los servicios de agua potable y desag\u00fces cloacales incluyendo el margen de beneficio del Concesionario e incorporando los costos emergentes de los planes expansi\u00f3n aprobados.\" (Exh. C-33).\n\nThe original Spanish of this provision of Article 44 reads as follows: \"El monto resultante de las tarifas facturadas a los Usuarios deber\u00e1 permitir al Concesionario, cuando \u00e9ste opera eficientemente, obtener ingresos suficientes para satisfacer los costos impl\u00edcitos en la operaci\u00f3n, mantenimiento y expansi\u00f3n de los servicios prestados.\" (Exh. C-33).\n\n81.\n\nThe Water Decree in Article 45 further states the basic elements of the tariff structure, providing for tariffs based on measured or metered usage and tariffs based on a fixed cost, while specifying the types of users to which each system applied. Under its provisions, the following types of users must be subject to measured (metered) usage: (a) non residential users; (b) \"block water sales\"; (c) other cases at the option of the Concessionaire; and (d) at the option of users, cases not covered by (a) or (b) above. It appears that one of the goals of Article 45 was the progressive installation of measured or metered usage throughout the system.\n\n82.\n\nUnder Article 46 of the Water Decree, the actual tariffs applicable under the Concession were initially to be fixed in the Concession Contract and later might be adjusted in two ways: (a) as part of plans for expansion and improvement of the service approved by the Regulatory Entity within the framework of periodic revisions provided in the Concession Contract or (b) in accordance with provisions on \"extraordinary revisions.\" The Regulatory Entity was empowered under Article 47 to regulate tariffs on the basis of an analysis of improvement and expansion plans submitted periodically by the Concessionaire. In setting tariffs in such case, the Regulatory Entity was to be guided by the following principle: \"The tariff regulation variable shall be the amount of income that the Concessionaire receives per year for the services provided in relation to the number of users served and the efficiency conditions proposed in each plan.\"49 The term \"tariff regulation variable\" *(la variable de regulaci\u00f3n tarifaria)* is not defined in the text in the Water Decree and is not completely clear in its own terms, but it would appear to mean that the amount of income to be received by the Concessionaire each year is to be based on the number of users and the efficiency of the plans proposed.\n\nThe original Spanish of this provision in Article 47 reads as follows: \"La variable de regulaci\u00f3n tarifaria ser\u00e1 el monto de ingresos que el Concesionario reciba por los servicios que preste en funci\u00f3n del n\u00fameros de Usuarios servidos en cada a\u00f1o, y las condiciones de eficiencia que se propongan en cada plan.\" (Exh. C-33).\n\n83.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Concession was to continue over thirty years, it was important and expected that the Water Decree include a mechanism to revise tariffs in the light of changing circumstances. Article 48 of the Water Decree provides for such mechanisms. It specified two types of tariff revisions: periodic revisions and extraordinary revisions. Periodic revisions are those arising from expansion plans approved by the Regulatory Entity and necessary for satisfying or exceeding the quality and coverage standards stipulated in the Concession Contract. Extraordinary tariff revisions are those arising from four specified events: a) significant variations in the Concessionaire\u2019s costs according to the provisions of the Concession Contract; b) substantial and unforeseen changes in the conditions for the provision of services and in the quality standards of drinking water and waste water, such changes being justified in relation to investments in and costs of operation of the service; c) when such efficiency conditions conflict with the objectives of Article 44 and the requirements of Article 47 the Concessionaire or the Regulatory Entity may request an exceptional revision according to the Concession Contract; and d) when another regime is proposed that will permit the attainment of increases in efficiency and result in a better application of the principles of Article 44. Article 48 provides that no revision may be used to penalize a Concessionaire for past profits or operations nor may it be used as compensation for losses arising from business risk *(riesgo empresario)* or to compensate for inefficiencies in the delivery of services. Thus losses incurred by the Concessionaire from normal operations of the system would not justify a tariff increase under the Water Decree.\n\n84.\n\nChapter VIII of the Water Decree concerned the principles governing payment for service. In general terms, the Concessionaire had the right and obligation to collect payment for services provided, and the Water Decree imposed an obligation on users, including the State, its subdivisions, and State entities, to pay for services. If the Concessionaire was directed by the government to provide free or subsidized services to certain classes of consumers, payment for them was to be made from the National Treasury.\n\n85.\n\nChapter IX deals with the process for preparing and approving plans to expand and improve service. In developing such plans, the Concessionaire was to consult with users, local and national authorities, and the Regulatory Entity. The Concessionaire had the obligation to execute approved plans and failure to do so under Article 57 was considered a \"serious fault *(falta grave)\"*\n\n86.\n\nChapter X of the Water Decree governed the Property Regime of the Concession. The Decree applied to all property transferred to the Concessionaire as well as to property that the Concessionaire later acquired or constructed for the purpose of meeting its obligations arising out of the Concession Contract. Such property constituted a unity *(unidad de afectaci\u00f3n).* The Concessionaire had the right to administer them according to the provisions of the Concession Contract, but it did not own them. The Concessionaire also had an obligation to maintain and protect such property. At the end of the Concession, the Concessionaire was required to transfer to the State without charge, all property and assets used in the service in good condition *(buenas condiciones)* as an integrated system in a correct state of operation.\n\n87.\n\nChapter XI treated the termination of the Concession Contract in general terms. The Contract was to terminate upon completion of the contractual period or by its cancellation through action of the President and with the intervention of the Regulatory Entity.\n\n88.\n\nChapter XII of the Water Decree concerned disputes affecting the Concession and provided that the National Administrative Procedure Law was to apply to such disputes without prejudice to the rights of the parties to seek a judicial remedy. For disputes not arising out of the exercise of police power under Article 17, conflicts between the Regulatory Entity and the Concessionaire might also be settled by arbitration or amicable means by agreement of the parties.\n\n89.\n\n**The Bidding Rules.** To put in motion the required public international competitive bidding process to select a concessionaire, Argentina issued Bidding Rules *(Pliego de Bases y Condiciones)50* on 24 June 1992. The Bidding Rules defined in detail the procedure by which OSN was to be privatized and the standards to be used in evaluating bids. The Bidding Rules consisted of 4 parts: (i) general aspects of the Concession, including its purpose, term, and rules of interpretation; (ii) the bidding procedure; (iii) rules regarding the Concession Contract, including the tariff regimes, the obligations and rights of the parties, its investments, and financing; and (iv) annexes that included a Model of the Concession Contract for the service.\n\nExh. C-32.1.\n\n90.\n\nThe Bidding Rules51 expressly provided that potential bidders could ask for clarifications of its provisions. In fact, they did so, and Argentina responded to these questions in documents referred to as *Aclaratorias al Pliego* (clarifications to the Bidding Rules). Many of these questions concerned the tariff system, particularly the elements to be considered in making tariff revisions. Ultimately, as a result of the clarification process, Argentina issued new bidding rules, referred to in Claimants\u2019 pleadings as **Revised Bidding Rules,52** which contained changes and clarifications requested or recommended by potential bidders. In the text of the Revised Bidding Rules, as issued in the Secretariat of Public Works and Communications Resolution No. 249/42 of 24 August 1991, such modifications are indicated in italics, and Annex XI of the Revised Bidding Rules, which includes a Model Concession Contract, provided that all modifications of the original bidding rules would have direct application to the Model Contract contained in the Revised Bidding Rules. The Tribunal\u2019s analysis will focus in particular on the Revised Bidding Rules as an element in the legal framework of the AASA Concession.\n\nArticle 2.5 (Exh. C-32).\n\nResolution S.O.P. y C. No. 249/42 of 24 August 1992 (Resolution of the Secretariat of Public Works and Communications) (Exh. C-36).\n\n91.\n\nThe Revised Bidding Rules began with a lengthy \"Introduction\", which explained the background to the decision to grant a concession to a private operator to provide water and waste water services previously provided by OSN, and provided that the concessionaire would be subject to a regulatory regime concerning the charges, quality, and payment for the services provided to the users. The Introduction gave a very general description of the existing service but it also noted that the quality of available information about the existing service was limited due to its lack of a modem system of controls and metering.\n\n92.\n\nSection I of the Revised Bidding Rules provided for basic terms of the proposed Concession, including its objective, period, basic applicable norms, definitions of important terms, and rules of interpretation, most of which were ultimately integrated directly and verbatim into the Concession Contract, to be discussed below.\n\n93.\n\nSection II of the Revised Bidding Rules defined the procedure for the bidding and tendering process that was to determine the future concessionaire. It provided that the bid was to consist of two parts or \"envelopes,\" one addressing the technical aspects of the bid and the second the economic and financial aspects.\n\n94.\n\nOf particular importance were the rules concerning the economic and financial bid, since it was that bid which, all other things being equal, would determine the winner of the Concession Contract. Annex X to the Revised Bidding Rules contained a description of the Tariff Regime, which was expressed as a numerical value, referred to as the \"K\" factor, which was a reference tariff. Each economic and financial bid was to contain a number, carried out to three decimal places, either greater than, less than, or equal to one. This number was referred to in the Revised Bidding Rules as the K Factor Coefficient of Adjustment, otherwise known as the CAFK Coefficient. The CAFK, when multiplied by the K Factor would result in the tariff regime to be applied throughout the period of the Concession.53 Thus, a low CAFK would result in a low proposed tariff and a high CAFK would result in a high proposed tariff.\n\nArticle 4.4.1, Revised Bidding Rules (Exh. C-36).\n\n95.\n\nIn the evaluation process, the bids received were to be rank ordered according to increasing proposed CAFK. The offer with the lowest proposed CAFK was to be considered the winner of the bidding tender and preliminarily determined to be capable of being awarded the Concession.54 Thus, the Revised Bidding Rules appeared to have been designed in order to secure a Concessionaire that would operate the system at the lowest possible tariff rate.\n\nArticle 4.6, Revised Bidding Rules: \"Las ofertas, cuyo Sobre 2 hubiese sido descalificado seg\u00fan 4.5, ser\u00e1n ordenadas seg\u00fan coeficientes CAFK crecientes. De entre ellas, aquella oferta de menor CAFK ser\u00e1 considerada ganadora de la licitaci\u00f3n y pre adjudicatario susceptible de ser adjudicada.\"(Exh. C-36).\n\n96.\n\nThe Revised Bidding Rules further stipulated in some detail the nature of the documentation and information required to accompany the bid, the procedure by which the bid would be analyzed and evaluated, the method by which a decision would be made to decide on the winning bid, and the process for resolving any challenges to such decision. They also stipulated that the winning bidder must form a company *(sociedad an\u00f3nima)* under Argentine law and that such concessionary company must have certain specified legal characteristics, including a minimum capital of US$120,000,000, that the operator of the Concession hold at least 25% of such capital, that the domicile and seat of the company be located in the City of Buenos Aires, and that the object of the company be the performance of the Concession exclusively.\n\n97.\n\nSection III of the Revised Bidding Rules specified the provisions to be included in the Concession Contract, particularly the obligations of the Concessionaire with regard to service quality, development and investment in the water and waste water system, relations with the Regulatory Entity, studies and plans for the development of the system, five year investment plans, the property regime, the regimes governing Concession property and personnel, and the tariff regimes. These principles were for the most part incorporated into the Concession Contract, usually verbatim, and will be discussed in detail below. It is to be noted that the Revised Bidding Rules also contained 21 annexes, including a Model Concession Contract, an inventory of existing property and installations to be taken over by the future concessionaire, the tariff framework of the Concession, and the applicable regulatory framework, among others.\n\nB. *The Concession Contract*\n----------------------------\n\n98.\n\n**The Concession Contract.** A lengthy and detailed document of 129 pages, plus annexes, the Concession Contract between the Argentine State, referred to in the Contract as \"the Conceding Authority\" (\"el Concedente\") and Aguas Argentinas S.A., referred to as \"the Concessionaire\" (\"el Concesionario\"), was signed on 28 April 1993 and became effective at midnight on 1 May 1993, when AASA took possession of the conceded water and waste water system in the Buenos Aires area. The purpose of the Concession Contract was to specify the respective rights and responsibilities of the parties concerning the transfer, operation, and development of that system during the term of the Concession, a period of thirty years that was to terminate on April 30, 2023. As indicated above, the Concession by its terms was to be interpreted and applied within a stated hierarchy of legal norms set down in Article 1.6. These norms included: 1) Law No. 23,696 (the State Reform Law; 2) the Water Decree; 3) the Bidding rules and the various related clarifications; and 4) the bid offer by AASA as approved by act of the Privatization Committee.\n\n99.\n\nThe Concession Contract is divided into twelve chapters. Chapter 1 on General Aspects states the purposes of the Concession, defines important terms used in the Contract, sets down rules of interpretation, and specifies the duration of the Concession as thirty years from the date of AASA\u2019s taking possession of the system. It is also to be noted that the Concession Contract states that the Concession is granted to AASA free of any required payment or \"canon\" by AASA.55 Many of the provisions in the Concession Contract are particularized versions of the principles stated in the Water Decree and the Bidding Rules.\n\nArticle 1.4 (Exh. C-44).\n\n100.\n\nChapter 2 entitled \"Concessionary Company\" *(Sociedad Concesionaria)* concerns the concessionary company and, as required by the Revised Bidding Rules, established basic principles concerning its minimum capital (US$120,000,000), requires its domicile to be the city of Buenos Aires, and states that the purpose of the company throughout the period of the concession to be exclusively the performance of the Concession Contract. Moreover, it requires the Operator (then Lyonnaise des Eaux, now Suez) to hold 25% of the Company\u2019s capital, in addition to other rules affecting its shareholders. An annexed Management Contract governed the rights and responsibilities of the Operator.\n\n101.\n\nChapter 3 of the Concession Contract defined the process by which AASA was to take possession of the system and set down certain rules to be followed during this transitional phase of operations, including those governing the continuing status of existing personnel, contracts, credits, and obligations of OSN. AASA, the Concessionaire, was not to assume the debts of OSN;56 however, the Contract gave AASA the option to assume a $98 million loan, approved but not yet executed, by the Inter-American Development Bank, to the Argentine State for capital improvements in the drinking water system, if certain specified conditions were met.\n\nArticle 3.11 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n102.\n\nIn Chapter 4, the Concession Contract stated the service norms to be followed by AASA in carrying out the water and sewage concession. These norms dealt with the continuity, regularity, quality and generality of service to be provided by the Concessionaire to the users. Specific provisions concerned area coverage of the systems, specified water pressure requirements, required water flow volumes, service cuts, waste water overflows, treatment of effluents, and required levels of customer relations.\n\n103.\n\nAs a public service, the Concession was subject to close regulation by the Regulatory Entity, and Chapter 5 of the Concession Contract sought to define the principles governing the relationship between the Concessionaire and the Regulatory Entity. As a general principle, the two parties were \"... to establish and maintain a fluid relationship that facilitates the performance of this Concession Contract.\"57 The Concessionaire by the terms of the Concession Contract had an obligation to cooperate with the Regulatory Entity, and the nature of that required cooperation was specified in some detail. At the same time, the Concession Contract required the Regulatory Entity to cooperate with the Concessionaire by among other things \"... exercising its police, regulatory, and control powers in a reasonable manner, considering especially the rights and interests of the users.\"58\n\nArticle 5.1 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\nArticle 5.3 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n104.\n\nThe fact that the Concessionaire was to be transferred the possession of an existing water and sewage system with its personnel for which it would have the responsibility for effective management, development, and expansion during a fixed period of time and further that it had the obligation to transfer that system back to the Argentine State upon the termination of the Concession required special rules concerning the property and personnel of the system and any contracts made by the Concessionaire during the life of the Concession. Accordingly, Chapter 6 of the Concession Contract defines the rules governing the property regime *(r\u00e9gimen de bienes),* specifying the various categories of property subject to the Concession and the rules governing their acquisition, use, protection, amortization, and disposal. Among other things, it provided that at the end of the thirty-year term of the Concession, the Concessionaire was to transfer without financial payment back to the Argentine State all assets of the Concession, including those it had subsequently acquired or constructed.59 Chapter 7 on the Personnel Regime *(R\u00e9gimen de Personal)* governs basic rights of Concession employees. Chapter 8 on the Tax Regime *(R\u00e9gimen Tributario)* makes the Concession liable for the payment of various taxes and government charges, while Chapter 9 on the Contractual Regime *(R\u00e9gimen de Contratos)* provided for a system by which the Concession, a public service, is to make contracts with third parties.\n\nArticle 6.9.2 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n105.\n\nIn order to assure the performance of the Concession and the provision of the crucial public services it governs, the Concession Contract in Chapter 10 required the Concessionaire to establish a bank guarantee of US$150,000,000, subject to periodic readjustment on the basis of inflation and changes in investment plans, in favor of the Argentine State.60 Chapter 10 of the Concession Contract, entitled \"Guarantees and Insurance\" *(Garant\u00edas y Seguros),* defined the nature of this guarantee, the contingencies and risks that it covered, and the conditions under which it might be executed. Chapter 10 also specified the type of insurance (primarily liability insurance, worker accident insurance, property damage, and life insurance), which the Concessionaire must maintain throughout the period of the Concession Contract.\n\nArticle 10.1.1 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n106.\n\nThe Concession Contract\u2019s provisions on tariffs, contained in Chapter 11 (\"The Economic and Tariff Regime\" *(R\u00e9gimen Tarifario y Econ\u00f3mico)),* as well as in Annex VII, are central to the present dispute between the Parties. The first part of Chapter 10, and its related Annex VII, established the tariffs to be charged to users at the beginning of the Concession. Article 11.3 stipulates that such tariff shall remain in force throughout the period of the Concession, without prejudice to the application of Article 11.11, which concerned tariff revisions. Article 11.11 authorized and defined the procedures for revising tariffs by the Regulatory Entity. Under the Concession Contract, tariff revisions could not be used to penalize the Concessionaire for past profits earned nor might it be used to compensate the Concessionaire for losses arising out of business risks.61 The Concession Contract specifically stated in Article 11.11.1.3: \"The Concession is based on the principle of business risk.\"62 In considering requests for tariff revisions, the Regulatory Entity was always to take into account the principles of Article 44 of the Water Decree,63 discussed above.\n\nArticle 11.11.1.2 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n\"La Concesi\u00f3n est\u00e1 basada en el principio del riesgo empresario.\u2019\u2019(Exh. C-44).\n\nArticle 11.11.1.5 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n107.\n\nFollowing the principles of the Water Decree and the Revised Bidding Rules, the Concession Contract provided for three types of tariff revisions: 1) Ordinary revisions *(Revisiones Ordinarias),* covered in Article 11.11.3 of the Concession Contract; 2) Extraordinary Revisions for Change of Costs *(Revisi\u00f3n Extraordinaria por Modificaci\u00f3n de Costos),* covered in Article 11.11.4; and 3) Other Extraordinary Revisions *(Otras Revisiones Extraordinarias),* covered in Article 11.11.5.\n\n108.\n\nOrdinary revisions were to take place only due to changes in the five-year investment plans proposed by the Concessionaire. Pursuant to the Revised Bidding Rules, bidders were required to submit an investment plan for the thirty-year period of the Concession divided into individual five-year plans *(Plan Quinquenal).* The winning bidder was to execute its proposed thirty-year investment plan and presumably its proposed tariff was to take account of these longterm investment requirements. Because of changing circumstances and needs, the Concession Contract recognized that such investment plans might have to be modified and the prevailing tariff revised accordingly. Article 11.11.3 of the Concession Contract established the standards and processes for effecting such ordinary tariff revisions.\n\n109.\n\nExtraordinary Revisions for Change in Costs were to take place whenever an increase or decrease of more than 7% occurred in the costs of a specified and exclusive list of elements needed in the operation of the Concession, as follows: fuel, chemical products, electricity, insurance, personnel, construction materials, spare parts, vehicles, debt payments, and financial costs64 Article 11.11.4.2 specifies the methods for calculating such increases or decreases in the cost of these items, usually by reference to particular indices.\n\nArticle 11.11.4.2 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n110.\n\nIn addition to an Extraordinary Revision for Changes in Costs, the Concession Contract provided for possible extraordinary revisions of tariffs on the happening of certain specified events in Article 11.11.5. These specified events are as follows: 1) changes in applicable required standards that result in substantial change in the conditions of providing service; 2) the need to make substantial changes in the provision of service or the works needed for the provision of such service; 3) legal changes in the currency parity fixed by the Convertibility Law, the creation of new taxes, or the modification or elimination of existing taxes that directly affect the Concessionaire; and 4) the enactment of new environmental laws or changes in the provision of those in force that directly affect the provision of service by the Concessionaire. For both types of Extraordinary tariff revisions, the Concession Contract requires the Regulatory Entity to make a decision within thirty days.65\n\nArticle 11.11.6 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n111.\n\nThe remaining provisions of Chapter 11 set down various principles governing the modification of the tariff regime, one of which was that while the Regulatory Entity is authorized to make changes in the tariff regime in order to achieve social objectives such changes could not result in a variation in the total amount of tariff revenue invoiced by the Concessionaire.66\n\nArticle 11.12.4 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n112.\n\nThroughout the period of the Concession, the Concessionaire had an obligation to undertake studies, develop expansion and improvement plans, maintain records, and make information available on the details of the service that it was providing. Chapter 12, entitled \"Studies, Plans and Reports\" *(Estudios, Planes, e Informes)* specified in detail the nature of the Concessionaire\u2019s obligations with respect to these matters. In particular, it had to prepare Service Improvement and Expansion Plans *(Plan de Mejora y Expansi\u00f3n del Servicio),* known as a PMES, and Five-Year Plans *(Planes Quinquenales)* to guide the development of the water and waste water systems so as to meet the needs of the area served.\n\n113.\n\nChapter 13 of the Concession Contract deals with the obligations of the Concessionaire in providing service under the Concession, with non-performance, and resulting sanctions that may be imposed on the Concessionaire. Article 13.1 stated the basic nature of the Concessionaire\u2019s responsibility: the Concessionaire was to assume the Concession at its own technical, economic, and financial risk and was responsible to the Argentine State and to third parties for the obligations and requirements from the beginning of the service as of the time it took possession. Neither the Conceding Authority *(i.e.* the Argentine State) nor the Regulatory Entity was responsible to third persons for the obligations assumed by the Concessionaire. Failure to meet its obligations could result in one of three sanctions: warning *(apercibimiento),* fines, or rescission of the contract. The Regulatory Entity had the power to apply the first two, but only the President could rescind the Concession Contract.67 Chapter 13 defined the norms to be applied in judging and sanctioning the Concessionaire, the procedure to be followed, and the nature of warnings and fines to be imposed by the Regulatory Entity.\n\nArticle 13.3 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n114.\n\nChapter 14 concerned the Termination and Extension of the Concession *(Extinci\u00f3n y Pr\u00f3rroga de la Concesi\u00f3n).* Article 14.1 stated that termination of the Concession Contract may be caused by the expiration of the period of the Contract, cancellation due to the fault of the Concessionaire, cancellation due to the fault of the Conceding Authority, cancellation for act of God or force majeure *(caso fortuito o fuerza mayor),* bankruptcy *(concurso preventivo),* dissolution or liquidation of the Concessionaire or recovery *(rescate)* of the service. It then defines in detail the nature of each of these causes for termination. For example, among the thirteen specified faults of the Concessionaire justifying termination of the Concession contract are service failures to carry out the legal provisions or regulatory provisions either of the Regulatory Entity or the Contract and repeated and unjustified delays in making agreed annual or projected investments68\n\nArticles 14.3.1 and 14.3.2 of the Concession Contract (Exh. C-44).\n\n115.\n\nAt the same time, the Concession Contract gave the Concessionaire the right to terminate the contract for fault committed by the Conceding Authority. On this point, Article 14.4 provided as follows: \"The Concessionaire may rescind the contract for fault of the Conceding Authority whenever a normative provision, legal action, act or omission of the Regulatory Entity or the Conceding Authority *(Concedente)* results in a serious failure to perform an obligation assumed by the Conceding Authority in this contract.\"69\n\nThe original Spanish version of section 14.4 reads as follows:  \n \"14.4 Culpa del Concedente  \n El Concesionario podr\u00e1 rescindir este Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n por culpa del Concedente, cuando de una disposici\u00f3n normativa, acto, hecho o omisi\u00f3n del Ente Regulador o del proprio Concedente, resulte un incumplimiento grave de las obligaciones asumidas por al Concedente en este Contrato.\"\n\n116.\n\nThe consequences of termination by fault of the Concessionaire and termination by fault of the Conceding Authority are set out in Articles 14.8.2 and 14.8.3 of the Concession Contract, respectively.\n\n117.\n\nIn the event of termination by fault of the Concessionaire, Article 14.8.2. stated that three basic consequences would result. First, the Contract performance guarantee established by the Concessionaire will be lost *(se perder\u00e1),* without prejudice to the obligation of the Concessionaire to indemnify all damage and injuries caused to the Conceding authority or the service.70 Second, the unamortized value of the assets and property dedicated to the service by the Concessionaire, which was to be reimbursed to the Concessionaire, will be retained until the final liquidation of the reciprocal credit and debts and until the settlement of all judicial actions by the Conceding authority or the Regulatory Entity against the Concessionaire.71 Thus, the Concessionaire\u2019s right to be paid the unamortized value of its investment in the service was deferred until a final accounting could be performed. Third, the Regulatory Entity had the right to effect a provisional liquidation of the credits and debts arising from the Concession in order to satisfy the pending claims of the Regulatory Entity or of the Argentine State.\n\nThe first paragraph of section 14.8.2 states as follows in the original Spanish:  \n \"En caso de rescisi\u00f3n por culpa de Concesionario, se perder\u00e1 autom\u00e1ticamente la Garant\u00eda de Cumplimiento del Contrato sin peijuicio de la obligaci\u00f3n de Concesionario de indemnizar todos los da\u00f1os y peijuicios causados al Concedente y al servicio.\"\n\nThe original Spanish version of the second paragraph of section 14.8.2 reads as follows:  \n \"El valor de los bienes afectados al servicio, adquiridos o construidos por al Concesionario y no amortizados totalmente, que correspondiera ser restituido, se retendr\u00e1 hasta el momento de realizarse una liquidaci\u00f3n definitiva de los cr\u00e9ditos y deudas rec\u00edprocas y hasta que se extinga cualquier demanda judicial indemnizatoria promovida por el Concedente o el Ente Regulador contra el Concesionario.\"\n\n118.\n\nIn the event of termination of the Contract through the fault of the Conceding Authority, the Concessionaire was to recover the Contract performance guarantee and the value of the unamortized assets acquired or constructed by the Concessionaire pursuant to approved Five-Year Investment Plans, as well as damages arising directly out of the termination, and these will be credited directly. The Concessionaire was also to be indemnified for lost profits *(lucro cesante),* not to exceed the amount of profit made by the company during its last five financial years or, failing that, during as many financial years as preceded the expiration of the term of the Concession. In the event that termination takes place before the end of the fifth financial year, indemnifiable lost profits shall not be greater than five times the average of the profits earned by the company during the period that the Concession lasted.72\n\nArticle 14.8.3, Termination for Fault of the Conceding Authority, states as follows in the original Spanish:  \n \"En caso de recisi\u00f3n por culpa del Concedente, o de rescate, se restituir\u00e1 la Garant\u00eda de Cumplimiento del Contrato, el valor de los bienes no amortizados adquiridos o construidos por el Concesionario, conforme los Planes Quinquenales aprobados y se indemnizar\u00e1 al mismo los da\u00f1os emergentes de la recisi\u00f3n, y que se acreditaren debidamente.  \n El lucro cesante, si es que el mismo existiera, solo ser\u00e1 indemnizado en caso de culpa del Concedente. En ning\u00fan caso el lucro cesante indemnizable ser\u00e1 superior a la suma de las utilidades de la sociedad durante los \u00faltimos cinco (5) ejercicios, o durante tantos ejercicios inmediatos anteriores como faltaran para la expiraci\u00f3n del plazo de la Concesi\u00f3n, lo que fuere menor. En caso que la extinci\u00f3n se operare antes de finalizado el quinto ejercicio el lucro cesante indemnizable no ser\u00e1 superior a cinco (5) veces el promedio anual de las utilidades de la sociedad obtenidas durante el per\u00edodo que hubiere durado la Concesi\u00f3n.\"\n\n119.\n\nThe various procedures applicable to each type of termination of the Concession Contract are specified in Article 14.9 of the Concession Contract.\n\n120.\n\nChapter 15, the last chapter in the Concession Contract, concerned \"Final Provisions\" *(Disposiciones Finales').* Of note here is that the parties to the Contract agreed to submit any matter concerning the interpretation and application of the Concession Contract to the exclusive jurisdiction of federal administrative courts in the City of Buenos Aires.73\n\nArticle 15.4 of the Concession Contract. The original Spanish text of Article 15.4 reads as follows:  \n \"15.4 Jurisdicci\u00f3n  \n A los efectos de la interpretaci\u00f3n y aplicaci\u00f3n de este Contrato las partes se someten a la jurisdicci\u00f3n exclusiva de los tribunales en lo contencioso administrativo federal de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires.\"\n\n121.\n\n**Subsequent Revisions.** The legal framework of the Concession, as described in the preceding paragraphs, remained stable from the date that the Claimants assumed responsibility for the water and waste water system in Buenos Aires on 1 May 1993 until the Argentine crisis of 2001-2003. Throughout those more than seven years, the parties appeared to accept that framework as the basis of their relationship. During that time, in order to deal with changing circumstances, the parties agreed to a modification of the framework on two occasions - in 1994 and in 1999.\n\n122.\n\nIn 1994, ETOSS, the Regulatory Entity, undertook and approved an extraordinary tariff review, pursuant to the provisions of the Water Decree and the Concession Contract, that mandated certain additional investments by the Concessionaire not provided for in existing plans and at the same time permitted an increase in tariffs.74\n\nETOSS Resolution No. 81/94 of 30 June 1994 (Exh. H-6).\n\n123.\n\nIn 1997, the Argentine government by Decree No. 149/97 of 20 February 199775, formally opened a renegotiation process of the Concession Contract with AASA in order to address certain issues that had arisen since the Contract was signed, including the effect of new environmental laws, the adoption by Argentina of a treaty prohibiting maritime disposal of effluents, complaints against the infrastructure charge that AASA imposed in connecting new users to the system, and the need to develop a more efficient financial model for the Concession. The renegotiation process took place during the period 1997-1999 and as matters were decided upon they were approved by various decrees and resolutions.76 The renegotiation was formally closed by Decree No. 1,369/99 of 29 November 1999.77\n\nExh. C-53.\n\nSee Decree No. 1,167/97 of 20 November 1997, approving Agreement of 30 October 1997, in Exhibit C-56 of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial; Secretariat Resolutions No.1.103/98 of 29 January 1999, approving Agreement of 21 November 1998, in Exhibit C-60 of Claimants\u2019 Memorial; Secretariat Resolution No. 601/99 of 8 July 1999 (Exh. C-61); Secretariat Resolution No. 602/99 of 8 July 1999 (Exh. C-62); Secretariat Resolution No. 1,111/99 of 22 October 1999 (Exh. C-64).\n\nExh. C-65.\n\nC. *General Considerations*\n---------------------------\n\n124.\n\nViewed as a whole, the legal framework of the Concession sought to achieve and balance two basic objectives. First, it sought to attract private and foreign capital and know-how to the management and development of the Buenos Aires water and sewage systems, a sector that had previously been a governmental service exclusively. In order to attract the large amounts of capital needed, the framework had to assure private investors the opportunity to earn a reasonable profit. Given the fact that such investors would have to commit massive amounts of capital in the early years of the Concession and would only be repaid with an adequate return over a period of thirty years from the Concession\u2019s revenues, the tariff system was a key factor for enabling an investor to make a profit. An important element of the tariff system, in view of Argentina\u2019s volatile economic history, was the mechanism for revising the tariff to take account of changing circumstances during those thirty years. Thus, in order to attract the interest of investors, Argentina created a legal framework that assured investors the possibility of making a profit and of dealing with changes that might seriously affect the profitability of the enterprise. Argentina\u2019s conclusion of some fifty-seven bilateral investment treaties, three of which are applicable to these cases, sought to bolster its efforts at investment promotion by using international law to further assure foreign investors, like the Claimants, of their rights if they chose to invest in the country.\n\n125.\n\nA second important objective of the legal framework was to assure the efficient provision of water and sewage service at low cost. Toward this end, the legal framework gave the Argentine governmental authorities a certain degree of regulatory discretion in setting tariffs and in determining other important matters relating to AASA\u2019s activities. Although the Claimants assert that the tariff regime of the Water Decree was based on the \"Equilibrium Principle\" guaranteeing the Concessionaire a recovery of all costs plus a return on invested capital, it is important to note three features of the legal framework at this point: 1) the term \"Equilibrium Principle\" appears nowhere in the text of the Water Decree; 2) the Water Decree conditions tariffs on the attainment of service efficiency by the Concessionaire; and 3) the Concessionaire was to assume the business risks of the operation.\n\n126.\n\nMoreover, the Concession\u2019s legal framework did not contain certain elements that were found in Argentina\u2019s privatized concessions in other economic sectors. Thus, the legal framework to which AASA was subject 1) did not allow the payment or conversion of tariffs in US dollars or other convertible currencies; 2) did not provide for the adjustment of tariffs at fixed times according to an agreed upon index; and 3) did not specifically exempt the Concession from price controls.78 Moreover, instead of specifically mandating that the tariff was to provide for all costs and a reasonable return to the investor, Article 44 (d) of the Water Decree adopted a more flexible standard in stating, as noted above :\n\n\"The prices and tariffs shall *tend (tender\u00e1n)* to reflect the economic cost of the water and wastewater services, including a margin of profit for the Concessionaire and include all costs arising from the approved expansion plans.\" (emphasis added).\n\nOn the other hand, it is clear that the legal framework of the Concession sought to protect the Concessionaire from changes in the legal parity of the Argentine peso and from significant increase in costs. The operation and development of a water and sewage system in a large metropolitan area in a country that had experienced significant economic and financial difficulties in the past involved numerous risks. The Concession\u2019s legal framework sought to apportion those risks between the private investors and the Argentine State. That is to say, neither the Claimants nor Argentina alone assumed all of the risks that such an enterprise would face.\n\nSee, *e.g.* *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Decision on Liability (3 October 2006), for a discussion of the legal framework applicable to a gas transmission project.\n\n**V. The General Nature of the Claimants\u2019 Claims and Argentina\u2019s Defenses**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nIn submitting their cases to this Tribunal, the Claimants rely on specific treaty rights which they claim that Argentina has failed to respect. In effect, they allege that Argentina\u2019s treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investments violates three specific treaty provisions: 1) guarantees against direct and indirect expropriation of their investments; 2) guarantees to accord their investments full protection and security; and 3) guarantees to accord their investments fair and equitable treatment. In response, Argentina argues that none of its actions violate treaty provisions. Moreover, it advances two affirmative defenses based on international law: 1) that the defense of necessity under international law excuses any failure to satisfy its BIT commitments and 2) that the provisions in the Argentina-France BIT and the Argentina-United Kingdom on national emergencies pre-empt the application of other BIT provisions as a result of the situation arising out of the Argentine crisis and the measures taken by the government to address them. The Tribunal will next examine the nature and validity of the three alleged treaty violations, as well as Argentina\u2019s affirmative defenses under international law.\n\n**VI. Responsibility for Direct or Indirect Expropriation**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. *The Applicable Treaty Provisions*\n-------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nEach of the three BITs applicable to this case provide for the protection of investments by investors of one Contracting Party from acts of direct or indirect expropriation by the other Contracting Party in fairly similar terms.\n\nArticle 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT states:\n\n\"2. *The Contracting Parties shall not take, directly or indirectly, any expropriation or nationalization measures or any other measures having a similar effect of dispossession, except for reasons of public necessity and on condition that the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to a specific undertaking.*\n\n*Any such dispossession measures taken shall give rise to the payment of prompt and adequate compensation the amount of which, calculated in accordance with the real value of the investments in question, shall be assessed* *on the basis of the normal economic situation prior to any threat of dispossession. \"*\n\nArticle V of the Argentina-Spain BIT provides:\n\n*\"Nationalization and Expropriation*\n\n*Nationalization, expropriation, or any other measure having similar characteristics or effects that might be adopted by the authorities of one Party against investments made in its territory by investors of the other Party shall be effected only in the public interest, in accordance with the law, and shall in no case be discriminatory. The Party adopting such measures shall pay the investor or his assignee appropriate compensation, without undue delay, and in freely convertible currency. \"*\n\nAnd finally, Article 5(1) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT states:\n\nARTICLE 5 Expropriation\n\n*\"Investments of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \u2018expropriation) in the territory of the other Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Contracting Party on a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation.... \"*\n\n129.\n\nFor these provisions to apply to these cases and thus enable the Claimants to obtain compensation for the loss of their investments, this Tribunal must find, guided by the interpretation rules set forth in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, that such losses resulted from *\"measures \" (\"mesures \"* in French or *\"medidas \"* in Spanish) taken by Argentina that resulted in the expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment or had the effect of such expropriation. The application of the above-quoted treaty provisions therefore requires the existence of three elements: 1) an expropriable investment of a Claimant; 2) a measure taken by Argentina; and 3) an expropriation of that investment as a result of that measure.\n\n130.\n\nA first question then is whether the Claimants had an investment susceptible of expropriation under the three BITs applicable to these cases. In its Decision on Jurisdiction in these cases, this Tribunal held that the Claimants had made an investment for purposes of both Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the relevant provisions of the three applicable BITs.79 For the purpose of assessing the Claimants\u2019 expropriation claim, the Tribunal must now determine the specific assets allegedly expropriated. The Claimants, as shareholders in AASA, had an indirect interest in the Concession to operate the water and sewage system of Buenos Aires for a period of thirty years. Neither AASA nor its shareholders owned or had any legal interest in the physical assets of the system. Those assets, whether existing at the time of the granting of the Concession or constructed or introduced into the system thereafter, were the property of the Argentine State. AASA as holder of the Concession had only a legal right to receive a stream of revenue from the operation of the system for a period of time under the conditions specified in the legal framework of the Concession described above. That right owned by AASA falls within the treaty definition of \"investment\", which by the terms of the applicable BIT, includes \"claims and rights to any benefit having any economic value\" (Article 1.1(c) of the French Treaty), \"rights derived from any kind of contribution made with the intention of creating economic value\" (Article 1.2 of the Spanish Treaty), and \"claims to money which are directly related to a specific investment\" (Article 1 (a)(iii) of the U.K. Treaty). As shareholders in AASA, the Claimants had an indirect interest in those same rights. Company shares are considered \"investments\" under the Argentina-France BIT (Article 1 (b)), the Argentina-Spain BIT (Article 1(b)(2), and the Argentina-U.K. BIT (Article l(a)(ii)). The economic value of such shares would be directly affected by any action taken against the assets of AASA. Thus, the Claimants had investments capable of protection from expropriation.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2005, paras. 29 and 49.\n\n131.\n\nNone of the treaties applicable to these cases defines the noun \"measure.\"80 A dictionary definition of the term states that a measure is \"a plan or course of action taken to achieve a particular purpose.\"81 Thus, the various legislative, regulatory, and administrative actions taken by the Argentine authorities prior to, during, and following the country\u2019s financial crisis certainly qualify as \"measures.\" Such measures undoubtedly had an effect on the Concession. Many may have complicated and made difficult the Claimants\u2019 operation of the Concession and reduced the profitability of their investment. Others, such as Article 2 of Law No. 25,790 of 1 October 2003, which among other things directed that decisions of the executive branch not be limited by the regulatory framework of the Concession, may have abrogated or limited AASA\u2019s and the Claimants\u2019 rights under Argentine law. But whether any or all of such measures constitute expropriation or have the effect of expropriation is quite a different matter. It is that question that this tribunal must address.\n\nCompare section 201 of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which states that **\"measure** includes any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice.\"\n\nOxford English Dictionary.\n\n132.\n\nThe treaty provisions quoted above cover both direct expropriations and indirect expropriation. In the former situation, a host government uses its sovereign powers to seize assets by depriving an investor of its title to or control over those assets. In case of an indirect expropriation, sometimes referred to as a \"regulatory taking,\"82 host states invoke their legislative and regulatory powers to enact measures that reduce the benefits investors derive from their investments but without actually changing or canceling investors\u2019 legal title to their assets or diminishing their control over them.83 While determining the existence of a direct expropriation is usually not difficult because of the usually obvious physical manifestations that come with depriving an investor of title and control, identifying an indirect expropriation is often a much more complicated matter which requires an inquiry into whether a regulatory measure has the effect of an expropriation on an investment or is a valid exercise of a State\u2019s regulatory power. As the tribunal in the NAFTA case of *Feldman v. Mexico* acknowledged, recognizing a direct expropriation is not difficult but \u2018... it is much less clear when governmental action that interferes with broadly-defined property rights... crosses the line from valid regulation to a compensable taking, and it is fair to say that no one has come up with a fully satisfactory means of drawing this line.\u201984 As will be seen below, the Claimants assert that Argentina took both direct and indirect expropriatory measures.\n\nS.R. Ratner, *Regulatory Takings in Institutional Context: Beyond the Fear of Fragmented International Law,* 102 AJIL 475 (2008).\n\nSee *e.g.* R Dolzer & Ch Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (2007) 89-92; A. Reinisch, *Expropriation* in P. Muchlinski et al.(eds) The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law (2008) 407-412.\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1); Award (16 December 2002), at para. 100.\n\n133.\n\nAn initial problem in applying the above-quoted treaty provisions to these cases is that none of the three BITs specifically define the term \"expropriation.\" However, Article 5(2) of the Argentina-France BIT, quoted above, provides some elaboration of the term when it refers to \"...similar acts of dispossession...\" and \"...such dispossession measures...\" Thus, expropriation, at least in the Argentina-France BIT, requires a \"dispossession\" of the investor. The requirement of \"dispossession\" as an element of expropriation is supported by scholars and jurisprudence in previous cases in which tribunals had to determine whether an expropriation had taken place. That inquiry is directed particularly at the \"effects\" of the measure on an investment, rather than at the intent of the government enacting the measure. Each of the BIT articles quoted above specifically refers to the \"effects\" of an expropriation measure and thus affirms the importance of evaluating the effects of a measure on the investment in determining whether an expropriation has taken place.\n\n134.\n\nInternational tribunals treat the severity of the economic impact caused by a regulatory measure as an important element in determining if the measure constitutes an expropriation requiring compensation. One question often asked is whether the challenged governmental measure resulted in \"substantial deprivation\" of the investment or its economic benefits. Thus, the tribunal in *Occidental v. Ecuador*85 applied \"the criterion of substantial deprivation\" in determining whether the imposition of an Ecuadorian tax constituted an indirect expropriation. In *CMS* v. *Argentina,*86 which also relates to the Argentine crisis of 2001-2003, the claimant, an investor in a gas transportation company, alleged that Argentina\u2019s decision to suspend a tariff adjustment formula for gas transportation during the crisis constituted an indirect expropriation. In evaluating this claim, the tribunal, after reviewing the relevant arbitral jurisprudence, stated that \u2018the essential question is to establish whether the enjoyment of the property has been effectively neutralized,\u2019 because \u2018the standard where indirect expropriation is contended is that of *substantial deprivation!* (emphasis added) Moreover, such deprivation must have permanent or lasting results. For example, in *LG&E v. Argentina,* the tribunal found that the effects of Argentina\u2019s measures on the claimants\u2019 investment were not permanent, stating that such measures could not constitute expropriation \"without a permanent, severe deprivation of LG&E\u2019s rights with regard to its investment, or almost complete deprivation of the value of LG&E\u2019s investment.\"87 Thus, in applying the provisions of the three BITs applicable to these cases, this Tribunal will have to determine whether they effected a substantial, permanent deprivation of the Claimants\u2019 investments or the enjoyment of those investments\u2019 economic benefits.\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. the Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case No UN3467 (Final Award) (1 July 2004), at para. 89.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. the Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No ARB/01/8) (Award) (12 May 2005), at para. 262.\n\n*LG&E supra* note 78 at para. 200.\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimants in their pleadings complained against Argentina\u2019s \"Measures,\" referring collectively to numerous actions taken by Argentina from the time that the crisis began to emerge in 1999 until the Concession was terminated in 2006. In order to evaluate the expropriatory nature of these numerous measures, the Tribunal must examine them individually. Basically, the measures of which the Claimants complain fall into three categories: 1) acts of a general legal or regulatory nature, not directed specifically at AASA or the Claimants, enacted to cope with the financial crisis and its aftermath; 2) the failure of the Argentine government in response to AASA\u2019s repeated requests to revise the tariff charged to users by the Concession during and after the crisis; and 3) the actions taken by the Argentine government at the time of the termination of the Concession. The Tribunal will examine the nature of these three categories of measures to determine whether they constituted measures of expropriation under the applicable BITs.\n\nB. *Argentina\u2019s Measures to cope with the Crisis.*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nBeginning in 2001, the Argentine government enacted various measures in an effort to cope with the financial crisis descending on the country. Among these measures of which the Claimants complain are Decree No 1570/01 of 3 December 2001 which imposed a \"corra/fto\" or \"little fence\" upon bank accounts so as to limit the amounts of cash withdrawals by account holders, the imposition of new taxes, and most of all Emergency Law88 No. 25, 561 of 6 January 2002, which i) abolished the currency board that had linked the Argentine Peso to the U.S. dollar, resulting in a significant depreciation of the Argentine Peso; ii) abolished the adjustment of public service contracts according to agreed upon indexations; and iii) authorized the Executive branch of government to renegotiate all public service contracts and led to various other measures surrounding the efforts by the Argentine government to renegotiate public service contracts. These measures certainly made the operation of the Concession more difficult, reduced its profitability significantly, and appear to have abrogated or modified certain acquired rights of the Claimants. However, they did not affect the possession by AASA of the Concession. AASA remained in possession of the Concession through this period and continued to provide water and sewage services to Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities. Moreover, the Claimants as AASA shareholders continued to control AASA and to retain possession of their AASA shares undisturbed. Thus, the Tribunal finds that no overt taking of the Concession\u2019s rights during this period occurred as a result of these measures and therefore no direct expropriation, as that term is understood under the BITs and in international law, took place.\n\n*Supra* note 28.\n\n137.\n\nDid these measures constitute an indirect expropriation or a measure tantamount to expropriation? The fact that the effect of such measures may have diminished the value of an investment does not in and of itself constitute an indirect expropriation. In *LG&E89* which considered the effect on investors in the gas sector of the measures that Argentina took to deal with the crisis, the tribunal found that such measures did not constitute either a direct or an indirect expropriation under the Argentina-U.S. BIT. Citing *CME Czech Republic B. V. v. Czech Republic,* the **LG&E** tribunal stated that a measure tantamount to expropriation occurs when governmental measures \"effectively neutralize[d] the benefit of the property of the foreign owner.\" It then stated: \"Ownership or enjoyment can be said to be \"neutralized \"where a party no longer is in control of the investment or where it cannot direct the day-to-day operations of the investment.\"90 The **LG&E** tribunal ultimately found that no expropriation, direct or indirect, had taken place as a result of the measures taken by Argentina. Similarly in *CMS,* noted above, although the tribunal recognized that the measures under dispute had an important effect on the investor\u2019s business, it found no substantial deprivation and thus no breach of the expropriation provision of the Argentina-US BIT. It also pointed out that \"the investor is in control of the investment; the government does not manage the day-to-day operations of the company... and the investor has full ownership and control of the investment.\"91 The same can be said of the Claimants in the present cases with respect to the measures taken by Argentina to cope with the crisis. The events surrounding the termination of the AASA Concession are a different matter that will be discussed below.\n\n*LG&E supra* note 78, Award (25 July 2007).\n\n*Ibid.,* at para. 188. Citing *Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Canada,* Interim Award (26 June 2000), at para. 100.\n\n*CMS supra* note 86 at para. 263.\n\n138.\n\nClaimants in several other investor-State arbitrations arising out of the 2001-2003 crisis have alleged that Argentina\u2019s measures to deal with the crisis constituted acts of indirect expropriation. In nearly all of those cases, the tribunals rejected that claim on the grounds that those measures did not amount to a permanent, substantial deprivation of the economic substance of the investment.92 In only one case, *Siemens v. Argentina**93* did a tribunal find that Argentina\u2019s actions constituted expropriation. In that case, the tribunal did not find that general measures enacted by Argentina to deal with the crisis were expropriations but rather that a specific government decree terminating Siemens\u2019 contract with the Argentine government was an expropriation.\n\n*LG&E supra* note 78; *CMS supra* note 86; *Azurix Corp* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Award (14 July 2006); *Enron Corp, and Ponderosa Assets S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID case No. ARB/01/3), Award, (22 May 2007).\n\n*Siemens AG v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8), Award (6 February 2007).\n\n139.\n\nAs numerous cases have pointed out, in evaluating a claim of expropriation it is important to recognize a State\u2019s legitimate right to regulate and to exercise its police power in the interests of public welfare and not to confuse measures of that nature with expropriation. The *American Law Institute\u2019s Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States* underscores this point when it states that \"... a State is not responsible for loss of property or for other economic disadvantage resulting from *bona fide* general taxation, regulation, forfeiture for crime, or other action that is commonly accepted as within the police power of States, if it is not discriminatory...\"94 In the context of investment disputes, the doctrine of police powers has been referred to, for instance, in *Methanex v. United States95* and *Saluka v. the Czech Republic96* In this latter decision, the tribunal noted that \"the principle that a State does not commit an expropriation and is thus not liable to pay compensation to a dispossessed alien investor when it adopts general regulations that are 'commonly accepted as within the police power of States\u2019 forms part of customary law today.\"\n\nAmerican Law Institute, Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, Vol. 1, sec. 712, comment g.\n\n*Methanex Co. v.

V. v. the Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL), Partial Award (17 March 2006), at para. 262.\n\n140.\n\nIn analyzing the measures taken by Argentina to cope with the crisis, the Tribunal finds that, given the nature of the severe crisis facing the country, those general measures were within the general police powers of the Argentine State, and they did not constitute a permanent and substantial deprivation of the Claimants\u2019 investments. Although they may have negatively affected the profitability of the AASA Concession, they did not take or reduce the property rights of AASA or its investors and did not affect the ability of AASA to hold the Concession and to direct its operations and activities. The Tribunal therefore concludes that such measures did not violate the above quoted BIT articles with respect to direct or indirect expropriation; however, that is not to say that they have not violated other treaty commitments.\n\nC. *Argentina's Refusal to Revise the Tariff*\n---------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that Argentina's failure to revise the tariff in response to AASA\u2019s repeated requests constitutes direct or indirect expropriation. In making a literal interpretation of the BITs, one encounters an initial question with respect to the Claimants' assertion. All three treaties require the existence of a governmental \"measure\" in order to found a claim for expropriation. Can a *failure* to take action, such as to revise a tariff, constitute a \"measure\"? In *Olguin v. Paraguay,* the tribunal expressed the opinion that \"[e]xpropriation therefore requires a teleologically driven action for it to occur; omissions, however egregious they may be, are not sufficient for it to take place.\"97 A \"measure,\" which is not defined in any of the three BITs, is usually interpreted to mean an action taken to achieve a particular purpose. In this case, although Argentina refused to revise the tariff that action of refusal was not an omission but the result of a carefully considered decision formally communicated to AASA and that decision constitutes a measure within the meaning of all three treaties. The decision not to revise the tariff in response to AASA\u2019s requests was certainly teleologically driven.\n\n*Eudoro A. Olguin* v. *Republic of Paraguay* (ICSID Case No ARB 96/5), Award, (26 January 2001), at para. 84.\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Argentina's failure to revise the tariff according to the terms of the legal framework deprived them of the economic benefit of their investment and therefore constituted an indirect expropriation. The economic value of the investment was the tariff income that AASA was to receive from payments by consumers for water and sewage services. That income according to the legal framework described above was dependent on the tariff which was in turn to be determined in such a way as to allow AASA to earn a profit on its operations. The Concession, according to the Claimants, was based on the principle of financial equilibrium, the principle that the applicable tariff would be set at a level to assure that the income from consumer payments would cover all costs of operation, including debt service, and provide AASA a reasonable profit. By refusing to apply the legal framework to revise the tariff in the presence of steeply rising costs, the Argentine authorities' measures prevented AASA from achieving the required financial equilibrium and therefore destroyed the economic value of the Concession, resulting in an indirect expropriation.\n\n143.\n\nArgentina denies that its refusal to revise the tariff was a measure of expropriation or constituted a regulatory taking. It argues that it was not obligated to increase the tariff under the legal framework of the Concession, that the principle of financial equilibrium was not embodied in the Concession, that AASA, as concessionaire, had assumed certain risks incident to the operation of the Concession which Argentina, as the conceding authority, was not obligated to protect AASA against. It points to the fact that its refusal to revise the tariff did not result in a taking necessary for an expropriation and that any complaints by AASA concerning the application of the tariff regime were in effect contract claims to be settled according to the dispute resolution mechanism of the Concession, not treaty claims to be resolved in international arbitration.\n\n144.\n\nIn support of its expropriation claims arising out of Argentina\u2019s exercise of its regulatory powers or failure thereof, the Claimants rely particularly on the cases of *CME* and *Vivendi II.* In both of those cases, the Claimants had lost their investments as a result of State measures, and the tribunals in both cases found that expropriations had taken place. With respect to the former case, the present Tribunal notes that *Lauder v. Czech Re public98* which the Claimants did not discuss in their pleadings, dealt with identical facts to those of the *CME case* and a similar BIT, but concluded that the Czech government\u2019s measures in that case did not constitute an expropriation, thus significantly diminishing the precedential value of *CME.* Moreover, in *CME,* the challenged Czech government action was an affirmative action by the government whereas in the present cases the Claimants are complaining of Argentina\u2019s failure to exercise its regulatory powers affirmatively in favor of AASA. With respect to *Vivendi II,* which did not arise out of the Argentine crisis of 2001-2003, the provincial government undertook a series of deliberate actions, such as forbidding the collection of unpaid waters and sewage bills in the courts, which had the effect of depriving the concessionaire of the means of enforcing legitimate monetary claims necessary for the economic viability of its enterprise. In the present case, the governmental authorities took no such similar actions against AASA or the Claimants.\n\n*Ronald S. Lauder v. the Czech Republic* (UNCITRAL), Final Award, (3 September 2001).\n\n145.\n\nAn indirect expropriation requires a substantial deprivation of an investment. No such substantial deprivation occurred as a result of Argentina\u2019s refusal to revise the tariffs to be applied by AASA. Throughout the period 1999-2006, AASA remained in control of the Concession and its authority to manage and direct the operation of the water and sewage system was undiminished. The Tribunal therefore concludes that Argentina\u2019s failure to revise the tariff, despite AASA\u2019s repeated requests during this period, did not constitute either a direct or indirect expropriation of the Claimants\u2019 investment in AASA.\n\nD. *Argentina\u2019s Termination of the Concession*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n146.\n\nOn March 21, 2006, Argentina abruptly took measures to terminate the Concession granted to AASA in 1993 and to retake possession of the water distribution and waste water systems that had been the subject of the Concession. Moreover, Argentina also liquidated the performance bond which AASA and the Claimants had established to guarantee their performance under the Concession. Did such measures constitute either a direct or indirect expropriation of the Concession?\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimants assert that such measures which resulted in a complete deprivation of AASA\u2019s rights in the Concession constituted a clear case of not just an indirect expropriation but also a direct expropriation. They argue that such termination makes their situation different from the situations that prevailed in *CMS v. Argentina, LG&E v. Argentina, Azurix v. Argentina,* and the other cases cited above in which tribunals deciding cases arising out of the Argentine crisis determined that the measures taken by Argentina to cope with the crisis did not constitute either a direct or indirect expropriation. The key difference, according to the Claimants, was that in those cases, the investors remained in ownership and control of their investments but that the Claimants in the present case, because of Argentina\u2019s abrupt termination of the Concession, did not. As a result of the termination, the Claimants assert that Argentina gained a much improved and expanded water and sewage system without having to pay compensation for it. In support of their position, the Claimants cite the cases of *CME*99 and *Vivendi II*100 In both of those cases, the Claimants had lost their investments as a result of State measures and the tribunals in both cases found that expropriations had taken place.\n\n*CME Czech Republic BV (The Netherlands) v. the Czech Republic,* (UNCITRAL), Partial Award, (13 September 2001).\n\n*Supra* note 10, Award (20 August 2007).\n\n148.\n\nIn order to determine whether an expropriation has taken place as a result of Argentina\u2019s termination of the Concession, the Tribunal must examine and analyze the rights held by AASA in the Concession. Neither AASA nor its shareholders owned or had any property rights in the physical assets of the water and sewage system of Buenos Aires. Had they owned the system, a seizure of that system by the Argentine government would have constituted an expropriation and the Claimants would have been entitled to protection under the expropriation provisions of the BITs applicable to these cases. Instead, AASA held contractual rights as a Concessionaire to operate that system and to derive income from that operation. That Concession gave AASA certain rights, which included the right to collect revenues generated by tariffs paid by consumers during a period of thirty years. But AASA\u2019s rights to that revenue and to continue to operate the water and sewage system of Buenos Aires were by no means absolute, as the Claimants seem to suggest in their pleadings. Those rights were subject to various conditions concerning such matters as efficiency, adequacy of service, and achievement of investment commitments for improvement and expansion of the system, among others. Moreover, as discussed above, the Concession Contract specifically granted the Argentine government the right to terminate the Concession due to the fault of the Concessionaire and to retake possession of the water and sewage system.\n\n149.\n\nIn September 2005, AASA itself had sought to abandon the Concession. Argentina denied that request. AASA\u2019s request placed a certain pressure on Argentina to plan for the eventuality of AASA\u2019s unilateral withdrawal. Subsequently, faced with a deteriorating situation and confronted with the overwhelming need and public duty to assure the continued provision of water and waste water services to millions of people in a vast urban area, the Argentine government invoked its rights under the Concession Contract and terminated the Concession, alleging various deficiencies of the Concessionaire, in particular excessive levels of nitrates in the water being delivered by the Concessionaire. Argentina argues that under the Concession Contract it had the right to terminate the Concession for serious fault and that alleged high levels of nitrates constituted such a serious fault. During the attempt to renegotiate the Concession Contract, the Argentine regulatory authorities had also imposed various high fines on AASA for certain deficiencies in operation.\n\n150.\n\nIn response, the Claimants assert that Argentina\u2019s claim of high nitrate levels is untrue and a mere pretext to allow termination of the Concession for other reasons and that the fines were essentially a pressure tactic used by the Argentine government to secure AASA\u2019s agreement to unjustified new Concession terms.\n\n151.\n\nInternational law has recognized that contractual rights may be the subject of expropriation at least since the *Norwegian Shipowners\u2019 Claims case.101* The *Chorzow Factory* case would come to a similar conclusion.102 Although the three treaties applicable to the present cases do not specifically so state, the inference is clear from the fact that their definitions of investments include concessions conferred by law or contract that contractual rights in a concession, like rights in physical assets, are protected from expropriation. But just as in a case of the expropriation of physical assets, a tribunal must first understand the nature of the rights allegedly expropriated before proceeding to determine whether they have been expropriated under international law. To assess the nature of these rights, in a case of alleged expropriation of contractual rights one must look to the domestic law under which the rights were created. AASA\u2019s and the Claimants\u2019 contractual rights in the Concession, which the Claimants allege were expropriated, were created by the legal framework and the Concession Contract described above.\n\n*Norwegian Shipowners\u2019 Claims (Nor v U.S.),* (Perm Ct Arb 1922) 1 RIAA 307.\n\n*Case Concerning the Factory at Chorzow (FRG v. Pol)* (1927) PCIJ Series A No 9.\n\n152.\n\nUnder that legal framework, Argentina had a right to terminate the Concession Contract upon certain conditions, mentioned above. In January 2006, it purported to exercise its contractual rights when it terminated the Concession with AASA. In this regard, the situation was different from that existing in *the Norwegian Shipowners Claims Case,* the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case,* and the *CME* v. *Czech Republic* *Case,* on which the Claimants rely. In those cases, the respondent State was interfering in a contract between the claimants and a third party. In the present case, the Respondent was taking action with respect to a contract to which it was a party and whose terms gave it a right to terminate under certain conditions. The Tribunal also notes that *Lauder v. Czech Republic**103* which the Claimants did not discuss in their pleadings, dealt with identical facts to those of the *CME case* and a similar BIT, but which concluded that the Czech government\u2019s measures in that case did not constitute an expropriation.\n\n*Supra* note 98.\n\n153.\n\nIn investor-State arbitrations which involve breaches of contracts concluded between a claimant and a host government, tribunals have made a distinction between *acta iure imperii* and *acta iure gestionis,* that is to say, actions by a State in exercise of its sovereign powers and actions of a State as a contracting party. It is the use by a State of its sovereign powers that gives rise to treaty breaches, while actions as a contracting party merely give rise to contract claims not ordinarily covered by an investment treaty. As pointed out in *Siemens v. Argentina,* \"... for the behavior of the State as a party to a contract to be considered a breach of an investment treaty, such behavior must be beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt and involve State interference with the operation of the contract.\"104 In *Siemens,* the tribunal found that Argentina took a series of measures based not on its contract with the Siemens subsidiary but on the exercise of its public authority, one of which was a governmental decree not based on contract but which terminated the contract. It therefore found that Argentina had expropriated Siemens\u2019 contractual rights. A similar finding was reached in *Vivendi II,* where the tribunal concluded that the measures taken by the Province of Tucum\u00e1n amounted to an expropriation of the investor\u2019s contractual rights.105 However, the mere fact that there is some government involvement in the events that lead to the termination of a contract does not necessarily mean that such termination is the result of an exercise of sovereign powers, as noted recently by the tribunal in *Bayindir v. Pakistan.**106*\n\n*Supra* note 93, at para. 248.\n\n*Supra* note 10, Award (20 August 2007), at para. 7.5.34.\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret ve Sanayi A \u015e v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/29), (hereafter *\"Bayindir v. Pakistan \")* Award (27 August 2009), at paras. 128-129, 315.\n\n154.\n\nIn the present cases, did Argentina act in the exercise of its sovereign powers *(acta iure imperii)* or as an ordinary contracting party *(acta iure gestionis)* when it terminated the Concession Contract with AASA? If the former, then Argentina may have expropriated the contractual rights of AASA and the Claimants. If the latter, then no expropriation has taken place and the Claimants have only contractual claims under the legal framework described above. While Argentina exercised its public authority on various occasions during the crisis, the Tribunal does not consider that its termination of the Concession Contract was an exercise of such authority. Rather, its actions were taken according to the rights it claimed under the Concession Contract and the legal framework. Indeed, Argentina\u2019s behavior in ending the Concession Contract seems not unlike the behavior of a private contracting party faced with the threatened termination of an important long-term supply contract: it quickly made other provisions for supply of the needed commodity or service and then took steps to end the deteriorated contractual relationship itself.\n\n155.\n\nThis Tribunal views the dispute between the Claimants and Argentina concerning the termination of the Concession as essentially contractual in nature. Indeed, Argentina\u2019s action in terminating the Concession purportedly in accordance with the Concession\u2019s terms was not an act of expropriation but rather the exercise of its alleged contractual rights. Even its liquidation of the Performance Bond was based on an alleged contractual right since Argentina was the beneficiary of that bond. Whether such alleged exercise of contractual rights was legally in accord with the Concession Contract and the Performance Bond is a matter for the dispute settlement processes applicable to that Contract and the Performance Bond. The Tribunal does not ignore that, under certain circumstances, the unlawful exercise of a contractual remedy may support the conclusion that there has been a treaty breach. As noted in an award recently rendered by another ICSID tribunal:\n\n\"[...] in assessing whether there has been a treaty breach a tribunal may review contract matters [... ] These considerations do not imply that the assessment of a treaty breach in the context of a contractual relationship requires a determination that the contract has been breached. Breach of contract and breach of treaty are separate questions giving rise to separate enquiries [... ] Because the enquiries are different, the fact that a State exercises a contract right or remedy does not in and of itself exclude the possibility of a treaty breach.\"107\n\n*Id,* par. 136-138.\n\n156.\n\nIn its assessment of the existence of a treaty breach, the Tribunal has taken into account, insofar as relevant, the contractual conduct of Argentina. It concludes, however, that measures taken by Argentina to terminate the Concession were ostensibly an exercise of its contractual rights but not measures of expropriation. Therefore, irrespective of the conclusions that the dispute settlement processes applicable to the Concession Contract and the Performance Bond may yield, the Tribunal concludes that Argentina\u2019s conduct in this regard was not in breach of the expropriation clauses of the BITs.\n\nE. *The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions*\n-------------------------------\n\n157.\n\nAfter examining the various measures taken by Argentina from the onset of the crisis in 1999 until the termination of the Concession in 2006, the Tribunal concludes that none of them, either individually or collectively, violated the BIT provisions governing direct and indirect expropriations.\n\n**VII. Responsibility for Failure to Provide Protection and Security**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. *The Applicable Treaty Provisions*\n-------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that Argentina has breached the provisions of the BITs in that they have denied the Claimants protection and security. The specific treaty provision on which they rely are as follows: Article 5(1) of the Argentina-France BIT states:\n\n*Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party shall be fully and completely protected and safeguarded in the territory and maritime zone of the other Contracting Party, in accordance with the principle of just and equitable treatment mentioned in article 3 of this Agreement.*\n\nArticle III. 1 of the Argentina-Spain BIT provides:\n\n*Article III PROTECTION*\n\n*Each Party shall protect within its territory investments made in accordance with its legislation by investors of the other Party and shall not obstruct, by unjustified or discriminatory measures, the management, use, enjoyment, extension, sale and, where appropriate, liquidation of such investments.*\n\nAnd finally, Article 2(2), entitled \"Promotion and Protection of Investment\" of the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT states:\n\n*Investments of Investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy protection and constant security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use enjoyment or disposal of investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.*\n\n159.\n\nAt the outset, it should be noted that whereas the Claimants\u2019 pleadings refer to these treaty provisions as guaranteeing \"full protection and security,\" a term found in many bilateral investment treaties, that specific phrase appears nowhere in the three BITs applicable to these cases. The Argentina-France BIT promises that investments will be \"fully and completely protected and safeguarded...\"; the Argentina-Spain BIT promises only that the Contracting Parties \"shall protect\" investments; and the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT promises \"protection and constant security.\" It remains to be seen whether these three BITs are in effect promising differing levels of protection and whether the level of protection they provide is different from that offered by the many treaties employing the terminology of \"full protection and security\".\n\nB. *Analysis and Jurisprudence*\n-------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nIn seeking to apply these provisions, this Tribunal is confronted initially with two basic questions: Protection from whom? Protection against what? In other words, from whom is a Contracting Party to protect an investor and against what specific actions by such person is a Contracting Party to secure protection? The Claimants argue that in withdrawing certain alleged guarantees made to the Concessionaire and its investors Argentina withdrew \"...the legal protection and security previously granted to an investment...\".108 Thus, Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the above-quoted treaty provisions is that Argentina promised to protect the investments of the other Contracting Party from actions that Argentina itself might take in the exercise of its legal and regulatory authority. The Respondent, on the other hand, takes the position that the provisions on protection and security apply primarily to protection from physical acts against an investor or investment and that only in exceptional circumstances should they be applied to other situations.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Submission, para. 361.\n\n161.\n\nThe origin of the terms \"full protection and security\", \"constant protection and security,\" or simply \"protection and security\" appears to lie in the bilateral commercial treaties that countries concluded in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, such as the friendship, commerce and navigation (FCN) treaties made by the United States during that period.109 For example, of twenty-two early commercial treaties concluded by the United States before 1920, fourteen contained reference to \"special protection\" and the remaining eight specified \"full and perfect protection\" of persons\u2019 private property.110 As an illustration, Article 3 the FCN treaty that the United States concluded with Brunei in 1850 provided that His Highness the Sultan of Borneo \"...engages that such Citizens of the United States of America shall as far as lies within in his power, within his dominions enjoy *full and complete protection and security* for themselves and for any property which they may acquire...\" (emphasis added).111 A number of bilateral treaties of other countries also employed this term.112\n\nK. Vandevelde, *\"The Bilateral Investment Treaty Program of the United States, \"* 21 Cornell Int\u2019l L.J. 203, 204. (1988).\n\nW. Wilson, R., *\"Property-protection Provisions in United States Commercial Treaties, \"* 45 Am. J. Int\u2019l L. 84, 92-96(1951).\n\nTreaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation with Brunei, 10 Stat. 909; Treaty Series 331 (entered into force July 11, 1853).\n\nSee for example the bilateral treaty between Italy and Venezuela, stating that \"citizens of each State should enjoy in the territory of the other \u2018the fullest measure of protection and security of person and property, and should have in this respect the same rights and privileges accorded to nationals. \u2019 Quoted in the *Sambiaggio* case, Italy-Venezuela Mixed Claims Commission, U.N. Reports of International Arbitral Awards, vol.X, p. 512.\n\n162.\n\nTraditionally, courts and tribunals have interpreted the content of this standard of treatment as imposing a positive obligation upon a host State to exercise due diligence to protect the investor and his property from physical threats and injuries, not as imposing an obligation to protect covered investments and investors from all injuries from whatever sources. In the *ELSI case,113* in which the United States brought a claim against Italy on grounds that the requisition of a U.S. investor\u2019s factory by the Mayor of Palermo, Italy, violated Article V(l) of the United States-Italy FCN treaty obligating the Contracting Parties to provide investors \"the most constant protection and security,\" the International Court of Justice Chamber stated that: \"The reference in Article V to the provision of \u2018constant protection and security\u2019 cannot be construed as the giving of a warranty that property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or disturbed.\"114\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI),* (U.S. v. Italy), I.C.J. Reports 1989.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00a7 108, p.65.\n\n163.\n\nWith the development of bilateral investment treaties, whose texts were influenced by the language of the earlier of FCN treaties, the drafters of BITs incorporated the term \"full protection and security,\" or some variation thereof, in this new legal instrument designed to protect and promote foreign investment in a new era. Early interpretations of BIT provisions on full protection and security applied them essentially to protect investors and investments from physical injuries and threats, particularly from actions, usually unauthorized, by a country\u2019s army units or individual soldiers, or from disgruntled workers.115 In each of these cases, the tribunals stressed that the treaty provision was not a guarantee against all injuries that might befall an investment but only required the host country to exercise due diligence. On the meaning of due diligence, tribunals and scholars have often referred to the statement of Professor A.V. Freeman in his lectures at the Hague Academy of International Law: \"The \u2018due diligence\u2019 is nothing more nor less than the reasonable measures of prevention which a well-administered government could be expected to exercise under similar circumstances.\"116 The late Professor Ian Brownlie observed that the decisions of tribunals give no definition of \u2018due diligence\u2019, but that \u2018obviously no very dogmatic definition would be appropriate, since what is involved is a standard which will vary according to the circumstances.\u2019117\n\nSee *e.g.,* Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Sri Lanka (ICSID Case No. ARB/ 87/3) Award (27 June 1990); *American Manufacturing and Trading, Inc. v. Zaire* (ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1) Award (21 February 1997).\n\nAV Freeman, *Responsibility of States for the Unlawful Acts of Their Armed Forces',* 88 Recueil des Cours (1956) 261.\n\nI. Brownlie, *Principles of Public International Law* (1990) 454.\n\n164.\n\nThe fact that the \"full protection and security\" standard implies only an obligation of due diligence, as opposed to strict liability, has also been widely recognized in more recent arbitral case decisions.118 On the other hand, there seems to exist no consensus as to the extent to which the full protection and security standard may exceed the State\u2019s obligation to provide mere physical security to the investor and his assets.\n\nSee, among others, *Saluka supra* note 96; at para. 483; *Rumeli Telekom A.S and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S v. Republic of Kazakhstan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16) Award (29 July 2008), at para. 668; *Waguih Elie George Siag & Clorinda Vecchi v. the Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/15), Award (1 June 2009), at para.447.\n\n165.\n\nTraditionally, the cases applying full protection and security have dealt with injuries to physical assets of investors committed by third parties where host governments have failed to exercise due diligence in preventing the damage or punishing the perpetrators. In the present case, the Claimants are attempting to apply the protection and security clause to a different type of situation. They do not complain that third parties have injured their physical assets or persons, as in the traditional protection and security case. They are instead asserting that Argentina denied it protection and security by dint of the actions which Argentina itself took in exercise of its governmental powers against AASA\u2019s contractual rights under the Concession Contract and the governing legal framework. This Tribunal must therefore decide whether the treaty provisions apply to the Claimants\u2019 situation.\n\n166.\n\nIn recent years, a few arbitral tribunals have sought to expand the scope and content of the \"full protection and security\" clause beyond protection from physical injury, and have interpreted it to apply to unjustified administrative and legal actions taken by a government or its subdivisions that injured an investment\u2019s alleged legal rights. It is on these decisions that the Claimants rely, particularly *CME v. the Czech Republic119* and *Azurix Corp. v. Argentina.120* For example, in *CME,* which Claimants cite in support of their argument, the tribunal stated: \"The host State is obligated to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor\u2019s investment withdrawn or devalued.\"121\n\n*Supra* note 99.\n\n*Supra* note 92.\n\n*Supra* note 100 at para. 613.\n\n167.\n\nHowever, the precedential effect of the **CME** case might be reduced by the fact it was not a unanimous decision, and that the tribunal did not conduct a detailed analysis of this particular point. Furthermore, as is well known, the tribunal in the *Lauder* case, which was very closely related to the **CME** case, reached a diametrically different conclusion. With respect to the application of the full protection and security clause in the U.S.-Czech BIT, the tribunal in *Lauder* held that \"... none of the facts alleged by the Claimants constitutes a violation by the Respondent of the obligation to provide full protection and security under the Treaty.\"122\n\n*Supra* note 99, at para.309.\n\n168.\n\nThe *CME* tribunal was interpreting Article 3(2) of the Netherlands-Czech Republic BIT, stipulating that \"each Contracting Party shall provide to such investments full security and protection\" (emphasis added). That treaty formulation is somewhat different from the BIT provisions applicable to the present case. Notably the Argentina-Spain and Argentina-U.K. BITs refer only to \"protection\" and to \"protect\" without the qualifying word \"full\" or \"fully,\" while the Argentina-France BITs states that investors shall be \"fully protected.\" Does the difference in formulation affect the scope of protection afforded by the BITs? The tribunal in *Azurix Corp. v. Argentina* implied that it did, for it justified on that basis a finding that the Argentina-United States BIT providing for \"full protection and security\" applied to measures taken by a government and was not limited to physical actions. It stated: \"However when the terms 'protection and security' are qualified by full and no other adjective or explanation, they extend, in their ordinary meaning, the content of this standard beyond physical security.\"123 Thus, *Azurix* seemed to suggest that the omission of \"full\" or \"fully,\" as is the case with two of the applicable BITs in the present cases, restricted the scope of protection only to physical security and protection. The tribunal in *Biwater* adhered to the same line of argument and noted that full protection and security \"implies a State\u2019s guarantee of stability in a secure environment, both physical, commercial and legal. It would in the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view be unduly artificial to confine the notion of \"full security\" only to one aspect of security, particularly in light of the use of this term in a BIT, directed at the protection of commercial and financial investments.\"124\n\n*Supra* note 92, at para. 408.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22), Award, (24 July 2008), at para. 729.\n\n169.\n\nOther tribunals have given less weight to the precise language used in the treaty when determining the scope of the full protection and security standard. For example, in *Parkerings v. Lithuania125* the tribunal found that: \"It is generally accepted that the variation of language between the formulation \u2018protection\u2019 and \u2018full protection and security\u2019 does not make a difference in the level of protection a State is to provide.\"126\n\n*Parkerings-Compangiet AS v. the Republic of Lithuania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/08), Award (August 14, 2007).\n\nPara. 354, citing Rubins N., Kinsella S., *International Investment, Political Risk and Dispute Resolution* (2005) to justify this proposition.\n\n170.\n\nWith regard to the third treaty in the present cases, the Argentina-France BIT requires that investors are to be \"... fully and completely protected...in accordance with the principle of just and equitable treatment mentioned in Article 3... \" The interpretation of this treaty provision raises questions as to the interplay and scope of the two standards of \"full and completely protected\" and \"fair and equitable treatment.\" If the Tribunal should find that a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard has taken place, does that mean that a breach of the guarantee of full and complete protection has also taken? Some tribunals in the presence of a formulation like the language employed in Article 3 quoted above have found that both breaches take place simultaneously.127\n\n*National Grid pic v. Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL), Award (3 November 2008).\n\n171.\n\nThe present Tribunal, however, takes the view that under Article 3, quoted above, the concept of full protection and security is included within the concept of fair and equitable treatment, but that the scope of full protection and security is narrower than the fair and equitable treatment. Thus, State action that violates the full protection and security clause would of necessity constitute a violation of fair and equitable treatment under the French BIT. On the other hand, all violations of fair and equitable treatment are not automatically also violations of full protection and security. Under the French BIT, it is possible for Argentina to violate its obligation of fair and equitable treatment toward the Claimants without violating its duty of full protection and security. In short, there are actions that violate fair and equitable treatment that do not violate full protection and security.\n\n172.\n\nThe fact that the French BIT employs the fair and equitable treatment standard and the full protections and security standard in two distinct articles and refers to them as separate and distinct standards leads to the conclusion that the Contracting Parties must have intended them to mean two different things. Thus, in interpreting these two standards of investor treatment it is desirable to give effect to that intention by giving the two concepts distinct meanings and fields of application.\n\n173.\n\nIn this respect, this Tribunal is of the view that the stability of the business environment and legal security are more characteristic of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, while the full protection and security standard primarily seeks to protect investment from physical harm. This said, this latter standard may also include an obligation to provide adequate mechanisms and legal remedies for prosecuting the State organs or private parties responsible for the injury caused to the investor.\n\n174.\n\nThe *Enron* tribunal discussed the more limited scope of the full protection and security standard by noting that \"there might be cases where a broader interpretation could be justified, but then it becomes difficult to distinguish such situation from one resulting in the breach of fair and equitable treatment, and even from some form of expropriation.\"128 Generally, this Tribunal also believes that an overly extensive interpretation of the full protection and security standard may result in an overlap with the other standards of investment protection, which is neither necessary nor desirable.\n\n*Supra* note 92, at para. 286; see also *PSEG Global et al. v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/5), Award (19 January 2007), at para. 259.\n\n175.\n\nAs far as this Tribunal is concerned, it is inclined to think that the absence of the word \"full\" or \"fully\" in the full protection and security provisions in the Argentina-Spain and the Argentina-U.K. BITs supports this view of an obligation limited to providing physical protection and legal remedies for the Spanish and U.K. Claimants and their assets.\n\n176.\n\nThe importance of the precise legal formulation used in a BIT provision is further illustrated in the *Siemens* award.129 In that case, the investor initiated the arbitration under the German-Argentina BIT, alleging *inter alia* that Argentina breached its obligation to accord full protection and security through the conduct that led to the frustration of the investor\u2019s contract. The respondent and the claimant had opposing positions on the scope of the protection under the BIT standard. According to Argentina, \"security\" implied only physical security, while the investor attributed to this term a wider meaning, in particular because the Treaty referred to \"legal security.\" Thus, the tribunal had to interpret whether \"security\" referred merely to physical security or to security in a wider sense. Having noted that the definition of investment included tangible and intangible assets, the tribunal said that \"the obligation to provide full protection and security is wider than \u2018physical\" protection and security.\" It provided the following reasoning:\n\nIt is difficult to understand how the physical security of an intangible asset would be achieved. In the instant case, \"security\" is qualified by \"legal\". In its ordinary meaning \"legal security\" has been defined as \"the quality of the legal system which implies certainty in its norms and, consequently, their foreseeable application.\" It is clear that in the context of this meaning the Treaty refers to security that it is not physical. In fact, one may question given the qualification of the term \"security\", whether the Treaty covers physical security at all. Arguably it could be considered to be included under \"full protection\", but that is not an issue in these proceedings. [\u00a7303]\n\nBased on this understanding of \u2018full protection and security\u2019, the tribunal concluded that Argentina\u2019s initiation of the renegotiation of the contract for the sole purpose of reducing its costs, unsupported by any declaration of public interest, affected the legal security of Siemens\u2019 investment, and thus constituted a violation of its obligations under the BIT. In these cases, none of the three BITs concerned refers to \"legal security\". Therefore, this Tribunal is of the opinion that the various formulations of protection and security employed in the present BITs cannot extend to an obligation to maintain a stable and secure legal and commercial environment.\n\n*Supra* note 93.\n\n177.\n\nWhile strict textual interpretation of the treaty language would lead this Tribunal to conclude that the applicable BITs in the present cases do not have the expansive scope on which the Claimants are basing their claim, there is another reason for the Tribunal not to follow the interpretation made in, *inter alia, CME* and *Azurix.* Neither the *CME* nor *Azurix* awards provide a historical analysis of the concept of full protection and security or give any clear reason as to why it was departing from the historical interpretation traditionally employed by courts and tribunals and expanding that concept to cover non-physical actions and injuries.\n\n178.\n\nA few awards since *CME* have maintained the more traditional approach to interpreting the notion of full protection and security. In *Saluka,130* the tribunal determined that the Czech Republic did not violate the Czech Republic-Netherlands BIT which promised investors \"full security and protection\" when it took measures to stop trading in the claimant\u2019s securities. The tribunal stated: \"The practice of arbitral tribunals seems to indicate however that the \u2018full protection and security clause\u2019 is not meant to cover just any kind of impairment of an investor\u2019s investment but to protect more specifically the physical integrity of an investment against interference by the use of force.\"131 More recently, a similar rationale has been applied by arbitral tribunals in *BG v. Argentina, PSEG v. Turkey* and *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan.132*\n\n*Supra* note 96.\n\n*Ibid, at* para. 484.\n\n*BG Group Pic v. the Argentine Republic* (UNCITRAL), Award (24 December 2007), at paras. 323-328; *PSEG v. Turkey, supra* note 128, at paras. 258-259; *Rumeli v Kazakhstan, supra* note 118, at para. 669.\n\n*C. The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions*\n-------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nHaving considered the specific language of each of the three applicable BITs and the historical development of the \"full protection and security\" standard under international law, as well as the recent jurisprudence, this Tribunal is not persuaded that it needs to depart from the traditional interpretation given to this term. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that under all the applicable BITs, Argentina is obliged to exercise due diligence to protect investors and investments primarily from physical injury, and that in any case Argentina\u2019s obligations under the relevant provisions do not extend to encompass the maintenance of a stable legal and commercial environment. As a result, in the instant cases Argentina has not violated its obligations under the respective BIT provisions.\n\n**VIII. Responsibility for Failure to Accord Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. *The Applicable Treaty Provisions*\n-------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimants further allege that Argentina has breached the applicable BITs in that it has failed to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments \"fair and equitable treatment\" as required by the treaties. Specifically they assert that Argentina has breached Articles 3 and 5(1) of the Argentina France-BIT which provide:\n\nArticle 3\n\nEach Contracting Party shall undertake to accord in its territory and maritime zone just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law, to the investments of investors of the other Party and to ensure that the exercise of the right so granted is not impeded either *de jure* or *de facto.*\n\nArticle 5\n\nInvestments made by investors of one Contracting Party shall be fully and completely protected and safeguarded in the territory and maritime zone of the other Contracting Party, in accordance with the principle of just and equitable treatment mentioned in article 3 of this Agreement.\n\n181.\n\nThey also allege that Argentina has violated Article IV(1) of the Argentina-Spain BIT:\n\n*Article IV TREATMENT*\n\nEach Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of investments made by investors of the other Party.\n\n182.\n\nAnd finally, the Claimants argue that Argentina has violated Article 2(2) of the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT:\n\nARTICLE 2\n\nPromotion and Protection of Investment\n\n2) Investments of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment and shall enjoy protection and constant protection in the territory of the other Contracting Party...\n\n183.\n\nEach of the three BITs requires Argentina to accord \"fair and equitable\" (Argentina-Spain BIT and Argentina-U.K. BIT) or \"just and equitable\" treatment (Argentina-France BIT) to the investments of the Claimants. For purposes of these cases, the Tribunal finds that \"fair and equitable\" treatment and \"just and equitable treatment\" mean the same thing, and it therefore will use the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" to refer to both treaty formulations of the standard. The Tribunal also notes that the relevant provision of the Argentina-France BIT differs from that of the Argentina-U.K. and Argentina-Spain BITs in that Article 3 of the former BIT requires the Contracting Parties to accord to protected investments \"...just and equitable treatment, in accordance with the principles of international law...\" *(fun traitement juste et \u00e9quitable, conform\u00e9ment aux principes du droit international... \"; \"un tratamiento justo y equitativo conforme a los principios de Derecho Internacional...* \"), but that neither the Argentina-Spain nor the Argentina-U.K. BITs include a similar reference to \"the principles of international law.\" None of the parties in either their written or oral pleadings has suggested that this difference in treaty language requires the Tribunal to give a different meaning to the fair and equitable standard in applying the Argentina-France BIT from that reached in applying the other two BITs applicable to these cases. The Respondent has argued, however, that the reference to \"the principles of international law\" in the Argentina-France BIT explicitly limits the content of the fair and equitable treatment obligation to the international minimum standard and that such limitation is also implicit in the other two BITs applicable to these cases.133 The Respondent\u2019s argument raises two questions that the Tribunal must answer: 1) Does the reference in the Argentina-France BIT to \"the principles of international law\" mean that the fair and equitable treatment standard is limited to the minimum international standard? and 2) Even though the other two BITs contain no specific reference to international law or the minimum international standard, should the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" in those BITs be also limited to the international minimum standard?\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial para. 875.\n\n184.\n\nAs this Decision will later discuss, the meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\" has been the subject of extensive and differing commentary by scholars and arbitral tribunals. A threshold question in its interpretation concerns the legal sources to which a tribunal should look in applying the concept of fair and equitable treatment to a specific fact situation. A survey of practice and scholarship on this question reveals three views: 1) that fair and equitable treatment must be measured only against the minimum standard required by customary international law; 2) that it must be measured against international law including all sources; and 3) that it must be measured against an independent self-contained treaty standard.134 In making a decision on this question in the present cases, the Tribunal is of course bound by the specific language of each of the applicable BITs. With respect to the Argentina-France BIT, it is to be noted that the text of the treaty refers simply to \"the principles of international law,\" not to \"the minimum standard under customary international law.\" The formulation \"minimum standard under customary international law\" or simply \"minimum international standard\" is so well known and so well established in international law that one can assume that if France and Argentina had intended to limit the content of fair and equitable treatment to the minimum international standard they would have used that formulation specifically. In fact, they did not.\n\nOECD, *Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard in International Investment Law* (Working Paper on International Investment 2004/3, September 2004) p. 8.\n\n185.\n\nFollowing accepted principles of treaty interpretation, particularly Article 31(1) of the VCLT which requires that treaty terms be interpreted in accordance with their \"ordinary meaning,\" the Tribunal concludes that \"in accordance with the principles of international law\" means just what it says: that the tribunal is to interpret fair and equitable treatment under Article 3 of the Argentina-France BIT in accordance with all relevant sources of international and that it is not limited in its interpretation to the international minimum standard. The ordinary meaning of the words \"principles of international law\" is \"the legal principles derived from all sources of international law.\" Authoritative documents employing the term \"international law\" contain no implication that the term is limited to the international minimum standard and amply support the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation of the term \"international law.\" Thus, Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice states that the function of the Court is to \"decide in accordance with international law...\" and then proceeds in the broadest terms to list the basic sources of international law. Similarly, the Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States, para. 101, provides that \"international law...consists of rules and principles of general application dealing with the conduct of states and of international organizations and with their relations inter se, as well as with some of their relations with persons, whether natural or juridical.\" The Tribunal therefore rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard in the Argentina-France BIT is limited to the international minimum standard.\n\n186.\n\nWith regard to the other two applicable BITs, which contain no specific reference to the principles of international law, there is even less plausible justification to limit the interpretation of fair and equitable treatment to the international minimum standard. Consequently, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s argument that the fair and equitable treatment standard as embodied in the Argentina-Spain BIT and the Argentina-U.K. is implicitly limited by the minimum international standard. The Tribunal also concludes that the reference to \"the principles of international\" included in the Argentina-France BIT does not entail a different content in said treaty from that found in the other two BITs. In interpreting the words \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"just and equitable treatment\" found in the other two BITs and in applying them to determine the responsibility of the Respondent, the Tribunal, as it stated above in paras. 60-62 in its discussion of the applicable law, is bound to apply the principles of international law.\n\n187.\n\nThe term \"fair and equitable treatment\" has certain characteristics that must be recognized in applying it in these cases. First, it is a vague and ambiguous expression on its face and is not defined in any of the treaties applicable to these cases. Second, it has been widely used in hundreds of investment treaties throughout the world over the years with the result that numerous arbitral tribunals have interpreted and applied it to investor-State disputes arising in a wide variety of circumstances. Third, it is a flexible term that applies to all kinds of investments in all industries and economic endeavors.135 Indeed, it is invoked so often in contemporary investor-State arbitration that one scholar has labeled it \"an almost ubiquitous presence\" in investment litigation.136\n\nSee C. Schreuer, *Fair and Equitable Treatment in Arbitral Practice,* 6 JWIT 3, pp. 357-386.\n\nRudoph Dolzer, *Fair and Equitable Treatment: A Key Standard in Investment Treaties,* 39 The International Lawyer 87 (2005).\n\n188.\n\nA fourth important characteristic of the term is that its application is crucially dependent on an evaluation of the facts of each case. As the tribunal in *Mondev* pointed out \"[a] judgment of what is fair and equitable cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case\"137 Similarly, the tribunal in *Waste Management (II)* stated \"the standard is to some extent a flexible one which must be adapted to the circumstances of each case.\"138 A fifth and final characteristic, evidenced by its wide use, generality, and flexibility, is that the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" seems to be viewed by Contracting States as a basic standard of treatment to be accorded to investors. The fundamental purposes of investment treaties, as stated in their titles, are to promote and protect investments. Certainly, neither of those purposes could be achieved if treaties promised foreign investors treatment that was less than fair and less equitable. Indeed, to borrow the terminology of Hans Kelsen,139 it is no exaggeration to say that the obligation of a host State to accord fair and equitable treatment to foreign investors is the *Grundnorm* or basic norm of international investment law.\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award, (11 October 2002), at para 118, 6 ICSID Reports 192,at para. 118.\n\n*Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States,* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3) Award (30 April 2004), at para. 99.\n\nHans Kelsen, *The Pure Theory of Law* (1934).\n\n189.\n\nIn interpreting this vague, flexible, basic, and widely used treaty term, this Tribunal has the benefit of decisions by prior tribunals that have struggled strenuously, knowledgeably, and sometimes painfully, to interpret the words \"fair and equitable\" in a wide variety of factual situations and investment relationships. Many of these cases arose out of Argentina\u2019s economic crisis of 2001-2003. Although this tribunal is not bound by such prior decisions,140 they do constitute \"a subsidiary means for the determination of the rules of [international] law.\"141 Moreover, considerations of basic justice would lead tribunals to be guided by the basic judicial principle that \u2018like cases should be decided alike,\u2019 unless a strong reason exists to distinguish the current case from previous ones. In addition, a recognized goal of international investment law is to establish a predictable, stable legal framework for investments, a factor that justifies tribunals in giving due regard to previous decisions on similar issues. Thus, absent compelling reasons to the contrary, a tribunal should always consider heavily solutions established in a series of consistent cases.\n\nArticle 53(1) of the ICSID Convention states: \u2018The award shall be binding on the parties...\u2019 Schreuer suggests that this provision may be interpreted as \"...excluding the applicability of the principle of binding precedent to successive ICSID cases.\" He also notes that there is nothing in the preparatory work of the Convention suggesting that the doctrine of precedent should be applied to ICSID arbitration. C Schreuer, *A Doctrine of Precedent!\u2019* in P. Muchlinksi *et al* The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law (2008) 1190.\n\nStatute of the International Court of Justice, Article 38(1)(d).\n\nB. *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n----------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Argentina failed to accord their investments fair and equitable treatment as required by the three applicable BITs. Drawing on several arbitral decisions, many of which arose out of the Argentine crisis, as did the present dispute, the Claimants argue that the principle of fair and equitable treatment protects foreign investors from the fundamental alteration of the investment framework which defeats the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations. The bedrock concepts advanced by the Claimants are that Argentina actions (1) made fundamental alterations of the investment framework and (2) defeated the legitimate expectations of the Claimants as investors. They argue that Argentina actively encouraged the Claimants to invest in the water and sewage systems of Buenos Aires, and that important elements of that inducement were the various commitments that Argentina made to them in the legal framework governing the investment. For Argentina to make unilateral, fundamental alterations in that framework and thereby frustrate the legitimate expectations of the Claimants is a denial of the fair and equitable treatment that Argentina promised to accord to investors in each of the three BITS applicable to this dispute. They note that fair and equitable treatment is separate from the international minimum standard which in any case also sanctions conduct altering the investment framework in breach of legitimate investor expectations. Bad faith or malicious intent by a respondent State is not required to establish violation of the treatment standard.\n\n191.\n\nThe Claimants point in particular to three general areas in which Argentina\u2019s actions violated fair and equitable treatment with respect to the Claimants\u2019 investments: 1) Argentina\u2019s failure to assure respect for the equilibrium principle and to revise the Concession\u2019s tariff in accordance with its legal framework, thereby altering the legal framework of the investment contrary to the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations; 2) Argentina\u2019s efforts to force the renegotiation of the Concession Contract; and 3) Argentina\u2019s unilateral termination of the Concession Contract in 2006. The Tribunal will consider each of these three types of actions in turn.\n\n**1. Measures Altering the Investment Framework**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Argentina took numerous measures in 2002 that were fundamental alterations of the investment framework contrary to their legitimate expectations. These measures, include, in summary: (i) the January 2002 Law, formally altering the Regulatory Framework by abolishing the automatic annual tariff adjustments for costs in accordance with international indices (Article 8), setting aside the tariff regime while establishing a binding renegotiation process (Article 9), and requiring all companies affected to continue observing all obligations under the relevant contracts and regulatory frameworks (Article 10); (ii) Decree 293/02, dated 14 February 2002, establishing the process for the mandatory renegotiation of contracts in lieu of promised tariff reviews; (iii) letter of ETOSS to AASA, dated 14 February 2002, confirming that the January 2002 Law had set aside AASA\u2019s tariff regime, which would otherwise have required the adjustment of tariffs given the alteration of the Argentine Peso - U.S. Dollar parity, and thereby refusing any tariff adjustments and reminding AASA of its obligation not to suspend or alter its compliance with all obligations pursuant to Article 10 of the January 2002 Law; (iv) MoE Resolution No 38/02 dated 10 April 2002, which prohibited regulatory authorities such as ETOSS from taking any measure that would increase tariffs under their supervision until the end of the renegotiation process, thereby preventing the ETOSS from applying any of the tariff adjustment provisions of the Regulatory Framework and effectively abolishing AASA\u2019s tariff regime; and (v) Decree No 1,090/02, dated 26 June 2002 and MoE Resolution No 308/02, dated 20 August 2002, by which Argentina threatened public service companies, including AASA, not to pursue their legitimate rights and remedies by submitting any claims to any court or tribunal, including international arbitration, on pain of exclusion from the renegotiation process.\n\n193.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that Argentina placed a disproportionate and discriminatory burden on AASA contrary to its duty to actively protect the Claimants\u2019 investments under the fair and equitable treatment standard. Prices were not frozen in all other sectors of the economy, for example the gas production and banking sectors. For example, Hidrov\u00eda S.A., a joint venture between a Belgian and an Argentine company, which manages the concession of a navigation channel in the Paran\u00e1 River, obtained a 45% guaranteed tariff increase.142\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, 525, 366.\n\n**2. Imposed Renegotiation**\n----------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that numerous actions taken during the imposed process to renegotiate the AASA Concession violated the Respondent\u2019s obligation to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment.\n\n195.\n\nIn the first phase of those efforts at renegotiation, Argentina kept extending the deadline for renegotiation, or in the words of the Claimants, made \"...endless and mechanical extensions of the unfruitful renegotiation process from June 2002, when the initial 120-day period for the renegotiation ended, to the date of eviction from the Concession in March 2006 without any relief for AASA\u2019s grave economic and financial imbalance.\"143\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6, 307.\n\n196.\n\nA second phase of the attempted renegotiation, beginning in May 2003 with the election of President Kirchner, according to the Claimants, also included numerous instances of unfair and inequitable treatment by Argentina. These included (1) a sharp increase in the penalties imposed, (2) the unilateral extension of the *Fideicomiso, i. e.* the trust account set up and into which certain tariff increases would be paid to finance part of the projected investments in the Service, (3) the requirement that AASA provide service in areas not previously within the Concession. These measures were implemented by (i) the letter from the Renegotiation Commission to AASA of 2 April 2003, attaching the first proposal for a transitory agreement, which according to the Claimants reflected none of the issues discussed during the previous 14 months of renegotiation. This proposal only granted AASA five days to conduct its analysis and respond. Further, the proposal would not have relieved pressure on AASA\u2019s situation, but would have aggravated it; (ii) the letter from ETOSS to AASA No 17,407/03, of 27 June 2003, by which Argentina required that AASA execute an agreement for the *Fideicomiso,* which according to the Claimants further aggravated the financial situation of AASA; (iii) Decree 311/03, dated 4 July 2003, by which Argentina changed the rules of the renegotiation process, creating a new entity, UNIREN, in charge of the renegotiation and thus effectively recommenced the renegotiation process from the beginning; (iv) ETOSS Resolution 86/03, dated 6 August 2003, by which Argentina forced AASA to set up the **Fideicomiso** and transfer to it the amounts corresponding to the 3.9% tariff increases applied by AASA in 2001 and 2002, without regard to AASA\u2019s difficulties, and which threatened the call of the Performance Bond and the imposition of penalties in the event of AASA\u2019s failure to comply; (v) Law No 25,790, dated 22 October 2003, providing that the process of renegotiating public contracts was \"not limited or conditioned\" by the provisions of their regulatory frameworks, *i.e.* that Argentina could completely derogate from or ignore them, and that the jurisdiction of the regulators on tariff reviews could only be exercised subject to the renegotiation process; (vi) Disposition of the SSRH144 No. 76, dated 2 December 2003, and Disposition of the SSRH No. 58, dated 29 December 2004, unilaterally extending the **Fideicomiso** for 2004 and 2005, and thus once again aggravating the financial situation of the Concession.\n\nSubsecretar\u00eda de Recursos Hidricos\n\n197.\n\nA third phase of the renegotiation, which began at the end of 2003 with the resumption of negotiations with the Government, resulted in the 2004 Transitory Agreement145 signed with the UNIREN on 11 May 2004. Its effect was not an immediate tariff adjustment but it did provide some \"breathing space and the promise of a final agreement by the end of 2004\"146. As a result, the arbitration was suspended until December 2004 (hence showing the Claimants\u2019 cooperation), AASA made a further investment of US$ 230 million, and its debt was to be restructured before June 30, 2004. An interim financial agreement was reached on July 15, 2004 in which AASA obtained a discount of US$ 145 million on its debts. AASA\u2019s debt restructuring occurred in March 2006.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit 148.\n\nClaimants\u2019Reply \u00b6, U 210.\n\n198.\n\nA fourth phase of the renegotiation began in 2004 with the expiry of the 2004 Transitory Agreement, without any improvement in the renegotiation process. The Claimants allege that the Argentine Government failed to comply with its obligations under the Transitory Agreement. Moreover, at that point, according to the Claimants, Argentina\u2019s attitude towards AASA is said to have \"turned hostile.\"147 The Government imposed another unilateral extension of the Trust Agreement with an allocation of ARS 42 million per year to finance certain expansion investments specified by the State. On January 11, 2005, AASA was asked to comply with all its obligations under the Contract including payment of pending penalties (ETOSS Resolution No 1/05).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6, \u00b6 211\n\n199.\n\nThe same day it was fined ARS 2 million for an emergency shutdown. The Claimants complain more particularly of (i) the ETOSS Resolutions 1/05 and 2/05, dated 11 January 2005, respectively forcing AASA to comply with all its obligations under the Concession Contract and fining AASA for failing to inform the authorities of an emergency shutdown (which was initiated due to public health concerns; (ii) UNIREN\u2019s proposal on 25 July 2005 of a renegotiated transitory agreement which failed to reflect previous discussions, and failed to spell out basic aspects of the future agreement, while requiring the Claimants to withdraw their ICSID claims and waive all past and future claims, prior to any of the ratifications and authorizations being provided by the Executive Branch; (iii) the letter from the Sub-Secretary of Water Resources to AASA, dated 29 July 2005 once again ignoring AASA\u2019s request formulated on 26 July 2005 for the reestablishment of the equilibrium of the Concession and denying AASA\u2019s right to seek the termination of the Concession Contract; (iv) the constant vilifying of AASA in the press which increased in intensity in the second half of 2005; and (v) Argentina's thwarting of AASA\u2019s shareholders\u2019 attempts, in late 2005 and early 2006, to transfer shares in AASA to local investors.\n\n**3. Unilateral Termination of the Concession**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that the abrupt termination by Argentina of the Concession in 2006 violated the Respondent\u2019s treaty promises of fair and equitable treatment. Specifically, they complain of Decree 303/06, dated 21 March 2006, by which Argentina unilaterally and under false pretences terminated the Concession without compensation, ignoring its responsibility for the repudiation of the Equilibrium Principle. They point to the fact that after the termination the Secretary of Public Works announced that ARS 349 million would be immediately invested in the new State-owned operator in contrast to its previous assertions of inability to revise the tariff for reasons of financial stringency. They allege that under the fair and equitable treatment standard, Argentina was required actively to protect the Claimants and their investments but that instead, Argentina \"refused to cooperate with AASA and its shareholders for over four years, and then terminated the Concession unilaterally and without any regard for the losses incurred by AASA and its shareholders.\"148\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply \u00b6 1465.\n\nC. *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nArgentina argues that the Claimants have not shown that its alleged acts and omissions amounted to conduct that falls below the fair and equitable treatment standard. Moreover, it denies that its actions toward the Claimants investments violated the standard of fair and equitable treatment. Argentina asserts that it fulfilled its obligations in the light of the circumstances of the case. In any event, even if there were a failure to comply with the Concession Contract, such shortcoming would not amount to unfair and inequitable treatment. A showing of a treaty violation must be clear, but according to Argentina the Claimants\u2019 case fails to clearly establish such a finding. In addition Argentina argues that while Claimants can invoke their shareholdings in AASA to establish that they have an investment for jurisdictional purposes, they cannot seek the substantive protection of the BITs with respect to a contractual relationship to which they are not a party.\n\n202.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal must analyze the conduct of the parties, taking into account all the circumstances of the case. In all the circumstances, it asserts that it \"acted in a reasonable, responsible, non discriminatory and proportionate manner in the light of its responsibility to the population within AASA\u2019s Concession area in the extraordinary economic circumstances that prevailed,\"149 the provision of drinking water and sewage services being of the highest of public purposes. It therefore argues that all the measures it took during the financial crisis were within its police powers as a sovereign State. Specifically, with respect to the termination of the Concession, Argentina asserts that it acted reasonably in the circumstances, that the Claimants had declared their intention to abandon the Concession, and that Argentina had a responsibility to assure the continuation of a public service that was vital to the health and wellbeing of its population.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter Memorial \u00b6892.\n\n203.\n\nSecondly, Argentina argues that its actions were entirely foreseeable and that it therefore did not frustrate the legitimate expectations of the investors. According to Argentina, it was foreseeable that the Argentina government would adopt special measures in the event of a crisis, that in a crisis situation Argentina would seek to renegotiate concession contracts, and that in the face of the Claimants\u2019 threat to abandon the Concession it would have to take measures to assure the continuation of a vital public service. Further, regarding the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations, Argentina argues that if the State made any representations or commitments, it was to AASA and not to its shareholders. The fair and equitable standard cannot generate expectations that have no grounding in the contractual documents regulating the relation between the State and the investor. Since there were no extra contractual guarantees regarding automatic tariff adjustment either to AASA or to the Claimants, it was wholly unreasonable for the Claimants to expect that the Republic would endorse a massive tariff increase given the severity of the crisis. As discussed by the *ad hoc* committee in *MTD v Chile,150* and as confirmed in *MCI* v. *Ecuador,151* the *Tecmed152* standard that converts investor\u2019s expectations into international obligations is questionable.\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd.and MTD Chile S.A. v. Republic of Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Decision on Annulment (21 March 2007), at para. 67.\n\n*M.C.I. Power Group L.C. and New Turbine Inc. v.Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/6), Award (July 31, 2007) at para. 278.\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED S.A. v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)00/2), Award (29 May 2003).\n\n204.\n\nWith respect to the efforts to renegotiate the Concession Contract in light of the crisis, Argentina contends that it acted reasonably and that AASA and the Claimants were unreasonable and uncooperative during that process. For example, Argentina asserts that after the enactment of the Emergency Law, AASA\u2019s first attitude was to disregard the latter and ask for tariff reviews. Its emergency plan presented in February 2002 aimed at suspending many of its duties. The Renegotiation Commission of contracts for public works and services created on February 12, 2002 made its comments on AASA\u2019s emergency plan on May 16, 2002. The commission prepared a preliminary report on the Concession in June 2002 and rendered its final report on October 31, 2002. The Commission pointed out that the 1997-1999 tariff review system was not feasible in the light of the macroeconomic context, and that AASA\u2019s proposals implied a deep renegotiation of the agreement instead of a mere tariff increase. The Commission offered negotiation alternatives. The parties agreed to an emergency agreement in the short term and a final and integral renegotiation of the Concession contract. AASA was asked to file an economic financial plan and a service improvement and expansion plan. Submissions were made on December 4, 2002.\n\n205.\n\nAlthough the Claimants allege that the renegotiation process was coerced, Argentina asserts that in its submission to the Renegotiation Commission on December 4, 2002, AASA expressed its agreement with the renegotiation process. It accepted to adapt the agreement to the new economic reality to achieve a new economic financial balance. It is therefore unreasonable to say that the Claimants were forced to renegotiate. They voluntarily ratified the 2004 memorandum. Argentina denies that the renegotiations were unnecessarily long, pointing to the fact that negotiations of 1997, in which AASA fully participated and from which it secured requested revisions, took three years to complete.\n\n206.\n\nThroughout the renegotiations, AASA failed to adapt its attitude to one of cooperation. According to Argentina, the final renegotiation failed due to AASA\u2019s behavior. Not only did AASA fail to restructure its debt, but it also failed to provide important documents\u2019 requested as of August 2004. Other acts by AASA contributing to the failure of the renegotiation were the fact that AASA \"...(a) [f]ailed to submit the model company; (b) Failed to submit the regulatory accounting in due time; (c) Failed to submit an analysis of the impact of the tariff increase alternatives on users; (d) Failed to determine the tariff increases it expected and to submit the proposal for a new tariff regime; (e) Failed to submit an assessment of the impact on the resources of the Concession\"153\n\nRespondents\u2019 Rejoinder \u00b6664.\n\n207.\n\nIn spite of these failures by AASA, UNIREN presented a draft memorandum of agreement on 14 June 2005, providing that AASA was to recover its capital base through tariff income and through a final payment to be made by the State at the end of the Concession. AASA rejected this offer on 1 August 2005 and by September 2005 negotiations had broken down.\n\n208.\n\nIn general, Argentina asserts that the renegotiation process was open and transparent. It did not entail an obligation of result but simply one of means. It also pursued an equitable outcome. Toward this end, Argentina made concessions to AASA. Specifically it asserts that \"[s]ome of the Concessions made by the State for the purpose of reaching an agreement are: a) authorization to give a Performance Bond in Argentine Pesos refraining from imposing penalties for the time being, in spite of the companys continuous breaches; b) \u2018pesification\u2019 of loans obtained in US dollars from Argentine financial entities; c) elimination, at that time, of Concessionaires\u2019 filing for reorganization or bankruptcy proceedings, as a ground for termination of Concession agreements. Again, agreements having failed, nothing prevented the State from exercising such contractual and statutory power of Termination of the Concession contract due to AASA\u2019s fault\"154.\n\nRespondents\u2019Rejoinder \u00b6645.\n\n209.\n\nFollowing a shareholder\u2019s meeting of 22 September 2005, authorizing AASA to terminate the Concession, AASA asked the Argentine authorities for the termination and requested provisional acceptance of the Concession assets as soon as possible, as well as the restitution of the agreement Performance Bond. The Under-Secretariat of Water Resources refused the request since there was no cause of termination due to the conceding authority\u2019s fault as required by the Concession Contract and the legal framework.\n\n210.\n\nWith respect to AASA\u2019s efforts to terminate the Concession, Argentina notes that Banco de Galicia, which held 8.26% of AASA\u2019s shares, instituted proceedings in Argentina to declare the decision of the shareholders\u2019 meeting of 22 September 2005 void because it was made to the detriment to the corporate interest and in breach of the companies law. It adds that, in its opinion, the Claimants used the Argentine crisis as an excuse to flee the country because the AASA Concession was insufficiently profitable.\n\nD. *Analysis*\n-------------\n\n211.\n\nIn order to evaluate the arguments of the Claimants and the Respondent, this Tribunal must interpret and apply the above-quoted BIT provisions concerning Argentina\u2019s obligations to accord covered investments fair and equitable treatment. In this task, it is guided by Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties pursuant to which: \"(1) [a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the *ordinary meaning* to be given the terms of the treaty *in their context* and in *light of its object and purpose\"* (emphasis added).Thus three elements are of particular importance in interpreting the relevant treaty provisions: (1) the ordinary meaning of the term \"fair and equitable,\" (2) the context in which the term \"fair and equitable\" is used; and (3) the object and purpose of the three BITs.\n\n212.\n\nAt the outset, it should be noted that none of the BITs applicable to these cases define the three key words: \"fair,\" \"equitable,\" and \"treatment.\" \"Treatment,\" according to the Oxford English Dictionary, is \"Conduct, behaviour; action or behaviour towards a person.\" In its decision on jurisdiction in these cases, the Tribunal stated the following with respect to the meaning of \"treatment:\" \"The word \"treatment\" is not defined in the treaty text. However, the ordinary meaning of that term within the context of investment includes the rights and privileges granted and the obligations and burdens imposed by a Contracting State on investments made by investors covered by the treaty.\" The Tribunal will continue to employ that definition for purposes of this Decision on Liability. It should also be noted that under the terms of all three BITs the subject of the promised fair and equitable treatment is not the investor, but rather the investments made by the investor.\n\n213.\n\nDefining the words \"fair and equitable,\" given their generality, vagueness, and the diverse ways in which those terms may be understood in various cultures and countries creates an especially difficult challenge. As the tribunal in *Saluka* stated after making its own strenuous efforts in this regard:\n\nThe \"ordinary meaning\" of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard can only be defined by terms of almost equal vagueness. In *MTD,* the tribunal stated that: \"In their ordinary meaning, the terms \"fair\" and \"equitable\" [... ] mean \"just\", \"even handed\", \"unbiased\" \"legitimate.\" On the basis of such and similar definitions, one cannot say more than the tribunal did in *S.D. Myers* by stating that an infringement of the standard requires \"treatment in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to a level that is unacceptable from an international perspective.155\n\nAs a result, analyzing the ordinary meaning of the terms \"fair and equitable treatment\" as they are used in the three BITs applicable to the present dispute yields little additional enlightenment.\n\n*Supra* note 96, at paragraph 297.\n\n214.\n\nThe context of the term \"fair and equitable\" largely depends upon the contents of the treaty in which it is employed. Thus, the term must be interpreted not as three words plucked from the BIT text but within the context of the various rights and responsibilities, with all their various conditions and limitations, to which the Contracting Parties agreed. However, conducting such analysis *in abstracto,* namely without addressing specific relations between specific provisions of the BITs, would not take us further than the analysis of the ordinary meaning of the terms \"fair and equitable\".\n\n215.\n\nAnd finally, following the directives of Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the Tribunal must take account of the objects and purposes of the three BITs. Here, one must turn to the BIT preambles which express those objects and purposes. Each of the three BITs states those objects and purposes in slightly different language with slightly different emphasis. For example, the Preamble of the Argentina-France BIT states:\n\nDesiring to develop economic cooperation between the two States and to create favorable conditions for French investments in Argentina and Argentine investments in France,\n\nConvinced that the promotion and protection of such investments are likely to stimulate transfers of capital and technology between the two countries in the interest of their economic development...\n\nThus the purpose of the treaty is not merely to protect investments but to advance economic cooperation between France and Argentina and to achieve economic development of the two States by stimulating transfers of capital and technology.\n\n216.\n\nThe Preamble of the Argentina-Spain BIT provides as follows:\n\nDesiring to intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both countries,\n\nIntending to create favorable conditions for investments made by investors of either State in the territory of the Other State,\n\nRecognizing that the promotion and protection of investments in accordance with this Agreement will encourage initiatives in this field...\n\nHere, too, the BIT seeks broad objectives beyond just investor protection in that its stated goal is to intensify economic cooperation between the two states so that both states may benefit from that economic intensification.\n\n217.\n\nAnd finally, the Preamble to the Argentina-U.K. BIT states as follows:\n\nDesiring to create favorable conditions for greater investment by investors of one\n\nState in the territory of the other State;\n\nRecognizing that the encouragement and reciprocal protection under international agreement of such investments will be conducive to the stimulation of individual initiative and will increase prosperity in both States...\n\nThis BIT also has as general goals the stimulation of business initiative and the increase in the prosperity of both Argentina and the United Kingdom.\n\n218.\n\nWhen one examines the stated purposes of the three BITs, one sees that they all have broader goals than merely granting specific levels of protection to individual investors. In the case of the Argentina-France BIT and the Argentina-Spain BIT, the Contracting States are seeking to further economic cooperation between them. The protection and promotion of foreign investment, while important to attaining that goal, are only a means to that end. Similarly, the Argentina-U.K. BIT is seeking to increase the prosperity of the two States. Through these treaties, the Contracting States pursue the broader goals of heightened economic cooperation between the two States concerned with a view toward achieving increased economic prosperity or development. The Tribunal must take those broader goals into consideration when it interprets and applies the term \"fair and equitable treatment\" in these cases.\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the goal of \"economic cooperation,\" stated in the Argentina-France and the Argentina-Spain BITs, reaffirms and indeed strengthens, rather than diminishes, the importance of \"fair and equitable treatment\" in the treaty structure created by the Contracting Parties. The word \"cooperation\", interpreted by reference to its Uatin origins, means the action of working together. \"Economic cooperation\" refers to working together in the economic domain. Implicit in the notion of \"economic cooperation between States\" is the commitment to give fair and equitable treatment to important economic actors, such as investors, of a Contracting Party with which a State has committed to cooperate. Indeed, it is difficult to see how cooperation in the economic and investment domain could ever take place unless such fair and equitable treatment is accorded by each State to protected investors and investments from the other State. Thus, this Tribunal considers that fair and equitable treatment of investors is the *sine qua non* of the economic cooperation envisaged by France, Spain, and Argentina in two of the BITs applicable to this case.\n\n220.\n\nAlthough the Argentina-U.K. BIT does not refer to economic cooperation as a stated goal, the emphasis that it places on the desire \"to create favorable conditions for investment\" and \"the stimulation of individual initiative\" implicitly emphasizes the importance of fair and equitable treatment of investments, for none of these goals could be achieved if a Contracting Party granted investments from the other Contracting Party anything less than treatment that is fair and equitable.\n\n221.\n\nWhat, then, is the meaning of \"fair and equitable treatment\" with respect to the investments undertaken by the Claimants? Philosophers and scholars have devoted tomes to the subject of fairness.156 While their work is helpful in understanding the abstract concept and its implications, it does not answer a fundamental and practical question that every arbitral tribunal must answer: By what criteria, standard, or test is an arbitral tribunal to determine whether the specific treatment accorded to the investments of a particular foreign investor in a given context is or is not \"fair and equitable.\"? To say that \"fair and equitable\" means \"just,\" \"even-handed,\" \"unbiased,\" or \"legitimate,\" as some tribunals have done,157 is quite frankly to state a tautology. Such formulations are not judicially operational in the sense that they lend themselves to being readily applied to complex, concrete investment fact situations, like those found in the present cases.\n\nSee, e.g. John Rawls, *Justice as Fairness* (2001); Thomas Franck, *Fairness in International Law* (1995).\n\nSee for example the tribunal in *MTD v. Chile (supra* note 150) stating the standards as follows \"... in terms of the BIT, fair and equitable treatment should be understood to be treatment in an even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment.\" para. 113; approved by the Annulment Committee, Decision on Annulment, 21 March 2007, para. 71 (\"Thirdly, a standard formulated in the terms of paragraph 113 is defensible.\")\n\n222.\n\nIn an effort to develop an operational method for determining the existence or nonexistence of fair and equitable treatment, arbitral tribunals have increasingly taken into account the legitimate expectations that a host country has created in the investor and the extent to which conduct by the host government subsequent to the investment has frustrated those expectations. When an investor undertakes an investment, a host government through its laws, regulations, declared policies, and statements creates in the investor certain expectations about the nature of the treatment that it may anticipate from the host State. The resulting reasonable and legitimate expectations are important factors that influence initial investment decisions and afterwards the manner in which the investment is to be managed. The theoretical basis of this approach no doubt is found in the work of the eminent scholar Max Weber, who advanced the idea that one of the main contributions of law to any social system is to make economic life more calculable and also argued that capitalism arose in Europe because European law demonstrated a high degree of \"calculability.\"158 An investor\u2019s expectations, created by law of a host country, are in effect calculations about the future.\n\nMax Weber, *Economy and Society* 847, 855 (1922). See also David Trubek, *\"Max Weber and the Rise of Capitalism\"* Wisconsin Law Review 720-53 (1971) and Richard Swedberg, *\"Max Weber\u2019s Contribution to the Economic Sociology of Law\"* 2 Annu. Rev. Law Soc. Sci..61-81 (2006).\n\n223.\n\nWhere a government through its actions subsequently frustrates or thwarts those legitimate expectations, arbitral tribunals have found that such host government has failed to accord the investments of that investor fair and equitable treatment. For example in *Saluka,* the tribunal stated:\n\nAn investor\u2019s decision to make an investment is based on an assessment of the state of the law and the totality of the business environment at the time of the investment as well as on the investor\u2019s expectation that the conduct of the host State subsequent to the investment will be fair and equitable.\n\nThe standard of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 is therefore closely tied to the notion of legitimate expectations which is the dominant element of that standard. By virtue of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard included in [the treaty] the Czech Republic must therefore be regarded as having assumed an obligation to treat foreign investors so as to avoid the frustration of investors\u2019 legitimate and reasonable expectations.159\n\n*Supra* note 96, at paras.301-302.\n\n224.\n\nNumerous other tribunals have also linked the concept of fair and equitable treatment to the host state\u2019s respect of the legitimate expectations which the investor had at the time of the investment. For example, in the *Tecmed* award, cited by subsequent cases,160 the tribunal stated:\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal considers that this provision of the Agreement, in light of the good faith principle established by international law, requires the Contracting Parties to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment.\n\nIt is true that certain elements of the *Tecmed* standard have come under criticism for being too broad. Yet, its main components, and especially the importance of the parties\u2019 legitimate and reasonable expectations have been confirmed in later decisions. For example, the Annulment Committee in *MTD v. Chile,* which questioned certain aspects of *Tecmed,* specifically stated: \"...legitimate expectations, generated as a result of the investor\u2019s dealings with the competent authorities of the host State may be relevant to the application of the guarantees contained in an investment treaty.\"161 The *MTD* Annulment Committee criticized the *Tecmed* decision for its \"apparent reliance on the foreign investor\u2019s expectations as the source of the host State\u2019s obligations (such as the obligation to compensate for expropriation)\" as being \"questionable,\" stating the obvious fact in any investor-State dispute under a BIT that \"[t]he obligations of the host State towards foreign investors derive from the terms of the applicable investment treaty and not from any set of expectations investors may have or claim to have.\"162 In the present case, this Tribunal affirms that the source of Argentina\u2019s obligations toward the Claimants reside only in the BITs and that the Tribunal\u2019s task is to interpret the nature and scope Argentina\u2019s obligation to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments \u2018fair and equitable treatment\" within the context of the facts presented in these cases.\n\n*E.g. LG&E supra* note 78, at para. 127; *MTD supra* note 150, at para 114; *Occidental supra* note 85 at para. 185; *CMS supra* note 86, at para 279.\n\n*Supra* note 152 at para. 69.\n\n*Ibid* at para. 67.\n\n225.\n\nOther tribunals have also taken into account investor expectations in interpreting the fair and equitable treatment standard. For instance, the tribunal in *Bayindir v. Pakistan* noted that:\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Bayindir when it identifies the different factors which emerge from decisions of investment tribunals as forming part of the FET standard. These comprise the obligation to act transparently and grant due process, to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures, from exercising coercion or from frustrating the investor's reasonable expectations with respect to the legal framework affecting the investment.163\n\n*Supra* note 106, at para. 178, and references cited therein.\n\n226.\n\nIn examining the various cases that have justifiably considered the legitimate expectations of investors and the extent to which the host government has frustrated them, this Tribunal finds that an important element of such cases has not been sufficiently emphasized: that investors, deriving their expectations from the laws and regulations adopted by the host country, *acted in reliance upon those laws and regulations and changed their economic position as a result.* Thus it was not the investor\u2019s legitimate expectations alone that led tribunals to find a denial of fair and equitable treatment. It was the existence of such expectations created by host country laws, coupled with the act of investing their capital in reliance on them, and a subsequent, sudden change in those laws that led to a determination that the host country had not treated the investors fair and equitably.\n\n227.\n\nIn the instant cases, it should be emphasized that the expectations of the Claimants with respect to their investment in the water and sewage system of Buenos Aires did not suddenly and surprisingly come into their minds the way Athena sprang from the head of Zeus. Argentina through its laws, the treaties it signed, its government statements, and especially the elaborate legal framework which it designed and enacted, deliberately and actively sought to create those expectations in the Claimants and other potential investors in order to obtain the capital and technology that it needed to revitalize and expand the Buenos Aires water and sewage system.\n\n228.\n\nHowever, in keeping with the BITs\u2019 basic goal of fostering economic cooperation and prosperity, one must not look single-mindedly at the Claimants\u2019 subjective expectations. The Tribunal must rather examine them from an objective and reasonable point of view. It must ask a fundamental question: What would have been the legitimate and reasonable expectations of a reasonable investor in the position of the Claimants, at the time they made their investment in 1993, about a proposed water and sewage concession investment that was to continue over a period of thirty years in Argentina, in view of the concession\u2019s legal framework and bearing in mind that country\u2019s history and its political, economic, and social circumstances?\n\n229.\n\nOf course, a Contracting Party under a BIT\u2019s fair and equitable treatment standard is not required to satisfy all of an investor\u2019s expectations. It is required to respect only those expectations that are legitimate and reasonable in the circumstances. What specifically are the characteristics of such expectations? The tribunal in *LG&E v. Argentina* tried to answer that question. It stated: \"It can be said that the investor\u2019s fair expectations have the following characteristics: they are based on the conditions offered by the host State at the time of the investment; they may not be established unilaterally by one of the parties; they must exist and be enforceable by law; in the event of infringement by the host State, a duty to compensate the investor for damages arises except for those caused in the event of state of necessity; however, the investor\u2019s fair expectations cannot fail to consider parameters such as business risk or industry\u2019s regulatory patterns.\"164\n\n*LG&E supra* note 78, at para. 130.\n\n230.\n\nIn a similar vein, the tribunal in *Duke v. Ecuador* stated that \"[t]he stability of the legal and business environment is directly linked to the investor\u2019s justified expectations. The Tribunal acknowledges that such expectations are an important element of fair and equitable treatment. At the same time, it is mindful of their limitations. To be protected, the investor\u2019s expectations must be legitimate and reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment. The assessment of the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account all circumstances, including not only the facts surrounding the investment, but also the political, socioeconomic, cultural and historical conditions prevailing in the host State. In addition, such expectations must arise from the conditions that the State offered the investor and the latter must have relied upon them when deciding to invest.\"165\n\n*Duke Energy Electroquil Partners and Electroquil S.A. v. Republic of Ecuador* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/19), Award (18 August 2008), at para. 340.\n\n231.\n\nThe Concession Contract and the legal framework of the Concession described above clearly meet the conditions proposed in the cases just referred to. They set down the conditions offered by Argentina at the time that Claimants made their investment; they were not established unilaterally but by the agreement between Argentina and the Claimants; and they existed and were enforceable by law. Like any rational investor, the Claimants attached great importance to the tariff regime stipulated in the Concession Contract and the regulatory framework. Indeed, their ability to make a profit was crucially dependent on it. The importance of the tariff regime was underscored even before the bidding took place, as shown *inter alia* by the redrafting of Articles 18.11.4.1 and 18.11.5.1 of the Original Bidding Rules relating to extraordinary tariff revisions to take into account changes in financial costs and a legal modification of the exchange rate parity provided by the Convertibility Law. These revisions were later included in the Concession Contract, a document which certainly embodies the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations, as well as those of Argentina. In view of the central role that the Concession Contract and legal framework placed in establishing the Concession and the care and attention that Argentina devoted to the creation of that framework, the Claimants\u2019 expectations that Argentina would respect the Concession Contract throughout the thirty-year life of the Concession was legitimate, reasonable, and justified. It was in reliance on that legal framework that the Claimants invested substantial funds in Argentina. And Argentina certainly recognized at the time it granted the Concession to the Claimants that without such belief in the reliability and stability of the legal framework the Claimants - indeed no investor - would ever have agreed to invest in the water and sewage system of Buenos Aires.\n\n**1. Argentina\u2019s Measures Altering the Investment Framework**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n232.\n\nArgentina\u2019s persistent refusal to revise the tariff in accordance with the legal framework and the Concession Contract frustrated the expectations of the Claimants. Indeed, ETOSS, the regulatory authority, acknowledged that fact in its letter of 14 February 2002 to AASA when it wrote: \"The Law 25,561, therefore, modifies the terms of the Annual Revisions and of the Extraordinary Revision which, had this [the Law] not been passed, would have applied under the terms of clause 3.3 of Res. SRNyDS No 602/99, under clause 11.11.5.1 third paragraph of the Concession Contract and clause 3.6 of the Agreement approved by Decree 1167/97, by virtue of the modification of the parity 1$ = 1US$.\"166\n\nExh. C-91\n\n233.\n\nBeyond the specific words and commitments of the regulatory framework and the Concession Contract, the Claimants, having entered into a thirty-year relationship with Argentina, were entitled to expect that Argentina would manage that relationship in a cooperative manner, that is to say, that they would \"work together\" so that the relationship was mutually advantageous. Indeed, Article 5.1 of the Concession Contract required the Concessionaire and ETOSS \"...to use all means at their disposal to establish and maintain a fluid relationship that facilitates the performance of this Concession Contract.\"167 In effect, the legal framework seemed to envision a relationship between the Concessionaire and the Argentine authorities that would be a concrete example of the economic cooperation that the BITs sought to promote. During the first eight years, such a cooperative relationship seemed to prevail. With the economic crisis and subsequent changes in government and in policies, that cooperative relationship clearly evaporated and all signs of fluidity disappeared. Indeed, as is further discussed below, the Argentine authorities demonstrated extreme rigidity in their dealings with AASA and the Claimants.\n\nExh. C-44 \"El Concesionario y el Ente Regulador deben arbitrar todos los medios a su alcance para establecer y mantener una relaci\u00f3n fluida que facilite cumplimento de este Contrato de Concesi\u00f3n.\"\n\n234.\n\nThe argument that the Claimants could not reasonably expect that in the context of an economic and financial crisis Argentina would not be led to act as it did in the light of the history of economic instability of the country is not compelling. It was largely because of the country\u2019s history of instability that the Claimants insisted on incorporating the specific clauses on extraordinary tariff adjustment reviews mentioned above. Moreover, a country cannot persuasively allege its historic instability to avoid its responsibility to foreign investors when it specifically endeavored to remove this disincentive to foreign investment by providing specific assurances in a Concession Contract and in bilateral investment treaties. Indeed, one can say without exaggeration that Argentina\u2019s various actions toward foreign investors in the 1990s were intended to overcome its negative economic history in the minds of the international financial and business community.\n\n235.\n\nMoreover, there is strong evidence that Argentina might have employed more flexible means that would have protected both its interests and those of the Claimants. For example, if Argentina\u2019s concern was to avoid an increase in tariffs during a time of crisis, it might have relieved AASA, at least temporarily, of investment commitments that were placing a crippling burden on the Concession so long as tariffs did not increase. If Argentina\u2019s concern was to protect the poor from increased tariffs, it might have allowed tariff increases for other consumers while applying a social tariff or a subsidy to the poor, a solution clearly permitted by the regulatory framework. There is evidence that governmental agencies were among the consumers with the largest unpaid invoices owing to AASA. Argentina might have taken measures to assure that its own governmental organizations paid their legitimate debts to AASA. All of these options were suggested to the Argentine authorities and all were rejected. In short, there appears to have been very little desire or effort after the outbreak of the crisis for Argentina to \"work together\" with AASA and the Claimants. Once the crisis had ended and economic growth returned to the Argentine economy, the government showed no greater willingness to find a way to work together with AASA and the Claimants. While Argentina seems to suggest that there was nothing else that it could have done in its relationship with AASA and the Claimants, the Tribunal is not persuaded that an amicable solution could not have been reached.\n\n236.\n\nIn interpreting the concept of fair and equitable, the Tribunal must also bear in mind that the Concession by its terms was subject to the regulatory authority of the Argentine State, which had a reasonable right to regulate. Thus in interpreting the meaning of fair and equitable treatment to be accorded to investors, the Tribunal must balance the legitimate and reasonable expectations of the Claimants with Argentina\u2019s right to regulate the provision of a vital public service. As the *Saluka* tribunal stated, \"[t]he determination of a breach of Article 3.1 by the Czech Republic [which required fair and equitable treatment of investors] therefore requires a weighing of the Claimant\u2019s legitimate and reasonable expectations on the one hand and the Respondent\u2019s legitimate regulatory interests on the other.\"168 What this means in the context of the present cases is that the legitimate and reasonable expectations of the investors in AASA must have included the expectation that the Argentine government would exercise its legitimate regulatory interests with respect to the AASA Concession throughout the period of thirty years and in response to unpredictable circumstances that might arise during that time.\n\n*Supra* note 96, at para. 306.\n\n237.\n\nThere is no question that under the legal framework Argentina had the right to regulate the activities of the Concession concerning a broad range of matters, including the tariff structure, investment standards, and performance. But AASA and the Claimants, as participants in any regulated industry, had the legitimate expectation that the Argentine authorities would exercise that regulatory authority and discretion within the rules of the detailed legal framework that Argentina had established for the Concession. But when faced with the crisis, Argentina refused to do this. It still refused once the crisis had abated. Indeed, it enacted various measures directing the regulatory authorities not to respect important elements of the legal framework. Such actions were outside the scope of its legitimate right to regulate and in effect constituted an abuse of regulatory discretion.169\n\nExh. C-85, C-90, C-91, C-97, C-101, C-108\n\n238.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, this Tribunal finds that Argentina\u2019s persistent and rigid refusal to revise the tariff in accordance with the Concession Contract and the regulatory framework, particularly once the crisis had abated and economic growth returned, violated its commitments under the three BITs to treat the Claimants\u2019 investments fairly and equitably.\n\n**2. Argentina\u2019s Measures to Renegotiate the Concession**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Claimants also assert that Argentina denied them fair and equitable treatment when it forced them to engage in a renegotiation of the Concession. The Claimants allege that they never accepted the renegotiation process unilaterally imposed by the Argentine government in 2002, and that they could not oppose the process. Argentina, on the other hand, argues that AASA participated and indeed had requested previous renegotiation before the crisis, that it agreed to participate in the renegotiation process begun in 2002, and that it did not object to that process.\n\n240.\n\nThere is reason to believe that AASA did willingly participate at first in the renegotiation process and that, while it might have objected to the process, in fact it did not. However, the Tribunal does not believe that these factors override the argument that taken as a whole Argentina\u2019s treatment of the Claimants during that process was unfair and inequitable or that by participating in the process without objection the Claimants somehow waived their right under the treaty to fair and equitable treatment by Argentina. Indeed, if AASA had refused to participate in the renegotiation process launched by the Argentine government, AASA might have been accused of failing to meet the requirements of Article 5.1 of the Concession Contract, quoted above, requiring parties \"...to use all means at [its] disposal to establish and maintain a fluid relationship that facilitates the performance of [the] Concession Contract.\"\n\n241.\n\nIn examining the nature of the renegotiation process, the Tribunal finds that it differs significantly from the various revisions or renegotiation processes provided by the Concession legal framework and from the Concession renegotiations and revisions that had previously taken place in 1994 and 1997-1999. For one thing it had an extremely forceful character quite different from what the legal framework provided and from the way previous negotiations had taken place. The forceful character of the renegotiation process is apparent *inter alia* from the following elements referred to by the Claimants: (i) Resolution No. 38/02 of the MoE, of 10 April 2002, prohibiting all regulatory agencies, including ETOSS, from taking any measures that directly or indirectly affected tariffs of any entities subject to their regulatory supervision until the end of the renegotiation period170; (ii) the letter from the Renegotiation Commission to AASA, of 2 April 2003, attaching the first proposal for a Transitory Agreement, which did not reflect the issues discussed during the previous 14 months of renegotiation and granted AASA only five days to conduct its analysis and respond171; (iii) Decree 311/03, dated 4 July 2003, by which Argentina changed the rules of the renegotiation process, creating a new entity, UNIREN, in charge of the renegotiation and effectively recommenced the renegotiation process from the beginning172; (iv) ETOSS Resolution 86/03, dated 6 August 2003, by which Argentina forced AASA to set up the *Fideicomiso* and transfer to it the amounts correspond'ng to the 3.9% tariff increases applied by AASA in 2001 and 2002, and which threatened the call of the Performance Bond and the imposition of penalties in the event of AASA\u2019s failure to comply173; (v) Law No 25,790, dated 22 October 2003, providing that the decisions adopted by the Executive Power in the process of renegotiating public contracts were \"not limited or conditioned\" by the provisions of their regulatory frameworks, so that Argentina could completely derogate or ignore them, and that the jurisdiction of the regulators on tariff reviews could only be exercised subject to the renegotiation process.174\n\nExh. C-97.\n\nExh. C-124.\n\nExh. C-127.\n\nExh. C-130.\n\nExh. C-134.\n\n242.\n\nIn light of the severity of these measures, the Tribunal questions whether in reality the process thus established constituted a \"renegotiation\" in reality or whether it was actually an effort to compel changes in the Concession under that label. The essence of a renegotiation is that the parties freely agree to revise or amend an existing agreement. As the tribunal in *Enron* stated: \"[a]ny process of negotiation requires of course that the parties genuinely agree on the outcome and this cannot be imposed or forced upon one party\"175 It appears that Argentina sought to structure the \"renegotiation\" process in such a way as to severely limit or indeed curtail the contractual freedom of AASA in order to arrive at a predetermined result desired by Argentina. In the opinion of the Tribunal, such a process cannot in fairness be said to constitute a renegotiation as that term is generally understood. It was certainly not the kind of renegotiation or revision process that AASA and the Claimants were led to expect by the legal framework of the Concession and the events of the first eight years of the Concession.\n\n*Enron, supra* note 92, at para. 186.\n\n243.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that Argentina\u2019s treatment of AASA and the Claimants during the renegotiation process that began in 2002 was a breach of its promise of fair and equitable treatment under the three BITs in question. It finds support for this conclusion in the decision in *BG Group* v. *Argentina,* in which the Tribunal noted, in this regard, that \"Argentina also breached the international minimum standard in relation to UNIREN\u2019s authorization to renegotiate the Government agreements with public service providers. As stated at paragraph 80 above, the Emergency Law and subsequent legislation were enacted to promote a new deal with the licensees, impeding the application and execution of the original Regulatory Framework. Also, Argentina enhanced the violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT by formalizing in Resolution 308/02 and Decree 1090/02 the exclusion from the imposed renegotiation process of any licensee that sought redress in an arbitral or other forum\".176\n\n*BG Group, supra* note 132, at para. 309. See also *LG&E, supra* note 78, at paras. 136-139.\n\n**3. Argentina\u2019s Termination of the Concession**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nArgentina\u2019s termination of the Concession was abrupt, and its reasons for such action are not completely clear. It alleged that high levels of nitrates in the water were a justification for the termination. Argentina not only ended the Concession but it also demanded payment of the Performance Bond posted by the Claimants to guarantee AASA\u2019s performance on ground that high nitrate levels in the water justified payment as a failure of satisfactory performance. While the regulatory authorities had previously expressed their concern to AASA about high nitrate levels, Argentina first opened a formal investigation of the matter only on 17 March 2006. Four days later, on 21 March 2006, before that proceeding could come to a proper conclusion according to the legal framework, Argentina abruptly terminated the Concession for fault of the Concessionaire. The shortness of time between the commencement of the investigation and the abrupt cancellation of the Concession raises possible inferences that the nitrate issue may have been a mere pretext for an action that the Argentine authorities had already decided to take.\n\n245.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal is not unmindful of the difficult position in which Argentina found itself as a result of the Claimants\u2019 own request to terminate the Concession made the previous September. Argentina\u2019s refusal at that time was no doubt prompted in part by the fact that while it had the ultimate responsibility to provide vital water and waste water services to the population of greater Buenos Aires, it was not then in a position to actually assume operational responsibility for those services. At that time and in those circumstances, it was not beyond the realm of possibility from Argentina\u2019s perspective that the Claimants might abruptly quit the country, leaving an unprepared Argentine government to provide a basic service to nearly ten million people in a large metropolitan area. It is likely that Argentina felt that it had to prepare for that eventuality while still causing AASA to provide the needed service under the Concession. Thus, to a certain extent it may be said that AASA\u2019s request to terminate the Concession may have been a factor in prompting Argentina\u2019s decision to act suddenly to terminate the Concession itself a few months later. At the same time, it must be noted that it was the actions of the Argentine authorities in refusing to revise the tariff according to the legal framework and in forcing a renegotiation of the Concession - actions which this Tribunal has judged to be a violation of the fair and equitable standard - that put the Claimants in the position where they felt that had to give up the Concession.\n\n246.\n\nArgentina\u2019s termination of the Concession was done pursuant to its contract with AASA. This Tribunal, as stated above, has no jurisdiction to judge whether Argentina\u2019s termination of the Concession breached the Concession Contract. The alleged high nitrate levels in the water may indeed have been an unjustified pretext. Nonetheless, there is evidence in the record that such high levels may have existed. Whether Argentina breached the Concession Contract by terminating it is a matter for the dispute resolution procedures provided in that contract. In viewing the circumstances as a whole and the situation that existed at the time of the termination, the Tribunal finds that the record is insufficient to establish that Argentina\u2019s treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investments in terminating the Concession attained the level of violating the fair and equitable standards required by the three applicable BITs.\n\nE. *The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions*\n-------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Argentina\u2019s actions in refusing to revise the tariff according to the legal framework of the Concession and in pursing the forced renegotiation of the Concession Contract contrary to that legal framework violated its obligations under the applicable BITs to accord the investments of the Claimants fair and equitable treatment. For purposes of the forthcoming determination of the legal consequences of such breaches, the Tribunal further concludes that the first abovementioned breach took place on 6 January 2002, date of the enactment of the Emergency Law, which was the first of a series of measures frustrating the investors\u2019 legitimately protected expectations, whereas the second abovementioned breach took place on 10 April 2002, date of the adoption of MoE Resolution No. 38/02, which was the first of a series of measures making the renegotiation process an unfair and inequitable one.\n\n248.\n\nA State may violate an investment treaty\u2019s fair and equitable treatment standard in many ways and with many differing consequences. The majority\u2019s finding in the present cases that Argentina\u2019s various actions violated the fair and equitable treatment standard by frustrating the Claimants\u2019 legitimate and reasonable expectations is by no means a rejection of the conclusions of our esteemed colleague Professor Nikken in his separate opinion to the effect that Argentina failed to exercise due diligence in certain elements of its treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investments. The majority agrees that Argentina failed to exercise due diligence, as that concept is generally understood, and that such failure resulted in a violation of the treaties\u2019 fair and equitable treatment standard. As discussed earlier in this Decision, the majority of the Tribunal finds that Argentina\u2019s actions also frustrated the Claimants\u2019 legitimate expectations and it has concluded that it is more appropriate to base its decision on that rationale.\n\n**IX. Argentina\u2019s Defense of Necessity**\n----------------------------------------\n\nA. *The Nature of the Defense*\n------------------------------\n\n249.\n\nArgentina argues that even if certain of its actions may have breached individual BIT provisions applicable to these cases it is absolved of liability by virtue of the defense of necessity under customary international law. Both the Claimants and Argentina agree that the current state of the law on the defense of necessity is reflected in Article 25 of the International Law Commission\u2019s (ILC) Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001), which provides as follows:\n\n**Article 25**\n\n**Necessity**\n\n1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:\n\na) Is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril; and\n\n(b) Does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.\n\n2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:\n\n(a) The international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or\n\n(b) The State has contributed to the situation of necessity.\n\nIt is to be noted that the ILC Articles do not define the nature of the necessity defense in positive terms. Rather they limit themselves to stating the situations in which the defense of necessity may *not* be raised.\n\nB. *Argentina\u2019s Position*\n-------------------------\n\n250.\n\nArgentina argues that it took the actions it did affecting the Claimants\u2019 investments out of the necessity of dealing with the financial crisis in order to safeguard essential interests of the State. It alleges that the crisis did not result from its own actions but from the crises that had previously struck other parts of the world, namely the financial and economic emergencies in Indonesia, Mexico, Brazil, and Russia. In order to protect its essential interests, it had to take the various measures that it did and that no other means of protecting those interests were available to it.\n\n251.\n\nIn support of its contentions, it cites the Decision on Liability in *LG&E v. Argentina* in which the tribunal accepted Argentina\u2019s defense of necessity, stating:\n\nThe essential interests of the Argentine State were threatened in December 2001. It faced an extremely serious threat to its existence, its political and economic survival, to the possibility of maintaining its essential services in operation and to the preservation of its internal peace. There is no serious evidence in the record that Argentina contributed to the crisis resulting in the state of necessity. In these circumstances an economic recovery package was the only means to respond to the crisis. Although there may have been a number of ways to draft the economic recovery plan, the evidence before the Tribunal demonstrates that an across-the-board response was necessary, and the tariffs on public utilities had to be addressed.177\n\n*Supra* note 78 at para. 257.\n\n252.\n\nArgentina argues that it adopted the measures in order to safeguard the human right to water of the inhabitants of the country. Because of its importance to the life and health of the population, Argentina states that water cannot be treated as an ordinary commodity. Because of the fundamental role of water in sustaining life and health and the consequent human right to water, it maintains that in judging the conformity of governmental actions with treaty obligations this Tribunal must grant Argentina a broader margin of discretion in the present cases than in cases involving other commodities and services. In order to judge whether a treaty provision has been violated, for example the provision on fair and equitable treatment, Argentina argues that this Tribunal must take account of the context in which Argentina acted and that the human right to water informs that context.\n\nC. *The Claimants\u2019Position*\n---------------------------\n\n253.\n\nThe Claimants reject Argentina\u2019s defense of necessity as not being grounded in either law or fact. According to the Claimants\u2019 interpretation of the ILC Articles and customary international law, three conditions must be present before a State may invoke necessity as a defense to liability for an international obligation: 1) the possibility of invoking the defense must not be excluded by the international obligation that the State is seeking to avoid; 2) the State must not have contributed to the situation of necessity; and 3) the State\u2019s measures in question must have been the only way for the state to safeguard an essential interest against a grave or imminent risk. Moreover, the Claimants remind the Tribunal of the admonition of the International Court of Justice in the *Gahcikovo-Nagymaros Project Case* that Article 25 \"...is a most exceptional remedy subject to the very strict conditions because otherwise it would open the door to elude any international obligation.\"178\n\n*Gabcikovo-Nagymaros Project* (Hungary/Slovakia) Judgment, 25 September 1997, ICJ at paras. 51-52.\n\n254.\n\nClaimants further argue that in fact Argentina satisfies none of the three conditions necessary to invoke the defense of necessity. They assert that the BITs in question were intended to protect investors in times of economic difficulties and thus excluded the invocation of the doctrine of necessity. Secondly, they argue that by its policies and actions Argentina contributed to the economic crisis that struck the country, thus further preventing it from raising the defense of necessity. And finally, they assert that the measures Argentina took to deal with the crisis and of which the Claimants complain were not the only means to safeguard an essential interest of the country from a grave or imminent peril. Indeed it argues that while the crisis was severe it did not compromise the existence of the State, as Argentina argues, and did not constitute a threat to an essential interest. Moreover the crisis was not a grave and imminent peril as evidenced by the fact that the Argentine economy began to recover in the second quarter of 2002. Further, the Claimants assert that there were a variety of other measures that Argentina might have taken with respect to the Concession, such a cross subsidies, temporary relief of AASA\u2019s investment obligations, or differentiated freezing of certain tariffs among different categories of consumers, which would have allowed it to deal with the crisis and still respect its commitments to AASA\u2019s investors.\n\n255.\n\nWith respect to the role of human rights as argued by Argentina and the *amici curiae,* to which the Tribunal will refer below, the Claimants respond that they have never questioned the right of the population to water. They point out that Argentina\u2019s decision to privatize the Buenos Aires water service and to promote the creation of AASA was precisely to make that right more effective for larger numbers of Argentine inhabitants as the service was expanded through AASA\u2019s efforts. They further argue that it was the Argentine government\u2019s actions during the crisis, not AASA and the Claimants, that put the population\u2019s right to water at risk since AASA was denied the means, as promised by the Concession\u2019s regulatory framework, which compromised water and sewage service quality. Finally, the Claimants argue that what is at issue in these cases is whether Argentina breached its legal commitments under the BITs and that human rights law is irrelevant to that determination.\n\nD. *Amicus Curiae Submissions*\n------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal also received the benefit of an *amicus curiae* submission. dated 4 April 2007, filed by five non-governmental organizations179 that further developed the relationship of the human rights law to water and to the issues in this case. That submission pointed out that human rights law recognizes the right to water and its close linkages with other human rights, including the right to life, health, housing, and an adequate standard of living. Human rights law, the NGOs contend in their submission, required that Argentina adopt measures to ensure access to water by the population, including physical and economic access, and that its actions in confronting the crisis fully conformed to human rights law. Since human rights law provides a rationale for the crisis measures, they argue that this Tribunal should consider that rationale in interpreting and applying the provisions of the BITs in question.\n\nAs noted in para. 13, *supra,* the five NGOs were Asociaci\u00f3n Civil por la Igualdad y la Justicia, Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales, Center for International Environmental Law, Consumidores Libres Cooperativa Ltda. de Provisi\u00f3n de Servicios de Acci\u00f3n Comunitaria, and Uni\u00f3n de Usuarios y Consumidores.\n\n*E. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis and Conclusions*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n257.\n\nThe crisis into which Argentina fell in 2001-2003 was undoubtedly one of the most severe in its history. It was characterized by extreme social disturbance, riots, violence, and almost total breakdown of the political system. Evidence in the record in the present cases clearly shows its severity. Previous tribunals deciding disputes arising out of the crisis have also recognized and underscored its severity. For example, the tribunal in *CMS v. Argentina,* which would ultimately deny Argentina\u2019s plea of necessity, stated that it was \"convinced that the crisis was indeed severe and the argument that nothing happened is not tenable.\"180 The tribunal in *LG&E* v. *Argentina* found that \"... from 1 December 2001 until 26 April 2003, Argentina was in a period of crisis during which it was necessary to enact measures to maintain public order and to protect its essential security interests,\"181 describing the conditions in the country at the time as \"devastating.\"182\n\nPara. 320.\n\nPara. 226.\n\nPara. 237.\n\n258.\n\nThe severity of a crisis, no matter the degree, is not sufficient to allow a plea of necessity to relieve a state of its treaty obligations. The customary international law, as restated by Article 25 of the ILC Articles, quoted above, imposes additional strict conditions. The reason of course is that given the frequency of crises and emergencies that nations, large and small, face from time to time, to allow them to escape their treaty obligations would threaten the very fabric of international law and indeed the stability of the system of international relations. It is for this reason that the International Court of Justice, other tribunals, and scholars have warned of the defense\u2019s exceptional nature and of the strict conditions surrounding its application.\n\n259.\n\nArticle 25 imposes four conditions on the application of the defense of necessity. The first two relate to the nature of the State\u2019s act in violation of its obligations. Thus such act (1) must be the only way for it to safeguard an essential interest from grave and imminent peril and (2) must not seriously impair an essential interest of the State toward which the obligation exists or toward the international community as a whole. The other two conditions relate to the nature of the international obligation affected by such act and the contribution of such state in causing the situation of necessity. Thus, the third condition is that the obligation in question must not exclude the possibility of the defense of necessity and the fourth condition is that the State must not have contributed to the situation of necessity. We examine each of these four conditions within the context of the present cases.\n\n260.\n\n*The first condition for the defense of necessity: Only way to safeguard an essential interest.* The provision of water and sewage services to the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires certainly was vital to the health and well-being of nearly ten million people and was therefore an essential interest of the Argentine State. On the other hand, the Tribunal is not convinced that the only way that Argentina could satisfy that essential interest was by adopting measures that would subsequently violate the treaty rights of the Claimants\u2019 investments to fair and equitable treatment. As discussed above, Argentina could have attempted to apply more flexible means to assure the continuation of the water and sewage services to the people of Buenos Aires and at the same time respected its obligations of fair and equitable treatment. The two were by no means mutually exclusive. Thus the Tribunal finds that Argentina has not satisfied the first condition for the defense of necessity.\n\n261.\n\n*The second condition for the defense of necessity: Non-impairment of other States\u2019 essential interests.* In failing to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment, Argentina may have injured the Claimants\u2019 interests, but it is difficult to see how Argentina\u2019s actions impaired an essential interest of France, Spain, the United Kingdom, or the international community. The Tribunal therefore finds that Argentina has satisfied the second condition for the defense of necessity.\n\n262.\n\n*The third condition for the defense of necessity: Treaty obligation does not exclude necessity defense.* The texts of the three BITs in question do no specifically exclude or allow the admissibility of a defense of necessity. The *LG&E* case, upon which Argentina relies, involved the application of the U.S.-Argentina BIT which contained a clause stating that nothing in the treaty precluded a Contracting Party from taking \"...measures necessary for the maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of own essential security interests\"183 None of the three BITs applicable to the present cases contains such a \"non-precluded measures clause.\"184 Argentina and the *amicus curiae* submissions received by the Tribunal suggest that Argentina\u2019s human rights obligations to assure its population the right to water somehow trumps its obligations under the BITs and that the existence of the human right to water also implicitly gives Argentina the authority to take actions in disregard of its BIT obligations. The Tribunal does not find a basis for such a conclusion either in the BITs or international law. Argentina is subject to both international obligations, *i.e.* human rights *and* treaty obligation, and must respect both of them equally. Under the circumstances of these cases, Argentina\u2019s human rights obligations and its investment treaty obligations are not inconsistent, contradictory, or mutually exclusive. Thus, as discussed above, Argentina could have respected both types of obligations. Viewing each treaty as a whole, the Tribunal does not find that any of them excluded the defense of necessity. Therefore Argentina must be deemed to have satisfied the third condition for the defense of necessity.\n\nArticle XI.\n\nSee WW Burke-White & A von Staden, *Investment Protection in Extra-Ordinary Times: The Interpretation and Application of Non-Precluded Measures Provisions in Bilateral Investment Treaties,* 48 Virginia J of Inti L 307 (2008).\n\n263.\n\n*The fourth condition for the defense of necessity: Non-contribution to the situation of necessity.* To invoke the defense of necessity, a state must not have contributed to its situation of necessity. The operative word of this condition is \"contribute\", not \"cause\" or \"create.\" Thus, the fact that other actors, besides the state in question, may have contributed to that state\u2019s situation of necessity does not automatically mean that such state has not contributed to it. The Commentary to the ILC Articles makes it clear that such contribution must \"...be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral.\" Thus, an important question is whether Argentina contributed to the crisis of 2001-2003 to an extent sufficiently substantial to rule out a necessity defense in compliance with international law. This being said, the Claimants in their pleadings viewed the crisis as created primarily by endogamous factors, primarily the economic policies of various Argentine governments. The Respondent, on the other hand, portrayed the crisis as caused by exogenous factors, primarily the various global crises, such as the one which struck Russia in 1999.\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors contributed to the Argentine crisis at the beginning of this century. Among Argentina\u2019s contributing factors to the crisis were excessive public spending, inefficient tax collection, delays in responding to the early signs of the crisis, insufficient efforts at developing an export market, and internal political dissension and problems inhibiting effective policy making. In listing these factors, the Tribunal does not by any means intend to minimize the substantial external forces that were buffeting the Argentine economy. Its intent is to show that Argentina itself contributed to its situation of emergency. In this regard, this Tribunal must agree with the tribunal in *CMS v. Argentina,* which stated that \"[t]he issue, however, is whether the contribution to the crisis by Argentina has or has not been sufficiently substantial. The Tribunal, when reviewing the circumstances of present dispute, must conclude that this was the case. The crisis was not of the making of one particular administration and found its roots in the earlier crisis of the 1980s and evolving governmental policies of the 1990s that reached a zenith in 2002 and thereafter. Therefore, the Tribunal observes that government policies and their shortcomings significantly contributed to the crisis and the emergency and while exogenous factors did fuel additional difficulties they do not exempt the Respondent from its responsibility in the matter.\"185 One might also suggest if external, global factors alone had created Argentina\u2019s crisis, it is surprising that other countries did not experience a crisis of equal magnitude at the time.\n\nPara. 329.\n\n265.\n\nIn sum then, the Tribunal denies Argentina\u2019s plea of the defense of necessity against the Claimants\u2019 claims of BIT violations because Argentina\u2019s measures in violation of the BITs were not the only means to satisfy its essential interests and because Argentina itself contributed to the emergency situation that it was facing in 2001-2003.\n\n**X. The BIT Provisions on Armed Conflict and State of Emergency**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nArgentina finds a further defense to liability for failure to respect the general treatment provisions discussed above in the special BIT provisions in the Argentina-France and the Argentina-U.K. BITs with respect to emergency situations that may arise in the territory of a Contracting Party. Specifically, Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT states:\n\nInvestors of either Contracting Party whose investments have suffered losses as a result of war or any other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency or uprising in the territory or maritime zone of the other Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Party treatment which is no less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of the most-favored nation.\n\nSimilarly, Article 4 (entitled \"Compensation for Losses\") of the Argentina-U.K. BIT also provides:\n\nInvestors of one Contracting Party whose investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer losses owing to war or other armed conflict, revolution, a state of national emergency, revolt, insurrection or riot or resulting from arbitrary action by the authorities in the territory of the latter Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter Contracting Party treatment, as regards restitution, indemnification, compensation or other settlement, no less favourable than that which the latter Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to investors of any third State. Resulting payments shall be freely transferable.\n\nAlthough the Argentina-Spain BIT does not contain a similar provision, Argentina argues that the above-quoted treaty provisions, since they are included in so many BITs, constitute customary international law and therefore the principles that they embody are also applicable to the Spanish Claimant AGBAR.\n\n267.\n\nThe essence of Argentina\u2019s argument in this respect is that the above-quoted BIT provisions constitute a special regime applicable to investors in situations of emergency and that in such emergency situations the only treatment that Argentina owes to investors is to treat them no less favorably than it treats its own investors or investors from any third country. Argentina argues that during the time of the actions of which AASA\u2019s investors complain, Argentina was in a state of emergency. Therefore its only duty under the BITs was to treat the Claimants\u2019 investments no less favorably than it treated investments from Argentina or from any third country. Since the Claimants have not proven the existence of any such discrimination, Argentina argues that its treatment of the investor have violated none of the treaty provisions.\n\n268.\n\nThe Claimants reject Argentina\u2019s argument on this point. They assert first that the treaty provisions upon which Argentina relies contain no exculpatory language that absolves Argentina from liability that it may incur from breaching other provisions of the treaty. In support, they cite the language of the *CMS v. Argentina* tribunal, which considered the same issue:\n\nThe plain meaning of the Article [Article IV(3)] is to provide a floor treatment for the investor in the context of the measures adopted in respect of the losses suffered in the emergency, not different from that applied to nationals or other foreign investors. The Article does not derogate from the Treaty rights but rather ensures that any measures directed at offsetting or minimizing losses will be applied in a non-discriminatory manner.\"186\n\n*Supra* note 86 at para. 375.\n\n269.\n\nThe Claimants therefore argue that the above-quoted BIT provisions apply only in situations where: (a) an investor has suffered damage as a result of armed conflict or similar circumstances; but (b) that investor does not have a specific entitlement to reparation under another provision of the Treaty or customary international law; and (c) another investor, whether domestic or foreign, has been granted reparation, whether by operation of another treaty, domestic law, or simply on a discretionary basis. In short, by their terms and structure these BIT provisions create an additional legal cause for compensation; they do not establish an excuse for measures that otherwise breach the BITs. Moreover, as a matter of treaty interpretation, the Claimants point out that the clear intent of the BIT provisions is to apply to physical damage caused by war, revolution or civil disturbance, not to injuries caused by a state\u2019s regulatory measures.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot agree with Argentina\u2019s interpretation of the above-quoted BIT provisions. The clear meaning of those provisions is to impose on Contracting Parties an obligation of equality of treatment of investments for losses resulting from war, civil disturbance, and national emergencies. The provision contains no reference whatsoever to other obligations imposed by the BITs on Contracting Parties, let alone to provide for an exemption from such obligations. Had the Contracting Parties, after carefully negotiating a complex set of legal obligations to protect and promote investments, intended that such obligations would not apply in times of war, civil disturbance, or national emergency, they certainly would have so stated specifically. Indeed, in many other BITs, contracting parties have included exception provisions to provide for limited exemptions from BIT obligations in particular situations. The Contracting Parties of the BITs in question in these cases could also have done so if they had wished, but they did not.\n\n271.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the above-quoted BIT provisions mean what they say: they impose on Argentina an obligation of equality of treatment with respect to investment losses sustained as a result of war, civil disturbance, and national emergency. They do not exempt Argentina from its other treaty obligations under the BITs. The Tribunal therefore rejects Argentina\u2019s interpretation of the applicable BIT provisions and its claimed defense to its liability for violating such other provisions.\n\n**XI. Further Procedure; Cost and Expenses**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nThe Tribunal has decided to render a decision on liability before arriving at an award on damages. It has chosen to adopt this procedure for reasons of judicial economy. Given the complexity of this case and the extraordinarily voluminous nature of the record, the Tribunal by rendering a decision on liability now and thereby defining the scope of its investigation with respect to a determination of damages will be able more efficiently to define the mission of the independent expert that will assist the Tribunal in this determination.\n\n273.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that a bifurcation of the merits phase of an ICSID case into determination of liability and a determination of damages is not common. On the other hand, the ICSID Rules do not preclude such an approach. Indeed, Article 44 of the ICSID Convention, which this Tribunal invoked to permit an amicus curiae submission and to allow the withdrawal of AASA as a party to this dispute, specifically states: \"If any question of procedure which is not covered by this Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed upon by the parties, the Tribunal shall decide the question.\" The Tribunal relies on Article 44 in deciding on bifurcating the merits phase of this case for the reasons outlined above, concluded that\n\n274.\n\nThe Tribunal has specifically asked the advice of the parties with respect to the selection and role of an independent expert on damages in this case, and the parties have responded in the post-hearing submissions. The Tribunal will take account of the parties\u2019 views in carrying out the damages phase of this case.\n\n275.\n\nBecause important procedural matters remain to take place in these cases, the Tribunal defers any decision on costs and expenses until the completion of the damages phase of these proceedings.\n\n**XII. The Tribunal\u2019s Conclusions with respect to the Respondent\u2019s Liability**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nAfter examining the respective cases of the Claimants and the Respondent, the Tribunal:\n\na. Rejects the Claimants\u2019 claim that the Respondent has directly or indirectly expropriated the investments of the Claimants;\n\nb. Rejects the Claimants\u2019 claim that the Respondent has denied the Claimants\u2019 investments full protection and security;\n\nc. Finds that the Respondent has denied the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment;\n\nd. Rejects the Respondent\u2019s defense of necessity to the claims of the Claimants; and\n\ne. Rejects the Respondent\u2019s defense that Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT and Article 4 of the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT, as well as international law, exempts Argentina from its BIT obligations during times of emergency;\n\nf. The decision on damages for breach of fair and equitable treatment and the decision on costs are deferred to the Tribunal\u2019s award on damages;\n\ng.

Background of the Cases**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Summary of the Facts**\n---------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn July 30, 2010, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Liability in which it found that the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\" or \"the Respondent\") had breached its obligations under three bilateral investment treaties by denying the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment as required by the applicable treaties. The investments of Claimants Suez and Vivendi Universal S.A. (\"Vivendi\"), both incorporated in France, are protected by the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between France and the Argentine Republic (the \"France-Argentina BIT\")1, the investments of Claimant Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. (\"AGBAR\"), incorporated in Spain, are protected by the 1991 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain (the \"Argentina-Spain BIT\"),2 and the investments of AWG Group Ltd (\"AWG\"), incorporated in the United Kingdom, are protected by the 1990 Bilateral Investment Treaty between the Argentine Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (the \"Argentina-UK BIT\").3\n\nAccord entre le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise et le Gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique Argentine sur l\u2019encouragement et la protection r\u00e9ciproques des investissements (Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of France for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments), signed on July 3.1991 and in force since March 3.1993; 1728 UNTS 298.\n\nAcuerdo para la promoci\u00f3n y protecci\u00f3n rec\u00edprocas de inversiones entre el Reino de Espa\u00f1a y la Rep\u00fablica Argentina (Agreement on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments between the Kingdom of Spain and the Argentine Republic), signed in Buenos Aires on October 3, 1991 and in force since September 28.1992; 1699 UNTS 202.\n\nAcuerdo entre el Gobierno del Reino Unido de Gran Breta\u00f1a e Irlanda del Norte y el Gobierno de la Rep\u00fablica Argentina para la Promoci\u00f3n y la Protecci\u00f3n de Inversiones (Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Protection of Investments), signed in London, December 11, 1990, and in force as of February 19, 1993.\n\n2.\n\nIn 1993, the Claimants had made investments in a concession for water distribution and waste water treatment services in the city of Buenos Aires and some surrounding municipalities. For the purpose of operating the Concession, the Claimants formed an Argentine company, Aguas Argentinas S.A. (\"AASA\"), with an initial capitalization of USD 120 million, in which they held shares. As required by the applicable regulatory framework and the thirty-year Concession Contract between AASA and the Argentine government, AASA entered into a management contract with Claimant Suez, specifying its duties as Concession Operator and providing for its related compensation. Under the terms of the Concession Contract and the regulatory framework, the Claimants were to make substantial investments to improve and develop the water distribution and waste water treatment systems entrusted to AASA in return for which they would be compensated by the fees and tariffs paid by consumers to AASA over the thirty-year life of the Concession. In addition to their equity contributions to AASA, the Claimants also guaranteed certain loans made to AASA by three multilateral lending institutions: the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The Decision on Liability describes in some detail the events, and particularly the bidding process leading up to the granting of the Concession (\u00b6\u00b6 26-34), the regulatory framework governing the Concession (\u00b6\u00b6 66-126), and the various actions of AASA, the Argentine Government, and the Claimants during the first eight years (1993-2001) of the Concession (\u00b6\u00b6 35-40).4\n\nThe July 30, 2010 Decision on Liability and the April 3, 2006 Decision on Jurisdiction issued by the Tribunal in these cases are integral parts of this Award.\n\n3.\n\nBeginning in the year 2000, Argentina began to experience significant economic difficulties that would have serious consequences for the country, its people, and its investors, both foreign and national. Indeed, the country would within a short time plunge into the worst economic and political crisis in its history. As described in the Decision on Liability (\u00b6\u00b6 41-57), the Argentine Government took a series of emergency measures to cope with the crisis, including the passage of an emergency law ending the fixed exchange rate of one US dollar (USD) to one Argentine peso (ARS), thereby devaluing the Argentine peso to one third of its previous value, refusing to revise upward the allowable tariffs and fees charged by AASA and other similar public service companies as provided by their prevailing legal frameworks, and seeking to force a renegotiation of concession contracts. These measures and Argentina\u2019s refusal to increase the tariffs for water and sewage treatment ultimately led to the failure of AASA since they deprived the Concession of the necessary revenue to meet its financial obligations to its lenders, particularly the multinational financial institutions, to make required investments in the water distribution and waste treatment systems for which it was responsible, and to allow its investors, the Claimants, to earn a reasonable return on their investments in AASA. Thus, in January 2003, July 2004, and March 2006, when AASA was unable to service its debts to the multilateral financial institutions, the Claimants, as guarantors of that debt, paid USD 5.56 million, USD 58.55 million, and USD 233.69 million respectively on those dates - a total of USD 297,793,000 - to the multilateral lenders in order to meet their obligations. As a result, the Claimants became the owners of AASA\u2019s debt obligations, originally held by the multilateral lenders.\n\n4.\n\nAlthough negotiations between AASA and the Argentine government continued over four years, no agreement was reached that would allow AASA an increase in tariffs. At the same time, the Argentine regulators insisted that AASA comply with its investment obligations under the Concession Contract and imposed heavy fines for failure to do so. In September 2005, the Claimants requested the government to terminate the Concession, but that request would be denied. Ultimately, on March 21, 2006, alleging various violations of water quality standards, the government terminated the Concession, while demanding payment of a performance bond that the Claimants had pledged when AASA assumed the Concession. The water and sewage systems were immediately transferred to a new entity, *Agua y Saneamientos Argentinos S.A,* an entity owned, financed, and managed by the Argentine State, thus ending Argentina\u2019s thirteen year experience with the privatization of the water and sewage systems of Buenos Aires. Shortly thereafter, an insolvency proceeding (*concurso preventivo)* was begun in the Argentine courts to determine the various rights and obligations arising out of the termination, and AASA also brought suit against Argentina pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions of the Concession Contract for unjustified termination of the Concession.\n\n**B. Brief Procedural History**\n-------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nIn 2003, the Claimants filed a request for arbitration under the applicable treaties with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\"). The procedural history of the resulting cases has been long and complex and is described in the Decision on Liability.5 Claiming a total loss of their investments in AASA, the Claimants alleged that the injury to their investments was caused by Argentina\u2019s failure to respect the applicable treaties in three respects: 1) that Argentina\u2019s actions amounted to an illegal expropriation of their investments; 2) that Argentina denied their investments full protection and security; and 3) that Argentina failed to afford those investments fair and equitable treatment. The four Claimants alleged that their total loss as of June 2008 was USD 1,019.2 million.6 The precise amount of the loss claimed by each Claimant varied, depending upon the amount of its equity in AASA, the amount of the debt holdings and debt guarantees which it had purchased from the multilateral lenders, and the amount of its liability under the performance bond. In addition, Suez, as the designated operator of the Concession claimed USD 255.5 million for the loss of management fees pursuant to its Management Contract with AASA.\n\nFor a summary of the various procedural steps taken during the several years that these cases have progressed, see the ICSID website at https://icsid.worldbank.org/apps/ICSIDWEB/Pages/default.aspx.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Post Hearing Brief, June 18, 2008, \u00b6511.\n\n6.\n\nAfter lengthy hearings and voluminous pleadings, the Tribunal determined in its Decision on Liability that Argentina did not expropriate the Claimants\u2019 investment and did not deny them full protection and security as required by the applicable investment treaties. It did, however, conclude that Argentina had denied the Claimants fair and equitable treatment7 in that its \"...actions in refusing to revise the tariff according to the legal framework of the Concession and in pursuing the forced renegotiation of the Concession Contract contrary to that legal framework violated its obligations under the applicable BITs...\"8 Although the Claimants had argued that Argentina\u2019s unilateral termination of the Concession also violated their rights under the investment treaties, the Tribunal rejected that claim, stating that it had no jurisdiction to judge whether Argentina\u2019s actions had breached the Concession Contract since \"... [w]hether Argentina breached the Concession Contract by termination it is a matter for the dispute resolution procedures provided in that contract.\"9\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6246.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6246.\n\n7.\n\nHaving determined the liability of Argentina in these cases, the Tribunal decided that, because of the complexity involved in ascertaining damages, a matter extensively argued with widely differing conclusions by each party with the assistance of financial specialists who prepared extensive reports and testified at the hearing on the merits, it was appropriate after issuing its Decision on Liability to create a separate procedural phase devoted to damages and to seek the services of an independent financial expert to assist the Tribunal in the task of valuing the loss, if any, sustained by the Claimants as a result of Argentina\u2019s actions. Before undertaking this phase, the Tribunal asked each party for its observations on the wisdom of the Tribunal appointing a financial expert, the process by which such person might be selected, and the procedure to be followed by that person to carry out the tasks assigned by the Tribunal. The Claimants and the Respondent provided their views on these issues in their post-hearing submissions.\n\n8.\n\nHaving decided in its Decision on Liability to seek the assistance of an independent financial expert, the Tribunal, by letter of September 10, 2010, asked counsel for the parties to confer in order to propose jointly to the Tribunal: 1) the name and qualifications of a person to serve as the Tribunal\u2019s independent expert; and 2) the terms of reference to guide such a person. In the event that the parties proved unable to make such a joint proposal by a specific date, the Tribunal further informed the parties that the Tribunal on its own initiative would proceed to propose such an individual and prepare proposed terms of reference, giving the parties thereafter an opportunity to present their observations on the Tribunal\u2019s proposals. Counsel for the parties did in fact hold such consultations and requested an extension of time to arrive at a joint proposal. By the beginning of 2011, however, the parties were not able to agree on a joint proposal of an individual to serve as the Tribunal\u2019s independent financial expert or on the terms of reference that would guide such person.\n\n9.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore asked the parties for their individual observations on the terms of reference and in a letter of February 12, 2011, requested each party to submit only to the Secretary of the Tribunal a list of not more than five names of persons to serve as the Tribunal\u2019s independent financial expert. Thereafter, the following procedures would be followed: if only one of the names on both lists coincided, the Secretary was to communicate that name and related *curriculum vitae* to the Tribunal, which would then proceed to appoint that individual unless there were compelling reasons not to do so. If two or more names on the lists coincided, the Secretary was to communicate both names to the Tribunal, which would appoint one of those persons, unless compelling reasons required otherwise. If none of the names on the parties\u2019 lists coincided, the Secretary was to communicate all names to the Tribunal with an indication of the party that proposed each one. The Tribunal would not appoint any of these candidates and would instead proceed to designate a financial expert from persons not appearing on either list. None of the names proposed by the parties did coincide, so the Tribunal conducted its own search for an independent financial expert and proceeded to draft terms of reference, taking into account the observations of the parties.\n\n10.\n\nAfter further consultations with the parties, the Tribunal, on June 15, 2011, issued a Procedural Order Concerning the Terms of Reference of the Tribunal-Appointed Financial Expert. The basic direction of the Terms of Reference was as follows:\n\n\"The Expert shall examine, analyze, and provide the Tribunal with a written report (the Report) with respect to the financial injury sustained by the Claimants as a result of the breach of the relevant bilateral investment treaties by the Respondent, as determined by the Tribunal in its Decision on Liability of 30 July 2010.\"\n\n11.\n\nIn furtherance of this basic mission, the Procedural Order specified the various documents that the Financial Expert was to examine, the specific issues to be addressed in the Financial Expert\u2019s Report to the Tribunal, and the powers of the Expert to consult with the parties and party-appointed experts and to seek clarifications from the Tribunal. Within one hundred and twenty (120) days of receiving all the specified documents, the Expert was to prepare a Preliminary Report, which after review by the Tribunal was to be sent to the parties who were to submit their written comments within sixty (60) days of receipt. After considering the parties\u2019 comments, the Expert was to prepare a Final Report. Within forty-five (45) days of receiving the Final Report, the parties were to submit their comments. Thereafter, a hearing of not more than three (3) days would be held at which the parties would have an opportunity to examine the Expert.\n\n12.\n\nIn the meanwhile, the Tribunal conducted an international search for an individual expert who possessed the competence and the independence to serve as the Tribunal\u2019s Financial Expert in these cases. The required expertise necessitated a person who was not only deeply knowledgeable in the theory and practice of finance but was also learned in the economics and financial dimensions of infrastructure projects. For that person to be independent, in the opinion of the Tribunal, he or she should not have financial relationships with any of the parties and should not have been engaged in any litigation on behalf of or against any of the parties or for any law firm that had represented any of the parties in these cases or any law firm that had engaged in litigation against any of the parties. Ultimately, without objection from any of the parties, the Tribunal by a Procedural Order of August 3, 2011, appointed as its independent Financial Expert, Dr. Akash Deep, Senior Lecturer in Public Policy at the John F. Kennedy School of Government of Harvard University, a former Senior Economist of the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, and an expert on infrastructure finance, valuation, regulation, and privatization.\n\n13.\n\nWithin a few days of appointment of the Financial Expert, the Tribunal Secretary, at the direction of the Tribunal, sent Dr. Deep numerous documents relating to these cases, including the parties\u2019 several memorials and submissions, with the accompanying reports of their financial experts, and the transcripts of the hearing on the merits. After examining this voluminous material, Dr. Deep determined that he needed extensive additional information in order to carry out his assigned tasks as the Tribunal\u2019s Independent Financial Expert, and he therefore communicated to the Tribunal the precise documents that would be required. By Procedural Order of December 28, 2011, requesting additional pleadings and documentation from the parties with respect to damages, the Tribunal asked the parties to provide the various valuation model spread sheets and other documents requested by Dr. Deep. Moreover, since the original pleadings of the parties with respect to damages were based on the Claimants\u2019 allegations that Argentina had violated the applicable investment treaties in three respects, illegal expropriation, failure to provide full protection and security, and the denial of fair and equitable treatment, and since the Tribunal, in its Decision of Liability found only the last mentioned violation, the Procedural Order of December 28, 2011, also asked the parties \"...to submit simultaneous memorials to the Secretary of the Tribunal in which they may make any adjustments they deem necessary to their prior pleadings in these cases with respect to damages so as to take account of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability... \" By letter of February 8, 2012 to the parties, the Tribunal provided certain clarifications with respect to its Procedural Order of December 28, 2011.\n\n14.\n\nIn response to that Procedural Order and the clarifying letter, the Claimants and the Respondent each filed Memorials on Damages, accompanied by supporting reports from their respective financial experts, on March 15, 2012. On May 18, 2012, each party submitted comments on the Memorial on Damages previously submitted by the other party. In essence, the Claimants asserted that as of March 2007 they had sustained a loss as a result of Argentina\u2019s failure to provide their investments with fair and equitable treatment of USD 889.1 million, which when actualized to February 2012 amounted to total loss of USD 1,060.9 million. Argentina, on the other hand, asserted for various reasons that the amount of the loss sustained by the Claimants as a result of Argentina\u2019s measures was \"zero.\"\n\n15.\n\nIn the following months, Dr. Deep requested various additional documents from the parties, and Argentina submitted various additional documents and submissions which the Claimants challenged, requiring the Tribunal to issue Procedural Orders on the admissibility of documents.\n\n16.\n\nOn December 24, 2012, pursuant to his Terms of Reference, Dr. Deep submitted a *Preliminary Report of the Financial Expert to the Tribunal.* Based on comments from the Tribunal, Dr. Deep prepared a revised version of the *Preliminary Report* on January 31, 2013, which after further examination by the Tribunal, was forwarded to the parties for their comments and observations. On April 8, 2013, the parties submitted their comments to Dr. Deep\u2019s *Preliminary Report.* After reviewing these comments, Dr. Deep prepared and submitted to the Tribunal on July 22, 2013 his *Final Report of the Financial Expert to the Tribunal,* a 171-page document, plus detailed supporting annexes, which was then forwarded to the parties. On August 27 and 28, 2013, the parties submitted to the Tribunal their comments on Dr. Deep\u2019s *Final Report,* along with supporting reports from their individual financial experts.\n\n17.\n\nAs agreed by the parties, the Tribunal held a hearing on damages *{quantum),* from September 19 through 21, 2013, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. At the hearing, Dr. Deep presented his findings with respect to the amount of compensation that the individual Claimants should receive as a result of the injury caused by Argentina\u2019s actions, and was examined by counsel of each of the parties. Thereafter, the parties\u2019 financial experts testified as to their views on the amount of the losses sustained by the Claimants, and they were in turn examined by opposing counsel. At the conclusion of the hearing, the parties agreed that the submission of posthearing pleadings would not be necessary.10 The Tribunal agreed but asked that each party submit a statement of the costs incurred in the arbitration. The parties made their submissions on costs on October 21, and 22, 2013, respectively. Those submissions would also be the subject of challenges by the parties.\n\nThe parties also agreed on Dr. Deep\u2019s continued assistance to the Tribunal through the conclusion of the cases. Transcript of the Hearing on Damages, Saturday, September 21, 2013, p. 625, lines 13-20.\n\n18.\n\nIn the process of its deliberations following the hearing, the Tribunal addressed the following question to Dr. Deep: \"Was AASA going to fail anyway because of its high leverage or for other reasons not connected to the Argentine Government\u2019s actions during the crisis?\" By memorandum of September 21, 2014, Dr. Deep responded to this question. The Tribunal submitted this memorandum to the parties for their observations and they responded in due course.\n\n19.\n\nOn February 20, 2015, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed.\n\n20.\n\nOn the basis of the voluminous submissions in this case, the *Final Report* of the Tribunal\u2019s Financial Expert, and the testimony and exhibits presented at three days of hearings, September 19-21, 2013, it is now the task of the Tribunal to determine the amount of compensation, if any, that the Respondent owes to the Claimants as a result of its actions which this Tribunal determined in its Decision on Liability of July 30, 2010 violated Argentina\u2019s treaty obligations to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment.\n\n21.\n\nThe four Claimants in these two cases, Suez, Vivendi, AGBAR, and AWG, allege that the total amount of their injury resulting from Argentina\u2019s treaty breaches is USD 868 million, actualized to December 31, 2012. This total amount of the loss, which is some 20% less than what the Claimants previously sought, is due to the fact that the Claimants, while contesting certain elements of Dr. Deep\u2019s methodology, decided not to propose changes to that methodology but instead accepted it, while amending it to conform to their view of its proper application to their situations. They assert that their losses consist of five elements, the first three being the most significant: 1) losses incurred as a result of their payments to the multilateral financial institutions as guarantors of AASA\u2019s loan obligations; 2) their financial injury sustained as a result of the loss of their equity interests in AASA; and 3) in the case of Suez, the financial injury incurred due to lost management fees as the designated Concession operator under the Management Contract; 4) earned but unpaid management fees owing to Suez as of the beginning of 2002; and 5) unpaid past due dividends. The amounts claimed by each of the four Claimants for each type of injury, actualized to December 31, 2012, were as follows:\n\n**Suez:** a) loss on guaranteed debt, USD 186 million; b) loss on equity, USD132.6 million; c) loss on management fees, USD 243.7 million; d) loss on earned but unpaid management fees as of 2002, USD 9 million; and e) losses on unpaid dividends, USD 1.6 million.\n\n**Vivendi:** a) loss on guaranteed debt, USD 35.2 million; b) loss on equity, USD 25.1 million; and c) loss on past due dividends, USD 0.3 million.\n\n**AGBAR:** a) loss on guaranteed debt, USD 116.5; b) loss on equity USD 83.1 million; and loss on past due dividends, USD 1 million.\n\n**AWG:** a) loss on guaranteed debts, USD 19.8 million; b) loss on equity, USD 14.1 million; and c) loss on past due dividends of USD 0.2 million.11\n\nIn addition, the Claimants seek reimbursement of all costs they have incurred in this arbitration, an amount alleged to be USD 21,948,516.56. Argentina totally rejects all of the Claimants\u2019 demands and asks the Tribunal to direct the Claimants to reimburse it for all costs which it incurred in these proceedings, an amount claimed to be USD 2,651,444.90.\n\n\"Valuation of Losses to Shareholder Investors of Aguas Argentinas S.A.: Comments on Dr. Akash Deep\u2019s Final Report,\" by Manuel A. Abdala and Pablo T. Spiller, Compass Lexecon, August 28, 2013, Appendix B, p. 46.\n\n**II. The Legal Standard of Compensation**\n------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nIn determining compensation for breach of a treaty obligation, it is first necessary for the Tribunal to decide on the correct legal standard to apply in calculating the resulting loss to the Claimants. None of the three BITs governing these cases specifies that standard or, indeed, mentions the consequences of a treaty breach, refers to the issues of compensation or damages, or even makes a specific grant of authority to tribunals to award damages in investor-state arbitrations. On the other hand, the ICSID Convention, which by virtue of the France-Argentina BIT, Article 8, and the Argentina-Spain BIT, Article X.4, applies to the proceedings of this Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, provides in Article 48(3) that \"... [t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal...\" Furthermore, Article 54 of the ICSID Convention imposes on Contracting States the obligation \"... to recognize and enforce an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and to enforce the *pecuniary obligations* imposed by that award...\" (emphasis supplied), thus recognizing implicitly the power of an ICSID Tribunal to award compensation in appropriate cases. However, the 1976 Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL), which, by virtue of Article 8 of the Argentina-U.K BIT, are applicable to the claims of AWG against Argentina, a case also within the competence of this Tribunal, contains no similar specific reference to the award of damages or the imposition of pecuniary obligations on a respondent.\n\n23.\n\nAll three BITs, however, direct the Tribunal to decide disputes not only in accordance with the applicable treaty provisions but also in accordance with \"...the relevant principles of international law...\" (Article 8(4), France-Argentina BIT), \"... the general principles of international law (Article X.5, Argentina-Spain BIT), or \"...the applicable principles of international law... \" (Article 8(4), Argentina-UK BIT). As both the Claimants and the Respondent in this case have agreed in their pleadings, the legal basis for awarding compensation in this case and the standard to be applied in determining the amount of that compensation is therefore to be found in international law; however, they do not agree on the specific content of the applicable international law principles and the way in which they should be applied to the precise facts of these cases. This Tribunal, like others,12 must therefore look to customary international law for the legal principles that govern the determination of damages in these cases.\n\nE.g., *National Grid pic* v. *Argentine Republic,* UNCITRAL, Award, November 3, 2008, (\u00b6 269: *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp, and LG&E International Inc.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1), Award, July 25, 2008, \u00b6\u00b629-32: *SD Myers* v. *Government of Canada,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award, November 13, 2000, \u00b6\u00b6310 and 315.\n\n24.\n\nIn its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal determined that the Respondent failed to comply with its treaty obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the investments of the Claimants. Pursuant to Article 26 *{Pacta Sunt Servanda)* of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, a provision that embodies a fundamental principle of customary international law, \"[e]very treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must be performed by them in good faith.\" The three BITs to which Argentina was and is a party create obligations under international law. Article 2 of the *Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts,*13 which is generally considered as a statement of customary international law and on which both parties in this case have relied at various times, states:\n\n\"There is an international wrongful act of a State when conduct consisting of an act or omission:\n\n(a) is attributable to the State under international law; and\n\n(b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.\"\n\nUnited Nations *Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries,* 2001 (hereinafter *Articles)* (2001), adopted by the International Law Commission at its fifty-third session in 2001 and submitted to the General Assembly as part of the Commission\u2019s Report covering that session. Available at http://legal.un.Org/ilc/texts/instrunients/enghsh/comnientaries/9 6 2001.pdf.\n\n25.\n\nThe acts and omissions of Argentina in denying the Claimants fair and equitable treatment as required by the three BITs were therefore international wrongful acts since the acts and omissions in question, as actions done by state organs, were clearly attributable to the Argentine State14 and since, as the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability found, they constituted a breach of Argentina\u2019s international obligations. As Article 1 of the *Articles* provides: \"Every wrongful act of a State entails the international responsibility of that state.\" The comment to Article 1 makes clear that the term \"international responsibility\" \"...covers the new legal relations which arise under international law by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\" Argentina, by reason of its international wrong in not respecting its obligations under the three BITs, is therefore subject to a new relationship toward the Claimants. Inherent in that relationship is the obligation to compensate the parties injured as a result of its failure to fulfill its international obligations.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the *Articles* provides: \"The conduct of any state organ shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial, or any other functions, whatever position it holds in the organization of the state, and whatever its character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.\"\n\n26.\n\nAs the responsible State, Argentina is, according to the *Articles,* Art. 31(1), \"...under an obligation to make full reparation for the injury caused by [its] internationally wrongful act.\" \"Injury,\" in this sense, \"...includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.\"15 Thus, there must be a causal link between the internationally wrongful act and the injury for which reparation is claimed. If such a link exists, then Argentina is required to make \"full reparation\" for the injury it has caused.\n\nArticle 31(2), *Articles.*\n\n27.\n\nAs the **Articles** state, reparation for an injury caused by an internationally wrongful act \"... shall take the form of restitution, compensation, and satisfaction, either singly or in combination...\"16 In the cases before this Tribunal, the Claimants are seeking compensation for the injuries they claim to have sustained as a result of Argentina\u2019s breach of the three applicable BITs. With respect to the meaning of \"full reparation\" required by Article 31 quoted above, Article 36 of the **Articles** makes clear that \"...the State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, in so far as such damage is not made good by restitution...\" and that \"... [t]he compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage including lost profits insofar as it is established.\" Thus the basic standard to be applied is that of full compensation *{restitutio in integrum)* for the loss incurred as a result of the internationally wrongful act. This statement represents the accepted standard in customary international law and is often supported by reference to the *Chorzow Factory Case* in which the Permanent Court of International Justice stated, \"[I]t is a principle of international law, and even a general conception of law, that any breach of an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation.\"17 And also: \"[t]he essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act -a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals - is that reparation must, so far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"18 Customary international law therefore requires this Tribunal to award \"full compensation\" to the Claimants for the injuries caused by Argentina\u2019s treaty violations, to seek \"to wipe out all the consequences\" of Argentina\u2019s illegal acts, and to place the Claimants \"in the situation which would, in all probability, have existed\" if Argentina had not committed its illegal acts. Moreover, it should be noted that in order to ensure full compensation to injured parties, customary international law authorizes the payment of interest on the principal sum due from the time the amount should have been paid until the date when the payment obligation is actually fulfilled.19\n\nArticle 34, *Articles.*\n\n*The Factory at Chorzow* (Germany v. Poland), Judgment, 1928 P.C.I.J. (ser. A) No. 17, \u00b6 29 (September 13).\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b647.\n\nArticle 38, *Articles,* provides:  \n*1. Interest on any principal sum due under this chapter shall be payable when necessary in order to ensure full reparation. The interest rate and mode of calculation shall be set so as to achieve that result.*  \n*2. Interest runs from the date when the principal sum should have been paid until the date the obligation to pay is fulfilled.*\n\n**III. The Application of the Principle of Full Compensation to These Cases**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. In General**\n-----------------\n\n28.\n\nThe application of the aforementioned customary international law principles on damages is in theory rather simple. It requires the Tribunal to engage in a three-step process. First, it must determine the value of the investment in the hypothetical situation where Argentina did not take measures that violated its treaty obligations, a situation referred to by Dr. Deep in his *Final Report* as \"without measures.\" Second, it must then determine the value of the investment as a result of the offending measures that Argentina did take, a situation which Dr. Deep calls \"with measures.\" Third, the Tribunal must subtract the second value from the first and then actualize that amount by means of an appropriate interest rate to arrive at the damages owing to the Claimants so as to put them in the financial position they would have been had Argentina not breached the applicable BITs. Dr. Deep embodies this simple idea in the following equally simple formula, in which V is equal to the market value of the investment in the two situations:\n\n**Damages = [V without measures] - [V with measures].20**\n\nThe parties\u2019 experts also used this general methodology but employed different terminology to identify the two situations in the formula.\n\n*Final Report,* \u00b662.\n\n29.\n\nIn practice, however, the application of this approach and the customary international law that underlies it is far more complicated, particularly in the facts and circumstances of these cases. In particular, it is complicated by the nature of the investments that the Claimants lost as a result of Argentina\u2019s actions. Their investments were not fixed, physical assets, such as a factory or a pipeline, whose valuation usually may be made relatively easily. Instead, what the Claimants lost in these cases at the time of the measures taken in violation of the applicable treaties was the stream of revenue, often referred to as a \"cash flow,\" expected to be received over the remaining term of the Concession Contract. That stream of revenue was intended by the parties to the Concession to compensate the Claimants for the substantial investments that they had made in the Buenos Aires\u2019 water and sewage systems, particularly in the early years of the Concession, and to give them a reasonable profit for developing and operating those systems over a thirty-year period. Since the source of that revenue stream was the fees paid by consumers, its precise volume and value depended on many variables, both foreseen and unforeseen, over the next three decades, including population growth in the area, general economic conditions, technological changes, labor conditions, management efficiency, inflation, operating costs, and many others. In addition, in view of the fact that AASA was providing a public service and was therefore subject to governmental regulation, the actions and decisions of governmental regulators were further crucial factors influencing the value of the Claimants\u2019 investments.\n\n30.\n\nAll of these variables certainly render difficult a precise answer to the question of what would the Claimants\u2019 investments be worth by the year 2023 if Argentina had not violated the BITs. It is however precisely that question that this Tribunal must answer if it is to correctly apply the international law on damages to these cases. In order to arrive at the values of the investments in the *with* and *without* measures scenarios, it would be necessary to calculate the cash flows for each and then discount those totals to present value using an appropriate discount rate which takes account of the weighted costs of capital and other factors applicable to the two situations. To assist the Tribunal in this process, Dr. Deep constructed an economic model of AASA\u2019s operations which sought to capture numerous relevant economic variables and to determine with a certain degree of mathematical precision their impact on each other and on the costs, revenues, and profitability of the Concession. The model not only required the input of numerous data sources but it also necessitated that Dr. Deep make certain macroeconomic assumptions about such matters as prevailing interest, exchange, and inflation rates, which he describes in the appendices to his *Final Report,* that would have an important impact on AASA\u2019s operations. Nonetheless, in this regard, it is worth remembering that international law does not demand absolute certainty in valuing the damages sustained by the Claimants but only, in the words of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory Case,* to place the Claimants \"in the situation which would, *in all probability,* have existed\" if Argentina had not committed its illegal acts (emphasis supplied). In order to accomplish that, the Tribunal and its Independent Financial Expert had necessarily to engage in the hypothetical exercise of building a scenario to determine the financial fate of the Claimants in the situation where Argentina had accorded the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment.\n\n31.\n\nThis probable scenario is necessarily hypothetical in nature because it reflects events that did not occur, but that in all probability would have been the reasonable outcome of the fulfillment by Argentina of its international obligations under the three BITs protecting the Claimants\u2019 investments. In the circumstances of the case, the hypothetical situation developed by the Tribunal would imply progressive, coordinated action by Argentina, AASA, and the Claimants as they sought to cope with the effects of the financial crisis on the Concession. Fair and equitable treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investment by Argentina would have fostered, in a first stage, cooperation between the parties, in accordance with the Concession Contract and the general principle of good faith, thereby creating a new situation that would ensure the continuation of the service, in line with the general spirit and intent of the Concession. Such cooperation would in turn have set in motion a dynamic that would have led to a set of agreements between the parties, the individual components and details of which they could have defined in various ways. However, what is essential is that, if Argentina had fulfilled its obligations and would have provided an immediate relief to AASA through instruments provided by the regulatory framework, in *\"all probability\"* the reasonable outcome of such cooperation between the parties, adapting the Concession to the new economic and legal situation of early 2002, would have been a set of agreements ensuring the viability of the Concession.\n\n32.\n\nSuch agreements between the parties could have embodied various individual formulations of the model for the continuation of the service. However, for the purpose of determining the *but-for* scenario required to calculate the compensation to which Claimants are entitled, it is not necessary to specify the details of various models or formulas or to speculate on which of them the parties would most likely have accepted. It is enough to determine a model that meets the following requirements: 1) it ensures the viability of the service and of the Concession; (2) it accords with the original equation of the Concession and with the agreements and practices of the parties until December 2001; (3) it embodies the concept of shared sacrifices to ensure the viability of the service and of the Concession; and (4) it is deemed reasonably acceptable to both parties in a scenario of cooperation and not of confrontation between them.\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that if Argentina had fulfilled its obligations according to the standard of fair and equitable treatment of the Claimants\u2019 investments, in all probability both parties would have succeeded in developing and agreeing to such model. Since this process of definition and development became impossible because of Argentina\u2019s breach of its international obligations, this task falls on the Tribunal which, in the exercise of prudent judicial discretion, must carry it out by applying standards of reasonableness. In consequence thereof, the Tribunal, with the support of its Expert, decided that it was appropriate to adopt the previously described model of the *but-for* scenario.\n\n34.\n\nThe Claimants and Dr. Deep have given that scenario various labels, including \"without measures,\" \"but-for,\" and \"counterfactual\" scenario. Before undertaking the exercise of scenario building, the Tribunal must consider two preliminary issues raised by the Respondent during this proceeding: 1) the valuation period to be applied in calculating the value of Claimants\u2019 investments in AASA; and 2) the issue of double recovery posed by AASA\u2019s litigation in Argentine courts for unjustified termination of the Concession Contract.\n\n**B. Preliminary Issues**\n-------------------------\n\n**1. The Valuation Period**\n---------------------------\n\n35.\n\nAn initial issue of contention raised by Argentina with respect to the application of the above-described methodology to these cases concerns the appropriate length of the period for measuring the projected cash flows to AASA during the Concession. Argentina argues that the period for measuring the cash flows should run from the date of actions violating the BITs in 2002 until the termination of the Concession in 2006, not until 2023, the date of the Concession\u2019s expiration according to the Concession Contract. While the Respondent used the former, shorter period in its damage calculations, both Dr. Deep and the Claimants used the longer, latter period. Such a reduction in the valuation period would of course substantially reduce the value of the Claimants\u2019 holdings in AASA. Relying on the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability, which held that Argentina\u2019s action in terminating the Contract did not violate any of the applicable BITs, Argentina argues that any injury incurred by the Claimants after the termination in 2006 was a matter to be resolved in Argentine courts according to the dispute resolution provisions of the Concession Contract.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with Argentina on this point. Under international law, as noted above, the Claimants\u2019 are entitled to full compensation for what they have lost as a consequence of Argentina\u2019s treaty violations. Just as one would not value the loss of a house in a fire based on the market value of the burned structure after the fire, but rather would value the house just before the fire\u2019s occurrence, this Tribunal must begin its valuation of what the Claimants have lost as a result of Argentina\u2019s illegal actions at a point in time just before those actions took place. In its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal determined that the first breach of the treaties took place on January 6, 2002.21 Just before that point in time, AASA, and therefore the Claimants, had the right to a revenue stream which would continue for another 21 years until the year 2023, not just for another five years until the year 2006 when, unknown to them in 2002, Argentina would terminate the Concession. To limit the valuation period to five instead of twenty-one years would, of course, seriously undervalue the investments lost as a consequence of Argentina\u2019s treaty violations. It is true that the risk of termination was always present in the Concession; however, that risk, along with other risks, would be accounted for in the rate applied to discount to present value the remaining twenty-one years of projected cash flows. The termination of the Concession Contract by Argentina, even if not illegal under the BITs, cannot exonerate it from its obligation to repair the consequences of its wrongful act in denying fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants\u2019 investments.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 247: \"For purposes of the forthcoming determination of the legal consequences of such breaches, the Tribunal further concludes that the first abovementioned breach took place on 6 January 2002, date of the enactment of the Emergency Law, which was the first of a series of measures frustrating the investors\u2019 legitimately protected expectations, whereas the second abovementioned breach took place on 10 April 2002, date of the adoption of MoE Resolution No. 38/02, which was the first of a series of measures making the renegotiation process an unfair and inequitable one.\"\n\n37.\n\nThe starting point of the Valuation Period is connected with the date of first breach of fair and equitable treatment by Argentina, in January 2002, according to the Decision on Liability (\u00b6\u00b6247). Arbitrator Pedro Nikken disagreed on this point in his Separate Opinion (\u00b6\u00b644); however, he accepts that such starting point is consistent with the Decision on Liability and, to such extent, he concurs to this Award.\n\n**2. The Problem of Double Recovery**\n-------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nWhile international law requires full compensation for injury, it does not allow for *more* than full compensation. In addition to the present cases, which were begun in 2003, the Claimants brought an action in 2006 in the Argentine courts against the Argentine State for breach of the Concession Contract by virtue of \"termination through the fault of the Conceding Authority.\" Under Article 14.8.3 of the Concession Contract, in the event of termination of the Contract through the fault of the Conceding Authority, AASA was to receive its performance guarantee and the value of the unamortized assets acquired or constructed by AASA, as well as any damages caused by the termination. This judicial claim is apparently the only asset now owned by AASA, and it is reflected in its Financial Statement of December 31, 2011, as valued at ARS 2,487,600.000. Argentina argues that this claim in the Argentine courts presents the risk of double recovery should the Tribunal award compensation to the Claimants for treaty violations. However, neither Argentina nor the Claimants have offered any evidence that the Argentine courts have either awarded or are about to award compensation to AASA for the termination of the Concession. Consequently, no actual double recovery has been established so far. In the present situation, if this Tribunal should award damages to the Claimant, that fact alone would not result in a double recovery for the Claimants.\n\n39.\n\nThe parties and the Tribunal also addressed the issue of the possibility of double recovery during both the merits and damages phases of these cases. During the merits phase, the Claimants in their Reply Memorial stated: \"The Claimants agree to waive all rights over any receivables obtained in liquidation or local court proceedings should this Tribunal determine that full compensation is payable to the Claimants, such waiver to become effective upon receipt of such payment.\"22 At that time, the Tribunal saw no reason to delay its Decision on Liability because of the possibility that the Argentine courts might award damages to AASA for the alleged unjustified termination of the Concession Contract. During the hearing on damages, the Claimants again affirmed that they did not intend to seek compensation in local court proceedings for any loss already awarded and paid to them in this arbitration.23\n\nClaimants\u2019 Reply Memorial, \u00b6658.\n\nDuring the hearing on damages, counsel for the Claimants, in response to Argentina\u2019s expressed concerns about the risk of double recovery, quoted the above-referenced statement in its Reply Memorial and then stated: \"It\u2019s a commitment. We reiterate that commitment.\" Transcript of the Hearing on Damages, Saturday, September 21.2013, p. 550, lines 2-14.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware of no facts or circumstances that have transpired since that time that justify delaying an award of damages in these cases. The Tribunal believes that to award damages in the present circumstances of these cases presents no double recovery problem. The Argentine courts have not yet granted any recovery to AASA. If this Tribunal should award damages in these cases, it is certain that the Argentine government would make the relevant court aware of that fact. The problem of avoiding double recovery would then be a matter for the Argentine courts to consider under Argentine law if and when they are contemplating awarding damages to AASA in the cases currently subject to their jurisdiction.\n\n**C. Constructing the \"But-for\" (\"Without Measures\") Scenario**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nIn order to value the Claimants\u2019 investments without Argentina\u2019s offending measures, it is necessary to construct a hypothetical, counterfactual scenario as to the situation of the Claimants\u2019 investments had Argentina not treated those investments unfairly and inequitably. At its heart, that scenario must answer the following question: what specific actions should the Argentine government and its regulators have taken in respect of tariff revisions in 2001-2002 for its conduct to have resulted in fair and equitable treatment of AASA and therefore of the Claimants\u2019 investments? To answer that question, the Tribunal first examines the nature of the Concession transactions and how a reasonable regulator would have conceived of and dealt with the Concession Company, the investors, and the thirty-year relationship among AASA, its investors, and the Argentine state.\n\n42.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that a reasonable regulator intent on according the investors fair and equitable treatment would be guided by three basic principles in its relations with a regulated entity like AASA. First, such a regulator would seek to assure the continued provision both short-term and long-term of the vital public service being provided by AASA. Second, it would seek to assure the continued existence, by all reasonable means, of the regulated entity that is providing that service. Third, even though circumstances may prevent the strict application for the time being of all the provisions of the Concession\u2019s regulatory framework, a fair and equitable regulator would seek to follow the basic spirit and intent of the agreements that existed between the government and the regulated entity. That basic spirit and intent were ones of cooperation between participants in a long-term joint venture. Indeed, AASA was an early example of a public-private partnership (PPP), a concept that has now gained much currency in international infrastructure development. One would expect that the partners would work together cooperatively to solve their problems when unexpected adverse circumstances strike. Thus for example, one partner would not take advantage of those circumstances to drive the other out of business. In its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal stressed the importance of the need for AASA and the Argentine government to work together:\n\n\"Beyond the specific words and commitments of the regulatory framework and the Concession Contract, the Claimants, having entered into a thirty-year relationship with Argentina, were entitled to expect that Argentina would manage that relationship in a cooperative manner, that is to say, that they would \u2018work together\u2019 so that the relationship was mutually advantageous. Indeed, Article 5.1 of the Concession Contract required the Concessionaire and ETOSS \u2018...to use all means at their disposal to establish and maintain a fluid relationship that facilitates the performance of this Concession Contract.\u2019 In effect, the legal framework seemed to envision a relationship between the Concessionaire and the Argentine authorities that would be a concrete example of the economic cooperation that the BITs sought to promote. During the first eight years, such a cooperative relationship seemed to prevail.\"24\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b61233\n\n43.\n\nThe Concession Contract does not define \"fluid relationship.\" The Tribunal considers that it means, at the very least, a relationship of give-and-take between AASA and the Argentine state, a relationship characterized by open communication and a spirit of collaboration in jointly solving problems that might beset the Concession over the years. The Tribunal does not consider the provisions of Article 5.1 of the Concession Contract requiring the Concessionaire and the regulator \"...to establish and maintain a fluid relationship that facilitates the performance of this Concession Contract... \" to be mere rhetoric. On the contrary, they express a fundamental recognition of the important principle that no thirty-year Concession Contract can survive on its specific legal provisions alone and that such survival is vitally dependent on a productive and cooperative working relationship between the parties.\n\n44.\n\nIn the opinion of the Tribunal, these three principles undergirded the work of Dr. Deep, its Independent Financial Expert, in constructing a \"without measures\" (\"but-for\") scenario.\n\n45.\n\nIn his *Final Report,* Dr. Deep postulates that the \"but-for\" scenario would involve the following four steps : 1) tariffs would have been raised at the rate of inflation in 2002 and subsequent years; 2) *immediate liquidity relief* would be provided by the Argentine government in the form of an interest free loan or its equivalent, estimated at ARS 132.6 million, to AASA for a period of twelve months after the enactment of the Emergency Law to the extent that the additional revenue earned by AASA in 2002 from the increase in tariffs failed to cover the increase in Argentine peso payments on AASA\u2019s dollar-denominated debt obligations; 3) AASA\u2019s Capital Expenditure Plan would be adjusted for the remainder of the Concession period to the level actually implemented or proposed by AASA; and 4) a full review of the economics of the Concession Contract would be conducted in 2003 whereby the tariff would be adjusted to ensure that the Concession Contract was in financial equilibrium of revenues and expenditures.25\n\n*Final Report,* \u00b6\u00b6 69 *et seq.*\n\n46.\n\nThe aim of such a review was to ensure that the Concession achieved financial equilibrium as prescribed by the Water Decree and would take account of the new market parameters that came into existence after the abandonment of the currency peg and after the attainment by Argentina of relatively stable macroeconomic and financial market parameters. On the basis of such a simulation, Dr. Deep determined that a nominal tariff adjustment of 18.2% (13.2% in real terms) would be applied as of January 1, 2004.26\n\n*Final Report,* \u00b693.\n\n47.\n\nFor its part, the Claimants, under the Deep scenario, would also have had to cover any resulting shortfall in cash flow with capital infusions and would have had to waive payment of management fees under the management contract until all debt had been paid. In developing this scenario, Dr. Deep relied upon the legal framework, the Decision on Liability, and Resolution 602/9927 issued by the Argentine Secretary of Natural Resources and Sustainable Development and applied by the *Ente Tripartito de Obras y Servicios Sanitarios* (ETOSS), the relevant government regulatory agency. The purpose of Resolution 602/99 was to enunciate a set of principles that would strike a balance between the revenues that the Concession would be allowed to earn over its life and the costs of providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on the capital invested. Although Resolution 602/99 was submitted to the Argentine government for approval, such approval was never formally granted or specifically refused. Nonetheless, whatever the formal authority of Resolution 602/99, ETOSS did apply it in dealing with AASA. It is true that section 3.3 of the Addendum to Resolution 602/99 does not provide for liquidity relief as such; however, it does provide that Argentina has an obligation to increase tariffs in case of a change in currency parity at least to the level of the increase of debt service due to the parity change. Thus, its purpose was to enable AASA to have sufficient liquidity to meet its debt obligations. At the same time, Dr. Deep considered that increasing tariffs by more than the rate of inflation would not be realistic under the circumstances that Argentina faced at the time. Thus, his proposal of a one-year interest free loan appears to be a reasonable and constructive device within the spirit and intent to the Resolution 602/99 to enable AASA to avoid defaulting on its debt obligations at least cost to Argentina.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Exhibit C-62.\n\n48.\n\nIn evaluating the scenario proposed by Dr. Deep, one may well ask: even if the parties had acted as suggested by Dr. Deep, was AASA going to fail anyway because of its high leverage or for other reasons not connected to the Argentine Government\u2019s actions during the crisis? The Tribunal specifically posed that very question to Dr. Deep during its deliberations, and he answered it in his memorandum of 21 September 2014 by stating that AASA would not have failed in that situation. Had Argentina fulfilled its treaty obligations by actually acting fairly and reasonably as a regulator by following a course of action similar to the one outlined in Dr. Deep\u2019s scenario, AASA, according to Dr. Deep, would have remained viable in the sense that its equity would have had a positive value. It is true that as a result of the steep devaluation of the Argentine peso, AASA\u2019s debt in Argentine pesos ballooned and its equity shrunk considerably to ARS 13.5 million in 2001.28 The result was a highly leveraged firm in which its total debt amounted to almost 98.7 % of its total value,29 but not a bankrupt one. It is also important to remember that the fact that the Claimants had guaranteed AASA\u2019s debt to the multilaterals would have given them a powerful incentive not to abandon the Concession, an action that would have cost the Claimants hundreds of millions of dollars, provided that they had some realistic hope of returning the Concession to a state of profitability. Such a hope depended crucially on the Claimants\u2019 evaluation of the Argentine regulator\u2019s future treatment of AASA. Appropriate actions by the Argentine government towards revising tariffs, as suggested by Dr. Deep, would not only have had the effect of improving AASA\u2019s cash flow situation and easing the burden of servicing its debt but it would also have been a powerful signal to the Claimants and to AASA of the Argentine government\u2019s cooperative attitude toward the Concession, encouraging the Claimants to take the necessary steps to support the Company in a time of great adversity. On the other hand, as Dr. Deep concluded, Argentina\u2019s persistent refusal to revise tariffs of the Concession, which after all was providing a vital public service to millions of its citizens, virtually assured its demise, a result that eventually took place. Thus, according to Dr. Deep, the failure of Argentina to revise tariffs caused the financial failure of AASA while his proposed or a similar program of adjustments that Argentina might have taken would have allowed it to survive as a financially viable operation.\n\n*Final Report,* \u00b6252.\n\n*Final Report,* (\u00b6 389.\n\n49.\n\nThe parties have raised various objections to the scenario advanced by Dr. Deep. On the one hand, the Claimants argue that the liquidity relief proposed should not be a one-year interest-free loan repayable by AASA, but rather an outright subsidy or other type of permanent capital infusion by Argentina in order to compensate AASA for the loss sustained when Argentina abruptly devalued its currency and then refused to raise the tariff in accordance with the Concession\u2019s legal framework to take account of the devaluation. The Claimants also argue that Resolution 602/99 does not specifically mention a temporary payment or loan, that Dr. Deep\u2019s scenario requires capital infusions from the Claimants which are not required or authorized by the Concession\u2019s legal framework, that his scenario ignores the risk-allocation formula provided by the Concession\u2019s legal framework, and that Dr. Deep should have conducted an extraordinary tariff review as provided by that legal framework. In addition, they have challenged various elements of Dr. Deep\u2019s methodology, such as the uncollectibility rates he assumed in calculating tariff revenues.30\n\nClaimants\u2019 Comments on the Final Report, \u00b6\u00b650-57 and 58-65.\n\n50.\n\nOn the other hand, Argentina strongly protests the notion of providing an interest-free loan, arguing first that such action is nowhere required or even suggested in the legal framework of the Concession and second that it is unreasonable and unrealistic to expect that a government, facing the worst crisis in the country\u2019s history, would make an interest-free loan of ARS 132.6 million to AASA, which after all is a private company. Furthermore, since Dr. Deep relied heavily on language in Resolution 602/99 to justify the governmental provision of temporary liquidity relief, Argentina questions strongly the validity of that approach since Resolution 602/99 was never formally approved by the Argentine Government. It also argues that the increases in tariffs required by the Deep scenario would have been unrealistic and infeasible in view of the high levels of poverty experienced by the Buenos Aires\u2019 population at the time of the crisis. Argentina also argues that Dr. Deep errs in relying on Resolution 602/99 as a manifestation of the \"equilibrium principle\" in view of the fact that the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability found that the principle was absent from the regulatory framework. It further contends that Dr. Deep also errs by in effect performing an expropriation valuation when the Tribunal had determined in its Decision on Liability that no expropriation had taken place.\n\n51.\n\nThe parties are correct that neither the Concession\u2019s legal framework nor Resolution 602/99 imposes a specific obligation on Argentina to provide a one-year, interest-free loan to AASA or an obligation on the investors to make an additional capital infusion into AASA. The sudden devaluation of the Argentine Peso in 2002 subjected AASA to a significant shock because the costs of servicing its foreign debt had suddenly ballooned while its tariffs could not be adjusted immediately and its capital expenditure plan remained unchanged. AASA therefore experienced a liquidity crisis. It is that crisis that the regulator and the concessionaire would have had to work together to resolve through negotiation in a \"without measures\" scenario. To suddenly raise tariffs 87%, as the Claimants suggested at one point in the proceedings, might have been justified by the legal framework but was unfeasible for both political and functional reasons. A massive increase in tariffs in the midst of one of the worst financial crisis in Argentina\u2019s history would have generated enormous political and popular opposition. Moreover, a full tariff review necessary to any change in tariffs would require significant time and technical expertise to accomplish. Thus, in the circumstances of the crisis faced by Argentina a reasonable regulator would face a major problem in deciding how to provide AASA with relief of its liquidity problem that was both immediate and would not provoke insurmountable public and political opposition.\n\n52.\n\nAccording to Dr. Deep, a regulator would have found a partial answer in Resolution 602/99, particularly section 3.3 of Appendix A on adjustment in tariffs caused by changes in the parity of the Peso. That provision stated: \"Should the ARS/USD parity change, such change shall be transferred to the tariff. Any resulting income shall at least cover the difference between the flows of debt service (denominated in USD) arising from the variations in the exchange parity and the scenarios that would have taken place absent the exchange parity variation for the period pertaining to the immediate twelve following months.\" The provision does not state *how* such change is to be transferred to the tariff. It thus grants the Regulator a certain degree of flexibility in arriving at a solution to the liquidity crisis faced by AASA. However, Resolution 602/99 does stipulate three reasonable principles that the regulator is to follow: 1) any tariff adjustment should at least provide sufficient revenue to cover increases in debt service caused by changes in the dollar-peso parity; 2) the provision applies only for the following twelve months; 3) the decision on tariff modification had to be made within 30 days. Thus, this provision provided liquidity relief that was both immediate and temporary. Its purpose was to grant relief until a full tariff review could be accomplished. At the same time in the event that the tariff adjustment was insufficient, the investors in AASA would make up the short fall by contributing additional capital. Thus, both Argentina and the AASA\u2019s investors would share the burden of assisting AASA through its liquidity crisis. Drawing on this provision, Dr. Deep developed the without measures scenarios whose fundamental elements were the four steps listed above.\n\n53.\n\nAn evaluation of any counterfactual scenario requires the Tribunal to enter the realm of the hypothetical. Based on his expertise, and in light of the legal framework, Dr. Deep has developed a scenario hypothesizing what a fair and equitable regulator would do in the situation that Argentina faced at the time of the crisis and afterwards. While the parties have objected to various aspects of Dr. Deep\u2019s scenario, neither of the parties has provided this Tribunal with another equally detailed and convincing scenario of how a reasonable regulator intent on according fair and equitable treatment to AASA would have behaved. More important, the Tribunal considers that both Argentina and the Claimants would have had strong reasons to take the measures suggested by Dr. Deep in his scenario or similar measures. Argentina would have extended the temporary relief in order to assure the continuation of a vital public service. The Claimants, encouraged by Argentina\u2019s concrete response to its liquidity crisis, would have contributed additional capital for sound financial reasons. First despite being highly leveraged, AASA would still have had positive equity, making it valuable for the Claimants to continue to operate with valid expectation of an eventual return on their investment. Second the Claimants were also guarantors of AASA\u2019s borrowings from the multilaterals. Thus, whether or not they stayed invested in the project, they would still be liable to the multilateral lenders. Third, the Claimants had good prospects of recovering their investments with a profit if they stayed invested in AASA. Although both parties have objected to certain elements of the Deep scenario in their pleadings in these cases, the parties\u2019 litigation positions are not reflective of what a reasonable regulator and a reasonable operator would have done in the circumstances. In the view of the Tribunal, a confrontational scenario in **all probability** would not have existed if Argentina had fulfilled its obligation of fair and equitable treatment. On the other hand, the fulfillment by Argentina of its obligation of fair and equitable treatment would in **all probability** have fostered cooperation between the parties to achieve a solution of the kind suggested by Dr. Deep\u2019s Model.\n\n54.\n\nHow then should the Tribunal evaluate the scenario developed by Dr. Deep? The Tribunal believes that in the absence of a competing, more plausible scenario, it need only find that Dr. Deep\u2019s scenarios is a reasonable hypothesis of what a regulator, intent on fair and equitable treatment of AASA, would do in a comparable situation. The Tribunal believes that the without measures scenario satisfied the three principles that would guide a reasonable regulator intent on according fair and equitable treatment to AASA. The scenario assures the continuation of an important public service, preserves the entity providing that service, and is the product of shared sacrifice between the investors and the Argentine state.\n\n55.\n\nThe Tribunal believes that the scenario developed by Dr. Deep meets these criteria and that it is reasonable. The scenario assures the continued provision of vital water and sewage services to Argentina\u2019s largest urban area. To enable it to provide that service, it preserves the continued existence of AASA, which contrary to Argentina\u2019s characterization in its pleadings, is not just an ordinary private company but a heavily regulated entity providing a vital public service to millions of people. And finally, the Deep scenario, as pointed out in Dr. Deep\u2019s *Final Report,* reflects a partnership relationship between AASA and the Argentine government in that the ultimate solution requires mutual sacrifice by both sides. In view of the reasonableness of the Deep scenario, the Tribunal concludes that AASA would have *in all probability* survived if Argentina had accorded the Claimants\u2019 investment fair and equitable treatment and that Argentina\u2019s actions in failing to accord such treatment caused the financial losses sustained by the Claimants. Moreover, while Resolution 602/99 may or may not be legally binding, it was nonetheless, as the product of an agency of the Argentine Government, strong evidence of how a reasonable regulator would act in the situation that AASA and the regulators faced at the time of the Argentine crisis. Additionally, it is significant that ETOSS applied Resolution 602/99 in its dealings with AASA before 2002. The Tribunal therefore believes that Dr. Deep was justified in using Decision 602/99 to build his scenario to determine the losses sustained by the Claimants.\n\n56.\n\nFinally, contrary to Argentina\u2019s objection, Dr. Deep was not engaged in making an expropriation valuation. The construction of a without measures scenario was only the first step in his proposed methodology. He then had to value the Claimants\u2019 investments in a \"with measures\" scenario and finally to subtract the value of the latter from the value of the former in order to arrive at a value of the loss sustained. Dr. Deep correctly determined that the \"with measures\" scenario resulted in a complete loss of the Claimants\u2019 investments. Their value was therefore zero. That amount would then be subtracted from the value to be attributed to the various elements of the Claimants\u2019 investment had Argentina accorded them fair and equitable treatment. Thus the conceptual framework for the valuation process in a case of denial of equitable treatment is quite different from that of an expropriation case.\n\n**IV. Calculation of the Claimants\u2019 Losses**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**A. In General**\n-----------------\n\n57.\n\nBoth parties have argued their positions thoroughly and professionally. The Tribunal has carefully reviewed all the submissions to reach the conclusions below. Considerations of judicial economy suggest, however, that the Tribunal can dispense with dealing with arguments raised by the parties which have no impact on the outcome. Accordingly, the parties\u2019 arguments in the award are summarily described and addressed only to the extent that they are relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s findings.\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimants assert five individual elements of loss as a result of Argentina\u2019s treaty violations: 1) loss on AASA\u2019s debts that the Claimants had guaranteed; 2) in the case of Suez, losses on future management fees (after 2002); 3) also in the case of Suez, losses on unpaid management fees earned before 2002; 4) losses on the Claimants\u2019 equity investments in AASA; and 5) losses on unpaid dividends due to the Claimants as shareholders of AASA. Each of these five elements of loss will be considered in turn.\n\n**B. Losses on Guaranteed (\"Sponsored\") Debt**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nIn order to secure sufficient capital to undertake the extensive investments contemplated by the Concession Contract and related legal framework, AASA engaged in significant borrowing, both locally and internationally, in the early years of its existence. Multilateral financial institutions proved to be an important source of such loans because they were willing to lend to AASA for long periods of time, ranging from eight to twelve years, and because their prevailing rates of interest were advantageous. The Claimants asserted during the merits phase of the arbitration that loans of comparable duration were not available within Argentina, and the Respondent did not furnish any convincing evidence to the contrary. The loans, however, were with one exception denominated in US dollars31 and had floating rates of interest tied to LIBOR. In November 1994, AASA borrowed a total of USD 272.5 million in three tranches from the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an affiliate of the World Bank; in March 1996 it contracted a second loan from the IFC for USD 213 million, payable in two tranches; in July 1997 it secured a loan of ECU77 (approximately USD 77 million at the time) from the European Investment Bank (EIB); and in August 1999 it borrowed USD 215 million in two tranches from the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB). AASA\u2019s total borrowings from the multilaterals amount to USD 777.5 million.\n\nOne loan from the European Investment Bank, contracted in July 1997, was denominated in ECUs, with the face amount of ECU 77 million, approximately USD 77 million at the time.\n\n60.\n\nThe fact that the loans were payable in dollars presented a financial risk to AASA since its income was entirely in Argentine currency, which at the time was pegged to the US dollar by law. If, for any reason, Argentina should decide to abolish the peg and devalue its currency, as it in fact did during the financial crisis, AASA would experience a serious inability to service its international debt. It was because of this risk caused by the fact that its debt obligations and its revenues were in different currencies that the multilaterals required certain shareholders of AASA to guarantee the loans that the multilaterals made to AASA. Each of the Claimants, along with *Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires S.S.,* also an AASA shareholder, did in fact execute such loan guarantees (known as Sponsor Support Agreements) in favor the multilaterals. The share of each such AASA shareholder Sponsor in the debt guarantees as of December 31, 2001 was as follows: Suez 46.99%; AGBAR 29.41%; Vivendi 8.89%: AWG 5%; and Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires 9.71%. Thus, the Claimants jointly guaranteed 90.29% of AASA\u2019s debts to the multilateral institutions.\n\n61.\n\nWhen Argentina did in fact abolish the link of the dollar to the peso and thereby significantly devalue its currency and when the Argentine government refused to allow AASA to increase its tariffs, AASA was unable to service its international loan obligations. The multilaterals therefore activated the Sponsor Support Agreements, which required the guaranteeing AASA shareholders to inject additional funds (through subordinated loans) to AASA to meet its guaranteed debt obligations. In January 2003, in response to the IDB\u2019s deficiency notice, the AASA shareholders made an initial payment to AASA to enable it to meets its IDB obligations. On July 15, 2004, since AASA was still unable to service its guaranteed debt (sometimes referred to as its \"Sponsored Debt\"), AASA, its multilateral creditors, and the guaranteeing shareholders reached a broader agreement, as part of which the Sponsors made another payment to allow AASA to buy back part of its secured debt. Finally, in 2005 and 2006, because AASA was unable to make any debt payments, the secured lenders triggered the rest of the debt guarantee. The multilateral lenders and the debt guarantors then negotiated an agreement of March 9, 2006 by which the latter purchased the remainder of AASA\u2019s secured debt at a discounted price.\n\n62.\n\nThe total amount paid to the multilaterals by all Sponsors to extinguish their debt guarantee obligations was USD 329,817,707. Of this amount, the Claimants in these cases made payments to the IDB in January 2003 of USD 5,556,622, to the IFC, IDB, and EIB of USD 58,549,281 in July 2004, and to the IFC, IDB, and EIB of USD 233,686,505 in March 2006, for a total debt guarantee payments to all multilaterals of USD 297,792,408. There appears to be no dispute among the Claimants, the Respondent, and Dr. Deep on these amounts, except for the fact that the Respondent did not include in its calculations the legal fees of approximately USD 557,000 incurred by the Claimants in making the March 2006 Purchase Agreement. Dr. Deep considered these legal fees as part of the losses sustained by the Claimants as a result of Argentina\u2019s actions and therefore included them in the amount of loss on debt sustained by the Claimants.32 The Tribunal agrees with Dr. Deep on this point.\n\n*Final Report,* \u00b6324, footnote 143.\n\n63.\n\nWhereas the calculations of other elements of loss, such as the loss on equity, of necessity require the formulation of a hypothetical situation that posits what the Claimants\u2019 assets would have been worth if Argentina had accorded the Claimants fair and equitable treatment, such a hypothesis need not be deployed to determine the loss on sponsored debt since the amounts that the Claimants paid to the multilaterals are known exactly. The Claimants\u2019 losses on guaranteed debt are therefore actual, liquidated losses, not potential hypothetical losses. The Claimants, Dr. Deep, and the Tribunal accept the amount paid as the starting point in determining the amount of the Claimants\u2019 losses on guaranteed debt. However, in actualizing the values of those losses as of December 31, 2012, Dr. Deep and the Claimants have arrived at differing results. To actualize the losses, Dr. Deep assumes that each of the dollar denominated costs incurred by the Claimants in fulfillment of the debt guarantees accrues interest at the six-month Eurodollar deposit rate, as recorded by the Federal Reserve System of the United States, compounded semiannually from the end of the month in which each loss was incurred until the end of December 2012. Applying that methodology, Dr. Deep concluded that the value of the Claimants\u2019 losses on guaranteed debt, actualized to the end of December 2012, amount to USD 357.4 million.33 The Claimants, however, assert their collective losses on guaranteed debt, actualized to the end of December 2012 amount to USD 390.4 million.\n\n*Final Report,* \u00b6\u00b6263 and 397-399\n\n64.\n\nThe difference in the two calculations appears to be due to the fact that the Claimants actualized the amount paid from the date of payment until the date of termination of the Concession at AASA\u2019s weighted average cost of capital, not the six-month Eurodollar rate compounded semiannually. The Claimants seem to have chosen this method of computation on the grounds that their payments on the debt guarantees were in effect contributions to AASA\u2019s equity capital. The Tribunal does not agree with this characterization. The payments made by the Claimants to the multinationals were in satisfaction of a debt obligation, originally of a contingent nature, that had come into being because of Argentina\u2019s actions. Had those actions never occurred, the Claimants would have had no current obligation to make payments to the multilaterals. When each Claimant made such payment, they sustained a loss. In compensating them for their losses, the Tribunal must seek to place them in the position they would have been if no such loss had occurred. In order to do that, the proper approach is to determine the total amount that each paid to the multilateral and then actualize those amounts from the time of payment to the present by use of the compounded six-month Eurodollar rate as Dr. Deep has done in his *Final Report.*\n\n65.\n\nIt is to be noted that Argentina did not specifically contest the use of compound interest in Dr. Deep\u2019s calculations. The Tribunal believes that strong reasons, both economic and legal, justify the application of compound interest. First the goal of international law on compensation for violations of international obligations is to place the injured party in the position that such party would *currently* have been if the injury had never taken place. Compound interest is more effective at achieving that result than is simple interest. Second, international tribunals manifest a growing tendency to apply compound rather than simple interest in damage calculations.34 Third, it is standard practice in business and finance when calculating financial returns and losses to apply compound interest precisely because financial and economic experts believe it more accurately reflects economic reality than simple interest.\n\nE.g. *TotalS.A.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case ARJ3/04/1), Award, November 27.2013.\n\n66.\n\nAlthough Argentina does not dispute the amount of payments made by the Claimants to the multilaterals to extinguish AASA\u2019s sponsored debt, it does reject the Claimants\u2019 assertion that Argentina is responsible to compensate the Claimants for the resulting losses they incurred on AASA\u2019s sponsored debt. Its principal argument in this respect is that financing AASA\u2019s development with US dollar-denominated loans that had to be serviced in US dollar payments was highly risky in view of the fact that AASA\u2019s revenues were entirely in Argentine Pesos, a phenomenon that the Respondent has characterized as a \"currency mismatch.\" Had the Claimants chosen to finance AASA with the more prudent method of using Peso-denominated loans, the Respondent argues, AASA would have been able to weather the financial crisis and the Claimants would never have incurred the losses on debt that they allege. Accordingly, Argentina argues that having deliberately chosen to use the highly risky method of Dollar-denominated loans, the Claimants, not Argentina, should bear the negative results when that risk occurs.\n\n67.\n\nAny investment has risks. Indeed, risks are inherent in the investment process. Thus, just because an investment presents a risk does not mean that such investment is not protected by the relevant bilateral investment treaty or the applicable customary international law. The Tribunal can find no basis either in the Concession regulatory framework or in international law for excluding sponsored debt from the protection provided by the BITs, on the ground of the risk it bears. On the other hand, taking account of risk in valuing the loss of an investment is of course totally appropriate and is standard practice in finance and in law. But with respect to the payments made on guaranteed debts, the Tribunal is not seeking to value an investment in AASA made by the Claimants in the past but rather it is seeking to actualize to the present time the amount of known, liquidated, actual losses sustained by each Claimant in the past. As a result of Argentina\u2019s actions in failing to accord the Claimants\u2019 investments fair and equitable treatment, AASA was unable to service its debt and the Claimants were therefore required to make debt guarantee payments. Had Argentina met its treaty obligations to the Claimants\u2019 investment by following a course of action similar to the one proposed by Dr. Deep, AASA would have been able to meet its obligations to creditors and the multilaterals would never have activated the debt guarantees. The Claimants\u2019 losses on debt were therefore a direct consequence of Argentina\u2019s treaty violations.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal has determined that the total amount of such loss incurred by all debt sponsors, is USD 357.4 million, actualized to December 31, 20 1 2.35 The four Claimants in these cases together sustained 90.29% of that total, and the remaining 9.71% was paid by the *Banco de Galicia,* an AASA shareholder that is not a Claimant in these proceedings. The share of the individual Claimants in sponsored debt guarantees as of December 31, 2001 was as follows: Suez 46.99%; Vivendi, 8.89%; AGBAR, 29.41%; and AWG 5%. Applying these same percentages to allocate the total estimated loss on sponsored debt of USD 357.4 million, actualized to December 31, 2012, the Tribunal concludes that the amount of the loss on guaranteed debt sustained by each of the four Claimants is as follows: Suez 187,870,445; AGBAR, USD 117,583,905; Vivendi, USD 35,543,057; and AWG USD 19,990,471. Thus, the total amount of the losses on sponsored debt sustained by all four Claimants as of November 1, 2014 is USD 360, 987, 923.\n\nFor purposes of the pleadings in these cases, the parties were asked to actualize amounts claimed up to December 31, 2012. Dr. Deep\u2019s calculations in his *Final Report* were also made as of that date.\n\n69.\n\nNotwithstanding the amounts that this Tribunal may award the Claimants for these and other losses, Argentina argues that such awarded amounts should be reduced by the \"benefits\" granted to AASA throughout the renegotiation process following the outbreak of the financial crisis. Specifically, according to Argentina, these benefits fall into two categories. The first consists of payments made by Argentina on a loan the Inter-American Development Bank had made in 1989 to Argentina for the benefit of the then state-run Buenos Aires water and sewage systems and which AASA, as part of the privatization process, agreed to service by reimbursing Argentina for debt service payments that it made to the IDB. AASA did in fact make such payments from the time it agreed to this arrangement until January 2002, when its financial situation no longer permitted it to continue to make such payments. At that point, the Argentine State, which was liable on the loan obligation to the IDB made regular debt payments pursuant to the terms of the loan. By December 2012, it alleges that it made total payments to the IDB of USD 129.1 million, which when actualized to present value as of December 31, 2012 were equivalent to USD 147.2 million. The second category of claimed benefits granted to AASA includes the unpaid fines imposed by ETOSS, the regulator, on AASA for its breaches of various legal and regulatory obligations. The total amount of such fines as of December 31, 2001 was USD 10.4 million.\n\n70.\n\nIn neither its written nor oral pleadings does Argentina advance a principle of international law that supports its contention that the above amounts should be deducted from any amounts that the Tribunal may decide to award the Claimants for injuries to their investments. At the hearing on damages, counsel for Argentina did assert that such deduction is justified for \"basic equity reasons\" but did not elaborate on the meaning and application of equity concepts in the context of these cases.36 The Tribunal rejects Argentina\u2019s claim that the amounts that it paid on a pre-existing IDB loan for which it was primarily liable should be deducted from any compensation that the Tribunal might award to the Claimants. The cause of AASA\u2019s inability to reimburse Argentina for its payment on the IDB loan obligation, for which Argentina was the primary obligor, was the sudden decline in AASA\u2019s financial situation. That decline was directly attributable to Argentina\u2019s actions in denying the Claimants fair and equitable treatment as required by the relevant BITs. Had Argentina acted fairly and equitably toward those investments, as proposed earlier in this award, AASA would have had sufficient cash flow to meet its debt obligations, including the reimbursements for servicing the IDB loan repayments. Further, to reduce the amount of the compensation awarded to the Claimants for their losses on sponsored debt would amount to denying the Claimants full compensation, as required by international law, and amount to allowing Argentina to benefit from the violation of its treaty obligations.\n\n\"What we say is that if we\u2019re going to adopt a criterion where we recognize Claimants and what they paid with regard to loans made by multilateral organizations, because of basic equity reasons, we must also recognize what the Argentine State paid to those multilaterals and to deduct from whatever was paid by Claimants that which was paid by the Argentine Republic.\" Transcript of the Hearing on Damages, Thursday, September 19, 2013, p. 112, lines 13-20.\n\n**C. Losses on Management Fees**\n--------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe pre-qualification bidding rules governing the award of the Concession required bidding groups to include a Technical Operator who had experience in operating a water and waste water service in a city with a minimum of 500,000 inhabitants and to demonstrate that it had served at least two million persons. The Technical Operator was required to have a minimum equity stake of 25% of AASA\u2019s voting shares throughout the period of the Concession. The role of the Technical Operator was to oversee the technical, financial, and economic management of the Concession and to provide AASA with know-how, experience and technology, elements that seemed to have been lacking in the management of the water and sewage systems of Buenos Aires while it was a state-run enterprise. The apparent purpose of the requirement stated above was to give Argentina some assurance that any concessionaire would not only invest the necessary financial resources, but would also provide these essential, intangible assets.\n\n72.\n\nThe investors that were ultimately awarded the concession to operate the water and sewage systems of Buenos Aires selected Lyonnaise des Eaux, later renamed Suez, as AASA\u2019s Technical Operator. In April 1993, Lyonnaise des Eaux and AASA entered an \"Agreement for Management Control and Technology Transfer and Know-how,\" (\"Management Contract\") designating Lyonnaise des Eaux as the Concession\u2019s Technical Operator. This Agreement, which was embodied in the Concession Contract as Annex IX, required the Technical Operator, among other things, to \"audit the technical, economic and financial aspects of the Company\u2019s management\" and \"make available to the Company all its know-how, including its experience, technology, and knowledge in the operating management of companies engaged in the provision of potable water and sewage public utilities, in every area within its scope of activities,\" including the corporate strategy, technical, commercial, financial, administrative, legal, work policy, and personnel organization, and public and international relations areas.37 The Agreement also provides that \"[t]he Company shall pay Operator in consideration for the obligations... six percent (6%) of the Company\u2019s gross operating margin. For such purpose, the gross operating margin is defined as the difference between the operating income, excluding the value added tax, and operating expenses...\"38 It further stipulated that \"[a]ll payments for the benefit of the Operator shall be made in US dollars..,\"39 The Agreement also provided that any delay in the payment of earned management fees would entail a penalty interest rate of LIBOR plus 5%.40 Pursuant to the Revised Bidding Rules all of the terms of the Concession Contract, including its Annexes, were subject to the approval of the appropriate Argentine government authorities. In fact, the Argentine government did approve the Concession Contract, along with the annexed Agreement for Management Control and Technology Transfer and Know-how and the amount of fees to be paid were considered a legitimate operating cost for purposes of calculating the Concession\u2019s tariffs.\n\nConcession Contract, Annex IX, Part 1, Article I and Part 2, Article VI.\n\nConcession Contract, Annex IX, Part 4, Article VIII.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n73.\n\nBecause of financial difficulties, AASA was unable to pay a portion of the management fee earned by Suez in 2001. As AASA encountered increasing financial difficulties as a result of the Argentine crisis, it ceased to make such payments for lack of sufficient cash flow. In fact, AASA did not pay management fees to Suez from 2002 until Argentina terminated the Concession in 2006. As a result, Suez is claiming compensation for two aspects of its loss on management fees as a result of Argentina\u2019s treaty breach: (1) the amount of earned but unpaid management fees due as of the beginning of 2002, and (2) the amount of future management fees that Suez would have earned from 2002 until 2023 if Argentina had accorded AASA fair and equitable treatment as required by the applicable BIT.\n\n74.\n\nArgentina opposes Suez\u2019s entire claim or management fees. It argues that the Management Contract was a mere commercial contract, not an \"investment\" covered by the relevant BIT, and that therefore claims relating to the contract are outside the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. Argentina also argued that the Decision on Liability does not specifically mention management fees and that therefore \"this is not the appropriate procedural opportunity for the Claimants to reargue this issue.\" It also argues that Suez mismanaged AASA and that payment of management fees is therefore unjustified. Further, it protests that payment of management fees leads to double payments to Suez since management fee payments were included as proj ected costs and therefore were taken account of in calculating AASA\u2019s tariffs. Dr. Deep was unsure of the legal status of the claim for management fees and therefore computed them on a contingent basis in his *Final Report.*\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal has concluded that Suez\u2019s claim for unpaid management fee is justified by both a substantive economic analysis and on a formal legal basis. Economically, the management Contract was not a separate transaction, as the Respondent contends, but was an integral part of Suez\u2019s investment in AASA as covered by the BIT and the ICSID Convention. The Concession\u2019s legal framework required one of the significant investors to be designated the Concession\u2019s Operator. It was normal and necessary for that relationship to be embodied in a Management Contract such as the one Suez executed with AASA. Further, the legal framework prohibited such a contract from being held by a party that was not an investor in AASA and required that at least one substantial investor serve as the Concession\u2019s Operator. A management contract was therefore a *sine qua non* for any group seeking to invest in AASA. The Concession\u2019s legal framework clearly conceived of the Management Contract as an integral part of the Claimants\u2019 investment in the Concession. A similar situation existed in *Total S.A. v. Argentina.41* In that case, in response to Argentina\u2019 opposition to Total\u2019s claim for damages resulting from lost technical fees, the Tribunal stated:\n\n\"In any case the Tribunal does not consider that Total\u2019s claim for its fees as technical operator is a \"separate\" claim that may be termed ancillary, incidental or additional to the claim submitted for its losses in respect of its stake in TGN. Rather, it is an integral part of that principal claim. The right of Total to earn fees as a Technical Operator of TGN derives directly from Total\u2019s position as an investor which has made a direct investment in TGN..,\"42\n\n*Supra* note 34.\n\nIbid.,\u00b6192.\n\n76.\n\nThe Management Contract being an integral part of the Claimants\u2019 investment, there is no need to review whether the Management Contract in and of itself constitutes an investment for purposes of the ICSID Convention and the France-Argentina BIT. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal nevertheless notes that the Management Contract falls within the definitions given to that word by the applicable BIT in this case and by tribunals interpreting the ICSID Convention, which does not itself define the word investment, in that it possesses the principal attributes of investments usually required by tribunals: 1) contribution of resources, 2) participation in the risks of the transaction, 3) duration of performance, and 4) contribution to the economic development of the country.43\n\nC. Schreuer, *The ICSID Convention, A Commentary,* 2nd Edition, pp. 128 ff.\n\n77.\n\nIn defining the term \"investment,\" the France-Argentina BIT sets down an important condition: \"it being understood that the said assets shall be or shall have been invested and, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the related provisions laid down in conformity with the legislation of the Contracting Party in whose territory... the investment is made..,\"44 The Management Contract conformed to this condition since it was required by regulation of the Argentine state and was annexed to the Concession Contract that had been negotiated, reviewed, and approved by Argentina\u2019s governmental authorities. Although Argentina acknowledges that the bidding rules did require the designation of a \"Concession Operator\" from among the investors contributing twenty-five percent or more of the capital in the Concession, it argues that the bidding rules did not provide for or require that the Operator be compensated for playing its assigned role and that therefore the Tribunal should not consider the contract as an item of loss in determining the compensation owing to Suez.\n\n\"[E]n el entendimiento que dichos activos deben ser o haber sido invertidos *y,* respetando las disposiciones del presente Acuerdo, los derechos relativos definidos de conformidad con la legislaci\u00f3n de la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio o zona mar\u00edtima se efect\u00fae la inversi\u00f3n...\" \"[E]tant entendu que lesdits avoirs doivent \u00eatre ou avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 investis et, dans le respect des dispositions du pr\u00e9sent Accord, les droits y aff\u00e9rents d\u00e9finis conform\u00e9ment \u00e0 la l\u00e9gislation de la Partie contractante sur le territoire ou dans la zone maritime de laquelle l'investissement est effectu\u00e9...\"\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects Argentina\u2019s argument on this issue for three reasons. First, the Argentine regulatory authorities knew and approved of the Management Contract and its compensation provisions. The Argentine regulator included the Management Contract as an Annex to the Concession Contract, never contested the payment of compensation to Suez, and accepted that such compensation be included as a legitimate cost in the calculation of the Concession\u2019s tariffs. Second, the Management Contract was not an ordinary commercial agreement, made at the discretion of the AASA shareholders. On the contrary, AASA entered into it as a result of the legal mandate that a substantial shareholder in AASA be designated an Operator with important responsibility. It was therefore normal and indeed implicitly legally required that its responsibilities be defined in a lawful, enforceable contract. Third, given the nature of those responsibilities and the importance to the Concession and to the future of the water and sewage systems of Buenos Aires of the transfer of modern management and technology, things that the system had clearly lacked in the past, it was natural and appropriate that Suez be compensated for what it was to provide and that such compensation would be additional to the profits it would make as an AASA shareholder. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the loss on management fees is an appropriate item to be considered in awarding compensation to Suez on account of Argentina\u2019s failure to accord it the promised treatment under the France-Argentina BIT. The Tribunal must now calculate the amount of that loss.\n\n79.\n\nAt the outset of that exercise, it is important to recall that the France-Argentina BIT requires only that Argentina treat Suez\u2019s investments fair and equitably. It does not require that Argentina enforce the Contract or create conditions that would allow the Management Contract to be strictly enforced in accordance with its provisions. Nor does it remove ordinary commercial risk that such a contract would face during the thirty-year period of the Concession. In constructing a but-for scenario, an important initial question is to determine the priority that management fees would have in AASA\u2019s income stream. Specifically, are management fees to be treated as Concession costs, as Suez asserts, so that Suez\u2019s claim to management fees would stand on equal basis with those of other AASA creditors? Or should they be considered as profits, as Argentina argues, so that Suez\u2019s claim for fees would be subordinated to those of other creditors and stand on equal footing with the income claims of other AASA shareholders? Dr. Deep finds a middle ground which assumes that the management fees would not be paid until there were sufficient cash flows to pay all the creditors but they would be paid to Suez ahead of the dividend claims of other investors. He also relies on the Management Fee Subordination Agreements that the guarantors of AASA\u2019s debt made with the multilaterals to support his view that the management fees should be placed above dividend payments but behind debt payments. This solution seems entirely proper to the Tribunal.\n\n80.\n\nIt will be recalled, however, that the Management Contract specifically provided that any delay in the payment of earned management fees would entail a penalty interest rate of LIBOR plus 5%.45 In his *Final Report,* Dr. Deep chose not to include this interest rate in calculating the total accrued but unpaid management fees, although he had done so in his *Preliminary Report.* He argued that since the management fees were to be viewed as a return on Suez\u2019s investment and since interest is not ordinarily paid on dividends, accrued but unpaid management fees in this case should be treated like unpaid dividends. Suez strongly disagreed with Dr. Deep\u2019s decision on this question, arguing that in calculating the total amount of accrued management fees lost to Suez as a result of Argentina\u2019s treaty violations the specified interest rate in the Management Contract for delayed payment of management fees should be applied. It points to the fact that the interest provision had been approved by both Argentina and the other shareholders in AASA when they approved the Management Contract at the commencement of the Concession.\n\nConcession Contract, Annex IX, Part 4, Article VIII.\n\n81.\n\nThe Tribunal, however, considers that the approach recommended by Dr. Deep is what a reasonable regulator in the circumstances would have permitted. If Argentina\u2019s treatment of the investments in this case had replicated that scenario, such treatment, in the judgment of the Tribunal, would have complied with the treaty requirements of fair and equitable treatment. As indicated earlier, the scenario is based on a principle of shared sacrifice, which the Tribunal believes is implicit in the relationship upon which the Concession was founded. In accordance with that scenario which sought at one and the same time to allow the survival of AASA and still provide the needed service at a reasonable cost to the people of Buenos Aires, AASA would not have sufficient cash flow to pay the management fees until the year 2018. In 2018, Dr. Deep estimates that the amount of management fees earned in that year would have been ARS 55,072,717 and the total amount of cumulative unpaid management fees was ARS 706,268,570. In that year, AASA would have had sufficient cash flow to pay the ARS 67,508,034 in management fees, enabling it to cover the current year\u2019s fee of ARS 55,072,717 and ARS 12,435,317 as payment toward the cumulative management fees owed. In the remaining years of the Concession, AASA would have been able to pay both the management fees due in each year as well as to pay completely the total amount of unpaid cumulative management fees. The total management fees paid under this scenario during the years 2018 to 2023 when discounted to 2001, the date of Argentina\u2019s measures that violated the treaty, would have been ARS 20,021,752. The much higher amount claimed by Suez results from a series of assumptions that it has made concerning the magnitude of the management fees during the Concession, the applicable discount rate for calculating the present value of management fees as of 2001, and the time when the management fees are converted into dollars. The Tribunal considers Dr. Deep\u2019s assumptions to be more reasonable in the circumstances that AASA would have faced in the later years of the Concession. While from a strictly contractual analysis, unpaid management fees were to accumulate interest at a rate of LIBOR + 5%, the source of those fees was closely tied to the equity that Suez had invested in AASA; therefore, a reasonable regulator, like Dr. Deep, could have reasonably likened the unpaid fees to unpaid dividends, which usually do not accumulated interest and thus obliged Suez to forego the payment of interest on unpaid management fees. Moreover, the obligation to pay such accumulated interest would have placed an untenable stress on AASA\u2019s already stressed liquidity situation. To relieve that stress, it was reasonable for a regulator, following the precedent of AASA\u2019s multilateral creditors, to require Suez to waive the interest on unpaid fees, particularly since AASA\u2019s precarious liquidity was to some degree accentuated by the highly leveraged method chosen by Suez and its partners to finance the Concession.\n\n82.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal finds that the total management fees paid under the above-described scenario during the years 2018 to 2023, when discounted to 2001, the date of Argentina\u2019s measures that violated the treaty, would have been ARS 20,021,752. This amount, if paid in 2001, would have compensated Suez, for the loss of management fees caused by Argentina\u2019s breach of the BIT with France. The Tribunal must next update or \"actualize\" this amount to an appropriate value as of December 31, 2012, as Dr. Deep and the parties were instructed to do for purposes of the pleadings in these cases. Dr. Deep chose to undertake such updating in a three step process: 1) Until March 2006 (when the Argentine government terminated the Concession), he assumed that the Argentine-peso denominated amounts corresponding to such losses would have remained in the same or a similar enterprise. During this period such investments would have earned a risk-adjusted rate of return equal to the estimated internal rate of return of the Flow to Sponsors, compounded annually; 2) In March 2006, the Argentine-peso denominated value of these investments would be converted into US dollars at the extant spot exchange rate; 3) From March 2006 to December 2012, the resultant US dollar-denominated amount would be updated using semi-annual compound interest at the six-month Eurodollar deposit rate. Applying this methodology, Dr. Deep determined the value of Claimant Suez\u2019s loss on management fees when actualized in US dollars as of 2012 would amount to USD 18,686,869. While the Tribunal understands and appreciates the logic underlying this methodology, the Tribunal does not agree with it. In particular, it does not accept Dr. Deep\u2019s assumption in step 1) that the Claimant Suez, having been compensated in pesos for the loss sustained in 2001, would have continued to hold assets in pesos until 2006. The Tribunal considers it far more likely that Claimant Suez would have converted those pesos into US dollars or other stable currency in 2001 at the then prevailing exchange rate. More generally, the amount of ARS 20,021,752 represents compensation for a loss. Accordingly, Claimant Suez should not be required to assume the currency risk in the same kind of assets that have been previously injured by governmental action. Rather, it should be free to use that compensation in any way it sees fit. At the same time, it should be noted that Claimant Suez, while arguing that the methodology of actualization should convert the loss into US dollars as of the end of 2001, also contends that the proper method of actualization would also apply a rate of interest equivalent to the weighted average cost of capital (WAAC) of assets similar to AASA, instead of the much lower Eurodollar rate. The Tribunal rejects this contention by Claimant Suez. First, it should be recalled that although the Claimants always maintained that AASA was an investment in US dollars with a regulated return that was guaranteed in US dollars, the Tribunal has consistently disagreed with this view. Second, to invest in Argentina, one needs to hold funds in Argentine pesos, and in the process take on the currency risk of an Argentine investment. An investor could not convert funds out of pesos and still expect to earn a weighted average rate of return that is based upon an investment in Argentina and denominated in Argentine pesos. Third, the damage estimation seeks to compensate the Claimants for the loss of their future profits in Argentina in a lump sum in 2001 based on the assumption that they would wish to leave the water utility due to lack of fair and equitable treatment by the Argentine government. They therefore cannot justifiably claim a rate of return that is only possible if they had stayed invested in a water utility in Argentina. And finally, it will be recalled that to bolster its contention that a conversion into dollars should take place in 2001, not 2006, the Claimant Suez had argued that a reasonable investor who had been paid a large amount of funds in pesos would immediately convert those funds to US dollars, rather than hold them in pesos for another five years. While agreeing with that contention, the Tribunal also considers that no reasonable investor, having converted the funds to dollars, would then reinvest them in peso-denominated assets after the devaluation had taken place.\n\n83.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal chooses to actualize Claimant Suez\u2019s loss of ARS 20,021,752 in 2001 by immediately converting them into US dollars in 2001 and then actualizing that value by applying the Eurodollar rate, compounded semi-annually until November 1, 2014. The Tribunal has thus determined Suez\u2019s loss on management fees on that date to be USD 26,084,421.\n\n**D. Losses on Earned but Unpaid Management Fees**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Management Fee payments in the amount of USD 6,992,000 had been approved by the Management of AASA before December 2001, (i.e. before the enactment of the offending measures by Argentina) but had not been paid by the end of 2001. They also contend that these payments have been due since then. The Tribunal must therefore decide whether such amounts should be included in the damages to be awarded to Claimant Suez.\n\n85.\n\nIn confronting this question, it should be borne in mind that the Tribunal is not in the position of a court enforcing the terms of the Management Contract but rather of an international Arbitral Tribunal seeking to determine how a reasonable regulatory authority would treat the earned but unpaid management fees in order to accord the Claimants\u2019 investment fair and equitable treatment as required by treaty in the circumstances of this case. It should also be borne in mind that the immediate cause of the non-payment of these management fees was not any measure taken by Argentina in violation of its treaty obligations, but rather the highly leveraged financial situation of AASA during the period *prior* to Argentina\u2019s illegal measures in 2001. That financial situation was created by the actions and decisions of AASA\u2019s shareholders, particularly its Operator, Suez. They therefore bear responsibility for AASA\u2019s inability to pay the management fees when they became due before 2001.\n\n86.\n\nIn building a but-for scenario, the Tribunal therefore must try to answer the difficult and somewhat speculative question of how a reasonable regulator seeking to accord fair and equitable treatment to the investments of the Claimants would treat the nearly USD 7 million debt that AASA owed to Suez for unpaid past management fees for the period before 2001. In the difficult circumstances faced by Argentina during its financial crisis, the Tribunal does not believe that a reasonable regulator would provide for the payment of such unpaid management fees for whose nonpayment the Argentine government was not responsible. Recalling the three fundamental principles that the Tribunal posited as guiding a reasonable regulator, payment of such fees would seem to fall outside that framework. Such payment would not be needed to assure the continuation of a needed public service, would not protect the continued existence of AASA, and was not essential to a continued working relationship with AASA. A reasonable regulator would with justification distinguish between the payment of future management fees after the crisis and the payment of unpaid past management fees. The provision of sufficient funds to pay the former was necessary to retain an Operator and assure the continued public service, while the payment of past due management fees was not. As a result of these considerations, the Tribunal does not believe that a reasonable regulator would provide for an accommodation of the tariff structure to pay the past due management fees and that its unwillingness to do so would not constitute a violation of Argentina\u2019s obligations to treat Suez fair and equitably. The Tribunal therefore dismisses the claim of Suez for unpaid management fees for the years before 2001.\n\n**E. Losses on Equity**\n-----------------------\n\n87.\n\nThe four Claimants in the present cases owned 76.74% of the equity in AASA as of December 31, 2001, with Suez owning 39.93%, AGBAR owning 25.01%, Vivendi owning 7.55%, and AWG owning 4.25%. Of the remaining equity, Banco de Galicia held 8.26%, the firm\u2019s Employee Stock Ownership Program held 10%, and the International Finance Corporation held 5%. As a result of the measures taken by Argentina, the Claimants\u2019 equity in AASA is now worthless. In order to determine an appropriate remedy under international law for the loss of the Claimants\u2019 equity, the Tribunal must determine the value of that equity had Argentina accorded it fair and equitable treatment as required by the applicable treaties.\n\n88.\n\nThe meaning of \"value\" in this context is \"market value,\" that is, what a willing buyer would pay a willing seller. Arbitral tribunals have defined the term \"value\" by drawing on the notion of a market transaction between willing buyers and sellers. Thus, one useful definition of market value, elaborated by the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in *Starrett Housing Corp v Iran* is \u2018the price that a willing buyer would pay to a willing seller in circumstances in which each had good information, each desired to maximize his financial gain, and neither was under duress or threat, the willing buyer being a reasonable person\u2019.46 The problem in applying this standard to the present cases, as in many investor-state disputes, is that no market for the Claimants\u2019 equity exists to which one can readily refer. As a result, tribunals and others concerned with the valuation of injuries to investments must have recourse to a variety of techniques whose purpose is to arrive at an approximation of what that fair market value would be if such a fair market existed in fact.\n\n*Starrett Housing Corp v. Iran,* 16 Iran-USCTR 112,201 (Final Award)\n\n89.\n\nTribunals appear to use one of three general approaches to valuation: 1) the market or sales comparison approach, by which tribunals refer to a market price for an identical or similar asset; 2) the asset-based or cost approach, by which tribunals arrive at a valuation by looking at the cost elements, such as book value of an asset; and 3) income capitalization approaches, often referred to as \"Discounted Cash Flow\" (DCF) approaches, which hold that the value of an asset or business is best determined by calculating the stream of income or benefits that it will yield its owner and then discounting that stream of income to present value using an appropriate discount rate.47 The first approach is inapplicable in the present cases because, as noted above, a market or other sales comparison for the Claimants\u2019 equity simply does not exist. The second, usually applied in valuing physical assets, is also inappropriate since the Claimants\u2019 equity did not give them a claim on the physical assets of the water and sewage system managed by AASA, all of which were owned by the Argentine state. Under the Concession Contract and the related legal framework, the Claimants\u2019 equity in AASA entitled them only to a share in the cash flow over the thirty years that AASA would generate income from the operation of the water and sewage systems to which Argentina had entrusted it. It is for this reason that the Tribunal has concluded that some variation of an income capitalization approach is proper to value the Claimants\u2019 lost equity. The Tribunal is well aware that, although financial professionals generally favor the use of income capitalization methods over other techniques, many tribunals have been skeptical about their use in investor-state disputes.48 One of the reasons for that skepticism is that claimants in some cases were seeking to apply income capitalization techniques to enterprises that did not have an established or firm record of earnings. That situation does not apply to AASA. Created in 1993, AASA had a solid record of earnings for some seven years before the financial crisis in 2001, a record of earnings that provided an ample basis of data for valuing AASA and the Claimants\u2019 equity through the use of income capitalization methods.\n\nFor a full discussion of each of these approaches and the ways in which tribunals have used them, see Irmgard Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law,* pp. 185-315 (2009).\n\nSee e.g. *CME Czech Republic BVv. Czech Republic,* Final Award on Damages, March 14.2003 (2006), 9 ICSID Reports 246, \u00b6359. See also the concurring opinion in that case of the late Professor Ian Brownlie.\n\n90.\n\nThe income capitalization or Discounted Cash Flow approach to valuation has generated several distinct methodologies, each of which is capable of yielding different results in specific cases. One such methodology is the Free Cash Flow Method, which both parties\u2019 experts have employed but with markedly different results. The method first requires a determination of a firm\u2019s \"Free Cash Flow,\" which consists of the firm\u2019s revenues, less its operating expenses, taxes paid, capital expenses and changes in working capital. Free Cash Flow represents the cash that is available for distribution to all the firm\u2019s investors, a group that consists essentially of its lenders and its equity shareholders. The two groups do not participate equally. Debt payments in the form of interest and principal payments are paid first. Payments to equity in the form of dividends or retained earnings are made only if any funds remain after the debt obligations for that period have been fulfilled. In order to arrive at the value of the firm, the Free Cash Flow must then be discounted to present value using a cost of capital that represents the blended cost of raising capital in the form of debt and equity, a cost known as the \"Weighted Average Cost of Capital\" (WACC). The cost of debt represents the interest cost at which lenders are willing to lend to the firm in the form of loans or bonds, while the cost of equity represents the expected rate of return that equity investors expect from their investment. One important factor that affects a firm\u2019s cost of debt capital is the fact that corporate tax law usually allows a firm to deduct the payment of interest from its total tax obligations, known as the \"debt tax shield,\" which has the effect of lowering a firm\u2019s cost of debt capital and of increasing potentially the amount of cash flow available for distribution to equity holders, thereby increasing their return on equity.\n\n91.\n\nDrawing on scholarly authority, Dr. Deep has argued convincingly that the Free Cash Flow method is not appropriate for valuing a firm such as AASA and therefore for valuing the Claimants\u2019 equity in that firm. In his *Final Report* to the Tribunal, he advances four arguments in support of that view. First, the application of the Free Cash Flow valuation method usually entails the use of a constant discount rate for cash flows in all periods when in fact the project\u2019s debt-to-equity ratio is dynamic and constantly changing, which means that the respective cost of debt and equity is also changing. As Professor Benjamin C. Esty of the Harvard Business School has written:\n\n*Most project finance investments, however, are not simple valuation problems.* *One feature that makes them complex is the fact that project leverage changes over time.* For the typical project, the ratio of debt to total capitalization starts at 0%, rises to somewhere in the neighborhood of 60%-85%, and then falls back down to 0% in later years. Because the cost of equity is a function of leverage, both it and the WACC will change as leverage changes. Thus the use of a single discount rate for all years is inappropriate... (emphasis supplied).49\n\nBenjamin C. Esty, \"Improved Techniques for Valuing Large-Scale Projects,\" *The Journal of Project Finance,* Spring 1999, p. 9, quoted inDr. Deep\u2019s *Final Report,* \u00b6135.\n\n92.\n\nProfessor Esty describes AASA\u2019s situation precisely. Based on an initial capitalization of USD 120 million, it proceeded to borrow USD 777.5 million, thus raising its ratio of debt to total capitalization from 0% to over 85%. Had AASA survived, that ratio would have eventually dropped to 0% once again by 2018 when its debt to the multilaterals would have been paid off.\n\n93.\n\nA second factor that makes the application of the Free Cash Flow method to AASA problematic is the nature of its debt structure, and particularly the fact that it issued two different kinds of debt, sponsored debt guaranteed by the AASA shareholders, and unsponsored debt which was not guaranteed. Debt and equity are not clearly delineated because the major shareholders in AASA also guarantee part of its debt. This factor creates overlap in the role of equity and sponsor-secured debt, which has significant implications for their riskiness and therefore their cost.\n\n94.\n\nThird, the complexity of what should be counted as debt makes the definition of the leverage ratio complex and difficult to ascertain in advance, data that is important for the normal application of the Free Cash Flow method of valuation.\n\n95.\n\nFinally, the benefits of the tax shield, which is also an inherent element of the Free Cash Flow method, cannot be realized by AASA for many years because its long-term debt obligations will prevent it from having taxable income for those years. Over the remaining life of the Concession, the tax shield will therefore have a differing and changing impact on AASA\u2019s cost of capital and therefore on the value of the firm and the equity owned by the Claimants. For the above mentioned reasons, Dr. Deep concluded that the application of the Free Cash Flow method is inappropriate to value AASA as a firm and the equity owned by the Claimants, a conclusion with which the Tribunal agrees. He therefore proposed the application of two other income capitalization methods: the Adjusted Present Value Method and the Flow to Equity Method. As will be seen, the separate application of these two methods independently would arrive at two valuations of AASA that were nearly identical.\n\n96.\n\nIn order to apply these methods, it is first necessary to project the cash flows of the firm. Whereas the Claimants made cash flow projections in United States dollars, the Tribunal believes all cash flows, including revenues, capital and operating expenses, taxes, working capital, depreciation, and interest payments should be expressed in Argentine pesos. All of AASA\u2019s revenues - that is, its cash flows - were in pesos and, as the Tribunal noted in its Decision on Liability, its legal framework, unlike those of certain other foreign investors in Argentina at the time, did not provide for the payment, adjustment, or conversion of tariffs into US dollars or other foreign currencies. However, once the value of losses on equity have been determined as of 2001, the proper method of actualization is to convert that amount immediately into US Dollars and then to actualize them to present value by applying a risk free rate as was done in actualizing the losses on sponsored debt and management fees. The reason for this approach is that an investor is entitled to full compensation for its injury and ought not to be prejudiced by the effects of devaluation that takes place between the date of the wrongful act and the determination of the amount of compensation. Several ICSID cases support this position.50 However, Dr. Deep, once having determined the value of the Claimants\u2019 lost equity as of 2001, chose to maintain those values in pesos until 2006, when he converted them into US Dollars. On the other hand, at the hearing on damages, he agreed that an injured foreign investor who received compensation in Pesos for a loss in 2001 would in all probability have converted those Pesos to US Dollars immediately. As noted above, the Tribunal disagrees with Dr. Deep\u2019s approach because it improperly subjects the Claimants to currency risk for five years, thus reducing substantially the compensation to which they are entitled under international law.\n\nE.g. *Total* at *supra* note 34; *SAUR International S.A. v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/4), Award, May 22, 2014, \u00b6315.\n\n97.\n\nIn order to arrive at the value of the Claimants\u2019 equity in 2001, it is first necessary to make a complex series of projections of the revenues and expenditures of AASA from the time of the treaty violations until the contractual end of the Concession in 2023. Dr. Deep agrees with the Tribunal on this point and has made his calculations accordingly. Thus, in projecting the portion of capital and operating expenses incurred in pesos, these amounts were converted to their nominal value in constant pesos through four inflation factors - the consumer price index, an index of wholesale prices, an index of wage prices, and the sum of foreign exchange and US inflation rate variations \u2014 in a manner similar to that used by the parties\u2019 experts. One important issue in this regard that was strongly contested by the Claimants was the appropriate index to apply in order to determine the impact of inflation on AASA\u2019s regulated rate of return between the period when the US dollar-Argentine peso parity collapsed (2001) and the subsequent quinquennial tariff review (2003) and therefore on the value of the asset base used in determining the tariff that would balance costs and revenues. Indeed, this issue and the method of actualization discussed above were the only ones that the Claimants objected to in Dr. Deep\u2019s methodology.\n\n98.\n\nIn order to update AASA\u2019s asset base value and cash flows, Dr. Deep employed the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is based on a basket of items that are purchased by ordinary households in Argentina. Dr. Deep chose the CPI for two reasons. First, he argued that the Claimants\u2019 assets invested in AASA to be financial assets and asserted that the CPI was the appropriate index to be used in determining the nominal rate of return on financial assets. Second, he pointed out that water regulators in the United Kingdom employed the Retail Price Index (RPI), an inflation measure similar to the CPI, to adjust the asset bases of regulated entities and that the Argentina\u2019s regulatory system was drawn from that of the United Kingdom. The Claimants strongly opposed the use of the CPI, arguing instead that a cost-based index, such as the Producer Price Index (PPI), was more appropriate for measuring the impact of inflation on the asset base of a public utility like AASA. They consider that a cost-based index is best able to evaluate the impact of inflation on AASA\u2019s operations and pointed to the fact that the Concession Contract provides that in extraordinary tariff revisions reference is to be made to official indices \"...which should reflect as much as possible variations in wholesale prices...\". Cost indices, like the PPI and not the CPI, are best able to reflect changes in wholesale prices. And finally, regardless of the standard practice in the United Kingdom, Claimant Suez argued that no evidence was offered that regulators in Argentina used the CPI to adjust the asset base of other public utilities. At the hearing, it was not challenged that no Argentine utility has ever had its asset base updated by inflation according to the Consumer Price Index used by Dr. Deep. Rather, utilities have always used either Producer Price Index or another cost-based index, which looks at how the actual costs of the utility have been affected by inflation. Moreover, Dr. Deep admitted that the Argentine regulator, UNIREN, applied a cost-based index while reviewing the asset base of a utility. He also admitted that the reason why UNIREN followed that approach was because it accurately reflected the true cost structure of a particular utility. Further, Dr. Deep acknowledged that in every five-year tariff review, the regulator would look at the actual cost structure of the company.\n\n99.\n\nDespite these arguments, the Tribunal supports the indices used by Dr. Deep as indicative of what a reasonable regulator would do in a comparable situation. The purpose of applying the CPI in Dr. Deep\u2019s model is to adjust the value of the *asset* base to take account of inflation. It is more appropriate to use CPI to adjust asset value than a producer price index whose purpose is to adjust costs. More important, the periodic review of tariffs provided by the Water Decree would be adjusted to reflect changes in costs and thereby increase AASA\u2019s cash flow. Consequently, adjusting the asset base for cost inflation, when such inflation in costs will also be accounted for in the periodic tariff reviews, would amount to double compensation for the same inflated costs and would therefore be improper. The Tribunal therefore accepts this aspect of Dr. Deep\u2019s methodology and rejects the Claimants\u2019 arguments on this point.\n\n100.\n\nIn order to apply the above-mentioned valuation methods, it is also necessary to make a further preliminary determination on AASA\u2019s cost of capital in Argentine pesos. Such a determination is necessary to arrive at the appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of the cash flows denominated in Argentine pesos. Such calculation must utilize the cost of debt and the cost of equity to what is applicable to raising these sources in capital in Argentina by a company operating in Argentina. With respect to the cost of debt, Dr. Deep advised the Tribunal that the cost of debt for a water utility such as AASA in 2004 was 16.42%, which represents a credit spread of 231 basis points **{i.e.** 2.31%) over sovereign bonds denominated in Argentine pesos. With respect to the cost of equity, Dr. Deep has concluded that the cost of equity for a firm similar to AASA but without debt **{i.e.** an \"unlevered firm\") would be 18.58%. The cost of equity is dependent on the degree to which a firm is levered since leverage affects the degree of risk. The degree of leverage in AASA - defined as the value of AASA\u2019s non-secured debt relative to the value of the aggregate firm - ranges from 35.72 % in 2002 to zero in 2018 when AASA is estimated to have paid off all of its debt. Accordingly, during that time period, AASA\u2019s cost of equity ranges from 19.78% to 18.58%. The Tribunal considers that Dr. Deep\u2019s estimated cost of capital for both debt and equity are reasonable. Having made these initial assumptions and determinations, Dr. Deep then proceeded to value the Claimants\u2019 equity by applying the two recommended methods - the Adjusted Present Value Method and the Flow to Equity Method.\n\n101.\n\nIn applying each of these methods, Dr. Deep determines that the value of AASA as a firm in 2001 was ARS 1296.3 million according to the Adjusted Present Value Method and ARS 1293.5 million according to the Flow to Equity method. He then averages the two values to arrive at a value for AASA of ARS 1294.9 million in 2001. Having arrived at a value for the firm as a whole, one must then determine the value of the equity portion of its capital structure. The total firm value in 2001 was comprised of three components: 1) the present value of the equity, that is the value of the dividends to be paid to the shareholders; 2) the present value of Sponsor-secured *{i.e.* guaranteed) debt, that is, the present value of the payments to be made to sponsor-secured debt holders; and 3) the present value of non-sponsor secured debt, that is, the present value of payments to non-sponsor secured debt holders. This relationship may be represented by the following formula:\n\nVfirm =Vequity +Vssdebt +Vnsdebt.\n\n102.\n\nDr. Deep calculated that the present value of the stream of payments to non-sponsored debt holders in 2001 was ARS 547.7 million and that the present value in that same year to the sponsored debt holders was ARS 729.7 million. The total value of all debt, sponsored and non-sponsored was therefore ARS 1277.4 million, leaving a residual value for AASA\u2019s equity of only approximately ARS 17.5 million in 2001. While AASA thus would have had a positive value if Argentina had followed the \"without measures\" or \"but-for\" scenarios proposed by Dr. Deep, the Tribunal also concludes that the measures Argentina did take during the crisis would have resulted in a negative cash flow to AASA\u2019s equity holders in 2002 and it would have remained negative throughout the life of the Concession. In short, the Claimants\u2019 equity would have been worthless.\n\n103.\n\nThe total amount of the loss of all the equity holders in AASA as of 2001 was approximately ARS 17.5 million. As noted above, the four Claimants in this case held 76.74% of AASA\u2019s equity. Their total loss in 2001 was therefore ARS 17.5 million x.7674 = ARS 13.4 million. In updating this amount to November 1, 2014, Dr. Deep used the same principles that he applied in calculating Suez\u2019s loss on management fees discussed earlier in this award, specifically, he assumed that the amount of such loss would be maintained in Argentine pesos until 2006. As noted above, the Tribunal disagrees with that approach. Specifically, it determined that the appropriate actualization methodology is to convert the amount of the loss on equity, *i.e.* ARS 13.4 million, into US dollars as of 2001 at the then prevailing exchange rate and thereafter carry it forward using the semi-annual Eurodollar rate, compounded. Applying this methodology, the value of the Claimants\u2019 loss on equity in US dollars as of November 1, 2014 totaled USD 17,466,706. On the basis of their individual equity holdings in AASA, their respective losses as of November 1, 2014 were USD 9,088,423 for Suez, USD 5,692,498 for AGBAR, USD 1,718,447 for Vivendi, and USD 967,338 for AWG.\n\n**F. Losses on Unpaid Dividends**\n---------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants are also asking for compensation for declared but unpaid dividends, valued as of December 30, 2012, at USD 4.6 million. As retained earnings, they constituted part of the equity of AASA. The Tribunal considers that the value of unpaid dividends is included in the value of the shareholders\u2019 equity in AASA, which was determined above, and that to grant recovery of such separate amounts for unpaid dividends would be to allow the Claimants a double recovery. The Tribunal therefore rejects the claim for unpaid dividends.\n\n**G. Conclusions on Total Losses**\n----------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nBased on the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that the total losses sustained by each of the four claimants in these cases as of November 1, 2014 is as follows:\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **SUEZ** |\n| Loss on Guaranteed Debt | | | USD 187,870,445 |\n| Loss on Management Fees | USD 26,084,421 |\n| Loss on Equity | | | USD 9,088,423 |\n| TOTAL | | | USD 223,043,289 |\n||  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| | |\n\n| **AGBAR** |\n| Loss on Guaranteed Debt | | | USD 117,583,950 |\n| Loss on Equity | | | USD 5,692,498 |\n| TOTAL | | | USD 123,276,448 |\n||  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| | |\n\n| **VIVENDI** |\n| Loss on Guaranteed Debt | | | USD 35,543,057 |\n| Loss on Equity | | | USD 1,718,447 |\n| TOTAL | | | USD 37,261,504 |\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| **AWG** |\n| Loss on Guaranteed Debt | USD 19,990,471 |\n| Loss on Equity | USD 967,338 |\n| TOTAL | USD 20,957,809 |\n\nTOTAL LOSS TO ALL CLAIMANTS: **USD 404,539,050** as of November 1, 2014.\n\n**V. Costs**\n------------\n\n106.\n\nAs part of its award in these cases, the Tribunal is obligated under the applicable rules to allocate the costs of these proceedings among the parties. Because one case brought by Claimants Suez, AGBAR, and Vivendi is governed by the ICSID Convention and Rules and the other case brought by Claimant AWG is governed by the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal must apply two different rules of differing contents to each case. With respect to the ICSID case, Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention is the relevant provision. It provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\n107.\n\nThe Convention thus recognizes three types of costs: 1) expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings; 2) fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal; and 3) the charges for use of the ICSID facilities. However, the Convention gives the Tribunal complete discretion with respect to allocation of these costs among the parties and provides no guidance on how that discretion is to be exercised. The only references to costs in the ICSID Rules are to be found in Arbitration Rules 28 and 47 and they give no precise guidance on how costs are to be apportioned. Arbitration Rule 28 empowers the Tribunal to decide at any stage of the proceeding what proportion of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and for the use of the ICSID facilities shall be paid by individual parties and further to decide how other related costs are to be borne by the parties. Arbitration Rule 47 on the content of awards, merely states that the award shall contain \"... any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.\" Moreover neither the ICSID Convention nor the Rules specify exactly what items the word \"costs\" and \"expenses\" includes.\n\n108.\n\nThe 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules51 are somewhat more specific on the standards for cost allocation. Article 40(1) states:\n\n[... ] the costs of the arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\nIn addition, Article 38 defines \"costs\" to include specified list of items as follows:\n\n(a) The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n(b) The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n(c) The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(d) The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n(e) The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n(f)...\n\nBy virtue of Article 8(3)(b) of the Argentina-UK BIT, the version of the UNCITRAL rules under which this case was brought is \"... the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade *as then in force* meaning in force at the time the case is commenced. The version of the UNCITRAL Rules in force at the time this case was commenced is that of 1976. The Tribunal notes that the Claimants\u2019 Cost Submission of October 21.2013, referred to the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal further notes that the principles embodied in the latter Rules do not materially differ from the principles that inform the applicable 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n109.\n\nAs can be seen, the content of the two sets of rules is different. As a result, the Tribunal will decide the allocation of costs in the UNCITRAL case and the ICSID case separately.\n\n**A. Allocation of Costs in the UNCITRAL Case of** ***AWG v. Argentina***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n110.\n\nClaimant AWG alleges that it has incurred total expenses of USD 1,215,947.82 in connection with its case and requests that the Respondent reimburse it the entire amount. It bases it claim on its interpretation that Article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules52 \"...establishes a clear principle that the unsuccessful party shall bear the costs of the arbitration, subject to a tribunal\u2019s discretion to apportion costs only if the circumstances of the case so warrant (and which therefore should be carefully described in an eventual award).\"53\n\nAs explained *supra,* Claimants, in their Costs Submission, drew the Tribunal\u2019s attention to Article 42(1) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, which corresponds, almost *verbatim,* to Article 40(1) of the 1976 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Cost Submission, October 21.2013, p. 3.\n\n111.\n\nIn order to ascertain the meaning of the text of Article 40(1), the Tribunal must interpret the words \"in principle.\" The Oxford English Dictionary (3rd edition 2007) defines \"in principle\" as \"theoretically; in general but not necessarily in individual cases.\" Thus, one may interpret article 40(1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as providing that in general the unsuccessful party is to bear the reasonable costs of the arbitral proceeding but not necessarily in the individual case where a tribunal determines that \"circumstances\" exist to apportion them in some other way between the parties. The Rule does not specify what those \"circumstances\" may be. One may argue that the rationale for the rule is that customary international law requires that \"full reparation\" be paid to the party injured by a breach of an international obligation and that, as stated by the tribunal in the ICSID case of *Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* \" [t]here is little doubt that the legal costs incurred in obtaining the indemnification must be considered part and parcel of the compensation in order to make the whole party who suffered the loss and had to litigate to obtain compensation.\"54 To deny the successful party recovery of costs incurred pursuing its case would have the effect of denying that party's \"full reparation\" as required by international law. On the other hand, one may also argue that the meaning of \"unsuccessful party\" is not completely clear since it may refer to the party has been unsuccessful in the case or party that has been unsuccessful with respect to specific issues decided in that case.\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), Award, May 20, 1992, \u00b6209.\n\n112.\n\nArticle 40(1) permits the Tribunal to depart from the application of the rule that the unsuccessful party must bear the costs of the arbitration if the circumstances of the case justify it. However, it does not specify what such circumstances may be. Caron and Caplan in their treatise on the UNCITRAL Rules offers one such justification for departing from the blanket application of Article 40(1) in investor-state cases:\n\nOne factor that may mitigate against apportionment of costs based on a party\u2019s success in arbitration is the novelty of the issues being decided. This factor may be particularly relevant in the context of investor-state arbitration which may present new and unsettled questions of international law. It may therefore not always be reasonable to require the losing party to pay costs when it was difficult, if not impossible, for the party to predict the potential success of a novel claim.55\n\nDavid Caron and Lee M. Caplan, *The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary* (2d Ed. 2013), pp. 865-77, referring to Article 42(1) of the 2010 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.\n\n113.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the situation described by Caron and Caplan exists in the present case. This case has raised many novel and complex issues of fact and law, as evidenced by the fact that of the three basic treaty violations (expropriation, full protection and security, and fair and equitable treatment) alleged by the Claimants, they were able to prevail on only one, and that the Claimants will gain in an award an amount of compensation far less than they originally claimed\u2014and then only after voluminous pleadings and a lengthy hearing on damages that raised many difficult questions of finance. The case also generated novel and complex procedural issues, such as the right of third parties to make *amicus curiae* submissions and the proper procedure of selecting and guiding a Tribunal-appointed independent financial expert. Moreover, while the pleadings on record in this case are vast, counsel for both parties conducted themselves according to the highest professional standards. Certainly it would have been difficult, if not impossible, for a reasonable party to have predicted the potential success of claims arising out of the complex facts of the Argentine crisis in this case, let alone the precise amount of compensation that should be awarded. Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that there is reason to depart from the general principle advanced by Article 40(1). It therefore directs that AWG and Argentina each bear their own costs and share appropriately in the administrative expenses of the proceeding and of ICSID.\n\n**B. Allocation of Costs in the Case of** ***Suez et al v. the Argentine Republic*** **(ICSID No. ARB/03/19)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nClaimants Suez, Vivendi and AGBAR allege that they have incurred expenses totaling USD 20,732,568.74 in this case and they request that the Tribunal allocate the entire amount to the Respondent for repayment to the Claimants. The specific amounts requested by each Claimant individually are as follows: Suez: USD 11,419,813.16; AGBAR: USD 7,153,021.55; and Vivendi: USD 2,159,734.03. They assert that Argentina should reimburse them for all their costs in these proceedings because 1) the Claimants have established their claim in this case that Argentina did violate the applicable BITs and therefore committed an international wrong; 2) there is a growing trend in investor-state arbitration for tribunals to require the losing party to pay the costs of the proceeding; and 3) during the course of these proceedings Argentina engaged in various unjustified actions which lengthened and complicated the arbitral process and therefore increased its costs.\n\n115.\n\nAt the outset, it is to be reiterated that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention gives the Tribunal greater discretion in the allocation of costs than does Article 4 (1) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. It is also to be noted that the practice of ICSID tribunals on this question is by no means settled and that historically the position taken by the majority of ICSID awards is that each side is to pay its own costs. As noted in the Tribunal\u2019s discussion above on the allocation of costs **in AWG v. Argentina,** this case raised both legal and factual issues of great complexity. The claims and arguments advanced by the Claimants were by no means frivolous but neither were the defenses and counterarguments of the Respondent. For these reasons and those set forth in the above discussion of cost allocation **in AWG v. Argentina,** and taking into account the novelty and complexity of the issues raised during this lengthy proceeding, as well as the great discrepancy between the substantial costs incurred by the Claimants and the relatively more modest costs of the Respondent, the Tribunal has determined that Claimants Suez, AGBAR and Vivendi, on the one hand and the Respondent on the other, should share equally in the administrative expenses of this proceeding and of ICSID and that they should each bear the individual costs that they have each incurred.\n\n**VI. Award in the UNCITRAL Case of** ***AWG v. Argentina***\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders the following AWARD:\n\nArgentina shall pay to the Claimant **AWG** the following amounts as compensation for the damages caused in respect of AWG\u2019s investments in Argentina, in breach of Article 2 of the Argentina-UK BIT, as decided in the Decision on Liability of this Arbitral Tribunal of July 30, 2010:\n\n**A. Losses on Guaranteed Debt (\"Sponsored Debt\")**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**USD 19,990,471,** plus interest from and after November 1, 2014.\n\n**B. Losses on Equity**\n-----------------------\n\n**USD 967,338,** plus interest from and after November 1, 2014.\n\n**C. Costs**\n------------\n\n**AWG** on the one hand, and Argentina on the other, shall share equally in the costs of this arbitral proceeding56 and each shall bear individually the other legal costs and expenses that they have incurred.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses, ICSID\u2019s administrative charges, and all other direct expenses in connection with the proceeding are paid out of the advances periodically made by the parties in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d). The ICSID Secretariat will provide the parties with a Financial Statement of the cases\u2019 account. Any remaining balance in the account will be reimbursed by ICSID to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n**D. Total Amount of the Award in** ***AWG v. Argentina***\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe total amount of the award is **USD 20,957,809, plus interest** from and after November 1, 2014. The Tribunal notes the commitment of the Claimant, as expressed in the pleadings of this case, not to seek compensation in other legal proceedings for any loss already awarded and paid to them in this arbitration.\n\n**E. Interest**\n---------------\n\nOn all above amounts, compound interest shall accrue as of the date indicated for each amount, at a rate equal to the average rate of the six-month U.S. Treasury bills prevailing on such initial date, and thereafter at the subsequent six-month average interest rates of six-month U.S. Treasury bills prevailing in each following six-month periods, until payment by the Respondent. Such interest shall be compounded semi-annually.\n\n**VII. Award in the Case of** ***Suez et. al. v. the Argentine Republic*** **(ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal renders the following AWARD:\n\nArgentina shall pay Claimants **Suez, AGBAR, and Vivendi,** individually, the following amounts as compensation for the damages caused in respect of their investments in Argentina in breach of, respectively Article 3 of the France-Argentina BIT, and Article IV of the Argentina-Spain BIT, as decided in the Decision on Liability of this Arbitral Tribunal of July 30, 2010:\n\n**A. With Respect to Claimant Suez**\n------------------------------------\n\n**1.

(\"AGBAR\"),** a company incorporated under the laws of Spain, **Vivendi Universal, S.A. (\"Vivendi\"),** a company incorporated under the laws of France (together **\"Claimants\"),** and the Argentine Republic **(\"Respondent\"** or **\"Argentina\"),** (each a **\"Party\"** and together, the **\"Parties\").**\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn 21 August 2015, pursuant to Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"****),** ICSID registered an application from the Argentina for the annulment of the Award dated 9 April 2015 (the **\"Award\"),** as well as the Decision on Jurisdiction dated 3 August 2006 (the **\"Decision on Jurisdiction\")** and the Decision on Liability dated 30 July 2010 (the **\"Decision on Liability\"),** which form an integral part of the Award, rendered by the tribunal (the **\"Tribunal\")** in the case of *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. the Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19 **(\"Argentina\u2019s Application\").**\n\n4.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n5.\n\nIn its Application, Argentina seeks annulment of the Award on four grounds set out in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically claiming that:\n\na) the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\nb) the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\nc) there has been a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure; and\n\nd) the Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n6.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application also contained a request under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules for a stay of enforcement of the Award until Argentina\u2019s Application is decided.\n\n7.\n\nUpon registering Argentina\u2019s Application, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Secretary-General of ICSID transmitted a Notice of Registration to the Parties. The Parties were also notified that, pursuant to Rule 54(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated 23 October 2015, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Parties were notified that an *ad hoc* Committee composed of Professor Dr. Klaus Sachs (a national of Germany), Sir Trevor Carmichael (a national of Barbados), and Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno B. (a national of Costa Rica) (the **\"Committee\")** had been constituted. On the same date, the Parties were informed that Mr. Francisco Grob, Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee. The Parties were notified in this same letter that Prof. Dr. Sachs had been designated President of the Committee. Enclosed with the same letter, the Parties were provided with copies of the Declaration pursuant to Rules 52(2) and 6(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules signed by each member of the Committee.\n\n9.\n\nBy letter of 3 November 2015, the Secretary of the Committee asked the Parties whether they would agree to retain the services of an assistant to the President of the Committee, Ms. Susanne H\u00e4usler. Argentina and Claimants agreed to Ms. H\u00e4usler\u2019s appointment by communications of 10 and 11 November 2015, respectively.\n\n10.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held, with the agreement of the Parties, on 24 November 2015, by telephone conference. The Parties agreed that the annulment proceedings would be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006. A schedule was set for the Parties\u2019 main submissions on Argentina\u2019s Application. The Parties were also asked to agree on a date for the hearing on annulment and on a procedural schedule for the filing of their submissions concerning the continuation/termination of the stay of enforcement of the Award.\n\n11.\n\nOn 7 December 2015, the Parties informed the Committee of their agreement on the schedule for the filing of written submissions on Argentina\u2019s request for a stay of enforcement of the Award. On 9 December 2015, the Committee approved the schedule of proceedings agreed upon by the Parties and fixed a date for a hearing on Argentina\u2019s request for continuation of the stay of the enforcement of the Award.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of 4 January 2016, the Committee approved the Parties\u2019 joint proposal to schedule the hearing on annulment for 8 and 9 November 2016.\n\n**A. Procedure on Argentina\u2019s Request for a Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nAs per the agreed and approved schedule for written pleadings:\n\na) on 22 December 2015, Argentina submitted its First Brief on Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award;\n\nb) on 19 January 2016, Claimants submitted their Response to the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request to Continue the Stay of Enforcement of the Award;\n\nc) on 10 February 2016, Argentina submitted its Second Brief on Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award; and\n\nd) on 3 March 2016, Claimants submitted their Second Submission on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request to Continue the Stay of Enforcement of the Award.\n\n14.\n\nOn 23 March 2016, the Committee held an oral hearing with the Parties in Washington DC on Argentina\u2019s request for continuation of the stay of the enforcement of the Award.\n\n15.\n\nOn 25 March 2016, Claimants submitted final versions of the slides presented during their opening presentation and their responses to the Committee\u2019s questions and offered to provide copies of the legal authorities referenced but not on the record during the hearing. On 28 March 2016, Argentina submitted the slides presented during its opening presentation and its responses to the questions asked by the Committee at the hearing.\n\n16.\n\nOn 1 April 2016, Claimants provided copies of the legal authorities referenced in the slides presented by them at the hearing.\n\n17.\n\nOn 8 April 2016, Argentina submitted its comments about the final versions of the slides presented by Claimants in response to the Committee\u2019s questions and, upon leave of the Committee, Claimants submitted a brief response on 12 April 2016.\n\n18.\n\nOn 22 April 2016, Claimants submitted copies of two legal authorities, which had not been available on 1 April 2016, and upon leave of the Committee, Argentina filed its comments together with two annexes on 29 April 2016.\n\n19.\n\nOn 7 June 2016, the Committee rendered its Decision on the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, by which it dismissed Respondent\u2019s request to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award and ordered that the stay of enforcement of the Award be terminated as of the date thereof.\n\n**B. Procedure on Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment of the Award**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nAs per the agreed and approved schedule for written pleadings, as further amended by the Parties with the approval of the Committee on 1 July 2016:\n\na) on 24 February 2016, Respondent filed its Memorial on Annulment **(\"Argentina\u2019s Memorial\");**\n\nb) on 24 May 2016, Claimants filed their Counter-Memorial on Annulment **(\"Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial\");**\n\nc) on 18 July 2016, Respondent filed its Reply on Annulment **(\"Argentina\u2019s Reply\");** and\n\nd) on 12 September 2016, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Annulment **(\"Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder\").**\n\n21.\n\nOn 3 October 2016, Claimants informed the Committee that they wished to introduce a new legal authority into the record, *i.e.,* a decision issued by the US District Court for the District of Columbia on 30 September 2016 in *Republic of Argentina v. AWG Group Ltd.,* Civil Action No. 15-1057 (BAH) (D.D.C.).\n\n22.\n\nOn 7 October 2016, Respondent objected to Claimants\u2019 request to introduce a new legal authority into the record.\n\n23.\n\nOn 12 October 2016, the Committee permitted Claimants to submit the new legal authority into the record by 14 October 2016 and noted that both sides would have the opportunity to comment on it as part of their oral submissions during the hearing in November 2016.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 October 2016, Claimants submitted the new legal authority into the record.\n\n25.\n\nOn 8 and 9 November 2016, the Committee held an oral hearing with the Parties in Washington DC on Respondent\u2019s Application for annulment of the Award.\n\n26.\n\nOn 10 and 11 November, 2016, Argentina and Claimants, respectively, submitted the demonstrative exhibits used during the hearing.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter dated 18 November 2016, the Committee informed the Parties that it had no further questions for them to address in post-hearing submissions. The Parties were thus invited to submit their statements of costs.\n\n28.\n\nOn 30 November 2016, Claimants submitted the Parties\u2019 agreed revised version of the Spanish and English transcripts, which Argentina confirmed the following day.\n\n29.\n\nOn 2 and 3 December 2016, Argentina and Claimants submitted their Statement of Costs, respectively.\n\n30.\n\nThe Committee declared the proceeding closed on 1 May 2017, in accordance with Rules 53 and 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n31.\n\nThe members of the Committee have deliberated by various means of communication and have taken into consideration the Parties\u2019 entire written and oral arguments and submissions.\n\n**III. THE DECISION ON JURISDICTION, THE DECISION ON LIABILITY, AND THE AWARD**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nRespondent requests annulment of the Award dated 9 April 2015, as well as of the Decision on Jurisdiction dated 3 August 2006 and the Decision on Liability dated 30 July 2016, which it describes as an integral part of the Award.1\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b61.\n\n**A. Decision on Jurisdiction Dated 3 August 2006**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n33.\n\nIn its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal rejected all of Argentina\u2019s objections, except for one which had become moot. The Tribunal found that the dispute was of legal nature and arose directly out of Claimants\u2019 investments in the water distribution and waste water systems of the city of Buenos Aires and surrounding municipalities. The existence of a dispute resolution clause in the concession contract concluded by Aguas Argentinas S.A. **(\"AASA\"),** a company incorporated in Argentina in which Claimants were shareholders, and the Argentine Government for the operation of the water concessions did not preclude Claimants from bringing this arbitration. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, Claimants had standing to protect their interest as shareholders on their own right under the Argentina-France and the Argentina-Spain BITs, as applicable, and AGBAR was entitled to invoke the more favorable treatment afforded in the Argentina-France BIT to bring an arbitration without the need of first having recourse to the local courts of Argentina.\n\n**B. Decision on Liability Dated 30 July 2010**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Tribunal determined in its Decision on Liability that Argentina did not expropriate Claimants\u2019 investment nor did it deny them full protection and security as required by the applicable investment treaties. It found, however, that Argentina denied Claimants fair and equitable treatment **(\"FET\").** The Tribunal rejected Argentina\u2019s necessity defense, including its allegation that Article 5(3) of the Argentina-France BIT, as well as international law, exempted Argentina from its BIT obligations during times of emergency. Although Claimants had argued that Argentina\u2019s unilateral termination of the Concession also violated their rights under the investment treaties, the Tribunal rejected that claim, stating that it had no jurisdiction to judge whether Argentina\u2019s actions had breached the Concession Contract.\n\n**C. Award Dated 9 April 2015**\n-------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe Tribunal awarded damages to Claimants in excess of USD 380 million, plus compound interest. Suez was awarded USD 223,043,289 for losses on guaranteed (sponsored) debt, equity and management fees. AGBAR was awarded USD 123,276,448 for losses on guaranteed debt and equity, and Vivendi was awarded USD 37,261,504 for losses on guaranteed debt and equity. On the issue of costs, the Tribunal determined that each party should bear its own costs and that the cost of the proceedings shall be divided equally.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES\u2019 CONTENTIONS AND RELIEF SOUGHT**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nRespondent seeks the annulment of the Award, which is resisted by Claimants.\n\n**A. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Contentions**\n------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nRespondent requests annulment of the Award invoking the following grounds:2\n\n(i) The Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention);\n\n(ii) The Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention);\n\n(iii) There has been a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention); and\n\n(iv) The Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 8; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 2; Argentina\u2019s Application, **\u00b6** 3.\n\n38.\n\nIn relation to the scope of annulment proceedings, Respondent contends that the remedy of annulment seeks to preserve the integrity of the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism in all its facets, including the integrity of the tribunal, the process and the award.3\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 1-7.\n\n39.\n\nRespondent invokes four separate sets of reasons that warrant, in its view, the annulment of the Award in this case.\n\n40.\n\nFirst, Respondent claims that the appointment of Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler as director of UBS on 19 April 2006, a Swiss bank which held shares and other interests in two of the Claimants (Suez and Vivendi), and her alleged failure to disclose such appointment to the Parties to the arbitration and to properly investigate the connections between UBS and the Parties to this arbitration created justifiable doubts regarding her ability to act as an impartial and independent arbitrator under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Consequently, the Tribunal was no longer properly constituted and a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure occurred (Articles 52(1)(a) and (d) of the ICSID Convention).4\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6\u00b623-33; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b667-105.\n\n41.\n\nSecond, Respondent alleges that the Tribunal improperly applied the most-favored-nation **(\"MFN\")** clause of the Argentina-Spain BIT to a dispute settlement provision, enabling AGBAR to circumvent the 18-month local court requirement of Article X of the Argentina-Spain BIT. According to Respondent, in doing so the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, failed to state the reasons on which its decision was based and seriously departed from fundamental rules of procedure (Article 52(1)(b), (d) and (e) of the ICSID Convention).5\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6\u00b634-42; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 106-130.\n\n42.\n\nThird, Respondent claims that the Tribunal failed to state the legal standards and to consider the evidence submitted by Respondent in the context of its state of necessity defense and that the Tribunal did not consider Respondent\u2019s obligation to guarantee the human right to water. In Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal thereby failed to state the reasons on which its decision was based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).6\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6\u00b643-47; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 131-164.\n\n43.\n\nFourth, Respondent invokes reasons relating to the valuation of damages, specifically: (i) the valuation period because the Tribunal allegedly awarded damages for losses sustained after the termination of the Concession Contract while finding that such termination did not amount to a breach of the Treaty; (ii) the construction of the valuation exercise because it allegedly adopted a series of presumptions for which it gave no reasons and which contradicted other statements made by the Tribunal; and (iii) the management fees because the Tribunal awarded losses in relation to the Management Contract without having previously determined that it was a protected investment under the Treaty. In Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal thereby manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons for the Award (Article 52(1)(b) and (e) of the ICSID Convention).7\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, 48-59; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 165-219.\n\n**B. Respondent\u2019s Relief Sought**\n---------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nRespondent requests:8\n\n(i) that, pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the Arbitration Rules, the Award, as well as the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Decision on Liability which are an integral part thereof, be annulled; and\n\n(ii) that Claimants bear all their legal costs and attorneys\u2019 fees arising from this proceeding.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 235.\n\n**C. Summary of Claimants\u2019 Contentions**\n----------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nClaimants take the view that Respondent\u2019s Application is abusive, arguing that it is based on disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s findings rather than on annullable errors in the Award, and emphasize that the ICSID Convention does not allow for the substantive or *de novo* review that Respondent is seeking.9\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b61-3; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b61-6.\n\n46.\n\nFirst, Claimants consider that Respondent\u2019s arguments relating to the Tribunal\u2019s decision to reject Respondent\u2019s challenge to Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler do not satisfy the standards for annulment under either Article 52(1)(a) or (d) of the ICSID Convention. According to Claimant, no *\"egregious violations of basic principles\"* have been committed; regardless whether the approach of the *Azurix* Committee is followed or that of the *EDF* Committee, the decision stands because all challenged procedures were observed in this case and the decision is certainly not so plainly unreasonable that no decision-maker could have come to the unchallenged members\u2019 conclusion. Claimants emphasize that in their final analysis, all of the decision-makers who have heard Argentina\u2019s arguments on Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s appointment to the board of UBS have rejected them.10\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 58, \u00b6\u00b6 72-89; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 7-24, \u00b6\u00b6 25-39.\n\n47.\n\nSecond, Claimants deny that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by (i) permitting AGBAR to access arbitration without having recourse to the Argentine courts for 18 months first; or (ii) when awarding damages to Claimants. In Claimants\u2019 view, Respondent attempts to re-argue these points because it is not satisfied with the Tribunal\u2019s decision, not because the Tribunal exceeded its powers. In doing so, Respondent willfully ignores, among others, that an excess of power must be clear and obvious to be manifest and only a failure to apply the law *in toto* can lead to annulment.11\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 106-107, \u00b6\u00b6 121-122, \u00b6 135; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 44-81.\n\n48.\n\nThird, Claimants submit that the Tribunal did not depart from any fundamental rule of procedure when (i) deciding on the challenge to Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler; (ii) exercising jurisdiction over AGBAR\u2019s claims; or (iii) applying an interest rate higher than that allegedly agreed by the Parties.12 Claimants argue that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s purported nondisclosure cannot meet the standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention where, as here, the undisclosed facts would not evidence a conflict of interest or anything close to it and the applicable procedures were followed.13 Similarly, Argentina fails to identify what fundamental rules of procedure have presumably been violated by the Tribunal\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over AGBAR\u2019s claims. As for the last point, Claimants argue that the Tribunal did not disregard any alleged agreement concerning the applicable interest rate because there was none at the time the Tribunal had to render its decision and the Parties had ample opportunity to comment upon this issue anyhow.14\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, ****\u00b6\u00b6**** 142-144; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, ****\u00b6\u00b6**** 82-86\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, ****\u00b6\u00b6**** 142-143; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, ****\u00b6\u00b6**** 40-43.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 72-74.\n\n49.\n\nFourth, Claimants consider that the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons, arguing that this annulment ground requires either a total absence of reasons or a lacking in coherence preventing the reader from following it - contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s detailed reasoning as to why it (i) exercised jurisdiction over AGBAR\u2019s claims; (ii) rejected Respondent\u2019s necessity defense; and (iii) chose the valuation date, adopted the but-for scenario and awarded compensation for the management fees the way it did in its Award.15\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 158, \u00b6 164, \u00b6\u00b6 170-177; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 87-129.\n\n**D. Claimants\u2019 Relief Sought**\n-------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nClaimants request that the *ad hoc* Committee:16\n\n(i) reject Argentina\u2019s request for annulment in its entirety; and\n\n(ii) order that Argentina bear all costs and expenses incurred by Claimants in connection with the present annulment proceedings, including the fees of the Centre, the costs and fees of the *ad hoc* Committee, and Claimants\u2019 legal fees and expenses.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 135.\n\n**V. GENERAL REMARKS AND SCOPE OF REVIEW IN ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nAt the outset, the Committee wishes to make a few general remarks regarding the purpose and scope of annulment proceedings under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. As it is expressly provided in Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, ICSID awards are not subject to any appeal, and in line with this provision, it is in fact accepted by both Parties that an annulment committee does not have the power to review the merits of the Award and/or the other decisions rendered by the Tribunal. As stated in a leading commentary on the ICSID Convention, which both Parties cite in various contexts, there are two main elements distinguishing an annulment proceeding from an appeal:\n\n*\"... An appeals body may substitute its own decision on the merits for the decision that it has found to be deficient. Under the ICSID Convention, an* ad hoc *committee only has the power to annul the award. The* ad hoc *committee may not amend or replace the award by its own decision, whether in respect of jurisdiction or the merits....*\n\n*As to the second element, annulment is only concerned with the legitimacy of the process of decision; it is not concerned with its substantive correctness. Appeal is concerned with both.\"17*\n\n**AL A RA 40,** Article 52, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n\n52.\n\nIt is therefore not for this Committee to make its own assessment of the factual and/or legal questions of this case or to substitute its own views for the conclusions that the Tribunal has reached in the course of almost twelve years of proceedings.\n\n53.\n\nThe mandate of an *ad hoc* committee is strictly confined to an assessment of the five grounds for annulment provided in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. In interpreting the scope of its review under these five grounds, the Committee will take into account the intention of the drafters of the ICSID Convention in not providing for an appeal, but rather a very limited annulment proceeding, which is designed to ensure the fundamental integrity of the arbitral proceedings but must not be misused to re-litigate the case on the merits. As it has been stated in the same leading commentary on the ICSID Convention, the annulment proceeding *\"is designed to provide emergency relief for egregious violations of a few basic principles while preserving the finality of the decision in most respects.\"18* The *ad hoc* committee in *Soufraki v. UAE* referred to the *\"control of the fundamental integrity of the ICSID arbitral proceedings in all its facets,\"* which includes: (i) the integrity of the tribunal; (ii) the integrity of the procedure; and (iii) the integrity of the award.19\n\n**AL A RA 40,** Article 52, \u00b6 15.\n\n**ALARA 61, \u00b623.**\n\n54.\n\nIn this case, Respondent has invoked four annulment grounds:20\n\n(i) The Tribunal was not properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention);\n\n(ii) The Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention);\n\n(iii) There has been a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention); and\n\n(iv) The Award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6** 8.\n\n55.\n\nIn order to arrive at this Decision, the Committee reviewed and evaluated all the arguments of the Parties and the documents submitted by them in this proceeding. The fact that the Committee does not specifically mention a given argument or reasoning does not mean that it has not considered the same. In their submissions, the Parties produced and cited numerous awards and decisions dealing with matters that they consider relevant to this decision on annulment. The Committee has considered these documents carefully and may take into account the reasoning and findings of other committees on annulment. However, in coming to a decision on the matter of annulment raised by Respondent, the Committee must perform, and in fact has performed, an independent analysis of the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules, and the particular facts of this case.\n\n56.\n\nBefore entering into its analysis of the grounds advanced by Respondent, the Committee will first determine the scope of its review under the invoked grounds for annulment. In this regard, it will take into account the recognized principles of interpretation of international treaties embodied in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the **\"Vienna Convention\"),** in particular its Article 31(1) pursuant to which \"[a] *treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\"21*\n\n**AL A RA 49,** Article 31(1).\n\n**A. Proper Constitution of the Tribunal (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention)**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nRespondent submits that the annulment ground in Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention refers to the provisions on the constitution of the tribunal in Articles 37 to 40 and, *via* Article 40(2), to the qualities that an arbitrator must have pursuant to Articles 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.22\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 34; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 12.\n\n58.\n\nRespondent notes that the three authentic versions of Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention are not identical as the English version refers to persons who *\"may be relied* [upon] *to exercise independent judgment\";* the French version provides that arbitrators must *\"offrir toute garantie d\u2019ind\u00e9pendence dans I\u2019exercice de leur fonctions\";* and the Spanish version states that arbitrators must *\"inspirar plena confianza en su imparcialidad de juicio\"* Respondent submits that, in accordance with Article 33(4) of the Vienna Convention, these diverging texts shall be given a meaning that *\"best reconciles the texts, having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty.\"* In this case, Respondent argues, persons designated as arbitrators have to meet the requirements in all three versions, *i.e.,* they must be both independent and impartial.23\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 36-39.\n\n59.\n\nAccording to Respondent, a manifest lack of these qualities serves not only as a ground for a proposal for disqualification but also, upon issuance of the award, as a ground for annulment based on an improper constitution of the tribunal. In particular, Respondent notes that the text in Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention does not indicate the existence of any limitation on the powers of review of an *ad hoc* committee and claims that such limitation would be contrary to the meaning and scope of Article 52, when interpreted in accordance with Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention.24\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u201835: Argentina\u2019s Reply, 11-12 referring to **AL A RA 49,** Articles 31 and 32.\n\n60.\n\nRespondent refers to the tribunal in *Soufraki v. UAE,* which stated that the *\"object and purpose of an ICSID annulment proceeding\"* consists in *\"the control of the fundamental integrity of the ICSID arbitral process*  ***in all its facets,\"***  *i.e.,* the integrity of the tribunal, the integrity of the procedure and the integrity of the award.25 According to Respondent, this purpose would be defeated and it would be *\"inconsistent with the fundamental integrity of ICSID arbitration proceedings\"* if a party were not allowed to invoke *\"even the most serious and manifest conflict of interest\"* in annulment proceedings in a case where it had used the disqualification mechanism before.26\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 13 quoting from **AL A RA 61,** 23 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 13.\n\n61.\n\nIn addition, Respondent argues that it would be contrary to the principle of effectiveness if a party were prevented from raising an arbitrator\u2019s manifest lack of the qualities contained in Article 14(1) as a ground for annulment both in case of a failure to propose the disqualification of such arbitrator on a timely basis (by means of a waiver under Rule 27 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules) and, likewise, in case the party did make use of the disqualification mechanism.27\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 14.\n\n62.\n\nRespondent further points to the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention, which record that a motion to delete the annulment ground of an improper constitution of the tribunal as well as a motion to include a requirement to raise such issue already in the underlying proceeding before the tribunal, were discussed and defeated.28 Respondent also relies on Prof. Schreuer, who states in his commentary on the ICSID Convention that if a party has unsuccessfully used the disqualification mechanism, its right to invoke improper constitution of the tribunal as a ground for annulment *\"remains unaffected\"29*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 15 quoting from **AL A RA 106,** p. 853.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 16 quoting from **AL A RA 40,** Art. 52, \u00b6 129.\n\n63.\n\nWith regard to the annulment decision in *EDF v. Argentina,* Respondent first notes that the committee concluded that *\"the fact that an arbitrator does not meet the standard required under Article 14(1)... is also a ground on which an award might be annulled under Article 52(1)(a).\"30* Respondent notes that the *EDF* committee rejected the approach taken by the *Azurix* committee as *\"incompatible with the duty of an ad hoc committee to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral procedure\"31* As to the limitation imposed by the **EDF** committee on its power in case of a prior decision on disqualification, Respondent submits that such limitation has no basis in Article 52 or any other provision of the ICSID Convention. In particular, Respondent argues that annulment is not defined in opposition to appeal but rather in accordance with its object and purpose as determined by an interpretative exercise in which the **EDF** committee did not engage.32\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 17 quoting from **AL A RA 70, \u00b6** 127.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 92 quoting from **AL A RA 70, \u00b6** 141.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 18-20.\n\n64.\n\nFinally, Respondent claims that a distinction has to be made between a tribunal\u2019s decision on the merits of the dispute and the decision on a proposal for disqualification made by the unchallenged arbitrators or the Chairman of the Administrative Council; while the former is not subject to the review of the annulment committee, the latter expressly is - under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention. Consequently, Respondent argues that the limitations imposed on an *ad hoc* committee in relation to the merits of the dispute are not applicable in the present case.33\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n\n65.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, *\"the existence of a decision on disqualification in the original proceedings may be a factor to be considered by the annulment committee when verifying whether the tribunal was properly constituted, but such decision is not binding on the committee, nor does it curtail its powers to determine whether the tribunal was properly constituted\"* Respondent refers to the *Vivendi II* committee, which recognized that annulment committees have a *\"grave responsibility in matters of this nature\"* and *\"serve... to address this concern,\"* which relates to *\"the integrity of the ICSID process as a whole, which is the clear and undisputed concern of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\"34*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 23 quoting from **AL A RA 67, \u00b6\u00b6** 206-207.\n\n**2. Summary of Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nClaimants submit that Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention refers to a failure to comply with the provisions in Articles 37 through 40 (relating to the *\"Constitution of the Tribunal\")* and Articles 56 through 58 *(\"Replacement and Disqualification of Conciliators and Arbitrators\"),* as well as Rules 1 through 12 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules *(\" Establishment* *of the Tribunal\").35* Claimants further agree with Respondent that Article 14(1) is of relevance to this Committee\u2019s analysis.36\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 60.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 11.\n\n67.\n\nClaimants argue, however, that Article 14(1) does not set the standard of review to be applied by the Committee and that there is no provision in the ICSID Convention that would allow an annulment committee to scrutinize the decision rendered by a tribunal on a challenge *\"as though the challenge was a matter of first impression,\"* taking into account that Article 58 expressly reserves for the tribunal the right to decide on arbitrator challenges.37\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b611-12.\n\n68.\n\nClaimants refer to *\"two lines of authority\"* that have emerged on the treatment of arbitrator challenges in an annulment context; in Claimants\u2019 view, Respondent\u2019s application fails under both.38 First, Claimants refer to the approach taken by the annulment committee in **Azurix** v. *Argentina,* which held that its powers were limited to assessing whether the procedures of the ICSID Convention had been complied with. Claimants quote the *Azurix* committee\u2019s view that *\"if a party proposes a disqualification of an arbitrator under the first sentence of Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, and if that proposal is rejected in accordance with the procedure established in Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 for deciding such proposals, then it cannot be said that the tribunal was* \u2018not properly constituted\u2019 *by reason of non-compliance with the first sentence of Article 57. The Committee considers that Article 52(1)(a) cannot be interpreted as providing the parties with a* de novo *opportunity to challenge members of the tribunal after the tribunal has already given its award.\"* Claimants further cite the **Azurix** committee\u2019s finding that if a committee were to decide for itself whether or not a decision on a disqualification proposal was correct, *\"this would be tantamount to an appeal against such a decision.\"39*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 65.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 66 quoting from **A/CLA-69, \u00b6\u00b6** 280, 282.\n\n69.\n\nClaimants note that the *Azurix* committee considered exclusively the procedure for constituting a tribunal and for resolving a challenge to an arbitrator - a question distinct from the question whether an arbitrator manifestly lacked the qualities required by Article 14(1), which it considered to be reserved for the remaining tribunal members. According to Claimants, this view is supported by the fact that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention record a proposal to include an arbitrator\u2019s lack of the qualities in Article 14(1) as a ground for annulment - a proposal which was rejected.40 Therefore, Claimants argue, Respondent\u2019s resort to supplementary means of interpretation is also unsuccessful.41\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 67 referring to **A/CLA-70,** p. 852.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 18.\n\n70.\n\nSecond, Claimants refer to the approach taken by the committee in *EDF v. Argentina,* where the committee held that it was empowered to consider the substance of an arbitrator challenge in certain limited circumstances, albeit noting that in the case of an existing decision on a challenge to an arbitrator, the committee *\"does not write on a blank sheet: it is faced with existing findings of fact and assessment of those facts, as well as with an application of the law to those facts\"* Claimants further quote the *EDF* committee\u2019s finding that \"[w]*hile a committee is not bound to uphold the decision of the remaining members of the tribunal (or the Chairman of the Administrative Council), nor can it simply disregard that decision. It is limited to the facts found in the original decision. Moreover, commensurate with the principle that an* ad hoc *committee is not an appellate body, it may not find a ground of annulment exists under either Article 52(1)(a) or 52(1)(d)*  ***unless the decision not to disqualify the arbitrator in question is so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.\"42***\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, **\u00b6\u00b6** 69-70 quoting from **A/CLA-61, \u00b6\u00b6** 137, 145 (emphasis added by Claimants).\n\n71.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, the approach adopted by the *EDF* committee is fully consistent with established jurisprudence on the scope of annulment committee review; consequently and contrary to Respondent\u2019s argument, the committee did not need to engage in any further interpretative analysis of the ICSID Convention.43\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 19.\n\n72.\n\nBy contrast, Claimants consider that Respondent\u2019s interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) contradicts the object and purpose of annulment in the ICSID Convention, which is not meant to revisit the merits of any matter that was submitted to the tribunal. Claimants argue that the responsibility for ensuring that only impartial, independent and expert tribunals hear the parties\u2019 claims resides within the tribunal or with the Chairman of the Administrative Council, a framework that serves to resolve challenges as early and efficiently as possible -rather than years later after the award has been rendered. According to Claimants, this consideration also applies in the context of annulment proceedings concerning an arbitrator challenge in that a *de novo* review of the challenge would deprive the proceedings under Article 57 and 58 of any useful purpose.44\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, **\u00b6\u00b6** 13-14 referring to **A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 142.\n\n73.\n\nClaimants take the position that Respondent\u2019s proposed scheme of a *de novo* review on annulment would be inconsistent with an *ad hoc* committee\u2019s role within the ICSID framework and the purpose of annulment, which is *\"to provide a limited form of review of awards in order to safeguard the integrity of ICSID proceedings\"45* Claimants further emphasize that an annulment committee cannot hear evidence and refer to *\"settled case law\"* pursuant to which an annulment committee may not *\"substitute its own view of the law and its own appreciation of the facts for those of the Tribunal\"46*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 17 quoting from **A/CLA-90,** 41.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 17 quoting from **AL A RA 31, \u00b6** 136.\n\n74.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent\u2019s argument that this interpretation would run counter to the principle of effectivity and claim that *\"a pre-award challenge is* the *opportunity for a party to present an arbitrator challenge and to have that challenge resolved on a full evidentiary record.\"47* Likewise, Claimants reject Respondent\u2019s argument that there is a distinction between the annulment grounds in Article 52(1)(b) through (e) addressing *\"merits\"* issues that are subject to a deferential standard of review and the annulment ground in Article 52(1)(a) addressing the proper constitution of the tribunal that allegedly warrants a different standard of review. Claimants note that Respondent does not cite any authority for this distinction, which is in any event not justified because each of the issues addressed by these grounds is *\"expressly subject to the decision of an annulment committee\"48*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, **\u00b6\u00b6** 15-16 (emphasis in original).\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, **\u00b6\u00b6** 20-22.\n\n75.\n\nClaimants note that both the *Azurix* and *EDF* committees, *i.e.,* the two committees to have considered the scenarios presently before this Committee, recognized the limits that the ICSID framework places on the exercise of a committee\u2019s powers under Article 52(1)(a), which is why *\"deference to the tribunal\u2019s decision-making remains an essential aspect of the governing legal standard.\"49*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, **\u00b6** 23.\n\n**3. Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n76.\n\nAs a preliminary remark, the Committee considers that Respondent is correct in emphasizing that the starting point of the Committee\u2019s analysis of its scope of review under this ground for annulment must be the text of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention, and not jurisprudence on this article as such. Respondent is further correct in pointing out that the text in Article 52(1)(a) does not contain any express qualifications or limitations as regards the scope of an *ad hoc* committee\u2019s review of whether the Tribunal was properly constituted. At the same time, the Committee notes, however, that the interpretation exercise does not stop at the wording of the article but extends to the context as well as the object and purpose reflecting the intention of the drafters and of the States that signed the Convention. This in turn has been examined by jurisprudence, and in the interest of consistency and predictability of ICSID jurisprudence, the Committee will take into account the interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) given by other committees. While the Committee is not bound by any of these decisions and, as noted above, has to perform its own interpretation exercise, it may refer to them for guidance.\n\n77.\n\nThe Parties agree that the term *\"properly constituted'* in Article 52(1)(a) is a reference to the requirements in Chapter IV, Section 2 of the ICSID Convention, which includes Article 40(2) referring to the qualities of an arbitrator set out in Article 14(1). Respondent further correctly pointed out that the English and Spanish texts of Article 14(1) are not identical: While the English text provides that arbitrators shall be persons who *\"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment,\"* the Spanish equivalent requires arbitrators to *\"inspirar plena confianza en su imparcialidad de juicio.\"* While the English version thus does not include an explicit reference to the requirement of impartiality, there is common ground that Article 14(1) in fact demands that arbitrators be both independent and impartial. In this regard, the Committee agrees with Respondent that the parties\u2019 confidence in the independence and impartiality of the arbitrators deciding their case is essential for ensuring the integrity of the proceedings and the dispute resolution mechanism as such; thus, in principle, a lack of the qualities in Article 14(1) may serve as ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(a). This conclusion is in line with the finding made by the *ad hoc* committee in *EDF v. Argentina* and also with the apparent intention of the drafters of the ICSID Convention.50\n\n**C/ AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 126, 128 and **A/CLA-70,** p. 852.\n\n78.\n\nAs to the applicable standard to be satisfied, the Committee further agrees with the **EDF**  committee that *\"Article 14(1) does not require proof of actual dependence or bias; it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias\"* However, as the **EDF**  committee noted, there is an objective test to be satisfied:\n\n\"... [T]he *standard to be applied under Article 14(1) is whether a reasonable thirdparty, with knowledge of all the facts, would consider that there were reasonable grounds for doubting that an arbitrator possessed the requisite qualities of independence and impartiality.\"51*\n\nThis Committee fully agrees with this finding of the *EDF* committee because to demand the *actual* proof of bias would establish an unrealistic burden on the party requesting annulment.\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6\u00b6** 109, 111.\n\n79.\n\nHowever, the Committee notes that there is an additional, important aspect to be taken into account in the present case: the fact that the remaining members of the Tribunal have already taken a decision on Respondent\u2019s allegation that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler manifestly lacked the qualities in Article 14(1) - in their Decision on Respondent\u2019s Second Disqualification Proposal dated 12 May 2008 pursuant to Articles 57, 58 of the ICSID Convention (the **\"Decision on Disqualification\").** There is common ground between the Parties that this decision must not be ignored by the Committee in its assessment of the annulment ground advanced by Respondent; however, the Parties are in dispute as to the specific impact it has on the scope of review of the Committee.\n\n80.\n\nRespondent relies on the leading commentary already quoted above, which provides as follows:\n\n*\"... Appointment of an arbitrator who manifestly does not possess these qualities* [in Article 14(1)] *may be put forward as a groundfor annulment*\n\n... [A] *party requesting annulment on the ground that the tribunal was not properly constituted will have to explain why it did not raise this objection during the arbitration proceedings. If it has done so unsuccessfully its right to invoke this ground for annulment remains unaffected...,\"52*\n\n**AL A RA 40,** Article 52, \u00b6\u00b6 123, 129.\n\n81.\n\nAccording to this authority, the right to request annulment based on an alleged lack of the qualities in Article 14(1) thus remains *\"unaffected'* by an unsuccessful challenge, and the standard of review appears to be the same as the one prescribed in Article 57, *i.e.,* limited to a *\"manifest\"* lack of the qualities described in Article 14(1).\n\n82.\n\nBefore turning to the existing case law on this issue, the Committee will perform its own interpretative exercise. At the outset, it has to be noted that, in this case Respondent acknowledged during the hearing that the existing decision of the co-arbitrators cannot be ignored in the Committee\u2019s assessment, but also argued that this decision cannot be binding in light of the Committee\u2019s function to safeguard the fundamental integrity of ICSID procedure.53 Consequently, it can be considered common ground that the Committee has to evaluate the decision rendered by the two co-arbitrators. The crucial question is, what is the applicable standard for this evaluation? While Respondent argues that Article 52(1)(a) empowers the Committee to fully review whether the Tribunal was properly constituted, Claimants take the position that the scope of the Committee\u2019s review is substantially reduced and refer to the approaches taken by the *Azurix* and *EDF* committees, which will be set out in detail below.\n\n*Cf.* Transcript (Day 2), p. 244 lines 3-10. *See* also Argentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6** 23.\n\n83.\n\nIn support of its position, Respondent argues that the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* of the ICSID Convention include a motion - which was not accepted - to delete the annulment ground under Article 52(1)(a) in order to avoid a *\"double attack on the same grounds.\"54* Contrary to Respondent\u2019s position, however, the fact that the drafters of ICSID Convention did not intend to exclude the possibility of requesting an annulment if a decision had already been taken in the underlying proceeding does not necessarily imply that they also intended a full review of the decision.55 In the Committee\u2019s view, such an interpretation of an *ad hoc* committee\u2019s scope of review cannot be assumed lightly given that a full review would be contrary to the principle in Article 53 that there is no appeal. Therefore and while being aware that Article 52(1)(a) does not include any qualifiers such as *\"manifest\", \"serious\"* or *\"fundamental\"* in the text as the grounds in Article 52(1)(b) and (d) do, the Committee does not consider that there is sufficient evidence to assume that the drafters of the ICSID Convention intended to confer broader powers on the *ad hoc* committee under Article 52(1)(a) than under the other grounds for annulment.\n\n**ALARA 106,** p. 853.\n\nIt is recorded in the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* that \"Mr. *BROCHES (Chairman) requested the sense of the meeting with respect to the proposal that (a) of Article 55(1)* [currently Article 52(1)] *be deleted entirely because the point would undoubtedly have been raised in the proceedings and there might be grounds for objecting to a double attack on the same grounds. A vote was then taken and the motion defeated by 18 to 2C* **AL A RA 106,** p. 853.\n\n84.\n\nThe Committee considers that the following aspects have to be taken into account when assessing the scope of review under Article 52(1)(a) in the context of an existing decision on a disqualification proposal: (i) the fact that the drafters included a review mechanism in Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention pursuant to which the decision on a disqualification proposal is to be taken by the remaining arbitrators or by the Chairman of the Administrative Council; (ii) the overarching principle of Article 53(1) that decisions made within the regime of the ICSID Convention shall not be subject to any appeal but only to an annulment proceeding *(i.e.,* a proceeding of limited scope, which is again governed by the ICSID Convention regime and does not include any involvement of national courts); and (iii) the existing jurisprudence on this issue, which this Committee should not ignore - not least in the legitimate aim of achieving a certain degree of consistency and legal certainty in ICSID jurisprudence.\n\n85.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee considers it more plausible that the intended scope for a review under Article 52(1)(a) was to be subject to the same limitations as the other annulment grounds, *i.e.,* a scope wide enough to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings but not so wide as to re-consider the merits of a decision that was already taken in the underlying proceedings based on the submissions and evidence presented by the Parties.\n\n86.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, Respondent\u2019s argument that the proper constitution of the Tribunal is not a merits issue, and thus a review of the Decision on Disqualification would not be a review *on the merits,* is not convincing. For the present purposes, the Committee does not need to express an opinion on whether a review of the issues resolved in the Decision on Disqualification is, or involves, a review of the merits. In any case, the same principle applies: a decision has been made on this issue in the underlying proceedings and in light of the context as well as the object and purpose of the annulment proceeding, it is not for this Committee to perform a *de novo* review of any issues decided in the underlying proceedings in accordance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention.\n\n87.\n\nHowever, this does not yet answer the question as to what is the actual role of this Committee in the present context, *i.e.,* what is the applicable standard to evaluate the Decision on Disqualification rendered by the two remaining members of the Tribunal.\n\n88.\n\nAt this point, the Committee will also consider existing case law on the particular question of how to deal with the present situation in which the allegations advanced by Respondent were already subject to a decision of the remaining members of the Tribunal in the arbitration proceedings. According to the Background Paper on Annulment for the ICSID Administrative Council (as updated in 2016) **(\"ICSID Background Paper on Annulment\"),** improper constitution of the tribunal under Article 52(1)(a) was raised in five cases, four of which actually decided on the annulment ground.56 In two cases, *i.e., Vivendi* *II* v. *Argentina* and *Transgabonais v. Gabon,* the issue was raised only after the award had already been rendered so that there was no prior decision of the co-arbitrators to be taken into account by the committee.57. In the two remaining cases, *i.e., Azurix v. Argentina* and *EDF v. Argentina,* the committees were faced with the same issue as this Committee, *i.e.,* an existing decision of the remaining two co-arbitrators on a disqualification proposal.58 Therefore, the Committee will take a closer look at these two decisions and the two different approaches taken by these committees.\n\n**A/CLA-91,** T(79. In *Sempra v. Argentina,* the tribunal did not decide on this annulment ground because it had already decided to annul the award in full based on another ground.\n\n**AL A RA 67,** 202; **A/CLA-83,** p. 13. In *Transgabonais,* the argument was raised for the first time at the hearing on annulment and therefore considered by the committee to be time-barred and inadmissible under Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**AL A RA 84 / A/CLA-69, \u00b6** 286; **AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 147.\n\n89.\n\nThe first decision was rendered in *Azurix v. Argentina.* In that case, the committee considered that *\"an* ad hoc *committee cannot decide for itself whether or not a decision under Article 58 was correct, as this would be tantamount to an appeal against such a decision. All that an* ad hoc *committee can consider is whether the provisions and procedures prescribed under Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 were complied with.* \"59 As for the merits, the *Azurix* committee thereby completely deferred to the decision of the remaining members of the tribunal.\n\n**AL A RA 84 / A/CLA-69, \u00b6** 282.\n\n90.\n\nIf the Committee were to follow the approach taken by the *Azurix* committee, its analysis would be a fairly short exercise given that neither Party in the present case has claimed that the Decision on Disqualification was made in violation of the procedure prescribed in Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention. In the Committee\u2019s view, however, this approach would not be consistent with the conclusion drawn in the interpretative exercise above and in particular with the purpose of annulment proceedings and thus the duty of an **ad hoc** committee to safeguard the integrity of the arbitration proceedings. The Committee rather agrees with the committee in *EDF v. Argentina* and rejects the *Azurix* approach as too narrow and formalistic because it prevents an **ad hoc** committee from playing any role in ensuring the independence and impartiality of the arbitrators - a matter *\"which goes to the very heart of the integrity of the arbitral procedure\"60*\n\n*Cf.* **AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6\u00b6** 140-141.\n\n91.\n\nThe second decision was rendered in *EDF v. Argentina,* where the committee took a broader approach than *Azurix* committee but also noted that it did not write on a blank sheet given that it was faced with an existing decision of the two co-arbitrators on this matter. The *EDF* committee therefore held that it may not find a ground for annulment *\"unless the decision not to disqualify the arbitrator in question is so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.\"61* As a result, the committee therefore also deferred, in principle, to the decision reached by the remaining members of the tribunal, subject however to an assessment whether such decision was *\"plainly unreasonable \"*\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 145.\n\n92.\n\nAs stated above, this Committee agrees with the **EDF** committee that it is for an *ad hoc* committee to safeguard the integrity of the arbitral proceedings, as Respondent has repeatedly emphasized. Having performed the interpretative exercise above, this Committee further agrees with the finding of the **EDF** committee that its approach is *\"commensurate with the principle that an* ad hoc *committee is not an appellate body.\"62* In particular, while being aware and thus agreeing with Respondent that the threshold applied by the *EDF* committee for annulling an award cannot be found in the wording of Article 52, the Committee has assessed above why a scope of review wide enough to safeguard the integrity of the proceedings but not so wide as to re-consider the merits of a decision that was already taken in the underlying proceedings is in line with the object and purpose of the annulment proceeding within the regime of the ICSID Convention and thus also in line with the interpretation principles of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 145.\n\n93.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, the reasons given by the **EDF** committee for its approach are convincing because they achieve a reasonable balance between an **ad hoc** committee\u2019s important task to safeguard the fundamental integrity of the proceedings on the one hand and the appropriate respect for its limited role, given the existence of proceedings under Articles 57 and 58 as well as the generally limited nature of annulment proceedings, on the other. The Committee considers that the threshold of plain unreasonableness leaves sufficient room for taking up the role that is intended for an **ad hoc** committee. Therefore, and also in the interest of achieving a certain consistency in ICSID jurisprudence on this issue, the Committee concurs with the findings of the **EDF** committee in its well-reasoned decision on the question of how to deal with an existing decision rendered by the remaining members of the tribunal in the underlying proceeding.\n\n94.\n\nIn conclusion and for the reasons set out above, the Committee agrees with the approach taken by the *EDF* committee and finds that the facts advanced by Respondent can amount to a ground for annulment only if the decision not to disqualify Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler was *\"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.\"*\n\n**B. Manifest Excess of Powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nRespondent submits that, as explained in the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment, the annulment ground of a manifest excess of powers was intended to apply in the situation where a decision of the tribunal *\"went beyond the terms of the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement\"63* According to Respondent, this is the case when either: (i) the tribunal lacks jurisdiction; or (ii) the tribunal fails to apply the applicable law. As regards the former, Respondent refers to the situation in which there is no consent to arbitration because the conditions to which such consent was made subject were not met; as regards the latter, Respondent quotes the ICSID Secretariat\u2019s statement that \"[w]here *the parties agree on applicable law, a disregard of this law would likely be equivalent to a derogation from the mandate conferred on the Tribunal by the parties.\"64*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 40 quoting from **AL A RA 7, \u00b6** 19.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, 41-43 quoting from **AL A RA 7, \u00b6** 93.\n\n96.\n\nRespondent agrees with Claimants that the term **\"manifest\"** is equal to *\"obvious\"* or *\"self-evident,\"* but rejects Claimants\u2019 additional reference to *\"substantialseriousness\"* as not being part of the **\"manifest\"** requirement. In this regard, Respondent refers to the finding of the **EDF** committee that *\"[t]he requirement that the excess of powers be* \u2018manifest\u2019 *refers to how readily apparent the excess is, rather than to its gravity\"65* At the same time, Respondent submits that this requirement *\"does not prevent that in some cases an extensive argumentation and analysis may be required to prove that such a manifest excess of powers has in fact occurred.\"66* Likewise, the **EDF** committee held that *\"[t]he reasoning in a case may be so complex that a degree of inquiry and analysis is required before it is clear precisely what the tribunal has decided. In such a case, the need for such inquiry and analysis will not prevent an excess ofpowers from being* \u2018manifest\u2019.\"67\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 25 quoting from **AL A RA 70, \u00b6** 192.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 28 quoting from **AL A RA 30,** 84. *See* also **AL A RA 90, \u00b6\u00b6** 57, 59.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 28 quoting from **AL A RA 70, \u00b6** 193.\n\n97.\n\nAs to the different categories where an excess of powers may be found, Respondent refers to the three parameters established by the *Soufraki* committee, *i.e.,* (i) the scope of the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction; (ii) the applicable law; and (iii) the issues raised by the parties. With regard to the first category, Respondent refers to the explanation given by the *Soufraki* committee that an excess of powers can involve the situation in which a tribunal goes beyond its jurisdiction *ratione personae, ratione materiae* or *ratione voluntatis* but also, *vice versa,* the situation in which the tribunal does not exercise its jurisdiction over a person, or a matter, or a question that does fall within the ambit of its jurisdiction.68\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, T[ 31 quoting from **AL A RA 61,** 42. *See* also **AL A RA 90,** 49-50 and **AL A RA 107,** 47-48.\n\n98.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that, contrary to Claimants\u2019 submission, it does recognize the *comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence* principle but asks this Committee to decide on the existence of a manifest excess of jurisdictional powers on the part of the Tribunal, in accordance with Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.69\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply. **\u00b6** 35.\n\n99.\n\nAs to the second category of excess of powers, Respondent refers to the committee\u2019s statement in *Enron v. Argentina* that the ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) *\"extends to the situation where a tribunal disregards the applicable law, or bases the award on a law other than the applicable law\".70* Respondent emphasizes that, contrary to Claimants\u2019 argument, it does not invoke an *\"erroneous application of the law,\"* but rather the failure to apply the law; in any event, an error of law can effectively be equivalent to a failure to apply the applicable law and thus also constitute a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(b).71\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6** 37 quoting from **AL A RA 33, \u00b6** 218.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6** 38.\n\n100.\n\nIn response to Claimants\u2019 submission that only a failure to apply the law *in toto* can justify an annulment, Respondent refers to the fact that the committee in *Sempra v. Argentina* found an excess of powers in respect of a failure to apply Article XI of the applicable BIT and thus annulled the award.72\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 40 quoting from **AL A RA 32, \u00b6\u00b6** 159, 165.\n\n101.\n\nAs to the third category of excess of powers, Respondent claims that it applies in the situation where a tribunal either decides on issues that the parties did not submit to it for resolution or fails to decide on issues that the parties did place before it.73\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 41.\n\n**2. Summary of Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nClaimants emphasize that under Articles 41 and 42 of the ICSID Convention, an ICSID tribunal is empowered to determine its own competence and to decide the dispute in accordance with the applicable law. According to Claimants, the requirement of a *\"manifest\"* excess of powers was included to safeguard the finality of awards and to limit the review of an annulment committee. Claimants further refer to the statement of the *Impregiio* committee that **\"manifest\"** means that *\"the excess of powers has to be obvious, self-evident, clear, flagrant and substantially serious.\"'74* While acknowledging that there is some debate as to whether the term **\"manifest\"** includes an inquiry into the gravity of the alleged excess of power, Claimants argue that in any event, *any* Article 52(1) ground requires a finding that the annullable error *\"actually had a material impact on the outcome of a case.\"75*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92 quoting from **A/CLA-42 / AL A RA 34, \u00b6** 128.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 46.\n\n103.\n\nClaimants submit that annulment committees repeatedly confirm that any excess of power must be obvious from a simple reading of the award in question and note that Argentina itself argued in the *Daimler* proceeding that an excess of powers cannot be *\"manifest\"* if it can be discerned only through *\"elaborate interpretation\"* of the tribunal\u2019s reasoning.76\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 93 quoting from **A/CLA-43, \u00b6** 158.\n\n104.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, an excess of powers may not involve the review of evidence before the tribunal because Rule 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules entrusts the assessment of the evidence to the tribunal - without any corresponding power being given to annulment committees under the ICSID Convention.77 Claimants argue that any suggestion to the contrary would be an invitation to conduct an appellate review and thus be inconsistent with the limited scope of annulment under the ICSID Convention.78\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 94.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 47.\n\n105.\n\nAs to the first category of excess of powers invoked by Respondent, Claimants submit that just like an alleged excess relating to the merits, an alleged excess of jurisdiction *\"must be obvious on its face and not susceptible to more than one interpretation\";* neither allegation can be subject to a *de novo* review. Claimants rely on the finding made by the committee in *SOS* v. *Paraguay* that *\"nothing in the ICSID Convention indicates that a different standard shall be applied to issues of jurisdiction, and therefore an award can only be annulled if the lack of excess ofjurisdiction is manifest\"79*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Memorial, 96-97; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 49 quoting from **A/CLA-46, \u00b6** 114.\n\n106.\n\nClaimants emphasize that pursuant to Articles 41(1) and 42(2) of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal\u2019s ruling on its own jurisdiction is conclusive and must stand where it has reached a reasonable decision. Claimants refer to the statement of the *Azurix* committee that *\"even if it is subsequently seen to be arguable whether or not the tribunal\u2019s decision under Article 41 was correct, it cannot be said that the tribunal manifestly lacked jurisdiction, and there is no basis for an* ad hoc *committee in purported exercise of its power under Article 52(1)(b) to substitute its own decision for that of the tribunal\"80*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, **\u00b6** 98 quoting from **A/CLA-69, \u00b6** 69.\n\n107.\n\nAs to the second category of excess of powers invoked by Respondent, Claimants submit that an erroneous application of the law is not a ground for annulment and refer to the finding of the **Impregiio** committee that *\"it is necessary to differentiate between a failure to apply the proper law and an error in applying the law. The first is a ground for annulment under Article 52, the second is not\"* The **Impregiio** committee further held that a review of whether the tribunal misapplied or misinterpreted the law would necessarily entail a review resulting in the committee acting as a court of appeal rather than an annulment committee.81\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 100 quoting from **A/CLA-42 / AL A RA 34, \u00b6** 131.\n\n108.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s reference to an alleged failure to apply specific provisions or rules of law, Claimants further rely on Prof. Schreuer who stated in his commentary that \"[p]artial *non-application and erroneous application are indistinguishable\" -* and neither qualifies as a ground for annulment.82 Claimants submit that a failure to apply the applicable law qualifies as an excess of power only if there has been a failure to apply the law *in toto,* by contrast, a tribunal\u2019s decision not to apply a particular legal provision does not constitute a failure to apply the applicable law but falls within the remit of the tribunal to determine the relevance of each provision of the chosen law.83\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 101 quoting from **A/CLA-97,** p. 964.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 102-103.\n\n109.\n\nWith regard to Respondent\u2019s reference to the positions taken by the *Soufraki* and *Sempra* committees, Claimants contend that these are outliers, which are not in line with the *\"extensive jurisprudence\"* rejecting the proposition that nothing less than a failure to apply the law *in toto* can justify an annulment. Claimants further note that the *Sempra* decision was criticized by commentators for conflating the concepts of legal error and manifest excess of powers.84\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 48.\n\n**3. Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n110.\n\nAs stated by the committee in *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates, \"[t]he notion of manifest excess of power implies that a tribunal has stepped entirely outside the scope of its authority.\"* The Committee further agrees with the *Soufraki* committee that *\"the structure within which an ICSID tribunal has to remain is defined by three elements: the imperative jurisdictional requirements, the rules on applicable law, and the issues submitted to the arbitral tribunal\"85*\n\n**ALARA 61, \u00b6** 37.\n\n111.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that the meaning of the term **\"manifest\"** is equal to *\"obvious\"* or *\"evident.\"* However, there is a dispute as to whether it is possible within that meaning that a certain amount of argumentation and/or analysis may be required to determine the existence of a **\"manifest\"** excess of powers. According to the leading commentary, which both Parties cite in different contexts and that was also cited with approval by the committee in *AES v. Hungary, \"[a]n excess of powers is manifest if it can be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis\"86* Claimants further refer to the committee\u2019s finding in *Wena Hotels v. Egypt* that *\"[t]he excess of power must be self-evident rather than the product of elaborate interpretations one way or the other. When the latter happens the excess of power is no longer manifest\"87*\n\n**AL A RA 40,** Article 52, \u00b6135; **A/CLA-35, \u00b6 31.**\n\n**A/CLA-30, \u00b6** 25.\n\n112.\n\nRespondent on the other hand refers to *Caratube v. Kazakhstan* where the committee held that it *\"agrees with Respondent that the term* \u2018manifest\u2019 *basically corresponds to* \u2018obvious\u2019 *or* \u2018evident\u2019. *However, this does not prevent that in some cases an extensive argumentation and analysis may be required to prove that such a manifest excess of powers has in fact occurred.\"88* A similar finding was made by the committee in *Occidental v. Ecuador.89* The *EDF* committee further held:\n\n*\" While the Committee agrees that an excess of powers will be manifest only if it can be readily discerned, it considers that this does not mean that the excess must, as it were, leap out of the page on the first reading of the Award. The reasoning in a case may be so complex that a degree of inquiry and analysis is required before it is clear precisely what the tribunal has* *decided. In such a case, the need for such inquiry and analysis will not prevent an excess of powers from being* \u2018manifest\u2019.\"90\n\n**AL A RA 30, \u00b6 84.**\n\n**AL A RA 90, \u00b6** 59.\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 193.\n\n113.\n\nThe Committee takes the view that the question of whether a certain degree of argumentation and/or analysis may be required in a specific case to determine whether a tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers cannot be answered in the abstract but only taking into account the circumstances of the individual case. To the extent it will become relevant, this question will therefore be discussed below in the Committee\u2019s analysis of whether Respondent has in fact established that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n114.\n\nHowever, as stated by the committee in *Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan,* such an analysis *\"should not require the Committee to reconsider the evidence put before the Tribunal. An ad hoc committee will not annul an award if the tribunal\u2019s approach is reasonable or tenable, even if the committee might have taken a different view on a debatable point of law.\"91* The committee in *Duke Energy v. Peru* noted that pursuant to Rule 34 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, *\"\u2018[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of the admissibility of any evidence adduced and of its probative value,\u2019\"* and held that \"[i]/ *would not be proper for an annulment committee to re-evaluate that evidence, and nor is it in a position to do so\"92*\n\n**A/CLA-32, \u00b6 96.**\n\n**A/CLA-31, \u00b6** 214 (quoting from **A/CLA-32, \u00b6 96).**\n\n115.\n\nThe Parties are further in dispute as to whether the term *\"manifest\"* also implies a certain gravity or result-determinativeness of the excess of powers. The committee in *SGS v. Paraguay* held that the excess of powers has to be *\"textually obvious and substantively serious.\"93* The committee in *El Paso v. Argentina* also found that *\"[p]ursuant to the plain meaning of the word* \u2018manifest\u2019 *in the context of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and considering the finality and binding nature of awards, features set forth in Article 53 of said Convention, for this Committee, the excess of powers should be obvious, evident, clear, self-evident and extremely serious\"94* A similar finding can be found in *Impregiio v. Argentina* where the committee stated that the excess of powers has to be, *inter alia, \"substantially serious\"95*\n\n**A/CLA-46, \u00b6** 122.\n\n**AL A RA 35, \u00b6** 142.\n\n**AL A RA 34, \u00b6** 128.\n\n116.\n\nAs implied by the terms *\"substantively serious\"* and *\"extremely serious,\"* the Committee considers that for an excess of powers to be *\"manifest,\"* it has to have had a certain significance for the decision or award that was rendered. This is in line with the committee\u2019s finding in *Libananco v. Turkey* that *\"annulment should not occur unless a tribunal has exceeded its power in a clear manner and with serious consequences\"96* In the context of an excess through a non-exercise of power, the committee in *AES v. Hungary* also held that the term *\"manifest\"* implies that the non-exercise was *\"somehow significant or consequential.\"* In that case, the parties agreed that the non-exercise had to be *\"result-determinative,\"97*\n\n**A/CLA-95, \u00b6** 102.\n\n**A/CLA-35, \u00b6** 30.\n\n117.\n\nFinally, Respondent has advanced the argument that an excess of powers in the context of jurisdiction always qualifies as *\"manifest\"* and thus is an annulment ground under Article 52(1)(b). However, the Committee agrees with Claimant that there is no indication in either the text of Article 52(1)(b), its context or in the object and purpose of the annulment proceeding within the regime of the ICSID Convention that would support the position that the standard of review to be applied to jurisdiction decisions is different from that applied to merits decisions. To the contrary, Article 41 of the ICSID Convention provides that *\"[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence\"* and Respondent acknowledges that this provision reflects the *comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence* principle. As stated by the committee in *SGS v. Paraguay,* it follows from Article 41 that \"[a tribunal\u2019s] *decision on the scope of its jurisdiction cannot be reviewed* de novo *by an Annulment Committee\"* and that in the absence of any indication to the contrary, *\"an award can only be annulled if the lack or excess of jurisdiction was manifest\"98* Similar findings were made by the committees in *Azurix v. Argentina99* and *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates.100*\n\n**A/CLA-46, \u00b6** 114.\n\n**AL A RA 84 / A/CLA-69,** \u00b666 **,** \u00b669 **.**\n\n**AL A RA 61, \u00b6\u00b6 118-119.** *See* also *Occidental v. Ecuador* where the parties agreed that *\"this important limitation* [of the term \u2018manifest\u2019] *applies both to a jurisdictional excess ofpowers and to a failure to apply the proper law. This conclusion, shared by this Committee, has been confirmed by previous committees.\"* **AL A RA 90,** \u00b658 **.**\n\n118.\n\nIn line with previous jurisprudence, the Committee therefore finds that the standard of review is the same for all three elements that define the boundaries of the Tribunal\u2019s power under the ICSID Convention: an excess of powers can amount to a ground for annulment only if it qualifies as *\"manifest,\"* which means that such excess of powers has to be obvious, evident and substantially serious.\n\n**C. Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n119.\n\nRespondent submits that this ground for annulment is designed to *\"safeguard the substantive fairness and integrity of the arbitral process\"* and is not limited to the rules provided for in the ICSID Arbitration Rules but rather refers to *\"a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law.\"101* According to Respondent, these standards include, *inter alia, \"the right to be heard and to be given a suitable opportunity for rebuttal, the guarantee of due process of law, the right of defence, the principle of equality between the parties, deliberation among the members of the tribunal, the independence and impartiality of the members of the tribunal and the consideration of evidence and the burden ofproof.\"102* Respondent further refers to *\"an arbitrators\u2019 duty of investigation, disclosure and notification in the treatment and management of existing or potential conflicts of interest\"103*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 51-52; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 43 quoting from **AL A RA 63, \u00b6** 57.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 53.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 44 citing **AL A RA 67, \u00b6** 204.\n\n120.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the right to be heard by an independent and impartial tribunal, Respondent claims that a violation of this right amounts to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and refers to the committee in *Klockner I,* which stated that *\"[i]mpartiality of an arbitrator is a fundamental and essential requirement. Any shortcoming in this regard, that is any sign of partiality, must be considered to constitute, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d), a* \u2018serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\u2019 *in the broad sense of the term* \u2018procedure,\u2019 *i.e., a serious departure from a fundamental rule of arbitration in general, and of ICSID arbitration in particular.\"104*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, **\u00b6** 54 quoting from **AL A RA 56, \u00b6** 95 (albeit without explicit reference).\n\n121.\n\nRespondent further contends that, contrary to Claimants\u2019 submission, nothing in Article 52(1)(d) provides for a limitation of the powers of an *ad hoc* committee to verifying the existence of any *\"procedural irregularity\" -* rather than an analysis whether an arbitrator manifestly lacked the requirements in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Respondent emphasizes that the *EDF* committee recognized that *\"the fact that there is reasonable doubt about whether an arbitrator possessed the qualities of independence and impartiality*  *required by Article 14(1) is a ground on which an award might be annulled under Article 52(1)(d).\"105*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6** 48-50 quoting from **AL A RA 70, \u00b6** 125.\n\n122.\n\nWith regard to the limitation imposed by the *EDF* Committee on its review under Article 52(1)(a), Respondent reiterates that this limitation has no basis in the ICSID convention and claims that, in any event, it should not restrict an annulment committee\u2019s power to verify a serious departure from other fundamental rules of procedure, such as an arbitrator\u2019s duties relating to the investigation, disclosure and notification of conflicts of interest.106\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6\u00b6** 51-53.\n\n123.\n\nFinally, Respondent rejects Claimants\u2019 submission that the term *\"serious\"* implies that the procedural irregularity must have caused the tribunal to reach a *\"substantially different\"* result and refers to the committee in *Pey Casado v. Chile,* which held that *\"the applicant must demonstrate* \u2018the impact the issue may have had on the award\u2019.\"107 Respondent also cites the decision in *Tulip v. Turkey,* which found that *\"the applicant must demonstrate that the observance of the rule had the* potential *of causing the tribunal to render an award substantially different from what it actually decided\"108*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46 quoting from **AL A RA 65, \u00b6** 78.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 45, 47 quoting from **A/CLA-90, \u00b6** 78 (emphasis in original).\n\n**2. Summary of Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nClaimants submit that the requirement *\"fundamentar* requires that the violated rule relates to an element of due process and agrees with Respondent that this includes *\"the equal treatment of parties, the right to be heard, the right to respond, or the right to an independent and impartial tribunal\"* Claimants further contend that the requirement *\"serious\"* requires that the procedural irregularity caused the tribunal to reach a result *\"substantially different\"* from the result it would have reached in the absence of said irregularity.109\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 61, 140.\n\n125.\n\nInsofar as Respondent invokes this annulment ground as a second basis in the context of the challenge to Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, Claimants note that Respondent does not invoke any procedural irregularity in the procedure for hearing and deciding an arbitrator challenge, but rather argues on the erroneous basis that this Committee is empowered to perform a *de novo* review of the challenge and the question of whether Prof. Kaufmann Kohler manifestly lacked the qualities in Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.110\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 64, 143.\n\n126.\n\nClaimants further point out that the standard established by the *EDF* committee was applied to both Articles 52(1)(a) and (d) - in line with *\"settled law that annulment can never be a vehicle for unfettered review of the merits of a Tribunal\u2019s decision\"111*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, **\u00b6** 41.\n\n127.\n\nIn respect of Respondent\u2019s reliance on an arbitrator\u2019s duty to investigate and disclose conflicts, Claimants emphasize that the *Vivendi II* committee referred to by Respondent was not faced with an existing decision on an arbitrator challenge and did no more than to recognize that there is a duty to disclose conflicts of interests. Claimants argue, however, that this duty is not in itself a fundamental rule of procedure but rather a reflection of the requirement that arbitrators must be independent and impartial; consequently, nondisclosure cannot be a ground for disqualification where the non-disclosed facts do not result in a conflict of interest.112\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 42.\n\n**3. Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n128.\n\nThe Parties agree that the annulment ground in Article 52(1)(d) is intended to ensure that a set of minimal standards of procedure is observed in the arbitral proceedings. As stated by the committee in *Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* this set of standards is *\"to be respected as a matter of international law\"* and includes that *\"each party is given the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal,\"* which in turn includes *\"the right to state its claim or its defense and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it.\"113*\n\n**AL A RA 63 / A/CLA-30, \u00b6** 57.\n\n129.\n\nAs pointed out by Claimants, the **Wena Hotels** committee further held that *\"[i]n order to be a* \u2018serious\u2019 *departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed\"114* However, as noted with approval by the committee in *Victor Pey Casado v. Chile,* the **Wena Hotels** committee denied a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure because the applicant had failed to demonstrate *\"the impact that the issue* may *have had on the award.\"115*\n\n**AL A RA 63 / A/CLA-30, \u00b6** 58.\n\n**AL A RA 65, \u00b6** 78 quoting from **AL A RA 63 / A/CLA-30, \u00b6 61.**\n\n130.\n\nThe same standard was applied by the committee in *Caratube v. Kazakhstan,* which held that:\n\n*\"A departure is serious if the violation of the fundamental rule of procedure produced a material impact on the award. The applicant however is not required to prove that the violation of the rule of procedure was decisive for the outcome, or that the applicant would have won the case if the rule had been applied. As the* Wena *committee stated, what the applicant must simply demonstrate is* \u2018the impact that the issue may have had on the Award\u2019.\"116\n\n**AL A RA 30 \u00b699.**\n\n131.\n\nThis Committee agrees that the *Caratube* approach is reasonable because, as stated by the committee in *Tulip v. Turkey,* \"[t]o *require an applicant to prove that the award would actually have been different, had the rule of procedure been observed, may impose an unrealistically high burden of proof.\"117*\n\n**A/CLA-90478.**\n\n132.\n\nFinally and specifically with regard to the question of whether the alleged lack of the qualities of independence and impartiality of an arbitrator as required by Article 14(1) can give rise to a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d), the Committee agrees with the convincing reasons given by the *EDF* committee in this regard:\n\n\"[I]*t is important to recall that it is only an award which can be the subject of annulment and not any previous decision of a tribunal.... There can, therefore, be no question of an* ad hoc *committee annulling the decision taken by the remaining members of a tribunal under Article 58 to reject a proposal for disqualification. The only way in which that decision can be called into question in annulment proceedings is if it is considered to taint the award which is subsequently adopted. Any consideration of the role of Article 52(1)(d) must take that into account. If an award may be tainted by the fact that a decision whether or not to disqualify an arbitrator was taken in a manner which was procedurally deficient,* a fortiori *an award may be tainted by the fact that the award itself was adopted by a tribunal one or more of whose members did not meet the requisite standard of impartiality and independence.\"118*\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6 124.**\n\n133.\n\nHowever, the Committee notes that the considerations expressed above in the context of the scope of review under Article 52(1)(a) apply also in connection with the review of whether there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. In particular, the Committee recalls that it is faced with an existing decision rendered by the remaining members of the Tribunal and that it is not for this Committee to perform a *de novo* review of the factual and legal questions that have already been assessed in this decision. For the same reasons that have been detailed above, the Committee therefore again agrees with the *EDF* committee that *\"it may not find a ground of annulment exists under either Article 52(1)(a) or 52(1)(d) unless the decision not to disqualify the arbitrator in question is so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision\"119*\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 145.\n\n**D. Failure to State Reasons in the Award (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention)**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nRespondent notes that, unlike other grounds for annulment, the ground *\"failure to state reasons\"* is not qualified by a phrase such as *\"manifestly\"* or *\"serious\"* and argues that this results from the fact that the requirement to provide reasons is *\"an essential aspect of ICSID arbitration.\"* Respondent points out that a proposal to include in the ICSID Convention an option for the parties to waive the statement of reasons in the award was rejected and refers to Aron Broches, then chairman of a regional meeting of experts, who opined that this decision *\"underscores the importance attached by the drafters to the statement of reasons, and is a factor which may be taken into account by* ad hoc *committees\"120*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 45-47 quoting from **AL A RA 55, p. 331.**\n\n135.\n\nRespondent refers to the four forms of a failure to state reasons established by the *Soufraki* committee: (i) *\"a total absence of reasons for the award, including the giving of mere frivolous reasons\"',* (ii) *\"a total failure to state reasons for a particular point, which is material for the solution\"',* (iii) *\"contradictory reasons\"',* and (iv) *\"insufficient or inadequate reasons, which are insufficient to bring about the solution or inadequate to explain the result arrived at by the tribunal.\"121* Respondent further refers to the annulment committee in *Pey Casado v. Chile,* which held that *\"as long as there is no express rationale for the conclusions with respect to a pivotal or outcome-determinative point, an annulment must follow, whether the lack of rationale is due to a complete absence of reasons or the result of frivolous or contradictory explanations\"122*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 48; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 55 quoting from **AL A RA 61, \u00b6** 126.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 55 quoting from **AL A RA 65, \u00b6** 86.\n\n136.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, there should be no speculation about any potential reasons that might justify the conclusion reached by the tribunal, but the factors leading to the decision must be expressed *\"with a minimum of coherence and consistency (regardless of whether they are* *correct or not)\"*123 Respondent refers to the annulment committee *mMINE v. Guinea,* which stated that one must be able to *\"follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion\"124*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 49.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 54 quoting from **AL A RA 62, \u00b6** 5.09.\n\n137.\n\nIn response to Claimants\u2019 argument that contradictory reasons are often better dealt with under the remedies of rectification or interpretation of awards rather than in annulment proceedings, Respondent takes the view that such remedies are not suitable to verify the tribunal\u2019s duty to state non-contradictory reasons, given that the scope of rectification under Article 49(2) is limited to *\"rectify[ing] clerical, arithmetical or similar error\"* and the scope of interpretation under Article 50 does not extend beyond clarifying *\"the meaning or scope of an award\"* Respondent further refers to the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment, which records that *\"a majority of* ad hoc *Committees have concluded that* \u2018frivolous\u2019 *and* \u2018contradictory\u2019 *reasons are equivalent to no reasons and could justify an annulment.\"125*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 56-58 quoting from **A/CLA-91, \u00b6** 107.\n\n138.\n\nSpecifically in relation to the rectification remedy, Respondent refers to Prof. Schreuer who states in his commentary that *\"the procedure of self-correction under Art. 49(2) will be useful only in the case of inadvertent omissions of a technical character but not in the case of a considered omission affecting a fundamental aspect of the tribunal\u2019s reasoning.... The grounds for annulment of failure to state reasons (Art. 52(1)(e)), departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Art. 52(1)(d)) and manifest excess of powers (Art. 52(1)(b)) may be available in case of a failure to decide an essential question.\"126* Respondent submits that in line with this commentary, annulment committees have found that a tribunal\u2019s failure to address a question submitted to it (contrary to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention), *\"which may affect the final decision of that tribunal,\"* may amount to any of the three above mentioned annulment grounds.127\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6** 59 quoting from **AL A RA 92,** p. 864.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6** 40 citing **A/CLA-91, \u00b6** 104.\n\n139.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the failure to address certain evidence in the damages phase, Respondent quotes from the finding of the annulment committee in *TECO v. Guatemala* that \"[w]*hile the Committee accepts that a tribunal cannot be required to address within its award each and every piece of evidence in the record, that cannot be construed to mean that a tribunal can simply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, without any analysis and without explaining why it found that evidence* *insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory. A tribunal is duty bound to the parties to at least address those pieces of evidence that the parties deem to be highly relevant to their case and, if it finds them to be of no assistance, to set out the reasons for this conclusion.\"128*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6** 61 quoting from **AL A RA 89, \u00b6** 131.\n\n140.\n\nRespondent points out that the *TECO* committee considered it relevant that the tribunal had failed to address expert reports directly pertaining to the loss of value claim and thus *\"failed to observe evidence which at least had the potential to be relevant to the final outcome of the case\"-,* it thus partially annulled the award, stating that the tribunal\u2019s failure to address these expert reports *\"despite the parties\u2019 strong emphasis on expert evidence\"* rendered the tribunal\u2019s reasoning *\"difficult to understand\u2019* and, in the eyes of the committee, not satisfactory under the reasoning requirements of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.129\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6** 62 quoting from **AL A RA 89, \u00b6\u00b6** 135, 138.\n\n141.\n\nIn relation to Claimants\u2019 argument that the Committee should *\"actively seek to get inside the skin of the tribunal,\"* Respondent takes the view that this would be *\"well beyond the scope\"* of the Committee\u2019s powers and, in fact contrary *\"to the very essence\"* of the ground for annulment in Article 52(1)(e). Respondent refers to the finding of the *Klockner I* committee that *\"it is not for the Committee to imagine what might or should have been the arbitrators\u2019 reasons, anymore than it should substitute* \u2018correct\u2019 *reasons for possible* \u2018incorrect\u2019 *reasons, or deal* \u2018ex post facto\u2019 *with questions submitted to the Tribunal which the Award left unanswered.\u2019\u2019130*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 63-64 quoting from **AL A RA 56, \u00b6** 151.\n\n**2. Summary of Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n142.\n\nClaimants emphasize that, while *\"in highly limited circumstances,\"* a violation of the duty to provide a reasoned award under Article 48(3) may amount to a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, an *ad hoc* committee is not authorized to review the quality or persuasiveness of a tribunal\u2019s reasoning. Claimants quote from the ICSID Background Paper of Annulment stating that *\"[t]he correctness of the reasoning or whether it is convincing is not relevant\u2019* to a committee\u2019s inquiry.131\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 146-147 quoting from **A/CLA-91, \u00b6** 105.\n\n143.\n\nClaimants take the view that, despite recognizing that a failure to state reasons requires a total absence of reasons, genuinely contradictory reasons (which result in an effective absence of reasons) or reasons *\"so lacking in coherence that a reader cannot follow\"* them, Respondent does not allege that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning in the Award is unintelligible or absent of reasons but rather attacks the quality of the reasoning. Claimants submit that as long as it is possible to follow the reasoning through to the tribunal\u2019s conclusion, there can be no annulment, and refer to the finding of the *Vivendi I* committee that *\"Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state* any *reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons. It bears reiterating that an* ad hoc *committee is not a court of appeal. Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issue that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e).\"132*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, 148-149 quoting from **AL A RA 57, \u00b6** 64 (emphasis in original); Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, **\u00b6** 87.\n\n144.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s argument that an *ad hoc* committee may not fill any gaps in the tribunal\u2019s reasoning, Claimants contend, apart from claiming that there are no such gaps in the present case, that a tribunal\u2019s reasons *\"may be implicit so long as they are understandable*.\" Claimants argue that the committee should assess whether such reasons are implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award and refer to Prof. Reisman\u2019s statement that annulment committees must *\"actively seek to get inside the skin of the tribunal whose award is under review and to track its explicit and implicit ratiocination before concluding that its reasoning is insufficient.* \"133 In this context, Claimants refer to the committee in *TECO v. Guatemala,* which stated that *\"not all of a tribunal\u2019s reasons need to be set out explicitly, as long as they can be understood from the rest of the award\"134*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, 151-152 quoting from **A/CLA-110,** p. 795.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 93 quoting from **AL A RA 89, \u00b6** 88.\n\n145.\n\nClaimants further submit that a failure to state reasons must relate to an essential point in the tribunal\u2019s decision and claim that where a tribunal fails to address a discrete question not relevant to the final decision, the appropriate remedy would be a request for supplementary decision under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention. While acknowledging that contradictory reasons *\"may exceptionally constitute a failure to state reasons where they prevent the reader from understanding the tribunal\u2019s motives,\"* Claimants take the position that in many cases, contradictions *\"are more appropriately dealt with\"* under the remedies of rectification and interpretation of awards provided in Articles 49(2) and 50 of the ICSID Convention rather than in annulment proceedings.135 Claimants reject Respondent\u2019s argument that these remedies are insufficient to address allegedly contradictory reasoning and refer to the *Impregiio* committee, which confirmed that Articles 49 and 50 provide the parties with an opportunity to address *\"omissions, rectify material errors, and clarify the interpretation of an award\"136*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 153-154.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 89 quoting from **A/CLA-42 / AL A RA 34, \u00b6214.**\n\n146.\n\nIn addition, Claimants quote from the ICSID Background Paper of Annulment, which states that \"[w]hile *a Tribunal must deal with every question submitted to it, the drafting history indicates that a failure to do so should not result in annulment. Instead, the ICSID Convention provides another remedy where a Tribunal fails to address a question: the dissatisfied party may request that the same Tribunal issue a supplementary decision concerning the question not addressed. In addition, if there is a dispute between the parties as to the meaning or scope of the award, either party may request interpretation of the award by the original Tribunal.\"137*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 91 quoting from **A/CLA-91, \u00b6** 103.\n\n147.\n\nIn this context, Claimants refer to the *Daimler* committee, which held that \"[t]iro *tests must be satisfied before an* ad hoc *committee can annul an award based on contradictory reasons. First, the reasons must be genuinely contradictory in that they cancel each other out so as to amount to no reasons at all. Second, the point with regard to which these reasons are given is necessary for the tribunal\u2019s decision.\"138*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 155 quoting from **A/CLA-43, 77.**\n\n148.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s reliance on the findings of the **TECO** committee leading to a partial annulment of the award, Claimants note that this committee was faced with a complete failure of the tribunal to consider any evidence on an issue central to its decision. In Claimants\u2019 view, nothing in this decision suggests that the **TECO** committee considered annulment appropriate anytime a tribunal failed to address evidence on a particular point, which it in fact explicitly denied in line with settled case law.139\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 92 referring to **AL A RA 89, \u00b6\u00b6** 130-138.\n\n149.\n\nFinally, Claimants argue that tribunals should be afforded a certain degree of discretion over the manner in which they express their reasoning, which may differ depending on the legal tradition, and conclude that *\"[c]ommittees should therefore favor an interpretation of the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning that confirms the consistency of its decision, rather than engage in a hunt for contradictions.\"140*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 156.\n\n**3. Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n150.\n\nRespondent submits that a failure to state reasons exists in the four cases identified by the committee in *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates',* (i) *\"a total absence of reasons for the award, including the giving of merely frivolous reasons\"',* (ii) *\"a total failure to state reasons for a particular point, which is material for the solution\"',* (iii) *\"contradictory reasons\"',* and (iv) *\"insufficient or inadequate reasons, which are insufficient to bring about the solution or inadequate to explain the result arrived at by the Tribunal\"141*\n\n**ALARA 61** \u00b6 126.\n\n151.\n\nClaimants agree that a failure to state reasons arises: (i) *\"where there has been a total absence of reasons\"',* (ii) *\"where a tribunal\u2019s reasoning is genuinely contradictory\"',* and (iii) *\"where the reasoning is so lacking in coherence that a reader cannot follow it\"142*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 148.\n\n152.\n\nWhile emphasizing that this ground for annulment is not qualified by a term such as *\"manifest\"* or *\"serious,\"* Respondent apparently accepts that a failure to state reasons must relate to a *\"material\"* or, as put by the committee in *Pey Casado v. Chile* that Respondent quotes in this regard, to a *\"pivotal or outcome-determinative point\"143* Claimants, for their part, do not explicitly dispute that a failure to state reasons may relate to only part of the award but rather emphasize that such failure must result in the inability to follow the tribunal\u2019s reasons through to its conclusion. In the Committee\u2019s view, this is not in contradiction with the statement of the *Pey Casado* committee that *\"d\u00e8s lors qu \u2019il n \u2019existe aucun fondement expr\u00e8s pour \u00e9tayer les conclusions sur un point crucial ou d\u00e9terminant pour le r\u00e9sultat, l\u2019annulation doit \u00eatre prononc\u00e9e...*,\"144 If there were no express rationale with respect to a pivotal or outcome-determinative point of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, its reasons could not be followed through to its conclusion. Such finding could warrant annulment of the Award.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 55 quoting from **AL A RA 65, \u00b6\u00b6** 86.\n\n**AL A RA 65, \u00b6** 86.\n\n153.\n\nIt further appears that Respondent does not dispute the statement of the committee in *Vivendi v. Argentina I* that *\"it is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state* any *reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct and convincing reasons\"145* In line with the *Vivendi I* committee\u2019s further finding that there can be no annulment under Article 52(1)(e) if the reasons given by the tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues before it, the committee *in MINE v. Guinea* that Respondent quotes in this context held that *\"the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error offact or of law\"146*\n\n**AL A RA 57, \u00b6** 64.\n\n**ALARA 62 \u00b6** 5.09.\n\n154.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee considers it common ground that the issue before this Committee is not to assess the accuracy or quality of the reasons given by the Tribunal but rather to review whether these reasons enable the reader to understand why the Tribunal reached the conclusions that were determinative for its decision(s).\n\n155.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties primarily focuses on: (i) the role in this context of the remedies of rectification and interpretation of the award under Articles 49(2) and 50 of the ICSID Convention; and (ii) the efforts an *ad hoc* committee should undertake to extract the reasons given by the tribunal from the decision it has rendered and to follow those reasons through to the tribunal\u2019s conclusion before finding that a ground for annulment exists.\n\n156.\n\nAs to the first issue, the Committee agrees with Claimants that to the extent it would have been open to Respondent to correct any alleged flaw in the Award by means of an application for rectification or interpretation under Articles 49(2) or 50, such flaw does not qualify as a ground for annulment. At the same time, however, the Committee notes that the scope of the rectification remedy is expressly limited to *\"clerical, arithmetical or similar error,\" i.e.,* errors that would not justify an annulment in any event. The interpretation remedy is meant to clarify disputes as to *\"the meaning or scope of an award'* but it does not apply in case the meaning and scope of the decision are clear but not supported by reasons that enable the reader to understand how the tribunal reached the underlying conclusions.\n\n157.\n\nAs for the second issue, the Committee is aware that Claimants cite the statement of a leading authority that annulment committees must *\"actively seek to get inside the skin of the tribunal whose award is under review and to track its explicit and implicit ratiocination before concluding that its reasoning is insufficient.\"147* Respondent on the other hand refers to the committee in *Klockner v. Cameroon I,* which held that *\"it is not for the Committee to imagine what might or should have been the arbitrators\u2019 reasons, any more than it should substitute* \u2018correct\u2019 *reasons for possibly* \u2018incorrect\u2019 *reasons, or deal* \u2018ex post facto\u2019 *with questions submitted to the Tribunal which the Award left unanswered.\"148*\n\n**A/CLA-110,** p. 795.\n\n**ALARA 564 \u00b6** 151.\n\n158.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, these statements do not necessarily contradict each other but they rather reflect the difficulty of finding a reasonable and balanced standard of review. While an **ad hoc** committee certainly may not speculate on possible reasons or even replace given reasons by reasons of its own making, it must be borne in mind that an annulment proceeding is meant to safeguard the fundamental integrity of the arbitration proceedings but not to be mistaken for a detailed scrutiny of whether each and every conclusion is supported by fully comprehensible reasons. Consequently, the Committee considers that it can be expected from an **ad hoc** committee to undertake reasonable efforts to follow the reasons given by the tribunal, the extent of which cannot be answered in the abstract but must be determined in the individual circumstances of the case.\n\n159.\n\nFinally and specifically with regard to Respondent\u2019s allegation that the Tribunal has failed to give reasons addressing certain evidence relevant to Respondent\u2019s necessity defense, the Committee generally agrees with the *El Paso* committee that *\"[t]he assessment of the evidence and interpretation of the applicable law must be performed only by the Tribunal, not by the Committee\"* and that an *ad hoc* committee *\"cannot or should not decide whether evidence was well or ill-considered or not considered at all by the Tribunal.\"149*\n\n**ALARA 35, \u00b6\u00b6** 191, 196.\n\n160.\n\nThe Committee further agrees with the finding of the **EDF** committee that \"[s]o *long as the reader can follow the reasoning in the Award, the fact that it does not deal with each authority or every item of evidence is immaterial.\"* Albeit in the context of Article 52(1)(d), the **EDF** committee then held that the tribunal is not required *\"to discuss any particular item of evidence in detail, or at all, where it is not necessary to do so in order to decide the questions before it.\"150*\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6\u00b6** 349, 350.\n\n161.\n\nThe Committee is aware that Respondent places particular reliance on a finding made by the committee in *TECO v. Guatemala* that \"[w]/zz7e *the Committee accepts that a tribunal cannot be required to address within its award each and every piece of evidence in the record, that cannot be construed to mean that a tribunal can simply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, without any analysis and without explaining why it found that evidence insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory. A tribunal is duty bound to the parties to at least address those pieces of evidence that the parties deem* *to be highly relevant to their case and, if it finds them to be of no assistance, to set out the reasons for this conclusion.\"151*\n\n**ALARA 894 \u00b6** 131.\n\n162.\n\nHowever, as the *TECO* committee clarified immediately before the passage quoted by Respondent, \"[i]/ *was within the Tribunal\u2019s discretion to assess whether* [the expert] *testimony was relevant or not, material or not, and that view is not censorable on annulment. However, that is not what is at stake here. The Committee takes issue with the complete absence of any discussion of the Parties\u2019 expert reports within the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the loss of value claim\"152* Consequently, this decision cannot be deemed to allow for a re-evaluation of the evidence put before the tribunal but it rather concerned the exceptional case in which a total failure to address *\"highly relevant\"* evidence amounted to a failure to state reasons under Article 52(l)(e) and justified a partial annulment of the award.\n\n**ALARA 894 \u00b6** 131.\n\n163.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee therefore maintains the view that as held by previous ICSID jurisprudence, it is not for this Committee to re-consider the evidence put before the Tribunal. Annulment for a failure to state reasons could be warranted only if there was a total failure to address evidence that would have been *\"highly relevant\"* to the Tribunal\u2019s decision, *i.e.,* evidence whose consideration could have had a significant impact on the Award.\n\n**VI. THE COMMITTEE\u2019S VIEWS**\n-----------------------------\n\n164.\n\nRespondent has invoked four sets of grounds that, in its view, fulfill different grounds for annulment under Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention. In order to thoroughly address each set of grounds, the Committee will follow the same structure that Respondent applied in its written pleadings and assess the individual grounds of annulment advanced by Respondent.\n\n**A. First Set of Grounds for Annulment Relating to the Appointment of Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler as Director of UBS and Her Alleged Failure to Inform and Investigate**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nRespondent submits that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s appointment in April 2006 as a member of the Board of Directors of UBS AG, which in turn held shares and other interests in two of the Claimants, *i.e.,* Suez and Vivendi, created a *\"serious conflict of interest,\"* which made it *\"manifestly impossible\"* for her to be relied upon to exercise independent judgment as required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Respondent further claims that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler breached the *\"fundamental duty to disclose that situation in the arbitrations in which she was involved and to properly investigate the connections between UBS and the parties to those proceedings\"* According to Respondent, from the moment of Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s appointment to the Board of Directors, the Tribunal was therefore no longer properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention) and there was a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).153\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6\u00b6 23, 33; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59, 98; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 67, 98.\n\n166.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that, while Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler did provide UBS with a list of her ongoing arbitrations, she did not ask UBS to identify any relationship it had with any of the parties to those arbitrations, nor did she make any independent inquiries of her own in this regard. Respondent refers to the expert report of Prof. Wolfram, who identified both a *\"loyalty\"* interest and an *\"economic\"* self-interest in Claimants\u2019 favor that each generated a conflict of interest, given that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler had a responsibility to support UB S\u2019 s business interests and was financially tied to UBS\u2019s financial success, which was in turn connected to Claimants\u2019 success in this arbitration.154\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 65, 70; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 81 referring to **Exhibit A RA 66, \u00b6\u00b6** 11-15.\n\n167.\n\nAs to the interest of loyalty, Respondent again refers to Prof. Wolfram\u2019s report, which pointed out two relevant forms of interest: (i) UBS held stock in Suez and Vivendi on its own account and as wealth-management custodian for its bank clients; and (ii) UBS had publicly recommended to its clients to invest in Claimants\u2019 business sector or specifically in their stock. As to the economic self-interest, Respondent notes that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler received at least 50% and up to 100% of her compensation in UBS stock.155\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 80, 82 referring to **Exhibit A RA 66, \u00b6\u00b6** 8, 15.\n\n168.\n\nRespondent submits that, in its Decision on Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal for Disqualification, the Tribunal failed to address Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s *\"fiduciary duty to protect the economic interests of UBS in the Claimants, her natural inclination to do so, her institutional loyalty to advance such interests, or the justifiable doubts this created regarding her ability to act as an impartial arbitrator\"* In addition, Respondent takes the view that the Tribunal downplayed the value of UBS\u2019s investments in Suez and Vivendi, valued at over USD 2 billion, and incorrectly stated that UBS\u2019s shareholdings in Claimants *\"in no way affect the compensation that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler earns as a director of UBS\"156*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 75, 76 quoting from Decision on Disqualification, \u00b6 40.\n\n169.\n\nAs to the four criteria examined by the Tribunal members to evaluate the connection between Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler and Claimants, *i.e.,* proximity, intensity, dependence, and materiality, Respondent notes that they are not based on any authority and in any event, the Tribunal erroneously assessed the facts against them and in addition referred to links between strangers around the world and even aliens - as a result of which the Decision on Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal for Disqualification was *\"completely lacking in reasonableness\"157* In addition to the facts known to Respondent when it filed its Second Proposal for Disqualification, Respondent submits that it learned in May 2008 that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler had become even more influential at UBS because she had been appointed as chair of the UBS\u2019s Nominating Committee, which is in charge of proposing nominations and evaluating the effectiveness of Board Members.158\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 90-94, 97\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 74; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 96.\n\n170.\n\nRespondent submits that, contrary to the remaining members of the Tribunal, the *Vivendi II* committee recognized the conflicts of interest that affected Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler and stated that *\"[s]ince a major international bank has connections with or an interest in virtually any major international company (which companies are also the most likely to end up in international arbitrations), this suggests that the positions of a director of such bank, and that of an international arbitrator, may not be compatible, and should not be, or in a modern international arbitration environment, should no longer be combined.\"* The committee added that \"[a].s *a minimum, the* ad hoc *Committee sees here* reason for extreme caution, especially in ICSID cases where the public interest is often strongly engaged.\"159\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, **A** 81-83 quoting from **AL A RA 67, \u00b6\u00b6** 218-219 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\n171.\n\nRespondent further refers to the **Vivendi II** committee\u2019s analysis of how an arbitrator should handle such a conflict of interest in terms of: (i) investigating any connections between the bank and the parties to the arbitrations; (ii) disclosing any such connections to the parties; and (iii) notifying the parties of the appointment regardless of any connections found. According to the **Vivendi II** committee, such a situation further imposes a *\"continuous duty of investigation\"* on the arbitrator, which it considered not fulfilled by merely providing the bank with a list of current arbitrations together with a request to find out whether there were any conflicts on interests. Respondent submits that, in the committee\u2019s view, the bank was not in a position to decide whether there were conflicts of interests from the perspective of the parties to the arbitrations but it would have been for the arbitrator personally to consider any connection between the bank and the parties and to disclose such connection to the parties.160\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 84-87 quoting from **AL A RA 67, \u00b6\u00b6** 204, 222-226.\n\n172.\n\nRespondent points out that based on these considerations, the *Vivendi II* committee understood the argument that the tribunal was no longer properly constituted and there was a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure, which *\"could lead to annulment whenever justified within the context of the case under consideration\"* Respondent submits that the committee ultimately decided not to annul the award because it did not have sufficient reason to believe that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler knew about the connection between UBS and the claims in that case until after the award was rendered and therefore found that this connection did not have any material effect on the final decision of the tribunal.161 Respondent points out that, by contrast, the Decision on Liability in the present case was issued long after Respondent\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification, and Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s opinion was decisive in light of Prof. Nikken\u2019s dissenting opinion.162\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 88-89 quoting from **AL A RA 67, \u00b6** 232 and citing \u00b6\u00b6 234-235.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 90; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 98.\n\n173.\n\nAs to Claimants\u2019 reliance on the decision in *EDF v. Argentina,* Respondent notes that the underlying facts and thus the conflict of interest were not the same in that case because UBS\u2019s participation in the claimant there was only indirect (via its parent company) and with 1.5% substantially less than the direct shareholdings in the present case. Respondent also refers to the **EDF** committee quoting from a statement made by the *Vivendi II* committee that *\"a larger or smaller participation of UBS in the one or in the other company may have relevance in this connection\"163* In Respondent\u2019s view, the reasoning of the **EDF** committee actually supports its claim that the Award must be annulled on the basis of the facts underlying the present case.164\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 93; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 99-103 quoting from **AL A RA 70, \u00b6** 155. The *EDF* committee noted in the same paragraph that, while in the case before it, the investment in question consisted of a 1.5% shareholding in EDF, the parent company of the claimant EDFI, which was held by the UB S Foundation for the benefit of various Swiss pension funds, it appeared that, by contrast, in *Vivendi II* UBS was the largest shareholder in the claimant itself.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 104-105.\n\n174.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the fact that UBS was the largest shareholder in Vivendi with 2.38% of its shares and a major shareholder in Suez with 2.13% of its shares, valued together at over USD 2 billion, must be considered a *\"fairly significant percentage in terms of value,\"* which arose both from direct investments by UBS and from its purchase of shares for its clients\u2019 accounts and cannot be considered *de minimis* as alleged by Claimants. Respondent further emphasizes that UBS also actively promoted and marketed investments in the water sector, which includes the two Claimants.165\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 94; Argentina\u2019s Reply, **A** 70, 73, 76-77.\n\n175.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, these two aspects created direct interests on the part of UBS in the outcome of the arbitration and thus an *\"extremely serious situation\"* in disregard of *\"fundamental aspects of the right to a fair trial,\" i.e.,* the right to an independent and impartial tribunal. As these conflicts of interests for Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler had a *\"material impact\"* on the Decision on Liability as well as on the Award, Respondent claims that an annulment of the Award is warranted.166\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, **A** 94-97. Respondent argues that the only two cases in which Argentina was held liable to pay compensation on account of a financial debt were *Vivendi* and the present case - in both of which Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler was acting as arbitrator and UBS held a shareholding in Vivendi. Respondent further claims that her involvement led to additional amounts on account of guaranteed debt, which are not insignificant or marginal and would create additional revenues for Suez and Vivendi. Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 78.\n\n176.\n\n\"[A]s *an aggravating factor,\"* Respondent invokes the fact that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler did not disclose her appointment as a member of the UBS Board to the parties to the arbitration - in contrast with her approach to inform UBS about her ongoing arbitrations, indicating that she knew that her appointment could lead in certain cases to a conflict.167 Respondent refers to its expert Prof. Wolfram who concluded that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s failure to investigate or disclose her appointment was an independent cause for disqualification.168\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 71-72.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 83 referring to **Exhibit A RA 66, \u00b6** 13.\n\n177.\n\nAs to the assessment of the two remaining members of the Tribunal that it was *\"perfectly possible for a person to be unaware of the links that connect him or her to others,\"* Respondent argues that this does not account for the specific duty of investigation, disclosure and notification on the part of the arbitrators within the context of an ICSID arbitration, under which Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler would have been required to ask UBS for the necessary information and to inform the parties to these proceedings of the circumstances at hand.169\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 89 quoting from Decision on Disqualification, \u00b6 33.\n\n**2. Summary of Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent argues based on its erroneous assumption that the Committee is empowered to perform a *de novo* review of the arbitrator challenge and refuses to engage with the approaches taken by the *Azurix* and **EDF** committees. Claimants reiterate their view that, even if the substance of that challenge were indeed to be considered by this Committee, this consideration would be limited, in line with the **EDF** committee\u2019s approach, to whether the Tribunal\u2019s decision on Respondent\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification was *\"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision.\"170* According to Claimants, this means that the Committee *\"is not tasked with determining whether Argentina\u2019s challenge was correctly decided, but rather if the Tribunal\u2019s Second Challenge Decision constituted such an egregious violation of certain basic principles that it cannot stand\"171*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 73-74 quoting from **A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 145; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 26.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 25.\n\n179.\n\nClaimants contend that the findings made by the Tribunal in its Decision on Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal for Disqualification are binding in this annulment phase. Specifically, Claimants recall that the Tribunal, in its 28-page decision, qualitatively analyzed the situation and identified four criteria to guide its assessment: proximity, intensity, dependence, and materiality. Based on these criteria, the Tribunal found that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s connections to Suez and Vivendi were remote and immaterial, given in particular the nature of UBS\u2019s *\"passive, portfolio\"* investments in Suez and Vivendi that amounted to only 0,056% of UBS\u2019s total investments during the relevant period. In addition, it found that Respondent had not been able to prove any impact of the arbitration on the share price of Suez and Vivendi, let alone any effect on UBS or Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s interests.172\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 76-78; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 27-32.\n\n180.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Tribunal\u2019s findings were *\"firmly grounded in the factual record and cannot be revisited on annulment,\"* even if there were any factual or legal errors in the Tribunal\u2019s assessment. In particular, Claimants note that the expert report of Prof. Wolfram was considered and rejected by the Tribunal and therefore cannot be considered *de novo* by this Committee. In any event, Claimants emphasize that Prof. Wolfram\u2019s *\"extreme opinions\"* were rejected not only by the Tribunal in the present case but also by the **EDF** tribunal and the **EDF** annulment committee.173\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 80-81; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\n181.\n\nAs to the fiduciary duty that Respondent heavily relies on in its Application, Claimants argue that Respondent did not establish how Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler would have been under a duty to corrupt an international arbitration proceeding involving a sovereign state, which could have endangered UBS\u2019s reputation. In any event, Claimants submit that any fiduciary duty ended when Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler resigned from the UBS Board in 2009, *i.e.,* before both the Decision on Liability and the Award were rendered.174\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 82.\n\n182.\n\nWith regard to Respondent\u2019s reliance on the criticism of Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s handling of the issue voiced by the *Vivendi II* committee, Claimants argue that this decision was rendered in a *\"very different context,\"* as there was no prior challenge decision in that case and the committee thus had to consider the question *\"as a matter of first impression at the annulment stage\"* Claimants further emphasize that, despite its criticism, the *Vivendi II* committee nevertheless concluded that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s independence and impartiality were not impaired by her relationship with UBS and did not justify an annulment of the Award. By contrast, Claimants reiterate that the only permissible question before this Committee is whether the Tribunal\u2019s decision on Respondent\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification was *\"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision\"175*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 83-84 quoting from **A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 145.\n\n183.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s additional argument that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler failed to investigate and disclose potential conflicts of interests arising out of her appointment, Claimants submit that the failure to disclose a fact in itself cannot give rise to a lack of independence and impartiality. In any event, Claimants emphasize that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler did not know about UBS\u2019s minor shareholdings in Suez and Vivendi and thus could not be under a duty to disclose a fact of which she was unaware. In addition, Claimants note that the Tribunal considered any such duty satisfied by Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s approach to provide a list of her ongoing arbitrations to UBS in order for the bank to, *inter alia,* perform a conflict check, and concluded that it was reasonable for her to rely on the investigation results provided by UBS.176\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 85-87; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 35 referring to Decision on Disqualification, \u00b6 48.\n\n184.\n\nFinally, Claimants note that the Tribunal\u2019s allegedly *\"soplainly unreasonable\"* decision was in fact consistent with the decision of the **EDF** tribunal - endorsed by the **EDF** committee - refusing to disqualify Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler in *\"virtually identical circumstances\"177* In Claimants\u2019 view, the *\"fundamental similarity\"* between the two cases is that UBS\u2019s interests in the respective claims were *de minimis.* Claimants acknowledge that the **EDF** committee did take note of the differences between the relative size of UBS\u2019s interests in the respective claimants, but argue that the **EDF** committee did not engage in any analysis about whether UBS\u2019s holding in Suez and Vivendi were greater than *de minimis -* contrary to the Tribunal in the present case, whose finding that they were *\"not material to UBS\u2019s financial performance, profitability, or share price\"* was thus in line with the findings of the *EDF* tribunal.178\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 74 referring to **A/CLA-33** and **A/CLA-61.**\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 36-37 quoting from Decision on Disqualification, \u00b6 40.\n\n185.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, the fact that both tribunals, as recognized by the *EDF* committee, *\"reached the same decision\"* based on a common factual premise is conclusive evidence that the Tribunal\u2019s decision *\"was, at the very least, reasonable\"* and Respondent\u2019s Application must therefore be rejected.179\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 88-89; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39.\n\n**3. Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n186.\n\nIn relation to Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s appointment to the Board of Directors of UBS, Respondent advances two grounds for annulment: (i) that the Tribunal was no longer properly constituted (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention); and (ii) that there was a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n187.\n\nIn its Proposal for Disqualification and again in this annulment proceeding, Respondent has raised two separate arguments on the basis of which it considers that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler lacked impartiality and independence of judgment as required under Article 14(1): (i) the fact of her directorship in UBS, which is a shareholder in two of the Claimants (Suez and Vivendi) and engages in certain activities relating to the water sector, as of April 2006 (and until April 2009); and (ii) her failure to disclose the fact of her UBS directorship to the Parties and the Tribunal as required under the ICSID regime.\n\n188.\n\nThe Committee recalls that in order to find that a ground for annulment exists under the standard of review of Articles 52(1)(a) and 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention, the Decision on Disqualification rendered by the two remaining members of the Tribunal would have to be *\"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision\"180* In assessing whether this is the case, the Committee will further bear in mind that the underlying purpose of this standard is to safeguard the fundamental integrity of ICSID arbitration proceedings.\n\n*Cf.* **AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 145.\n\n189.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, there are circumstances in which a decision could be considered **\"plainly unreasonable,\" e.g.,** if a disqualification proposal was dismissed even though the challenged arbitrator was appointed to the Board of Directors of one of the parties, or was previously consulted by one of the parties on the subject-matter of the case. The seriousness of these examples is corroborated by the fact that they are also captured on the Non-waivable or Waivable Red List of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration **(\"IBA Guidelines\"****).** There may even be circumstances in which a failure of the challenged arbitrator to disclose substantial circumstances to the Parties could render the decision of the remaining arbitrators **\"plainly unreasonable,\" e.g.,** if a disqualification proposal was dismissed even though the challenged arbitrator failed to disclose that he or she recently served as counsel for one of the parties. Thus, even situations captured in the Orange List of the IBA Guidelines could, in certain circumstances, be of such a seriousness that it could compromise the fundamental integrity of the proceedings and thus would warrant annulment of the award.\n\n190.\n\nIt will be for this Committee to assess whether the circumstances of the present case give rise to a conflict of interest that is of a comparable seriousness and threat to the fundamental integrity of ICSID arbitration proceedings, which renders the Tribunal\u2019s decision *\"plainly unreasonable \"*\n\n191.\n\nAsa preliminary remark, the Committee wishes to emphasize that, contrary to Respondent\u2019s allegation, it cannot detect a lack of seriousness in the Tribunal\u2019s181 Decision on Disqualification. The Committee rather considers that the language used in the Decision182 reflects the attempt to circumscribe the difficulties of assessing conflicts of interest in today\u2019s globalized world where it would be impossible to expect from arbitrators to either not have, or to always be aware of, each and every connection to a business on whose disputes they may be called to decide. The Tribunal used this description as a basis for its finding that the simple existence of just any connection between an arbitrator and a party cannot be sufficient for a successful challenge but that the *\"alleged connection must be evaluated* qualitatively.\"183\n\nFor ease of reference, the Committee will refer to *\"the Tribunal\u2019* and its findings in the Decision on Disqualification but it is of course aware that the Decision on Disqualification was rendered by the two remaining members of the Tribunal, *i.e.,* excluding Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler.\n\nThe language Respondent refers to reads: *\"Arbitrators are not disembodied spirits dwelling on Mars, who descend to earth to arbitrate a case and then immediately return to their Martian retreat to await inertly the call to arbitrate another. Like other professionals living and working in the world, arbitrators have a variety of complex connections with all sorts of persons and institutions.\"* Decision on Disqualification, \u00b6 32.\n\nDecision on Disqualification, 32-33 (emphasis in original).\n\n192.\n\nThe Committee further notes that the facts underlying the Decision on Disqualification are undisputed between the Parties and considers that these have not significantly changed since the Decision was rendered in May 2008. While Respondent raised two additional facts, *i.e.,* that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler: (i) *\"had come to have an even greater influence in the Board of Directors of UBS\"* when she was appointed chair of UBS\u2019s Nominating Committee in May 2008;184 and (ii) decided to end her role at UBS after the expiration of her three-year term in April 2009, it must be noted that Respondent itself, when it became aware of these facts, apparently did not consider them sufficiently severe to file a further proposal for disqualification.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 74.\n\n193.\n\nIn addition, the Committee does not view Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s decision to step down from the Board as an admission of a conflict of interest but rather as a decision made on the basis of the ongoing agitations her role had caused in the arbitrations she was involved in. If anything, the Committee considers that this additional fact reduces the significance of any potential conflict of interest because her role at UBS persisted only for three out of a total of 12 years of proceedings and, while this time period included the unanimous Decision on Jurisdiction, as well as pleadings and the hearing on the merits, Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler resigned from the UBS board more than a year before the Decision on Liability was issued and approximately six years before the Award was rendered.\n\n194.\n\nConsequently, the Committee is of the view that the factual basis underlying the Decision on Disqualification has not changed in a manner that would justify a re-consideration of the facts, *i.e.,* a review beyond the scope identified above.\n\n195.\n\nIn their submissions, both Parties heavily relied on decisions of previous committees that considered challenges to Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler similar to the one raised in the present case. However, while the Committee does consider the findings made by other committees and tribunals relevant and will turn to them in due course, it will first perform its own analysis of whether the Decision on Disqualification rendered by the two remaining members of the Tribunal is *\"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision\"185*\n\n*Cf.* **AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 145.\n\n**a. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nIn its qualitative assessment of the connection between Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler and two of the Claimants, the Tribunal noted that neither the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Arbitration Rules nor Respondent in its submissions provided any guidance for evaluating the connection and its effect on Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s independence and impartiality. The Tribunal therefore identified four criteria that it considered particularly important:\n\n(i) proximity of the connection between the challenged arbitrator and the party; (ii) intensity and frequency of the interactions between the challenged arbitrator and the party; (iii) dependence of the challenged arbitrator on the party; and (iv) materiality of the benefits accruing to the challenged arbitrator as a result of the alleged connection.186 The Tribunal then established the facts underlying Respondent\u2019s challenge, *i.e.,* in particular regarding the significance of the shares that UBS held in Suez and Vivendi, as well as the role Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler had as an independent director at UBS. In the context of the former, the Tribunal made, *inter alia,* the following findings:\n\n*\"While the market value of* [UBS\u2019s] *shareholdings may seem large in absolute terms, they are not significant in relative terms, bearing in mind that UBS manages hundred of billions of dollars in assets.... Despite the size of its holdings, UBS is a passive, portfolio investor in both companies.* *... While a part of such shares are held for UBS\u2019s own account, a large portion is managed on behalf of clients.... [T]he Respondent... offered no quantitative evidence at all as to the potential effect of an award in favor of the Claimants on the price of their shares or the nature of their dividend distributions.*... [I]t *is more likely that this arbitration, whatever its outcome, will have a negligible effect on the share price of Vivendi and Suez and certainly on the financial fortunes of UBS.\"187*\n\nDecision on Disqualification, \u00b6 35.\n\nDecision on Disqualification, \u00b6 36.\n\n197.\n\nAs regards Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s role as an independent director of UBS, the Tribunal held that pursuant to Swiss law and UBS Articles of Association:\n\n*\"The directors are not full-time employees of the corporations, are not in continuous session, and exercise largely a supervisory function over the* *activities of the corporation. As a result, Professor Kaufmann-Kohler is not involved in the day-to-day management of the corporation, such as selecting investments or preparing research reports, does not have responsibilities over the investment and management of corporate or client assets, and in fact was unaware until reading the Respondent\u2019s Second Proposal for her disqualification that UBS owned shares in Vivendi or Suez.... Respondent offered no evidence to the contrary with regard to Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s specific duties and responsibilities as a member of the UBS board of directors\"188*\n\nDecision on Disqualification, \u00b6 39.\n\n198.\n\nFinally, it applied these facts to the four criteria it had identified and found that:\n\n(i) *\"any connection between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the Claimants Vivendi and Suez is remote and certainly not direct\";*\n\n(ii) *\"there is no interaction at all between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the Claimants by virtue of her UBS directorship\";*\n\n(iii) *\"Professor Kaufmann-Kohler derives no benefits or advantages from and is in no way dependent on the Claimants as a result of the alleged connection\" ;* and\n\n(iv) *\"UBS shareholdings in Claimant Vivendi and Suez are not material to UBS financial performance, profitability, or share price and in no way affect the compensation that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler earns as a director of UBS\"*\n\nThe Tribunal thus concluded that the alleged connection between Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler and the Claimants did not create a manifest lack of independence and impartiality of judgment.189\n\nDecision on Disqualification, \u00b6 40.\n\n199.\n\nIn its assessment of whether Prof. Kaufmann Kohler's failure to disclose the fact of her UBS directorship to the Parties and the Tribunal indicated a manifest lack of the qualities in Article 14(1), the Tribunal held that while Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, as applicable when the arbitration was commenced, did not specifically address the disclosure of facts arising after the constitution of the Tribunal, this provision should be interpreted to impose a continuing obligation of disclosure on the arbitrators.190 The Tribunal noted, however, that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler had not been aware of the fact that UBS held shares in Suez and Vivendi prior to Respondent\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification and considered that she could thus not have been required to disclose such fact.191 As regards Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s approach to provide a list of her ongoing arbitrations to UBS to determine, *inter alia,* whether any of them conflicted with her future responsibilities at UBS, the Tribunal held:\n\n*\"We believe that she had reason to rely on the UBS examination of this question since UBS, under Swiss banking law and the corporate and stock exchange rules to which it is subject, had a strong incentive to ascertain her independence because the company would have encountered legal and regulatory difficulties should it represent her as an independent director and later find that a court, regulatory agency, or stock exchange had determined her to be non-independent director of the UBS board of directors. It was therefore reasonable to rely on the investigation by UBS that no conflict existed between Professor Kaufmann-Kohler and the parties in any of her arbitrations (with the exception of the America cup) as a result of becoming a UBS director. Consequently, we do not believe that she had a duty to inquire further. Moreover, even if it were established that she did have such an obligation (which we do not believe is the case), her failure to do was in our opinion the result of an honest exercise of judgment and was not part of a pattern of circumstances raising doubts about impartiality.\"*\n\nThe Tribunal thus concluded that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler had no duty to inquire further and thus did not act in violation of Rule 6 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.192\n\nDecision on Disqualification, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\nDecision on Disqualification, \u00b6 46.\n\nDecision on Disqualification, \u00b6 48.\n\n**b. The Committee\u2019s Considerations on the Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nContrary to Respondent\u2019s allegation and in particular taking into account the absence of any evaluation criteria provided in the applicable rules, by the Parties or by ICSID jurisprudence, the Committee considers that it was within the Tribunal\u2019s reasonable discretion to perform a qualitative assessment of whether there was a *\"manifest\"* lack of the qualities in Article 14(1) as required by Article 57 and to identify certain criteria it considered particularly relevant to its assessment.\n\n201.\n\nAs for the Tribunal\u2019s understanding of the underlying facts as well as the application of these facts to the criteria it had identified, it has to be reiterated that it is not for this Committee to substitute its own views for the conclusions drawn by the Tribunal in this regard. The review of this Committee under Article 52(1)(a) and (d) of the ICSID Convention is rather limited to an assessment of whether the conclusions reached by the Tribunal were *\"plainly unreasonable*.\" Therefore, the fact that the Committee may not share all of the views expressed by the Tribunal and in fact agree with some of the criticism expressed by the committee in *Vivendi II v. Argentina,* as further set out below, is not decisive. Contrary to the *Vivendi II* committee, this Committee is not called upon to make a first-time assessment of the matters at hand; it is faced with an existing decision, which shall stand unless it is *\"plainly unreasonable\"*\n\n202.\n\nRespondent criticizes in particular that while its expert Prof. Wolfram identified at least two forms of interest that UBS had in Suez and Vivendi, *i.e.,* an *\"economic\"* self-interest in Claimants\u2019 favor and a *\"loyalty\"* interest, the Tribunal failed to address in its Decision on Disqualification the fiduciary duty and institutional loyalty of Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler to protect and advance UBS\u2019s interests in Claimants. In addition, Respondent argues that it was incorrect for the Tribunal to state that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s compensation as a UBS director was *\"in no way affect[ed]\"* by UBS\u2019s shareholdings in Claimants because she in fact received between 50% and 100% of her compensation in UBS stock.\n\n203.\n\nAs noted above, there are circumstances in which a decision not to disqualify a challenged arbitrator could be considered *\"plainly unreasonable,\"* in particular circumstances such as those captured on the Non-waivable and Waivable Red List of the IBA Guidelines. In the Committee\u2019s view, the undisputed fact that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler received a certain amount of her compensation in UBS stock does not indicate a conflict of interest that is of a comparably serious nature and thus a threat to the fundamental integrity of the arbitration proceedings. As found by the Tribunal and not to be re-considered by this Committee, UBS\u2019s shareholdings in Suez and Vivendi are *\"not material to UBS financial performance, profitability, or share price\"193* In addition, the Tribunal noted that it had not been presented with evidence that a favorable award would have more than a *\"negligible effect\"* on Claimants\u2019 share price and *\"certainly on the financial fortunes of UBS.\"194*\n\nDecision on Disqualification, \u00b6 40.\n\nDecision on Disqualification, \u00b6 36.\n\n204.\n\nAs to the alleged *\"loyalty\"* interest raised by Prof. Wolfram, which was not addressed by the Tribunal, the Committee recalls its agreement with the finding of the *EDF* committee that Article 52(1)(d) *\"does not... require a tribunal to discuss in detail any particular item of evidence in detail, or at all, where it is not necessary to do so in order to decide the questions before it.\"195* It is apparent from the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning that in light of the negligible significance of UBS\u2019s shareholdings compared to its total investments as well as its role as a passive portfolio investor that held a large portion of such shares on behalf of its clients, the Tribunal considered that there was no significant link between an award in Claimants\u2019 favor and UBS\u2019s interests. As a result, there was no need from the Tribunal\u2019s perspective to discuss particular forms of interest, none of which would have been affected in a significant manner.\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 350.\n\n205.\n\nIn this context, the Committee notes that the IBA Guidelines, on which both Parties relied in their written and oral submissions, include in their Green List of situations in which disclosure is not required when *\"[t]he arbitrator holds an insignificant amount of shares in one of the parties or an affiliate of one of the parties, which is publicly listed\"196* If it can be considered that UBS\u2019s shareholdings in the Claimants are *\"insignificant\u2019* and would not constitute a relevant conflict of interest between those parties, the same must apply, *a fortiori,* to the even more remote connection between Claimants and Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler, who herself did not hold any shares in any of the Claimants but only served as an independent director of the corporation that held such shares. This classification within the ranking of circumstances within the IBA Guidelines, while not being dispositive in itself, corroborates the Committee\u2019s finding that the circumstances relied on by Respondent are not comparable to those that can give rise to a *\"plainly unreasonable\"* decision.\n\n**Exhibit A RA 59, \u00b6** 4.5.2. The Committee observes that a revised version of the IBA Guidelines was adopted in 2014. However, as far as the examples referred to in this section are concerned, no substantive changes have been introduced.\n\n206.\n\nAs to the second limb of Respondent\u2019s allegation, *i.e.,* the fact that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler failed to disclose her directorship in UBS to the parties to the arbitration, the Committee\u2019s review is again limited to assessing whether the Tribunal\u2019s assessment that Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler had no duty to disclose her directorship in UBS because she was not aware of UBS\u2019s shareholdings in Suez and Vivendi and could reasonably rely on the investigation conducted by UBS is *\"plainly unreasonable*.\" While the Committee again may not share all of the views expressed by the Tribunal and understands the criticism expressed by the *Vivendi II* committee as regards her reliance on the UBS investigation rather than evaluating potential connections herself, and her decision to notify the bank but not the parties to the arbitration, this does not entail that the Tribunal reached a *\"plainly unreasonable\"* decision.\n\n207.\n\nIn this regard, the Committee notes that the Tribunal gave detailed reasons as to why it considered it reasonable for Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler to rely on the outcome of the UBS investigation. In particular, it assessed the applicable Swiss banking law as well as the corporate and stock exchange rules that UBS is subject to and concluded that it was in the interest of the bank to ascertain her independence before appointing her as director. While one may take a different view as to the question of whether Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler could reasonably defer to the bank as regards the assessment of whether any possible connections between UBS and any of the parties to her ongoing arbitrations amounted to a conflict of interest, this circumstance alone is not of a seriousness comparable to the examples set out above, that would compromise the fundamental integrity of the arbitration proceedings. Bearing this underlying purpose of the Committee\u2019s standard of review in mind, the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the scope of Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s duties cannot be considered *\"plainly unreasonable,\"* and consequently, does not constitute a manifest excess of powers nor a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n**c. The Committee\u2019s Considerations on Relevant Case Law**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nFinally, the Committee will turn to the case law invoked by the Parties, in particular to the decisions rendered in *Vivendi II v. Argentina,* relied on by Respondent, and in *EDF v. Argentina,* relied on by Claimants.\n\n209.\n\nThe *Vivendi II* committee considered that a director\u2019s *\"fiduciary duty* vis-\u00e0-vis *the shareholders of the bank to further the interests of the bank and therefore postpone conflicting interests... is fundamentally at variance with his or her duty as independent arbitrators in an arbitration involving a party in which the bank has a shareholding or other interest, however small it may be.\"* Given the various connections between international banks and international companies, the committee considered that the positions of director and arbitrator should either no longer be combined or, \"[a].s *a minimum,\"* the arbitrator should approach this with *\"extreme caution\"* and *\"make a special effort that the conflicts that may so arise are managed properly and handled with the greatest care\"* The committee further held that the continuous duty of investigation prompted thereby *\"cannot be considered fulfilled by simply providing the bank at the time of the appointment with a list of current arbitrations accompanied by a request to see whether there may be any conflicts of interests\"* Rather, it would have been *\"for the arbitrator personally first to consider such a connection in terms of a voluntary resignation as arbitrator. Such connection must otherwise be properly disclosed to the parties through an adequate amendment of earlier declarations under Rule 6\"197*\n\n**AL A RA 67, \u00b6\u00b6** 217-226.\n\n210.\n\nIn addition, the *Vivendi II* committee considered it *\"difficult to understand why the bank was notified by Professor Kaufmann-Kohler of her existing arbitrations but not the arbitrating parties of her (impending) directorship of the bank at the same time\"* The committee thus *\" underst[ood] the argument that the Second Tribunal was no longer properly constituted after the board appointment of Professor Kaufmann-Kohler, and that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure and consider[ed] that this could lead to annulment whenever justified within the context of the case under consideration\"* It ultimately decided that there was not sufficient ground to annul the award, however, because Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler had become aware of the connection between UBS and the claims only after the award was rendered and such connection thus *\"had no material effect on the final decision of the Tribunal, which was in any event unanimous\"198*\n\n**AL A RA 67, \u00b6\u00b6** 229-235.\n\n211.\n\nIt has to be reiterated that the *Vivendi II* committee was in a situation different from the one this Committee is faced with because in *Vivendi II,* there was no existing decision of the remaining members of the tribunal to be evaluated but the committee rather had to evaluate the facts underlying Argentina\u2019s allegation for the first time in those proceedings.\n\n212.\n\nThe *EDF* committee on the other hand had to evaluate a situation similar to the present one because it was not only faced with an existing decision and apparently also with similar evidence, but the underlying facts were also quite similar. In particular, the Committee is not convinced that, as alleged by Respondent, it makes a considerable difference that UBS held no direct shares in the claimant in that case but rather in its parent company. The same applies to the fact that UBS\u2019s shares in EDF\u2019s parent company amounted to 1.5% rather than to 2.13% and 2.38%, respectively, as in this case.\n\n213.\n\nWhile the *EDF* committee had to evaluate a decision rendered by two different arbitrators, it also expressed an opinion on the Decision on Disqualification rendered in the present case and held that both decisions *\"are carefully reasoned and comprehensive in their consideration of the issues\"199* Said committee noted that the fact that at least one other tribunal, *i.e.,* the Tribunal in the present case, had reached the same conclusion as the *EDF* tribunal, supported the conclusion that there were grounds *\"on which any reasonable decision-maker could, and would be likely to, conclude that there was no basis for holding that Professor Kaufmann-Kohler manifestly lacked the requisite independence and impartiality.\"200* These grounds included the following considerations: (i) UBS held the shares in the claimants\u2019 parent company for the benefit of a third party (which is the case for part of the shares in the present case as well); (ii) the investment was relatively insignificant when seen in the context of the overall size of UBS\u2019s investments; and (iii) Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler was not responsible for, and not even involved in, the management of this investment.\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 161.\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 162.\n\n214.\n\nAs Claimants correctly pointed out, three different bodies, *i.e.,* the Tribunal in the present case, the **EDF** tribunal and the **EDF** committee, have reached the same conclusions and decision on very similar facts. While the Committee considers that this fact alone would not be sufficient in itself to deny Respondent\u2019s application for annulment on this ground, it does serve as a strong indication supporting the Committee\u2019s conclusion that the Tribunal\u2019s decision was not *\"so plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a decision\"*\n\n215.\n\nIn addition, Claimants pointed to the decision rendered by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in *Argentina v. AWG Group Ltd., i.e.,* the *vacatur* proceeding that was initiated against the Award rendered by the Tribunal, to the extent it concerned the claims of the fourth claimant whose case was decided under the UNCITRAL Rules.201 The US District Court considered Argentina\u2019s application under the FAA Act and the *vacatur* grounds *of\" evident partiality\"* in its Section 10.202 While noting that UBS did not hold any shares in AWG Group, it also described the shareholdings in Suez and Vivendi as *\"trivial\"* and *\"tangential\"203* The Court decided that the evidence submitted by Argentina was *\"wholly insufficient\"* to establish its claim of *\"evidentpartiality\"* because: (i) UBS\u2019s *\"fairly small, if not fractional'* interests in Suez and Vivendi as well as Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s role and compensation in UBS stock were *\"inconsequential'* in light of the size of UBS\u2019s worldwide financial dealings; (ii) Argentina\u2019s claim that UBS conducted research in and developed financial products related to the water sector *\"contributes little\"* to its claim; and (iii) Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler had no duty to disclose *\"marginally disclosable''* facts to the Parties as it was *\"eminently reasonable\"* for her to rely on UBS informing her of\" *meaningful conflicts\"204* The Court concluded that *\"[t]he record here does not objectively suggest that the challenged arbitrator had any reason to be biased against Argentina\"* and thus agreed with the conclusion reached in the Decision on Disqualification in respect of AWG Group.205\n\nAWG Group Ltd. for its part filed a cross-petition seeking confirmation, recognition and enforcement of the Award. **A/CLA-118,** pp. 1, 10.\n\nThe Court also considered the *vacatur* ground that the *\"arbitrators exceeded their powers\"* in respect of the Tribunal\u2019s computation of damages and its evaluation of the necessity defense. **A/CLA-118,** p. 31.\n\n**A/CLA-118,** pp. 16, 26.\n\n**A/CLA-118,** pp. 24-29.\n\n**A/CLA-118,** pp. 30-31.\n\n216.\n\nRespondent correctly pointed out that the decision of the US District Court was not rendered within the context of the annulment grounds to be assessed under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. However, the Committee does not agree that the decision thus lacks any relevance for the present assessment of whether the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion was *\"plainly unreasonable.\"* Even though rendered under a different standard, *i.e.,* the standard of *\"evident partiality\"* under Section 10(2) of the FAA, the Court assessed the same facts and, more importantly, the same Decision on Disqualification that is now before this Committee. Moreover, the Court fully agreed with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that *\"[a]n objective analysis... does not... lead a reasonable, informed person to conclude that a justifiable doubt exists as to Professor Kaufmann-Kohler\u2019s impartiality or independence\"* with respect to AWG Group.206\n\n**A/CLA-118,** pp. 30-31 quoting from Decision on Disqualification, \u00b6 24.\n\n217.\n\nEven though the Court only had to decide on the Award to the extent it concerned AWG Group, it also opined on UBS\u2019s interests in Suez and Vivendi and made it clear in its reasoning that it would not have come to a different conclusion with respect to these two Claimants. While the Committee again may not agree with all of the findings made by the US Court, the decision further supports this Committee\u2019s conclusion that the decision reached by the Tribunal in its Decision on Disqualification was not *\"plainly unreasonable.\"*\n\n**d. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n218.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee again emphasizes that it is not its task to re-consider the facts as presented to the Tribunal and perform a *de novo* assessment of whether Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler *\"manifestly\"* lacked the qualities of impartiality and independence of judgment. Having carefully examined the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Disqualification and having also taken into account the case law relied on by the Parties, the Committee has not identified any circumstances, which could give rise to a conflict of interest of such a seriousness that it would render the Decision *\"plainly unreasonable\"* in terms of compromising the fundamental integrity of the arbitration proceedings and that, thus, would warrant annulment of the Award.\n\n219.\n\nThe Committee therefore finds that the Tribunal was neither improperly constituted nor was there a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. Consequently, the first ground for annulment advanced by Respondent is dismissed.\n\n**B. Second Set of Grounds for Annulment Relating to the Alleged Failure to Comply with the Requirement to Submit the Case to the Local Courts for 18 Months**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nRespondent submits that, by ruling in its Decision on Jurisdiction that the Spanish national AGBAR could benefit from the dispute settlement provisions contained in the Argentina-France BIT by virtue of the MFN clause, the Tribunal exerted jurisdiction without the requirements of Argentina\u2019s consent under Article X of the Argentina-Spain BIT being met. According to Respondent, the Tribunal thereby manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention), failed to state the reasons on which its decision was based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention) and seriously departed from fundamental rules of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).207\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, **\u00b6** 38; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, **\u00b6\u00b6** 102-103; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 106.\n\n221.\n\nRespondent claims that the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation that the MFN clause contained in the Argentina-Spain BIT applied to dispute settlement provisions and thus exempted AGBAR from complying with the local-court requirement in Article X(3) amounts to a manifest excess of powers. In Respondent\u2019s view, an arbitral tribunal cannot set aside this express requirement of consent, which was voluntarily agreed on by the Contracting States, *\"under the unfounded pretext that this situation is unfavourable to the foreign investor,\"208* Respondent argues that by replacing the express terms of consent, an *\"essential requirement for international tribunals\"* that must be *\"clear and unambiguous,\"* with inferences and assumptions, the Tribunal acted without Argentina\u2019s consent and thus exceeded the limits of its jurisdiction.209\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 111, 113; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 107.\n\n222.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Tribunal\u2019s excess of power is *\"manifest,\"* in terms of *\"apparent on a mere reading of the Award,\"* given that the Tribunal recognized the local-court requirement as a mandatory condition with which AGBAR had not complied. In addition, Respondent claims that, *ex abundanti cautela,* a tribunal\u2019s failure to act within its jurisdiction always amounts to a manifest excess of powers.210\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 115; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 120.\n\n223.\n\nIn addition, Respondent claims that the Tribunal\u2019s disregard for a mandatory requirement amounts to a failure to apply the applicable law, which also qualifies as a manifest excess of powers warranting the annulment of the Award.211\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 117.\n\n224.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, the excess of powers also relates to the Tribunal\u2019s failure to state reasons in support of its jurisdiction, given that it expressly recognized the local-court requirement in Article X of the Argentina-Spain BIT, *i.e.,* the only provision under which an ICSID tribunal has jurisdiction. Respondent argues that this failure is not remedied by the Tribunal\u2019s reference to the MFN clause in Article IV, which is not part of the offer to arbitrate contained in the Treaty. According to Respondent, there has to be a clear, unequivocal intent of the Contracting State that an MFN clause should extend to dispute settlement provisions, which is not present here.212\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 104, 114, 116; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 108-109, 129.\n\n225.\n\nRespondent argues that the Tribunal *\"never explained how or where the term* \u2018all matters\u2019 *in connection with the term* \u2018treatment\u2019 *in Article IV may be applied to jurisdictional matters, which can be clearly distinguished from* \u2018substantive matters\u2019.\" In particular, Respondent takes the view that the Tribunal\u2019s finding that *\"dispute settlement is as important as other matters governed by the BITs and is an integral part of the investment protection regime that the respective sovereign states have agreed upon\"* does not provide such explanation and fails to apply the interpretation principle of Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.213\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 105-106; Argentina\u2019s Reply, 110-111 quoting from Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 59.\n\n226.\n\nLikewise, Respondent considers that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for rejecting Respondent\u2019s argument based on the *ejusdem generis* principle, given that it simply concluded, without giving any reasons, that it *\"finds no basis for applying the* ejusdem generis *principle to arrive at that result.\"214*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 112 quoting from Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 59.\n\n227.\n\nRespondent further submits that, while considering the subsequent practice of the United Kingdom to support its finding, the Tribunal did not give any consideration to subsequent practice of Argentina. Respondent refers to several BITs it concluded with third-party States that contained the same local-court requirement as Article X(3) and only one BIT with Chile that did not contain this requirement; in Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal\u2019s failure to discuss this practice and the essential nature of the dispute settlement clause warrants annulment of the Award.215\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, 108-110 referring to Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 58.\n\n228.\n\nIn response to Claimants\u2019 submission that Respondent never raised its subsequent practice before the Tribunal, Respondent refers to its Memorial on Jurisdiction where it stated that *\"[considering that Argentina, Spain and the United Kingdom have signed Bilateral Treaties of Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments previous to the BIT under analysis, in which they dispensed the 18-month period provided by Article X of the BIT with Spain and Article 8 of the BIT with \u00b6\u00b6, the application of the MFN CLA USE principle to this case implies a violation of this basic principle of interpretation implied in the regulations provided for in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.\"* Evidently, Respondent argues, when negotiating this clause, the Parties must have given it an intended meaning which is submitting the case to local bodies before making any international claims.216 Respondent submits that the Tribunal should have addressed this practice and not only the practice of the \u00b6\u00b6 before disregarding the *\"clear and express terms of the fundamental dispute settlement provision\"* of the Argentina-Spain BIT.217\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 113 quoting from **Exhibit A RA 74,** 142 (emphasis added by Respondent).\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 114.\n\n229.\n\nRespondent further contends that the Tribunal failed to take into account the arguments Respondent presented in its written and oral submissions, in particular the interpretation of the other Contracting State, Spain, in *WcMajfezini* case, according to which the MFN clause does not apply to dispute settlement provisions.218\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6 41.\n\n230.\n\nFinally, with regard to a serious departure from fundamental rules of procedure, Respondent argues that by failing to respect Argentina\u2019s consent to the Treaty, the Tribunal departed from a rule of procedure. In Respondent\u2019s view, this departure is *\"serious\"* because the outcome of the arbitration would otherwise have been substantially different, which again warrants annulment of the Award.219\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 118.\n\n231.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimants\u2019 argument that it intends to have its jurisdictional arguments revisited and states that *\"[father, it seeks to demonstrate how, had they been considered by applying the proper law and had procedural rules been complied with, the outcome would have been radically different\"* While acknowledging that Claimants cited precedents, which considered that a tribunal\u2019s decision to allow an invocation of the MFN clause to circumvent a local-court requirement is not an annullable error, Respondent argues that these precedents do not justify the rejecting of the arguments it has put forward. In this context, Respondent refers in particular to its argument that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in exercising jurisdiction over the case without Respondent\u2019s consent.220\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 115-121.\n\n232.\n\nRespondent claims that its position has been recently affirmed by the tribunal in *ICS v. Argentina* and, within the annulment context, by the decision of the Swedish Court of Appeal rendered in *Quasar de Valores et al. v. Russia,* which annulled the award on the grounds that the MFN clause had been used in excess of jurisdiction. Respondent submits that the Court placed emphasis on the importance of the Parties\u2019 consent and found that the dispute settlement provision did not extend to the claimants\u2019 claim. In respect of the MFN clause invoked by the claimants, the Court held that *\"the determining factor is the wording of the MFN clause in the relevant case,\"* as a result of which it then analyzed the content and scope of the MFN clause. Respondent further points to the Court\u2019s finding that the term *\"treatment\"* included in the MFN clause referred to the FET standard in the treaty, which *\"cannot be deemed to include an unconditional right for investors to have their cases decided by an international arbitral tribunal\";* it therefore concluded that the tribunal could not base its jurisdiction on the dispute resolution clause of a different treaty.221\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 122-128 quoting from **AL A RA 99,** p. 9.\n\n**2. Summary of Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent seeks to reargue its jurisdictional arguments; it never suggests that the Tribunal lacked the power to reach a decision on these arguments but rather claims that it reached the wrong decision. Claimants emphasize that the correctness of the Tribunal\u2019s decision is not to be assessed by this Committee, because a legal error, even if one had been committed, would not amount to an excess of power.222\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 105-107, 114; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.\n\n234.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s submission that an *\"excess of powers is always manifest where a tribunal does not act within the scope of its jurisdiction,\"* Claimants argue that, if this formula were applied, it would convert annulment under Article 52(1)(b) into a *de novo* review of all jurisdictional decisions, would thereby remove all content from the *\"manifest\"* requirement and would contradict *\"extensive authority\"* pursuant to which not every jurisdictional error amounts to an annullable error.223\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, **\u00b6** 54.\n\n235.\n\nClaimants refer to the committee in *Impregiio v. Argentina,* which stated that *\"[n]either applying an MFN clause to jurisdictional issues nor refusing to apply it to assume jurisdiction may be considered, per se, as a manifest excess ofpowers\"* It added that *\"[t]he analysis required to reach a conclusion other than the majority\u2019s would imply a new and complex analysis of the issues at stake, a review that is far from the responsibility of this Committee according to Article* 52.\"224\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 108 quoting from **A/CLA-42 / AL A RA 34, \u00b6** 140.\n\n236.\n\nClaimants also refer to the *Daimler* committee, which concluded on the subject of applying an MFN clause to dispute resolution provisions - which the tribunal there had refused to do - that *\"when more than one interpretation is possible, an award cannot be annulled on the ground that it suffers from an exercise of excess of powers, much less a manifest excess of powers.\"*225\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 110 quoting from **A/CLA-43, \u00b6** 187. Claimants further note that, as the party opposing the annulment application in that case, Respondent itself had advanced this position, which the *Daimler* committee then adopted. *See* also Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 56.\n\n237.\n\nIn addition, Claimants quote from the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment, which records that *\"in light of* [the principle specifically provided by the Convention that the Tribunal is the judge of its own competence], *the drafting history suggests - and most* ad hoc *Committees have reasoned - that in order to annul an award based on a Tribunal\u2019s determination of the scope of its own jurisdiction, the excess of powers must be* \u2018manifest\u2019.\"226\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 54 quoting from **A/CLA-91,** 88.\n\n238.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s reliance on the decision of the Swedish Court of Appeal in *Quasar de Valores et al. v. Russia,* Claimants argue that Respondent fails to explain why the interpretation of a different treaty by a national court should be relevant - taking into account that every ICSID tribunal to have considered the exact same provision at issue in the present case has reached the same conclusion as the Tribunal. In any event, Claimants emphasize that, contrary to annulment committees, Swedish courts are permitted to review a tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional decision *de novo.227*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 55.\n\n239.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law, Claimants point out that the Tribunal did in fact examine the local-court requirement but concluded that the MFN clause - which is also part of the applicable law - granted AGBAR access to arbitration without having observed the local-court requirement. In Claimants\u2019 view, Respondent therefore does not actually argue that the Tribunal did not apply the law but rather expresses its disagreement with the interpretation and conclusion reached by the Tribunal concerning the scope of the MFN clause, which is, not for this Committee to review.228 In any event, Claimants submit that *\"[extensive case law\"* supports the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation, including the unanimous decisions of every one of the five tribunals that up to date decided on the scope of the MFN clause in the Argentina-Spain BIT.229\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 112.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 113 referring to *Teinver v. Argentina (A/CLA-36),* \u00b6 186; *Telef\u00f3nica v. Argentina* **(A/CLA-37, \u00b6\u00b6** 102-105); *Suez, AGBAR and Inter Aguas v. Argentina* **(A/CLA-38), \u00b6** 66; *Gas Natural v. Argentina* **(A/CLA-39),**  \u00b6\u00b6 30-31; *Maffezini v. Spain* **(A/CLA-40), \u00b6** 64.\n\n240.\n\nWith regard to Respondent\u2019s claim that the Tribunal seriously departed from fundamental rules of procedure because it failed to respect the consent of Argentina to the Treaty, Claimants note that Respondent does not identify any fundamental rule of procedure at issue, much less establish how the Tribunal seriously departed from it. Consequently, Claimants submit that Argentina\u2019s Application under this ground should be rejected summarily.230\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 144.\n\n241.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s claim that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its decision, Claimants note that the Tribunal dedicated an entire chapter of its Decision on Jurisdiction to explaining why AGBAR could overcome the local-court requirement, including a careful textual analysis of the relevant Treaty provisions and a discussion of jurisprudence addressing comparable issues as well as the Parties\u2019 respective arguments. In Claimants\u2019 view, Respondent\u2019s arguments are again an attempt to reargue the merits of the Tribunal\u2019s decision because it disagrees with the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion.231\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 157-160; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\n242.\n\nClaimants emphasize that the Tribunal did analyze the term *\"all matters\"* and the term *\"treatment\"',* it found that dispute resolution was a *\"matter\"* covered under the Argentina-Spain BIT and that *\"treatment,\"* pursuant to its ordinary meaning, referred to all rights and obligations conferred upon investors, which includes dispute settlement. Claimants submit that, besides its textual analysis, the Tribunal took into account that there are certain matters to which the MFN clause in Article IV expressly does not apply - but that dispute resolution is not one of them it considered that applying Article IV to treatment in Article X was consistent with the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose; and it noted that other tribunals had interpreted the MFN clause in the Treaty and other treaties in the same manner. In Claimants\u2019 view, Respondent may disagree with these reasons, but they nevertheless qualify as *\"coherent reasons\"* for the Tribunal\u2019s decision.232\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 161-162; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 97.\n\n243.\n\nFinally, with regard to Respondent\u2019s reference to its subsequent treaty practice that the Tribunal allegedly failed to take into account, Claimants submit that Respondent never raised such practice before the Tribunal.233 As to the passage from Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction to which it refers, Claimants emphasize that this passage concerned *previous,* rather than *subsequent,* treaty practice.234\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 163.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 98.\n\n244.\n\nClaimants conclude that Respondent\u2019s real complaint is stated in its Reply where is submits that *\"[T]here are no reasons to allow an MFN Clause to be used to exclude the provision where the Argentine Republic expressly stated the terms of consent\"* In Claimants\u2019 view, this is an argument on the merits and thus inadmissible in an annulment proceeding.235\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 99 quoting from Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 129.\n\n**3. Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n245.\n\nIn the context of the Tribunal\u2019s decision to allow the Claimant AGBAR, *i.e.,* a Spanish national, to invoke the MFN clause in the Argentina-Spain BIT to benefit from the dispute settlement provisions in the Argentina-France BIT, Respondent advances three annulment grounds: (i) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention); (ii) it failed to state the reasons on which its decision was based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention); and (iii) it seriously departed from fundamental rules of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n246.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the statement quoted by Respondent from the Report of the Executive Directors on the ICSID Convention that *\"[c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"236* The Committee further agrees with the statement of the International Court of Justice **(\"ICJ\")** that *\"[w]hen that consent is expressed in a compromissory clause in an international agreement, any conditions to which such consent is subject must be regarded as constituting the limits thereon\"237*\n\n**ALARA 504 \u00b6** 23.\n\n**AL A RA 72, \u00b6** 88.\n\n247.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate in respect of the Claimant AGBAR is given in Article X(3) of the Argentina-Spain BIT, which as recognized by the Tribunal provides for a requirement to bring a judicial proceeding in the host State\u2019s local courts and allows the investor to have recourse to arbitration only after a period of 18 months in those courts. It is further common ground that this requirement qualifies as a condition of Respondent\u2019s consent to arbitrate disputes with Spanish investors. However, AGBAR has invoked the MFN clause in Article IV(2) of the Argentina-Spain BIT in order to benefit from the more favorable treatment provided in the Argentina-France BIT, which does not include a comparable condition of consent. Article IV reads as follows:\n\n*\"TREATMENT*\n\n*1. Each Party shall guarantee in its territory fair and equitable treatment of investments made by investors of the other Party.*\n\n*2. In all matters governed by this Agreement, such treatment shall be no less favorable than that accorded by each Party to investments made in its territory by investors of a third country.*\n\n*3. Such treatment shall not, however, extend to the privileges which either Party may grant to investors of a third State by virtue of its participation in:*\n\n*- A free trade area;*\n\n*- A customs union:*\n\n*- A common market;*\n\n*- A regional integration agreement; or*\n\n*- An organization of mutual economic assistance by virtue of an agreement concluded prior to the entry into force of this Agreement, containing terms similar to those accorded by that Party to participants of said organization.\"*\n\n**a. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nThe Tribunal interpreted the MFN clause and in particular the term *\"[i]n all matters\"* to mean that *\"treatment\"* within the meaning of Article IV(2) includes dispute settlement and therefore that AGBAR is entitled to invoke international arbitration against Argentina on the same terms as the holders of French investments, *i.e.,* without the need to bring the dispute to local courts of Argentina for a period of 18 months.238\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 55.\n\n249.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledged that this interpretation was contested by Respondent and addressed the arguments Respondent had advanced in support of its position that the MFN clause does not extend to dispute settlement provisions. The Tribunal first found that there was no evidence that the Contracting States did not intend Article IV to cover dispute settlement, as alleged by Respondent, and noted in particular that dispute settlement is not among the matters listed in Article IV(3), which are explicitly excluded from the scope of the MFN clause.239 The Tribunal further held that there was no basis for a distinction between dispute settlement matters and any other matters covered by a bilateral investment treaty and thus no basis for applying the *ejusdem generis* principle advanced by Respondent in this regard.240\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 58.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 59.\n\n250.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal addressed Respondent\u2019s claim that the MFN clause should be interpreted strictly and held that there was no reason for interpreting it more strictly than other Treaty provisions; in this context, the Tribunal analyzed the case law relied on by the Parties and found that its conclusion was supported by previous ICSID cases and in particular *Maffezini v. Spain,* which concerned the same Treaty. The Tribunal also discussed the decision in *Plama v. Bulgaria* relied on by Respondent, in which the tribunal had reached a different conclusion, and distinguished that case from the case before it for a number of reasons.241\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 61-67.\n\n251.\n\nIn this annulment proceeding, Claimant further pointed out that up to date there are four other cases in which the tribunals had to decide on the scope of Article IV(2) of the Argentina-Spain BIT: *Maffezini v. Spain,242* which the Tribunal discussed in detail in its Decision on Jurisdiction, *Teinver v. Argentina,243 Telef\u00f3nica v. Argentina,244* and *Gas Natural v. Argentina.245* In all four cases, the tribunals analyzed the scope of the MFN clause in detail and reached the conclusion that it also applied to dispute resolution clauses and permitted the investor to circumvent the local-court requirement in Article X(3).246\n\n**A/CLA-40.**\n\n**A/CLA-36**\n\n**A/CLA-37.**\n\n**A/CLA-39.**\n\n**A/CLA-40, \u00b6** 64; **A/CLA-36, \u00b6** 186; **A/CLA-37, \u00b6** 114; **A/CLA-39, \u00b6** 49.\n\n**b. The Committee\u2019s Considerations on the Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nThe Committee is aware that, contrary to what a recital of the above suggests and as recognized by the tribunals in the above mentioned cases as well as by other tribunals dealing with the same question, ICSID jurisprudence is far from unanimous on the question whether MFN clauses can be invoked by investors to benefit from more favorable dispute settlement provisions in third-State treaties. However, while the MFN clause in Article IV(2) of the Treaty may well be susceptible to an interpretation that is different from that given by the Tribunal in the present case, it is not for this Committee to re-decide the case but rather to assess whether the Tribunal\u2019s decision fulfills any of the annulment grounds advanced by Respondent.\n\n253.\n\nAs to the alleged manifest excess of powers, the Tribunal did not, as Respondent appears to suggest, simply disregard the condition for consent in Article X(3) of Argentina-Spain BIT but it rather gave detailed reasons as to why it considers that AGBAR was permitted to invoke the MFN clause to overcome this requirement. In this regard, this Committee agrees with the committee in *Impregiio v. Argentina,* which found that, as the application of an MFN clause to dispute settlement provisions is a complex and debated issue, *\"[n]either applying an MFN clause to jurisdictional issues nor refusing to apply it to assume jurisdiction may be considered,* per se, *as a manifest excess of powers.\"* As further stated by the *Impregiio* committee, it cannot be the task of the Committee under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention to conduct a new and detailed analysis of the arguments advanced by the Parties in the jurisdictional phase.247 The committee in *Daimler v. Argentina* stated that *\"when more than one interpretation is possible, an award cannot be annulled on the ground that it suffers from an exercise of excess of powers, much less a manifest excess of powers.\"248* The Committee agrees with this statement - except perhaps in extreme circumstances, of which there is no indication in the present case.\n\n**A/CLA-42 /AL A RA 344 \u00b6140.**\n\n**A/CLA-43, \u00b6 187.**\n\n254.\n\nThe same applies to the alleged serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. While the Committee agrees with Respondent that observance of the Parties\u2019 consent does qualify as a fundamental rule of procedure, the Committee cannot follow Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal\u2019s decision to permit AGBAR to overcome this condition by invoking the MFN clause, which coincides with the interpretation adopted by several other tribunals, amounts to a serious departure from such rule.\n\n255.\n\nThe Committee further finds that there is no failure to state reasons in the Decision on Jurisdiction because the Tribunal gave comprehensive reasons for its interpretation of the MFN clause and also addressed the arguments advanced by Respondent. While its reasoning may not be as detailed as that given by tribunals in other mentioned cases, this is not sufficient to amount to a failure to state reasons because there is no difficulty in following the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning through to its conclusion. In any event, it strongly appears from Respondent\u2019s submission that it does not really disagree with the detail of the reasoning but rather with its contents. However, even if Respondent may not be satisfied with the Tribunal\u2019s findings on Respondent\u2019s arguments, any such disagreement is irrelevant at this point and does not permit Respondent to seek annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\n256.\n\nAs regards Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal failed to consider evidence on Argentina\u2019s *subsequent* treaty practice, it appears to the Committee that such evidence was apparently not put before the Tribunal by the Parties. In particular, the submission in the jurisdictional phase of the arbitration that Respondent now invokes explicitly referred to treaties signed by Argentina and Spain *\"previous to the BIT under analysis.\"249*\n\n**Exhibit A RA 74, \u00b6** 142.\n\n257.\n\nIn respect of subsequent treaty practice, the Committee is aware that in its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Respondent also relied on the submissions made by Spain in its role as respondent *In Maffezini v. Spain* where it took the same position as Argentina in the present case, *i.e.,* that the MFN clause in Article IV(2) does not apply to dispute settlement. Respondent argued that its own interventions in *Siemens v. Argentina* and the present case as well as Spain\u2019s interventions *In Maffezini,* which coincided in their interpretation of the 18-months requirement, *\"constitute the subsequent acts of the Parties that guide the Tribunal concerning the will of the Sovereigns on signing this Treaty\"250*\n\n**Exhibit ARA 74, \u00b6** 161.\n\n258.\n\nThe Committee notes that the tribunal in *Telef\u00f3nica v. Argentina,* which was faced with the same argument, held that the States\u2019 conduct in ICSID proceedings qualified neither as a *\"subsequent agreement\"* between the Contracting States within the meaning of Article 31 (3)(a) of the Vienna Convention nor as *\" subsequent practice\"* in applying the Treaty under Article 31(3)(b) of the same Convention. In particular as regards the latter, the *Telef\u00f3nica* tribunal was *\"not convinced that positions on interpretation of a treaty provision, expressed by a Contracting State in its defensive brief in an international direct arbitration initiated against it by an investor of her other Contracting State, amounts to* \u2018practice\u2019 *of that State, as this requirement is understood in public international law, nor does it appear relevant in order to ascertain* \u2018how the treaty has been interpreted in practice\u2019 *by the parties thereto\"251* The Committee agrees with this finding and, while the Tribunal in the present case may not have explicitly explained why it considered the submissions made by Spain and Argentina in the mentioned ICSID cases not to be relevant, this does not amount to a failure to consider *relevant* evidence and thus cannot be qualified as a failure to state reasons on an outcome-determinative point.\n\n**A/CLA-37, \u00b6** 112.\n\n259.\n\nApart from Respondent\u2019s reference to the positions taken by the two States as respondents in ICSID proceedings, Respondent has not pointed to any evidence it submitted regarding the intentions of the States in entering the Treaty nor regarding their subsequent practice in the context of other bilateral investment treaties.\n\n260.\n\nIt is not entirely clear to the Committee whether Respondent suggests that the Tribunal should have investigated on its own motion subsequent treaties entered into by Argentina; in any event, the Committee agrees with Claimants that it cannot be for the Tribunal to investigate evidence not placed before it by the Parties. In line with the generally accepted principle of *\"who asserts must prove,\"* which is reflected in several provisions of the ICSID Convention, it is for the parties to present their case, including evidence to prove what they assert.252 Consequently, it would have been for Respondent to prove its assertion that subsequent treaty practice confirms its interpretation of Article X(3). In the absence of any evidence submitted in respect of such subsequent practice, there was no failure on the part of the Tribunal to consider such evidence and to state the reasons for its conclusions.\n\n*Cf.* **AL A RA 84 / A/CLA-69, \u00b6 215.**\n\n**c. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n261.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee finds that the Tribunal\u2019s decision to allow the Claimant AGBAR to override the procedural requirement in Article X(3) of the Argentina-Spain BIT by virtue of the MFN clause in Article IV(2) does not amount to either a manifest excess of powers, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure or a failure to state reasons. Consequently, the second annulment ground advanced by Respondent is dismissed.\n\n**C. Third Set of Grounds for Annulment Relating to the State of Necessity under Customary International Law**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nRespondent submits that, by rejecting Argentina\u2019s state of necessity defense without stating the legal standards to be met under the *\"only way\"* and the *\"non-contribution\"* requirements that it considered not fulfilled and by not taking into account the evidence presented by Respondent in this regard, the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its decision (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention). Respondent notes that this, together with a finding of an excess of powers, was precisely the grounds on which the *Enron* committee decided to annul the award.253\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, **\u00b6\u00b6** 43-47; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, **\u00b6** 123 referring to **AL A RA 33, \u00b6\u00b6** 385-395; Argentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6\u00b6** 131-132, 146-147.\n\n263.\n\nRespondent argues that, contrary to Claimants\u2019 submission, the Tribunal should have established the legal standards applicable to both the *\"only way\"* and the *\"non-contribution\"* requirements before concluding that these requirements had not been met, but failed to do so in its Decision on Liability.254\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 136-139.\n\n264.\n\nRespondent refers to the finding of the **Enron** committee that the non-contribution requirement *\"is potentially capable of more than one interpretation\"* and that the tribunal in that case *\"was necessarily required, either expressly or* sub silentio, *to decide or assume the correct interpretation in order to apply the provision to the facts of the case\"* More specifically, the **Enron** committee considered that the tribunal should have asked the question whether the conduct of the State would have had to be *\"deliberate,\" \"reckless or negligent\"* or *\"some even lesser degree of fault\"* in order to qualify as a contribution to the situation.255 Respondent notes that it submitted to the Tribunal the question to be assessed, *i.e., \"whether Argentina has contributed to (thereby provoking) the crisis in such a way so as to make it unjust to invoke the doctrine of necessity\";* however, the Tribunal did not address this concern or the legal standard that it would later apply to the facts.256\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 124; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 142 quoting from **AL A RA 33, \u00b6\u00b6** 386, 389.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 125-126 quoting from its Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 777; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 143-144.\n\n265.\n\nSimilarly, Respondent argues that the *\"only way\"* requirement is capable of differing interpretations and therefore had to be addressed by the Tribunal before applying the facts to it. Respondent refers to its submission on the possible interpretations before the Tribunal as well as to the questions raised by the *Enron* committee relating to: (i) the legal definition; (ii) the relevance of the relative effectiveness of alternative measures; and (iii) who was to make a decision on relevant alternatives and in accordance with what test.257\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 127 quoting from its Post-Hearing Memorial, \u00b6 764; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 140 quoting from **AL A RA 33, \u00b6\u00b6** 369-372.\n\n266.\n\nRespondent further refers to the findings of the *Enron* committee that the tribunal in that case had not in fact applied the legal elements of the requirement in Article 25(2)(b) of the Draft Articles of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts adopted by the International Law Commission (the **\"ILC Draft Articles\")** to the facts but had rather applied an expert opinion on this issue and therefore had failed to apply the applicable law, which constituted a ground for annulment.258 In Respondent\u2019s view, the Tribunal\u2019s failure in the present case is even more serious because it failed to follow the first two of the three steps of reasoning indicated by the *Enron* committee (finding the relevant facts; applying the legal elements to the facts; concluding whether or not the requirements under Article 25 were met) and went directly to the third - making it impossible to follow the Tribunal to its conclusion.259\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 128 quoting from **AL A RA 33, \u00b6** 392.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 129; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 133-134, 159-160.\n\n267.\n\nRespondent further notes that the Tribunal did recognize the influence of external forces on the Argentine economy and intended to *\"show that Argentina itself contributed to its situation of emergency.\"260* Nevertheless, Respondent claims that the Tribunal ignored the evidence submitted by Argentina in support of its submissions on the origins of the crisis and in response to Claimants\u2019 arguments: a witness statement, three expert reports (and two rebuttal/supplemental reports) as well as documentary evidence. Claimants, on the other hand, did not provide any economic or social export report. Respondent further refers to the *amicus curiae* brief filed by five non-governmental organization in relation the human right to water that Respondent had raised in this context.261\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 130.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, 121-122 referring to **Exhibits R TE-6, R TE-7, R TE-8, R-TE 21, R-TE 22** and **R-TE 23;** Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 149.\n\n268.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the *\"only way\"* requirement, Respondent invokes an *\"absolute failure\"* on the part of the Tribunal to address Respondent\u2019s evidence that the measures Argentina adopted during the crisis were, as described by Prof. Roubini, *\"unavoidable\" -* without any analysis or justification. Instead, Respondent contends that the Tribunal directly accepted Claimants\u2019 submissions *\"almost copying their submissions word for word\u2019* even though such submissions were not supported by any evidence.262 According to Respondent, the same applies to the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions on the *\"non-contribution\"* requirement where the Tribunal *\"virtually copied and pasted the statements made by the Claimants,\"* while disregarding the evidence presented by Respondent, without making any reference to it.263\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 132 quoting from **Exhibit R-TE 22, \u00b6\u00b6** 28-29; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 150-152.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, 154-156 quoting from Decision on Liability, \u00b6 264 and Claimants\u2019 Reply on the Merits **(Exhibit A RA 76), \u00b6** 505.\n\n269.\n\nRespondent submits that, in line with the finding of the *TECO* committee that a tribunal *\"cannot simply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, without any analysis and without explaining why it found that evidence insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory,\"* the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the state of necessity defense does not satisfy the requirement to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.264\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, **\u00b6\u00b6** 157-158 quoting from **AL A RA 89, \u00b6** 131\n\n270.\n\nFinally, as to the invoked priority of the human right to water over investment treaties, Respondent argues that the Tribunal did not state reasons for its conclusion that *\"Argentina could have respected both types of obligations,\"* which in its view were not *\"inconsistent, contradictory, or mutually exclusive.\"265*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 133; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 161, 163 quoting from Decision on Liability, \u00b6 262.\n\n**2. Summary of Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nClaimants submit that the Tribunal stated its reasons for rejecting Respondent\u2019s state of necessity defense, and did so *\"comprehensively and in full consideration of the elements of the defense\"* under Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles. Claimants emphasize that this defense is exceptional under international law because it excuses a State from conduct that would otherwise be breaching its international obligations and may therefore be invoked *\"under only the most strict conditions\"* According to Claimants, the findings of fact that the Tribunal made with regard to the *\"only way\"* and *\"non-contribution\"* requirements precluded a successful necessity defense.266\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 164-165.\n\n272.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal failed to establish the legal standards to be applied to the facts, given that it is *\"evident from the decision\"* that the Tribunal interpreted the *\"only way\"* requirement *\"at face value,\" i.e.,* as a measure that is *\"the sole available response for addressing a situation of necessity,\"* which made any further elaboration unnecessary.267\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 166: Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 102.\n\n273.\n\nAs to the *\"non-contribution\"* requirement, Claimants submit that the Tribunal did explicitly state its reasons and interpreted this requirement, when it referred to the Commentary on the ILC Draft Articles pursuant to which a contribution must be *\"sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral\"* and considered it *\"an important question... whether* *Argentina contributed to the crisis of2001-2003 to an extent sufficiently substantial to rule out a necessity defense in compliance with international law.\u2019\u2019268*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 103-104 quoting from Decision on Liability, \u00b6 263.\n\n274.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s reliance on the decision of the *Enron* committee, Claimants points out that this decision was *\"widely criticized\u2019* and moreover did not annul the award on the basis of a failure to state reasons but rather based on *\"the questionable theory that the tribunal had exceeded its power by not applying what the committee in Enron considered to be the correct interpretation of Article 25 of the ILC Articles\"269*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 167 referring to **AL A RA 33, \u00b6** 393; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 105.\n\n275.\n\nClaimants argue that Respondent\u2019s real objective to reargue the merits is displayed in a passage from its Memorial where it stated that *\"the Tribunal did not follow the reasoning indicated by the annulment committee in Enron, so the Award in this case should be [annulled] along the same lines as that of Enron\"* In Claimants\u2019 view, declining to follow the reasoning of the *Enron* committee cannot be considered a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.270\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, **\u00b6\u00b6** 168-169 quoting from Argentina\u2019s Memorial, **\u00b6** 129.\n\n276.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal disregarded the evidence presented by Argentina, Claimants refer to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that it was *\"not persuaded\u2019* by Argentina\u2019s claim that *\"there was nothing else it could have done\"271* Claimants submit that the *El Paso* committee rejected *\"virtually identical arguments\"* from Argentina when stating that *\"[t]he assessment of the evidence and interpretation of the applicable law must be performed only by the Tribunal, not by the Committee*.\" The committee further held that *\"it is not an appeal tribunal and therefore cannot or should not decide whether evidence was well or ill-considered or not considered at all by the Tribunal. Rule 34(1) of the Arbitration Rules is clear when it indicates that the tribunal alone is empowered to decide on two fundamental issues related to the allegation of Argentina: the admissibility of evidence and its probative value.\u2019\u2019272*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 107 quoting from Decision on Liability, \u00b6 235.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 107 quoting from **AL A RA 35, \u00b6\u00b6** 191, 196.\n\n277.\n\nIn any event, Claimants contend that the Tribunal did weigh the evidence submitted in relation to the *\"only way\"* requirement, as evidenced by its finding that *\"[t]here is strong* *evidence that Argentina might have employed more flexible means that would have protected both its interests and those of the Claimants\"273*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 109 quoting from Decision on Liability, \u00b6 235.\n\n278.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, this and other similar findings show that the Tribunal considered and rejected Respondent\u2019s suggestion that there were *\"no alternative measures\"* it could have taken; as the Tribunal reached a reasoned conclusion that can be followed through by the reader, it was not required under the ICSID Convention to review and discuss every exhibit and argument presented in the pleadings.274\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 110.\n\n279.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal copied the submissions made in Claimants\u2019 Reply on the Merits and add that their submissions were in fact supported by *\"extensive evidence\"* relating to the contribution of Argentina to the economic crisis. In addition, Claimants note that the Tribunal found that *\"a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors contributed to the Argentine crisis,\"* which demonstrates that it did consider the evidence before it.275\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 111-112.\n\n280.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s reliance on the approach applied by the *TECO* committee, Claimants argue that this decision is *\"clearly distinguishable\"* from the case at hand because the committee there *\"struggled to understand the Tribunal\u2019s line of reasoning,\"* given the tribunal\u2019s finding that there was no evidence on certain points even though the parties had in fact placed such evidence on the record. By contrast, Claimants consider the reasoning of the Tribunal in the present case *\"straightforward and easy to follow\"* and, in addition, emphasize that Respondent itself acknowledged its own contribution to the crisis when stating that the situation was *\"mainly\"* generated by external factors. In Claimants\u2019 view, this concession meant that Respondent simply could not satisfy the *\"non-contribution\"* requirement as interpreted by the Tribunal.276\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 113-115 quoting from **ALARA 89,** 128 and Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder Memorial **(Exhibit A/C-47**  \u00b6 1101.\n\n281.\n\nSimilarly, Claimants contend that in the underlying arbitration Respondent made purely legal arguments in relation to the *\"only way\"* requirement and did not present evidence that would have satisfied the legal standard ultimately adopted by the Tribunal; thus, when the Tribunal decided not to follow Respondent\u2019s legal argument, there was no relevant evidence from Respondent to be considered by the Tribunal.277\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118.\n\n282.\n\nFinally, Claimants reject Respondent\u2019s submission that the Tribunal rejected its invocation of the human right to water without giving reasons for its decision. Claimants refer to the findings of the Tribunal that Respondent could not invoke one obligation as an excuse for not fulfilling the other and, in addition, that Respondent could have respected both obligations. As to the second conclusion, Claimants contend that the Tribunal\u2019s reasons are *\"implicit in the Tribunal\u2019s finding that Argentina had alternative means to address the alleged situation of necessity (and thus protect the human right to water) without violating the Claimants\u2019 treaty rights.\"278*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 119.\n\n**3. Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n283.\n\nAs regards the Tribunal\u2019s decision to reject Respondent\u2019s necessity defense, Respondent advances one annulment ground, *i.e.,* that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which its decision is based (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention). In this context, Respondent argues that: (i) the Tribunal failed to establish the applicable legal standards to be met in order to satisfy the requirements of Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles, in particular the *\"only way\"* and *\"non-contribution\"* requirements; and (ii) the Tribunal failed to address the evidence submitted by Respondent in support of its submissions. In addition, Respondent claims that the Tribunal has failed to state reasons for its conclusion that Argentina could have complied with both the BIT and its human rights obligations.\n\n**a. The Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n------------------------------\n\n284.\n\nIn its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal acknowledged that Argentina was facing *\"one of the most severe* [crises] *in its history\"* at the time it adopted the measures the Tribunal found to be in violation of the Treaty but emphasized that this fact alone did not allow the State to invoke the plea of necessity. The Tribunal noted that in line with the exceptional nature of this defense, additional strict conditions were imposed by Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles in order to avoid the possibility that the State can simply escape from its treaty obligations whenever a crisis occurs.279\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 257-258.\n\n285.\n\nThe Tribunal then analyzed each of the four requirements set out in Article 25. As to the first requirement in Article 25(1)(a), *i.e.,* that the measures adopted by Argentina were *\"the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril,\"* the Tribunal was not satisfied that this requirement was met. It held:\n\n*\"The provision of water and sewage services to the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires certainly was vital to the health and well-being of nearly ten million people and was therefore an essential interest of the Argentine State. On the other hand, the Tribunal is not convinced that the only way that Argentina could satisfy that essential interest was by adopting measures that would subsequently violate the treaty rights of the Claimants\u2019 investments to fair and equitable treatment. As discussed above, Argentina could have attempted to apply more flexible means to assure the continuation of the water and sewage services to the people of Buenos Aires and at the same time respected its obligations of fair and equitable treatment. The two were by no means mutually exclusive. Thus the Tribunalfinds that Argentina has not satisfied the first condition for the defense of necessity.\"280*\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 260. It was established during the hearing that the phrase \"[a|.s *discussed above\"* refers to paragraph 235, which reads:  \n*\"Moreover, there is strong evidence that Argentina might have employed more flexible means that would have protected both its interests and those of the Claimants. For example, if Argentina\u2019s concern was to avoid an increase in tariffs during a time of crisis, it might have relieved AASA, at least temporarily, of investment commitments that were placing a crippling burden on the Concession so long as tariffs did not increase. If Argentina\u2019s concern was to protect the poor from increased tariffs, it might have allowed tariff increases for other consumers while applying a social tariff or a subsidy to the poor, a solution clearly permitted by the regulatory framework. There is evidence that governmental agencies were among the consumers with the largest unpaid invoices owing to AASA. Argentina might have taken measures to assure that its own governmental organizations paid their legitimate debts to AASA. All of these options were suggested to the Argentine authorities and all were rejected. In short, there appears to have been very little desire or effort after the outbreak of the crisis for Argentina to* \u2018work together\u2019 *with AASA and the Claimants. Once the crisis had ended and economic growth returned to the Argentine economy, the government showed no greater willingness to find a way to work together with AASA and the Claimants. While Argentina seems to suggest that there was nothing else that it could have done in its relationship with AASA and the Claimants, the Tribunal is not persuaded that an amicable solution could not have been reached.\"*\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal then analyzed the second and third requirements under Articles 25(1)(b) and 25(2)(a), *i.e.,* that the adopted measure did *\"not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole\"* and that *\"[t]he international obligation in question* [does not] *exclude the possibility of invoking necessity\",* and found that these requirements were both met.281\n\nDecision on Liability, **\u00b6\u00b6** 259-262.\n\n287.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal assessed the fourth requirement under Article 25(2)(b), *i.e.,* that *\"[t]he State has* [not] *contributed to the situation of necessity\"* and concluded that it was not satisfied in the present case. It reasoned:\n\n*\"To invoke the defense of necessity, a state must not have contributed to its situation of necessity. The operative word of this condition is* \u2018contribute\u2019, *not* \u2018cause\u2019 *or* \u2018create.\u2019 *Thus, the fact that other actors, besides the state in question, may have contributed to that state\u2019s situation of necessity does not automatically mean that such state has not contributed to it. The Commentary to the ILC Articles makes it clear that such contribution must* \u2018...be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral.\u2019 *Thus, an important question is whether Argentina contributed to the crisis of 2001-2003 to an extent sufficiently substantial to rule out a necessity defense in compliance with international law. This being said, the Claimants in their pleadings viewed the crisis as created primarily by endogamous factors, primarily the economic policies of various Argentine governments. The Respondent, on the other hand, portrayed the crisis as caused by exogenous factors, primarily the various global crises, such as the one which struck Russia in 1999.*\n\n*The Tribunal finds that a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors contributed to the Argentine crisis at the beginning of this century.* *Among Argentina\u2019s contributing factors to the crisis were excessive public spending, inefficient tax collection, delays in responding to the early signs of the crisis, insufficient efforts at developing an export market, and internal political dissension and problems inhibiting effective policy making. In listing these factors, the Tribunal does not by any means intend to minimize the substantial external forces that were buffeting the Argentine economy. Its intent is to show that Argentina itself contributed to its situation of emergency. In this regard, this Tribunal must agree with the tribunal in* CMS v. Argentina, *which stated that* \u2018[t]he issue, however, is whether the contribution to the crisis by Argentina has or has not been sufficiently substantial. The Tribunal, when reviewing the circumstances of present dispute, must conclude that this was the case. The crisis was not of the making of one particular administration and found its roots in the earlier crisis of the 1980s and evolving governmental policies of the 1990s that reached a zenith in 2002 and thereafter. Therefore, the Tribunal observes that government policies and their shortcomings significantly contributed to the crisis and the emergency and while exogenous factors did fuel additional difficulties they do not exempt the Respondent from its responsibility in the matter.\u2019 *One might also suggest if external, global factors alone had created Argentina\u2019s crisis, it is surprising that other countries did not experience a crisis of equal magnitude at the time.\"282*\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 263-264.\n\n288.\n\nBased on its findings that two out of the four requirements under Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles were not met because: (i) the measures adopted by Argentina were not the *\"only* *way\"* to satisfy its essential interests; and (ii) Argentina itself *\"contributed'* to the emergency situation it was facing in 2001 to 2003, the Tribunal denied Respondent\u2019s necessity defense.283\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 265.\n\n**b. The Committee\u2019s Considerations on the Tribunal\u2019s Findings**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nAt the outset, the Committee notes that there is agreement between the Parties regarding the applicability of Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of Respondent\u2019s necessity defense.284 It is disputed, however, whether the Tribunal would have been required to: (i) interpret the requirements of Article 25 in terms of establishing more concrete legal standards, in particular as regards the *\"only way\"* and *\"contribution\"* requirements; and (ii) address the evidence advanced by Respondent in support of its position, before concluding that these requirements were not met.\n\nThere was a slight doubt as to this continuing agreement as Respondent stated during the hearing \" *...that doesn \u2019t mean that this draft Article is binding in its entirety as drafted.\"* However, Respondent made no further submissions in this regard and, immediately following this statement, returned to its argument that the Tribunal would have been required to determine *\"what was the legal standard applicable under customary international law in respect to each of these requirements* [under Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles].\" Transcript (Day 1), p. 70 lines 20 -22, p. 71 lines 2-4.\n\n**i. The Tribunal\u2019s Alleged Failure to Establish the Legal Standards**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s first argument that the Tribunal in this case failed to identify the legal standards to be met in order to satisfy both the *\"only way\"* and the *\"non-contribution\"* requirements under Article 25, the Committee agrees with Respondent and with the committee in *Enron v. Argentina* on whose decision Respondent relies, that both requirements are indeed susceptible to a certain degree of interpretation.\n\n291.\n\nIt is further true that the Tribunal did not explicitly identify the interpretation it adopted. However, the Committee notes that Respondent has not pointed to any submissions made by the Parties on this point in the underlying proceedings. In this regard, it is not entirely clear to the Committee whether the *Enron* committee considered similar circumstances a ground for annulment, as suggested by Respondent,285 and thus took the position that a tribunal fails to apply the applicable law and to state sufficient reasons for its decision if it fails to address possible different interpretations of a legal provision even when such interpretation was not subject to a debate between the parties.286 In any event, this Committee firmly confirms its view that it is not for a tribunal to establish the issues to be decided, and that an interpretation issue that was not raised by the Parties cannot be considered *\"outcome-determinative\"* with the consequence that a failure to address such issue would amount to a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) or to a failure to state reasons under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n*Cf* Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 141\n\n*Cf.* **AL A RA 33, \u00b6\u00b6** 375-376.\n\n292.\n\nThe Committee further agrees with the committee in *Impregiio v. Argentina* that *\"the failure to fully conceptualize the content of a standard is not a ground for annulment of an award.\"287* In addition, the Committee recalls its finding above that an *ad hoc* committee should undertake reasonable efforts to follow the reasons given by the tribunal. In the present context, this means that it is sufficient if the Committee can reasonably infer the interpretation adopted by the Tribunal from its reasoning.\n\n**A/CLA-42 / AL A RA 34, \u00b6 158.**\n\n293.\n\nAs to the *\"only way\"* requirement, the Tribunal found that *\"Argentina could have attempted to apply more flexible means\"* to satisfy the essential interest in question and *\"at the same time respected its obligations offair and equitable treatment\"* The Tribunal further referred to a discussion in the context of its analysis on whether Respondent accorded fair and equitable treatment to Claimants, where it stated, *inter alia,* that such flexible means could have *\"protected both its interests and those of the Claimants\"* and that contrary to Respondent\u2019s allegation, it was not persuaded that an amicable solution could not have been reached.288\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 260, 235.\n\n294.\n\nAs to the *\"non-contribution\"* requirement, the Tribunal first noted that the term *\"contributed\u2019* does not automatically exclude the possibility that more than one actor contributed to the state of necessity. It then referred to the Commentary to the ILC Draft Articles pursuant to which the contribution of the State must *\"be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral\"* The Tribunal thus held that it had to assess *\"whether Argentina contributed to the crisis of2001-2003 to an extent sufficiently substantial to rule out a necessity defense in compliance with international law.\u2019\u2019289*\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 263.\n\n295.\n\nRegardless of the merits of the interpretation adopted by the Tribunal, which is not for this Committee to re-consider, the Committee is of the view that the Tribunal thereby sufficiently established the standard it was going to apply to the facts of the case.\n\n296.\n\nConsequently, Respondent\u2019s first argument that the Tribunal failed to state the legal standards it was going to apply to assess Respondent\u2019s necessity defense is dismissed.\n\n**ii. The Tribunal\u2019s Alleged Failure to Consider Relevant Evidence**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nWith regard to Respondent\u2019s second argument that the Tribunal failed to address relevant evidence Respondent filed in support of its submissions, the Committee notes that Respondent heavily relied on what the *Enron* committee considered to be the requirements for a proper analysis of Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles. However, while the *Enron* committee placed great emphasis on its finding that the tribunal had directly accepted the conclusions of an economic expert opinion rather than applying the legal requirements of Article 25 to the facts of the case,290 Respondent\u2019s argument in the present case is a different one.\n\n**AL A RA 33, \u00b6\u00b6** 376-377, \u00b6 393.\n\n298.\n\nSpecifically with regard to the consideration of evidence, Respondent further relies on the finding made by the *TECO* committee that a tribunal cannot *\"simply gloss over evidence upon which the Parties have placed significant emphasis, without any analysis and without explaining why it found that evidence insufficient, unpersuasive or otherwise unsatisfactory.\"291* According to Respondent, the Tribunal did exactly that because it did not even refer to any of the five expert reports (including two rebuttal/supplemental reports), the witness statement or the documentary evidence submitted by Respondent in support of its submissions on the origins of the crisis and the unavoidability of the measures it adopted; likewise, the Tribunal failed to consider the *amicus curiae* brief filed by five nongovernmental organizations.\n\n**ALARA 89, \u00b6** 131.\n\n299.\n\nAt this point, the Committee first wishes to reiterate that it is not for an *ad hoc* committee to re-consider the evidence put before the Tribunal nor to determine whether the Tribunal assessed each and every piece of evidence that the Parties considered relevant to their case. As noted above, the *TECO* committee did not call this general principle into question but rather had to deal with an exceptional case, *i.e., \"the complete absence of any discussion of the Parties\u2019 expert reports within the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the loss of value claim\"292*\n\n**ALARA 89, \u00b6** 131.\n\n300.\n\nContrary to the *TECO* case, the Tribunal in the present case did not consider that there was *\"no sufficient evidence\"* for a certain issue, without specifying why the expert reports submitted by the parties did not qualify as such evidence.293 It can rather be reasonably inferred from the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning that it did consider the evidence before it and reached its conclusions on that evidentiary basis, albeit without discussing in detail any particular item filed by either Party.\n\n*Cf.* **AL A RA 89, \u00b6** 130.\n\n301.\n\nClaimants correctly pointed out that in its discussion about the **\"only way\"** requirement, the Tribunal made reference to an earlier discussion in the context of the FET standard on possible alternative means that Argentina could have employed without violating its obligations under the Treaty. In that context, the Tribunal referred to *\"strong evidence\"* that Respondent could have applied more flexible means that would have protected the interests of both sides.294 The Tribunal\u2019s subsequent discussion of possible alternative means that Respondent could have employed demonstrates that the Tribunal did take the contents of the evidence as well as of the *amicus curiae* brief into account. Its subsequent finding that Argentina\u2019s measures were not the **\"only way\"** in which Respondent could have acted complemented its earlier finding on the FET violation.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 260 referring to \u00b6 235.\n\n302.\n\nIn the context of the *\"non-contribution\"* requirement, the Tribunal further held that *\"a combination of endogenous and exogenous factors contributed to the Argentine crisis\"* and explicitly acknowledged the *\"substantial external forces that were buffeting the Argentine economy\"* at the time.295 This demonstrates that the Tribunal did not, as alleged by Respondent, simply adopt Claimants\u2019 submissions but rather took the arguments advanced by Respondent and its experts into account.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 264.\n\n303.\n\nIn addition, the Committee concurs with the finding of the *TECO* committee that a tribunal can be required to address certain pieces of evidence only to the extent that they are deemed *\"highly relevant.\"* In the Committee\u2019s view, this means that such evidence must have the potential to have an impact on the outcome of the Award. This is not the case here to the extent that Respondent and its experts acknowledged that the Argentine State contributed to the crisis. In this regard, Claimants correctly pointed to Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder on the Merits where it stated:\n\n*\"Claimants state that Argentina describes the crisis suffered as a purely external fact. That is not true. Argentina argues, on the other hand, that this is a situation generated mainly by externalfactors, which was followed by an impossibility to maintain the prevailing economic policy in a new macroeconomic scenario \"296*\n\n**Exhibit A/C-47A \u00b6** 1101\n\n304.\n\nRespondent\u2019s experts Profs. Mario Damill and Roberto Frenkel stated in their expert report:\n\n*\"The successive fiscal efforts made allowed for a significant improvement in the primary result of public accounts (that is, an improvement in the result, without taking into account the payments of interest on the public debt.) Even so, those efforts were partly unsuccessful and partly counterproductive. They were unsuccessful because the rise in interest rates on public debt associated with the adverse change in the external financial scenario substantially* \u2018absorbed\u2019 *income obtained on account of successive measures designed to reduce primary public expenditure (without taking interest into account) and increase taxes. They were counterproductive because, in reducing the aggregate demand, such actions contributed to the consolidation of the recession, and thus fed the adverse expectations of economic agents regarding the future course of the economy. This, in turn, fed again the perception of risk and, as a consequence, the rises in interest rates. This clear vicious circle rendered fiscal policy useless and led to a worsening situation\"297*\n\n**Exhibit R-TE-21, \u00b6 28.**\n\n305.\n\nDuring the hearing on the merits, Respondent\u2019s witness Mr. Eduardo A. Ratti was presented with a list of endogenous causes of the crisis in Argentina as alleged by Claimants and was asked whether he agreed that *\"amongst other things, they were causes of the Argentine crisis\"* Mr. Ratti responded: *\"Causes and effects? Yes, yes, I share that point of view. I think it\u2019s not just that, but I think that\u2014those are among them\"298*\n\nRespondent\u2019s opening presentation, slide 104 reproducing a quote of the hearing transcript in Argentina\u2019s Post-Hearing Brief on the Merits, \u00b6 775.\n\n306.\n\nIn light of these statements, it is apparent to the Committee that the question for the Tribunal to assess was whether the acknowledged endogenous factors amounted to a *\"significant\"* contribution within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) and thus excluded the state of necessity defense. This, however, is a legal assessment on which neither of the economic expert reports could opine. In fact, if the Tribunal had looked for guidance on this legal question in any of the expert reports, it could have been found to have committed the same annullable error that the *Enron* committee found, *i.e.,* deference to an economic expert report where the tribunal should have made its own legal assessment of a requirement under international law.\n\n307.\n\nConsequently, the Committee cannot follow Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal committed the same, or even a more serious, error that the *Enron* tribunal was found to have made. To the contrary, the Tribunal made its own assessment of the evidence put before it, which is not to be re-evaluated by this Committee, and applied the legal requirements of Article 25 to the facts as found by it.\n\n308.\n\nFinally, the Committee does not agree with Respondent that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its conclusion that Argentina could have respected both its Treaty and its human rights obligations and in that context failed to give sufficient weight to the *amicus curiae* brief filed by five non-governmental organizations in 2007. Besides explicitly mentioning the ***amicus curiae*** brief and its contents in its reasoning on the requirements of Article 25,299 the Tribunal referred in its reasoning to more flexible means that either did not include a tariff increase at all or at least for the poor part of the population, *i.e.,* it addressed the concerns raised in the ***amicus curiae*** brief.300 In addition, the Tribunal expressly considered and dismissed the suggestion made in Respondent\u2019s submissions and the ***amicus curiae*** brief that Argentina\u2019s human rights obligations somehow trumped its obligations under the BIT.301\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 256, 262.\n\n*Cf.* Decision on Liability, \u00b6 235.\n\n*Cf.* Decision on Liability, \u00b6 262.\n\n309.\n\nConsequently, Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal failed to make its own assessment of the facts based on the evidence presented by the Parties and to apply the legal elements of Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles to these facts is dismissed.\n\n**c. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n310.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not fail to state the reasons for its decision to deny Respondent\u2019s necessity defense and therefore Respondent\u2019s third ground for annulment is dismissed.\n\n**D. Fourth Set of Grounds for Annulment Relating to the Valuation of Damages**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. Summary of Respondent\u2019s Position**\n---------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nRespondent submits that in determining Claimants\u2019 alleged losses pursuant to its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention) and failed to state the reasons for its decision (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention) in connection with: (i) the valuation period; (ii) the construction of the valuation exercise; and (iii) the management fees.302\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, **\u00b6** 48; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 136.\n\n312.\n\nRespondent claims that the contradictions in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning render it *\"impossible for any reader to understand or even find the rationale of the Award\"* in connection with a *\"pivotal or outcome-determinative point\"* According to Respondent, the two elements justifying the annulment of the Award for a failure to state reasons, *i.e.,* (i) a lack of rationale for a particular point of the decision, which is (ii) necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision, are therefore fulfilled. In addition, Respondent contends that annulment is also warranted based on the Tribunal\u2019s application of legislation that was inapplicable to this case and its ruling on issues over which it did not have jurisdiction, which amounts to a manifest excess of powers.303\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 139-140; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 172.\n\n**a. Compensation for the Effects of a Measure that Did Not Violate the BITs**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nAs to the valuation period, Respondent claims that the Tribunal held that the damages awarded to Claimants should include losses that were allegedly incurred after the termination of the Concession Contract in 2006 up to the end of the concession period in 2023 - despite the fact that it had ruled in its Decision on Liability that the record was insufficient to establish that the termination amounted to a violation of the FET standard.304 According to Respondent, the Tribunal\u2019s finding, together with its statement that damages may only be awarded for harm caused by internationally wrongful acts, would have necessarily resulted in the valuation period ending together with the termination of the Concession Contract, *i.e.,* in 2006.305\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6\u00b6 49-51 referring to Decision on Liability, \u00b6 246 and Award, \u00b6 97; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 142; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 168-169 quoting from Decision on Liability, \u00b6 246.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, 52 referring to Award, \u00b6 26; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 149; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 170-171.\n\n314.\n\nRespondent argues that the contradiction lies in the fact that the Tribunal removed the termination of the Concession Contract from the **\"without measures\"** scenario, by which it intended to determine *\"the value of the investment in the hypothetical situation where Argentina did not take measures that violated its treaty obligations\"* In Respondent\u2019s view, however, the Tribunal should have taken into account the termination in both the actual and the **\"without measures\"** scenario and thereby should have assessed the damages until 2006 rather than until 2023.306 Respondent emphasizes that the Tribunal even recognized that the risk of termination was always present in the concession and claims that this makes the contradiction in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning *\"even more evident\"307*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 144-146 quoting from Award, \u00b6 28; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 176.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 171.\n\n315.\n\nRespondent refers to the example given by the Tribunal in this context, *i.e.,* that one would value a house lost in a fire based on the market value just before the fire\u2019s occurrence rather than after the fire, and its conclusion that, likewise, the Tribunal had to start its valuation of Claimants\u2019 losses at a point before Respondent\u2019s Treaty breaches took place. According to Respondent, this demonstrates the Tribunal\u2019s excess of power because, in the example, there was a link between the measure giving rise to liability, **i.e.,** the fire, and the injury sustained, **i.e.,** the loss of value of the house; in the present case, however, the termination was not found to be a measure giving rise to liability under the BIT but the Tribunal nevertheless placed the burden of bearing the consequences of the termination on Respondent.308\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 173-175 quoting from Award, \u00b6 36.\n\n316.\n\nRespondent emphasizes that it does not disagree with the valuation date or the valuation methodology as Claimants allege but rather with the fact that Respondent is requested to pay compensation for a period during which there was no longer a contract in force - without the termination having been found to violate the BIT.309\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 178-179.\n\n317.\n\nIn Respondent\u2019s view, by awarding damages for the time period after the termination, the Tribunal exceeded the framework of its Decisions on Jurisdiction and on Liability, under which it was to assess the damages, and awarded damages for a lawful act. Respondent claims that this constitutes a manifest excess of powers and a failure to state reasons - in the form of stating contradictory reasons.310\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, 54; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 151-154; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 181-182.\n\n318.\n\nIn addition, Respondent takes the view that all cash flows, both prior to and after the termination, belong to AASA rather than its shareholders and should therefore be subject to discussion in the Argentine courts, in accordance with the forum selection clause agreed upon in the Concession Contract, given the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the termination took place in accordance with the Concession Contract; that it did not have jurisdiction over that matter; and that there was no evidence that the termination amounted to a violation of the BIT.311 In this regard, Respondent emphasizes that Claimants have also brought an action in the Argentine courts for *\"the same items that they claim in this dispute\"312*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 169, 176.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 148.\n\n**b. Methodology and Calculation of Damages**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n319.\n\nAs to the construction of the valuation exercise, Respondent claims that the Tribunal: (i) based its calculation of damages on Resolution ETOSS No. 602/99 dated 8 July 1999 **(\"Resolution 602/99\") -** a rule it had earlier deemed not to be part of the applicable regulatory framework; and (ii) applied a series of regulatory/legal presumptions, which are not even based on Resolution 602/99 nor on the applicable legal framework - without providing any reasons and in contradiction to other statements it had made.313\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 183; Argentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6 55.\n\n320.\n\nRespondent refers in particular to the Tribunal\u2019s assumption of a liquidity relief, *i.e.,* an interest-free loan of Argentina to AASA in the amount of ARS 132 million, which Respondent considers to be incompatible with the applicable legal framework and which was not considered or suggested by the Parties. Respondent argues that it was under no obligation to grant such a loan to AASA and considers this assumption contradictory, in particular taking into account that Argentina was experiencing one of the most severe crises in its history.314\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, 55-56; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 170.\n\n321.\n\nRespondent further considers it contradictory that the Tribunal assumed in its Award that: (i) profits were guaranteed allowing for a continuous repayment of debt; and (ii) AASA had a guarantee ensuring the achievement of financial equilibrium, even though the Tribunal had held in its Decision on Liability that the expression *\"equilibriumprinciple\"* was nowhere to be found in the Water Decree and that *\"[t]he Concession is based on the principle of business risk,\"* expressly including financial risk.315\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6 56 quoting from Decision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 125 and 106.\n\n322.\n\nAccording to Respondent, by assuming as a premise that AASA should be a viable company, the Tribunal ignored the law that it deemed applicable, **i.e.,** the Concession Contract, and applied legislation that it did not mention as part of the applicable legal framework in its Decision on Liability, **i.e.,** Resolution 602/99, and thereby manifestly exceeded its powers and failed to state the reasons for its decision.316 As regards the Tribunal\u2019s statement referred to by Claimants that Resolution 602/99 best reflected Argentina\u2019s obligation in a but-for scenario, Respondent argues that even the discretion of the Tribunal *\"could never entitle* [it] *to calculate damages based on a rule that it expressly excludedfrom the applicable law\"317*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6 57; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 136, 155-157.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 186.\n\n323.\n\nRespondent argues that the difference between the legal framework identified by the Tribunal in its Decision on Liability and Resolution 602/99 applied in its Award *\"is essential, since it is directly linked to the risk and responsibilities assumed by the Concessionaire\";* while the former is based on the principle of business risk, the latter is based on the **\"Equilibrium Principle\"** invoked by Claimants, which guarantees a certain rate of return over the unamortized investments. Despite finding in its Decision on Liability that *\"the term* \u2018Equilibrium Principle\u2019 *appears nowhere in the text of the Water Decree,\"* which rather adopted a more flexible standard, Respondent claims that the Tribunal implemented the above mentioned **\"Equilibrium Principle\"** in its Award as part of the *\"without measures\"* scenario and thereby contradicted its earlier finding.318\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 158-163 quoting from Decision on Liability, \u00b6 125; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 187-191.\n\n324.\n\nRespondent submits that, as a result of the assumptions it applied, the Tribunal assumed a *\"guarantee over the projected flows repaying the total amount of the substantial debt sponsored by AASA\u2019s main shareholders,\"* which would not have been in place if the applicable legal framework had been applied. In this context, Respondent notes that, only in its Award did the Tribunal determine that the secured debt was a protected investment under the Treaty - simply by concluding that there was no evidence to the contrary. As a result, Respondent claims that the risks assumed by Claimants through their *\"policy of high indebtedness\"* were allocated in their entirety to Argentina, contrary to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the risks should be apportioned between the private investors and the State based on the principle of *\"mutual sacrifice\"319* In Respondent\u2019s view, this amounts to an *\"abusive exercise of the Tribunal\u2019s powers\"* as well as a failure to state reasons in the form of contradictory reasons.320\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 164-168, 171; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 192-194, 197.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 174.\n\n325.\n\nRespondent claims that, contrary to its expressed intention, the Tribunal did not conceive a scenario based on *\"mutual sacrifice\"* and ignored its earlier finding that the Concessionaire had to assume the Concession at its own economic and financial risk, given that the assumptions applied by the Independent Expert and adopted by the Tribunal resulted in a *\"guarantee, from a mathematical perspective,* [of] *the company\u2019s viability\"* and the entire amount of the guaranteed debt being paid by the Argentine State.321\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 196, 198.\n\n326.\n\nRespondent further argues that by building a scenario where the guaranteed debt was a protected investment under the BIT and thus intangible, the Tribunal ignored the Parties\u2019 discussions and the Independent Expert\u2019s projections on whether a potential tariff review would have made it possible to repay the total amount of guaranteed debt and rather built a scenario in which such debt was always fully covered.322According to Respondent, the assumption that the sponsored debt would be repaid entirely contradicts not only the applicable legal framework but even Resolution 602/99 because this resolution provides for a temporary tariff increase but makes no mention to an interest-free loan to cover the liquidity deficit - removing the risk of delinquency and uncollectability arising from a tariff increase - as assumed by the Tribunal.323 Respondent emphasizes that this total coverage was not even requested by Claimants and therefore manifestly exceeds the Tribunal\u2019s powers.324\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 199-200.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 169-171; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 201.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 201.\n\n327.\n\nIn addition, Respondent considers it contradictory that the Tribunal awarded compensation to AASA\u2019s shareholders as sponsors of the guaranteed debt but did not consider according the same treatment to the Argentine State, in relation to the payments it made in its capacity as guarantor of a debt incurred by AASA to the Inter-American Development Bank **(\"IDB\").** Respondent emphasizes that the Tribunal did not distinguish between the shareholder-sponsors and the National State-guarantor; thus, the situations were identical but the Tribunal nevertheless *\"applied opposing principles and conclusions\"* by placing the burden of repayment and enforcement on Respondent but not on Claimants.325\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 172; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 203.\n\n328.\n\nFinally, Respondent claims that pursuant to a proposal made by the Independent Expert, Dr. Akash Deep, the Tribunal adopted an interest rate that was *\"slightly\"* higher than the rate proposed by Claimants\u2019 experts. Respondent rejects Claimants\u2019 submission that the choice of interest rate is subject to the Tribunal\u2019s discretion and emphasizes that the Tribunal did not even refer to the rate that the Parties had agreed upon to apply as from the termination of the Concession Contract, *i.e.,* the 6-month US Treasury bill rate. Respondent claims that the Tribunal therefore acted *ultra petita* and, thus, exceeded its powers; it also seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure because it did not submit the rate to the Parties for comments.326\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 173; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 204-207.\n\n**c. Management Contract**\n--------------------------\n\n329.\n\nAs to the management fees, Respondent claims that the Tribunal awarded to Suez alleged losses incurred in relation to the Management Contract, even though it had not previously determined that this Contract was a protected investment in relation to which Respondent had violated the BIT. According to Respondent, the Tribunal would have had to state in its Decision on Jurisdiction what the protected investment is, given that this definition would then form the basis for the discussion on the merits and damages. Respondent further emphasizes that the Tribunal recognized Claimants\u2019 standing based on their shareholdings rather than on the basis of a contract for the provision of services, which was unrelated to Claimants\u2019 shareholdings.327\n\nArgentina\u2019s Application, \u00b6 58; Argentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 136, 185; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 209-211.\n\n330.\n\nIn addition, Respondent claims that the Tribunal\u2019s decision to award compensation for unpaid management fees not only between 2002 and 2006, *i.e.,* until the termination of the Concession Contract, but rather until 2023 - for services that were never provided - amounts to an abuse of the Tribunal\u2019s powers and a failure to state reasons for such conclusion, which warrants the annulment of the Award.328 Respondent argues that the Tribunal had no powers to award damages in the absence of injury, given that the management fees were found to be consideration to be given in exchange for the transfer of *\"essential, intangible assets,\" -* a transfer that no longer took place after the termination in 2006.329\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 136, 175, 186.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 212-213 quoting from Award, \u00b6 71\n\n331.\n\nIn addition, Respondent notes that the Tribunal acknowledged in its Award that *\"Dr. Deep was unsure of the legal status of the claim for Management fees\"* and argues that, nevertheless, the Tribunal did not specify such legal status and thus acted outside its jurisdiction when awarding compensation for a claim of uncertain legal status.330 In Respondent\u2019s view, Dr. Deep\u2019s report demonstrates that it would have been essential to classify the claim for management fees either as an *\"expected return\"* or as a *\"compensation for management services\"* because a classification as the former would have required amending the parameters applied in his valuation.331 Even though Dr. Deep\u2019s valuation was thus valid only for a classification as compensation for services, Respondent contends that the Tribunal, while not clearly stating its position, addressed the management fees as an expected return, given that it considered them as *\"an integral part of* [Claimants\u2019] *principal claim\"* According to Respondent, the Tribunal did not explain why it nevertheless applied Dr. Deep\u2019s parameters and contradicted its own statement that the management fees were paid *\"in consideration for the* [management-related] *obligations\"* of Suez under the Concession Contract.332\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6 176 quoting from Award, \u00b6 74; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 216.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, 177-178; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6 215 quoting from **Exhibits A/C-34 and A RA 55, \u00b6** 429.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 179-184 quoting from Award, \u00b6\u00b6 72, 75; Argentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 209, 217-218.\n\n**2. Summary of Claimants\u2019 Position**\n-------------------------------------\n\n332.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent\u2019s arguments are *\"nothing more than quarrels with the way the Tribunal assessed the evidence and applied the law\"* and a *\"disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s findings\";* they do not amount to an excess of powers nor to a failure to state reasons for the Award.333\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 115, 170.\n\n**a. Calculation of Damages to Provide Full Reparation at the Date of Respondent\u2019s Breach**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, Respondent\u2019s claim that the Tribunal awarded damages for a measure that it did not find to be a Treaty breach is a mischaracterization of how the Tribunal assessed Claimants\u2019 losses and, *\"in reality, an effort to appeal the Tribunal\u2019s decision with respect to the period over which damages should be assessed\"334* Claimants argue that Respondent does not claim that the Tribunal failed to apply the proper law, but rather that it applied such law incorrectly, which is not a basis for annulment.335\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 117.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 57.\n\n334.\n\nClaimants argue that the Tribunal did not contradictorily award damages for termination of the Concession Contract but rather for Respondent\u2019s two Treaty breaches on the dates they occurred, which preceded the termination and resulted in full reparation from that date onwards. According to Claimants, Respondent disagrees with the fact that the Tribunal\u2019s calculation did not account for events that post-dated the Treaty breaches and were thus unknown at the valuation date, such as the termination of the Concession Contract that occurred in 2006. Claimants emphasize that this point was discussed by the Parties and dealt with by the Tribunal *\"after comprehensive analysis\"336* In Claimants\u2019 view, the reasons supporting the Tribunal\u2019s findings are equally *\"clear and comprehensive\"* and do not contain any contradictions that would result in the reasons *\"cancel[ing] each other out so as to amount to no reasons at all\"337*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 118-119, 172; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 59, 121.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 170-171 quoting from **A/CLA-43, \u00b6** 77; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 123.\n\n335.\n\nClaimants refer to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that it *\"must begin its valuation of what the Claimants have lost as a result of Argentina\u2019s illegal actions* at a point in time before those actions took place,\" which meant that the Tribunal valued the investment in January 2002, *i.e.,* the date immediately before the first Treaty valuation. Claimants note that, as of that date, the Concession Contract had another 21 years to run, and again refer to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that \"[t]o *limit the valuation period to five instead of twenty-one years would, of course, seriously undervalue the investments lost as a consequence of Argentina\u2019s treaty violations.... The termination of the Concession Contract, even if not illegal under the BITs, cannot exonerate it from its obligation to repair the consequences of its wrongful act in denying fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants\u2019 investments.\"338*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 120 quoting from Award, \u00b6 36 (emphasis added by Claimants).\n\n336.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s additional argument that the Tribunal recognized that the risk of termination always existed but refused to take such risk into account, Claimants emphasize that the Tribunal in fact did refer to this risk and stated that it *\"would be accounted for in the rate applied to discount to present value the remaining twenty-one years of projected cash flows\"* According to Claimants, it is irrelevant whether the Tribunal did so correctly, as long as the reasoning is clearly set out in its Award.339\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 122 quoting from Award, \u00b6 36.\n\n337.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, Respondent disagrees with the Tribunal\u2019s findings on the valuation date and the valuation methodology; however, these fall solely within the Tribunal\u2019s powers to determine the compensation due for Respondent\u2019s breaches and cannot properly be at issue in an annulment proceeding.340\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 121.\n\n**b. Construction of the** ***\"But For'\u2019\u2019\u2019*** **Scenario**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent\u2019s arguments on the *but-for* scenario again amount to a disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s findings on the factual and legal arguments presented by the Parties. Claimants note that Respondent argued in the arbitration that Resolution 602/99 should not be applied in the *\"but for\"* scenario - an argument that was rejected by the Tribunal, which found instead that the application of Resolution 602/99 as assumed by Dr. Deep best reflected what fair and equitable treatment from the regulator would have looked like.341 Claimants quote the Tribunal\u2019s statement that *\"while Resolution 602/99 may or may not have been legally binding, it was nonetheless, as the product of an agency of the Argentine government, strong evidence of how a reasonable regulator would act in the situation that AASA and the regulators faced at the time of the Argentine crisis\"342*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 123 referring to Award, \u00b6\u00b6 51-56; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 61-64.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 64 quoting from Award, \u00b6 55.\n\n339.\n\nClaimants refer to the Tribunal\u2019s statement that the construction of a *\"but for\"* scenario *\"necessarily requires the Tribunal to enter into the realm of the hypothetical,\" i.e.,* a scenario in which *\"both Argentina and the AASA\u2019s investors would share the burden of assisting AASA through its liquidity crisis\";* while Respondent would provide some liquidity relief through a partial and temporary increase in tariffs, the shareholders would contribute additional capital, thus amounting to *\"mutual sacrifice\"343* Claimants argue that in the *\"but for\"* scenario, the Tribunal was not bound to apply the conditions prevailing in Argentina at the time but had to determine the conditions that would reasonably have prevailed if there had been a *\"productive and cooperative working relationship between the parties\"344*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 124-125; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 65 quoting from Award, \u00b6\u00b6 52-53, 55.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, 66 quoting from Award, \u00b6 43.\n\n340.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the Tribunal\u2019s approach to resort to the principles underlying Resolution 602/99 was *\"fully justified\u2019* and supported by *\"extensive reasoning\"* that was *\"explicit, straightforward, and discernable on the face of the Award\"* but, in any event, Respondent is not entitled to a *de novo* review of the assessment of the evidence and the interpretation of the law performed by the Tribunal; its disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s findings does not amount to an excess of powers nor to a failure to state reasons on the part of the Tribunal.345\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 126, 173; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68.\n\n341.\n\nClaimants further submit that Respondent\u2019s arguments relating to the secured debt were also argued before and decided by the Tribunal; however, Respondent never argued that the Tribunal did not have power to award damages in this regard but rather that any potential damages resulted from the riskiness of Claimants\u2019 investment and not from Respondent\u2019s Treaty breaches - an argument that the Tribunal rejected. Claimants emphasize that they always contended that the secured debt constituted protected investments and specifically identified their debt participation as an investment in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction - a characterization Respondent never objected to.346\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 127-128 referring to **Exhibit A/C-33, \u00b6** 8(b)(iii); Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 70.\n\n342.\n\nIn response to Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal contradicted itself by awarding Claimants compensation for extinguishing AASA\u2019s secured debt but not providing Respondent with similar relief for various sums it claims to have paid, Claimants consider this again to be disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s decision to reject Respondent\u2019s claim, the reasons for which the Tribunal gave in its Award.347\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 174 referring to Award, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.\n\n343.\n\nFinally, as to Respondent\u2019s *ultra petita* claim, Claimants contend that the interest rate proposed by the Independent Expert, *i.e.,* the 6-month Eurodollar rate, in fact yielded an interest amount lower than that sought by Claimants. In addition, Claimants submit that both Parties presented arguments on the appropriate interest rate and commented on the Independent Expert\u2019s proposal, which the Tribunal ultimately determined to more accurately place Claimants *\"in the position they would have been if no such loss had occurred.\"348* In any event, Claimants submit that while the Parties initially agreed on the US Treasury bill rate, Claimants later accepted Dr. Deep\u2019s proposal to apply the Eurodollar rate so that there was no longer any agreement on the risk-free rate when the Tribunal rendered its Award.349\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 129 quoting from Award, \u00b6 64; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 74.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 72.\n\n344.\n\nClaimants further argue that the choice of the applicable interest rate *\"falls squarely within the discretion of the Tribunal,\"* just as the choice of applicable discount rate or any other *\"damages input or even final damages figures,\"* and does not amount to an excess of powers.350\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 129; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 73.\n\n**c. Compensation for Management Fees**\n---------------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nClaimants submit that Respondent again disagrees with the Tribunal\u2019s finding on the valuation date, which resulted in a valuation of Claimants\u2019 investment, including the management fees, as of 2002, on what Claimants consider to be a *\"reasonable assumption that, had Argentina provided fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants\u2019 investment, the Concession would have continued through 2023\"* Claimants argue that on this but-for assumption, Suez would also have continued to receive management fees through 2023 and was thus entitled to damages in that amount.351\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 131; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 79.\n\n346.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal determined only in its Award that the claim for management fees was a protected investment, Claimants note that the Parties exchanged arguments on this issue, leading to the Tribunal accepting Claimants\u2019 argument that the Management Contract was *\"an integral part of the Claimants\u2019 investment\"* Claimants argue that Respondent\u2019s suggestion that a failure to define the management fees as part of Claimants\u2019 investment in the Decision on Jurisdiction would have deprived the Parties of an opportunity to fully brief the damages owed in this regard is disproven by the fact that both Parties did in fact *\"extensively\"* brief such damages in the quantum phase of the arbitration. Therefore, Claimants argue that it is irrelevant whether the Tribunal made the decision on a characterization of the management fees only in the damages phase.352\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 133; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.\n\n347.\n\nFinally, Claimants reject Respondent\u2019 argument that the Tribunal did not assign a *\"legal status\"* to the management fees, referring to the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the fees were earned though a Management Contract, which was part of Claimants\u2019 protected investment. Claimants further deny that the Tribunal misapplied Dr. Deep\u2019s alleged conclusion and note that in the paragraphs following the one quoted by Respondent, Dr. Deep in fact assumed that the management fees were a payment for services rather than a return on investment, which was *\"the precise conclusion that the Tribunal adopted when it follows Dr. Deep\u2019s approach to this issue\"353*\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 134-136.\n\n348.\n\nSpecifically, Claimants reject Respondent\u2019s submission that the Tribunal classified the management fees as an *\"expected return\"* and contend that it rather considered them to be compensation for services rendered and gave *\"detailedreasons\"* for its decision to: (i) grant Claimants\u2019 request for future management fees, albeit without interest; and (ii) reject their request for accrued but unpaid management fees.354 In addition, Claimants submit that the Tribunal followed Dr. Deep\u2019s *\"middle ground\u2019* approach because it agreed with the order in which creditors were being paid under this assumption.355\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 176-177 referring to Award, \u00b6\u00b6 71-83 and 84-86; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 128.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 129.\n\n349.\n\nIn any event, Claimants contend that these arguments are irrelevant because the Committee is not tasked with reviewing whether the Tribunal awarded compensation for the management fees in a correct manner but rather whether it manifestly exceeded its powers in doing so - for which Respondent\u2019s arguments provide no basis.356\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 137; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 129.\n\n**3. Committee\u2019s Analysis**\n---------------------------\n\n350.\n\nIn the context of the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation of Claimants\u2019 alleged damages, Respondent advances two annulment grounds: (i) that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers (Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention); and (ii) that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons for its decision (Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n351.\n\nThe Committee makes reference to the general considerations above on the scope of its review under these two annulment grounds and agrees with the committee\u2019s finding in *Impregiio v. Argentina,* made specifically in relation to the assessment of damages:\n\n*\"The Committee cannot review* de novo *the facts, evidence and criteria used by the Tribunal in assessing the damages nor the amount of compensation awarded to* [the claimant],... *Of course, the assessment of damages cannot be arbitrary, but a Tribunal\u2019s determination of the amount of compensation allows for a high level of discretion and a disagreement with the criteria used by the Tribunal cannot be a groundfor annulment of an award.\"357*\n\n**A/CLA-42 / AL A RA 34 \u00b6 160.**\n\n352.\n\nBearing this in mind, the Committee will assess the three elements of the Tribunal\u2019s evaluation that Respondent claims to be tainted with annullable errors: (i) the valuation period; (ii) the construction of the valuation exercise; and (iii) the management fees.\n\n**a. Compensation for the Effects of a Measure that Did Not Violate the BITs**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n353.\n\nFirst, Respondent alleges that the Tribunal\u2019s decision in its Award to adopt a valuation period up to the regular end of the concession period in 2023, and thus to award damages for alleged losses incurred after the termination of the Concession Contract by Argentina in 2006, contradicts its earlier finding in the Decision on Liability that such termination did not violate the BITs and that it did not have jurisdiction to judge whether it violated the Concession Contract.358 Respondent takes the position that any losses incurred after the termination are to be assessed by the Argentine courts, which is the competent forum to assess whether the termination amounts to a breach of the Concession Contract.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 246.\n\n354.\n\nThe Committee notes that Respondent has raised the same objection before the Tribunal, which thoroughly dealt with it in its Award. Specifically, it held:\n\n*\"The Tribunal does not agree with Argentina on this point. Under international law, as noted above, the Claimants \u2019* [sic] *are entitled to full compensation for what they have lost as a consequence of Argentina\u2019s treaty violations. Just as one would not value the loss of a house in a fire based on the market value of the burned structure after the fire, but rather would value the house just before the fire\u2019s occurrence, this Tribunal must* *begin its valuation of what the Claimants have lost as a result of Argentina\u2019s illegal actions at a point in time just before those actions took place. In its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal determined that the first breach of the treaties took place on January 6, 2002. Just before that point in time, AASA, and therefore the Claimants, had the right to a revenue stream which would continue for another 21 years until the year 2023, not just for another five years until the year 2006 when, unknown to them in 2002, Argentina would terminate the Concession. To limit the valuation period to five instead of twenty-one years would, of course, seriously undervalue the investments lost as a consequence of Argentina\u2019s treaty violations. It is true that the risk of termination was always present in the Concession; however, that risk, along with other risks, would be accounted for in the rate applied to discount to present value the remaining twenty-one years of projected cash flows. The termination of the Concession Contract by Argentina, even if not illegal under the BITs, cannot exonerate it from its obligation to repair the consequences of its wrongful act in denying fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants\u2019 investments.\"359*\n\nAward, \u00b6 36.\n\n355.\n\nIn the above quoted paragraph, the Tribunal explained its approach to value the investment from the perspective of a potential buyer in January 2002, *i.e.,* the date of the first Treaty breach. At that time, a potential buyer would not have known that the Concession Contract would be terminated five years later by Argentina but would have accounted for such risk only as part of the discount rate it would have applied to the projected future cash flows. In light of this explanation, the Committee does not agree with Respondent that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by awarding damages for a measure it had not found to be in violation of the BIT. Likewise, the Tribunal did not fail to state reasons for its decision to adopt a valuation period up to the regular end of the concession period.\n\n356.\n\nDuring the hearing, Respondent appeared to modify its initial argument by placing more emphasis on the question of whether the risk of termination, which the Tribunal acknowledged was always present in the Concession Contract, was actually taken into account in the discount rate applied by the Tribunal-appointed expert Dr. Deep. The Tribunal stated in its Award that *\"that risk, along with other risks, would be accounted for in the rate applied to discount to present value the remaining twenty-one years of projected cash flows.\"* It did not, however, explicitly state whether the risk was actually and specifically incorporated into Dr. Deep\u2019s calculation.\n\n357.\n\nFrom the Parties\u2019 responses to an explicit question from the Committee in this regard, it appears that the risk of early termination was not considered as an individual factor but rather as part of the systematic risk coefficient, the *beta,* that Dr. Deep included to account for *\"the riskiness of a regulated water and sewerage utility such as AASA.\"360* Claimants argued that in the present case, *\"the contractual termination risk is inherent in industry risk... reflected in the beta\"* because *\"[t]his is an industry in which investors sign contracts with the State\"361*\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34 \u00b6** 221\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 342 lines 8-11.\n\n358.\n\nRespondent, however, took issue with the sources used by Dr. Deep to compile such *beta, i.e.,* (i) ***beta*** values used by the \u00b6\u00b6 water regulator to set water tariffs in the \u00b6\u00b6 for 2000-2005; and (ii) the (general) unlevered ***beta*** for developing countries surveyed by Prof. Damodaran.362 Specifically, Respondent argued that the average ***beta*** of \u00b6\u00b6 water companies (0.5) and emerging markets in general (0.44) did not adequately reflect the risk of water companies operating in emerging markets, including any specific termination risk.363\n\n*Cf.* **Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6** 375 and Table 25.\n\nRespondent argued that \"[t]/ze *beta considered by Deep for the water sector in the \u00b6\u00b6, where termination risk is supposed to be lower than in emerging markets, is higher. This proves that the beta considered in the discount rate applied to AASA does not include the termination risk.\"* Argentina\u2019s Rebuttal Statement dated 9 November 2016, slide 56. *See* also Transcript (Day 2), p. 276 line 18 - p. 277 line 2.\n\n359.\n\nBased on the arguments presented by the Parties, it is indeed not entirely clear to the Committee whether the discount rate applied by Dr. Deep, and specifically the systematic risk coefficient *beta,* adequately reflected the risk that Argentina might at some point in the future terminate the Concession Contract. However, the Committee recalls its agreement with the finding of the *Impregiio* committee above that the Tribunal has *\"a high level of discretion\"* as to the criteria it applies in its assessment of damages and that *\"a disagreement with the criteria used by the Tribunal cannot be a ground for annulment of an award.\"364* In line with this consideration, it is not for this Committee to re-consider the view taken by the Tribunal that the criteria applied by Dr. Deep to compile the *beta* sufficiently accounted for the termination risk that later materialized in 2006.\n\n**A/CLA-42 / AL A RA 34, \u00b6** 160.\n\n360.\n\nIn the same context, Respondent also criticized that the *\"without-measures\"* scenario applied by Dr. Deep, *i.e.,* the *but-for* scenario by which the Tribunal intended to determine how the value of Claimants\u2019 investment would have evolved in the absence of Respondent\u2019s Treaty violations, excluded not only the two measures that the Tribunal had found to be in violation of the BITs but also the termination of the Concession Contract. During the hearing, Respondent further pointed out that the *\"with-measures\"* scenario, *i.e.,* the scenario to which the Tribunal compared the hypothetical *but-for* scenario, likewise excluded the termination event and thus did not reflect the actual or real scenario examined by the Parties\u2019 experts but rather a second hypothetical scenario.\n\n361.\n\nAccording to Dr. Deep\u2019s explanation, this *\"with-measures\"* scenario was intended to capture how AASA *would* have evolved after 2002, this time in the presence of the unlawful measures and, correspondingly, the absence of the measures re-establishing the financial equilibrium; contrary to the actual or real scenario, however this *\"with-measured'* scenario again excluded measures *\"that were not necessarily found to be in breach of the BITs, including the termination of the Concession Contract in 2006.\"365* Dr. Deep clarified:\n\n*\"[O]ur objective in defining the* with-Measures *scenario is to be able to estimate the damages suffered by the Claimants due to the Measures* relative *to the* but-for *scenario. The simplest way to do this is to maintain all of the assumptions of the* but-for *scenario except for the tariff-related regulatory interventions whose absence is what constitutes the Measures that have been considered a breach of the Bilateral Investment Treaties by the Tribunal.\"366*\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6** 94.\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6** 95. *See* also \u00b6\u00b6 3-4 and \u00b6 61.\n\n362.\n\nThe Committee notes that while the Tribunal referred to the *\"with-measures\"* scenario in its Award,367 it did not discuss the fact that it did not simply reflect the *\"as-is\"* situation but rather a second hypothetical scenario, nor did it discuss why both scenarios excluded measures that were not found to be in violation of the BITs and, most importantly, the termination of the Concession Contract. However, in light of the Tribunal\u2019s finding that *\"[t]he starting point of the Valuation Period is connected with the date of first breach of fair and equitable treatment by Argentina, in January 2002,* \"368 it can reasonably be inferred that the Tribunal intended to compare two scenarios, both from the perspective of January 2002, of how Claimants\u2019 investment would have evolved in the presence and in the absence of the two Treaty breaches. While the Tribunal did not provide explicit reasons why *both* scenarios excluded the termination of the Concession Contract, this naturally follows from adopting the perspective of January 2002. At that time, it was not known that the termination would occur in 2006 and the risk of such termination was reflected in both scenarios in the same way, *i.e.,* in the industry-specific *beta.*\n\n*Cf.* Award, \u00b6 28.\n\nAward, \u00b6 37.\n\n363.\n\nIt is therefore consistent with the Tribunal\u2019s approach to disregard the termination event itself from both scenarios in order to account exclusively for the difference resulting from the two Treaty breaches. While Respondent may disagree with the approach adopted by the Tribunal, this does not constitute either a manifest excess of powers, given that the Tribunal did not award damages for a measure it did not find to be in violation of the BITs, nor a failure to state reasons, given that an informed reader can reasonably follow the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning to its conclusion.\n\n364.\n\nFinally, Respondent argued during the hearing that there was a contradiction between the Tribunal\u2019s finding in its Decision on Liability that there was no expropriation of Claimants\u2019 investment and its evaluation of damages in the Award where Dr. Deep allegedly valued the investment as if an expropriation had taken place. The Committee notes that Respondent raised the same objection already before the Tribunal, which clarified in its Award:\n\n*\"... [C]ontrary to Argentina\u2019s objection, Dr. Deep was not engaged in making an expropriation valuation. The construction of a without measures scenario was only the first step in his proposed methodology. He then had to value the Claimants\u2019 investments in a* \u2018with measures\u2019 *scenario and finally to subtract the value of the latter from the value of the former in order to arrive at a value of the loss sustained. Dr. Deep correctly determined that the* \u2018with measures\u2019 *scenario resulted in a complete loss of the Claimants\u2019 investments. Their value was therefore zero. That amount would then be subtracted from the value to be attributed to the various elements of the Claimants\u2019 investment had Argentina accorded them fair and equitable treatment. Thus the conceptual framework for the valuation process in a case of denial of equitable treatment is quite different from that of an expropriation case.\"369*\n\nAward, \u00b6 56.\n\n365.\n\nFollowing a detailed discussion of Dr. Deep\u2019s calculation of the value of Claimants\u2019 investments in both scenarios, the Tribunal ultimately agreed that in the *\"with-measures\"* scenario, *\"the measures Argentina did take during the crisis would have resulted in a negative cash flow to AASA \u2019s equity holders in 2002 and it would have remained negative throughout the life of the Concession. In short, the Claimants\u2019 equity would have been worthless.\"370*\n\nAward, \u00b6 102.\n\n366.\n\nConsequently, the Committee cannot agree with Respondent\u2019s argument that Dr. Deep valued Claimants\u2019 investment as if an expropriation had taken place; rather, the Tribunal agreed with Dr. Deep that the value to be subtracted from the hypothetical value of Claimants\u2019 investment in the *but-for* scenario was zero. Therefore, the Committee finds that there is no contradiction in this regard between the findings made in the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Liability and in its Award.\n\n**b. Methodology and Calculation of Damages**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n367.\n\nAs to the methodology and calculation of damages, Respondent advances two arguments: (i) the Tribunal did not base the **but-for** scenario on the applicable legal framework and contradicted its earlier findings because it modeled the **but-for** scenario on the basis of achieving financial equilibrium pursuant to Resolution 602/99 dated 8 July 1999 despite the fact that this Resolution was never adopted, and it even went beyond the measures prescribed in Resolution 602/99 by assuming a liquidity relief in the form of a one-year interest-free loan and the total repayment of sponsored debt; and (ii) the Tribunal applied pre-award interest at a rate higher than that agreed upon by the Parties\u2019 experts.\n\n**i. Modeling of the** ***But-For*** **Scenario**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Aim to Achieve Financial Equilibrium**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n368.\n\nRespondent alleges that the Tribunal did not correctly take into account the legal framework it had deemed applicable in its Decision on Liability when modeling the **but-for** scenario in its Award. Specifically, Respondent claims that the Tribunal\u2019s assumption in its Award that the **but-for** scenario would involve a tariff adjustment to ensure the Concession Contract was in financial equilibrium contradicted its earlier finding that the term *\"Equilibrium Principle\"* did not appear in the Water Decree and that Article 44(d) of the Water Decree adopted a more flexible standard that sought to apportion the risks between the private investors and the Argentine State.\n\n369.\n\nIn its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal found that *\"the legal framework of the Concession sought to achieve and balance two basic objectives\"* The first objective was to attract private and foreign capital and know-how, as a result of which the framework needed to ensure that potential investors would earn *\"a reasonable profit\"* through the tariff system and that changes affecting the profitability of their enterprise would be dealt with by virtue of the mechanism for revising the tariff.371 The second objective was to ensure that water and sewage services could be provided efficiently and at low cost, which is why the framework provided the Argentine authorities with *\"a certain degree of regulatory discretion in setting tariffs and in determining other important matters relating to AASA\u2019s activities.\"* Specifically with regard to the disputed term *\"Equilibrium Principle,\"* the Tribunal found:\n\n*\"Although the Claimants assert that the tariff regime of the Water Decree was based on the* \u2018Equilibrium Principle\u2019 *guaranteeing the Concessionaire a recovery of all costs plus a return on invested capital, it is important to note three features of the legal framework at this point: 1) the term* \u2018Equilibrium Principle\u2019 *appears nowhere in the text of the Water Decree;* *2) the Water Decree conditions tariffs on the attainment of service efficiency by the Concessionaire; and 3) the Concessionaire was to assume the business risks of the operation.*\n\n*... [I]nstead of specifically mandating that the tariff was to provide for all costs and a reasonable return to the investor, Article 44 (d) of the Water Decree adopted a more flexible standard in stating, as noted above:*\n\n\u2018The prices and tariffs shall *tend (tender\u00e1n)* to reflect the economic cost of the water and wastewater services, including a margin of profit for the Concessionaire and include all costs arising from the approved expansion plans.\u2019 *(emphasis added).\"372*\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 124.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 125-126.\n\n370.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal found that the legal framework did seek to protect the Concessionaire from certain of the risks involved with the operation of a water and sewage system of Buenos Aires and held that *\"[t]he Concession\u2019s legal framework sought to apportion those risks between the private investors and the Argentine State\"373*\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 126.\n\n371.\n\nThere is a dispute between the Parties as to whether there is a contradiction between the findings of the Tribunal in its Decision on Liability and its adoption in the Award of the *but-for* scenario modeled by Dr. Deep, which included, *inter alia, \"a full review of the economics of the Concession Contract... in 2003\"* Respondent points in particular to the Tribunal\u2019s statement that *\"[t]he aim of such a review was to ensure that the Concession achieved financial equilibrium as prescribed by the Water Decree\"374*\n\nAward, \u00b6 45, 46.\n\n372.\n\nThe Committee notes that Dr. Deep explicitly quoted the Tribunal\u2019s finding regarding the absence of the term **\"Equilibrium Principle\"** from the text of the Water Decree in his Final Report and then stated that *\"[t]hus the regulator had significant discretion in implementing the mechanism that would establish the financial equilibrium of the Concession Contract in accordance with the principles of the Water Decree\"375* This statement demonstrates that Dr. Deep did not consider there to be a contradiction between stating on the one hand that the term **\"Equilibrium Principle\"** was absent from the Water Decree, and finding on the other hand that the Water Decree nevertheless aimed to achieve financial equilibrium of the Concession. To the contrary, Dr. Deep opined that *\"[t]he determination of financial equilibrium would reflect the principles outlined in Article 44(d) of the Water Decree.\"376*\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6 185.**\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6 74.**\n\n373.\n\nDr. Deep further considered that the so-called *\"EFNQ mechanism,\"* which ETOSS *(Ente Tripartito de Obras y Servicios Sanitarios,* the regulatory authority in Argentina) used in 1998 to determine the then-required tariff adjustment and which was described in Resolution 602/99 of July 1999, *\"was intended to serve as a guide toward establishing the long-run financial equilibrium of the Concession\"377* In response to Respondent\u2019s objection to his reliance on Resolution 602/99, which was undisputedly never adopted, Dr. Deep acknowledged that it was not for him to determine its applicability in the *but-for* scenario but noted that *\"Resolution 602/99 is the only document at our disposal that describes an example of the implementation of the equilibrium principle. We* [have relied on this document] *because we feel that this is better than devising a hypothetical scenario from scratch.\"378*\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6\u00b6185, 121.** *See* **also \u00b6\u00b667-68 and \u00b6\u00b6176-177.**\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6453.**\n\n374.\n\nIn its Award, the Tribunal noted, *inter alia,* that neither Party had provided it with *\"another equally detailed and convincing scenario of how a reasonable regulator intent on according fair and equitable treatment to AASA would have behaved\"* In the absence of any competing scenario, it further considered that *\"it need only find that Dr. Deep\u2019s scenarios* [sic] *is a reasonable hypothesis of what a reasonable regulator, intent on fair and equitable treatment of AASA, would do in a comparable situation\"* It then explained why it considered Dr. Deep\u2019s hypothetical *but-for* scenario, including the application of Resolution 602/99, indeed reasonable. In particular, it stated that *\"while Resolution 602/99 may or may not be legally binding, it was nonetheless, as the product of an agency of the Argentine* *Government, strong evidence of how a reasonable regulator would act in the situation that AASA and the regulators faced at the time of the Argentine crisis\"* In addition, the Tribunal considered it *\"significant that ETOSS applied Resolution 602/99 in its dealings with AASA before 2002\"* and therefore found that it was justified for Dr. Deep to use this resolution to build his *but-for* scenario.379\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 53-55.\n\n375.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee finds that there is no contradiction between the Tribunal\u2019s findings regarding the applicable legal framework in its Decision on Liability on the one hand, and regarding the reasonableness of the *but-for* scenario modeled by Dr. Deep in its Award on the other. In particular, the Committee cannot agree with Respondent\u2019s argument that the absence of the term *\"Equilibrium Principle\"* from the Water Decree excluded a finding that this Decree nevertheless aimed to achieve financial equilibrium for the Concession. To the contrary, the Tribunal made it reasonably clear that there was no strict equilibrium in terms of a guarantee implemented by an automatic adjustment of the tariffs in fixed intervals and/or according to fixed indices but that the regulator rather possessed a certain degree of discretion in how it sought to achieve the aims of the legal framework - one of which was to ensure that private investors enjoyed a reasonable profit.\n\n376.\n\nThe Committee further considers that the application of Resolution 602/99 in the *but-for* scenario does not amount to an excess of powers nor to a failure to state reasons. The Tribunal explicitly addressed Respondent\u2019s objection that it was not part of the applicable framework and gave convincing reasons why it nevertheless considered it to be a reasonable indication of how a reasonable regulator would have behaved in the *but-for* scenario built by Dr. Deep. Any disagreement with these reasons cannot give rise to a ground for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(b) Liquidity Relief in the Form of a One-Year Interest-Free Loan**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n377.\n\nRespondent further claims that the *but-for* scenario also included measures that were not even provided for in Resolution 602/99 and, specifically, that there is no basis for the one-year interest-free loan that Dr. Deep assumed Argentina would have granted to AASA in 2002. While Claimants do not dispute that this concrete measure cannot be found in the applicable legal framework nor in Resolution 602/99, they point out that this assumption has to be viewed together with Dr. Deep\u2019s further assumption, *i.e.,* an additional capital infusion by the investors, described by the Tribunal as *\"mutual sacrifice\"*\n\n378.\n\nThe Committee notes that, initially, both Parties objected to Dr. Deep\u2019s assumptions before the Tribunal. While Claimants sought to assume an *\"outright subsidy or other type of permanent capital infusion by Argentina\"* and objected to an additional capital infusion to be made by the investors, Respondent protested against the assumption that it would have provided an interest-free loan while *\"facing the worst crisis in the country\u2019s history.\"380*\n\n*Cf.* Award, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n\n379.\n\nThe Tribunal noted these objections and thoroughly addressed them in its Award. It acknowledged that these concrete measures were imposed neither by the applicable framework nor by Resolution 602/99, but noted that the Parties would have had to work together to solve the liquidity crisis faced by AASA in 2002. It further considered that both Parties would have had *\"strong reasons\"* to adopt the measures suggested by Dr. Deep or similar measures in order to ensure AASA\u2019s continued existence.381 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, these measures were in line with the three principles it identified *\"that would guide a reasonable regulator intent on according fair and equitable treatment to AASA\" :* (i) the short-term and long-term continuation of the important public service provided by AASA; (ii) the preservation of the entity providing such service; and (iii) the principles of cooperation and of shared sacrifice as embodied in the Concession Contract.382\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 51-53.\n\nAward, \u00b6 54.\n\n380.\n\nIn particular with regard to the third principle, the Tribunal noted in its Decision on Liability that Article 5.1 of the Concession Contract required the parties to *\"use all means at their disposal to establish and maintain a fluid relationship that facilitates the performance of this Concession Contract\"* and found that contrary to this obligation, *\"the Argentine authorities demonstrated extreme rigidity in their dealings with AASA and the Claimants\"383* In its Award, the Tribunal then found that the *but-for* scenario modeled by Dr. Deep was in accordance with these principles and in particular *\"reflect[ed] a partnership relationship between AASA and the Argentine government in that the ultimate solution requires mutual sacrifice by both sides.\"384*\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 233.\n\nAward, \u00b6 55. *See* also \u00b6\u00b6 42-44.\n\n381.\n\nConsequently, it is apparent to the Committee that the Tribunal adopted the *but-for* scenario modeled by Dr. Deep, including the one-year interest-free loan to AASA, in order to achieve a balanced solution and a middle-ground position between the positions of the Parties. While this may not have been the only possible solution the Tribunal could have adopted, it does constitute a reasonable and balanced hypothesis based on the submissions and evidence presented by the Parties as well as the considerations of Dr. Deep, applying the concept of *\"sharedsacrifice.\"385* The Tribunal further gave detailed reasons for its decision, consistent with its earlier findings on the necessary cooperation between the Parties, in accordance with the Concession Contract and the general principle of good faith that would, in the *but-for* scenario, *\"in all probability,\"* have led to a set of agreements ensuring the viability of the Concession.386\n\n*Cf.* Award, \u00b6 54.\n\nAward, \u00b6 31.\n\n382.\n\nIn addition, the Committee does not agree with Respondent that a one-year interest-free loan contradicted the Tribunal\u2019s findings in its Decision on Liability that, under the applicable legal framework the business risk of the Concession had to be assumed by the Concessionaire, because this assumption would allegedly have shifted the financing risk of the Concession to the State. In this regard, the Committee notes that Dr. Deep set out the features of immediate liquidity relief as envisaged in Resolution 602/99, which include the following: *\"[T]he intention of liquidity relief is the provision of short-term relief to help the Concessionaire surmount the adverse short-term impact of the change in the Convertibility law. The long-term impact of the change in parity is a financing risk that would remain with the Concessionaire\" '387* Dr. Deep then explained why he considered a one-year interest-free loan to be in line with this feature. Specifically with regard to the financing risk; he stated: *\"Financing risk is a business risk that should remain with the Concessionaire in the longer term. Therefore we have postulated that the amount of liquidity relief provided to AASA in 2002 in the but-for scenario would be paid back by AASA in 2003,\"388*\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6** 79 lit. b.\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6 82.**\n\n383.\n\nIn its Award, the Tribunal found that Dr. Deep\u2019s proposal of a one-year interest-free loan appeared to be *\"a reasonable and constructive device within the spirit and intent to the Resolution 602/99 to enable AASA to avoid defaulting on its debt obligations at least cost to Argentina.\"* It then gave detailed reasons for its finding, including the ones summarized at paragraph 379 above, and concluded that *\"the fulfillment by Argentina of its obligation of fair and equitable treatment would* in all probability *have fostered cooperation between the parties to achieve a solution of the kind suggested by Dr. Deep\u2019s Model,\"389*\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 47-53.\n\n384.\n\nThe Committee again finds that, while the concrete form of immediate liquidity relief assumed by Dr. Deep may not have been the only possible solution the Tribunal could have adopted in its *but-for* scenario, it does appear to be a reasonable and balanced scenario for all the reasons given by the Tribunal in its Award. Consequently, the Committee finds that by adopting these concrete assumptions, the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers nor make contradictory findings.\n\n**(c) Total Repayment of Sponsored Debt**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nRespondent further alleges that the Tribunal exceeded its powers and contradicted its earlier findings when it decided in its Award that AASA\u2019s guaranteed debt: (i) was a protected investment under the BITs; and (ii) would have been repaid (entirely) in the *but-for* scenario.\n\n**(i) Sponsored Debt as Protected Investment under the BITs**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n386.\n\nFirst, there is a dispute as to whether the Tribunal would have had to (expressly) determine in its Decision on Jurisdiction that the sponsored debt was an investment protected by the BIT, which it did not, or whether it was sufficient to make such a finding in its Award.390 Claimants point out that in the underlying proceedings Respondent never objected to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction in this regard, even though Claimants argued as early as in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction that *\"shares and other forms of participation in the Concession\"* formed part of their investments under the BITs. They specifically argued that, *inter alia,* their *\"other forms of participation in AASA, i.e. as lenders, guarantors in support of AASA\u2019s financial obligations* **(Debt Supporter),** *and Suez\u2019s participation also as operator, are all* \u2018investments\u2019 *under the terms of the French Treaty\"* or in the case of AGBAR, \"\u2018investments\u2019 *under the terms of the Spanish Treaty.\"391* Claimants further note that they consistently sought damages in respect of this investment and that Respondent never argued that the Tribunal did not have power to award such damages but rather that Argentina did not owe anything because these losses resulted from the alleged riskiness of Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n*Cf.* Award, \u00b6 67.\n\n**Exhibit A/C-33, \u00b6\u00b6** 6(b), 8(b)(ii) and (iii) (emphasis in original).\n\n387.\n\nRespondent does not dispute that it never raised an objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction on Claimants\u2019 claims for damages regarding AASA\u2019s secured debt. However, it claims that if the Tribunal considered that the sponsored debt formed part of Claimants\u2019 investment, it would have had to take an affirmative decision on its own motion on this aspect of its jurisdiction in order to enable the Parties to align their arguments in the subsequent phases of the proceedings with the scope of Claimants\u2019 investment as found by the Tribunal.\n\n388.\n\nThe Committee notes that, while it generally agrees with the statement of the tribunal in *Wintershall v. Argentina* quoting the ICJ that a court or tribunal *\"must always examine* proprio motu*the question of its own jurisdiction,\"392* there is no requirement in the ICSID Convention that such decision be taken in a preliminary decision on jurisdiction. It is clear from both the structure and the contents of the Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction that its findings therein were limited to the six objections to jurisdiction that Respondent had raised before the Tribunal. It did not, however, state that it thereby explicitly confine the scope of its jurisdiction to the items discussed in this Decision.\n\n**AL A RA 95, \u00b6\u00b6** 67-68 (emphasis in original).\n\n389.\n\nIn addition, Rule 41(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that an objection to jurisdiction shall be made *\"as early as possible\"* but in any event *\"no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for the filing of the counter-memorial, or, if the objection relates to an ancillary claim, for the filing of the rejoinder\"* As pointed out by Claimants, they argued already in their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction that AASA\u2019s sponsored debt formed part of their investment. Therefore, it would have been for Respondent to raise any objection it may have had on this point in its subsequent submission. As it undisputedly failed to do so, Respondent cannot now be heard with its belated argument that the Tribunal did not have power to award damages for AASA\u2019s sponsored debt.\n\n390.\n\nIn any event, Respondent does not dispute that the merits of Claimants\u2019 claim for losses incurred in connection with the sponsored debt were extensively argued before the Tribunal, again without Respondent raising the argument that the Tribunal did not have power to do so. Thus, Respondent\u2019s suggestion that the lack of an express affirmation in the Decision on Jurisdiction prevented it from making submissions on this matter has no merit.\n\n**(ii) (Full) Repayment of Sponsored Debt**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n391.\n\nThere is a further dispute between the Parties as to whether the Tribunal\u2019s finding in its Award that Respondent had to pay damages for the costs Claimants incurred to extinguish their debt guarantee obligations contradicted its earlier findings that: (i) pursuant to the Concession Contract, the financial risk was assumed by the Concessionaire;393 and (ii) loans payable in US dollars presented a financial risk to AASA.394\n\nDecision on Liability, \" 106, 113.\n\nAward, \u00b6 60.\n\n392.\n\nThe Committee notes that Respondent advanced the argument that the risk of dollar-denominated loans was for AASA and Claimants to bear before the Tribunal, which dealt with this argument in its Award. First, the Tribunal found that the alleged high riskiness of financing AASA\u2019s operations with US-dollar denominated loans despite the fact that its revenues were entirely in Argentine pesos did not exclude sponsored debt from the protection of the BITs. While acknowledging that it is *\"totally appropriate and is standard practice in finance and in law\"* to take into account risk in valuing the loss of an investment, the Tribunal emphasized:\n\n\"[W]*ith respect to the payments on guaranteed debts, the Tribunal is not seeking to value an investment in AASA made by the Claimants in the past but rather it is seeking to actualize to the present time the amount of known, liquidated, actual losses sustained by each Claimant in the past\"*\n\nThe Tribunal thus concluded that, as Claimants would not have been required to make any guarantee payments if Respondent had accorded fair and equitable treatment to Claimants\u2019 investments, their losses were *\"a direct consequence of Argentina\u2019s treaty violations\"395*\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.\n\n393.\n\nIn light of this explanation, the Committee finds that there is no contradiction between the Tribunal\u2019s finding on the allocation of financial risk to AASA and its investors on the one hand, and its decision to award damages for the costs incurred by Claimants in connection with sponsored debt on the other. By doing the latter, the Tribunal did not shift the financial risk to the Argentine State, as alleged by Respondent, but it rather compensated Claimants for losses they would not have incurred if Respondent had observed its Treaty obligations. In other words, Respondent\u2019s Treaty violations do not represent a materialization of any financial risk to be borne by the Concessionaire but rather a breach of international law whose consequences were to be compensated by the award of damages rendered by the Tribunal.\n\n394.\n\nThe Committee is aware of the additional argument raised by Respondent that the assumption of a total repayment of the sponsored debt in the *but-for* scenario ignored the Parties\u2019 submissions and Dr. Deep\u2019s projections on whether a potential tariff review would have made such repayment possible. As the assumption that AASA would have been able to fully repay its sponsored debt is based on the further assumption discussed above that it would have been granted liquidity relief in the form of a one-year interest-free loan by Respondent, the Committee refers to its conclusion above that this concrete form of liquidity relief as assumed by the Tribunal appears to be a reasonable and balanced scenario under the circumstances. The same must then apply to the consequential assumption that this relief would have enabled AASA to fully repay its sponsored debt and, thus, that Claimants would not have incurred any costs in having to make repayments in their capacity as guarantors of such debt in the *but-for* scenario.\n\n395.\n\nFinally, the Committee notes Respondent\u2019s argument that it was contradictory for the Tribunal to award compensation to Claimants for the losses they incurred but not to afford the same treatment to Argentina in relation to payments it made, allegedly in an identical capacity, as a guarantor of a debt incurred by AASA, to the IDB. The Committee notes, however, that Respondent raised the argument that the payments it made should be deducted from Claimants\u2019 damages before the Tribunal, which dealt with this argument in its Award. Specifically, the Tribunal noted that the loan in question had been made to Argentina in 1989 and while AASA, as part of the privatization process of the Buenos Aires water and sewage systems, had agreed to reimburse such payments to Argentina, the State remained liable on that loan obligation to the IDB. As Respondent had not advanced any principle of international law supporting its contention, the Tribunal \"re/ec/[ed] *Argentina\u2019s claim that the amounts that it paid on a pre-existing IDB loan for which it was primarily liable should be deducted from any compensation that the Tribunal might award to the Claimants\"* It further added that if Respondent had observed its Treaty obligations, AASA would also have been able to service the IDB loan repayments; thus, *\"to reduce the amount of the compensation awarded to the Claimants for their losses on sponsored debt would amount to denying the Claimants full compensation, as required by international law, and amount to allowing Argentina to benefit from the violation of its treaty obligations\"396*\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 69-70.\n\n396.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, it is apparent that, contrary to what Respondent suggests, Argentina did not make the payments to the IDB in a capacity identical to that of the shareholders in AASA on the sponsored debt because, in that case, the State was rather the primary debtor that remained liable to the IDB even after the privatization process. Therefore, the Committee sees no contradiction in making a distinction between the two situations. In addition, the Tribunal held that AASA\u2019s non-ability to service the reimbursements to Respondent was a direct consequence of Respondent\u2019s Treaty obligations, which was a further reason for not awarding Respondent any compensation for the payments it had incurred without being reimbursed by AASA.\n\n397.\n\nConsequently, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers and did not fail to state reasons for its decision to award damages for the losses Claimants incurred by having to repay AASA\u2019s sponsored debt.\n\n**(d) Conclusion on the Modeling of the But-For Scenario**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n398.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not formulate the *but-for* scenario in an obvious contradiction to the applicable legal framework or Resolution 602/99 and therefore did not manifestly exceed its powers nor did it fail to state reasons for its decision.\n\n**ii. Interest Rate Applied by the Tribunal**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n399.\n\nRespondent claims that the Tribunal acted *ultra petita* and thus exceeded its powers because it applied interest at a rate that was, allegedly, higher than the interest rate agreed by the Parties\u2019 experts during the proceedings.397\n\n*Cf.* Transcript (Day 2), p. 280 lines 17-22.\n\n400.\n\nClaimants do not dispute that the Parties agreed *\"at an earlier stage of the proceedings\"* on the use of the US Treasury Bill rate but note that they later accepted Dr. Deep\u2019s proposal to use the Eurodollar rate that was ultimately applied by the Tribunal.398 Specifically, Claimants point to their Comments on the Preliminary Report of the Financial Expert to the Tribunal where they stated that *\"[a]lthough Dr. Deep\u2019s interest rates are, on average, lower, the Claimants do not object to their application\"399* Claimants further emphasize that Respondent also commented on the Eurodollar rate in its Comments on the Final Report of Dr. Deep and requested that the Tribunal redirect him to use the US Treasury Bill rate.400 In addition, Claimants argue that the determination of the interest rate was in any event within the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s *\"large margin of discretion\"* on this point.401\n\nClaimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 72.\n\n**Exhibit.-VC-32. \u00b6** 8.\n\n**Exhibit A/C-31, \u00b6** 83.\n\n*Cf.* **A/CLA-30, \u00b6 96.**\n\n401.\n\nIn any event, Claimants dispute that the Eurodollar rate applied by the Tribunal results, on average, in a higher interest amount than the US Treasury Bill rate requested by Respondent. During the hearing, Respondent presented a calculation pursuant to which the interest rate proposed by Dr. Deep yielded an average of 2.47% between 2006 and 2012, while the interest rate proposed by the Parties\u2019 experts yielded an average of 1.77% during the same time period.402 Claimants claimed, however, that Respondent\u2019s calculation is *\"inaccurate, and it misrepresents what Dr. Deep actually did, and it misrepresents what the U.S. T-bill rate actually is\"403* They further presented a calculation pursuant to which Claimants\u2019 losses as of November 2014 were in fact lower when updated using the Eurodollar rate (USD 404.5 million) than when updated using the US Treasury Bill rate (USD 419.1 million).404\n\nArgentina\u2019s Rebuttal Statement dated November 9, 2016, slide 68.\n\nTranscript (Day 2), p. 348 line 22 - p. 349 line 2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Responses to the Committee\u2019s Questions, slide 33.\n\n402.\n\nIn light of the above, the Committee cannot agree with Respondent\u2019s argument that the Tribunal acted *ultra petita.* First, the Committee considers that Respondent has not sufficiently established that the amount of interest awarded by the Tribunal was indeed higher than that sought by Claimants. Second, the Committee considers that in light of Claimants\u2019 acceptance of the Eurodollar rate in their comments on Dr. Deep\u2019s Preliminary Report, they included a request for interest calculated by using the Eurodollar rate in their request for relief, which in any event excluded an act of *ultra petita* on the part of the Tribunal in this regard.\n\n403.\n\nTherefore, the Committee does not have to express an opinion on the more general question whether a tribunal could be considered to have acted *ultra petita,* and thus have manifestly exceeded its powers, by awarding interest at a rate that ultimately yielded an amount higher than that sought by the claimant.\n\n**c. Management Contract**\n--------------------------\n\n404.\n\nFinally, Respondent alleges that the Tribunal exceeded its powers and failed to state reasons for its decision to award to Suez damages for unpaid management fees from 2002 up to the regular end of the concession period in 2023. Respondent argues that: (i) the Tribunal failed to determine in its Decision on Jurisdiction that such fees were a protected investment under the BITs; (ii) the Tribunal awarded damages for services that were never rendered, given that Respondent terminated the Concession Contract in 2006; and (iii) the Tribunal failed to assess the legal nature of Suez\u2019s claim, even though a classification would have been essential for the calculation of such claim.\n\n**i. Management Contract as Protected Investment under the BIT**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n405.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s first argument, it is undisputed that the Tribunal did not determine in its Decision on Jurisdiction that the Management Contract or Suez\u2019s services rendered under this Contract formed part of Suez\u2019s investment protected by the BIT. The Committee further notes that Respondent raised the argument that the Management Contract was not an investment protected by the BIT and that the damages phase was in any event not the appropriate stage to make such determination already before the Tribunal, which dealt with this argument in its Award. It held that Suez\u2019s claim for unpaid management fees was justified because *\"the management Contract... was an integral part of Suez\u2019s investment in AASA as covered by the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\"* The Tribunal noted that the applicable legal framework required that at least one substantial shareholder be designated as the Concession\u2019s Operator and, thus, \"[a] *management contract was a* sine qua non *for any group seeking to invest in AASA.\"405* Based on this finding, the Tribunal held:\n\n*\"The Management Contract being an integral part of the Claimants\u2019 investment, there is no need to review whether the Management Contract in and of itself constitutes an investment for the purposes of the ICSID Convention and the France-Argentina BIT. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal nevertheless notes that the Management Contract falls within the definitions given to that word by the applicable BIT in this case and by tribunals interpreting the ICSID Convention..,\"406*\n\nAward, \u00b6 75.\n\nAward, \u00b6 76.\n\n406.\n\nIn light of this explanation given by the Tribunal, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not exceed its powers by finding in the Award that the Management Contract formed part of Suez\u2019s investment. While it appears that Claimants did not present the Management Contract as part of Suez\u2019s investment in the jurisdictional phase, Suez did raise its claim for unpaid fees in Claimants\u2019 first Memorial and Respondent apparently did not raise a jurisdictional objection in this regard. Consequently, the Tribunal did not deal with this issue in its Decision on Jurisdiction nor in its Decision on Liability but only later in the damages phase, when the Parties also debated the merits of Suez\u2019s claim.\n\n**ii. Damages for Services That Were Never Rendered**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n407.\n\nAs to Respondent\u2019s second argument that the Tribunal awarded damages for services that were never rendered, *i.e.,* fees that Suez would have received after 2006, the Committee notes that this argument again relates to the construction of the *but-for* scenario and in particular the Tribunal \u2019 s decision to exclude the termination of the Concession Contract from both valuation scenarios. In this regard, the Committee refers to its considerations above as to why the Tribunal did not commit an annullable error in constructing the valuation scenarios in this manner.\n\n408.\n\nFor the same reasons and also taking into account that the legal framework of the Concession required that the services be provided by a substantial shareholder of the Concessionaire, it was reasonable to assume from a perspective of 2002 that Suez would have continued to render its services to AASA and to be remunerated by AASA for these services up to the regular end of the concession period in 2023. Consequently, it was consistent for the Tribunal to award damages for Suez\u2019s lost profits over the entire remaining concession period.\n\n**iii. Failure to Assess the Legal Nature of Suez\u2019s Claim**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nWith regard to Respondent\u2019s third argument that the Tribunal failed to determine the legal nature of Suez\u2019s claim even though this would have been essential for its calculation, the Committee notes that Dr. Deep in his Final Report indeed posed the question whether the management fees should be considered a return on investment or a payment for services under a management contract.407 He further noted that \"[i]/ *Management Fees are indeed viewed as a component of the expected return on the investors\u2019 equity investment, that would distort the benchmarks related to risk and return (such as leverage, beta, cost of debt) that are used to arrive at an estimate of a fair rate of return for AASA\"408*\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6** 427 lit. b and lit. c.\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6** 429.\n\n410.\n\nDr. Deep then stated that if the management fees were considered compensation for services provided by Suez, they *\"ought to be considered similar to fees payable to any other service provider\"* and *\"could represent (perhaps performance-linked) compensation for the intangible assets that Suez\u2019s expertise is bringing to AASA.\"* Dr. Deep concluded:\n\n*\"[U]nder this perspective, we find the claim for lost Management Fees to be distinct from those related to the equity and debt sponsorship stakes of the Claimants in AASA. We find the claim to be more akin to the claims of any other service providers for lost revenues from the provision of services that it expected to provide in the future\"409*\n\n**Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6** 430.\n\n411.\n\nIn its Award, the Tribunal acknowledged that *\"Dr. Deep was unsure of the legal status of the claim for management fees and therefore computed them on a contingent basis in his* Final Report.\"410 The Tribunal then held that *\"the management Contract was not a separate transaction... but was an integral part of Suez\u2019s investment in AASA as covered by the BIT and the ICSID Convention\"* given that the legal framework required that a substantial investor serve as Technical Operator of the Concession. As noted by the Tribunal, this requirement was intended to ensure Argentina that the Concessionaire *\"wouldnot only invest the necessary financial resources, but would also provide* [the] *essential, intangible assets\"* associated with the management of the water and sewage systems.411 Having noted this particular nature of the Management Contract, the Tribunal further found:\n\n*\"... [G]iven the nature* q/'[the] *responsibilities* [of the Operator] *and the importance of the Concession and to the future of the water and sewage systems of Buenos Arise of the transfer of modern management and technology, things that the system clearly lacked in the past, it was natural and appropriate that Suez be compensated for what it was to provide and that such compensation be additional to the profits it would make as an AASA shareholder. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the loss on management fees is an appropriate item to be considered in awarding compensation to Suez on account of Argentina\u2019s failure to accord it the promised treatment under the France-Argentina BIT.... \"412*\n\nThe Tribunal then considered the quantum of Suez\u2019s loss, in particular in terms of priority in AASA\u2019s income stream, applicability of the contractual penalty interest rate, and timing of the conversion of the payments in Argentine pesos into US dollars. Except for one assumption in the context of actualizing Suez\u2019s claim, the Tribunal followed the calculation presented by Dr. Deep in his Final Report.413\n\nAward, \u00b6 74.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 75, 71.\n\nAward, \u00b6 78.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 79-83.\n\n412.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Management Contract constituted *\"an integral part of Suez\u2019s investment\"* does not necessarily indicate that the Tribunal considered the fees a return on investment, as claimed by Respondent. More specifically, the Committee considers that this finding did not relate to the classification of the management fees as questioned by Dr. Deep but rather to Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional argument discussed above, *i.e.,* that the Management Contract was not a protected investment under the BIT and that the Tribunal would have had to make such determination at an earlier stage.\n\n413.\n\nIt is also important to recall that the determination of the legal nature of the fees was not an end in itself and that this issue gained relevance only by virtue of Dr. Deep\u2019s statement that a classification as a return on investment would *\"compromise the logic of using benchmarks\"* to arrive at a fair rate of return of AASA and thus the calculation he had provided on Claimants\u2019 equity stakes.414 Consequently, the Committee does not consider it decisive that the Tribunal did not explicitly answer the questions raised by Dr. Deep in his Final Report and, in particular, failed to make an express determination on the fees\u2019 legal nature. The Tribunal explicitly recognized that Dr. Deep had been *\"unsure of the legal status\"* of Suez\u2019s claim and had therefore computed it *\"on a contingent basis\"415* As the Tribunal then expressly adopted Dr. Deep\u2019s calculation made on this basis (except for one assumption in the context of actualizing the claim with which it disagreed), it can reasonably be inferred that the Tribunal (implicitly) also followed Dr. Deep\u2019s *\"contingent\"* classification as a payment for services.\n\n*Cf.* **Exhibit A/C-34, \u00b6** 429.\n\nAward, \u00b6 74.\n\n414.\n\nConsequently, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers nor did it fail to state reasons for its decision to award to Suez separate damages for unpaid management fees as of 2002 up to the end of the concession period in 2023.\n\n**4. Conclusion**\n-----------------\n\n415.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee finds that Respondent did not establish that the Tribunal committed an annullable error in its assessment of damages, more specifically, that it manifestly exceeded its powers or failed to state reasons for its decision. Consequently, Respondent\u2019s fourth annulment ground is dismissed.\n\n**E. Overall Conclusion**\n-------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe Committee has found that Respondent has failed to establish either of the four annulment grounds it advanced in its Application for Annulment. Consequently, Respondent\u2019s request for annulment of the Award as well as the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Decision on Liability, which are an integral part thereof, is denied.\n\n**VII. COST DECISION**\n----------------------\n\n**A. Argentina\u2019s Statement of Costs**\n-------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nPursuant to its Statement of Costs dated 2 December 2016, Respondent has incurred the following costs in connection with this annulment proceeding:\n\nTABLE\n\n**B. Claimants\u2019 Statement of Costs**\n------------------------------------\n\n418.\n\nPursuant to Annex A of their Statement of Costs dated 3 December 2016, Claimants have incurred the following total costs in connection with this annulment proceeding:\n\nTABLE\n\n419.\n\nPursuant to Annex B of Claimants\u2019 Statement of Costs, the total amount of USD 1,769,602.96 representing the fees and disbursements of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP includes the following disbursements:\n\n**Expenses Totals**\n\nTravel USD 12,116.34\n\nLegal Research USD 413.83\n\nCourier USD 6,730.16\n\nTranslations USD 16,582.99\n\nPrinting USD 18,776.56\n\n**Total USD 54,619.88**\n\n**C. Committee\u2019s Decision**\n---------------------------\n\n420.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Chapter VI of the Convention, including its Article 61(2), shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to the proceedings before this Committee. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid....\"*\n\n421.\n\nRegulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations further provides that in annulment proceedings:\n\n*\"... the applicant shall be solely responsible for making the advance payments requested by the Secretary-General to cover expenses following the constitution of the Committee, and without prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with Article 52(4) of the Convention to decide how and by whom expenses incurred in connection with the annulment proceeding shall be paid.\"*\n\n422.\n\nIn accordance with these provisions, Respondent, as the Party seeking annulment of the Award, has up to date been responsible for making all the advance payments to cover the costs of the Committee and the Centre. However, the Committee has discretion to decide on the final allocation of these costs of the proceeding, as well as of the costs incurred by the Parties in respect of their legal representation in this annulment proceeding.\n\n423.\n\nClaimants request that the Committee order Respondent to bear the costs of the proceeding as well as Claimants\u2019 legal costs and expenses in full based on the following arguments: (i) costs should presumptively follow the event in annulment proceedings - a presumption that has frequently been applied by annulment committees in the past; and (ii) Respondent should be discouraged from filing future *\"abusive\"* requests for annulment.416\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 178-184; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 130-134.\n\n424.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, requests that each Party should bear the costs incurred by them in relation to the proceeding and that the costs of the proceeding, including the fees payable to the members of the Committee, should be borne by both sides equally. Respondent presents the following arguments: (i) the present case *\"involves issues of undeniable complexity,\"* and in such cases, ICSID tribunals and committees that have heard disputes involving Argentina *\"have generally concluded\u2019* as requested by Respondent; and (ii) in filing its Application for Annulment, Respondent has exercised its legitimate right granted by the ICSID Convention, which is *\"far from constituting an act carried out in bad faith or an abusive conduct\"417*\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 221-226.\n\n425.\n\nIn respect of the allocation of costs, the Committee notes that the ICSID Background Paper on Annulment records the following development in recent ICSID jurisprudence:\n\n*\"... While* ad hoc *Committees in the past usually divided the Costs of Proceeding equally between the parties and ruled that each party bear its own legal fees and expenses, in recent years, a majority of Committees have decided that the Applicant should bear all or a majority of the Costs of Proceeding when the application for annulment was unsuccessful. Some* ad hoc *Committees have also ruled that the losing party should bear the legal fees and expenses of the successful party, in most instances the defending party.\u2019\u2019418*\n\n**A/CLA-91, \u00b6** 65.\n\n426.\n\nThe Committee further notes that both Parties refer in their submissions to the annulment decision in *CDC Group v. Seychelles,* where the committee held that it was appropriate to order the respondent as the unsuccessful applicant to bear the costs of the proceeding as well as the legal fees and expenses incurred by the claimant in connection with the annulment proceeding based on the following reasons:\n\n\"...[W]e *must be mindful of our determination, founded upon careful consideration of all arguments advanced by the parties in this proceeding, that the Republic\u2019s case before this Committee was fundamentally lacking in merit. While we refrain from going so far as to say that it was frivolous, we can state unequivocally that, taking into account the presumption of finality in ICSID arbitration and the restrictive grounds of challenge available in annulment process, the Republic\u2019s case was, to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed!'419*\n\n**AL A RA 53, \u00b6** 89.\n\n427.\n\nThe *CDC* committee\u2019s finding and the corresponding threshold for a cost order, *i.e.,* a case that is *\"fundamentally lacking in merit\"* and is, *\"to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed,\"* was also referred to, *e.g.,* by the committees in *EDF v. Argentina* and *Daimler v. Argentina.*420 At the same time, however, it has to be noted that both the *EDF* committee and the *Daimler* committee concluded, respectively, that, while this threshold was not met in the case they had to decide and each side thus was to bear the legal costs it incurred, Argentina was to bear the entire costs of the proceeding it had advanced because each of its annulment grounds was rejected.421\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6\u00b6** 389-390; **A/CLA-43, \u00b6** 309.\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 391; **A/CLA-43, \u00b6\u00b6** 306-307.\n\n428.\n\nThe same conclusion, distinguishing between costs of the proceeding and legal costs incurred by the parties, was reached by the committees in *Impregiio v. Argentina* and *El Paso* v. *Argentina* based on the consideration that, on the one hand, Argentina\u2019s application was rejected in its entirety but, on the other hand, its application could not be considered *\"frivolous\"* and in *El Paso,* the committee even considered that it was *\"entirely legitimate for Argentina to raise some of the issues in which it based its request for annulment of the Award.\"422*\n\n**A/CLA-42 / AL A RA 34, \u00b6** 221; **AL A RA 35, \u00b6** 290.\n\n429.\n\nThe Committee is aware that Respondent referred to four annulment decisions involving Argentina that ordered each side to bear its own legal costs and half of the costs of the proceeding, as requested by Respondent. In two of those cases, however, *i.e., Enron* and *CMS Gas,* the committees decided to partially annul the award, respectively.423 In a third case, *i.e., Continental Casualty,* the committee had to decide on applications for annulment from both sides and rejected both of them.424 Finally, the committee in *Vivendi II* indeed rejected Argentina\u2019s application and decided as requested by Respondent, albeit without giving any reasons for its decision on costs.425\n\n**AL A RA 33; AL A RA 31**\n\n**AL A RA 82, \u00b61285.**\n\n**AL A RA 67, \u00b6\u00b6** 268-269.\n\n430.\n\nHaving reviewed additional cases involving Argentina, the Committee notes that two other committees that heard annulment applications filed by Argentina and fully rejected them ordered Argentina to bear the entire costs of the proceeding, with each side bearing their own legal costs. Specifically, this was the case in *Total* and *Azurix.426* In addition, as noted in the ICSID Background Paper of Annulment, this approach has been applied more frequently in recent ICSID jurisprudence, including several cases that were discussed in this annulment proceeding, such as: *Tulip v. Turkey, Caratube v. Kazakhstan, SGS v. Paraguay, Libananco v. Turkey* and *Duke Energy v. Peru.427* At the same time, there are also cases in which the committees decided as requested by Respondent in the present case, in particular: *Occidental v. Ecuador, Rumeli v. Karakhstan* and *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates428*\n\n**A/CLA-68, \u00b6** 324; **AL A RA 84 / A/CLA-69, \u00b6\u00b6** 379-380.\n\n**A/CLA-90,** 230-231; **AL A RA 30, \u00b6** 307; **A/CLA-46, \u00b6** 153; **A/CLA-95, \u00b6\u00b6** 225-226; **A/CLA-31, \u00b6\u00b6** 265, 268.\n\n**AL A RA 90, \u00b6** 589; **A/CLA-32, \u00b6** 184; **AL A RA 61, \u00b6** 138.\n\n431.\n\nTaking into account the not yet settled ICSID jurisprudence on this issue, the Committee will now exercise its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention to decide on an appropriate allocation of costs in the present proceedings. In this regard, the Committee cannot agree with Claimants that Respondent\u2019s Application for Annulment *\"lacks even the slightest merits\"* and has to be considered *\"tactical\"* and *\"abusive\"429* In the Committee\u2019s view, such a conclusion cannot be drawn simply because Argentina has also filed annulment applications in other ICSID cases in which it has been involved. Considering that the ICSID Convention explicitly provides for the right to seek annulment and also taking into account that some of Argentina\u2019s applications have been (partially) successful, the Committee is not convinced that there is any illegitimacy in Respondent\u2019s motives to seek annulment in the present case and, specifically, that Respondent has advanced its Application for Annulment in bad faith or based on tactical, abusive considerations.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 178, 182; Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder, \u00b6 130.\n\n432.\n\nIn particular as regards the annulment ground advanced by Respondent in connection with the appointment of Prof. Kaufmann Kohler to the UBS Board of Directors, the Committee agrees with the cost consideration of the *EDF* committee, which had to decide on the same ground and based on very similar arguments, that Argentina\u2019s application was *\"advancedin good faith and... based on arguments that were generally plausible\"* Likewise, the Committee considers that the following consideration of the *EDF* committee is also justified in the present case: *\"[T]he fact that the Committee has dealt with Argentina\u2019s arguments at such length is an indication that it does not consider that they were doomed to failure from the outset\"430* The Committee also considers it noteworthy that the committee in *Vivendi II* v. *Argentina* expressed very specific concerns regarding the conduct of Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler that formed the basis of an annulment ground on which it had to decide.\n\n**AL A RA 70 / A/CLA-61, \u00b6** 390.\n\n433.\n\nAs indicated above, this Committee shares some of the concerns voiced by the *Vivendi II* committee and therefore concludes that Argentina\u2019s Application for Annulment cannot be considered to be *\"fundamentally lacking in merit\"* or, *\"to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed.\"* Exercising its discretion, the Committee thus sees no justification for ordering Respondent to bear the legal costs and expenses Claimants have incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n434.\n\nAs regards the costs of the proceeding, the Committee agrees with the recent trend in ICSID jurisprudence that it is generally reasonable for a party whose application has been rejected in its entirety to bear the costs of the proceeding in full. In the Committee\u2019s view, there are no special circumstances that would warrant a different conclusion in the present case. Therefore, the Committee decides that Respondent shall bear all costs of the proceeding, consisting of the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre. As Respondent has advanced the entire amount of the costs of the proceeding pursuant to Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, no reimbursement order is required.431\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\n**VIII. DECISION**\n------------------\n\n435.\n\nFor the reasons referred to above, the Committee issues the following decision:\n\n1. Respondent\u2019s request for annulment of the Award rendered on 9 April 2015, in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/19, *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. The Argentine Republic* is denied.\n\n2. Each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n3. Respondent shall bear the total costs of the proceeding, consisting of the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the ICSID facilities.\n\n4. All other requests by the Parties are dismissed."}]}
