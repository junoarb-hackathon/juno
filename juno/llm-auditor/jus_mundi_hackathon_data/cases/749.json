PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn September 19, 2001, the Claimant, Azurix Corp., a corporation incorporated in the State of Delaware of the United States of America (hereinafter \"Azurix\" or \"the Claimant\"), filed a request for arbitration against the Respondent, the Argentina Republic (hereinafter \"Argentina\" or \"the Respondent\"), with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter the \"Centre\"). Azurix claims that Argentina has violated obligations owed to Azurix under the 1991 Treaty Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment between the Argentine Republic and the United States of America (hereinafter \"the BIT\"; bilateral investment treaties in general will be referred to as BITs), international law and Argentine law in respect of Azurix\u2019s investment in a utility which distributes drinking water and treats and disposes of sewerage water in the Argentine Province of Buenos Aires. Azurix alleges such breaches were made by Argentina both directly through its own omissions and through the actions and omissions of its political subdivisions and instrumentalities.\n\n2.\n\nThe Secretary-General of the Centre registered Azurix\u2019s request for arbitration on October 23, 2001. On November 12, 2001, the parties agreed the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each party and the third arbitrator and President of the Tribunal to be appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the Centre. Accordingly, Sir Elihu Lauterpacht, C.B.E. Q.C. and Dr. Daniel H. Martins were appointed arbitrators by the parties and Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda was appointed President after consultation with the parties. On April 8, 2002, the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have commenced. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 25, the parties were notified that Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal. The Tribunal held its first session in Washington D.C. on May 16, 2002.\n\n3.\n\nMr. R. Doak Bishop of King & Spalding and Mr. Guido Santiago Tawil of M & M Bomchil represent the Claimant, and Mr. Bishop represented the Claimant at the first session. Dr. Horacio Daniel Rosatti, Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, represents the Respondent, and Mr. Hern\u00e1n Cruchaga and Ms. Andrea G. Gualde of the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires, acting on instruction from the then Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Dr. Ruben Miguel Citara, represented the Respondent at the first session.\n\n4.\n\nAt the first session, the parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and that they had no objection to any of the members of the Tribunal, and it was noted that the proceedings would be conducted under the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force since September 26, 1984 (hereinafter \"the Arbitration Rules\"). In respect of the pleadings to be filed by the parties, their number, sequence and timing, it was announced after consultation with the parties that the Claimant would file its Memorial within 150 days of the date of the first session, the Respondent would file its Counter-Memorial within 150 days of the date of receipt of the Memorial, the Claimant\u2019s Reply would be filed within 60 days of the date of receipt of the Counter-Memorial, and the Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder would be filed within a further 60 days of its receipt of the Reply. It was further noted by the Tribunal that, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules, the Respondent had the right to raise any objections it might have to jurisdiction no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for filing its Counter-Memorial. If such objection to jurisdiction were made by the Respondent, it was agreed that the above timetable would be resumed following the resumption of any proceedings on the merits.\n\n5.\n\nAzurix filed its Memorial on October 15, 2002, claiming that Argentina had breached the BIT by expropriating its investment by measures tantamount to expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation (Article IV(1)), by failing to accord to it fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, and treatment required by international law (Article Il(2)(a)), by taking arbitrary measures that impaired Azurix\u2019s use and enjoyment of its investment (Article Il(2)(b)), by failing to observe obligations Argentina entered into with regard to Azurix\u2019s investment (Article II(2(c)), and by failing to provide transparency concerning the regulations, administrative practices and procedures and adjudicatory decisions that affect Azurix\u2019s investment (Article II(7)). In addition, Azurix requested orders for the payment of compensation for all damages suffered and the adoption by Argentina of all necessary measures to avoid further damages to Azurix\u2019s investment. Azurix expressly reserved its right to request the decision of provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39.\n\n6.\n\nOn March 7, 2003, Argentina filed a Memorial on jurisdiction raising two objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The first was that Azurix agreed to submit this dispute to the courts of the city of La Plata and waived any other jurisdiction and forum; the second was that Azurix had already made a forum selection under Article VII of the BIT by submitting the dispute to Argentine courts.\n\n7.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(3), the Tribunal suspended the proceeding on the merits on March 12, 2002, and set dates for filing pleadings on jurisdiction: Azurix to file a Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction within 60 days of receipt of Argentina\u2019s Memorial on jurisdiction; Argentina to file a Reply with 30 days of receipt of the Counter-Memorial, and Azurix to file its Rejoinder within a further 30 days of receipt of Argentina\u2019s Reply.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter dated March 12, 2003, Azurix requested the Tribunal to join the jurisdictional issue to the merits. On March 21, 2003, the Tribunal invited Argentina to comment on this request. The Tribunal received Argentina\u2019s observations on March 27, 2003. Azurix replied to Argentina\u2019s observations on April 2, 2003, and the Tribunal confirmed, on April 4, 2003, that the proceedings on the merits would remain suspended until the jurisdictional issue had been addressed.\n\n9.\n\nAzurix filed its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction on May 13, 2003.\n\n10.\n\nOn June 10, 2003, Argentina requested an extension for filing its Reply on jurisdiction until August 4, 2003 because of the institutional succession in the Argentine government. Taking into account the circumstances, and after having given the Claimant an opportunity to comment on the request, the Tribunal granted it on June 16, 2003, and informed the parties that the Claimant would be entitled to an equivalent extension if requested.\n\n11.\n\nDr. Horacio Daniel Rosatti informed the Tribunal, on July 1, 2003, that he had been appointed Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n.\n\n12.\n\nAzurix filed a request for provisional measures on July 15, 2003 (dated July 14, 2003), subsequently supplemented by two letters dated July 21 and 28, 2003. The request sought a provisional measure recommending that Argentina refrain from incurring by itself or through any of its political subdivisions in any action or omission capable of aggravating or extending the dispute, taking into account especially the reorganization of Azurix\u2019s Argentine subsidiary, Azurix Buenos Aires S.A. (hereinafter \"ABA\"), or any other measure having the same effect.\n\n13.\n\nAt the request of the Tribunal, Argentina filed observations on Azurix\u2019s request for provisional measures on July 24, 2003, seeking dismissal of the request for provisional measures together with costs and requesting that the Tribunal request the Claimant to produce an original copy of the Decision of the Appeals Chamber of the Province of Buenos Aires.\n\n14.\n\nThe Tribunal, in a decision of August 6, 2003, rejected Azurix\u2019s request for provisional measures, considering that, in the circumstances of the case and at that stage of proceedings, it was not in a position to recommend the specific measure requested or to propose others with the same objective. The Tribunal did, however, invite the parties to abstain from adopting measures of any character which could aggravate or extend the controversy submitted to arbitration, and took note of statements made by Argentina affirming that the Province of Buenos Aires (hereinafter \"the Province\") recognizes that the receivables for services rendered by ABA before March 7, 2002 belong to ABA, and that those collected or to be collected in the future have been or will be deposited in a special banking account, and that the situation described in Azurix\u2019s request would not affect the enforceability or execution of any award rendered on the merits. The Tribunal postponed its decision on costs in respect of the provisional measures request to a later stage of the proceedings and considered it unnecessary to request the Claimant to furnish the Tribunal with the Decision of the Appeals Chamber.\n\n15.\n\nArgentina filed its Reply on jurisdiction on August 4, 2003. Azurix filed a Rejoinder on jurisdiction on August 29, 2003.\n\n16.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction took place in London on September 9 and 10, 2003. The parties were represented by Messrs. R. Doak Bishop, Guido Santiago Tawil, Ignacio Minorini Lima and Craig S. Miles, on behalf of the Claimant. Messrs. Carlos Ignacio Su\u00e1rez Anzorena, and Jorge Barraguirre, and Ms. Beatriz Pallares, from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, and Mr. Osvaldo Siseles, from the Secretar\u00eda Legal y Administrativa del Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Producci\u00f3n, represented the Respondent.\n\n17.\n\nAt the hearing, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal, should it decide that it has jurisdiction, increase to 90 days the deadline for the Respondent to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits. The President of the Tribunal invited the representatives of the Claimant to comment on the request. They opposed the request, having regard to the extensions already granted to the time periods agreed for the submission of memorials at the first session. During the hearing the Tribunal informed the parties that it took note of the request of the Respondent and the observations made by the Claimant and that it would decide this matter at a later date.\n\n18.\n\nOn October 14, 2003, the Tribunal followed up on the petition of Argentina under Article 1 of the Protocol of the BIT that the Claimant produce evidence of ownership or control of the investment consistent with Article I(1)(a) of the BIT. On October 21, 2003, the Claimant complied with the Tribunal\u2019s request.\n\n**II. THE FACTS**\n-----------------\n\n19.\n\nIn 1996 the Province commenced the privatization of the services of Administraci\u00f3n General de Obras Sanitarias de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (hereinafter \"AGOSBA\"), the Province owned and operated company which provided potable water and sewerage services in the Province. The Province passed Law 11,820 to create the regulatory framework for privatization of AGOSBA\u2019s water services. The future operator of the water services would be granted a concession which would be overseen and regulated by a new regulatory authority established for the purpose, Organismo Regulador de Aguas Bonaerense (hereinafter \"ORAB\"). The concessionaire was required to be a company incorporated in Argentina.\n\n20.\n\nThe privatization process was conducted by the Privatization Commission, which tendered the concession on the international market on the basis of Law 11,820 and of a set of contract documents prepared in accordance with the same law by ORAB, including the Bidding Terms and Conditions and a draft Concession Agreement.\n\n21.\n\nThe bid offer was made by two companies of the Azurix group of companies established for this specific purpose, Azurix AGOSBA S.R.L. (hereinafter \"AAS\") and Operadora de Buenos Aires S.R.L. (hereinafter \"OBA\"). AAS and OBA are indirect subsidiary companies of Azurix. AAS is registered in Argentina and is 0.1% owned by Azurix and 99.9% owned by Azurix Argentina Holdings Inc. (a company incorporated in Delaware), which in turn is 100% owned by Azurix. OBA, also registered in Argentina, is 100% owned by Azurix Agosba Limited which is registered in the Cayman Islands, and which is in turn 100% owned by Azurix Agosba Holdings Limited, also registered in the Cayman Islands. Azurix owns 100% of the shares in Azurix Agosba Holdings Limited.\n\n22.\n\nHaving successfully won their bid, AAS and OBA incorporated ABA in Argentina to act as concessionaire. On June 30, 1999, ABA paid a \"canon payment\" of 438,555,554 Argentinean pesos (hereinafter the \"Canon\") to the Province.1 On payment of the Canon, ABA, AGOSBA and the Province executed the Concession Agreement which granted ABA a 30 year concession for the distribution of potable water and the treatment and disposal of sewerage in the Province. Handover of the service took place on July 1, 1999.\n\nAt the time the Canon was paid the Argentine Peso was fixed in a one to one ratio with the United States dollar. The Argentine Peso was pegged to the US dollar until December 31, 2001, when \"pesification\" was implemented by Argentina in response to its economic crisis.\n\n**III. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n---------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent makes two principal objections to jurisdiction:\n\n***-Azurix agreed to the jurisdiction of the courts of La Plata over all disputes and waived all other fora: -*** all the contractual documentation relevant to the investment provides for the jurisdiction of the administrative courts of La Plata (provincial courts) and waives the jurisdiction of any other forum or jurisdiction, including that of an ICSID tribunal; and\n\n***-\"fork-in-the-road\" argument under Article VII of the BIT: -*** by its *alter ego* ABA, Azurix has made an election under Article VII of the BIT to submit the dispute to the jurisdiction of the local courts of the Argentine Republic by pursuing judicial review and legal proceedings in those fora.\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent also claims that the Claimant has no *ius standi* to bring this dispute before the Tribunal since it is an indirect shareholder of ABA.\n\n25.\n\nIn the course of arguing the two principal objections, the Respondent raises a number of incidental points, primarily in respect of assumed consequences if the Tribunal finds it has jurisdiction. These points appear to raise distinct issues not necessarily related to the objection headings under which they are made and therefore the Tribunal will address them separately.\n\n**1. First objection to jurisdiction - agreement to the jurisdiction of the courts of La Plata and waiver of all other fora**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nEach of the forum selection clauses in the contractual documentation relating to the investment provides for all disputes under or relating to the Concession Agreement to be submitted to the courts for contentious-administrative matters of the city of La Plata:\n\n-Clause 1.5.5 of the Bidding Terms and Conditions (hereinafter \"the Bidding Terms\"), \"Commitments\", provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts for contentious-administrative matters of the city of La Plata \"for all disputes that may arise out of the Bidding, waiving any other forum, jurisdiction or immunity that may correspond.\"2\n\n-Clause 2.16 of the Bidding Terms, \"Jurisdiction\", provides that the \"court for contentious-administrative matters of the city of La Plata shall have jurisdiction over all matters arising out of the Bidding, waiving any other forum, jurisdiction or immunity that may correspond.\"3\n\n-Clause 16.7 of the Concession Agreement provides that \"In the event of any dispute regarding the construction and execution of the Agreement, the Grantor [the Executive Authorities of the Province of Buenos Aires] and the Concessionaire [ABA] submit to the court for contentious-administrative matters of the city of La Plata, expressly waiving any other forum or jurisdiction that may correspond due to any reason.\"4\n\n-The Claimant itself agreed in the commitment letters titled \"Commitment and Guarantee of the Operator\u2019s Controlling Company\" and the \"Commitment Letter and Guarantee of the Group\u2019s Controlling Company\" (hereinafter \"the Commitment Letters\") that \"we submit to the jurisdiction of the courts... of the city of La Plata... in the event of any dispute arising out of the application or interpretation of these presents and expressly waive any other forum or jurisdiction.\"5\n\n-The Privatization Commission stated in Clarifying Circular 11(A) that the jurisdiction of any disputes between the parties is the courts of the city of La Plata, and clarified that the Bidding Terms expressly provide a waiver of any other forum or jurisdiction. The statement was made in response to the question of one bidder which, noting the jurisdiction clause in the Bidding Terms, requested clarification that Argentina would keep its commitments under BITs to which it is a party and which provide for international arbitration.6\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 34. (Emphasis in the original).\n\nIb\u00edd., para. 35. (Emphasis in the original).\n\nIbid., para. 38. (Emphasis in the original).\n\nIbid., paras. 39-45. (Emphasis in the original).\n\nIb\u00edd., paras. 46-48.\n\n27.\n\n(The Bidding Terms, the Concession Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Clarifying Circular 11(A) will hereinafter be referred to as the \"Contract Documents\").\n\n28.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with recent arbitral precedents7 which have held that contractual jurisdiction clauses do not preclude the jurisdiction of international tribunals under an international treaty on the grounds that they fail to recognize the *pacta sunt servanda* principle, and ignore the contract terms the parties have agreed to as well as Article 26 of the ICSID Convention \"which allows the agreement to the contrary regarding the presumption that all local remedies must not be exhausted.\"8\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija SA. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic.* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3) 16 *ICSID Rev.-FILJ* 641 (2001), *Salini Construttori S.p.A, et Italstrade S.p.A* v. *Kingdom of Morocco.* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4), Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, 129 *Journal de Droit International* (2002), and *Lanco International Inc.* v. *Argentine Republic.* Preliminary Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 December 1998, 5 *ICSID Rep.* 367 (hereinafter *Vivendi I. Salini* and *Lanco,* respectively), paras. 53 and ff of Argentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 58-59. Article 26 of the ICSID Convention provides that \"Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a condition of its consent to arbitration under this Convention\"\n\n29.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that, in any event, this case is distinguishable from the recent case law cited because of the express waiver of any forum other than the courts of the city of La Plata for issues related to the Concession Agreement, and such waiver includes the possibility of reference to international arbitration of a dispute under the Concession Agreement.9 The Claimant was aware of the scope of the agreed waiver.10 The Respondent refers to the Calvo Clause and argues, citing the late Judge Jessup, that rights under international law that pertain to an individual can be waived by the individual, that is, Azurix can and did waive its rights under the BIT. Argentina cites *Woodruff v. Venezuela* (hereinafter *Woodruff)11* and *North American Dredging Company of Texas v. United Mexican States* (hereinafter *North American Dredging)12* as authority supporting its argument that a specific waiver of jurisdiction in a contract overrides the jurisdiction of an international tribunal under a treaty, and that an individual can waive such rights, other than those relating to diplomatic protection and denial of justice.13\n\nIbid., para. 60.\n\nIbid., para. 61.\n\n*Woodruff v. Venezuela, R1AA,* volume IX, Hague ICJ Register, p. 213.\n\n*North American Dredging Company of Texas v. United Mexican States, R1AA,* volume IV, Hague ICJ Register, p. 26.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 62-73.\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the Claimant is bound by the terms of the Bidding Terms and Conditions and the Concession Agreement through its owned subsidiaries, AAS and OBA, which took part in the bidding because: (a) the companies \"were simply instrumentalities and constituted a simple *alter ego\";* (b) Azurix itself made written representations during the bidding process in the form of the Commitment Letters; and (c) Azurix acknowledged the \"direct connection\" by the wording it used in its Memorial.14\n\nIbid., paras. 55-57.\n\n31.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction the Claimant rejected Argentina\u2019s allegations. To summarize the Claimant\u2019s arguments, the jurisdiction and waiver provisions of the Contract Documents are limited to normal breach of contract claims and do not require submission of a BIT claim to local courts, and Argentina ignores the distinction between the host State party\u2019s obligations under a BIT in respect of an investment in that State and the obligations contained in the contract documentation underlying the investment.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimant continues: the terms of the jurisdiction clause in the Bidding Terms limit the jurisdiction clause to \"disputes arising under the Bidding Terms\", and \"Bidding\" is defined as the \"selection procedure that is governed by the Bidding Terms until the Concession Agreement is signed\", so the Terms no longer applied once the Concession Agreement entered into force.15 Similarly, the jurisdiction clause of the Concession Agreement applies to disputes regarding \"the construction and execution of the [Concession] Agreement\", that is, it does not apply to claims arising under the BIT.16 The Commitment Letters\u2019 jurisdiction provisions relate only to \"these presents\", i.e., the undertakings required to ensure that OBA had the requisite technical knowledge or access to it and that Azurix would abstain from changing the ownership structure of ABA for six years and keep the Province reasonably informed of changes in common control for a period of twelve years from the date of the Concession Agreement. The Commitment Letters did not bind Azurix to the Bidding Terms or the Concession Agreement.17\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 34-38.\n\nIbid., paras. 40-41.\n\nIbid., paras. 45-50.\n\n33.\n\nMoreover, there is no mutuality between the ABA\u2019s current claims before the local courts and Azurix\u2019s claim before the Tribunal under the Convention because both the claims and the parties are different: (i) the parties to the Bidding Terms are the Province, AAS and OBA, not Azurix and Argentina; (ii) the Commitment Letters signed by Azurix (the only Contract Documents signed by Azurix) were undertakings to ensure OBA complied with its obligations as the qualified technical operator under the Bidding Terms; (iii) Argentina is not a beneficiary of the undertakings given by Azurix in the Commitment Letters; and (iv) the Concession Agreement was signed by the Province, AGOSBA and ABA, the latter being the Argentine incorporated subsidiary appointed concessionaire under the Agreement as required by the Bidding Terms.18\n\nIb\u00edd., paras. 22-26.\n\n34.\n\nFurther, clarifying Circular 11(A) cannot have the effect attributed to it by Argentina because: (i) the Privatization Commission did not answer the question put to it; (ii) both the question and the answer related to the Bidding Terms only; (iii) any waiver of investment rights must be express and unequivocal (citing *North American Dredging)* and no such express and unequivocal waiver can be found in the question and answer in Circular 11(A); (iv) the provincial body which answered the question in Circular 11(A), the Privatization Commission, was unable to modify or repeal treaty commitments entered by Argentina; (v) treaties prevail over local regulations and the Province lacks the capacity to alter or rescind treaty obligations; and (vi) only Argentina can decide whether its constituent subdivisions or agencies may have standing before an ICSID tribunal, and no such designation was made by Argentina in respect of the Province.19\n\nIbid., paras. 54-80.\n\n35.\n\nAdditionally, under Argentina\u2019s constitutional structure, local provincial courts lack both subject matter and personal jurisdiction over the Federal Government to entertain BIT claims - only federal courts have such jurisdiction. Therefore, the scope of the choice of forum provisions is limited to contract claims.20 In any case, Azurix has the choice under Article VII.2(3) of the BIT to submit its dispute to ICSID or in accordance with any pre-agreed dispute settlement procedure.21\n\nIbid., paras. 82-89, and 91-92.\n\nIbid., paras. 93-101.\n\n36.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, ICSID tribunal decisions in *Lanco* and *Salini,* the award in *Vivendi I,* and the decisions of the *ad hoc* Committees in respect of *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (hereinafter *\"Vivendi II\")22* and *Wena Hotels Ltd v. Egypt23* support a finding of jurisdiction in this case.24\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee of July 3, 2002, 41 *ILM* 1135 (2002).\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd v. Egypt,* Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee of February 5, 2002, 41 *ILM* 933 (2002).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 102-148.\n\n**2. Second objection to jurisdiction - the dispute submitted by Azurix has already been submitted to the courts of Argentina under Article VII of the BIT (\"fork-in-the-road\" argument)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is excluded because Azurix has already submitted this dispute to the Argentine courts and thus exercised the jurisdictional option under Article VII of the BIT. Five administrative appeals (twelve since then)25 have been made by ABA and the dispute between the ABA and the Province over the termination of the Concession Agreement has been submitted to the Court of Justice of the Province. Further, Argentina claims that Azurix and ABA acknowledge in their pleadings in the case before that Court that the basis of the legal action is identical to that brought before the ICSID Tribunal.26\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 78-79 and footnote 69 in Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\nIbid., paras. 80-85.\n\n38.\n\nIn response, the Claimant alleges that Argentina overlooks the existence of causes of action before the Tribunal which are independent of the Concession Agreement and erroneously concludes that Azurix has submitted claims to administrative tribunals and provincial courts for the purposes of the BIT. Furthermore, the parties and subject matter of the proceedings before the Argentine courts and the Tribunal are not the same.27\n\nClaimant\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 154, 159 and ff.\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimant disputes that ORAB - the body hearing the administrative review claims - qualifies as a court or administrative tribunal for the purposes of Article VII of the BIT and Argentine law.28 ORAB was constituted as a regulator, not as a judicial body with power to determine disputes; and, in respect of ABA, it is only reviewing prior decisions it has made and is not acting as an impartial judicial body. Argentine federal courts have held that bodies constituted in the same way as ORAB lack the capacity to exercise judicial type functions, except in specific circumstances. Even where they do, the courts have been reluctant to label them as \"administrative tribunals\", and exercise of any such power is limited to disputes between private parties. In any case, Azurix\u2019s rights under the BIT were not involved in any way in the reviews.29\n\nIbid., para. 158.\n\nIbid., paras. 167-175.\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimant further alleges that the request for arbitration was filed with the Centre before the local court proceedings were initiated and therefore, under the terms of the jurisdiction provisions of the BIT, no choice of fora can be implied by Azurix\u2019s action.30 In any case, ABA filed the local action specifically to protect its position under provincial law.31 It has asked the court to abstain from pursuing the proceeding any further because Azurix has chosen to pursue arbitration under the BIT before an ICSID Tribunal32 although Azurix acknowledges that \"the BIT does not impose any requirement on ABA to waive or suspend its claims before local courts in order for Azurix to pursue its separate and independent claims for violations of the BIT before ICSID\".33 In any case, ABA is obligated under the relevant company legislation to take all possible legal action necessary to protect its shareholders.34\n\nIbid., paras. 180-182. See also footnote 69 in Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction for a list of cases before the Supreme Court of the Province.\n\nIbid., para. 183.\n\nIbid., paras. 183-186.\n\nIbid., para. 198.\n\nIbid., paras. 187-188.\n\n41.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina\u2019s reply to Azurix\u2019s arguments in so far as it raises new points not previously made by Argentina, can be summarized as follows:\n\n-Azurix\u2019s assertion that the Province cannot limit or modify any international agreement is basically true but it is irrelevant because Azurix was free to contract out of its rights (by way of waiver) as an investor under the BIT, which it did. The possibility of such a waiver has been acknowledged by the *Ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi II.* Argentina has not alleged that Azurix has waived the ICSID jurisdiction as such, but that it has \"waived the right to put forward controversies in terms of said investments related to the interpretation and performance before the forums set forth under the Treaty\" and this cannot be recast by Azurix as a refusal to apply the law by Argentina (because the Provincial courts do not have jurisdiction over Argentina). In any case, Azurix has a remedy through ABA using the mechanisms in the Concession Agreement.35\n\n-Argentina refutes Azurix\u2019s claim that the court actions before the Province were exclusively aimed at protecting its legal position because:\n\n(i) ABA is requesting an order nullifying ORAB\u2019s regulatory decisions;\n\n(ii) the filings before both tribunals are identical as to their substance; and\n\n(iii) ABA is not protecting its shareholders.36\n\nArgentina\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 93-108.\n\nIbid., paras. 128-131.\n\n**3. Azurix does not have** ***ius standi***\n--------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina has raised, as a subsidiary objection that, if Azurix is not one and the same personality as ABA - in which case it would be a party to ABA\u2019s agreements as to jurisdiction of the courts of La Plata and the waiver of other dispute settlement fora - then it is only a shareholder of ABA with no *ius standi* to bring this dispute under the BIT. Argentina is claiming that Azurix is \"trying to have it both ways\": Azurix is \"washing its hands\" of its subsidiaries\u2019 obligations by using the BIT to penetrate the juridical personalities of the local companies yet also attempting to cut loose from the jurisdictional commitments entered by those companies on the basis of its separate legal identity. In Argentina\u2019s view, Azurix\u2019s subsidiaries are *alter egos* and, therefore, it cannot cut itself free of the contractual commitments entered by those companies.37\n\nIbid., paras. 3-4, 16.\n\n43.\n\nIf, on the other hand, Azurix is only a shareholder of ABA, it lacks *ius standi* to put forward indirect claims relating to such company\u2019s contractual rights. Argentina notes in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction that in general BITs have not modified the rule that shareholders are not entitled to bring claims for damages suffered by the company in which they have shares (indirect claims). Argentina argues that under Articles l(a)(ii), II(4) and VII(8) of the BIT the local companies are an investment and can be parties to ICSID procedures. If Azurix does not argue that ABA is an \"investment\" within the BIT definitions, then its only investment is the shares in ABA and, accordingly, it has no *ius standi* to claim for damages sustained by ABA for alleged breaches of contract.38\n\nIb\u00edd., paras. 9 and 14.\n\n44.\n\nIn response, Azurix claims that, under Arbitration Rule 41, the *ius standi* objection should have been first raised by Argentina in its Memorial on jurisdiction and, therefore, it is untimely. Any entitlement Argentina had to raise the objection was waived when it failed to do so.39 Nonetheless, Azurix rejects these contentions, relying on the terms of the Convention and the BIT to show that it has standing to bring this dispute before the Tribunal.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 14-20.\n\n**4. Additional consequences alleged by Argentina**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nIn addition to the arguments outlined above, Argentina makes a number of additional points which, because they do not obviously fall under the objections of *ius standi* headings, the Tribunal will deal with them separately. Most of the points made are assumed consequences of the Tribunal finding that it has jurisdiction. The Tribunal summarizes these points as follows:\n\n-The Tribunal is forum *non conveniens* for the Province and could entail the denial of justice to the Province which is not a party to the proceeding and is also a creditor of ABA.40\n\n-The possible adverse economic impacts of Azurix\u2019s overall strategy, *inter alia.* ABA is making itself insolvent to the detriment of its creditors such as the Province; ABA\u2019s receivables in respect of its debtors and creditors, including the Province, have been pesified, yet Azurix formulates its claims in US dollars.41\n\n-Azurix prevents ABA from exercising its rights under the Concession Agreement before local courts and brings a claim before an arbitration tribunal to its own benefit and by doing so is ignoring the rights of ABA\u2019s other shareholders who, due to Azurix\u2019s actions, are not going to have the chance to be granted a remedy42\n\n-It is impossible for this Tribunal to resolve the dispute without deciding the scope of ABA\u2019s and the Province\u2019s rights under the Concession Agreement or performing regulatory functions by undertaking the task of judicial review of the decisions of the regulatory agencies of the Province and Argentina43\n\n-The proceedings initiated by Azurix and ABA before different fora constitute an abuse of process44\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 77.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 30-34.\n\nIbid., para. 35.\n\nIbid., paras. 38-39.\n\nIbid., paras. 144-145.\n\n**5 Additional request**\n------------------------\n\n46.\n\nDuring the hearing on jurisdiction the Respondent made an additional request that the Tribunal consider suspending this proceeding until the Supreme Court of the Province has decided the case before it45\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction, September 9-10, 2003, Transcripts of September 10, 2003, p. 11.\n\n**IV. APPLICABLE LAW**\n----------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn its Memorial, Azurix\u2019s affirmed that, since the parties have not chosen the applicable law to the dispute under Article 42(1) of the Convention, the law applicable to this dispute is international law because the BIT is itself the governing law as *lex specialis* between the parties and it expressly requires Argentina to comply with international law.46 According to Argentina, under Article 42(1) of the Convention, the law applicable to the dispute is primarily Argentine law which is the law applicable to the contractual and provincial administrative issues underlying Azurix\u2019s claim. In Argentina\u2019s view, the BIT is the point of reference to establish the merits of Argentina\u2019s obligations regarding Azurix\u2019s investment, and international law from unconventional sources is relevant provided that reference to it is made in the BIT or if it is relevant for the interpretation of the BIT or is incorporated into the law of Argentina.47\n\nClaimant\u2019s Memorial, pp. 149-156.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 13-15.\n\n48.\n\nAs pointed out by both parties, the relevant provision for determining the law applicable to this dispute is Article 42(1) of the Convention. However, the rules applying to the dispute under Article 42(1) address the resolution of disputes on the merits, and so will not necessarily be those which apply to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of its jurisdiction under Article 41 at this stage of the proceedings.48\n\nSee also *CMS v. Argentina,* paras. 88-89.\n\n49.\n\nArticle 41 of the Convention provides that the Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence, and any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal. Article 41 does not state what the applicable law rules are for the determination of the Tribunal\u2019s competence over the dispute as opposed to those applicable to the dispute itself.\n\n50.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre is determined by Article 25 of the Convention. In addition, the competence of the Tribunal is governed by the terms of the instrument expressing the parties\u2019 consent to ICSID arbitration. Therefore, the task of the Tribunal is to assess whether the Claimant\u2019s request for arbitration falls within the terms of said Article 25 of the Convention and Article VII of the BIT.\n\n**V. CONSIDERATIONS**\n---------------------\n\n**1. Preliminary Considerations**\n---------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal will first review the threshold conditions under the Convention and the BIT that a claim needs to meet for purposes of the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal, whether or not said conditions have been subject of controversy between the parties.\n\n52.\n\nFor this purpose, it is useful to recall the key provisions, Article 25 of the Convention and Article VII of the BIT, on which the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of this Tribunal rest. Article 25 provides:\n\n(1) \"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \"National of another Contracting State\" means:\n\nany natural person who had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration as well as on the date on which the request was registered pursuant to paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph (3) of Article 36, but does not include any person who on either date also had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute; and\n\nany juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.\n\n(3) Consent by a constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State shall require the approval of that State unless that State notifies the Centre that no such approval is required.\n\n(4) Any Contracting State may, at the time of ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention or at any time thereafter, notify the Centre of the class or classes of disputes which it would or would not consider submitting to the jurisdiction of the Centre. The Secretary-General shall forthwith transmit such notification to all Contracting States. Such notification shall not constitute the consent required by paragraph (1).\"\n\nArticle VII of the BIT reads as follows:\n\n1. \"For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to (a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company; (b) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment authority (if any such authorization exists) to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.\n\n2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the dispute for resolution:\n\n(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the dispute; or\n\n(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement procedure; or\n\n(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.\n\n3.\n\n(a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:\n\n(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"Centre\") established by the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at Washington, March 18, 1965 (\"ICSID Convention\"), provided that the Party is a party to such convention...\"\n\n53.\n\nIt will also be helpful to reproduce here the definition of \"investment\" agreed in the BIT. The term \"investment\" is defined in Article 1.1(a) as meaning:\n\n\"every kind of investment in the territory of one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and includes without limitation:\n\n(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges;\n\n(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or interests in the assets thereof;\n\n(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value and directly related to an investment;\n\n(iv) intellectual property... ; and\n\n(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law.\"\n\n54.\n\nBefore considering the specific objections to jurisdiction, the Tribunal will first address whether an attempt was made to reach an amicable settlement of the dispute within the first six months after it arose as required by Article VII(3) of the BIT, and then will consider the requirements of consent to ICSID jurisdiction: \"national of another Contracting Party\", \"legal dispute\", and \"dispute arising directly out of an investment\".\n\n**a) Attempt at amicable settlement**\n-------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nUnder paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article VII of the BIT the parties to the dispute should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation and the national or company concerned may have recourse to arbitration only after six months from the date that the dispute arose. The Claimant delivered notice of the existence of an investment dispute under the BIT to the President of the Argentine Republic on January 11, 2001.49 According to the Arbitration Request, dated September 19, 2001, Azurix pleaded repeatedly for assistance from the Respondent.50 The Argentine Republic responded on September 5, 2001 disclaiming the existence of an investment dispute or attribution of responsibility for the acts of the Province.51 The Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant attempted to resolve the dispute through consultation or negotiation and failed.\n\nExhibit 178 to the Arbitration Request.\n\nIbid. Exhibits 179 and 180\n\nIbid. Exhibit 182.\n\n**b) Consent by the parties to the jurisdiction of ICSID**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nArticle VII.4(a) of the BIT embodies the consent of the parties to the BIT - the US and Argentina - to the submission of any investment dispute to binding arbitration in accordance with the choice of the national or company in question, and further provides that such consent satisfies the requirement for written consent for purposes of Chapter II of the Convention. Argentina signed the Convention on May 21, 1991, and the ICSID Convention came into force in respect of Argentina on November 18, 1994. The open invitation provided by the parties to the BIT to investors to settle their claims, *inter alia,* through arbitration, has been taken up by the Claimant by its letter, dated July 12, 2001,52 to the Respondent and the Secretary General of the Centre consenting to ICSID jurisdiction. Furthermore, the filing of the request for arbitration is by itself sufficient evidence of the Claimant\u2019s consent. Therefore, the Tribunal is satisfied that both parties to the dispute have consented to ICSID jurisdiction.\n\nIbid. Exhibit 181.\n\n**c) National of another Contracting Party**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant is a company incorporated in the United States of America (the Convention came into force in respect of the United States of America on October 14, 1966). As already noted, the Respondent, Argentina, is a Contracting Party. The Tribunal is satisfied with the evidence presented by the Claimant establishing its nationality and that, as required by the BIT, it is not controlled by nationals of third parties.\n\n**d) Legal dispute**\n--------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe dispute as raised by the Claimant - an alleged breach by Argentina of obligations owed by it to Azurix under the BIT - is a legal dispute which, in the words of the Report of the Executive Directors of the World Bank on the Convention, concerns \"the existence or scope of a legal right or obligation, or the nature or extent of the reparation to be made for breach of a legal obligation, and is more than a mere \u2018conflict of interest.\u2019\"\n\n**e) Dispute arising directly out of an investment**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nWhat constitutes Azurix\u2019s \"investment\" has been a matter of controversy between the parties. For the Claimant, the dispute arises directly from an investment made in Argentina consisting of \"Azurix\u2019s payment of its US$438.6 million canon (which constitutes invested capital), its ownership interest and investment in ABA, and the rights in the Concession Agreement, all of which are investments under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\"53 On the other hand, the Respondent claims that the dispute is a contractual dispute related to the Concession Agreement. According to the Respondent, \"The Concession Agreement is neither and[sic] investment agreement, an agreement for economic development, nor an international contract.\"54 Furthermore, only the Province may be party to such contractual dispute since \"the Argentine Republic is not a party to such a Concession Agreement, neither has it guaranteed in any way whatsoever the fulfillment of the contractual obligations of the Province. The Argentine Republic is a federal state and the Province has broad powers to assume the obligations it assumed under the Concession Agreement.\"55 Therefore, the Tribunal needs to consider whether the investment as defined by the Claimant qualifies as an investment for purposes of the BIT and whether the dispute between the parties to these proceedings is directly related to it.\n\nAzurix\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 6(ii).\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 11.\n\nIbid., para. 12.\n\n60.\n\nThe Respondent admits that \"The definition of investment in the Treaty allows a local company to qualify as an *investment* and that such company be a party to an ICSID arbitral procedure\"56. The Respondent also considers that \"it is clear that the local companies that AZURIX used to take part in the bidding process, and even ABA - the company that signed the Concession Contract - qualify as *investment* according to the Treaty and could be party to an ICSID procedure.\"57 However, the Respondent finds that the Claimant has failed to clarify this issue and concludes that, as defined by AZURIX in the Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \"AZURIX considers that its investment consists of i) 90% of the ABA shares and ii) the rights provided for in the Concession Contract. AZURIX does not allege that ABA qualifies as an investment pursuant to the Treaty definitions. Nor is ABA part of the present arbitration procedure.\"58\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, heading Il.b). (Emphasis in the original).\n\nIbid., para. 9. (Emphasis in the original).\n\nIbid., para. 11. (Emphasis in the original).\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent also maintains that, according to the BIT, \"the rights arising from the Concession Contract qualify as an investment of AZURIX if they are... rights on some operation that has economic value and that is directly related to an investment \"59. In this case, the requirement is met only if ABA is an investment To qualify as an investment, the rights conferred by law or contract are \"an *investment* to the extent that they are held by a company that qualifies as an *investor* (national or company of one of the contracting parties) - which does not occur in this case -, or that they are under the direct or indirect control of an *investor.* But with respect to the latter - what does, indeed, occur in the present case -, the local company has to be controlled by the *investor* and hence to be an *investment\".* As a result, since Azurix alleges that ABA and the other subsidiaries are not an investment, then the contractual rights under the Concession are not an investment protected under the BIT.60\n\nIb\u00edd., para. 12. (Emphasis in the original).\n\nIbid., paras. 13 and 14. (Emphasis in the original).\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal finds difficulty in following the Respondent\u2019s reasoning on the basis of the definition of investment in Article 1.1(a) of the BIT. First, a concession contract, such as that entered by ABA with the Province, qualifies as an investment for purposes of the BIT given the wide meaning conferred upon this term in the BIT that includes \"any right conferred by law or contract\".61 The Concession Agreement itself refers repeatedly to investments. For instance, in the context of the determination of the tariff level, the Concession Agreement refers to \"a reasonable return on the amounts *invested* by the Concessionaire\"62, and \"the Concessionaire does hereby undertake to make all necessary *investments* to execute..,\"63\n\nArticle I.l.(a)(v).\n\nClause 12.1.1 of the Concession Agreement. (Emphasis added).\n\nIbid., Clause 7.8. (Emphasis added).\n\n63.\n\nSecond, the Respondent bases in part its argument on sub-paragraph (iii) of the definition which requires a claim to money or a claim to performance to have economic value and to be \"directly related to an investment\"64. The definition of investment lists a \"company\", \"shares of stock\" and, in a separate category, \"any right conferred by law or contract\". A company, shares held in a company or rights under a contract, any contract, qualify as an investment. Provided the direct or indirect ownership or control is established, rights under a contract held by a local company constitute an investment protected by the BIT. The definition in Article 1.1(a) simply lists examples of what an investment is, the list is not exhaustive and each item is independent from each other. The only condition is that, whatever the form an investment may take, it must be directly or indirectly owned or controlled by nationals or companies of the other party to the BIT65.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply on jurisdiction, para. 12. (Emphasis in the original).\n\nThe purpose of the definition as explained by the drafter is, *inter alia,* not to distinguish \"between investment owned or controlled directly and that owned or controlled through corporate tiers\" and to ensure that \"local subsidiaries *per se* are covered investment. Further, the company need not be wholly owned by the investor. Any ownership or other interest in a company would be considered investment.\" Kenneth J. Vandevelde, *United States Investment Treaties. Policy and Practice* (1992) pp. 45-46.\n\n64.\n\nAzurix made an investment by paying a \"canon\" to obtain the concession to provide water and wastewater services to the Province.66 To carry out the investment, Azurix organized several subsidiaries, as required by the Bidding Terms, and established a locally registered company in Argentina, ABA. The objective of the definition of investment in the BIT is precisely to include this type of structure established for the exclusive purpose of the investment in order to protect the real party in interest. In commenting on the reference to foreign control in Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention, the tribunal in *CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentina* (hereinafter *CMS)67* stated that \"foreign control in terms of treating a company of the nationality of the Contracting State party as a national of another Contracting State is precisely meant to facilitate agreement between the parties, so as not to have the corporate personality interfering with the protection of the real interests associated with the investment \"68.\n\nAzurix\u2019s Memorial at 1.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8). Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of July 17, 2003, 42 /LM 800.\n\nIbid, para. 51. (Emphasis added).\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal is satisfied that the investment described by Claimant in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction is an investment protected under the terms of the BIT and the Convention: (a) Azurix indirectly owns 90% of the shareholding in ABA, (b) Azurix indirectly controls ABA, and (c) ABA is party to the Concession Agreement and was established for the specific purpose of signing the Concession Agreement as required by the Bidding Terms.\n\n66.\n\nHaving determined that the Claimant\u2019s investment is an investment protected by the BIT, the Tribunal concludes that the dispute as presented by the Claimant is a dispute arising directly from that investment.\n\n**2.** ***lus standi***\n-----------------------\n\n67.\n\nThe Respondent introduced a new objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in its Reply on Jurisdiction alleging that Azurix has no standing to assert rights that arise from the Concession. According to the Respondent, only ABA could assert these rights and ABA is not a party to these proceedings. The Claimant has requested the Tribunal to reject this objection on the basis that it is untimely and has been waived pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(1). The Respondent, during the hearing on jurisdiction, justified the timing of the objection on the basis of the allegations made by the Claimant in its Counter-memorial on Jurisdiction. Only then did it become evident that the Claimant was trying to avoid by all means the commitments assumed by itself and the companies controlled by it while at the same time availing itself of the rights of the local companies.69\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 3 and 146.\n\n68.\n\nWhile the Tribunal agrees that the objection has been filed out of time, it considers that the issues it raises are such that they should be considered upon at the Tribunal\u2019s own initiative under Arbitration Rule 4l(2)70. The Tribunal is assisted in its consideration by the fact that this point has been fully argued by the parties since the Claimant responded \"out of an abundance of caution.\"71\n\nArbitration Rule 41(2) provides: \"The Tribunal may on its own initiative consider, at any stage of the proceeding, whether the dispute or any ancillary claim before it is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and within its own competence.\"\n\nAzurix\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para. 21.\n\n69.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, \"If the treaty allows the judicial penetration of the local entity in order to attribute the rights of said entity to the controlling shareholder, the obligations undertaken must be then assigned on the same basis.\"72 The Respondent has no doubt that an investor in shares has standing to activate dispute settlement mechanisms under BITs in \"cases of acts by the host state that affect it directly\"73 but, because the shareholders and the corporation have distinct legal personality, \"it is a different situation when a shareholder brings a claim related to assets or situations concerning the company it has shares in... The issue is not related either to the investor qualification of the claimant, nor to the investment qualification of the shares, but to claimant\u2019s standing or *ius standi* in respect of certain situations.\"74\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 146.\n\nIbid., para. 148.\n\nIbid., para. 149.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent bases its argument primarily on the decision of the International Court of Justice (hereinafter \"ICJ\") in *Barcelona Traction Light and Power Company Limited (Belgium v. Spain)* (hereinafter *Barcelona Traction)75* which it considers a statement of customary international law on this matter. The Respondent admits that BITs include clauses that extend the scope of operation of the treaty to create an exception of conventional nature which overcomes \"the lack of *ius standi* of the shareholders to file indirect claims.\"76 When \"the local company controlled by the investor also qualifies as investor, the *ius standi* obstacle for indirect claims is surpassed with the possibility that [sic] local company be the one to allege the existence of an infringement of the Treaty. In these cases, investment treaties allow to turn an indirect claim into a direct one.\"77\n\n*Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited* (New Application, 1962), Judgment 5 February 1970 (Reports 1970, p. 3).\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 153.\n\nIb\u00edd., para. 152.\n\n71.\n\nThe Claimant has pointed out that the decision in *Barcelona Traction* has been widely criticized as being an incorrect statement of customary international law and that the ICJ\u2019s decision did not examine whether international law provided an independent source of rights and protections of shareholders but only whether a State could protect its shareholders in a foreign corporation affected by measures of a third State78 The ICJ considered it likely that the State of the shareholders has a right of diplomatic protection when the State whose responsibility is invoked is the national State of the company. The ICJ also noted developments of investor protection through treaty stipulations whereby companies are themselves vested with a direct right to defend their interests against States. More recently, in *Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI) (United States of America v. Italy)*,79 the ICJ accepted the protection of foreign shareholders by the State of their nationality against the State of incorporation. The jurisdiction of the Id in this case was based on the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between the United States of America and Italy, a category of treaties which are the direct precursor of BITs.\n\nAzurix\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras. 24-27.\n\n*Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI),* Judgment 20 July 1989 *(Reports* 1989, p. 15).\n\n72.\n\nThe issues before this Tribunal concern not diplomatic protection under customary international law but the rights of investors, including shareholders, as determined by treaty, namely, under the BIT. The Tribunal does not find it necessary to resolve the controversy regarding the extent of the right of a State under public international law to protect its nationals who are shareholders in foreign companies.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found that given the wide meaning of investment in the definition in Article 1.1(a), the provisions of the BIT protect indirect claims. This conclusion, based on an analysis of the text of the provision, concurs with decisions of tribunals that have interpreted the same provision in the same BIT or similar provisions in other BITs to which Respondent is a party and that have been referred to by the parties in their pleadings. Thus in *CMS* the tribunal concluded that \"jurisdiction can be established under the terms of the specific provision of the BIT. Whether the protected investor is in addition a party to a concession agreement or a license agreement with the host State is immaterial for the purpose of finding jurisdiction under those treaty provisions, since *there is a direct right of action of shareholders\".80*\n\nIbid., para. 65. (Emphasis added)\n\n74.\n\nWe conclude the discussion on *ius standi* by affirming the *ius standi* of Azurix in these proceedings: Azurix is the investor that made the investment through indirectly owned and controlled subsidiaries. Whether this conclusion binds Azurix to the commitments made by its subsidiaries, as argued by the Respondent, is the subject of the consideration of the first objection to jurisdiction - to which we now turn.\n\n**3. First objection to jurisdiction - agreement to the jurisdiction of the courts of LaPlata and waiver of all other fora**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent bases this objection on the nature of the dispute and the scope of commitments made by the Claimant under the provisions of the Bidding Terms, the Concession Agreement, the Commitment Letters and the Clarifying Circular 11(A).\n\n76.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the dispute is of a contractual nature and related to the interpretation of and performance under the Concession Agreement. However, for purposes of determining its jurisdiction, the Tribunal should consider whether the dispute, as it has been presented by the Claimant, is *prima facie* a dispute arising under the BIT. The investment dispute which the Claimant has put before this Tribunal invokes obligations owed by the Respondent to Claimant under the BIT and it is based on a different cause of action from a claim under the Contract Documents. Even if the dispute as presented by the Claimant may involve the interpretation or analysis of facts related to performance under the Concession Agreement, the Tribunal considers that, to the extent that such issues are relevant to a breach of the obligations of the Respondent under the BIT, they cannot *per se* transform the dispute under the BIT into a contractual dispute. This follows from the scope of the jurisdiction clauses in the Contract Documents and the identity of the parties to whom the commitments were made.\n\n77.\n\nThe scope of the jurisdiction and waiver of any other forum clauses, whether included in the Bidding Terms, the Concession Agreement or the Commitment Letters, indicates that such clauses relate to disputes under the terms of the document concerned and between the parties to that particular document. Understandably, the Respondent is consistent with its conception of the dispute as a contractual dispute when it maintains that these clauses exclude claims against itself. However, Azurix has not filed with this Tribunal a claim against any of the parties to the Contract Documents but against the Respondent. The Respondent itself has stated repeatedly in this proceeding that it is not party to any of the Contract Documents.\n\n78.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the existence of the waiver in addition to the forum selection clause distinguishes this case from other ICSID cases where tribunals have held that a forum selection clause in the Contract Documents underlying the investment referring to the domestic courts of the State party does not preclude the jurisdiction of an ICSID tribunal. In particular, the Respondent has pointed out that said provision was added to the Contract Documents in light of the decisions in *Lanco* and *Vivendi I* precisely to avoid the situation in which the Respondent finds itself now.81\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction, September 9-10, 2003, Transcripts of September 9, 2003, p. 18 and ff.\n\n79.\n\nThe tribunals in the cases cited concluded that such forum selection clauses did not exclude their jurisdiction because the subject-matter of any proceedings before the domestic courts under the contractual arrangements in question and the dispute before the ICSID tribunal was different and therefore the forum selection clauses did not apply. This reasoning applies equally to the waiver of jurisdiction clause in this case. The claims or causes of action before this Tribunal are different in nature from any claims which ABA could bring before the courts of the city of La Plata under the Contract Documents.\n\n80.\n\nAs already noted, the Respondent has indicated that the specific waiver words in the clause were included precisely to avoid that claims under the Contract Documents would be brought to the venues for settlement provided under the BIT. The Tribunal finds that the addition of the waiver has not made a substantive difference to the exclusive forum clause included in the concessions agreements considered by ICSID tribunals in *Lanco* or *Vivendi I,* since the acceptance of the exclusivity of a forum implies by definition the renunciation of any other fora whether or not explicitly stated in the clause.\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimant has contended that the waiver, as understood by the Respondent, would mean that the Claimant would be deprived of recourse since the courts of La Plata would not be competent to consider claims against the Respondent. The Respondent considers this not to be the case: \"the Argentine Republic has not alleged that AZURIX had waived the ICSID jurisdiction, but it has alleged that it [Azurix] had waived the right to put forward controversies in terms of investments related to the interpretation and performance before the forums set forth under the Treaty\" and \"AZURIX aims to create the impression that the non-availability of the ICSID jurisdiction implies bringing plaintiff to a deadlock for the defense of its rights. That is not correct. ABA, and therefore AZURIX, have useful [sic] and expressly agreed upon remedies to its disposal in order to enforce the same rights relative to the Concession Contract as those claimed in this proceeding.\"82 The point is that the rights under the Concession Agreement and under the BIT are not the same and that the generality of the waiver would exclude even the courts at the federal level which would normally be competent to consider claims against the Respondent.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 105 and 108, respectively.\n\n82.\n\nThe scope of the waiver has also been discussed by the parties in the context of the Clarifying Circular 11(A). The Respondent attributes to this Circular great significance in terms of explaining to the prospective bidders for the concession that they were waiving their rights to arbitration under the BIT. While this was the question that the Privatization Commission was asked, its response seems to have avoided the answer and, in fact, repeated the terms of the clause to be clarified rather than clarifying it. At best, the Commission\u2019s reply is ambiguous.\n\n83.\n\nThe validity of the waiver under international law has also been a matter of extensive discussion by the parties. It has been alleged by the Respondent that now that individuals have rights recognized under international law as direct subjects of international law they may renounce to such rights. The Respondent has urged that \"the legal situation arising as a consequence of AZURIX\u2019s claim holds certain similarities with those issues already resolved on the validity of the \u2018Calvo clause.\u2019\"83 The Respondent argues that the criticism of this clause was based on the fact that it implied a waiver by individuals of a right that belonged to their national States: \"Accordingly the United States has consistently maintained that the individual could not waive a right which was not his but was the right of his state. Under the hypothesis that it is the individual himself who has rights under international law, this basic objection loses all logical force. The rights which appertain to the individual may be waived by the individual.\"84 This leads the Respondent to the conclusion that \"Since investment treaties regulate and protect merely economic interests, and considering the broad-spectrum of options available to investor [sic] to enforce this type of rights, there can be no doubts on the possibility to waive the right to bring investment disputes in general, or at least, before this international arbitration tribunal.\"85\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras. 62 and ff.\n\nIb\u00edd., quote from Judge Jessup in para. 64.\n\nIbid., para. 66.\n\n84.\n\nThe Respondent further supports its argument by reference to the decisions of the United States of America-Venezuela and United States of America-Mexico Claims Commissions in *Woodruff86* and *North American Dredging,87* respectively. In both cases the Commissions recognized the waiver in contracts signed by the claimant with the State. The parties disagree on the significance of the decisions for purposes of the instant dispute. The Respondent alleges that the decisions support the right of a private party to renounce its rights under a treaty, while the Claimant maintains that their significance is limited to the waiver of contractual rights. Both are correct according to whether the present dispute is a contractual dispute or a dispute between a State and an investor under a BIT. The Commissions that decided these cases recognized that an individual could commit himself to submit his contractual claims to the local courts, but at the same time they differentiated these claims from the claims of their States under international law which they, as individuals, could not have waived. An early commentator on the \"Calvo clause\" and *North American Dredging* said: \"in so far as the Calvo clause demands resort to local remedies for breach of contract, it is legitimate, but superfluous; for that rule is clearly stated and thoroughly established in international law. In so far as the clause attempts to forbid interposition under any circumstances, whether by a promise to that effect, or by regarding the alien as a citizen for the purposes of the contract, or by a unilateral definition of denial of justice, or otherwise, it is illegal and futile; for international law clearly states the right to interpose in case of denial of justice.\"88\n\n*Woodruff v. Venezuela, R1AA,* volume IX, Hague ICJ Registry, p. 213.\n\n*North American Dredging Company of Texas v. United Mexican States, R1AA,* volume IV, Hague ICJ Registry, p. 26.\n\nC. Eagleton, *The Responsibility of States in International Law,* New York University Press, 1928, p. 175.\n\n85.\n\nThe significance of the cases for this Tribunal is that the private parties could waive access to the Commissions to settle contractual disputes with a State with which they had contracted. In the dispute before the present Tribunal, as has been affirmed by the Respondent, the State is not a party to any of the Contract Documents, and there was no waiver commitment made by the Claimant in favor of Argentina. Since the Tribunal has found that the waiver does not cover the claim of Azurix in the dispute before it, the Tribunal does not need to comment further on the issue of renunciation by individuals of rights conferred upon them by treaty.\n\n**4. Second objection to jurisdiction - the dispute has already been submitted to the courts of Argentina under Article VII of the BIT (\"fork-in-the-road\" argument)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nArgentina bases this objection on the administrative appeals filed by ABA, and on the fact that \"all the issues relative to the dispute between the Province and ABA have been submitted to the Court of Justice of the Province in the framework of the discussions around the validity of Decree No. 2598/01, by which it rescinded the Concession Agreement.\"89 The Respondent argues that the action before the Supreme Court and the claim before the Tribunal have an identical basis and that ABA and Azurix have recognized this by requesting that the submitted claim be \"filed\" due to this arbitration.90 The administrative appeals filed fall within the scope of what the BIT defines as administrative courts. In support of its argument the Respondent refers to the decisions on jurisdiction in *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States* (hereinafter *Waste Management)91* and *Vivendi I.* These decisions, in the Respondent\u2019s opinion, \"consider that what matters from the viewpoint of the choice of jurisdiction established by the bilateral investment treaties is that there should be coincidence between the basis of the arbitration case presented under such international instruments and the claim brought before the local alternative forum.\"92\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 80.\n\nIbid., paras. 82 and 85.\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States,* 2 June 2000, 5 *ICSID Rep.* 443.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 92.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant considers the objection to lack merit because there is no identity of parties between this arbitration and the cases brought by ABA before the local courts: the latter are actions directed to protect ABA\u2019s rights without compromising Azurix\u2019s access to ICSID arbitration, there is no identity of claims, and the arbitration was initiated before the first court action was filed by ABA.93 The Claimant denies that ORAB is an administrative tribunal for purposes of the BIT and that proceedings carried out before this entity could have marked the commencement of the proceedings now before local courts.94 The Claimant also considers as misplaced the reliance on *Waste Management* by the Respondent to assert that identity of facts is sufficient to trigger the fork-in-the-road provision of the BIT. It notes that this is specific to NAFTA and that \"the majority of the first tribunal in *Waste Management* held that Article 1121, in order to bar access to international arbitration, required merely an identity of facts without taking into consideration whether the proceedings were based on claims arising from domestic law or NAFTA.\"95 On the other hand, the fork-in-the-road provision of the BIT \"requires identity of facts and causes of action in the local and international proceedings for the provisions to be triggered.\"96\n\nAzurix\u2019s Rejoinder, paras. 103 and ff.\n\nIb\u00edd., para. 119.\n\nIbid., para. 132.\n\nIbid.\n\n88.\n\nIn one of the first cases that an ICSID tribunal had to decide on the existence of a pending suit and its relevance to the ICSID proceedings, the tribunal \"declared that there could only be a case of *lis pendens* where there was identity of the parties, object and cause of action in the proceedings pending before both tribunals\"97.\n\n*Benvenuti and Bonfant SRL v. the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of the Congo,* 1 *ICSID Rep.* 340 at para. 1.14.\n\n89.\n\nThis line of reasoning has been consistently followed by arbitral tribunals in cases involving claims under BITs, unless, as noted above, the controlling agreement provided otherwise, as in the case of NAFTA. The most recent instance involves the same BIT and Respondent as in the present case. In *CMS,* the tribunal referred to decisions of several ICSID tribunals that have held that \"as contractual claims are different from treaty claims, even if there had been or there currently was a recourse to the local courts for breach of contract, this would not have prevented submission of the treaty claims to arbitration. This Tribunal is persuaded that with even more reason this view applies to the instant dispute, since no submission has been made by CMS to local courts and since, even if TGN had done so -which is not the case-, this would not result in triggering the \"fork-in-the-road\" provision against CMS. Both the parties and the causes of action under separate instruments are different \"98\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. the Republic of Argentina* (Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction of July 17, 2003, 42 *ILM* 800. para. 80.\n\n90.\n\nNeither of the parties is a party to the proceedings before the local courts. Even if Azurix had joined ABA as a plaintiff in those courts, there would not be party identity since Argentina is not party to any of those proceedings.\n\n91.\n\nThe parties have discussed extensively the jurisdictional nature of ORAB in relation to the date when the administrative proceedings started. The significance of this date being that, if the filings before ORAB are considered to be claims before a court for purposes of Article VII of the BIT, then all 12 cases were filed with the administrative courts after the request for arbitration in the instant case was submitted to ICSID.\n\n92.\n\nGiven the conclusion reached above on the differentiation of the claims and the parties, the Tribunal does not need to consider this matter extensively; it simply records that it is not persuaded that ORAB is equivalent to an administrative tribunal for purposes of the BIT. It does not have the independence required of a tribunal and does not have a judicial function to settle conflicts with the concessionaire. The law under which ORAB was established characterizes the decisions of ORAB, taken within the limits of its competence, as administrative acts that bind the concessionaire and against which the latter may interpose administrative remedies as permitted by the provincial law and without prejudice to its right to file a claim before courts.99 To maintain otherwise is to admit that ORAB as a judicial organ may be party and judge in the same dispute.\n\nLaw 11,820, Annex II, Chapter XII, Article 51.\n\n**5. Alleged additional consequences**\n--------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Respondent has presented arguments based on the consequences that would follow from an affirmation of jurisdiction by the Tribunal. They concern claims that (a) the Tribunal is *forum non conveniens,* (b) it is impossible for the Tribunal to decide on the claims made by Azurix without interpreting the Concession Agreement or performing regulatory functions, (c) the Claimant has indulged in abuse of process, (d) certain adverse economic impacts will result from the Tribunal\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction, (e) the subsidiaries of Azurix are its *alter ego,* and (f) double recovery. The Tribunal will now consider each of these alleged consequences.\n\n**a)** ***Forum non conveniens***\n---------------------------------\n\n94.\n\nArgentina claims that the Tribunal is *forum non conveniens* for the Province, saying that a finding that it has jurisdiction could entail a denial of justice to the Province because it is not a party to the proceeding and it is also a creditor of ABA. In the same vein the Respondent has argued that ABA\u2019s other shareholders are not going to have the opportunity of being granted a remedy because of the submission of the dispute to arbitration by Azurix. The Tribunal finds that these are not relevant factors for determining its jurisdiction. Other creditors, including the Province, or other shareholders are not precluded from bringing claims provided they meet the jurisdictional requirements of the forum to which they apply.\n\n**b) Determination of the scope of rights under the Concession Agreement and performance of regulatory functions**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nAs to Argentina\u2019s claim that it is impossible for this Tribunal to resolve the dispute without deciding the scope of ABA\u2019s and the Province\u2019s rights under the Concession Agreement or performing regulatory functions by undertaking the task of judicial review of the decisions of the regulatory agencies of the Province and Argentina, the Tribunal notes that its role is limited to deciding whether Argentina has breached its obligations to Azurix under the BIT. The extent to which this requires an analysis of facts which may have been put before an Argentine court or administrative tribunal, and the extent to which those facts are relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s determination of merits is not for the Tribunal to judge at this stage but they are not relevant considerations for the Tribunal to take into account in determining the jurisdiction of the Centre and its on competence on the basis of Article 25 of the Convention and Article VII of the BIT.\n\n**c) Abuse of process**\n-----------------------\n\n96.\n\nBased on the reasons given in the consideration of the second objection to jurisdiction, the Tribunal finds that there is no abuse of process by Azurix by the submission of its claim to this forum.\n\n**d) Economic impact**\n----------------------\n\n97.\n\nThe Respondent has requested that the Tribunal bear in mind certain \"economic variables\" in determining its jurisdiction and assessing ABA\u2019s and Azurix\u2019s strategy.100 The Respondent has listed possible adverse economic impacts of Azurix\u2019s overall strategy, *inter alia.* ABA is making itself insolvent to the detriment of its creditors such as the Province, and ABA\u2019s receivables in respect of its debtors and creditors, including the Province, have been pesified, yet Azurix formulates its claims in US dollars. On the basis of the provisions that frame its competence, the Tribunal finds that it has no grounds to include such variables in a determination of its competence.\n\nArgentina\u2019s Reply on Jurisdiction, para. 23 and ff.\n\n98.\n\nWhether these variables should be considered in the merits phase as the Respondent has requested should the Tribunal dismiss its jurisdictional objection, is a matter, if raised again, for decision at that time.\n\n**e)** ***Alter ego*** **issue**\n--------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nArgentina claims that \"AZURIX participated in the Bidding procedure through companies whose capital belonged one hundred per cent to AZURIX, they were mere instruments and a simple *alter ego* of AZURIX. ABA was also a simple vehicle to express AZURIX\u2019s interests and will.\"101 This structure is then used by Azurix to exercise contractual rights or rights under the BIT according to its convenience.102\n\nIb\u00edd., para. 16.\n\nIbid., Heading, para. 19 and ff.\n\n100.\n\nThe Tribunal has already discussed the issues related to the multiple fora and the rights that Azurix may have under the BIT as an investor through the companies that participated in the bidding and ABA. The Tribunal needs only to note here for purposes of the *alter ego* argument that the Province awarded the Concession to said subsidiaries and the Province required that they formed a local company with whom it signed the Concession Agreement. These undisputed facts are sufficient ground for the Tribunal to dismiss the *alter ego* argument.\n\n**f) Double recovery**\n----------------------\n\n101.\n\nIn the course of its submissions Argentina has indicated its concern that Azurix should not be able to recover twice, through proceedings before this Tribunal and via ABA through proceedings before the local courts. The Tribunal appreciates Argentina\u2019s concern, and notes that any compensation awarded must be based on the actual loss a claimant is able to show. However, the question before the Tribunal at this stage is whether it has jurisdiction; whether the Claimant can prove loss is a matter to be considered as part of the merits.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n102.\n\nHaving carefully considered the parties\u2019 arguments in their written pleadings and oral submissions, and for the reasons stated above, the Tribunal:\n\n1. Finds that:\n\n(a) Azurix has shown that, *prima facie,* it has a claim against Argentina for breach of obligations owed by Argentina to Azurix under the BIT.\n\n(b) Azurix has *ius standi* to bring this claim, and\n\n(c) the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n2. Rejects the request of the Respondent to suspend the proceeding.\n\n103.\n\nThe Tribunal has, accordingly, made the necessary Order under Arbitration Rule 41(4) for the continuation of the procedure.\n\n104.\n\nEach party has requested that the costs of the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings, including its own costs, be borne by the other. The Tribunal further decides to consider this matter as part of the merits."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2006-07-14T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**I.

Procedural background**\n-----------------------------\n\n3.\n\nOn September 19, 2001, Azurix filed a request for arbitration against the Argentina Republic, with the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (hereinafter the \"Centre\"). Azurix claims that Argentina has violated obligations owed to Azurix under the 1991 Treaty Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment between the Argentine Republic and the United States of America (hereinafter \"the BIT\"), international law and Argentine law in respect of Azurix's investment in a utility which distributes drinking water and treats and disposes of sewerage water in the Argentine Province of Buenos Aires. Azurix alleges such breaches were made by Argentina both directly through its own omissions and through the actions and omissions of its political subdivisions and instrumentalities.\n\n4.\n\nOn October 23, 2001, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Azurix's request for arbitration, pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and National of other States (hereinafter \"the Convention\").\n\n5.\n\nOn November 12, 2001, the parties agreed that the Arbitral Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each party and the third presiding arbitrator to be appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council of the Centre. Accordingly, the Claimant appointed Professor Elihu Lauterpacht, C.B.E. Q.C., a British national, and the Respondent appointed Dr. Daniel H. Martins, an Uruguayan national. Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, a Spanish national, was appointed President after consultation with the parties.\n\n6.\n\nThe Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted on April 8, 2002 and the proceeding to have commenced. On the same date, the parties were notified that Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nIn accordance with Arbitration Rule 13, the Tribunal held its first session with the parties in Washington D.C. on May 16, 2002. Mr. R. Doak Bishop of King & Spalding represented the Claimant at the first session, and Mr. Hern\u00e1n Cruchaga and Ms. Andrea G. Gualde of the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires, acting on instruction from the then Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Dr. Rub\u00e9n Miguel Citara, represented the Respondent at the first session.\n\n8.\n\nAt the first session, the parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted and that they had no objection to any of the members of the Tribunal, and it was noted that the proceedings would be conducted under the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force since September 26, 1984 (hereinafter \"the Arbitration Rules\"). In respect of the pleadings to be filed by the parties, their number, sequence and timing, it was announced after consultation with the parties that the Claimant would file its Memorial within 150 days of the date of the first session, the Respondent would file its CounterMemorial within 150 days of the date of receipt of the Memorial, the Claimant's Reply would be filed within 60 days of the date of receipt of the Counter-Memorial, and the Respondent's Rejoinder would be filed within a further 60 days of its receipt of the Reply. It was further noted by the Tribunal that, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules, the Respondent had the right to raise any objections it might have to jurisdiction no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for filing its Counter-Memorial. If such objections to jurisdiction were made by the Respondent and rejected by the Tribunal, it was agreed that the above timetable would be resumed following the resumption of proceedings on the merits.\n\n9.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable decided during the first session, Azurix filed its Memorial on the merits on October 15, 2002, claiming that Argentina had breached the BIT by expropriating its investment by measures tantamount to expropriation without prompt, adequate and effective compensation (Article IV(1)), by failing to accord to it fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, and treatment required by international law (Article II(2)(a)), by taking arbitrary measures that impaired Azurix's use and enjoyment of its investment (Article II(2)(b)), by failing to observe obligations Argentina entered into with regard to Azurix's investment (Article II(2(c)), and by failing to provide transparency concerning the regulations, administrative practices and procedures and adjudicatory decisions that affect Azurix's investment (Article II(7)). In addition, Azurix requested orders for the payment of compensation for all damages suffered and the adoption by Argentina of all necessary measures to avoid further damages to Azurix's investment. Azurix expressly reserved its right to request a decision on provisional measures under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 39.\n\n10.\n\nOn March 7, 2003, Argentina filed a Memorial on jurisdiction raising two objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The first was that Azurix agreed to submit this dispute to the courts of the city of La Plata and waived any other jurisdiction and forum; the second was that Azurix had already made a forum selection under Article VII of the BIT by submitting the dispute to Argentine courts. On March 12, 2002 the Tribunal suspended the proceeding on the merits pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(3), and set dates for filing pleadings on jurisdiction. Accordingly, Azurix filed its Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction on May 13, 2003.\n\n11.\n\nAzurix filed a request for provisional measures on July 15, 2003 (dated July 14, 2003), subsequently supplemented by two letters dated July 21 and 28, 2003. The request sought a provisional measure recommending that Argentina refrain from incurring by itself or through any of its political subdivisions in any action or omission capable of aggravating or extending the dispute, taking into account especially the reorganization of Azurix's Argentine subsidiary, Azurix Buenos Aires S.A. (hereinafter \"ABA\"), or any other measure having the same effect.\n\n12.\n\nAt the request of the Tribunal, Argentina filed observations on Azurix's request for provisional measures on July 24, 2003, seeking dismissal of the request for provisional measures together with costs and requesting that the Tribunal request the Claimant to produce an original copy of the Decision of the Appeals Chamber of the Province of Buenos Aires.\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal, in a decision of August 6, 2003, rejected Azurix's request for provisional measures, considering that, in the circumstances of the case and at that stage of proceedings, it was not in a position to recommend the specific measure requested or to propose others with the same objective. The Tribunal did, however, invite the parties to abstain from adopting measures of any character which could aggravate or extend the controversy submitted to arbitration, and took note of statements made by Argentina affirming that the Province of Buenos Aires (hereinafter \"the Province\") recognizes that the receivables for services rendered by ABA before March 7, 2002 belong to ABA, and that those collected or to be collected in the future have been or will be deposited in a special banking account, and that the situation described in Azurix's request would not affect the enforceability or execution of any award rendered on the merits. The Tribunal postponed its decision on costs in respect of the provisional measures request to a later stage of the proceedings and considered it unnecessary to request the Claimant to furnish the Tribunal with the Decision of the Appeals Chamber.\n\n14.\n\nArgentina filed its Reply on jurisdiction on August 4, 2003\n\n15.\n\nAzurix filed a Rejoinder on jurisdiction on August 29, 2003.\n\n16.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction took place in London on September 9 and 10, 2003. The parties were represented by Messrs. R. Doak Bishop, Guido Santiago Tawil, Ignacio Minorini Lima and Craig S. Miles, on behalf of the Claimant. Messrs. Carlos Ignacio Su\u00e1rez Anzorena, and Jorge Barraguirre, and Ms. Beatriz Pallar\u00e9s, from the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, and Mr. Osvaldo Siseles, from the Secretar\u00eda Legal y Administrativa del Ministerio de Econom\u00eda y Producci\u00f3n, represented the Respondent. On December 8, 2003 the Tribunal issued its Decision on Jurisdiction, which is part of this Award, declaring that the dispute was within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.\n\n17.\n\nDuring the hearing on jurisdiction, the Respondent had requested an extension of 90 days to file its Counter-Memorial on the merits should the Tribunal find that it had jurisdiction. On December 8, 2003, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 establishing the schedule for the further procedures on the merits. According to that schedule, the Respondent was granted an extension of 50 days and its CounterMemorial on the merits was due within 60 days from the date of that Procedural Order; the Claimant was to file its Reply within 60 days from its receipt of the Respondent's Counter-Memorial, and the Respondent was to file its Rejoinder within 60 days from its receipt of the Claimant's Reply.\n\n18.\n\nOn February 9, 2004, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the merits. In the Counter-Memorial, Argentina requested the Tribunal to order the Claimant to produce all reports, analysis and other documentation related to the Claimant's participation in the privatization of the water supply and sewerage services of the Province and the Claimant's IPO. The Respondent also requested, if considered appropriate by the Tribunal, that the Tribunal ask the United States Congress to furnish the reports related to ENRON's scandal and its relationship to Azurix.\n\n19.\n\nOn February 20, 2004, it was agreed that the hearing on the merits would take place in Paris from October 4 to 8, 2004 and, if necessary, extend it to October 1112.\n\n20.\n\nOn March 8, 2004, the Tribunal invited Azurix to comment on Argentina's evidence request in the Counter-Memorial. Azurix objected to the request on March 15, 2004 and requested the Tribunal that, in case it would agree to Argentina's request, Argentina be invited in turn to produce all documentation related to AGOSBA's services, their privatization, the original setting of the tariffs, all documents of the Privatization Commission, the ORAB, and the files related to ABA, AGOSBA and ABSA. The Respondent commented on Azurix's objection on March 29, 2004 and manifested its willingness to request the Province to produce evidence that the Tribunal considered relevant under Arbitration Rule 34.\n\n21.\n\nOn March 29, 2004, the parties agreed to extend by three weeks the schedule for the presentation of the Reply and the Rejoinder.\n\n22.\n\nOn April 19, 2004, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 inviting the Respondent to request the Province to furnish the documentation filed with the Province for participating in the bidding process (Envelop No. 1 \u2013the technical offer- and Envelop No. 2 \u2013the economic offer) (\"Envelops No. 1 and No. 2\"), and postponed consideration of the production of the remainder of the evidence requested until the Tribunal had an opportunity to review the Reply, which was due by May 7, 2004.\n\n23.\n\nThe Respondent furnished the documentation requested under Procedural Order No. 2 on May 17, 2004. At the same time, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal do not distribute such documentation until Azurix had furnished its own copies of Envelops No. 1 and No. 2. At this point, the Respondent alleged certain irregularities in Circulars 51(b) and 52(a) and pointed out changes in the Concession Agreement which were not part of the draft agreement included in the bidding documents.\n\n24.\n\nOn May 24, 2004, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 requesting Azurix to furnish the Tribunal its own copies of Envelops No. 1 and No. 2 and withheld the documentation received from the Respondent.\n\n25.\n\nAzurix, instead of presenting its own copies of Envelops No. 1 and No. 2, sought copies directly from the Province allegedly for convenience's sake. On May 31, 2004, the Respondent objected that, by seeking the documents from the Province, Azurix had not complied with Procedural Order No. 3, withdrew its request related to the production of Envelops No. 1 and No. 2, informed the Tribunal on irregularities it had detected in Envelop No. 2 and requested that the Tribunal charge to the Claimant the costs related to this procedural incident.\n\n26.\n\nOn July 24, 2004, the Respondent requested an extension of 10 days to file its Rejoinder. The extension was granted on August 10, 2004.\n\n27.\n\nOn July 29, 2004, the Tribunal issued procedural Order No. 4 rejecting the request for production of evidence formulated in the communication of the Respondent of July 22, 2004 because of its general nature and failure to justify it.\n\n28.\n\nOn August 3, 2004, the Secretariat notified the parties that Professor Lauterpacht had resigned as an arbitrator for health reasons, and suspended the proceedings in accordance with Arbitration Rule 10(2). On the same date, the Secretariat notified the parties that the Tribunal had consented to Professor Lauterpacht's resignation in accordance with Arbitration Rule 8(2). On August 4, 2004, Mr. Marc Lalonde, a Canadian national, was appointed as an arbitrator by the Claimant in replacement of Professor Lauterpacht. On August 10, 2004, the Tribunal was reconstituted and the proceedings were resumed.\n\n29.\n\nOn August 16, 2004, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 rejecting a further Respondent's request, dated August 2, 2004, for production of evidence because it considered that it was not adequately justified even if more precise than the request of July 22, 2004. On the same date, Argentina notified the appointment of Mr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino as the Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina.\n\n30.\n\nOn August 17, 2004, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits.\n\n31.\n\nOn August 23, 2004, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to reconsider Procedural Order No. 5. The Claimant reiterated its objections to the Respondent's request on August 26, 2004. The Tribunal, after considering anew the Respondent's request and having then had the opportunity to review the Rejoinder, issued Procedural Order No. 6, requesting the Claimant to submit, not later than September 17, 2004, the study prepared by Hytsa Estudios y Proyectos, S.A. (\"Hytsa\") referred to in paragraph 35 of the Rejoinder, and the Respondent to submit by the same date the bid evaluation reports related to each stage of the bidding for the Concession.\n\n32.\n\nAs previously decided, the hearing on the merits was held, from October 4-13, 2004, at the World Bank's office in Paris, France. Present at the hearing were:\n\n*Members of the Tribunal*\n\nDr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, President  \nThe Hon. Marc Lalonde, P.C, O.C., Q.C., Arbitrator  \nDr. Daniel H. Martins, Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat*\n\nMs. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*On behalf of the Claimant*\n\nMr. R. Doak Bishop (King & Spalding, Houston, Texas)  \nMr. John P. Crespo (King & Spalding, Houston, Texas)  \nMr. Craig S. Miles (King & Spalding, Houston, Texas)  \nMs. Zhennia Silverman (King & Spalding, Houston, Texas)  \nMs. Carol Tamez (King & Spalding, Houston, Texas)  \nMr. Guido Santiago Tawil (M & M Bomchil, Buenos Aires, Argentina)  \nMr. Francisco Guti\u00e9rrez (M & M Bomchil, Buenos Aires, Argentina)  \nMr. Federico Campolieti (M & M Bomchil, Buenos Aires, Argentina)\n\n*Also attending on behalf of the Claimant*\n\nMr. Steve Dowd (Azurix Corp.)  \nMr. Lou Stoler (Azurix Corp.)\n\n*On behalf of the Respondent*\n\nMr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino (Procurador, Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires, Argentina)  \nMr. Ra\u00fal Vinuesa (Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires, Argentina)  \nMr. Gabriel Bottini (Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires, Argentina)  \nMr. Juan Jos\u00e9 Galeano (Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires, Argentina)  \nMr. Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9s (Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires, Argentina)  \nMs. Mar\u00eda Soledad Vallejos Meana (Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n, Buenos Aires, Argentina)\n\n*Also attending on behalf of the Respondent*\n\nMs. Guillermina Cinti (Provincia de Buenos Aires)  \nMr. Roberto Salaberren (Provincia de Buenos Aires)  \nMr. Juan Carlos Schefer (Provincia de Buenos Aires)\n\n33.\n\nOn November 29, 2004, the Respondent filed an application to disqualify the President of the Tribunal under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention. In accordance with Arbitration Rule 9(6), the proceedings were suspended. Pursuant to Article 58 of the Convention, the co-arbitrators issued a Decision dated February 25, 2005 on the Challenge to the President of the Tribunal declining the Respondent's disqualification proposal, which was notified to the parties on March 11, 2005.\n\n34.\n\nOn March 14, 2005, the proceedings were resumed in accordance with Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n35.\n\nOn March 15, 2005, the Centre transmitted to the Tribunal the parties' Post- Hearing Briefs of November 29, 2004.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal met in Washington, DC from September 7 to 9, 2005 to discuss a draft of this award, and decided to request Azurix to explain, not later than September 28, 2005, certain discrepancies in the amounts in the financial statements of ABA for fiscal years 2000 and 2001. Azurix furnished its explanation on September 27, 2005 and the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on it by October 17, 2005. The Respondent sent comments on October 14, 2005.\n\n37.\n\nOn April 17, 2006, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38. By letter of June 13, 2006 the Tribunal extended by a further 30 days the period by which the award would be drawn up, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 46.\n\n**III. Background to the Dispute**\n----------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nIn 1996 the Province started the privatization of the services of Administraci\u00f3n General de Obras Sanitarias de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (\"AGOSBA\"), the Province owned and operated company which provided potable water and sewerage services in the Province. The Province passed Law 11,820 (\"the Law\") to create the regulatory framework for privatization of AGOSBA's services. The future operator of the water services would be granted a concession which would be overseen and regulated by a new regulatory authority established for the purpose - Organismo Regulador de Aguas Bonaerense (\"ORAB\"). The concessionaire was required to be a company incorporated in Argentina. The Province engaged Schroeders Argentina S.A. (\"Schroeders\") as adviser for the privatization of AGOSBA and requested Schroeders to distribute an information statement to potential investors. Schroeders sent the information statement to ENRON Corporation (\"ENRON\") inviting this company to participate in the bidding. ENRON requested from a consulting company, Hytsa Estudios y Proyectos S.A. (\"Hytsa\") a preliminary report on the information furnished by the Province in the Data Room on AGOSBA and its operations.\n\n39.\n\nThe privatization process was conducted by the Privatization Commission, which tendered the concession on the international market on the basis of the Law and of a set of contract documents prepared in accordance with the Law by ORAB, including the Bidding Terms and Conditions and a draft Concession Agreement.\n\n40.\n\nA bid offer was made by two companies of the Azurix group of companies established for this specific purpose: Azurix AGOSBA S.R.L. (\"AAS\") and Operadora de Buenos Aires S.R.L. (\"OBA\"). AAS and OBA are indirect subsidiary companies of Azurix. AAS is registered in Argentina and is 0.1% owned by Azurix and 99.9% owned by Azurix Argentina Holdings Inc. (a company incorporated in Delaware), which in turn is 100% owned by Azurix. OBA, also registered in Argentina, is 100% owned by Azurix Agosba Holdings Limited which is registered in the Cayman Islands. Azurix owns 100% of the shares in Azurix Agosba Holdings Limited.\n\n41.\n\nHaving successfully won their bid, AAS and OBA incorporated Azurix Buenos Aires S.A. (\"ABA\") in Argentina to act as concessionaire. On June 30, 1999, ABA (also referred to as \"the Concessionaire\") made a \"canon payment\" of 438,555,554 Argentine pesos (\"the Canon\") to the Province. On payment of the canon, ABA, AGOSBA and the Province executed a concession agreement (\"the Concession Agreement\") which granted ABA a 30-year concession for the distribution of potable water, and the treatment and disposal of sewerage in the Province (\"the Concession\"). Handover of the service took place on July 1, 1999.\n\n42.\n\nAzurix declared to know and accepted the bidding conditions and committed itself to undertake all measures necessary to ensure that OBA would fulfill the obligations set forth in the bidding conditions and the Concession Agreement as operator of the Concession during the first 12 years of operation. Similarly, Azurix accepted to be jointly responsible for the obligations of AAS and that during the first six years of the Concession there would be no change in the control of AAS.\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimant contends that its investment in Argentina has been expropriated by measures of the Respondent tantamount to expropriation and that the Respondent has, in addition, violated its obligations, under the BIT, of fair and equitable treatment, non-discrimination and full protection and security; that such measures are actions or omissions of the Province or its instrumentalities that resulted in the non application of the tariff regime of the Concession for political reasons; that the Province did not complete certain works that were to remedy historical problems and were to be transferred to the Concessionaire upon completion; that the lack of support for the concession regime prevented ABA from obtaining financing for its Five Year Plan; that in 2001, the Province denied that the canon was recoverable through tariffs; and that \"political concerns were always privileged over the financial integrity of the Concession\",1 and \"[w]ith no hope of recovering its investments in the politicized regulatory scheme, ABA gave notice of termination of the Concession and was forced to file for bankruptcy\".2\n\nMemorial, p.7.\n\nIbid.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent has disputed the allegations of the Claimant. For the Respondent, the dispute is a contractual dispute and the difficulties encountered by the Concessionaire in the Province were of its own making. In particular, the Respondent has argued that the case presented by the Claimant is intimately linked to Enron's business practices and its bankruptcy; that the price paid for the Concession was excessive and opportunistic and related to the forthcoming IPO of Azurix at the time Azurix bid for the Concession through AAS and OBA and that the Concessionaire did not comply with the Concession Agreement, in particular its investment obligations, and the actions of the Province, including the termination of the Concession Agreement by the Province, were justified.\n\n45.\n\nBefore proceeding to examine the facts and the parties' allegations, the Tribunal will make the following preliminary observations concerning the responsibility of the Respondent for actions or omissions of the Province, the scope of the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the Claimant's ENRON relationship, allegations of corruption, Argentina's economic crisis and the law applicable to the merits of the dispute.\n\n**IV. Preliminary Observations**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. Responsibility of the Respondent for Actions and Omissions of the Province**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Argentina is responsible for the actions of the Province under the BIT and customary international law. Indeed, the definition of investment covers investments made in the territories of the parties to the BIT, and the BIT in its preamble refers to the territory of each of the parties in reference to its reach. Furthermore, Article XIII makes the BIT explicitly applicable to the political subdivisions of the parties. The Claimant also refers to the responsibility of the State for acts of its organs under customary international law and cites, as best evidence, Articles 4 and 7 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts of the International Law Commission (\"ILC\") (\"Draft Articles\").\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimant also notes the decision on the merits in *Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic* (*\"Vivendi* \") where the tribunal stated that: \"It is well established that actions of a political subdivision of [a] federal state, such as the Province of Tucum\u00e1n in the federal state of the Argentine Republic, are attributable to the central government.\"3 The Annulment Committee confirmed that statement: \"in the case of a claim based on a treaty, international rules of attribution apply, with the result that the state of Argentina is internationally responsible for the acts of its provincial authorities.\"4\n\n*Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. & Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Award of Tribunal of November 21, 2000. para. 49.\n\n*Compa\u00f1ia de Aguas del Aconquija, S.A. & Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decisi\u00f3n on Annulment, July 3, 2002. para. 96\n\n48.\n\nThe Respondent has not disputed that the BIT applies to the Province or the responsibility of the central State for acts of provincial authorities under customary international law. The Respondent has based its counter-argument on the fact that the Claimant's allegations are in all instances based on breaches of obligations contractually assumed by the Province. Hence, according to the Respondent, the Tribunal does not need to reach the stage of whether the BIT imposes absolute responsibility on the central government for actions of a political subdivision because the Claimant has failed to allege facts that are attributable to the Argentine Republic under the BIT.\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the Claimant takes for granted the highly debatable proposition that contractual breaches result in a violation of the BIT. The Respondent then refers, among others, to statements in the Annulment Decision in *Vivendi II* to the effect that: \"As to the relation between breach of contract and breach of treaty in the present case, it must be stressed that Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not relate directly to breach of a municipal contract. Rather they set an independent standard\", and \"A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and *vice versa*, and this is certainly true of these provisions of the BIT\u2026 It may be that \"mere\" breaches of contract, unaccompanied by bad faith or other aggravating circumstances, will rarely amount to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard \u2026\" From these statements, the Respondent concludes that \"a claimant in similar cases may not invoke as events or facts giving rise to international responsibility the same facts that constitute a breach of contract \u2026 international rules are 'independent rules'. Therefore, a State's international responsibility may not be asserted by disguising mere contractual breaches.\" The Respondent concludes by recalling that to address the conflicts of a contractual nature raised by the Claimant, both ABA and Azurix have waived their right to submit them to any other jurisdiction other than the administrative courts of the city of La Plata.5\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 932-937.\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nThe responsibility of States for acts of its organs and political subdivisions is well accepted under international law. The Draft Articles, as pointed out by the Claimant, are the best evidence of such acceptance and as such have been often referred to by international arbitral tribunals in investor-State arbitration. Moreover, Article XIII of the BIT states clearly: \"This Treaty shall apply to the political subdivisions of the Parties.\" This is not in dispute between the parties. The issue is whether the acts upon which Azurix has based its claim can be attributed to the Respondent. The Respondent contends that such attribution is not feasible because all the acts are contractual breaches by the Province. This is a different matter to which the Tribunal will now turn.\n\n**2. Scope of the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that its decision on jurisdiction is based on the finding that the Claimant had shown a *prima facie* claim against the Respondent for breach of obligations owed by Argentina to the Claimant under the BIT. In that decision, the Tribunal noted that:\n\n\"The investment dispute which the Claimant has put before this Tribunal invokes obligations owed by the Respondent to Claimant under the BIT and it is based on a different cause of action from a claim under the Contract Documents. Even if the dispute as presented by the Claimant may involve the interpretation or analysis of facts related to performance under the Concession Agreement, the Tribunal considers that, to the extent that such issues are relevant to a breach of the obligations of the Respondent under the BIT, they cannot *per se* transform the dispute under the BIT into a contractual dispute\".6\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, para. 76.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal also recalls that Azurix and the Respondent have no contractual relationship. The Concession Agreement is a contract between the Province and ABA, and Azurix made certain commitments and undertook certain guarantees to the Province at the time of the bidding for and signature of the Concession Agreement. None of the allegations made by the Claimant refer to breaches of the Province in relation to Azurix itself. The obligations undertaken by the Province in the Concession Agreement were undertaken in favor of ABA not Azurix. As the Respondent itself has asserted, Argentina is not party to the Concession Agreement, and ABA is not party to these proceedings. Therefore, the underlying premise of Article II(2c) of the BIT \u2013 that a party to the BIT has entered into an obligation with regard to an investment \u2013 is inexistent. Neither the Respondent nor the Province, as a political subdivision of the Respondent, has entered into a contractual relationship with Azurix itself.\n\n53.\n\nThe Tribunal, in evaluating the facts and the allegations of the parties, is mindful that its task is to determine whether the alleged actions or omissions of the Respondent and the Province, as its political subdivision, amount to a breach of the BIT itself. For this purpose, and since the allegations of the Claimant are based on disputes related to the Concession Agreement, the Tribunal will need to determine the extent to which the Province was acting in the exercise of its sovereign authority, as a political subdivision of the Respondent, or as a party to a contract. As stated by the tribunal in the case of *Consortium FRCC c. Royaume du Maroc*, a State may perform a contract badly, but this will not result in a breach of treaty provisions, \"unless it be proved that the state or its emanation has gone beyond its role as a mere party to the contract, and has exercised the specific functions of a sovereign.\"7 It should be noted, however, that this was not just any contract as between two private parties. It was a Concession Agreement embodying the tariff regime of the Concession and the actions taken by the Province were taken in its capacity as a public authority and by issuing resolutions through its regulator and decrees, actions which can hardly be treated as those of \"a mere party to the contract.\"\n\n*Consortium FRCC v. Royaume du Maroc* (ICSID Case. No. ARB/00/6), Sentence arbitrale, para. 65. See also *Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/3), Decision on jurisdiction (*Impregilo*), para. 260.\n\n54.\n\nAs noted earlier, Argentina has questioned the ability of a claimant to invoke as events or facts giving rise to international responsibility the same facts that constitute a breach of contract. The Tribunal has no doubt that the same events may give rise to claims under a contract or a treaty, \"even if these two claims would coincide they would remain analytically distinct, and necessarily require different enquiries.\"8 To evoke the language of the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi II*, the Tribunal is faced with a claim that it is not \"simply reducible to so many civil or administrative law claims concerning so many individual acts alleged to violate the Concession Contract or the administrative law of Argentina\", but with a claim that \"these acts taken together, or some of them, amounted to a breach\" of the BIT.9 This is the nature of the claim in respect of which the Tribunal held that it had jurisdiction and which the Tribunal is obliged to consider and decide.\n\nIbid., para. 258.\n\nDecision of Annulment Committee, para. 112.\n\n**3. The ENRON relationship**\n-----------------------------\n\n55.\n\nArgentina has placed substantial emphasis on the fact that Azurix was a subsidiary of ENRON and has alleged that Azurix followed the aggressive and dubious practices of ENRON in its bidding for and subsequent operation of the Concession. For purposes of the dispute before this Tribunal and based on the documentation submitted by the parties, the Tribunal considers that nothing has been proven that relates the case before this Tribunal to ENRON's case. The proven facts are that ENRON was invited by the Province to bid for the Concession and ENRON declined in 2001 to guarantee a loan of Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina to ABA under the program of the National Sanitation Works Agency (\"ENOHSA\") financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (\"IDB\").\n\n**4. Corruption**\n-----------------\n\n56.\n\nIn 2002, at the time Argentina was preparing the Rejoinder on jurisdiction, it realized that Section 12.1.1 of the Concession Agreement was added after the award of the Concession. ABA's exemption of fines during the first six months of the Concession for failure to meet the Concession's performance standards was also added after the award of the Concession. The Tribunal was informed by Argentina that an investigation of this matter had been initiated by the office of the Procurador del Tesoro. During the hearing on the merits, and as a reaction to insinuations of corruption during the examination by Argentina of a witness presented by Argentina, counsel for the Claimant asked the witness whether to his knowledge there had been any corruption in connection with the award of the Concession. The witness replied that he was not aware of any improper conduct, and the Procurador General present at the hearing confirmed that the investigation was continuing but that no evidence of improper conduct had surfaced. No further information has been transmitted to the Tribunal.\n\n**5. Argentina's Economic Crisis**\n----------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nArgentina has pleaded that the institutional, social and economic crisis that it endured in the period 1998-2002 was the worst in its history.10 On the other hand, the Claimant has alleged that the Respondent deliberately confuses the economic recession starting in 1998 with the economic and political crisis that began in 2001. According to the Claimant, the recession and economic crisis took place after termination of the Concession Agreement, are irrelevant for the purposes of this arbitration and cannot justify the Province's breaches of the Concession Agreement. The Claimant further observes that Argentina does not claim any justification based on the recession and only notes it as a background fact.11 The Tribunal notes that the parties have not argued that the actions of the Province, ABA or Azurix had been influenced by the economic crisis. The crisis may provide context to the dispute, but none of the parties has pleaded that the economic crisis was the cause of the actions taken by the Province, ABA or Azurix.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 851, pp.243-245.\n\nReply, pp. 193-194.\n\n**V. Applicable law**\n---------------------\n\n**1. Positions of the parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nThe Claimant has argued that Article 42 of the Convention, in its first sentence, directs the Tribunal to look first to the rules of law agreed by the parties. Since the parties have not agreed to the governing law, the Tribunal should apply the BIT as *lex specialis* between the parties, and international law. The BIT expressly requires Argentina to comply with international law, and the BIT and international law have been incorporated by Argentina in its domestic law.12\n\nMemorial, p. 149.\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant refers, among others, to Professor Weil's opinion that: \"the existence of a Bilateral Investment Treaty raises the question of compliance with the rights and obligations contained therein to the level of a matter under international law, with respect not only to relations between the States party to the treaty *but also to relations between the host State and the investor*.\" According to the Claimant, the BIT requires \"the Argentine Republic to afford U.S. investors like Azurix treatment no less favorable than that required by international law, both with respect to investment generally, and in particular with respect to expropriations or measures tantamount to expropriation of an investment.\"\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimant also relies on the statement of the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi II* on the law applicable to the determination of whether a breach of the BIT has occurred, \"In such a case, the inquiry which the ICSID tribunal is required to undertake is one governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law. Such an inquiry is neither in principle determined, nor precluded, by any issue of municipal law, including any municipal law agreement of the parties.\"13\n\nIbid., p. 151.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant adds that international law also applies under the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the Convention. The Claimant relies here again on the authority of Professor Weil,\n\n\"no matter how domestic and international law are combined, under the second sentence of Article 42(1), international law always gains the upper hand and ultimately prevails. It prevails indirectly through the application of domestic law where the latter is deemed consistent with international law or incorporates it. It prevails directly where domestic law is deemed deficient or contrary to international law. Thus, under the second sentence of Article 42(1), international law has the last word in all circumstances: international law is fully applicable and to classify its role as 'only' 'supplemental and corrective' seems a distinction without a difference.\"14\n\nIbid., 155-156.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent draws a different conclusion from the fact that the parties have not agreed on the applicable law. In such a case, the Tribunal shall apply \"the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute, including its rules on the conflicts of laws, and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\" (Article 42(1) of the Convention). In accordance with this article, the dispute is basically governed by Argentine law, which is also applicable to contractual matters and provincial administrative law underlying the claim. However, the Respondent admits that the BIT is \"the point of reference for establishing the merits of the Argentine Republic's obligations in connection with Azurix's investment. Non-contractual international law is relevant to the extent that the Treaty refers to it, or to the extent relevant to interpretation of the contract, or to the extent included in Argentine law.\"15\n\nCounter-Memorial, p. 47.\n\n63.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant concurs in that the BIT is the point of reference to judge the merits and reaffirms that the BIT is the *lex specialis* between the parties. The Claimant is unsure about the meaning of \"non-contractual international law\" and affirms that all relevant international law may be applicable. The Claimant adds that customary international law provides a floor or minimum standard of treatment for foreign investment while the terms of the BIT may provide a higher standard.16\n\nReply, paras. 18-20.\n\n64.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent reaffirms its considerations in the Counter-Memorial whereby, pursuant to Article 42 of the Convention, \"the dispute is basically governed by Argentine law which is also applicable to contractual matters and by the provincial administrative law underlying Azurix's claim.\"17\n\nRejoinder, para. 21.\n\n**2. Considerations of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal notes first the agreement of the parties with the statement that the BIT is the point of reference for judging the merits of Azurix's claim. The Tribunal further notes that, according to the Argentine Constitution, the Constitution and treaties entered into with other States are the supreme law of the nation, and treaties have primacy over domestic laws.18\n\nSection 31 and Section 75(22).\n\n66.\n\nArticle 42(1) has been the subject of controversy on the respective roles of municipal law and international law. It is clear from the second sentence of Article 42(1) that both legal orders have a role to play, which role will depend on the nature of the dispute and may vary depending on which element of the dispute is considered. The Annulment Committee in *Wena v. Egypt* considered that \"The law of the host State can indeed be applied in conjunction with international law if this is justified. So too international law can be applied by itself if the appropriate rule is found in this other ambit.\"19\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4). *Ad hoc* Committee Decision on Application for Annulment, dated February 5, 2002, 41 ILM (2002) p. 941.\n\n67.\n\nAzurix's claim has been advanced under the BIT and, as stated by the Annulment Committee in *Vivendi II*, the Tribunal's inquiry is governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law. While the Tribunal's inquiry will be guided by this statement, this does not mean that the law of Argentina should be disregarded. On the contrary, the law of Argentina should be helpful in the carrying out of the Tribunal's inquiry into the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement to which Argentina's law applies, but it is only an element of the inquiry because of the treaty nature of the claims under consideration.\n\n68.\n\nBefore the Tribunal considers the meaning of each of the standards allegedly breached by the Respondent, and because this discussion is closely related to the conflicting views of the parties on the facts of the dispute and their implications, the Tribunal will now consider at length the facts and then each of the standards of treatment of the BIT supposedly breached by the Respondent. In considering the allegations of the parties under each of the factual situations, the Tribunal will assess to which extent the established facts evidence actions on the part of the Province in the exercise of its public authority or as a party to a contract. The Tribunal will follow the order in which the facts have been presented in the memorials taking into account the witness statements, the documentation submitted, expert opinions and the written and oral arguments made by the parties.\n\n**VI. The Facts**\n-----------------\n\n**1. The Takeover of the Concession**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimant has alleged that on the day of the transfer of the Concession, July 1, 1999, no representatives of the Province or AGOSBA were present to ensure an orderly and safe transfer. According to the Claimant, critical documents were burnt in the facility located at the Plaza San Mart\u00edn, and in nearly all branches tools and equipment to operate the Concession were missing. The Claimant alleges also to have found certain anomalies in the customer database, \u2013 i.e. the archives of large account customers were missing and so were the methodology for calculating VAT amounts, interest calculation, whether or not a property was a vacant lot, the due date of installments, etc. According to the Claimant, ABA communicated the specific deficiencies of the database to the MOSP and ORAB in October 1999 after it received an inadequate response from AGOSBA, and did not receive an \"effective response\" from either.20\n\nMemorial, pp. 25-29.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent has pointed out that Claimant alleged no difficulties at the takeover of the Concession in the request for arbitration, in the grounds for the termination of the Concession Agreement adduced by the Claimant or in the discussions on the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). According to the Respondent, the execution of the Concession Agreement took place in the presence of all the relevant provincial authorities, the Concession area is very large and it was not possible for officials to be present physically at all locations, and the Bidding Conditions provided a remedy in Article15.1.3 for such a situation. ABA never notified the Province of any conflict or negligence by the Province in connection with the takeover.\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that all necessary information was made available to the bidders as part of the privatization related documentation and drawings and maps were made available to ABA on July 2, 1999 and that, in accordance with Section 2.4 of the Terms of Reference, Azurix acknowledged full access to all information and waived any claim to insufficient or non-delivery of information. The Respondent also points out that no claim was ever made in connection with defective equipment or tools and considers that the allegations of the Claimant in respect of the database are inadmissible. The Respondent refers in this respect to a communication of ABA to AGOSBA in terms that show deference and gratitude rather than offense for lack of cooperation. According to the Respondent, the database may have contained errors and defects but they were known to all bidders. The Respondent concludes by affirming that the takeover took place in a \"context of mutual cooperation.\"21\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 167-194.\n\n72.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant alleges that the Respondent relies on formalisms. It disputes the meaning given by the Respondent to Article 15.1.1, since this section could only be invoked if the 'legal' transfer was not made. Equally, the Claimant considers misplaced the reference to Section 2.4, since this Section presumes good faith in the Province's discharge of its duties and cannot be invoked when insufficient information was not received because of obstruction and sabotage by provincial employees.22 The Claimant contests the affirmation that no complaints were ever made. In fact, numerous complaints were filed with the Privatization Commission, the ORAB, the Provincial Governor and Argentine federal officials.23\n\nReply, paras. 76-77.\n\nIbid., para. 68.\n\n73.\n\nThe Claimant admits in its Reply that 12,700 maps were received on July 2, 1999, but that they were in total disarray and ABA had to engage the services of Halcrow to digitalize and organize the documentation. The maps were old, outdated and failed to describe the current state of the Concession. In contrast, ABA's employees were approached by former AGOSBA staff to offer them digitalized updated maps of the Concession, that, according to them, could substantially reduce the number of network expansions required under the Concession Agreement.24\n\nIbid., paras. 70-72.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent in the Rejoinder reaffirms its understanding of Article 15.1.3 of the Bidding Conditions and disputes that it only applies to the \"legal\" transfer. The takeover was a defined term in the Concession Agreement: \"The act whereby the Concessionaire assumes the provision of service according to Chapter 15.\"25 The Respondent confirms that all documentation, including blueprints, maps and the users' database, was provided to the Concessionaire. ABA had the obligation under the Concession Agreement to digitalize the maps, and, if the Concessionaire employed Halcrow for this purpose, it was to fulfill an obligation not because the Province did not comply with providing the pertinent information.26 The Respondent finds that none of the evidence provided by the Claimant shows that ABA voiced any complaints during the six-month period following the takeover. ABA did not even mention it at the time of submitting its First Five-Year Plan proposal.27\n\nRejoinder, paras. 148-152.\n\nIbid., para. 170.\n\nIbid., para. 185.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent concludes by alleging that the evidence shows that the conflict identified as \"takeover\" was created by Azurix for these proceedings and that ABA and Azurix raised concerns about facts related to the takeover before provincial and federal authorities when their officers were warned about possible international arbitration proceedings.28\n\nIbid., para. 186.\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the Claimant has failed to prove that the irregularities that may have occurred had the serious consequences that the Claimant has alleged and that can be attributable to the Province. The item with most serious implications would seem to be the destruction and removal of documentation, in particular of Concession's maps. As admitted in the Reply, these maps were supplied by AGOSBA to ABA and ABA had the obligation to digitalize them. It would appear that the maps that the former employees had digitalized were more current than those furnished to ABA by the Province but no evidence has been furnished to the Tribunal showing that the alleged up to date maps offered by former employees of AGOSBA had been updated while in the service of AGOSBA and removed before the handover of the Concession, or that they were ever in the possession or control of the Province.\n\n**2. Measures related to the tariff regime**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nThe measures under this heading include the elimination of zoning coefficients, the valuation applicable to non-metered customers whose property had undergone construction changes, the so-called Valuations 2000, and the RPI. The Tribunal will consider them in that order.\n\n***(a) Zoning Coefficients***\n-----------------------------\n\n***(i) Positions of the parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n78.\n\nOn April 9, 1999, the Privatization Commission issued Information Communiqu\u00e9 No.12 on zoning coefficients. This communiqu\u00e9 attached a list of coefficients that \"will apply for the correction of fiscal valuation of property and allow for determining the billing ranges as per Sanitary Rates in each district to which AGOSBA provides services according to provisions of Act 10,474 Section 7\". The communiqu\u00e9 added: \"Please note that the tariff scheme that shall apply to the Concession shall be the one contained in Annex \u00d1, which does not contemplate any zoning coefficients.\"\n\n79.\n\nThe Privatization Commission was asked the following question on Communiqu\u00e9 No. 12:\n\n\"Question No. 160: Annex \u00d1 Concession Contract. The information communiqu\u00e9 No. 12 leaves evidence that the tariff system, which will rule the concession, will be the one included in Annex \u00d1, which does not contemplate zoning coefficients. Is it correct to assume that the new billing could surpass the one determined in the last billing previous to the taking over due to the fact that it was affected by such adjustment?\"\n\n80.\n\nOn April 23, 1999, the Privatization Commission replied:\n\n\"It is clarified that as regards the tariff system, it is governed by what is established in Annex \u00d1 of the Concession Agreement and the tariffs set not only for metered system but also for the non-metered system in Section 4 of the aforesaid Annex should be especially taken into account.\"\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimant concludes from this exchange that it was reaffirmed that Annex \u00d1 would govern the application of the non-metered tariff regime and that water bills would be increased for those persons who previously benefited from zoning coefficients.29\n\nMemorial, p. 33.\n\n82.\n\nAccording to Circular 59(A) of June 25, 1999, AGOSBA issued the first billing cycle after the transfer of the Concession so that the new Concessionaire would have sufficient time to prepare. When ABA sent the bills for its first billing cycle (the second billing cycle after the transfer) without applying the zoning coefficients, consumers reacted badly to the resulting price increase. This event happened during the presidential campaign in which the governor of the Province, Mr. Duhalde, was running for president of the country.\n\n83.\n\nOn August 4, 1999, the ORAB issued Resolution 1/99. According to this resolution, ABA was precluded from billing amounts in excess of those amounts billed by AGOSBA for non-metered service prior to the granting of the Concession, and it ordered ABA to credit those amounts that exceeded AGOSBA's final billing for non-metered service during the month of August. ORAB based Resolution 1/99 on Article 4a-1 of Title II of Annex \u00d1 which states: \"The tariff that results due to the application of the scale shall not exceed the one determined by the final billing prior to the Taking of Possession, for the same real estate, i.e., provided no building developments have been recorded.\"\n\n84.\n\nABA appealed administratively Resolution 1/99. ABA argued that Resolution 1/99 equated the terms tariff and bill, that a bill increase is not necessarily a tariff increase, that it did not change the tariff; and that it had simply eliminated the zone coefficient and, while the bills were higher, the tariff remain unchanged. The ORAB rejected the appeal by Resolution 2/00 of January 19/00 and dismissed ABA's interpretation of Annex \u00d1 as inconsistent with the regulatory framework promulgated by the Law.\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the action taken by the ORAB was politically motivated under pressure of the Government of the Province which was concerned that higher water bills would damage the chances of Mr. Duhalde in the presidential race. According to the Claimant, the press reported statements by the Minister of Public Works (MOSP) to the effect that the bills issued by ABA were incorrect and that consumers should not pay them until the issue was clarified (testimony of Mr. Castillo quoted in the Memorial p. 33). The Claimant further alleges that the Minister of MOSP \"wanted to ease and postpone the solution in any way\" till after the presidential election.30\n\nTestimony of Mr. Guaragna quoted in the Memorial, p. 34.\n\n86.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the action taken by ABA was correct and permitted under the Concession Agreement. The Claimant bases its position on the interpretation provided by Circular 27(A) and on the different meanings of the terms bill and tariff. Tariff is \"a public document that includes a description of the company services, rates and charges, as well as the governing rules, regulation and practice in relation to those services\".31 It is inappropriate to use tariff as a synonym of rates or prices, \"the tariff is nothing else that a list of prices or rates\".32 According to the Claimant, the ORAB contravened the Law by not providing a well-founded decision in dismissing the appeal of ABA as required by Chapter III, article 13-II of the Law.\n\nL. Goodman, The Process of Ratemaking, Virginia: Public Utilities Reports, Inc. (1999) p. 45 quoted in the Memorial, p. 37.\n\nVillegas Basavilbaso, Derecho Administrativo, vol. 3, p. 178, quoted by M. Marienhoff in Tratado de Derecho Administrativo, 1981, vol. II p. 133 (Exhibit 33 to the Memorial).\n\n87.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the position of the Claimant has no basis on the Contract or on the Communiqu\u00e9 or the Circular. The Respondent first recalls that the non-metered system was a temporary system that should have been replaced 100% by a metered system by year five of the Concession, and that the Communiqu\u00e9 is not part of the contractual documentation of the Concession. In rejecting the understanding by the Claimant of the Communiqu\u00e9 and the Circular, the Respondent explains that, according to article 4 of Annex \u00d1, the Concessionaire needed to follow two criteria for billing purposes: first, the bill should be the result of multiplying the presumed consumption by the price per cubic meter established on the basis of the valuation of the building concerned, and second, the resulting bill should not exceed that of the last bill prior to the takeover of the Concession. Thus, if the bill resulting from applying the values in the table included in article 4 exceeded the bill before the takeover, then the consumer should be charged only what had been charged then. The exceptions were only for new customers that, by definition, would not have received a bill prior to the Concession takeover, and in the case of construction variations which would affect the fiscal valuation of the building.\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent expresses its inability to understand how the Claimant can rely on the distinction between tariffs and rates to justify its position. The Respondent agrees with the definition of tariffs and rates provided by the Claimant and affirms that the Province never maintained that these concepts were the same or were used indistinctly.33 The Respondent cannot follow how a bill for a building for a non-metered service may be increased without at the same time increasing the tariffs.34\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 277.\n\nIbid., para. 280.\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent considers that it was always clear that Annex \u00d1 did not contemplate zoning coefficients and the clarification in Communiqu\u00e9 No.12 would have been unnecessary. This does not mean that bills for the first month of the Concession could be increased; the function of article 4 (a-1) was to avoid this effect.35 Equally irrelevant, for purposes of the Claimant's interpretation, is Circular 27(A). This circular replied to the question by simply referring to the provisions of Annex \u00d1, in particular what is provided in article 4.36 According to the Respondent, once the appeal of Resolution 1/99 was rejected, the decision of the ORAB became administratively firm and unassailable under the administrative law of the Province.37\n\nIbid., para. 293.\n\nIbid., para 297-298.\n\nIbid., paras. 301-303.\n\n***(ii) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nBoth parties agree that zoning coefficients are not included in Annex \u00d1. They also agree on the meaning of the terms tariff, bills and rates. Communiqu\u00e9 No.12 was issued by the Privatization Commission at its own initiative, so it may have considered it necessary to point out that Annex \u00d1 did not include zoning coefficients. When applied to a bill, coefficients had the effect of reducing it. Hence the follow up question to the Privatization Commission - question No. 160 - specifically asking whether \"Is it correct to assume that the new billing could surpass the one determined in the last billing previous to the taking over due to the fact that it was affected by such adjustment?\" The Commission replied \u2013 item No. 20 of Circular 27(A) - by referring generally to the tariff regime in Annex \u00d1 and stating that \"the tariffs set not only for the metered system but also for the non-metered system in Section 4 of the aforesaid Annex should be especially taken into account\".\n\n91.\n\nThis statement evaded the answer to the question asked and left ample room for misunderstanding. The interpretation of paragraph 4(a) by the Claimant is based on the difference between tariffs and bills which is reflected in the terminology of the Concession Agreement. In the key subparagraph of article 4, we read: \"the resulting tariff from the application of said scale shall not exceed that determined in the last billing\u2026\" The paragraph clearly refers to tariffs and billing as two different matters, what should not be exceeded is the tariff applied in the last billing, not the billing itself. This being the case, the reading by the Claimant of the Concession Agreement and of the information provided by the Privatization Commission would seem reasonable. Indeed, if there is a subsidy resulting from the application of a zoning coefficient and such subsidy ceases to be applicable, the bill will necessarily be higher without any increase in the underlying tariff. To interpret the Contract otherwise, it is to admit that the Information Communiqu\u00e9 No. 12 was openly misleading and Circular 27(a), at best, evasive.\n\n92.\n\nTo conclude, the ORAB provided an interpretation of the Concession Agreement not in accordance with the concepts of tariff, rates and bills underlying it and with the information provided the bidders at the time they prepared the tenders. The decision of ORAB seems to reflect a concern with the political consequences of the elimination of the coefficients rather than with keeping to the terms of the Concession Agreement.\n\n***(b) Construction Variations: Resolution 7/00***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n***(i) Factual background***\n----------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Concession Agreement permitted the Concessionaire to re-categorize non-metered customers whose fiscal valuation had changed because of construction improvements. On February 17, 1999, March 8, 1999 and March 24, 1999, the Claimant requested the Privatization Commission for the updated records of property valuations of the *Direcci\u00f3n Provincial de Catastro Territorial* (DPCT). On May 5, 1999, the Commission issued Circular 44(A) stating that the records had not been updated since 1994 except for individual updates \"which occurred on a daily basis by customers visiting local branch offices.\"38 Allegedly the Claimant continued to press for the records39 and on June 23, 1999, the Commission issued Circular 58(A) with a CD containing the valuations of the DPCT.\n\nMemorial, p. 42.\n\nIdem\n\n94.\n\nBased on this information, ABA identified about 60,000 non-metered customers whose properties reflected a valuation increase. In January 2000, ABA informed the ORAB that it would re-categorize these customers into a higher tariff scale. On February 8, 2000, the ORAB issued Resolution 7/00 ordering ABA to abstain from re-categorizing these customers until the ORAB would have verified the valuation changes with DPTC. After three weeks, ABA appealed Resolution 7/00.\n\n95.\n\nOn March 17, 2000, the ORAB, by Resolution 15/00, authorized retroactive increases for construction variations of lands that were paying for the water service as uncultivated land and appeared as built lots in the CD attached to Circular 58(A). In these cases, it was evident that the different valuation was due to construction.\n\n96.\n\nOn June 26, 2000, the ORAB issued Resolution 54/00 rejecting the appeal of ABA. Resolution 54/00 recalled that, in the presentation made by ABA, it was not evident that the changes in fiscal valuation were due to construction variations and, therefore, the ORAB considered it necessary to conduct a study to determine the rationale of the variations. Resolution 54/00 affirmed that Resolution 7/00 only requested the Concessionaire to abstain from re-categorizing the properties and did not alter the procedure established in the Concession Agreement for the application of the valuations furnished by the Cadastre.40\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 321-325.\n\n97.\n\nThe study conducted by the ORAB revealed that 76% of the variations presented by the Concessionaire were due to construction on the properties concerned.41 On November 22, 2001, after ABA had terminated the Concession, the ORAB issued Resolution 62/01 authorizing the re-categorization of those properties subject to the approval of a business plan to mitigate the impact on users. ABA presented the business plan on December 11, 2001. The ORAB requested further information on the plan on December 28, 2001. ABA responded on January 29, 2002. According to the Respondent, the relationship of ABA with the Province and the ORAB and the delivery of the service had deteriorated to such an extent that the ORAB requested the MOSP Undersecretary to include this matter among those to discuss between the Province and ABA.42 Thereafter, the MOSP Undersecretary advised ABA by letter not to proceed with the re-categorization. According to Azurix and based on press reports, the re-categorization took place once the Concession was transferred to Aguas Bonaerenses.\n\nIbid., para. 328.\n\nIbid., para. 332.\n\n98.\n\nThe facts as described have not been contested by the parties.\n\n***(ii) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nResolution 7/00 did not refer to the reasons why the ORAB considered it necessary to verify the variations with DPCT. The Resolution ordered ABA to refrain from re-categorization until the ORAB had determined whether the variations were actually construction variations. The ORAB acted on the basis of an internal report of February 8, 2003 that alerted it to the fact that the CD attached to Circular 58(A) did not distinguish between variations in fiscal valuations for construction or other reasons. This simple factual information was not referred to in Resolution 7/00.\n\n100.\n\nConstruction variations had been the subject of several questions during the bidding process so a clear understanding of what the term meant seems to have been important from the bidders' point of view. According to Annex \u00d1, the real estate fiscal valuations to be applied were those furnished by the DPTC. When the information was furnished to the bidders with Circular 58(A), this Circular did not refer to variations in fiscal value. When ABA identified the variations, it had no way to know whether they were caused by construction activity or other reasons. When the ORAB became aware of the issue, it would have seemed appropriate to base its reasoning on this fact, rather than to simply refer to the need to verify the valuation changes, which was understood as a delay tactic by the Concessionaire. The reason for the verification became only apparent when Resolution 15/00 was issued and the appeal was rejected.\n\n101.\n\nThe ORAB proceeded to identify the previously uncultivated lots with relative speed as compared with the time that it took to verify the other valuation changes. Resolution 15/00 was issued within 5 weeks of Resolution 7/00. On the other hand, Resolution 62/01 was issued more than 21 months after Resolution 7/00. Even if the tariff increases could be applied retroactively and the number of variations to be verified was large, this seems to have been an unduly protracted process. The delay also meant that the application of the new level of tariff would result in larger amounts to be paid retroactively with the consequent negative perception from the consumers' point of view. When the ORAB authorized the re-categorization, a plan to mitigate the impact was required from ABA and, even when such plan had been approved by the provincial authorities, the re-categorization by ABA was not authorized by MOSP.\n\n102.\n\nTo conclude, the bidders were not provided with accurate information on the variations, and the Province seems to have engaged in a protracted dilatory process; first in identifying the construction variations and then in delaying the recategorization. As in the case of the zone coefficients, the concern was on the political effect rather than with applying the terms of the Concession Agreement.\n\n***(c) Valuations 2000***\n-------------------------\n\n103.\n\nThe Concession Agreement specified that the 1958 valuations methodology or its equivalent be used to determine the appropriate tariff schedules for non-metered customers. The 1958 valuation was discontinued by the DPCT in early 2000 by law 12,397 of the Province.\n\n***(i) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the change in property valuation methodology caused a fundamental problem for ABA as it became impossible to apply accurately Valuations 2000 to the existing non-metered tariff scale.43 The new methodology prevented the application of the tariff regime to new real estate created and to updated valuations for existing real estate that had experienced construction variances.44 Since the Province did not provide an equivalent methodology, as required by the Concession Agreement, ABA proceeded to prepare an equivalent methodology and presented it to the ORAB on November 22, 2000. According to the Claimant, the ORAB avoided responding on the equivalent methodology proposal notwithstanding persistent communications of ABA, and no determination was ever made by the ORAB.45\n\nMemorial, p. 50.\n\nIbid. p. 51.\n\nReply, paras. 173-190.\n\n105.\n\nThe Respondent argues that it was not the role of ABA to prepare equivalent valuations and that the Concession Agreement was clear that the equivalent valuations had to be determined by the DPCT. Furthermore, the change to Valuations 2000 would have a minimum impact on the Concessionaire since it would only affect construction variations in existing properties and new properties in the Concession area. In any case, the Concession Agreement provided the way to calculate the applicable tariffs when there was inadequate real estate valuation. According to the Respondent, the methodology proposed by ABA was a disguised effort to increase tariffs, a fact that is denied by the Claimant.\n\n106.\n\nThe Respondent points out that ABA in fact made a proposal to valuate *ex officio* properties which had no valuation on February 29, 2000. The DPCT informed ABA that it could not decide on this matter because the system in effect did not permit the establishment of a valuation mechanism such as proposed by ABA. However, the ORAB, by Resolution 45/00 of June 13, 2000, permitted ABA and AGBA to carry out *ex officio* valuations as proposed by ABA.46\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 345-371.\n\n***(ii) Considerations by the Tribunal***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Province proceeded to change the valuation system in the first quarter of 2000, shortly after the Concession was awarded. The bidders were not informed of the upcoming change. When the change occurred no alternative methodology was provided. The complaint of Azurix seems to be more on the lack of a meaningful response by the Province than anything else. Even the arrangement proposed by ABA in February 2000 was put forward at its own initiative, although it was the Province's responsibility to provide alternative methodologies as explained by the Respondent. Irrespective of the merits of ABA's proposal and whether it meant a raise on applicable tariffs to the properties affected by the valuations, this tariff conflict could have been avoided by simply instructing the Concessionaire on what to do at the time the new law was issued and as part of its implementation. It seems that the administration of the Province was not very pro-active in search of solutions to a problem that the Province itself had created.\n\n***(d) Retail Price Index (RPI) issue***\n----------------------------------------\n\n***(i) Background***\n--------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Concession Agreement provides for extraordinary revisions of the tariffs on account of, *inter alia*, variations in cost indices. According to Article 12.3.5.1, the concept of such revisions is as follows: \"These revisions shall be carried out where the Concessionaire or the Regulatory Entity alleges an increment or fall in the Concession cost indexes when its absolute value exceeds three per cent (3%), in accordance with the provisions set out in clause 12.3.5.2.\" Article 12.3.5.2 sets forth the formula for the calculation of the percentage cost index variation. For this purpose, the formula uses as a basis 50% of the change in the Consumer Price Index of the United States and 50% of the change in the Producer Price Index, Industrial Commodities, also of the United States.\n\n109.\n\nABA requested the commencement of the procedures for the tariff review foreseen in Article 12.3.5.3 of the Concession Agreement on December 20, 2000 based on a 6,659% increase in the RPI. On January 3, 2001, the ORAB regulatory department noted in a letter to the Board of the ORAB that ABA had met the formal regulatory requirements of said article and was authorized to seek an RPI review.47 On January 30, 2001, Mr. Pievani, the head of the economic regulation area of the ORAB, sent a further report to the ORAB president confirming the 6,659% RPI increase but considering the request inadmissible based on consequences related to the provision of the service and to the users, in particular, he referred to the Bah\u00eda Blanca incident, which is considered later in this award. On February 8, 2001, the President of the ORAB notified the MOSP Undersecretary of ABA's request and recommended the denial of the tariff review. On February 27, 2001, the MOSP instructed the ORAB to solicit from ABA a detailed cost study justifying the impact of the variance of prices on ABA's cost structure, to conduct its own cost study and to condition the review and ultimate submission of the request to the Executive Branch on ABA's presentation of the cost study. On March 9, 2001, the ORAB notified ABA of the need to present a cost study.\n\nExhibit 70 to the Memorial.\n\n110.\n\nABA responded to the cost study request in a note to the ORAB, dated March 18, 2001, requesting ORAB to clarify the procedural or contractual framework on which ORAB based its request.48 The ORAB reiterated the request for a cost study within five days on April 5, 2001. On April 16, 2001, ABA responded by explaining \"the economic and financial principles behind the RPI adjustment as an integral element of price cap regulation and price controls, and the importance of the regulator's objectivity to insure the transparency of the regulatory process\".49 On May 14, 2001, ABA sent the ORAB a more comprehensive analysis of the economic and financial principles underlying inflationary adjustments and a discussion of the automatic and objective nature of the inflationary review process.50\n\nMemorial, p. 61.\n\nIbid., p. 62.\n\nIbid., p. 63.\n\n111.\n\nOn May 30, 2001, the ORAB sent a letter to the MOSP Undersecretary informing him of ABA's concerns with the handling of the RPI request by the Province and requesting the advice of the provincial Organismos de Asesoramiento y Control (Asesor\u00eda General de Gobierno, Contadur\u00eda General and Fiscal\u00eda de Estado). After these organs had expressed their opinion, the ORAB issued, on October 24, 2001(after ABA had terminated the Concession Agreement) Resolution 53/01 whereby it summoned ABA \"to furnish the ORAB with a study on costs that warrant the incidence of such indexes on tariffs in order to verify the admissibility of an extraordinary tariff revision\" within ten days under the penalty of the tariff revision request be disallowed. Since ABA did not provide the cost study requested, the ORAB issued Resolution 23/02 on March 26, 2002 (after the Province had taken over the Concession) dismissing the request.\n\n***(ii) Positions of the Parties***\n-----------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe controversy on the RPI is related to the extent that the review had an automatic character under the Concession Agreement. The Claimant argues that such review was automatic once the correctness of the elements underlying the percentage calculation had been verified, that this was an essential element of price-cap regulation and that there was no need to present a cost study. Such study was required only for the extraordinary tariff review foreseen elsewhere in the Concession Agreement. The Claimant notes that it was notified of the need of a cost study nearly three months after it filed its RPI request when in accordance to the contract the review of ORAB was to be completed within 30 days, and that the cost study was mandated by the MOSP Undersecretary but it did not figure in the ORAB's early evaluation of the review, nor in the separate report of Mr. Pievani. The Claimant alleges that the protracted process outlined by the Regulatory Group in the ORAB and the addition of a cost study were politically motivated and that there is no basis for them in the Concession Agreement. Furthermore, the public hearings do not have the role in the case of the RPI review attributed to them by the Respondent. Their objective is to provide transparency in the process of tariff reviews. According to the Claimant, the last paragraph of Article 12.3.5.3 proves that, once the revision is considered pertinent, the percentage of variation in the RPI had to be applied to the tariffs established in US dollars.\n\n113.\n\nThe Respondent has alleged that the procedure for the extraordinary tariffs reviews was common to all such reviews, and that there was no automatic raise of tariffs simply by the fact that a review had been triggered by a certain level of inflation. The steps required to be undertaken for such review were followed by the ORAB without the cooperation due by ABA to the regulatory organ of the Province and without any political motivation on the part of the Province which at all times followed the provisions of the Law and the Concession Agreement. The function of the public hearing goes beyond that attributed to it by the Claimant and it is the same for all tariff reviews. The ultimate decision to approve a tariff review request was the function of the provincial Governor.\n\n***(iii) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n------------------------------------------\n\n114.\n\nAs in the other controversies under the generic heading of tariff conflicts, the issues are based to a large extent on the interpretation of the Concession Agreement, in particular, Article 12. This Article has the following structure: General Principles (12.3.1), Procedure (12.3.2), Automatically Unacceptable Assumptions for Increases in the Tariffs and Prices (12.3.3), Ordinary Five-Year Reviews (12.3.4), Extraordinary Reviews based on Variations in the Indices of Costs (12.3.5), and General Extraordinary Reviews (12.3.6).\n\n115.\n\nOne of the general principles applicable to all revisions (\"modificaciones\") is that revisions of the tariffs and prices can compensate only the costs arising from the delivery of the Service provided that there is compliance with the terms of the Agreement. The procedure to be followed is common for all revisions and includes, *inter alia*, the requirements that the revisions be based \"on prior analyses and technical, economic, financial and legal reports, and on proof of the facts and actions that justify the revision\", and that there be an evaluation of the consequences that may result from the revision in respect of the delivery of the service and of the users. In addition, the proposed revisions shall be debated in a public hearing before the executive approves or rejects proposed revisions.\n\n116.\n\nIn the specific context of the revisions for reason of variations in the cost indices, Article 12.3.5.3 entitled \"Verification of Revision Admissibility\" provides that, once it is established that a variation is above the percentage set forth in Article 12.3.5.1, the procedure moves on to \"the verification stage\" where the ORAB is required to verify the existence of the elements that justify the revision in accordance with the general principles of Article 12.3.1 and the provisions of Article 12.3.5. Once the verification is completed, the ORAB shall determine whether the revision is justified and the modification to be introduced to the existing tariffs and prices. If the ORAB finds the revision justified, then a public hearing on the proposed revision should take place. The conclusions of the ORAB and the minutes of the hearing are sent to the executive which decides whether to agree to the revision or reject it.\n\n117.\n\nIt is evident from a reading of the contractual provisions that the Concession Agreement applies the same procedure to all reviews, therefore, a review for variations in cost indices is not more or less automatic than an ordinary five-year review. The elements that trigger the review are objective and whether a review should or should not take place could be seen as automatic once the correctness of the calculations have been verified, but this is the first step in the process. The ORAB then had to decide on the appropriateness of any revisions taking into account the general principles in Article 12.3.1, one of which is that modifications may only compensate for actual costs in the delivery of the service, and the consequences that the modification may have for service delivery and the users. The fact that the revision would be the subject of a public hearing and that the executive may or may not approve it show that a cost indices variation revision was not assured, under the terms of the Concession Agreement, to produce the result of simply transferring the variation in the costs indices to the tariffs and prices.\n\n118.\n\nThe parties have also argued whether the cost study requested from ABA by the ORAB was appropriate. The Claimant has placed special emphasis on the political motivation of the request since it was not in the original assessment of the ORAB. Given that under the terms of the Concession Agreement the ORAB was obliged to evaluate whether the modification based on variation in the cost indices was justified in terms of the general principle that modifications should reflect the costs of the service, the request would seem to be legitimate.\n\n119.\n\nIn interpreting the Concession Agreement and as affirmed by the parties and required by the Agreement itself, it is necessary to proceed with a harmonious reading of all the relevant provisions. While the last paragraph of Article 12 would seem to indicate that once the review is considered justified then the price index increase shall be applied to the tariffs retroactively as calculated, this provision cannot be read in such a manner as to contradict the general principle established in Article 12.3.1. The Tribunal is not convinced that the position taken by the Province would have changed the economic equilibrium of the Concession, as Azurix has claimed, as long as the principle to reflect actual cost variations due to inflation had been respected. In any case, this point is speculative since the review was never completed.\n\n**3. The Works in Circular 31(A)**\n----------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Privatization Commission issued Circular 31(A) on April 23, 1999 on the subject of works under execution. This circular lists works in progress for purposes of Article 15.3.1 of the Concession Agreement and explains that, once the works would have been completed, they would be transferred without charge to the Concessionaire. Each work is listed with the location, a brief description, the amount budgeted and the percentage of completion. It is disputed whether the works were ever completed. ABA either refused to accept them because it considered them defective, or accepted them provisionally, according to ABA, in order to prevent a collapse of the water supply system. We will consider each of these works in the sequence presented by the Claimant in its Memorial and the allegations made by the parties in their respect.\n\n***(a) Bah\u00eda Blanca: Algae Removal Works***\n-------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nThe so-called \"Algae removal works at the Paso de las Piedras Dam\" in Circular 31(A) consisted of the construction of a micro-filtering plant, refurbishment of certain key aspects of the Patagonia WTP filters, the repair of the system that evenly distributes the incoming water between the two filtration modules at the Patagonia WTP (\"the Equipartition system\"), the modification of certain elements of the direct filtration system at the Patagonia WTP (\"Direct Filtration\"), and the construction of a chlorine dioxide dosing facility (\"Chlorine Dioxide Dosing System\"). The Province retained the responsibility for the operation of the Reservoir and supplying raw water to the Patagonia WTP.\n\n***(i) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nIn the Memorial, the Claimant alleges that the Algae Removal Works had serious defects in their design and construction. The Claimant gives as examples that the Micro-Filtration Plant as designed permitted raw untreated water to by-pass microfiltration, the Direct Filtration system was only partially completed and the items installed were never connected, the Equipartition System was only partially completed and did not allow even distribution of water to the filter modules, the Patagonia Filters were not completed, and the Chlorine Dioxide Dosing system was defective in its design and construction and posed operational safety hazards.\n\n123.\n\nOn August 24, 1999, explains the Claimant, ABA provided the ORAB with a list of necessary short-term corrective measures to be completed prior to ABA taking possession of the Algae Removal Works, including that the water level at the Reservoir was unusually low, the new Micro-Filtering Plant was overloaded, the sand filters at the Patagonia WTP were old and overloaded, and the repairs to the Equipartition system failed to evenly distribute water. ABA also proposed the creation of a technical committee for the operation of the dam and reservoir to define contingency plans for drought periods and determine minimum quality standards to be met by the raw water supplied by the Province.51\n\nMemorial, pp. 71-73.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the failure to complete the Algae Removal Works caused an extraordinary algae bloom in the reservoir on April 10-11, 2000 resulting in the water appearing cloudy and hazy and with earth-musty taste and odor. According to the Claimant, the complaints of the consumers were picked up by the press and politicians and it became a major media and political event. The Claimant contends that none of the factors that caused the algae bloom were subject to ABA's control nor could the algae bloom have been foreseen based on the information supplied by the Province. This notwithstanding, observes the Claimant, provincial officials issued statements that caused panic in the population and did not conform with the analyses of the provincial Central Laboratory of the Ministry of Health which had determined that, \"although the Bah\u00eda Blanca network water is not drinkable from a physical/chemical standpoint, no microbial contamination that could cause infectious diseases was detected.\"52\n\nIbid., Exhibit 104.\n\n125.\n\nThe Claimant points out that, as reported in the press, the Governor invited the citizens not to pay the bills, and that the ORAB ordered ABA to discount the invoices from April 12 until the ORAB deemed the drinking water to meet quality standards. The Claimant alleges that the ORAB took this action bowing to political pressure even if the president of the ORAB had indicated to the press that there were no grounds for a penalty because the quality parameters were in accordance with the standards defined in the bidding terms and conditions.53 On April 28, 2000, the ORAB, by Resolution 24/00, prevented ABA from invoicing any amounts until the service was normalized. The prohibition was lifted by Resolution 33/00, dated May 8, 2000. On May 18, 2000, at the request of MOSP, the Provincial Domestic Trade Bureau forbade ABA from invoicing and collecting for services until water quality was deemed acceptable to users.\n\nIbid., p. 82.\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimant notes that this action was taken under the Consumer Defense Act which applies to situations not covered by a specific regulatory framework, and disputes the authority of the Provincial Domestic Trade Bureau to issue this measure because the ORAB had exclusive jurisdiction on billing matters. The Claimant also notes that the press reported that the governor was studying the means to remove the ORAB officials responsible for the decision to allow ABA to receive payments when the service was not in good condition and that a lawsuit was filed against these officials.54 Under such pressure, ABA agreed with the ORAB to extend the service discount from May 5 to May 31, 2000 but stating that it did not accept responsibility for the water problems and reserved the right to seek reimbursement for its damages from the Province. On June 2000, the ORAB issued Resolution 43/00 ordering a 100% discount on invoices for services provided in Bah\u00eda Blanca and Punta Alta from April 12 through May 31, 2000.55\n\nIbid., Exhibit 127.\n\nIbid., p. 83.\n\n127.\n\nThe Committee of Control for Privatized Public Services and Companies, and the Consumer and User Defense Committee of the Provincial Legislature held hearings on the algae incident. According to the Claimant, ABA, MOSP and the ORAB were summoned to appear before said committees. MOSP and the ORAB arranged for a separate meeting closed to the public. In that meeting, the MOSP Minister stated:\n\n\"We are aware that, in association with the ORAB, we have forced certain decisions that are of a political nature, particularly by requesting the ORAB to apply a resolution whereby the Concessionaire is to receive no payment for each day in which water supply quality is not as agreed; by doing so, we breached the concession agreement, and this was a political decision. We took a step further beyond the general meaning of the agreement itself.\"56\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the MOSP Minister also recognized that the problems that occurred had pld causes and the Mayor of Bah\u00eda Blanca attributed them to the lack of investments for many years.57\n\nIbid., p. 84, quote from the parliamentary record.\n\nIbid., p.85.\n\n128.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, the Respondent recalls that, according to Circular 31(A), 98% of the works had been completed. This percentage reflected the fact that the Micro-Screening Plant of the Paso de las Piedras dam had been refurbished and started up by June 23, 1998, and on December 9, 1998 eight additional filters were released for use.58 The Respondent points out that Azurix was aware of the condition of the works at the time it submitted the bid for the Concession and ABA had taken over the operation of the service, including algae treatment.59\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 605-606.\n\nIbid., para. 607 and ff.\n\n129.\n\nThe Respondent explains that, under the Concession Agreement, the Concessionaire was responsible for carrying out all tasks to guarantee efficient provision to users, the protection of public health and the rational use of resources, and it was specifically responsible for the quality of unfiltered water and the quality and quantity of drinking water. The Respondent further notes that the Concessionaire was also responsible for the quality of unfiltered and drinking water taken from the Paso de las Piedras dam. The Respondent affirms, based on Article 1 of Exhibit O to the Concession Agreement, that \"even when the Province was in charge of the operation and maintenance of the Dique Paso de las Piedras dam, the latter was explicitly exempted from any responsibility regarding the 'quality and quantity of water delivered' to the Concessionaire.\"60\n\nIbid., para. 624.\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that ABA infringed the biological parameters for drinking water required in the Concession Agreement. The Respondent points out that the audit report ordered by the ORAB stated that all water coming from superficial sources is susceptible of being treated for human consumption and what varies is the intensity of the required treatment. The same report considered that the Concessionaire managed the crisis in an improvised and imprudent manner and the measures adopted by ABA were not technically suitable to remedy the problem and, hence, the ORAB imposed a fine for not non-compliance with its obligations under the Concession Agreement.61\n\nIbid., para. 643 and ff.\n\n131.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that a crisis in the drinking water supply is a serious and alarming event for the community and, if the image of ABA deteriorated in the eyes of the users, it was because of the negligent manner in which ABA addressed the problem.62\n\nIbid., paras. 650-651.\n\n132.\n\nIn its Reply, Azurix alleges that the Province did not disclose to the bidders information in its possession related to the reservoir situation and points out that Argentina fails to recognize that the April 2000 algae bloom was an extraordinary occurrence that ABA could not predict or avoid on the basis of the information or assets under its management.63\n\nReply, para. 318 and ff.\n\n133.\n\nAzurix contests Argentina's assertion that since the beginning ABA was in charge of algae treatment operations. Azurix recalls that the Algae Removal Works were the exclusive responsibility of the Province, and the works that concerned the Patagonia plant were never completed. Furthermore, ABA could not avoid operating this plant in its existing condition because of its critical importance. Azurix also explains in this context that it needed the ORAB's prior permission for any operation to be carried out in connection with the Algae Removal Works and to access the Micro Filtration Plant facilities. The Claimant notes that this plant was never transferred to ABA and ABA was involved in its operation during the algae crisis in order to take emergency measures.64\n\nIbid., para. 326 and ff.\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the interpretation of the Concession Agreement by the Province and argues that Article 3.6.1 only applied to raw water sources under ABA's management and considers it nonsensical the extension of ABA's obligation to sources exclusively controlled and operated by the Province. In fact, according to the Claimant, none of the action that could have prevented the algae incident was under ABA's control: the Province had exclusive control of the dam and reservoir, could control agricultural run-off into the reservoir, fail to complete the Algae Removal Works and lowered the water level of the reservoir favoring algae blooms.65\n\nIbid., para. 335.\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimant explains that the fine imposed by the ORAB on account of the algae incident was imposed after the service had been transferred to the Province more than two years after the algae bloom event and four days before the deadline for filing petitions in ABA's bankruptcy proceedings. The Claimant also points out that the fine was in excess of the amounts permitted under the Concession Agreement. Azurix contests the grounds on which the fine was imposed. Azurix argues that the guidelines values in Table IV of Annex C to the Concession Agreemnt are only reference values in line with the World Health Organization (WHO)'s recommendations and that the Respondent turns them in strict limits.66\n\nIbid., para. 339 and ff.\n\n136.\n\nThe Claimant affirms that ABA took all measures required to remedy or mitigate the effects of the situation caused by the Province and that at no time was there any risk to public health, and observes that the Respondent relies exclusively on the audit report prepared by the ORAB to argue that ABA was negligent in dealing with the crisis. Azurix further observes that such report is not reliable given the lack of independence of the ORAB from the Province's political will.67\n\nIbid., para. 344-345.\n\n137.\n\nThe Claimant contests the Respondent's assertion that ABA voluntarily gave a discount to customers and affirms that ABA was forced by the ORAB to apply such discount to the water bills.68 Furthermore, it is unacceptable to Azurix that public statements by officials with a view \"to inciting fear, uncertainty and even violence against ABA\" be described by the Respondent as \"the free exercise of a democratic society's rights.\"69\n\nIbid., paras. 346-347.\n\nIbid., para. 352.\n\n138.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, Argentina reiterates in substance its previous arguments, mainly, that at the time of the bidding for the Concession the Algae Removal Works were 98% completed, that Azurix and ABA were aware of the condition of the works and submitted themselves to Section 2.4 of the Bidding Conditions,70 that Azurix inspected the works before submitting its offer, that since the beginning of the Concession ABA was in practice responsible for the operation of the Service and the treatment of the algae, that the Concessionaire was responsible for the quantity and quality of raw water from the Paso de las Piedras dam even if the operation and maintenance was under the charge of the Province, that Table IV of Exhibit C to the Concession Agreement required that the drinking water had no phytoplankton and zooplankton, and that failure to meet these biological parameters meant that the ORAB was required to impose a fine.71\n\nThis section provides, *inter alia*, that bidders by the fact of submitting a bid recognize that they had sufficient access to information to prepare it correctly and that the bid was based exclusively on their own investigation and evaluation.\n\nRejoinder, para. 630 and ff.\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the community unrest was not due to intervention of provincial officials, as claimed by Azurix, on the contrary, these officials were responding to the population concern over the foul smelling and tasting water. The Respondent argues that Azurix has admitted as much by recounting how the problem with the water smell and taste had \"gradually attracted the attention of politicians and journalists and became an issue widely covered by the media.\"72\n\nIbid., para. 636 and ff. Quote from p. 79 of the Memorial.\n\n***(ii) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe allegations of the parties relate to their understanding of the Concession Agreement, the causes of the algae incident and the reaction of the provincial authorities.\n\n141.\n\nIt is a matter of dispute between the parties whether the Concessionaire was responsible for the quantity and quality of the water from a source not under its management. The dispute relates to whether Article 3.6.1 of the Concession Agreement applies to the raw water supplied from the Paso de las Piedras reservoir. The Tribunal notes that this Article does not differentiate between sources of raw water and Annex O specifically exempts the Province from responsibility from the quantity and quality of water supplied from said reservoir.\n\n142.\n\nIt is also disputed between the parties whether the Concessionaire breached the biological parameters set forth in Annex C to the Concession Agreement. The Tribunal has difficulty with the Claimant's understanding of the wording of Annex C and the concordant provisions in the Concession Agreement. Article 3.6.2 is very clear in requiring that the Concessionaire meet the parameters established in Annex C and in specifying that in all cases the failure to meet the technical parameters shall be considered a potential risk for the public health.\n\n143.\n\nHowever, the Concession Agreement was based on certain factual assumptions that did not turn out to be correct. It is not contested that the Algae Removal Works were not completed notwithstanding that at the time of bidding for the Concession they were represented to be 98% complete and expected to be completed by April 1999, at least two months before the beginning of the Concession and a full year before the extraordinary algae bloom occurred. The reservoir was kept by the Province only 25% full to permit completion of the works. In turn the low water level contributed to the extraordinary nature of the algae bloom. The works undertaken by the Province had the objective to obtain treated water at the outlet of the Patagonia plant with \"levels of the chlorophyll photosynthetic pigment below 1mg/m3, irrespective of the species or number of cells, pH, etc. present in the water.\" This objective was not achieved. The filters installed at the micro-filtering plant were inadequate for filtering algae, a fact on which the ORAB and the consultants of Azurix agreed. The Bah\u00eda Blanca Drinking Water Supply Monitoring Report prepared by the ORAB noted that it had not found domestic or international precedents where these micro-filtering systems were used for the primary elimination of this type of plankton organisms.73 Similarly, the report prepared by the consulting firm JVP employed by ABA concluded that the direct filtration system at Paso de las Piedras was not fit for the treatment of water because of the high concentration of algae/chlorophyll reaching the Patagonia plant due to the properties of the water from the reservoir and the removal capacity of the micro-screens system.74 Since August 1999, ABA had repeatedly advised the ORAB, to no avail, of the measures necessary for ABA to take possession of the Algae Removal Works. For instance, in a letter to the ORAB dated August 24, 1999 (less than two months into the Concession and eight months before the April 2000 incidents) ABA alerted the ORAB that there was an increase in \"the algae problem\" due to the unusual low level in the reservoir.75 In the same vein, ECODYMA, the contractor engaged by AGOSBA to carry out the Algae Removal Works, wrote to the General Administrator of Sanitary Works of the Province on July 19, 1999 to bring to her attention that the quality of the water of the reservoir did not meet the standards used as a base for its bid because of the high level of turbidity of the water and the algae bloom in large number and variety.76\n\nHalcrow Report, p. 32. Exhibit 90 to the Memorial.\n\nIbid., p.33.\n\nExhibit 94 to the Memorial.\n\nExhibit 95 to the Memorial.\n\n144.\n\nGiven this factual situation, the reaction of the provincial authorities shows a total disregard for their own contribution to the algae crisis and a readiness to blame the Concessionaire for situations that were caused by years of disinvestment and to use the incident politically, as admitted by the MOSP Minister in hearings held by commissions of the provincial parliament on the algae incident. It equally shows the willingness of high placed provincial officials, including the Governor, to interfere in the operation of the Concession for political gain whether by forcing ABA not to bill the customers or threatening the staff of the ORAB for lifting the billing interdiction. These actions by the Province are clearly actions taken in use of its public authority and go beyond the contractual rights as a party to the Concession Agreement. The Tribunal understands that governments have to be vigilant and protect the public health of their citizens but the statements and actions of the provincial authorities contributed to the crisis rather than assisted in solving it.\n\n***(b) Moctezuma***\n-------------------\n\n***(i) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nAs explained by the Claimant in its Memorial, the works as described in Circular 31(A) included two elements: \"Drilling Construction Works\" and \"Construction of Aqueduct and Injection Pipelines\". These works were only 10% and 25% completed according to Circular 31(A). The drilling component consisted of drilling 16 wells capable of extracting 300 m\u00b3 per hour. Under the drilling contract, AGOSBA had the right to reject the work performed if the water flow was lower than 50% of the required capacity or the water did not meet sanitary requirements. The aqueduct was intended to transport water from Moctezuma to the cistern in Carlos Casares for delivery to this town and the town of Pehuaj\u00f3. These works were to be completed in 18 months, by June or early July 2000.\n\n146.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, on March 14, 2000, AGOSBA informed the ORAB that there would be a two-month delay and the works would be completed by September 2000. The dateline was postponed further and the Claimant finds it disconcerting that the ORAB, instead of pressing the Province to fulfill its obligations, informed ABA that \"Azurix [sic] cannot assert completion of works as the grounds of non-compliance of the parameters for water quality in such localities.\"77 The completion occurred nearly 18 months after the original completion date and after ABA had terminated the Concession. The Claimant explains that ABA was willing to accept the works provisionally subject to a technical and functional evaluation and that the evaluation performed on January 3, 2002 showed that the works were unsuitable for the purpose and were not accepted by ABA. In particular, the wells could supply only a third to half the agreed water flow.78\n\nIbid., pp. 89-90.\n\nIbid., pp. 90-91.\n\n147.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, Argentina describes a different situation. It refers to the study submitted by ABA to the ORAB in May 2000 where it acknowledges that the wells have been drilled and 13 km. of aqueduct completed. In the same study, ABA recommended to cut the extraction of water by 50% to preserve the geological reserves. The works were completed and ABA was notified on October 2, 2001. ABA accepted the works provisionally on October 10 because it had terminated the Concession on October 5. The civil works were completed by end of August but the electricity connection could not be installed because of flooding in the area. The External Audit of September 2001 presented by ABA to the ORAB states that access to some drillings was not gained because they were in a flooded area. The works were not essential to meet service quality targets because of the 3-year exemption in Annex F of the Concession related to physical and chemical parameters of water quality. ABA was never penalized nor has Azurix claimed any damages on this account.\n\n148.\n\nIn its Reply, Azurix points out that Argentina has failed to mention that the wells were expected to solve quantity of water issues and not only quality, and that the quality of the water did not comply with the parameters originally provided in the work specifications.79 The fact that there was no deadline in Circular 31(A) does not mean that this Circular can be considered in isolation of the contracts and specifications for the works in question. The flooding only took place after April 15, 2001, more than eight months after the expiration of the deadline and after the works had been suspended because of lack of payment to the contractor.80 Azurix maintains that ABA did not even accept the works provisionally but \"subject to the conditions mentioned in Note GRP 1882/01, particularly its completion in accordance with the specifications and the contract signed for their execution\u2026\"81 As already pointed out, the ORAB warned ABA that non-completion of the works in Moteczuma could not be used as excuses for noncompliance with water quality parameters. The ORAB also determined that there was decreased pressure in the cities of Pehuaj\u00f3 and Carlos Casares and ordered ABA to solve this issue. ABA had to drill five new wells, implement a pumping scheme to optimize drinking water distribution in Pehuaj\u00f3, and started the construction of an arsenic treatment plant because the Moctezuma wells failed to meet the standard required in relation to arsenic levels.82 According to the Claimant, the worst part was the damage to the image of ABA among the customers since the works had been presented by the Province as the solution to the water problems of the previous 40 years and created high expectations among the authorities and local people.\n\nReply, para. 355.\n\nIbid., paras. 365-366.\n\nIbid., para. 368.\n\nIbid., p. 120 footnotes 382 and 383.\n\n149.\n\nArgentina in its Rejoinder claims that the temporary acceptance of the works on October 10, 2001 was linked to the unilateral termination of the Concession 5 days earlier and that the additional works and studies claimed to have been necessary because of the deficient Moctezuma works were already included in the Five-Year Plan presented by ABA to the ORAB in November 1999. No fine was ever imposed on ABA related to the alleged consequences of the Moctezuma works on ABA's delivery of services. The only fines were related to the interruption of service because of breakage of the Nueve de Julio aqueduct on May 2 and June 29, 2000 because of improper operating procedures. The breakage happened before the original delivery dates.83\n\nRejoinder, para. 661.\n\n***(ii) Considerations by the Tribunal***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n150.\n\nIt is accepted by the parties that the works were late. It is clear from the evidence presented that the works stopped first because the contractor was not paid by the Province and later because of flooding. It is also clear that the quantity of the water that could be extracted from the wells was below expectations. For the Tribunal this is a simple contractual matter not involving the exercise of the provincial public authority.\n\n***(c) Polo Petroqu\u00edmico (\"Polo\")***\n------------------------------------\n\n***(i) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nAGOSBA had entered into an agreement with Prof\u00e9rtil and the Province for the supply of industrial water for a fertilizer plant under construction. The water supply contract was assigned to ABA as part of its takeover of the Concession. To meet the water requirements, the Province had started construction of an aqueduct which was listed as 95% complete in Circular 31(A). Azurix claims that the Province failed to deliver the aqueduct. In a letter of August 25, 1999 to ABA and AGOSBA, Prof\u00e9rtil noted the defects \"in the construction and design of the Industrial Aqueduct and the inferior quality of the equipment and materials used\". In January 2000, ABA informed Prof\u00e9rtil that the aqueduct did not meet the requirements to provide the service and it would not be possible to supply Prof\u00e9rtil with the quantity and quality of water agreed by the Province. Azurix received the Industrial Aqueduct in March 2000 provisionally and subject to \"final acceptance upon the satisfactory result of routine technical evaluation and the Province assuming full responsibility for any service failures not caused by ABA\".84 On August 2000, the Province, Prof\u00e9rtil, PBB and Polisur (other industries in the Polo) signed a letter of intent to construct a new pipeline. Azurix considers this fact as an admission that the existing aqueduct was \"not fit for its intended purpose\". Azurix lists a series of steps that it took to minimize the deficiencies of the aqueduct, including the building of a by-pass between the aqueduct and an existing water pipeline, and supplying the companies in the Polo with industrial water while bearing the cost of the raw water paid to the Province.85\n\nMemorial, p. 92.\n\nIbid., pp. 93-94.\n\n152.\n\nArgentina points out that pursuant to Article 15.4.1 of the Concession Agreement, the contracts signed by OSBA listed in Annex N would be transferred to the Concessionaire. Circular 39(B), item 2, Annex O, established guidelines for the supply of industrial water to the companies in the Polo. The guidelines established the price to be paid to the Province and the responsibility of the Province for the amount of water delivered. The quality of the water should be that of water in its natural state at the Paso de las Piedras dam treated at the micro-screening plant.86 The President of the ORAB informed ABA about the transfer of the aqueduct on March 28, 2000. In the \"Inventory of Fixed Assets\" of ABA, the aqueduct was listed as an asset assigned to the Concession with April 15, 2000 as \"Date of Origin\" and in excellent condition.87 Argentina argues that ABA tried to generate conflicts with Prof\u00e9rtil because it did not consider the contract advantageous, and with the Province to renegotiate the Concession.88\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 196.\n\nIbid., para. 698.\n\nIbid., paras. 699-704.\n\n153.\n\nAzurix in its Reply reaffirms that the poor condition of the work prevented adequate service provision to the industries in the Polo. In addition, the deficient operation of the dam affected the quality of the water to such an extent that ABA could not \"invoice the industrial water it delivered in order not to become committed to an operation that it could not guarantee through the Province's facilities\".89 Furthermore, the commercial negotiations that ABA may have held with the industries of the Polo are alien to the issues raised by Azurix. There is no doubt that the deficiencies experienced by the aqueduct created a negative image of ABA in the eyes of the industries located in the Polo.90\n\nReply, para. 384.\n\nIbid., para. 388.\n\n154.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, Argentina reaffirms its previous arguments on the assignment of the contract and ABA's acceptance of the aqueduct. If ABA had made investments to ensure the continuity of service, it is because ABA considered it necessary to comply with its obligations. They are not the Province's or Argentina's responsibility.\n\n***(ii) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the fact that the Province agreed to build a new aqueduct proves that the one delivered to the Concessionaire was inadequate. The tests conducted by ABA, which have not been disputed by Argentina, provide also evidence of the low level of pressure acceptance by the water pipeline. The letter of August 1999 from Profertil to AGOSBA and ABA speaks by itself and its content has not been refuted by Argentina. However, this is a matter of a contractual nature that does not go beyond the relationship between the parties to the Concession Agreement acting as such.\n\n***(d) Florencio Varela***\n--------------------------\n\n***(i) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n156.\n\nThis component of work in progress for which AGOSBA took responsibility consisted of drilling four wells. According to the drilling contract, the wells were to be completed in 180 days from the date of the contract, December 30, 1998. Circular 31(A) stated that the wells were 70% completed, which Azurix disputes. Azurix alleges that the Province failed to deliver the wells and hence it was impossible to keep up with the summer water demands and such failure caused service interruptions. On December 27, 1999, the ORAB ordered ABA \"to conform the service to the established service levels within 24 hours\". To comply, ABA \"took control of the Florencio Varela Extraction Wells on a provisional basis in order to begin providing water service to the local citizens\".91 On December 28, 1999, ABA explained to the ORAB that the Province's failure to complete the wells made it impossible for ABA to comply with its obligations to provide water service. ABA's first Annual Report noted that the drilling ended before reaching the aquifer \"to avoid more complicated works, which rendered said works useless\".92\n\nMemorial, p. 96.\n\nIbid., p. 97.\n\n157.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the wells were \"practically completed\" at the end of July 1999 and the final measurement was carried out. ABA\u2019s Service Report states that the wells were available for service. The wells were included in the inventory of assets on June 15, 1999. The wells needed to be supplemented with the pertinent interconnection pipes. Their installation was the responsibility of the Concessionaire. ABA\u2019s Annual Progress Report on the POES and Service levels for the year July 1999-June 2000 includes at least three of the wells in the actual service provision. In any case, ABA did not suffer any damages nor did the ORAB impose any penalties.93\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras.706-717.\n\n158.\n\nIn its Reply, Azurix finds that Argentina has failed to address the evidence presented in the Memorial. Azurix notes that it took five months for the ORAB to authorize ABA to assume operation of the Florencio Varela wells, to conduct tests, to adapt them and to complete them in order to address the summer increased demands.94 Azurix contests the significance of the quoted reports and the measurement statement. According to Azurix, the purpose of the Service Report was \"to evaluate the condition of the water system *'at the time of ABA\u2019s take over of the Concession\".*95 The Report noted that the four wells were not in operation and the equipment was missing. The date of origin in the Fixed Assets Inventory does not have the relevance that Argentina attributes to it. Date of origin is merely a technical term that does not explain why the ORAB did not authorize ABA to take material possession till December 27, 1999. Prior delivery of the wells was essential for the installation of the water pipes. Once ABA obtained the authorization, it immediately proceeded to complete them at its own expense and connect them to the network. Only three wells were put in operation, the fourth could not be used due to construction problems, was abandoned and new drillings had to be made at ABA\u2019s own expense.96\n\nReply, para. 390.\n\nIbid., para. 393. Emphasis in the original.\n\nIbid., paras. 394-395 and footnote 429.\n\n159.\n\nIn the Rejoinder Argentina contends that the completion of the works during the first month of the Concession was duly proved by Argentina. Argentina points out that Azurix quoted only partially from the Service Report which stated that \"only the ducted well was available. The equipment is missing. The equipment is stored at the 'Centro' operating location\".97 Contrary to Azurix's allegations, it was not necessary to equip the wells to interconnect them. In any case, no fine was imposed since no fines could be imposed during the first six months of the Concession.98\n\nRejoinder, para. 679.\n\nIbid., para. 686.\n\n***(ii) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n-----------------------------------------\n\n160.\n\nFrom the parties allegations it emerges that Argentina does not contest that ABA was authorized to use the wells on December 27. The inventory of fixed assets showing the wells as an asset added on June 15, 1999 indicates that assets were added before work was completed or were in service. On June 15, the Concession Agreement had not been signed yet and there is no dispute that, on that date, the works were not completed. Argentina claims the works were completed in July and ABA claims never to have accepted them. There is no dispute that only three out of the four original wells went into service and that they produced low water flow. The certificate of measurement of July 20, 1999 simply recorded the fact that the final measurement took place and it is signed by OSBA and the Contractor. Hazen & Sawyer (\"H&S\") stated that: \"The concessionaire had to unilaterally take over the unfinished wells from AGOSBA and to put them into production before they were formally transferred as stipulated in ABA's concession contract\".99 There seems to be a difference of view between simply executing the works and accepting them as works satisfactorily completed under the terms of the civil works contract concerned. ABA considered works completed when accepted in terms of the specifications in the contract, while the Province seems to have been concerned with the physical completion of the works even if they did not meet the contract specifications. The Tribunal concludes from these considerations that that this is a matter in which the Province did not exercise its public authority and acted as any other contractual party.\n\nExhibit 163 to the Memorial, pp. 2-11.\n\n**4. Rejection of Financing by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (\"OPIC\")**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nAzurix submits that, in the privatization of public water systems, the private investor usually needs to compensate for under-investment in the infrastructure during the previous State-run operation.100 ABA estimated that it would need $311 million to comply with the POES goals. ABA contacted OPIC and the Inter-American Development Bank (\"IDB\") to obtain $100 and $150 million loans, respectively, in the fall of 1999. In April 2000, both institutions expressed interest in providing financing and in May 2000 Azurix submitted formal applications.101 These institutions engaged H&S to perform a comprehensive due diligence investigation of the Concession and H&S staff visited Argentina in August 2000. During a second visit in October 2000, H&S focused primarily on ascertaining \"how the Provincial authorities viewed the ongoing development of the Concession and what role the Province would play in promoting investment security and stability over the course of the Concession\".102 On September 21, 2001, OPIC rejected formally the application. The letter described the issues identified by their due diligence that required \"clear and definitive resolution to ensure the concession\u2019s long-term viability and render it an acceptable credit capable of borrowing funds.\"\n\nMemorial, p. 98.\n\nIbid., p. 101.\n\nIbid., p. 103\n\n162.\n\nThe issues identified by H&S were uncertainty on tariffs, substantial scope of the capital plan required to meet the service goals compared to the level of cash ABA is expecting to generate from forecasted revenues based on tariffs in place, lack of clear definition of roles or responsibilities and unclear commitment of the Province to the Concession given unmet obligations.103 The letter concluded:\n\n\"We understand that since our meeting in Argentina during November 2000, ABA has continued discussions with ORAB and Buenos Aires Provincial government and no significant progress has been made regarding the core issues related to tariff setting and the capital expenditures program. From a creditworthiness perspective, this failure to reach an agreement regarding modifications to the concession to restore a sustainable situation for ABA precludes us from moving forward with potential financing.\"\n\nIbid., pp. 107-108 and Exhibit 173.\n\n163.\n\nAccording to Azurix, the denial of financing by OPIC made it impossible to obtain long-term financing from other sources. It meant that Azurix would have to fund ABA's operational expenses itself.104\n\nMemorial, p. 109.\n\n164.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, Argentina alleges that Azurix was always short of funding. Argentina points out that Azurix prepared an IPO to obtain funds that it could not obtain otherwise but that the IPO funds benefited ENRON instead. Furthermore, the World Bank denied funding to Azurix in Ghana because of its totally non-transparent policy. In any case, Azurix was responsible for obtaining funding, and it was its decision where to find it whether using its own capital or becoming indebted to multilateral institutions or other entities.105\n\nCounter-Memorial, pp. 162-167.\n\n165.\n\nAzurix contests the assertions of Argentina on financing, the link of OPIC financing to the denial of a World Bank loan to Ghana and the lack of resources. Azurix draws attention to the fact that the denial of financing in Ghana took place in March 2000 while OPIC and the IDB expressed interest in providing financing in April and June 2000. The H&S report in January 2001 did not mention the issue and the letter of OPIC sent on September 21, 2001 neither.106\n\nReply, para. 284.\n\n166.\n\nArgentina points out in its Rejoinder that the conflicts that eventually led OPIC to deny funding were generated by Azurix itself. The notification of Azurix on January 5, 2001 of a dispute under the BIT would have affected the denial of funding by OPIC. Argentina adds another instance of funding denial not mentioned by Azurix. ABA requested a US$50 million loan from ENOHSA under an IDB-financed program. The loan was denied because the lender requested the guarantee of ENRON or a suitable bank guarantee, which ABA could not provide. ABA was notified on September 21, 2001, the same date as OPIC's letter, and no reference was made to any conduct or omissions by the Province or the Regulatory Agency but to lack of plans, excessive budgets, lack of environmental impact assessments, etc.\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe rejection of the loan by OPIC was very clear and specific in its reasons. The World Bank was not mentioned nor ENRON. The Tribunal has no reason to second guess the management of OPIC in its reasoning for rejecting the request. As regards the ENOHSA loan, ENRON was not prepared to guarantee the loan as required by Banco de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina, the administrator of the program. By September 21, 2001, ABA had already requested the Province to cure its noncompliance with the Concession Agreement. Evidently, each institution had a different choice of reasons for denying funding. For the Tribunal, the significance of the reasons given by OPIC and the due diligence analysis on which they are based stems from the fact that OPIC is unrelated to any of the parties involved and the consultants hired to do the due diligence had no allegiance to any of the parties to this proceeding. The H&S report shows that the lack of funding for ABA could not be attributed to the relationship of Azurix with ENRON or to whichever denial of funding by the World Bank. H&S\u2019s assessment noted the politicization of the Concession, the lack of commitment of the provincial authorities to the Concession, and the impact of those two factors on its viability. However, these were not the only reasons adduced by OPIC to reject Azurix\u2019s financing request. OPIC\u2019s letter also referred to \"the substantial scope of the capital plan required to meet the service goals of the concession in terms of both aggressive timing and cost, as compared to the level of cash ABA is expecting to generate from forecasted revenues based on tariffs currently in effect.\"107 In other words, the current tariff level was insufficient to sustain the scope of the capital plan.\n\nExhibit 173 to the Memorial.\n\n**5. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)**\n----------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nOn January 5, 2001, the Claimant notified Argentina of the existence of a dispute under the BIT. According to the Claimant, at that point the Province renewed its discussions with ABA to remedy the breaches of the Concession Agreement, and on February 15, 2001 the MOSP and ABA signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The Claimant alleges that:\n\n\"the MOU implicitly recognized that the guarantees given by the Privatization Commission (including Circular 52(A) were essential to the attraction of qualified investors. Moreover, it implicitly recognized that the Province, as the granting authority, had the ability to revisit the purpose and goals of the Concession Agreement to optimize intended social purposes. Finally, and importantly, it recognized implicitly that the economic equilibrium of the contract was broken. These principles were incorporated into the MOU under the mutual understanding by ABA and the Province that the economic equilibrium of the Concession needed to be restored.\"108\n\nMemorial, pp.120-121.\n\n169.\n\nTo implement the goals of the MOU a committee was established (\"the MOU Committee\"). This committee had to produce an interim report of the negotiations within 30 days and a resolution of the issues outlined in 60 days. During the discussions, the MOSP Undersecretary took the view that the Canon was subject to business risk and he proposed an amortization scheme as a percentage over sales and the remaining unamortized value to be recovered through the re-bidding of subdivided areas of the Concession. According to the Claimant, throughout the discussions \"the approach of the MOSP was centered on questioning the privatization process and discarding key assurances that had been provided to ABA\", and the affirmation that the Concession was based on the risk principle.109 The Claimant alleges that by the end of the negotiating period \"the repeated promises that the Province made to cure the outstanding breaches related to the application of the tariff regime remained unfulfilled\" and the Province opted for deferring ABA's rights under the Concession. Thus as told by Mr. Clark, a member of the MOU Committee representing ABA, in his witness statement:\n\n\"As a condition to the signing of MOU II, the Province asked Azurix to withdraw its arbitral claim with ICSID and to release the Province from any claims... when ABA stressed the urgent need to increase cash flow, the Province responded that ABA should address this at the first tariff review at the end of the five-year period \u2026 ABA was not in a position to wait until the end of the five-year period, and needed immediate solutions to the threat of its financial collapse.\"110\n\nIbid., pp. 123 and 125.\n\nIbid., quote in pp. 126-127.\n\n170.\n\nThe Claimant summarizes the MOU process results by affirming that by September 2001 the promises made by the Province to resolve the tariff issues were conditioned to withdrawal of the arbitration claim and the renunciation to recover the Canon, \"In essence, after nearly a year of pursuing the rectification of Provincial breaches through the MOU efforts, nothing had changed to make the Concession economically viable. The breaches of the Concession Agreement, which affected the viability of Azurix's investment, were still uncured.\"111 According to the Claimant, this situation prompted ABA to consider the termination of the Concession Agreement due to the Province's continuous breaches.\n\nIbid., p. 127.\n\n171.\n\nFrom the Respondent's point of view, the MOU was simply an agreement to create a committee to look into possible negotiating procedures.112 It was \"a negotiating process in which the parties, regardless of the rights to which they are legally entitled or for which they may have a rightful claim, try to reach a sustainable understanding for the Concession Contract within the framework of Law No. 11,820 and the rules and regulations applicable to the service.\"113\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 494.\n\nIbid., para. 495.\n\n172.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that no agreement was reached in the context of the MOU negotiations because ABA adopted an unyielding position to be released of its obligations and transfer entrepreneurial risk to the Province. As a result, no proposals were ever submitted to the MOSP as it had been foreseen in Article 2 of the MOU, and the quality and expansion targets in the Concession Agreement and in the approved First Five-Year Plan were never modified.114\n\nIbid., paras. 497-498.\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe MOU was part of a process to revisit certain aspects of the Concession. Its purpose and function was to conduct \"the joint analysis of the issues\" listed in Section 2 of the MOU. All items listed are couched in terms of work to be done \u2013 studies, discussions, preparation of a \"regulatory model\" - except for the second item \u2013 POES goals (Section 2.2) \u2013 which in part is drafted as a decision to establish, right there and then, a \"priority works\" plan to be performed during the current year because \"the current critical service condition cannot be resolved by goals based contracts.\" (2.2, first paragraph) A detailed plan of works and actions for 2001 was attached as an exhibit to the MOU.\n\n174.\n\nThe second paragraph of Section 2.2 recognizes the need to revise the goals of the POES in view of Resolution 179/00 of the MOSP and Resolution 59/00 of the ORAB which established sanitary vulnerability, risk and access criteria. The third paragraph of this section entrusts the ORAB with the control and regulation of the service \"by following up on the Priority Works Plan.\"\n\n175.\n\nThe MOU was signed by the Minister of Public Works and Services and the General Manager of the Concessionaire in the presence of the Secretary General of FENTOS and the Secretary General of SOSBA and city mayors, all of whom acknowledged the contents by subscribing the exhibit on works and actions for 2001. The signature took place also in presence of members of the provincial Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n176.\n\nWhile the Respondent has played down the importance and significance of the MOU, it seems that it reflected a moment in which the parties were prepared to give serious consideration to the problems that had surfaced during the first year of the Concession. The level of the positions held by the persons who signed it and the context of the signature ceremony show the importance that the parties attached to the MOU. In particular this is significant for the decision to establish the Priority Works Plan and have it subscribed by the city mayors. At least in this respect, the MOU was more than a simple agreement to establish a committee as has been submitted by the Respondent. The Tribunal will now consider the implications of the MOU for purposes of assessing the performance of the Concessionaire against the POES in 2001.\n\n**6. The Program for Optimizing and Expanding Service (POES)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent points out in its Counter-Memorial that the Claimant had failed to comply with the POES, the core of the Concession. It argues that as part of the POES, the Concessionaire presented a Five-Year Plan proposal with serious shortcomings because from the very beginning it knew that it would not fulfill its obligations. As early as June 2000, ABA tried to reformulate the POES so as not to comply with the Five-Year Plan. The POES obligations were enforceable from the beginning and the MOU did not exempt ABA from complying with them. ABA did not meet the POES goals and investment commitments to such an extent that it prompted the Province to impose fines and terminate the Concession Agreement by fault of the Concessionaire.\n\n178.\n\nIn response, the Claimant alleges that the Province failed to provide accurate information to the Concessionaire necessary to define the POES goals and delayed approval of these goals for so long that they were no longer relevant. According to the Claimant, the POES goals were superseded by the MOU which recognized that \"the economic equilibrium of the concession had been materially altered, and the parties agreed to a finite Priority Work Plan to replace the POES.\"115 Furthermore, the compliance with the POES was subject to certain pre-conditions, such as the proper application of the tariff regime and the cooperation of the Province and the ORAB with the Concessionaire.\n\nReply, para. 402.\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that the provincial authorities failed to provide the Concessionaire with complete and accurate information for purposes of the definition, presentation and subsequent performance of the First Five-Year Plan. The documents promised in Circular 66(A) were not delivered to the extent promised and ABA had to request information on, among others, updated network plans, business documentation, computer center documentation, billing unit records and documents, information and documents related to personnel, debits and credits and technical operating documentation. The documentation requested was never delivered to ABA notwithstanding that it existed: \"lt was held by former AGOSBA officials - closely connected to the Union - who sought to require ABA to enter into commercial arrangements to acquire the same information that should have been delivered by the Province at the takeover.\"116\n\nIbid., para. 428.\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that it presented the Five-Year Plan diligently given the circumstances and that delays in its approval occurred by factors not mentioned by the Respondent such as the request, on February 23, 2000, three months after filing the Five-Year Plan, for information that was in fact in the hands of former officers of AGOSBA to pressure ABA into arrangements with them, or the introduction of the sanitary risk concept that the Province requested that be included by Resolution No. 59/00 of July 21, 2000. According to the Claimant, the introduction of this concept meant that the Concessionaire was instructed to prioritize investment based on new criteria -accessibility, risks and sanitary vulnerability- and \"with no consideration to the relevant compensation required to preserve the economic balance of the concession.\"117 The Five-Year Plan was not approved until February 21, 2001 by Resolution 11/01.\n\nIbid., para. 445.\n\n181.\n\nThe First Annual POES Progress Report was approved by the ORAB by Resolution 16/02 on February 19, 2002, 18 months after the submission of the Report. According to the Claimant, \"these delays jeopardized the Concessionaire\u2019s performance and evidenced the ORAB\u2019s arbitrary conduct. Furthermore, the lack of certainty and the impossibility to foresee the plan that would be approved by the ORAB or the criteria that would be used to measure compliance with the goals placed ABA in an uncertain situation, which affected its operations.\"118\n\nIbid., para. 463.\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with Argentina's argument that the Priority Work Plan included in the MOU was independent from the POES. For the Claimant, this would mean that ABA would have undertaken new investment obligations in addition to those in the POES notwithstanding that the MOU recognized the economic imbalance of the Concession; it was clear that the MOU suspended the goals for the second year of the Concession.119\n\nIbid., para. 474.\n\n183.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Province, not ABA, sought to modify the POES because of a political shift in how the new provincial government viewed the Concession Agreement. Minister S\u00edcaro had expressed the intent in February 2001 to change the model from one based on objectives to a model based on investments and a return to a cross-subsidy scheme implementing a social tariff for low income users.120\n\nIbid., para. 469.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with the description of POES non-compliance provided by the Respondent. According to the Claimant, the Respondent carries the evaluation without taking into account the non-application of the tariff regime and the agreement on a Priority Work Plan in the MOU. According to the Claimant, the ORAB could never have evaluated compliance with the POES because it had failed to define the methodology to assess the goals of the POES. The Claimant points out that the evaluation is based on investment amounts rather than goals as required in the Concession Agreement, that the analysis of the expansion goals disregards the setbacks concerning determination of serviced populations, excludes the connections installed within the serviced areas, and that includes, as alleged breaches, goals to be reached in a three or five-year term.121\n\nIbid., paras. 480 and 482.\n\n185.\n\nThe Claimant also alleges discriminatory treatment to the extent that public \u2013 ABSA - and private companies \u2013 AGBA - were exempted from POES compliance. According to the Claimant, this exemption was due to the unreasonableness of the POES goals when the Province refused for political reasons to apply the tariff regime. The Claimant points out that, in the case of AGBA, the goals for year 2001 were suspended even though the economic crisis did not start until the end of 2001.122\n\nIbid., para. 407.\n\n186.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the MOU did not operate to amend the Concession Agreement or the targets under the POES, \"it was merely an attempt by the parties to create a committee to consider the issues and submit a proposal designed to overcome certain difficulties, which was never put together\".123 The POES was enforceable from the beginning of the Concession. The quantitative and qualitative targets were established in the Concession Agreement and the Five-Year Plans were merely designed to provide additional details, adjustments or updates.124 The POES and the Five-Year Plans were specific contractual obligations to be discharged in accordance with the terms of the Concession Agreement and were not merely guidelines towards the targets as argued by the Claimant.125 Compliance with the POES was an exclusive obligation of the Concessionaire and the Province did not hinder or affect negatively compliance of ABA with the POES.\n\nRejoinder, para. 327.\n\nIbid., para. 336.\n\nIbid., paras. 339-340.\n\n187.\n\nThe Respondent also contests that the Province discriminated in favor of other companies. AGBA, a private company, had complied with the applicable POES notwithstanding that it had higher targets during the first year of its concession and had only requested, on July 20, 2001, a temporary postponement of the POES deadline for the second year in view of the extraordinary economic crisis of the country. The postponement was not related to the rate system as asserted by the Claimant.126\n\nIbid., paras. 350-375.\n\n188.\n\nAs regards ABSA, the Respondent justifies the exemption from the service expansion obligations because it was owned by the Province, the temporary nature of the service transfer, the fact that the Concession had been abandoned, and the deep crisis prevailing at the time.127\n\nIbid., para. 382.\n\n189.\n\nThe Respondent contests that the Province had any responsibility for the delayed approval of the First Five-Year Plan. It had provided ABA all the necessary information and the delay was the result of the many requests for postponing the submission deadline. The original deadline of three months from the date of takeover of the Concession was first postponed by two months, and then it was extended by an additional 45 days. As this was not yet enough, two further postponements were granted by ORAB. All together these postponements delayed presentation of the draft Five-Year Plan by nearly nine months. It was submitted on June 12, 2000.\n\n190.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, it was always ABA that attempted to change the POES. When ABA was supposed to submit the Five-Year Plan, in fact it submitted an Emergency Investment Plan and sketched the structure of a plan for the five years, there was a second draft Five-Year Plan, an appeal for reversal of Resolution 10/00, a Supplementary Report to the Five-Year Plan, and a letter to ORAB of July 17, 2001.\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the notions of vulnerability, accessibility and sanitation risk did not modify substantially the POES. Inclusion of these notions was to direct the targets already established to areas that were more intensely exposed to sanitation risks.128\n\nIbid., para. 406.\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the MOU was only the first step in a process of renegotiation that was never completed because of ABA's desire to walk away from its obligations and transfer all business risks to the Province. The Priority Work Plan never became effective and it could not have amended the Concession Agreement or changed the targets established in the POES for the second year of the Concession.129\n\nIbid., paras. 409-410.\n\n193.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the obligations under the POES were not conditional upon the definition of evaluation criteria regarding performance under the POES, and the achievement of the targets regarding the expansion of drinking water and sewerage works did not call for any regulatory criterion beyond the terms of the Concession Agreement.130 ABA did not comply with the minimum requirements for region and county during the first two years, the annual renovation and reconditioning of pipes' target, and the target of maintenance or reconditioning of effluent primary and secondary treatment plants. ABA failed to make sufficient progress in the micromeasurement by year two of the Concession to such an extent as to make it unlikely that the 40% target prescribed in the Concession Agreement could be reached by year five. ABA equally failed to complete the infrastructure works contemplated in Exhibit I to the approved Five-Year Plan. In the second year, ABA prepared the second progress annual report for the POES based exclusively on the Priority Works Plan attached to the MOU and hence failed to reach the targets established in Exhibit F of the Concession Agreement.131\n\nIbid., paras. 415 and 418.\n\nIbid., paras. 423-449\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nThe Priority Works Program was not additional to the POES. It is doubtful that, in its financial condition, ABA would have undertaken new obligations in addition to the POES. The sanitary risk was a new element which would have an effect on the POES and was introduced by the Respondent. It is evident that the MOU was an attempt to solve the problems that had developed and the attempt failed. The POES was never amended and the parties to the Concession Agreement continued to be bound by its original terms, including the tariff regime. However, the failure by the Province to honor the tariff regime contributed significantly to Azurix's inability to implement the POES as planned.\n\n**7. Circular 52(A) and Canon Recovery**\n----------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Introduction***\n----------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe issue of Canon recovery and the meaning of Circular 52 (A) first emerged during the discussions in 2001 in the context of the MOU as we have already seen. On July 18, 2001, ABA sent a communication to the Province requesting that the Province cure the breaches of the Concession and warning that, if these were not cured, ABA would terminate the Concession. The Province replied on August 29, 2001 denying any wrongdoing and, in particular, denying \"ABA's right to recover its investment (including the initial Canon), as expressly stated in Circular 52(A) and Article 12.1.1 of the Concession\".132 The controversy is linked to the level of risk assumed by the Concessionaire and the principles inspiring the Concession.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 130.\n\n***(b) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n196.\n\nAzurix claims that the Province issued Circular 52(A) in an attempt to attract the highest bids from prospective investors. Azurix maintains that Circular 52(A) assured bidders that the Canon would be considered an investment fully amortizable through tariffs.133 In this respect, Azurix refers to LECG's expert report: in which it is stated:\n\n\"Although the Province did not issue ex-ante details on regulatory methodology and accounting principles for the tariff reviews, it issued Circular 52(A). In this Circular, the Province indicates very clearly that the initial payment will be treated as an investment. As such, bidders, including Azurix Corp. must have properly assumed that, in the context of a price-cap regime, the canon would be included in the asset base for tariff review purposes, after accounting for its amortization.  \n This expectation was based on international and Argentine regulatory experience.\"134\n\nMemorial, p. 178.\n\nIbid., p.125.\n\n197.\n\nArgentina contests the interpretation given by Azurix to Circular 52(A). In its Counter-Memorial, Argentina explains that the fee paid for the Concession is the price to run a monopoly. Argentina considers that this issue was not \"a real conflict between ABA and the Province as Law No. 11,820 and the Contract would have never allowed such transfer. The issue was introduced within the framework of negotiations with the Province, in a desperate attempt by Azurix to alter the obligations assumed and the Contract\".135 Argentina draws attention to Article 12.3.1 of the Concession which provides that the tariffs shall be in force during the term of the Concession and their review may only occur based on events after the takeover of the Concession (Article 12.3.4, 5 and 6 of the Contract and Section 23-II of the Law).\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 854.\n\n198.\n\nArgentina refers to the expert report of Mr. Chama, one of Argentina's experts, who explains that the bidding process for the Concession sought to select \"the economic player that is willing to pay the highest price, usually called 'fee', for the right to exercise the monopoly; and the selection consists simply of determining who is willing to pay the highest price as from a certain rate level, with a rate adjustment system primarily based on service conditions established in the bidding documents and in the regulatory framework governing the service.\"136\n\nIbid., para. 861.\n\n199.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the offer of Azurix was opportunistic in the sense that the purpose was the immediate renegotiation of the Concession Agreement to recover the profits renounced in the competitive bidding process. Mr. Chama states that \"it could never be argued that the concession fee can be defined as a component of the cost of service and become a factor determining the rates or prices of the service itself\".137 Argentina wonders what would be the point of competing in a bidding process if the concession fee would be subsequently transferred to users.138 Argentina further argues that the transfer of the concession fee to the tariffs would result in \"the absurdity of having different tariffs in different areas depending on the concession fee offered by the winning bidder.\"139\n\nIbid., para. 864.\n\nIbid., para. 867.\n\nIbid., para. 868.\n\n200.\n\nArgentina points out that, in the letter of August 29, 2001, the Minister of Public Works of the Province stated that Azurix's representative, after several months of negotiations, requested \"an additional condition: to study the mechanisms to adjust the Tariff Regime, aiming at recouping the concession fee paid for taking over the Concession.\"140 The Minister adds: \"under the Bidding Conditions, payment of the concession fee corresponded to the price that you bid for the concession, assuming the risk that you may not recoup it, considering that if the [C]oncession guaranteed the reimbursement of the price paid plus a rate of return thereon, the business started by Azurix would not be a risky one, as it is stated in Article 12.3.1 of the Concession Contract.\"141\n\nIbid., para. 875.\n\nIbid.\n\n201.\n\nAs part of Argentina's arguments on this issue, Argentina brings to the attention of the Tribunal certain alleged irregularities regarding Circulars 51(B) and 52(A) and Section 12.1.1 of the Contract. According to Argentina, these two circulars were the last circulars issued by the Privatization Committee before bidders presented their economic offer.142 Circular 51(B) reduced the volume of water that the Concessionaire was to deliver annually free of charge established only the week before, on May 5. The reduction for ABA exceeded 57%. In contrast, the water volumes fell only by 1.48% in Region B, the only Region not awarded to ABA.143\n\nIbid., para.878\n\nIbid., paras. 878-881.\n\n202.\n\nAs regards Article 12.1.1 of the Contract, Argentina draws the attention of the Tribunal to the statement of Azurix in the Memorial whereby the Province, in need of money to balance the budget in 1999, wanted to maximize the Canon and \"To this end, it issued Circular 52(A), saying that the Canon would be recognized as an amortizable investment, and thus, included in the tariff rate base. The Province confirmed this by adding Article 12.1.1 to the Contract. \"144 Argentina observes that this section of Article 12 was not in the model contract which was part of the bidding documents and did not establish that the concession fee could be transferred through tariffs. The original Article 12 simply stated a general principle to be taken into account in the determination of the tariff regime. Azurix's interpretation would make this section contrary to law. The Concession Agreement could not be substantially altered after the bidding process. Amendments to the Concession Agreement were done through letters of amendment, no such letter was used in this case and it might have also been absent in another change also introduced after the award of the contract, i.e. the introduction of a 6-month period of grace for penalties on account of any infringements.145\n\nIbid., para. 882. Emphasis added by the Respondent.\n\nIbid., paras. 898-899.\n\n203.\n\nArgentina alleges that the Tribunal took Article 12.1.1 of the Concession Agreement into account as a decisive factor in its decision on jurisdiction in disregard of the possible irregularities that affect this section which \"could have led the tribunal to error.\"146 Argentina informs that its courts will solve the issues dealing with the inclusion of Article 12.1.1 and considers that, \"In any case, the impact on the progress of Azurix's claim before this Tribunal is evident, as well as the fact that the Tribunal is not competent to decide on the facts described.\"147\n\nIbid., para. 900.\n\nIbid., para. 902.\n\n204.\n\nAzurix contests that the Canon is only an access fee for the Concession. Circular 52(A) explained that the Canon constitutes an investment to be amortized. According to Azurix, utility investors understand that, when access to other markets is prohibited, canon payments are considered investments to be recovered through regulated tariffs. This is standard regulatory practice in Argentina and the Province. Azurix refers to an internal MOSP report on the MOU process in which Mr. S\u00edcaro states: \"the proposed scheme accounts for the fact that there is a canon to be amortized by the expiration of the Concession term\".148 This is in contrast with the statements made by him before the Tribunal as a witness. According to Azurix, the Province simply lacked the political will to allow its recovery in accordance with representations made by the Privatization Commission, the Concession Agreement and Circular 52(A).149\n\nReply, 251.\n\nIbid., para. 252.\n\n205.\n\nAzurix dismisses the concept of \"unbounded risk\" claimed by Argentina. According to Azurix and relying on LECG rebuttal: \"The 'unbounded risk' concept introduced by Mr. Chama, is deadly off the mark. Were concessions based on the 'unbounded risk' concept, no private investor will ever pay anything for the concession.\"150\n\nIbid., para. 255.\n\n206.\n\nAzurix also dismisses the unconstitutionality alleged by Argentina if similarly situated customers would pay different prices for public services. This is actually a fact in the Province and Argentina.151\n\nIbid., paras. 256-257.\n\n207.\n\nAzurix also rebuts the notion that Circular 52(A) is only an accounting clarification and points out that Argentina fails to explain how this clarification was to be applied or its practical meaning. Furthermore, argues Azurix, Argentina's allegations in respect of the Canon are not consistent with the facts and recognized utility practice. Azurix points out that in the case of another Argentine public utility, Transener, specific provisions like Article 7.8 and Circular 52(A) were not deemed necessary to include the Canon in the tariff rate base.152\n\nIbid., paras. 258-263.\n\n208.\n\nAzurix affirms that it was the behavior of the Province that was opportunistic. The additional capital contributions made by Azurix and exceeding US$106 million do not indicate behavior of an opportunistic investor seeking additional advantages through a post-bid negotiation. Azurix observes that if the Province, advised by Mr. Chama himself during the bidding process judged Azurix's bid opportunistic or reckless could have rejected the bid and did nothing of the sort.153 On this point, Azurix concludes that, 'in light of the guarantees offered by the Regulatory Framework, the Concession Agreement and Circular 52(A), the Province should have recognized the implications of accepting Azurix bid. If the Province chose to ignore long-term effects for the benefit of short-term political interests, then it did so under the legal obligation to honor commitments made.\"154\n\nIbid., paras. 266-267.\n\nIbid., para. 268.\n\n209.\n\nAzurix also contests the supposed irregularities of Circular 52(A) and Article 12.1.1. As Argentina itself admits, this Article merely reiterates what is already contemplated in the Regulatory Framework and the Concession Agreement: \"It is Azurix's view that Article 12.1.1 is consistent with Article 28-II(d) of Law 11,820, Article 7.8 of the Concession Agreement and Circular 52(A). They all fit together into a harmonious and systematic whole. Therefore any suggestions that this introduction substantially changed the scope of the Concession Agreement is wrong. It merely clarified it.\"155 According to Azurix, by its actions, the Province repudiated Circular 52(A).\n\nIbid., para. 272.\n\n210.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, Argentina refers to statements made by a World Bank expert, Mr. Guasch, to support the allegation of opportunistic behavior of Azurix. According to Mr. Guasch,\n\n\"\u2026operators should be held accountable to their bids, and if petitions for renegotiation are turned down, operators ought to feel free to abandon the projects, if they choose to do so (with the corresponding penalties). The appropriate behavior for the government is to uphold the sanctity of the bid and not concede to opportunistic request for renegotiation and, in such cases, allow concessions to fail. Such outcomes would reduce the incidence of renegotiation. That is a key issue in private concessions of infrastructure services \u2013yet one that is often resolved in favor of operators. Thus aggressive bidding and the high incidence of renegotiation should not be surprising.\"156\n\nRejoinder, p. 1.\n\n211.\n\nAnd again more specifically on the issue of valuation of concession assets:\n\n\"What clearly should not be used for the value of the concession in the capital base \u2013from which the operator is allowed to earn a fair rate of return- is the value paid at the bidding stage, regardless of depreciation method. Doing that would take away the efficiency-competitive angle of the auction, by allowing a rate of return on whatever price was paid for the concession.\"157\n\nIbid., para. 868.\n\n212.\n\nArgentina considers reasonable that the bidders take into account the return on the investment in order to calculate the concession fee, but it is illogical and unreasonable that the fee be passed through to rates. While every bidder may expect to make reasonable profits above the concession fee, this is not an acquired right.158\n\nIbid., paras. 870-871.\n\n213.\n\nArgentina denies Azurix's allegation that in the natural gas and electricity sectors the amounts paid as concession fees had been taken into account to determine applicable rates.159 Furthermore, Argentina considers that the concession fees in these sectors may reflect accurately the value of assets transferred because there are no cross-subsidies or an obligation to expand the grid.160 Then Argentina refers to the specific example of Transener, an electricity distribution company. In the context of a five-year rate review, Transener argued that the price paid for the concession should be used to determine the asset value for rate-setting purposes. The regulatory agency for the power sector did not accept the argument. In fact, NERA, an expert consulting company in the instant case, advised the regulator that, if the price paid at the time of the privatization:\n\n\"constituted the basis of the calculation, then, any amount paid should be recovered through rates (circularity of rates)\" and, \"if the rates can be calculated on the basis of the value of the company at the time of privatization or, if the rate of return of the company is guaranteed on the bid price, there is nothing to prevent an economic agent from offering a large amount if the implicit regulatory rate of return is higher than its own weighted capital cost.\"161\n\nIbid., paras. 877-878.\n\nIbid., para. 881.\n\nIbid., paras. 889-890.\n\n214.\n\nArgentina refers also to NERA's advice to defend the concepts of regulatory and accounting amortization advanced in the Counter-Memorial. According to NERA:\n\n\"Regulatory amortization is the annual percentage of the asset base that is deducted from the regulatory book value in accordance with the standards established by the regulator. Accounting amortization is the percentage of the asset base that may be written off the accounting books every year in accordance with the standards set by the tax authority and the professional council of economic sciences. These are two different concepts. While regulatory amortization serves the purpose of setting rates, accounting amortization is used to calculate taxes and determine the accounting book value.\"162\n\nAccording to Argentina, ENRE, the regulator, took into account these observations.\n\nIbid., para. 261.\n\n215.\n\nArgentina considers Article 7.8 of the Contract to be very clear. It consists of three elements: the amortization of assets in service acquired or built by the Concessionaire and the improvements made thereon by the Concessionaire.163 As regards Article 1.8, Argentina considers that this Article is also clear in showing that the concession fee was not an investment but the price paid to be awarded an area. Argentina refers to Mr. Chama's expert advice and affirms that, for the Concessionaire to earn a reasonable return, Azurix's assessment underlying its Offer would have to have been reasonable and the fee compatible with the financial equilibrium of the Concession. The Concession fee presupposed an appropriate economic offer, otherwise the Concessionaire would offset its deficits derived from ordinary business risks, a compensation expressly prohibited in the Concession Agreement.164\n\nIbid., para. 911.\n\nIbid., para. 917.\n\n216.\n\nArgentina points out that, as there was no rule permitting it, there was no submission by ABA to the ORAB requesting the transfer of the concession fee paid onto rates or the increase in rates to cover a part of the concession fee. Argentina alleges that the dispute only arose at the end of the negotiations with the Province in search of an overhaul of the rate system or an excuse to provide grounds for termination.165 The circulars issued by the Privatization Commission could only introduce clarifications of or amendments to the Terms of Reference provided they were not substantial in nature. If Circular 52(A) would be interpreted as Azurix suggests, it would have introduced a substantial amendment to the rate system contemplated in the Contract. Professor Comadira in his expert opinion states that, in that case, \"it would be unreasonable and incompatible with the rest of the provisions of the terms of reference.'\"166 According to the same expert, the rate system could only be modified after the third year of the Concession (Article 30-II(c)), the rates167 and prices should have been effective during the term of the Concession (Article 12.3.1), and the values and prices could only be modified by virtue of the procedures and for the reasons disclosed in Article 12.3.2. Therefore, ABA's interpretation of Circular 52(A), \"apart from being inconsistent with the harmonic and systematic interpretation of all the clauses of the Terms of Reference, which it may only clarify but never modify substantially under penalty of becoming an absolute nullity, disregards clear legal regulations applicable to the Concession Contract.\"168 Professor Comadira even affirms that:\n\n\"A modification of the contracting conditions as the one provided for in the Circular under analysis should have necessarily meant a new call for bids to enable the possible participation of any potential bidders that would have been self excluded under the original conditions. Since that was not the case, the equality guarantee has been clearly violated, thus corrupting the whole procedure.\"169\n\nIbid., para. 921.\n\nExpert Opinion of Professor Comadira (Comadira), p. 41, quoted in the Rejoinder, para. 928.\n\nIt should be pointed out that Article 12.3.1 does not refer to \"rates\" but to \"tariff values.\"\n\nComadira, p. 40, quoted in the Rejoinder, para. 930.\n\nIbid., p. 37, quoted in the Rejoinder, para. 933.\n\n217.\n\nIn addition, Professor Comadira explains that the addition of Article 12.1.1 and its interpretation by Azurix would mean that the essential principle of equality in a bidding process would have been violated, this being \"a fundamental principle of the general law and administrative law.\" He concludes by inviting the Tribunal to rule this article as manifestly void of absolute and incurable nullity in response to \"an ethical or juristic requirement.\"170\n\nIbid. p. 44, quoted in the Rejoinder, para. 940.\n\n218.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the studies leading to the presentation of the offer could not have taken into \"account an interpretation that would have distorted the rate system contemplated in the contract, on the grounds of a nonexistent provision.\" Azurix could not have entertained any expectations in this respect.171\n\nRejoinder, paras. 942-943.\n\n***(c) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n219.\n\nIt will be useful to quote first in full the relevant legislative and contractual provisions:\n\nArticle 28 of the Law:\n\n\"Prices and tariffs will tend to reflect the economic cost of providing potable water and sewer services, including the Concessionaire's margin of profit for and the resulting basic infrastructure costs of the POES.\"\n\nConcession Agreement:\n\nArticle 12.1.1:\n\n\"Determination of the tariff level required under Article 28-II of Law No. 11,820, shall be based on the general principle under which tariff values shall cover the operating, maintenance and amortization costs of the services and allow for a reasonable rate of return on the amounts invested by Concessionaire within an efficient operation and management environment, as well as full achievement of the agreed-upon service expansion and quality goals.\"\n\nArticle 7.8:\n\n\"The Service-related assets acquired or built by the Concessionaire and belonging to it as well as all improvements made thereon shall be capitalized by accounting procedures and shall be depreciated integrally over the term of the Concession or over their Useful Lives, whichever term is shorter; the provisions of the fourth paragraph hereof notwithstanding.\n\nThe investments the Concessionaire makes in the assets received by/from the Province upon Take Over shall be considered as acquisition and/or maintenance costs of the Concession in accordance with provisions of clause 1.8 and shall be amortized over the term of the Concession.\"\n\nArticle 1.8:\n\n\"The grant of the Concession shall be in consideration of payment of an initial canon equal to \u2026 by the Concessionaire. Said amount has been paid up by the Concessionaire to the Province upon the signing of the Agreement, and it is equivalent to the amount offered by the Awardee [sic] under the Bidding Process, to be credited as the price for the Concession Area. However, the Concessionaire does hereby undertake to make all necessary investments to execute the POES and to secure the correct provision of Service under the Agreement, the description of which is detailed in Annex F hereto, the tariffs increments being subject to the guidelines stated in Annex \u00d1 being subject to compliance with said obligations.\"\n\nCircular 52(A):\n\n\"It is clarified that the initial royalty which is referred to in Section 1.8 of the Concession Contract constitutes an amortizable investment during the concession period (article 7.8 correlative and concordant of the Concession Contract).\"\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal will turn first to the relationship of Circular 52(A) to Article 1.8, second to the meaning of the additional provision 12.1.1 of the Concession Agreement, third to the rationale of the Concession, and fourth to asset depreciation in the asset regime of the Concession Agreement (Article 7.8).\n\n***(i) Circular 52(A): The Canon as an Investment***\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n221.\n\nThe parties have discussed the meaning of the term \"canon\" and whether the Canon is an investment. Article 1.8 of the Contract refers to the Canon as \"the consideration\" for the granting of the Concession and, in the next sentence, as \"the price for the Concession Area.\" The following sentence deals with the undertaking related to the POES investments. It starts with the word \"however\" as a counterpoint to the consideration paid by the Canon, as if to emphasize that the payment of the Canon were not the only contribution to be made by the Concessionaire. This reading of Article 1.8 is reinforced if compared with the terms of Article 28 of the Law. Article 28 sets forth the general principle that: \"the prices and tariff will tend to reflect the economic cost of the provision of the services of water supply and sewer services\", and continues by saying: \"including a profit margin and the cost arising from the POES related to basic infrastructure.\" The economic cost of a service would include, by definition, all costs related to the provision of the service. The specific reference to investments arising out of the POES would seem to be a clarification rather than an exclusion of other investment costs. In case there was any doubt about its meaning at the time of the bidding for the Concession, the Privatization Commission issued Circular 52(A) which clearly states that \"the initial canon\u2026constitutes an investment.\" The Tribunal has no reason to doubt the interpretation given by the Privatization Commission. It had the power to issue clarifications of the Bidding Terms and Conditions and all bidders would have been aware of the clarification when they submitted the bid as in the case of any other circular issued by the Privatization Commission. Argentina had argued that Circular 52(A) was issued close to the deadline for the submission of bids and was the last circular issued by the Commission. The evidence provided to the Tribunal shows that Circular 52(A) was not the last circular to be issued by the Commission and that other significant circulars were issued after the date of Circular 52(A). The issue is not so much whether the Canon is an investment but whether being an investment makes it a recoverable investment beyond the given tariff at the time of bidding and as adjusted through the extraordinary reviews.\n\n***(ii) The Addition of Article 12.1.1.***\n------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nIn arguing that Article 12.1.1 of the Concession Agreement is not extraneous to the Concession regime, the Claimant states that: \"it is Azurix's view that Article 12.1.1 is consistent with Article 28-II(d) of Law 11,820, Article 7.8 of the Concession Agreement and Circular 52(A). They all fit together into a harmonious and systematic whole. Therefore, suggestions that this introduction substantially changed the scope of the Concession Agreement are wrong. It merely clarified it.\"172 In support of this statement, the Claimant refers to the expert opinion of Professor Fern\u00e1ndez who affirms:\n\n\"Section 12.1.1 of the Contract is not a word-by-word reproduction of the section with the same number of the sample agreement attached to the Bidding Terms and Conditions; however, under no means does it imply a modification to the agreed-upon terms since it merely incorporates into the contract the provisions of Section 28(ii) of Law 11,820 and the statement made at the time by means of Circular 52(A), acknowledging that the Canon was an 'investment to be amortized throughout the term of the concession.'\"173\n\nReply, para. 272.\n\nLegal Opinion of Professor Fern\u00e1ndez, para. 56, Reply, Annex 1, para. 271.\n\n223.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, Argentina considered that Article 12.1.1 established a general principle already taken into account in Annex \u00d1 of the Concession Agreement in order to determine the tariff regime. The resulting rate for the duration of the Concession was \"fair and reasonable and allowed a reasonable return.\"174 For Argentina, it was impossible to build Azurix's interpretation into the terms of Circular 52(A) and Article 12.1.1 of the Concession Agreement without amending substantially the terms of the agreement against the provisions of the Law, which did not permit the passing through of the Canon to the rates.\n\nReply, para. 887.\n\n224.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, Argentina argued differently and, instead of admitting that Article 12.1.1 established a general principle, it stated that the insertion of Article 12.1.1 is not being supported by any legal provision and that this article could not have been part of the considerations present when Azurix submitted its bid for the Concession.175\n\nIbid., para. 941.\n\n225.\n\nArticle 12.1.1 provides that the tariff level required under article 28-II shall be based on the general principle that the tariff values cover the operation, maintenance and amortization costs of the service and permit a reasonable return on the investments of the Concessionaire in the context of an efficient administration and operation and exact fulfillment of the agreed quality and expansion objectives of service. While article 12.1.1 refers to article 28-II of the Law, it introduces a notion, \"return on assets\", not present in this article 28, and, conversely, there is no reference to the \"profit margin\" of Article 28-II in Article 12.1.1. Taking a long term view of the Concession, profit margins and rates of return may come to the same result, but they are different concepts and the concession regime does not contemplate a regime based on rates of return as explained by the Claimant's own experts and to which we will now turn.\n\n***(iii) Rationale of the Concession***\n---------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nAt the time of bidding, the bidders knew the tariff level and that this level could not be changed except as provided in the model contract. These provisions are usual in concession tariff regimes known as price cap regulatory regimes. Both parties agree that the tariff regime under the Concession Agreement followed the price cap model.176 However, the parties' experts draw different implications for purposes of determining whether the Canon was part of the tariff review. The expert report of LECG submitted by the Claimant explains this regime and affirms that:\n\n\"The strong incentives for greater efficiency are probably the major innovation of the price cap regulatory regimes, and reflect an essential benefit of the system. A second benefit\u2026is the reduction in regulatory costs as compared to the **traditional rate of return regulation**, which required continuous supervision of investments and costs, thus increasing regulatory costs.\"177\n\nArgentina explains in its Counter-Memorial that there are different ways to regulate utilities, \"One is to adjust tariffs based on the actual costs of the service provider and the other way is to fix in advance a fair and reasonable tariff capable of covering the costs of an efficient operator and yielding a reasonable profit. In the latter case, to earn a reasonable profit, the service provider must be efficient.\" (para. 959). According to Argentina, the privatizations during the nineties followed generally the second model (Counter-Memorial, para. 960).\n\nExhibit 19A to Memorial, p. 32. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n227.\n\nThis report quotes from a World Bank study:\n\n\"For a concessionaire that has paid a transfer to government to operate a business at a predetermined set of prices, these issues [asset valuation and depreciation] could be important. Regulatory disputes could emerge relating to what the concessionaire actually bought with that transfer \u2013 **a stream of future earnings or a return on the preexisting and future asset base** ? Issues relating to the depreciation profile of both old and new assets therefore assume particular importance and should be signaled by the government during the bidding process.\n\n[\u2026] If the criterion is the largest lump sum offered to run a franchise, however, the outgoing concessionaire could receive the highest bid, **since this bid reflects the value of the assets as they currently exist**. However, this value is based on the future stream of earnings, which is determined by the price set by the regulator throughout the new franchise. If the regulator unreasonably ratchets down prices for the period of the new concession, this effectively expropriates the value of the assets built in the previous concession. Generally, therefore, **new** **investment** by the concessionaire needs to be transparently treated by the regulator at each review, as part of the process of rolling forward the asset base and charging depreciation on it.\"178\n\nIbid., pp. 59-60. Emphasis added by the Tribunal.\n\n228.\n\nSomehow contradictorily, the LECG report argues for linking the Canon to the tariff review in a price cap regime when the quoted literature explains that in lump sum situations the value of the assets has been calculated by the bidder on the basis of the stream of estimated earnings within the *set level of tariffs* and the periodic adjustments permitted by the Concession Agreement.\n\n229.\n\nLECG analyzes what would be the evolution of tariffs if the Canon were not included in the tariff base,\n\n\"At the first ordinary rate review the regulator, following standard regulatory practice as well as the regulatory framework and the Concession Contract, would consider the expected investment and operating costs, add the amortization of capital additions for the previous four years, and derive a tariff rate that would provide a normal rate of return only on the additions to the capital following the privatization. The result would be a price that would fall substantially below the long run marginal cost of the system. This is because such rates would remunerate only the capital added since privatization but not the capital already in place when the company started operations. Since, to be able to provide the service efficiently and effectively, both kinds of assets (i.e., that in place prior to privatization and the additional post-privatization) are needed, rates have to remunerate both of them.\"179\n\nLECG \"An Economic Assessment of Argentina's Counter-Memorial and of Mr. Chama's Report\", Exhibit 4 to the Reply, p. 29.\n\n230.\n\nLECG concludes,\n\n\"Adding the canon to the tariff base provides the right incentives for both consumption and investment. Consumers will be facing the long run cost of providing the system and investors will have incentives to invest.\"180\n\nIbid., p. 30.\n\n231.\n\nIn its reasoning, LECG ignores the current tariff level at the time that the Concession was granted. That tariff level was already in effect and future adjustments were meant precisely to remunerate the capital added since privatization. LECG's argument assumes that the current tariff would not be taken into account in the calculation of the adjustment, while the Concession Agreement considers it the base from which to start the review. The existing tariff provides the remuneration for the capital invested in the Concession *ab initio.*\n\n232.\n\nParadoxically, LECG itself seems to agree with this conclusion. When discussing the issue of the elimination of monopolistic rents through a competitive bidding process, the report adds a footnote stating that:\n\n\"Observe that although the investor bids the expected net present value of future cash flows, the investor makes money on the investment. Indeed, when discounting future cash flows, the investor uses a discount rate. This discount rate is the rate of return the investor gets on the initial investment (the canon) over the life of the concession.\"181\n\nIbid., p. 31, footnote 53.\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal will now analyze asset depreciation in the asset regime of the Concession Agreement.\n\n***(iv) Article 7.8***\n----------------------\n\n234.\n\nArticle 7.8 on depreciation (\"amortizaci\u00f3n\") is part of Article VII of the Concession Agreement on \"Assets\" (\"R\u00e9gimen de Bienes\"). The first paragraph of this article provides for the capitalization and depreciation of assets over the term of the Concession or their useful lives whichever is shorter, with an exception which we do not need to refer to for purposes of this analysis. The assets to be capitalized and depreciated are those assets, and improvements on them, which are service-related, have been acquired or built by the Concessionaire and belong to the Concessionaire. They need to meet these three conditions. The term \"belonging\" is a translation of \"que sean de su titularidad.\" They need to be assets to which the Concessionaire has legal title. Article 7.2 on \"Title\" distinguishes between the possession of assets received by the Concessionaire from the Province and assets and movable assets and real property acquired or constructed during the term of the Concession which shall be owned by the Concessionaire. Title to these assets shall be recorded in the Real Property Registry and in the respective registries of movable assets. This is not the case of assets received from the Province.\n\n235.\n\nThe distinction becomes clearer when Article 7.2 and 7.8 are read together with Article 7.6 on disposition of assets. In the case of disposition of assets \"owned by the Province \u2026 the Concessionaire shall act as the Province's agent.\" This distinction then carries over to the second paragraph of Article 7.8 which establishes that, \"The investments made by the Concessionaire in the assets received by [sic] [\"de\" in Spanish, \"from\" would be the correct translation] the Province upon Take Over shall be considered as acquisition of and/or upkeep costs of the Concession in accordance with provisions of clause 1.8 and shall be depreciated over the term of the Concession.\" This paragraph limits the definition of investments to those made in the properties received from the Province without including the properties themselves.\n\n236.\n\nThe distinction between assets received and those acquired or improvements on the assets received carries over to the requirement for approval of acquisition and disposal of assets and how administrative silence to a request for acquisition or disposal of assets needs to be interpreted. In the case of movable assets owned by the Province, and those owned, whether movable or not, by the Claimant, silence to a request for their disposal shall be understood as approval (Article 7.6.2). On the other hand, silence by the ORAB in the case of non-movable assets registered in the name of the Province shall be understood as rejection of the request (Article 7.6.1).\n\n237.\n\nThe distinction is particularly relevant when it comes to the termination of the Concession. In the case of termination due to acts of God or *force majeure* (Article 14.2.1), the Province is required to pay the non-amortized value of investments and Service-related assets acquired or built by the Concessionaire in accordance with Article 7.8. Under the terms of this article, the assets received from the Province are not acquired assets. The Concessionaire did not become the owner of the assets transferred by the Province, nor did it ever have registered title to them.\n\n238.\n\nThe Claimant has argued that the existing assets at the time of the transfer and those acquired later form a unit. The argument is based on Articles 42-II and 43-II of the Law. Article 42-II provides that: \"The assets that are covered by this article and which must be included in the Concession Contract are the assets the Concessionaire receives by virtue of the Contract. Also included are assets that the Concessionaire acquires or builds in order to fulfill its obligations under the Concession Contract.\" Article 43-II reads as follows: \"Assets that are transferred to the Concessionaire are part of a group known as the appropriated unit [\u2018unidad de afectaci\u00f3n' in Spanish].\"\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that the indivisibility of the unit has to be considered in the light of the other provisions on assets in the Concession Agreement and it cannot override the distinctions made between them regarding the ownership of assets, and their administration and disposal.\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes after this analysis of the relevant provisions of the Law and the Concession Agreement that a harmonious interpretation of these provisions does not permit to consider the Canon as if it would be an investment not included in the existing tariff at the time of the transfer. The Tribunal has no doubt that the Canon is an investment, but, for purposes of tariff setting and amortization, the investor, in preparing the bid for the Concession, had to make a calculation of the value of the earnings stream of the Concession, and the price paid for the Concession was the result of this calculation. It is interesting to note, in that regard, that the Claimant seems to be the only bidder to have interpreted Circular 52(A) as it did, the other bidders presenting canons with values at least ten times lower than that submitted by the Claimant.\n\n241.\n\nWhile the principle of amortization may have applied to the initial Canon as a matter of principle, whether it was amortized or not during the duration of the Concession would depend on whether the Concessionaire had estimated correctly the worth of the future earnings of the Concession based on the initial tariff and the discount rate to be applied to this estimate of future earnings. The discount rate used by the Claimant in the preparation of the bid was the rate of return on the Canon as an \"investment\". This seems to be inherent to a price cap concession regime and the terms of the Concession Agreement.\n\n242.\n\nTo conclude the consideration of the issue of Canon recovery, the Tribunal refers to the statement made by Argentina that the Tribunal may have erred by disregarding the irregularities of Article 12.1.1 in affirming its jurisdiction. According to Argentina, the Tribunal took this Article as a decisive factor in its decision. The Respondent refers specifically to paragraph 62 of the decision on jurisdiction, which reads as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal finds difficulty in following the Respondent's reasoning on the basis of the definition of investment in Article I.1(a) of the BIT. First, a concession contract, such as that entered by ABA with the Province, qualifies as an investment for purposes of the BIT given the wide meaning conferred upon this term in the BIT that includes \"any right conferred by law or contract.\" The Concession Agreement itself refers repeatedly to investments. For instance, in the context of the determination of the tariff level, the Concession Agreement refers to \"a reasonable return on the amounts *invested* by the Concessionaire,\" [Article 12.1.1] and \"the Concessionaire does hereby undertake to make all necessary *investments* to execute\u2026 [Article 7.8]\"\n\n243.\n\nIn that paragraph, the Tribunal refers to Article 12.1.1 as an example of references to investments for purposes of the definition of this term under the BIT. The reasoning of the Tribunal would be the same without this example, which is not the only example in the paragraph. The other example, Article 7.8, has not been questioned by the Respondent. It should be apparent from the preceding discussion that what is an investment under the BIT and what is a recoverable investment under the Concession Agreement are different matters, and that whether an investment is or is not recoverable may be irrelevant for purposes of it being considered an investment under the BIT.\n\n**8. Termination**\n------------------\n\n***(a) Introduction***\n----------------------\n\n244.\n\nAs has already been noted, ABA requested the Province to cure its breaches of the Concession Agreement on July 18, 2001. The Province replied on August 29, 2001 denying any wrongdoing; in particular, the letter denied the right of the Concessionaire to recover its investment, including the initial Canon. On October 5, 2001, ABA terminated the Concession Agreement. On November 1, 2001, the Province issued an Executive Order rejecting the termination of the Concession Agreement and ordering ABA to cease and desist from claiming that it had terminated the Concession Agreement, and to refrain from engaging in conduct that would disturb the provision of the service.\n\n245.\n\nABA filed for bankruptcy reorganization proceedings on February 26, 2002. On March 7, 2002, the Province deemed that ABA had abandoned the service. On March 12, 2002, the Province terminated the Concession Agreement alleging ABA's fault: non-fulfillment of service expansion and quality goals, fines imposed on ABA, difficulties of ABA in obtaining chemical supplies in February 2002 and paying for electric power, Enron's bankruptcy and service abandonment. On March 15, 2002, ABA delivered the service to the Province.\n\n***(b) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThe Claimant has asserted that Article 48-II of the Law expressly delegated the definition of the right to terminate the Concession to the Concession Agreement, and that Article 14.1.4 of the Concession Agreement did not require the intervention of any authority to be terminated. On the other hand, Article 14.4.4 provides for court intervention for purposes of the reception of the service. Thus, concludes the Claimant, when the Province had considered it necessary to include reference to court intervention, it did so.182\n\nReply, para. 520.\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimant also addresses the need for the competent authorities to intervene in case of termination of a concession required by Article 49-II of the Law. According to the Claimant, this Article has to be construed appropriately and can \"only be interpreted as appointing the competent governmental authorities for the purposes of declaring termination of the Concession Agreement upon the occurrence of events allowing the grantor its right of termination [\u2026] It cannot be construed as a reference to termination when it is not declared by 'an authority'\".183\n\nIbid., para. 517.\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimant also draws the attention of the Tribunal to the different treatment of termination on account of the grantor's fault in the case of the Concession Agreement as compared to other concession agreements previously entered into by the Province and in which intervention of the courts is required to declare the agreement terminated in the event of resistance on the part of the Province. The Claimant draws the conclusion that these previous agreements were taken into account by provincial officials in drafting the Concession Agreement and departed from them, *inter alia*, in respect of the Concessionaire\u2018s right to terminate the Concession Agreement.184\n\nIbid., para. 525.\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that the many serious breaches of the Concession Agreement caused an irreversible imbalance of the economics of the Concession and that, in these circumstances, the demand by the Government that ABA continue to provide the service and complying with the expansion goals constituted overt and unwarranted abuse of its rights.185 On the basis of Professor Fern\u00e1ndez's legal opinion, the Claimant affirms that, if it were not possible for the Concessionaire to terminate the Concession Agreement unilaterally without further intervention of the Province the contractual provision would lack any practical application; because the final settlement of this matter would be entirely left to the discretion of the Government, ignoring what the law specifically intended to avoid.186 The same expert considers that:\n\n\"whenever the Law or the agreement recognizes in contractors the right to terminate said agreement, the general rule that sets forth that the termination of the agreement always requires a formal pronouncement by the Government must be replaced by the maxim *exceptio non adimpleti contractus*, as the only possible way of avoiding an abuse by the Government under this rule, disregarding the contents of its provisions and forcing the contractor into a ruinous situation.\"187\n\nIbid., para. 503.\n\nIbid., para. 528.\n\nIbid., para. 528, quote from Professor Fern\u00e1ndez's legal opinion, Reply, Annex 1, para.160.\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimant adduces extensive doctrinal opinion and Argentine and European administrative case law to defend the applicability of the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* to the termination of the Concession Agreement.188 The Claimant also refers to *Aucoven* where the arbitral tribunal, when faced with a similar situation found that, if the parties had intended to subject the termination of the concession agreement to a ruling by a judicial body, they would have expressly referred to such requirement in the clause in question.189 The Claimant further argues that, if Article 14.1.4 is ambiguous, then it should be construed against its drafter.190\n\nReply, paras. 541-555.\n\nIbid., para. 557.\n\nIbid., paras. 558-559.\n\n251.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Province fabricated a case against Azurix to hide its own breaches while the Concessionaire continued to provide the service. The Concessionaire informed the Province on the day of the termination that it would continue to provide service for 90 days. In fact, it provided it for more than five months, which proves that the Concessionaire did not abandon the Concession.191\n\nIbid., para. 571 and ff.\n\n252.\n\nThe Claimant draws the attention of the Tribunal to the fact that the Respondent continued to take measures that have aggravated the situation notwithstanding the Tribunal's order to refrain from doing so. In particular, the Province indicated that it would not approve ABA's proposal to creditors, collected payments of ABA's customers, and cashed ABA's and OBA's performance bonds.192\n\nIbid., para. 580 and ff.\n\n253.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Province had the exclusive power to terminate the Concession, that the Concessionaire had to request termination from the Province and, if the Province denied it, then the Concessionaire could file an action in the local courts to seek a judgment declaring contractual termination. In fact, ABA lodged an appeal against the Province's termination before the Argentine Courts. According to Argentina's expert, Dr. Solomoni, Article 14.1.4 does not authorize the Concessionaire to declare the Concession Agreement terminated but it regulates the Province's prerogative to terminate the Concession Agreement even in the event of non-compliance by the Province. The Respondent alleges that the defense of the Claimant based on the *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* is not applicable here because it was never used by ABA when it defended its action. ABA always maintained that it had the right to terminate the Concession Agreement unilaterally.193\n\nRejoinder, paras. 809-917.\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent also raises the issue of a conflict between the BIT and human rights treaties that protect consumers' rights. According to Argentina's expert, a conflict between a BIT and human rights treaties must be resolved in favor of human rights because the consumers' public interest must prevail over the private interest of service provider.194 On this point, the Claimant argues that the user's rights were duly protected by the provisions made in the Concession Agreement and the Province fails to prove how said rights were affected by the termination.195\n\nDr. Solomoni's expert opinion, pp. 27-28.\n\nReply, para. 565.\n\n***(c) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n255.\n\nArticle 14.1.4 \u2013 Termination due to Fault of the Granting Authority - reads as follows in the translation furnished by the Claimant:196\n\n\"The Concessionaire may claim termination of the Agreement based on the Concession Grantor's fault where a rule, act, fact or omission by the Concession Grantor results in a substantial noncompliance with the obligations undertaken by the Concession Grantor under the Agreement reasonably impairing its performance.\n\nIn such event, within thirty (30) days from knowledge or occurrence of said event, the Concessionaire shall demand the Concession Grantor to cease such noncompliance, and grant a reasonable term of at least thirty (30) days. In the event that Grantor fails to observe its obligations, the Agreement shall terminate.\"\n\nMemorial, p. 128, footnote 528.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal notes first that the last sentence quoted is not an accurate translation from the original Spanish version, which reads: \"En el supuesto que el Concedente no cumpla con sus obligaciones, deber\u00e1 declarar rescindido el Contrato.\"\n\n257.\n\nThe Claimant has read this sentence as if the subject of the verb \"deber\u00e1\" were the Concessionaire. However, the Concessionaire is not mentioned at all in the sentence and it is more logical to consider the \"Concedente\" (the Grantor) as the subject. This reading is consistent with the first paragraph of the Article which refers to the ability of the Concessionaire to request the termination of the Agreement (\"podr\u00e1 solicitar\"). The mandatory use of \"deber\u00e1\" (\"shall\") would also seem to refer to the obligation of the Grantor since the Concessionaire may or may not wish to pursue its right. If the subject of the sentence were the Concessionaire, the term \"may\" would have been more appropriate.\n\n258.\n\nThis interpretation fits with Article 49-II of the Law that provides:\n\n\"The rescission of the contract or the salvaging of the services must be resolved by the Provincial Executive Authority with the intervention of ORAB.\"\n\nThis text does not differentiate between rescission at the initiative or the nonperformance of one or the other of the parties. In all cases, the issue must be resolved by the Grantor. In the specific case of the Concession Agreement, the Grantor had no alternative but to declare the termination if its noncompliance continued, but this is where the parties disagreed. Both parties alleged noncompliance as a cause for their respective rescission of the Concession Agreement.\n\n259.\n\nThe above interpretation does not match the procedure for the rescission of the Concession Agreement on grounds of the Grantor's fault in Article 14.4.4. When the Concession Agreement is terminated because of the Concessionaire's fault, Article 14.4.3 provides that the Concessionaire shall deliver the service once it has been notified of the decree of the Grantor terminating the Concession. In contrast, Article 14.4.4 does not refer to any administrative act of the Grantor to rescind the Concession Agreement. It simply states that \"Once the Contract shall have been terminated because of the Grantor's fault\u2026\" without indicating by whom or by what action. The comparison of the two provisions seems to reflect the difference between the procedure to be followed by a public authority which acts through decrees and resolutions and a private party which may simply notify the Grantor.\n\n260.\n\nThe difficulty in interpreting the provisions of Article 14 harmoniously is compounded by Article 49-II of the Law which, as already noted, prescribes that termination \"must be resolved by the Provincial Executive Authority with the intervention of ORAB.\" The Law does not distinguish between termination by the Grantor or the Concessionaire. It would seem appropriate that the Concession Agreement be interpreted consistently with the provisions of the Law. On the other hand, the Tribunal cannot ignore the practical result of this interpretation: if taken to the extreme, a concessionaire would be obliged to continue to provide the service indefinitely at the discretion of the government and its right to terminate the Concession Agreement would be deprived of any content. For this reason, the application of the maxim *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* provides a balance to the relationship between the government and the concessionaire. The Tribunal considers it immaterial whether ABA raised this defense in its recourse to the Argentine courts. The Tribunal is assessing the conduct of the Respondent and its instrumentalities in the exercise of its public authority against the standards of protection of foreign investors agreed in the BIT, and the application of the maxim *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* has been raised by the Claimant in these proceedings. This exception is not unknown to Argentine law and to legal systems generally as it is a reflection of the principle of good faith. The Tribunal will take it into account when evaluating the actions of the Province under the standards of protection.\n\n261.\n\nThe Respondent has also raised the issue of the compatibility of the BIT with human rights treaties. The matter has not been fully argued and the Tribunal fails to understand the incompatibility in the specifics of the instant case. The services to consumers continued to be provided without interruption by ABA during five months after the termination notice and through the new provincial utility after the transfer of service.\n\n**9. Conduct of the Province after Service Transfer**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n262.\n\nThe Claimant points out that, on March 20, 2002, the ORAB issued Resolution 20/02 preventing ABA from collecting amounts owed in its accounts receivables for services provided prior to the date the service was transferred. Two days later an announcement in the press advised the public that all amounts payable to ABA for service before March 7, 2002 and not yet paid should be paid to the new service provider, and that payments made to ABA would not be honored. ABA requested the bankruptcy court to issue a protective measure. This measure was issued on June 4, 2002, \"ordering the appropriate entities and agencies to refrain from collecting payments on invoices issued for services rendered by Azurix during periods preceding March 7, 2002, which shall only be paid to the debtor in these reorganization proceedings, at the domicile of such company. Furthermore, in the event that payments have already been collected on any such invoice, the appropriate entities shall deposit such amounts into an account opened for these proceedings and all other amounts shall be deposited at the Tribunales branch of Banco de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires.\"197\n\nMemorial, p. 144 and Exhibit 203.\n\n263.\n\nThe Claimant notes that only one sanction had been imposed on ABA before the letter of July 18, 2001. Thereafter, there was a radical change and numerous penalties were levied against ABA as a clear harassment by the Province. The ORAB continued to impose sanctions on ABA even after the service was transferred. The Province was driven by the bankruptcy proceedings and the deadline to request the court to allow their claims. The deadline was June 3, 2002 and on such date the Province and its instrumentalities filed claims for AR$187 million and US$2.85 million as compared to AR$15 million by all other creditors. The Claimant points out that the claims were filed four days before ABA itself was notified by Resolution No. 46/02, dated June 7, 2002, and that ABA was denied access to the documentation on which the penalty was based and an extension of the deadline to file an appeal. ABA filed an appeal to the trustee in bankruptcy who, according to the Claimant, considered most of the claims without merit.198\n\nIbid., p. 135 and pp.145-146.\n\n264.\n\nBased on the report of the University of La Plata (\"UNLP Report\"),199 the ORAB adopted Resolution No. 52/02 approving the final credit and debit account of the Concession resulting in a credit of the Province against ABA of AR$640 million. According to the Claimant, the supporting documentation and a request for an extension of the deadline to file an appeal were denied. ABA filed an appeal on September 30, 2002 based on the hypothetical nature of the claims and their lack of grounds. Specifically, the Claimant alleges that damages concerning assets were estimated even though the ORAB never made the inventory required by Sections 14.4.3 and 14.4.4 of the Concession Agreement; the cost of new water and sewage connections were claimed although the Province released the new provider of making such investments; obligations not enforceable until years 3 and 5 of the Concession were considered unfulfilled and related damages were claimed; and damages concerning the same assets were duplicated. Furthermore, the credit and debit account includes hypothetical damages such as the loss in tax collections caused by the loss of possible increases in real estate properties value due to the interruption of the POES, the cost of a new bidding for the Concession which was never organized, increases in tax collection that the Province could have obtained from hotel, restaurant and tourism activities if ABA had continued as Concessionaire for 30 years.200\n\nExhibit 175 to the Counter-Memorial.\n\nMemorial, pp. 146-148.\n\n265.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, the Respondent contests that the penalties reflected anything more than the non-performance of ABA. The Respondent notes first that the Claimant had failed to indicate to the Tribunal that ABA had a penalty holiday of six months after the takeover of the Concession. This grace period was a change introduced to the model contract included in the Bidding Documents. There was no doubt that such grace period was not part of the draft contract as confirmed by a reply of the Privatization Commission to a question.201 The Respondent cites two other penalties imposed on ABA by Resolution No. 34/00 and Resolution No. 50/00. The Respondent points out that before imposing a penalty ORAB had to determine nonperformance and follow the pertinent administrative proceedings. It was not a hostile attitude but respect for the administrative procedures to impose sanctions.202\n\nRejoinder, para. 551, footnote 397, and Circular 21(A), reply to question 92.\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 559-569.\n\n266.\n\nAccording to the Respondent and on the basis of the UNLP Report, the damages to be borne by the Province as a result of failure to meet the goals undertaken in the POES and termination of the Concession Agreement for causes attributable to ABA exceeded AR$149 million and the economic impact of the environmental damages caused by ABA amounted to over AR$467 million.203 The Respondent observes that, in the statement of credits in favor of the Province, the amount collected for service prior to March 7, 2002 has been taken into account and that the relevant protective measure was revoked on appeal by the Commercial Court of Appeal. The Respondent also notes that ABA brought an action against Decree 508/02 terminating the Concession Agreement before the Supreme Court of the Province.204\n\nIbid., pp. 240-241.\n\nIbid., para. 823.\n\n267.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant alleges that the sanctions imposed on ABA were part of a strategy to overwhelm Azurix's claim in these proceedings. They were a set of measures taken in a wider context of abusive measures by the Province and Argentina, including measures taken after the Decision on Provisional Measures of this Tribunal.205\n\nIbid., paras. 602-603.\n\n268.\n\nIn its analysis of the penalties imposed, the Claimant finds that: (i)14 out 16 fines were imposed after the termination of the Concession Agreement by ABA, (ii) during the two months that Decrees No. 2598/01 and 3039/01 were issued, ABA was fined seven times for a total of US$555,000, (iii) seven more fines were imposed after the transfer of the service for a total of US$1,960,000, and (iv) four fines for a total of US$1,800,000 were levied between the filing of reorganization proceedings and the deadline for creditors to file a petition for allowance of claims.206\n\nIbid., para. 590.\n\n269.\n\nThe Claimant points out, in particular, that the fine for the violation of biological parameters in Bah\u00eda Blanca related to an incident that happened in April 2000 and ORAB did not file the charge until August 2001, and that in the case of 14 out of 16 fines, the drafts were prepared from July 2001 onwards.207\n\nIbid., paras. 591-592.\n\n270.\n\nThe Claimant observes that the six-month grace period is customary in this type of agreements to allow the concessionaires to adapt to the poor service management conditions that existed before privatization.208\n\nIbid., para. 600.\n\n271.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, the Respondent enumerates 12 procedures underway at the time when ABA terminated the Concession Agreement to show that the process had started long before July 18, 2001 and before the penalties were imposed. The failures of ABA range from the breakage of an aqueduct, to over billing, breakage of a master pipe, deficiencies in operation and reconditioning of effluent purifying plants, lack of water quality standards at Bah\u00eda Blanca and Vedia.209 According to the Respondent, every single fine was imposed for a specific violation of the Concession Agreement by ABA. It was ABA that was exclusively responsible for supplying drinking water that met the quality and standards agreed in the Concession agreement and for performing under the POES.210\n\nIbid., para. 571 and Rejoinder, paras. 456-533.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 555 and 557.\n\n272.\n\nThe Respondent further notes that the Claimant in its Reply did not refer to the specific grounds of termination set forth in Decree 508/02, nor the effect of ABA's filing for bankruptcy and ENRON's bankruptcy on the Concession Agreement, nor ABA's filing against Decree 508/02.211\n\nIbid., paras. 842-850.\n\n273.\n\nAs to the damage sustained by the Province, the Respondent defends the calculation of the economic impact of the termination of the Concession as part of the damages for which ABA is liable and quotes from the UNLP Report: \"The reasons that led the Province to start the bidding process \u2013 in which Azurix voluntarily submitted its bid \u2013 were to achieve positive environmental, sanitary, economic, fiscal, and operating results. All these privatization purposes may be assessed in economic terms. Azurix assessed them in order to submit the bid that secured Azurix the award of the contract; and the Province should assess them in order to determine the costs of the failure and seek fair compensation.\"212\n\nIbid., quoted in para. 854. Emphasis of the Respondent.\n\n274.\n\nThe Respondent concludes on this point by observing that the allowance of the Province's claim against ABA has yet to be adjudicated by the bankruptcy court.213\n\nIbid., para 858.\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n275.\n\nThe Claimant has not questioned the underlying reasons for the penalties except in the case of Bah\u00eda Blanca and the fines and claims taken into account in the credit and debit account of the Concession, in particular the claims based on the UNLP Report. As noted by the Claimant, it is striking to note the contrast of administrative speed with which the fines and claims were processed after ABA gave notice of termination of the Concession and the deliberate pace with which other administrative matters were handled such as the construction variations or the valuations 2000. The Tribunal is surprised that the underlying documentation on which Resolutions 46/02 and 52/02 were based would be denied to ABA for purposes of filing an administrative appeal. The Tribunal is equally surprised that damages against ABA would be assessed in part on considerations that do not find any basis in the Concession Agreement or the Law.\n\n**VII. Breach of the BIT**\n--------------------------\n\n**1. Expropriation without compensation**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n276.\n\nAzurix claims that its investment, the Concession Agreement, has been expropriated as a result of \"measures tantamount to expropriation\". For Azurix, what is important is not the form of the measures or their intent but their consequences. Azurix argues that the expropriation of its contract rights \u2013 and contract rights are included in the definition of investment - is the consequence of a series of acts that alone may not be sufficient to constitute expropriation but taken together constitute creeping expropriation. Based on a review of case law and authorities, the Claimant defines this type of expropriation as \"unreasonable or incidental interference that significantly deprives an owner of the control, use, benefits, enjoyment, access to, or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefits of property, rights or interests to an extent that is more than ephemeral.\"214 Azurix notes that public utility companies are particularly exposed to this type of measures because the privatizing State \"may be tempted to exploit the company once it has constructed a water system. When the water system is built the company can no longer walk away and take the pipelines with it, but is at the mercy of the regulator.\"215 The Claimant further observes that \"The political capture of rents is equivalent to asset expropriation, as the company \u2013 whether public or private \u2013 will be unable to reap the rewards associated with those sunk costs.\"216\n\nMemorial, p.166.\n\nIbid., p. 169 quoting from a World Bank study.\n\nIbid., p. 168.\n\n277.\n\nAccording to Azurix, the Province took away Azurix's rights under the tariff regime of the Concession, compromised the ability of ABA to obtain financing, saddled ABA with unexpected expenses by not finishing the promised infrastructure included in Circular 31(A), and took away Azurix's right to recover fully the Canon. After paying for the Concession, \"Provincial officials used Azurix's investment as their personal 'whipping boy' to stir the pot of ratepayer anger caused by years of neglect of the water infrastructure and misdirect it towards ABA.\" The Province broke the Regulatory Compact and signaled that it was not committed to a sustainable Concession. To conclude, \"Under any plausible construction of expropriation, the Province and the Republic deprived Azurix of the use and enjoyment of the reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefits of the Concession and expropriated its investments.\"217\n\nIbid., p. 180.\n\n278.\n\nThe Respondent contests the definition of creeping expropriation arrived at by the Claimant. The Respondent argues that a central aspect of the test related to the notion of unlawfulness or unreasonableness is missing in that definition: \"only if Buenos Aires Province has ignored ABA's contractual rights may an evaluation be made about whether or not an expropriation has occurred. If Buenos Aires Province has not ignored Azurix's contractual rights, there is no expropriation to complain about.\"218 According to the Respondent, the Province acted at all times in accordance with the Law and the Concession Agreement. On the other hand, there has been a gradual violation of both by ABA which, from the beginning, attempted to renegotiate the Concession Agreement under more convenient terms to its own satisfaction and has failed to meet its obligations under the POES. According to Argentina, citing *Lauder* and *S.D. Myers*, in order to determine whether or not an expropriation has occurred the government's intention may not be disregarded:\n\n\"Detrimental effect on the economic value of property is not sufficient; Parties to [the Bilateral Treaty] are not liable for economic injury that is the consequence of *bona fide* regulation within the accepted police powers of the State.219\n\n\"Both words ['tantamount' and 'expropriation'] require a tribunal to look at the substance of what occurred and not only at form. A tribunal should not be deterred by technical or facial considerations from reaching a conclusion that an expropriation has occurred. It must look at the real interests involved and the purpose and effect of the government measure.\" (emphasis added by the Respondent).220\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 944.\n\n*Lauder v. Czech Republic*, UNCITRAL, Final Award, September 3, 2001, para. 198, quoted in Counter-Memorial, para. 950.\n\n*S.D. Myers* v. *Canada*, Partial Award of November 13, 2000, para. 285, quoted in the CounterMemorial, para 950.\n\n279.\n\nThe Respondent argues that respecting a contract may never be held to be an expropriation. The Concession Agreement stipulated the tariff structure for the entire term of the Concession, \"an error in the Concession fee calculation might not be invoked for amending the tariffs.\"221 If investment risk in the case of utilities is usually considered low, as stated by Azurix, this is because the utility provider knows \"in advance the tariff regime to be applied throughout the term of the concession before submitting the Offer.\"222\n\nIbid., para. 952.\n\nIbid., para. 953.\n\n280.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that the sunken cost argument made by Azurix does not apply in this case; it was the Province that installed the infrastructure and the fee paid was to exercise \"the natural monopoly facilitated by the investment previously made by the State.\"223\n\nIbid., para. 957.\n\n281.\n\nThe Respondent comments in relation to the tariff conflicts that, except in one case, they all referred to the non-metered regime which was a temporary regime, and, as regards the exception, no damage occurred because the tariff increase sought was based on a cost increase that never existed. The Respondent refers again to *S.D. Myers* where the tribunal held, on the facts of the case that a temporary measure should not be characterized as an expropriation, \"the evidence did not support a transfer of property or benefit directly to others, simply an opportunity was delayed\".224 The Respondent points out that a reasonable period of time needs to pass to examine whether or not measures actually have the expropriating effect attributed to them, and that time is also important to determine when the expropriation took place:\n\n\"According to Azurix's conduct \u2026 the investment conflict had already arisen by January 5, 2001, that is to say only a few months after having executed the contract. This position is untenable and purely speculative. The operability of a Concession such as Azurix had in its hand is not defined in less than eighteen months. Moreover, validating the way Azurix acted would mean rewarding selffulfilling prophecies. Azurix could not have negotiated in good faith because the investment conflict it was claiming could not have possibly arisen.\"225\n\nIbid., para. 967.\n\nIbid., para. 971.\n\n282.\n\nIn the Reply, the Claimant argues that the measures alleged to constitute tantamount to expropriation are not limited to mere breaches of contract. The Claimant brings to the attention of the Tribunal that the tariff regime incorporated into the contract also represents \"part of a regulatory system established by law whereby the regulatory agency \u2026 -which is not a direct party to the contract \u2013 unilaterally interprets the Tariff Regime and holds the power to order the implementation of its interpretations. That is not a normal contract situation, and the refusal of the ORAB properly to interpret and implement the Tariff System is not a mere contract breach, although it does breach the contract as well.\"226\n\nReply, para. 641.\n\n283.\n\nThe Claimant lists, as other measures tantamount to expropriation beyond the repudiation of the tariff regime, the repudiation by the Province of representations and assurances provided in the bidding process through circulars and information communiqu\u00e9s, the public call for customers not to pay their bills in August 1999 when the equalization subsidy was eliminated, the public calls by the provincial Governor and the Mayor of Bah\u00eda Blanca for users not to pay their water bills, the incorrect public statements by provincial office holders that the Concessionaire was wholly responsible for the incident, the incorrect public statements by public officials creating hysteria by suggesting that the water was toxic, the ORAB resolutions not allowing ABA to collect for its services, etc.227\n\nIbid., paras. 643-644.\n\n284.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, in any case, breaches of contract may constitute an expropriation and cites internal legislation of the United States, a party to the BIT, where it is stated that 'any abrogation, repudiation, or impairment by a foreign government of its own contract with an investor \u2026 and [which] materially adversely affects the continued operation of the project \u2026'\"228 According to the Claimant, breach of contract or actions affecting contract rights may constitute an expropriation in certain situations: a breach of contract which is part of a series of acts that combined would have the effect of a creeping expropriation (*Waste Management*), a fundamental breach of contract, which goes to the heart of the performance promised and adversely affects the continued operation of the project subject of the contract (*BP v. Libyan Arab Republic*), regulatory conduct that denies contract rights or requires their alteration (*CME v. Czech Republic*), repudiation of specific contract rights or a contract as a whole (*Phillips Petroleum v. Iran*), and a breach of a stabilization clause in a contract (*Agip v. Congo*).229\n\nIbid., para. 647.\n\nIbid., para. 648.\n\n285.\n\nAs regards whether the deprivation of rights or benefits is ephemeral, the Claimant observes that the relevant inquiry is the duration of the deprivation of rights or benefits, nor the duration of the expropriatory acts themselves. First, there is no set duration for a period of time to be classified as being more than ephemeral in international law. The Claimant in this respect refers to the General Conditions of Guarantee for Equity Investments of MIGA which require that the failure by an administrative agency to act remain uncured for one year. Second, the measures of the Province were permanent measures: ABA was permanently deprived from its right to eliminate the zoning subsidy, so were the repudiation of Circular 52(A) and the contract rights embodied in Articles 7.8 and 12.1.1 of the Concession Agreement to treat the Canon payment as an investment, the actions of the Province resulted in the permanent denial of multilateral financing, the Province permanently refused to return the unamortized portion of the Canon payment, the Province permanently repudiated the contractual rights to calculate tariffs in US dollars and to index the tariffs by US indexes. The effect of these measures was to drive ABA into bankruptcy and permanently put it out of business.230\n\nIbid., para. 655\n\n286.\n\nAccording to the Claimant the notion advanced by the Respondent - that there cannot be an expropriation without an effect on an investor's contractual rights -ignores the authorities and the case law. According to the Claimant, \"Conduct contrary to an investor's legitimate expectations that constitute a norm or were induced by the government also can amount to expropriation.\"231 The Claimant refers to a long line of case law to prove this point, \"*Middle East Cement*, *Goetz*, *Metalclad*, *Tecmed*, and other recent cases,\" demonstrate that a State's actions need not affect formal contractual rights in order to constitute expropriation. Contrary to the GOA's assertions, the case law shows that actions that have the effect of depriving a foreign investor of the 'reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit' of an investment can amount to an expropriation even if the actions do not affect or alter contract rights.\"232\n\nIbid., para. 660.\n\nIbid., para. 666.\n\n287.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, expropriation also exists when a State repudiates former assurances or refuses to give assurances that it will comply with its obligations, \"which deprives the investor, in whole or significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of its investment constitutes an expropriation. Similarly, Azurix was deprived of the reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of its investment in the Concession and is entitled to compensation for this expropriation.\"233\n\nIbid., para. 228.\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimant alleges also loss of control of its investment as grounds for expropriation. The effect of the measures taken not only took away the financial benefits from the Concession by making it unsustainable, but also stripped the investment of its legal security. The Claimant relies in particularly on *Revere* where the tribunal held that \"the government's actions were expropriatory because they repudiated contract rights resulting in the inability of the investor to make rational, calculated decisions based on known contract rights, thus causing the investor to lose control of the investment.\"234\n\nIbid., para. 681.\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent in its Rejoinder explains that its reference to contract rights in the Counter-Memorial was motivated by the fact that Azurix had based its claims on breaches of contract rights. The Respondent then relies on *Serbian Loans*, *Woofruff*, *ELSI* and, in particular, *Vivendi*, *SGS v. Pakistan* and *SGS v. Philippines* to contest that contractual claims should be heard before arbitral tribunals. It is clear, according to the Respondent, that \"arbitration tribunals do not accept hearing domestic contractual claims as if they were genuine international claims.\"235 According to the Respondent, if \"the Tribunal understood the substance of the claim in the way Azurix does, said Tribunal would lack jurisdiction and the award would be clearly null.\"236\n\nRejoinder, para. 971. Emphasis in the original.\n\nIbid., para. 980.\n\n290.\n\nThe Respondent then alleges that Azurix introduces a confusion by contending that umbrella clauses apply beyond specific investment agreements, in reality, these clauses can only be applied in case of an investment agreement breach but not for a breach of a concession agreement governed by the domestic and administrative law agreed in the forum clause: \"Azurix intently confuses Investment Agreement with investment, terms that are not equivalent or amalgamable.\"237\n\nIbid., para. 981.\n\n291.\n\nArgentina also argues against a pro-investor interpretation of the BIT. By protecting investors and investment broadly, the treaties would come to be regarded as guarantees and assurances, eliminating the notion of risk and venture as stated by the tribunal in *Tecmed.* According to Argentina, in this case the tribunal had, \"to consider the elements forming the standard banning expropriation without compensation, it was far from claiming broad and vague interpretative assumptions in favor of the investor based on BIT supposed purposes. On the contrary, it acknowledged the principle of deference to the State in order to define the public interest or usefulness reasons upon which its actions are founded.\"238\n\nIbid., quote in para. 985.\n\n292.\n\nArgentina alleges that, in the Reply, the Claimant tries to reformulate the standard so that it can be read \"exactly in the same way as what is under the protection of the general clauses (*umbrella clauses*).\" According to Argentina, the Claimant alleges that some of the actions were expropriatory *per se*. The Respondent explains that in a progressive expropriation no action in itself is expropriatory. The Respondent relies on the dissident opinion of Keith Highet in *Waste Management* :\n\n\"a 'creeping expropriation' is comprised of a number of elements, none of which can - separately \u2013 constitute the international wrong. These constituent elements include non-payment, non-reimbursement, cancellation, denial of judicial access, actual practice to exclude, non-conforming treatment, inconsistent legal blocks, and so forth. The \u2018measure' at issue is the expropriation itself; it is not merely a sub-component part of expropriation.\"239\n\nIbid., quote in para. 1001.\n\n293.\n\nThe Respondent also quotes from *Santa Elena*,\n\n\"As it is well known, there is a wide spectrum of measures that a state may take in asserting control over property, extending from limited regulation of its use to a complete and formal deprivation of the owner's legal title. Likewise, the period of time involved in the process may vary \u2013 from an immediate and comprehensive taking to one that gradually and by small steps reaches a condition in which it can be said that the owner has truly lost all attributes of ownership. It is clear, however, that a measure or a series of measures can still eventually amount to a taking though the individual steps in the process do not formally purport to amount to a taking or to a transfer of title. What has to be identified is the extent to which the measures taken have deprived the owner of the normal control of his property.\"240\n\nIbid., quote in para. 1003.\n\n294.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Respondent, in a creeping expropriation what matters is not the duration of the effects but the intensity of the expropriatory process. The Respondent contests the affirmation by the Claimant that international law fixes an exact limit as regards when to determine a creeping expropriation, only a reasonable period of time is required. The Respondent also contests the interpretation of MIGA's General Conditions and observes that they have been only partially quoted by the Claimant. These Conditions require that, for some measures, the company concerned should not have been able, for three years, to operate without losses. In any case, the time would run from the measure that culminates in the expropriation, since none of the preceding measures *per se* constituted expropriation.\n\n295.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the individual effect of each measure may never be expropriatory; to determine if a series of measures has an expropriatory effect, the intensity of the process globally considered should be measured; the expropriatory effect should have lasted until it consolidated and could be considered a permanent effect; the set time to lapse is not defined by international law as an algorithm, but it requires the passing of reasonable time.241\n\nIbid., para. 1017.\n\n296.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with Azurix's insistence exclusively on the effect of the measures as the key element to determine whether an expropriation has occurred. There is another element. The investor needs to have a right to the specific treatment expected, \"If there is no legal right to be treated in a specific manner, no expropriation can be considered when someone is treated according to the law.\" In this respect, the Respondent refers to the tribunal's finding in *Feldman* that NAFTA and principles of customary international law do not require a State to permit a gray market of cigarette exports. Mexican law did not afford cigarette resellers a right to export cigarettes and the claimant's investment remained under its complete control and with the right to export other Mexican products.242\n\nIbid., para. 1022.\n\n297.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent argues that the effect and intent of measures cannot be separated as Azurix has done. The intent is important to differentiate between legitimate regulation and confiscatory regulation. The Respondent refers approvingly to the statement in *Feldman* that,\n\n\"not all government regulatory activity that makes it difficult or impossible for an investor to carry out a particular business, change in the law or change in the application of existing laws that makes it uneconomical to continue a particular business, is an expropriation under Article 1110. Governments, in their exercise of regulatory power, frequently change their laws and regulations in response to changing economic circumstances or changing political, economic or social considerations. Those changes may well make certain activities less profitable or even uneconomic to continue.\"243\n\nIbid., quote in para. 1024.\n\n298.\n\nThe Respondent further refers to *Generation Ukraine,*\n\n\"Predictability is one of the most important objectives of any legal system. It would be useful if it were absolutely clear in advance whether particular events fall within the definition of an \u2018indirect' expropriation. It would enhance the sentiment of respect for legitimate expectations if it were perfectly obvious why, in the context of a particular decision, an arbitration tribunal found that a governmental action or inaction crossed the line that defines acts amounting to an indirect expropriation. But there is no checklist, no mechanical test to achieve that purpose. The decisive considerations vary from case to case, depending not only on the specific facts of a grievance but also on the way the evidence is presented, and the legal bases pleaded. The outcome is a judgment, *i.e*., the product of discernment, and not the printout of a computer program.\"244\n\nIbid., quote in para. 1027.\n\n299.\n\nFaced with the task of judging, the tribunal in *Generation Ukraine*, set some negative criteria that the Respondent quotes as supporting its argument that mere effect is not enough:\n\n\"The fact that an investment has become worthless obviously does not mean that there was an act of expropriation; investment always entails risk. Nor is it sufficient for the disappointed investor to point to some governmental initiative, or inaction, which might have contributed to its ill fortune. Yet again, it is not enough for an investor to seize upon an act of maladministration, no matter how low the level of the relevant governmental authority; to abandon his investment without any effort at overturning the administrative fault; and thus to claim an international delict on the theory that there had been an uncompensated virtual expropriation. In such instances, an international tribunal may deem that the failure to seek redress from national authorities disqualifies the international claim, not because there is a requirement of exhaustion of local remedies but because the very reality of conduct tantamount to expropriation is doubtful in the absence of a reasonable \u2013 not necessarily exhaustive \u2013 effort by the investor to obtain correction.\"\n\n300.\n\nAnd further,\n\n\"There is, of course, no formal obligation upon the Claimant to exhaust local remedies before resorting to ICSID arbitration pursuant to the BIT. Nevertheless, in the absence of any *per se* violation of the BIT discernible from the relevant conduct of the Kyiv City State Administration, the only possibility in this case for the series of complaints relating to highly technical matters of Ukrainian planning law to be transformed into a BIT violation would have been for the Claimant to be denied justice before the Ukrainian courts in a *bona fide* attempt to resolve these technical matters.\"245\n\nIbid., quote in para. 1029.\n\n301.\n\nArgentina agrees with this consideration of the tribunal \"to avoid becoming an administrative tribunal that conscientiously goes through the actions and omissions of the host State administrative bodies.\"246\n\nIbid.\n\n302.\n\nAs regards the protection of the investor's expectations, the Respondent affirms that the cases adduced by the Claimant do not support the Claimant's contentions because Azurix's claim is based completely on alleged contractual breaches by the Province.247 Addressing the specific cases, Argentina argues that the *Aminoil* tribunal never analyzed whether Kuwait had expropriated legitimate expectations from the private petroleum company, but it considered that contractual rights have been expropriated. Legitimate expectations are not the basis for expropriation but the measure of compensation. Argentina considers that the same is true of *Middle East Cement*. This case simply shows that the contractual rights of the investor are able to be expropriated even when a contract has not been formally terminated and its contractual rights had been *de facto* revoked. Argentina points out that, in *Goetz*, the tribunal did not make a finding regarding legitimate expectations, but whether rights conferred by a unilateral act \u2013such as granting of a license- can also be expropriated. Argentina considers that *Metalclad* and *Tecmed* are not applicable because in neither of these cases Mexico had entered into a contract with the investor and hence it was impossible for the tribunals to decide in favor of the expropriation of contractual rights.248\n\nIbid., para. 1049.\n\nIbid., paras. 1053-1062.\n\n303.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that there were no contractual breaches by the Province and that, if there had been, as held in *Waste Management*, contractual breaches did not generate international responsibility:\n\n\"In the Tribunal's view, an enterprise is not expropriated just because its debts are not paid or other contractual obligations towards it are breached. There was no outright repudiation of the transaction in the present case, and if the City entered into the Concession Agreement on the basis of an over-optimistic assessment of the possibilities, so did Acaverde. It is not the function of Article 1110 to compensate for failed business ventures, absent arbitrary intervention by the State amounting to a virtual taking or sterilising of the enterprise.\"249\n\nIbid., quote in para. 1063.\n\n304.\n\nAnd,\n\n\"The Tribunal concludes that it is one thing to expropriate a right under a contract and another to fail to comply with the contract. Non-compliance by a government with contractual obligations is not the same thing as, or equivalent or tantamount to, an expropriation. In the present case the Claimant did not lose its contractual rights, which it was free to pursue before the contractually chosen forum. The law of breach of contract is not secreted in the interstices of Article 1110 of NAFTA. Rather it is necessary to show an effective repudiation of the right, unredressed by any remedies available to the Claimant, which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a substantial extent.\"250\n\nIbid., quote in footnote 885.\n\n305.\n\nThe Respondent concludes by referring to the Regulatory Framework, the Bidding Conditions and the Concession Agreement. The Respondent affirms that the circulars and information communiqu\u00e9s had no power to modify substantially the established contractual system, which had been known and accepted by Azurix and ABA and hence \"it is not possible that Azurix may construe, in good faith, that there had been alleged rights or expectations, which are manifestly in conflict with this normative system.\"251\n\nIbid., para. 1067.\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n306.\n\nThe parties' arguments raise issues ranging from whether the BIT should be interpreted in favor of the investor to the requirements of expropriation measures in terms of effect, intention and duration, and whether such measures may, or may not necessarily, be contractual breaches which cumulatively may be tantamount to expropriation or the taking of the benefits legitimately expected by the investor. The Tribunal will now address these arguments in that order.\n\n***(i) Interpretation of the BIT***\n-----------------------------------\n\n307.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that the BIT should be interpreted in favor or against the investor. The BIT is an international treaty and should be interpreted in accordance with the interpretation norms set forth by the Vienna Convention on the Law of the Treaties (\u2018the Vienna Convention\"), which is binding on the States parties to the BIT. Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention requires that a treaty be \"interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in light of its object and purpose.\" The Tribunal observes that the BIT itself is an instrument agreed by the two State parties to encourage and protect investment. In the preamble of the BIT, the parties agreed that \"fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective use of economic resources\". Therefore, the BIT itself is a document that requires certain treatment of investment which the parties have considered necessary to \"stimulate the flow of private capital\". The Tribunal in interpreting the BIT must be mindful of the objective the parties intended to pursue by concluding it.\n\n***(ii) Effect, Intent and Duration of Expropriation Measures***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n308.\n\nThe parties agree that cumulative steps which individually may not qualify as an expropriating measure may have the effect equivalent to an outright expropriation. The parties also agree on the varied nature of possible steps, including breach of contract: the Respondent affirms that if the Province had \"ignored ABA's contractual rights an evaluation could be made about whether or not an expropriation has occurred.\"252 The Respondent has adduced Mr. Highet's definition of creeping expropriation, which includes in the list of examples of possible constituent elements non-payment and non-reimbursement, elements which refer to contractual nonperformance. On the other hand, the Respondent has also relied on holdings of the tribunal in *Waste Management* to the effect that breach of contract is not the same as expropriation of a contractual right.\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 180.\n\n309.\n\nThe parties disagree on the relevance of taking into account the intent pursued by the measures concerned and the time needed for the measures to consolidate into a creeping expropriation. Whether to consider only the effect of measures tantamount to expropriation or consider both the effect and purpose of the measures is a point on which not only the parties disagree but also arbitral tribunals. In *Santa Elena*, that the Respondent found a useful point of reference for the concept of creeping expropriation, the tribunal did not take into account the environmental purpose of the expropriatory measures: \"Expropriatory environmental measures \u2013 no matter how laudable and beneficial to society as a whole \u2013 are, in this respect, similar to any other expropriatory measures that a state may take in order to implement its policies: where property is expropriated, even for environmental purposes, whether domestic or international, the state's obligation to pay compensation remains.\"253 The same tribunal was persuaded by the finding in *Tippetts* that \"The intent of the government is less important than the effects of the measures on the owner, and the form of the measures of control or interference is less important than the reality of their impact.\"254\n\n*Compa\u00f1ia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award, para. 72.\n\nIbid., para. 77. Translation by the Tribunal.\n\n310.\n\nFor the Tribunal, the issue is not so much whether the measure concerned is legitimate and serves a public purpose, but whether it is a measure that, being legitimate and serving a public purpose, should give rise to a compensation claim. In the exercise of their public policy function, governments take all sorts of measures that may affect the economic value of investments without such measures giving rise to a need to compensate. The tribunal in *S.D. Myers* found the purpose of a regulatory measure a helpful criterion to distinguish measures for which a State would not be liable: \"Parties [to the Bilateral Treaty] are not liable for economic injury that is the consequence of *bona fide* regulation within the accepted police powers of the State.\"255 This Tribunal finds the criterion insufficient and shares the concern expressed by Judge R. Higgins, who questioned whether the difference between expropriation and regulation based on public purpose was intellectually viable:\n\n\"Is not the State in both cases (that is, either by a taking for a public purpose, or by regulating) purporting to act in the common good? And in each case has the owner of the property not suffered loss? Under international law standards, a regulation that amounted (by virtue of its scope and effect) to a taking, would need to be \u2018for a public purpose' (in the sense of in general, rather than for a private interest). And just compensation would be due. At the same time, interferences with property for economic and financial regulatory purposes are tolerated to a significant extent.\"256\n\nCounter-Memorial, quote in para. 950.\n\n\"The Taking of Property by the state: Recent Developments in International Law\", *Recueil des Cours*, vol. III (1982), p. 331.\n\n311.\n\nThe argument made by the *S.D. Myers* tribunal is somehow contradictory. According to it, the BIT would require that investments not be expropriated except for a public purpose and that there be compensation if such expropriation takes place and, at the same time, regulatory measures that may be tantamount to expropriation would not give rise to a claim for compensation if taken for a public purpose. The public purpose criterion as an additional criterion to the effect of the measures under consideration needs to be complemented. The parties have referred in their exchanges to findings of the tribunal in *Tecmed*. That tribunal sought guidance in the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, in particular, in the case of *James and Others.* The Court held that \"a measure depriving a person of his property [must] pursue, on the facts as well as in principle, a legitimate aim \u2018in the public interest'\", and bear \"a reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be realized\". This proportionality will not be found if the person concerned bears \"an individual and excessive burden\". The Court considered that such \"a measure must be both appropriate for achieving its aim and not disproportionate thereto.\" The Court found relevant that non-nationals \"will generally have played no part in the election or designation of its [of the measure] authors nor have been consulted on its adoption\", and observed that \"there may well be legitimate reason for requiring nationals to bear a greater burden in the public interest than non-nationals.\"257\n\n*In the case of James and Others*, sentence of 21 February 1986, paras. 50 and 63, and *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A.* v. *The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), paras. 121-122.\n\n312.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that these additional elements provide useful guidance for purposes of determining whether regulatory actions would be expropriatory and give rise to compensation.\n\n313.\n\nThe parties hold also different views on the time needed for a set of measures to have an expropriatory effect. There is no specific time set under international law for measures constituting creeping expropriation to produce that effect. It will depend on the specific circumstances of the case. Arbitral tribunals have considered that a measure is not ephemeral if the property was out of the control of the investor for a year (*Wena*) or an export license was suspended for four months (*Middle East Cement*), or that the measure was ephemeral if it lasted for three months (*S.D. Myers*) *.* These cases involved a single measure. When considering multiple measures, it will depend on the duration of their cumulative effect. Unfortunately, there is no mathematical formula to reach a mechanical result. How much time is needed must be judged by the specific circumstances of each case. As expressed by the tribunal in *Generation Ukraine* : \"The outcome is a judgment, *i.e*., the product of discernment, and not the printout of a computer program.\"258\n\nRejoinder, quote in para. 1027.\n\n***(iii) Breach of Contract and Expropriation***\n------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nWhether contract rights may be expropriated is widely accepted by the case law and the doctrine. The discussion by the parties reflects more a question of whether in the specifics of the instant case the alleged breaches of the Province can be considered to be such. As repeatedly stated by the Respondent, the Province with its actions did no more than to comply with the Concession Agreement and the Regulatory Framework. Therefore, according to the Respondent, ABA was not entitled to the alleged rights which supposedly the Province ignored.\n\n315.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that contractual breaches by a State party or one of its instrumentalities would not normally constitute expropriation. Whether one or series of such breaches can be considered to be measures tantamount to expropriation will depend on whether the State or its instrumentality has breached the contract in the exercise of its sovereign authority, or as a party to a contract. As already noted, a State or its instrumentalities may perform a contract badly, but this will not result in a breach of treaty provisions, \"unless it be proved that the state or its emanation has gone beyond its role as a mere party to the contract, and has exercised the specific functions of a sovereign.\"259 In considering each of the grounds which the Claimant has advanced to justify its expropriation claim and to the extent that they may be characterized as breaches of the Concession Agreement, the Tribunal will assess them from the perspective of possible breaches of the BIT and of whether they reflect the exercise of specific functions of a sovereign.\n\n*Consortium FRCC c. Royaume du Maroc* (Aff. No. ARB/00/6), Sentence arbitrale, para. 65 See also *Impregilo*, para. 260.\n\n***(iv) Legitimate Expectations***\n----------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nThe issue of whether an expropriation may take place without formally affecting the contract rights has been discussed by the parties in the context of the frustration of the investor's legitimate expectations when a State repudiates former assurances, or refuses to give assurances that it will comply with its obligations depriving the investor in whole or significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of its investment. *Tecmed* is a clear example in which a tribunal took into account the expectations of the investor. Argentina has dismissed the relevance of this case on the basis that Mexico had no contract with the investor. In fact, the tribunal in that case considered attributable to Mexico, as the sovereign, certain acts that frustrated the expectations generated in the investor even when Mexico was not party to the contract. That tribunal determined that the conduct of INE, the Mexican federal agency which had issued the license, was attributable to the government. Hence, the considerations of that tribunal are not without significance for these proceedings:\n\n\"The political and social circumstances [\u2026] which conclusively conditioned the issuance of the Resolution, were shown with all their magnitude after a substantial part of the investment had been made could not have reasonably been foreseen by the Claimant with the scope, effects and consequences that those circumstances had. There is no doubt that, even if Cytrar [the vehicle used by the investor] did not have an indefinite permit but a permit renewable every year, the Claimant's expectation was that of a long-term investment relying on the recovery of its investment and the estimated return through the operation of the Landfill during it entire useful life.\"260\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A.* v. *The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), para 149.\n\n317.\n\nThe tribunal then adds:\n\n\"Both the authorization to operate as landfill, dated May 1994, and the subsequent permits granted by INE, including the Permit, were based on the Environmental Impact Declaration of 1994, which projected a useful life of ten years for the Landfill [footnote deleted]. This shows that even before the Claimant made its investment, it was widely known that the investor expected its investments in the Landfill to last for a long term and that it took this into account to estimate the time and business required to recover such investment and obtain the expected return upon making its tender offer for the acquisition of the assets related to the Landfill. To evaluate if the actions attributable to the Respondent \u2013 as well as the Resolution \u2013 violate the Agreement, such expectations should be considered legitimate and should be evaluated in light of the Agreement and of international law.\"261\n\nIbid., para. 150.\n\n318.\n\nThe expectations as shown in that case are not necessarily based on a contract but on assurances explicit or implicit, or on representations, made by the State which the investor took into account in making the investment. That tribunal, for instance, took into account the declaration of 1994 and the implicit need of a long-term operation of the landfill for the investor to be able to have a reasonable return on the expected investment even when the specific permit was only a one-year permit. In the case before this Tribunal, the Respondent has questioned that any of the alleged expectations may have been created by the Province when these expectations are in conflict with the normative system.262 Whether they actually are in conflict with the normative system of the Concession and they have been frustrated to the extent of depriving the investor of the benefits of the investment is a matter that the Tribunal will now proceed to determine.\n\nRejoinder, para 1067.\n\n319.\n\nThe measures and actions taken by the Province to be considered for purposes of determining whether they amounted to an expropriation are those related to the so called tariff conflicts, Canon recovery, the works under Circular 31(A) and the consequential effect on the ability of ABA to obtain financing. The actions of the provincial authorities in the case of the first tariff conflict and the Bah\u00eda Blanca works exceeded any contractual rights by inviting customers not to pay bills even before the administrative appeal of ABA against the decision of the ORAB was resolved, or notwithstanding the fact that the Province had not completed the works in the Paso las Piedras reservoir that it represented it would complete at the time of the bidding for the Concession. The same can be said of the public threats against officials of the ORAB for allowing ABA to resume billing of customers after the Bah\u00eda Blanca incident. These instances show the politicization of the Concession, as H & S noted, and the lack of commitment of the new provincial authorities to the privatization process undertaken by their predecessors.\n\n320.\n\nThe unhelpful attitude of the authorities is also evident in the procrastination in resolving the issue of the construction variations when the information given the bidders proved to be incorrect and in completing the works under Circular 31(A). Even if no specific date was established for their completion, the percentage of works completed given the bidders and the dates of completion in the respective contracts created a reasonable expectation that the works would be completed. Even if ABA had no right under the Concession Agreement to a revision of tariffs to recover the Canon, it had the right to recover it to the extent that this was feasible within the existing tariff framework; thus statements made by government officials that the Canon was not recoverable were not in accordance with the financial terms of the Concession. There is also no doubt that the image of the Concessionaire was damaged by the actions of the Province vis-\u00e0-vis its customers at the time when it was crucial for the privatized service to take hold.\n\n321.\n\nHowever, the politicization of the Concession or the actions taken by the Province were not the only cause of OPIC's denial of financing. The letter of OPIC referred also to the capital requirements of the Concession as compared to the revenues generated by the existing tariff level were the tariff regime not amended. The conclusions reached by the Tribunal on the recovery of the Canon and the RPI are also significant for purposes of the determination of the degree of impact that the actions of the Province had on Azurix's investment. The Tribunal disagrees with the understanding of the Claimant of the terms of the Law and the Concession Agreement on these matters. Were this not the case, the Tribunal would agree that the breaches of the Concession Agreement would have had a devastating effect on the financial viability of the Concession, but the Claimant has been unable to convince the Tribunal of the correctness of its understanding of the terms of the Law and the Concession Agreement.\n\n322.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal finds that the impact on the investment attributable to the Province's actions was not to the extent required to find that, in the aggregate, these actions amounted to an expropriation; Azurix did not lose the attributes of ownership, at all times continued to control ABA and its ownership of 90% of the shares was unaffected. No doubt the management of ABA was affected by the Province's actions, but not sufficiently for the Tribunal to find that Azurix's investment was expropriated.\n\n323.\n\nThe Tribunal will turn now to whether the other standards of protection in the BIT were violated as claimed by Azurix. The Tribunal has grouped the arguments made under the heading of \"Transparency\" under \"Fair and Equitable Treatment.\"\n\n**2. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n324.\n\nAzurix first refers to Article II(2)(a) of the BIT which provides that \"[i]nvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment,\u2026and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than required by international law.\" The BIT emphasizes this treatment by including it in the preamble: \"agreeing that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective use of economic resources\u2026\" Azurix notes that the BIT does not include a definition of the phrase \"fair and equitable\" and that its meaning revolves on whether it means the minimum standard required by international law or whether \"the phrase represents an independent, self-contained principle, which must be given its \u2018plain meaning' pursuant to the general principle for interpreting treaties in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention.\"263\n\nMemorial, p. 181.\n\n325.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, on the basis of the text of Article II(2)(a), doctrine and case law, the phrase in question does not refer to the minimum standard. In particular, the Claimant relies on the opinion of F.A. Mann:\n\n\"[t]he terms \u2018fair and equitable treatment' envisage conduct which goes far beyond the minimum standard and afford protection to a greater extent and according to a much more objective standard that any previously employed form of words. A tribunal would not be concerned with a minimum, maximum or average standard. It will have to decide whether in all the circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable. No standard defined by other words is likely to be material. The terms are to be understood and applied independently and autonomously.\"264\n\nF.A. Mann, \"*British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments*,\" 52 Brit. & B. International Law (1982) p. 244. Quoted in the Memorial, p. 181.\n\n326.\n\nThe Claimant analyzes the text of the provision and considers that the comma separating the phrase of fair and equitable treatment from the treatment required by international law would seem to indicate a sequence of standards and, \"strongly suggests that the latter is intended to be a self-contained standard independent of the former. Moreover, the introductory phrase, \u2018in no case \u2026 less than that required by international law\u2018, appears to establish the international law standard as the minimum standard against which, *ipso facto*, the \u2018fair and equitable treatment' standard must be deemed a higher, more rigorous standard.\"265\n\nMemorial, p. 182.\n\n327.\n\nThe Claimant notes that a position paper of UNCTAD on the meaning of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\" reaches the conclusion that \"[t]hese considerations point ultimately towards fair and equitable treatment not being synonymous with the international minimum standard.\"266\n\nUNCTAD, \"*Fair and Equitable Treatment*,\" No. E. 99, II.D.15 (1999) Quoted in the Memorial, p. 182.\n\n328.\n\nThe Claimant refers to *Pope & Talbot*, and to the fact that the tribunal in that case relied on Mann's article and UNCTAD's paper extensively in its reasoning. That tribunal held that the standard under NAFTA was different from the minimum international law requirement and considered that \"compliance with the fairness elements must be ascertained free of any threshold that might be applicable to the evaluation of measures under the minimum standard of international law\". The tribunal rejected that the State's conduct needed to be egregious, outrageous, shocking or otherwise extraordinary, which is the standard applied in *Neer*.267\n\nMemorial, pp.182-183.\n\n329.\n\nThe Claimant also refers to the plain meaning of fair and equitable. Fair means impartial, honest, free from prejudice, favoritism and self interest, equitable is just, conformable to the principles of justice and right.\n\n330.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Argentina breached this standard because as it occurred in *Pope & Talbot*,\n\n\"Azurix's Investment was subjected by the Province to refusals to provide necessary information (DPTC records), indefinite delays in verifying information and taking decisions (Resolution 7/00, property improvements and ABA's proposal for equivalence of Valuations 1958), assertions of non-existent policy reasons and requests for unnecessary information (cost study for RPI adjustment), manipulation of contract language while ignoring express representations during the contracting process (Resolution 1/99 and Information Communiqu\u00e9 No. 12), changes of position (Canon), public vilification and administrative fines for actions for which the Province was responsible (Circular 31(A) Works), and threats of criminal action against ABA's directors.\"268\n\nIbid., p. 190.\n\n331.\n\nAll this occurred, according to the Claimant, because the Province needed money to balance its budget deficit and was unwilling to allow water increases because it would be a political problem for the new administration.269\n\nIbid., p. 191.\n\n332.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, Argentina disagrees on the meaning of fair and equitable, which it considers inextricably attached to the international minimum standard, on the controversial appreciation of the facts, which do not constitute a violation of the standard, and on the autonomous characterization of the standard.\n\n333.\n\nArgentina argues that there are very few awards and authors that postulate the assertion that the standard of fair and equitable treatment is different from the minimum international standard. Based on the findings of the tribunals in *Genin*, *Azinian*, and *S.D. Myers*, Argentina considers that the meaning of this standard is \"related to the purpose of providing a basic and general principle\", \"constitutes a minimum international standard\", and \"for it to be violated it is necessary that the State receiving the investment incur in acts that demonstrate a premeditated intent to not comply with an obligation, insufficient action falling below international standards or even subjective bad faith.\"270 The Respondent emphasizes that in *Myers* the tribunal stated that Article 1105(1) of the NAFTA imposes \"fair treatment at a level acceptable to the international community, measured with the highest degree of deference towards domestic authorities.\" Thus, \"[o]nly the reasonableness of the measure claimed to be grievous must be measured, and this, with deference.\"271\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 981.\n\nIbid., para. 987. Emphasis added by the Respondent.\n\n334.\n\nArgentina expresses its agreement with the binding interpretation of Article 1105(1) of NAFTA by the Free Trade Commission (\"FTC\"). The FTC interpreted the article as follows:\n\n\"1. Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party.\n\n2. The concepts of \u2018fair and equitable treatment\u2019 and \u2018full protection and security\u2019 do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.\n\n3. A determination that there has been breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).\"\n\n335.\n\nThe Respondent also manifests its agreement with the provision of Article 10.4 of the Free Trade Agreement between the United States of America and Chile which in reference to \"fair and equitable treatment\" and \"full protection and security\" \"does not require treatment in addition or beyond that which is required by that standard and does not create additional substantive rights.\"272\n\nIbid., para. 993.\n\n336.\n\nThe Respondent denies the contention of Azurix that this standard would refer to the expectations of the investor not being frustrated by legislation, rules and regulations and adduces as reasons for casting aside this conception that, \"Fairness and equitableness may require (not merely allow) the amendment of a legal system. Such would be the case if, for example, the beneficiary of such legal system is causing harm to others. This is frequently true in environmental and health matters...thus violating the fundamental juristic principle forbidding causing harm.\" The Respondent argues that, \"Any acceptable concept of what constitutes \u2018property\u2019 incorporates as property rights the expectations based on the legal system that begets them. Therefore, in the event of changes to such system (or of the property rights or of the vested rights), the aggrieved party is faced not with unfair treatment but rather with an alleged expropriatory treatment. The legitimate expectations, as part of any reasonable concept of property, are protected by a different standard.\"273\n\nIbid., para. 985.\n\n337.\n\nArgentina questions the facts on which the alleged breach of this standard is claimed by Azurix. Referring to the list of expectations reproduced early here, Argentina qualifies them as rash or extremely vague or semantic labels rather than description of the facts.274 Argentina argues that, in terms of the standard proposed, Argentina cannot be held responsible for a breach of the BIT nor can it be held to have breached it even under the standard proposed by Azurix. Neither the Province nor Argentina departed from applicable legislation, rules and regulations.\n\nIbid. para. 998.\n\n338.\n\nArgentina disagrees with the autonomous categorization of unfair and inequitable acts. The facts, measures, events, acts and omissions described by the Claimant in violation of the fair and equitable standard are the same as those alleged to be expropriatory, \"[s]uch is the extent of this identification that when it comes to claiming a compensation only the expropriation of the investment is taken into account.\"275\n\nIbid., para 1000.\n\n339.\n\nArgentina maintains that the events or acts that qualify as expropriation cannot be the same as those that qualify as unfair and inequitable treatment. Depending on their legal qualification, facts produce different legal consequences. According to Argentina, \u2019\u2019confusion between expropriatory acts and acts constituting unfair treatment renders one of the two claims invalid.\"276 Argentina then contests the supposed strategy of Azurix to pursue the two claims so that if the Tribunal would not consider the measures expropriatory then they could be considered as constituting unfair and inequitable treatment with a claim to the same compensation. Argentina questions that this could be the case,\n\n\"unfair treatment can never be characterized as the loss of a property right because that is precisely the core of an expropriation \u2026 The unfair treatment should generate some other form of damage, a detrimental consequence other than the alleged loss of property rights. It should be a consequence as independent from the expropriation damage consequence as the acts that trigger the application of this second standard are (or ought to be) independent and autonomous of the events that caused the application (or non-application) of the first standard.\"277\n\nIbid., para. 1004.\n\nIbid., para. 1006.\n\n340.\n\nArgentina supports further its argument by referring to *Azinian.* In that case, the claimant had alleged violations of Articles 1110 and 1105 of NAFTA. The tribunal reasoned that,\n\n\"The only conceivably relevant substantive principle of Article 1105 is that a NAFTA investor should not be dealt with in a manner that contravenes international law. There has not been a claim of such a violation of international law other than the one more specifically covered by Article 1110. In a feeble attempt to maintain Article 1105, the Claimants\u2019 Reply Memorial affirms that the breach of the Concession Contract violated international law because it was \u2018motivated by non-commercial considerations, and compensatory damages were not paid.\u2019 This is but a paraphrase of a complaint more specifically covered by Article 1110. For the avoidance of doubt, the Arbitral Tribunal therefore holds that under the circumstances of this case if there was no violation of Article 1110, there was none of Article 1105.\"\n\nArgentina considers that the same reasoning applies to the instant case.\n\n341.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant alleges that the interpretation of Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT by the Respondent is erroneous. According to the Claimant, the basic touchstone of fair and equitable treatment is to be found in the legitimate and reasonable expectations of the parties. The Claimant considers that, as recommended by Jan Paulsson, the Tribunal should examine \"the impact of the measure on the reasonable investment backed-expectations of the investor, and whether the state is attempting to avoid investment-backed expectations that the state created or reinforced through its own acts.\"278 The Claimant finds support for this view in *Tecmed* where the tribunal held that fair and equitable treatment requires treatment by the Contracting Parties \"that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment.\"279\n\nReply, quote in para. 685.\n\nIbid.\n\n342.\n\nThe Claimant argues that this standard encompasses more specific standards recognized by international tribunals the breach of which entails the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, such as that a government will obey its own laws and customary international law, will act honestly, transparently, consistently with representations made and in good faith. As part of good faith, according to the Claimant, the State's rights must be exercised reasonably and within the limits of international law, domestic law and the contract, otherwise it incurs in abuse of those rights.280\n\nIbid., paras. 687-693.\n\n343.\n\nThe Claimant questions the interpretation of ICSID awards by the Respondent. According to the Claimant, in *Genin* the tribunal did not attempt to develop a comprehensive definition of the meaning of fair and equitable treatment, as opposed, for instance, to the full analysis provided in *Tecmed*. The standard in NAFTA is different from the standard in the BIT. Article 1105(1) of NAFTA states that investments must be provided \"treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security\" (emphasis added by the Claimant). This text differs from the corresponding provision of the BIT in the way \"international law\" and \"fair and equitable treatment\" are connected. For the Claimant, it is evident that, under the BIT, \"fair and equitable treatment\" is \"a separate requirement and additional requirement from the international law standard, and that international law sets a floor, indicating that 'fair and equitable treatment' requires something different from and more, but never less, than international law.\"281\n\nIbid., para. 699.\n\n344.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, even in *S.D. Myers* the tribunal did not say what the Respondent pretends. The tribunal held that the standard is breached when \"an investor has been treated in such an unjust or arbitrary manner that the treatment rises to the level that is unacceptable from the international perspective.\" That tribunal concluded that Canada had acted in a discriminatory manner and had breached Article 1102, and such breach also entailed a breach of the fair and equitable standard provided in Article 1105.282\n\nIbid., para. 701.\n\n345.\n\nThe Claimant observes that the minimum standard argument of the Respondent is based on the standard set in *Neer* in the 1920s and that the standard has evolved as pointed out in *Mondev.* The minimum standard today cannot be limited to the content of customary international law as recognized in arbitral decisions in the 1920s; what is unfair or inequitable to today\u2019s eye need not equate with the outrageous or egregious. In that tribunal\u2019s view: \"there can be no doubt that, by interpreting Article 1105(1) to prescribe the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of another Party under NAFTA, the term \"customary international law\" refers to customary international law as it stood no earlier than the time at which NAFTA came into force.\" The customary international law standard is defined by the ordinary meaning of the terms \"fair and equitable\".283*Tecmed,* on the other hand, maintains that this standard requires the contracting parties \"to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment.\"284\n\nIbid., para. 703.\n\n*Tecmed,* para. 154, quoted in the Reply, para. 705.\n\n346.\n\nThen the Claimant turns to the Respondent\u2019s contention that Azurix\u2019s confuses the meaning of expropriatory acts and acts constituting unfair and inequitable treatment. The Claimant argues that the BIT provides rights that are independent from each other and the breach of any one of them would entitle the investor to resort to the dispute settlement procedure provided by the BIT and would give rise to a right to compensation for the economic harm sustained. What are independent are the rights under the BIT not necessarily the measures that have breached those rights.285\n\nReply, paras. 715-718.\n\n347.\n\nThe Claimant addresses the question of which losses suffered by Azurix could be attributed to unfair and inequitable treatment and which to expropriation. According to the Claimant, unfair and inequitable treatment does not generate a different form of damage. The real question that Argentina is raising is whether Azurix is claiming double recovery. The Claimant affirms that this is not the case. Azurix is entitled to recover its full damages, but only once. The Claimant quotes from *S.D. Myers* on the cumulative nature of the rights and remedies under BITs:\n\n\"When both Article 1102 and 1105 have been breached, as the Tribunal has found in this case, the usual principle to be applied is that rights and remedies under trade agreements are cumulative unless there is actual conflict between different provisions. The fact that a host Party has breached both Article 1102 and Article 1105 cannot be taken to mean that the investor is entitled to less compensation than if only Article 1103 were breached. A host Party does not reduce the extent of its liability by breaching more than one provision of the NAFTA.\"286\n\nIbid., paras. 715-722.\n\n348.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it has provided the Tribunal a discrete damage evaluation that identifies which damages were caused by each of the measures. This should be sufficient to answer Argentina's question. As regards the Respondent's question about the causal relationship between an unfair act and the damage that the expropriatory is alleged to have caused, the Claimant considers that this concern has become meaningless once it has been shown that the same measure may breach more than one right under the BIT and the analysis of damages presented by Azurix allows the Tribunal to identify the impact caused by each measure of Argentina.287\n\nIbid., paras. 723-725.\n\n349.\n\nThe Claimant observes that the Respondent qualifies Azurix's claims as rash and states that they are not independent and cannot be analyzed, but it does not explain the reasons for these statements. The Claimant alleges that Argentina is wrong on both counts and lists in non-exhaustive form the ways in which the Province frustrated Azurix's expectations by not allowing to charge tariffs in accordance with the Concession Agreement, by repudiation of Circular 52(A), by refusing to accept ABA's termination of the Concession, by refusal to return the non-amortized portion of the investments, by not allowing ABA to collect the receivables, by requiring that ABA continue to operate the service for more than 90 days, by imposing arbitrary penalties, by politicizing the tariff regime, by publicly calling on customers not to pay their bills, by provoking the illegal intervention of the Provincial Domestic Trade Bureau to enjoin ABA from billing for its services.288\n\nIbid., paras. 725-727.\n\n350.\n\nIn the Rejoinder, the Respondent points out that it never referred to *Neer* in the Counter-Memorial, and contests the interpretation given by the Claimant to *Tecmed*. According to the Respondent, *Tecmed* and *Genin* arrive to the same conclusion. The Mexican authorities had engaged in conduct that was notoriously unfair. This was not the case of ABA's treatment, which was never a cooperative investor and had breached the Concession Agreement. *Tecmed* supports the Argentine position because it distinguishes between \"the object of protection (that could be legitimate expectations, good faith and transparency) from the level of protection granted by the Treaty\". The Respondent emphasizes that its own concept of fair and equitable permits to differentiate between standards rather than collapse them. The Respondent notes that the Reply does not change the fact that NAFTA tribunals apply a minimum standard defined more recently in *Waste Management* :\n\n\"\u2026despite certain differences in emphasis, a general standard for Article 1105 arises. Taken together, cases *S.D. Myers, Mondev, ADF* and *Loewen* suggest that the minimum standard of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes claimant to sectional or racial prejudice or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety- as may be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"289\n\nRejoinder, quote in para. 1077.\n\n351.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that this is the standard applied in NAFTA, which delimits the level of violation from the object of the protection, and the scope that the Claimant gives to the standard would make irrelevant all the standards of protection because it would encompass them all.290\n\nIbid., paras. 1078 and 1080.\n\n352.\n\nAs regards Article II(7) of the BIT, the Claimant has argued that the Respondent breached its duty of transparency under this article. The Claimant points out that Article II(7) of the BIT requires that \"each Party shall make public all laws, regulations, administrative practices and procedures, and adjudicatory decisions that pertain to or affect investments.\" This requirement prevents States, according to the Claimant, from imposing undisclosed laws, regulations or practices that adversely affect investments. The Claimant refers to how the tribunal in *Metalclad* understood a similar provision in NAFTA. That tribunal understood the concept of transparency \"to include the idea that all relevant legal requirements for the purpose of initiating, completing and successfully operating investments made, or intended to be made, under the [NAFTA] should be capable of being readily known to all affected investors of another Party. There should be no room for doubt or uncertainty on such matters.\"291 The Claimant argues that the transparency provision under the BIT is reinforced by the requirement of a transparent regulatory environment under the Law and the Concession Agreement. Specifically, the ORAB never made public its \"regulations, administrative practices and procedures\". The Concession Agreement requires the ORAB to rule on any proposals for tariff adjustment within the period set in the \"procedural regulation\". If such regulation had been issued, compliance with it would have prevented the dilatory tactics that compromised the tariff regime.292\n\nMemorial, p. 216.\n\nIbid., pp. 216-217.\n\n353.\n\nThe Claimant observes that the ORAB was established as an autonomous entity under the Law and had exclusive authority to supervise the Concession. Regardless of this fact, the decisions of the ORAB were controlled and dictated by the MOSP. To this allegedly improper influence, the Claimant attributes the request of the RPI study and other instances may be established circumstantially:\n\n\"because the ORAB candidly told ABA that, although they believed it was correct in its position on Resolution 1/99, they could not undo it because of political pressures. This is confirmed by the statements to ABA by Minister Romero and Undersecretary Garc\u00eda about the political problems created by increased water bills. And in fact (based on Minister's Romero's comments) newspapers reported that the ORAB would issue a resolution forcing withdrawal of the bills before the ORAB ever met to issue Resolution 1/99. Similarly, the ORAB President told ABA the ORAB could not grant the RPI adjustment because of political pressure from the MOSP, and ORAB directors said the Bah\u00eda Blanca 'crisis' was not ABA's fault, but when the Governor and the MOSP Minister publicly attacked ABA, the ORAB also took actions against the company. These actions are consistent with the Governor's pronouncement to Azurix and ABA.\"293\n\nIbid., p. 217.\n\n354.\n\nThe Minister also admitted before the provincial House of Representatives that there was still a great lack of transparency on the regulation of the concessionaires:\n\n\"The other element we consider worth mentioning is Resolution 16 under which controlling entities are to make public all their decisions. This is a point we should like to emphasize since we consider there used to be a great lack of transparency \u2013 and there still is \u2013 on the control of companies under concessions in Argentina\".294\n\nQuoted in the Memorial, p. 216.\n\n355.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent considered that the *Metalclad* case was not relevant because of the different circumstances of that case which concerned a regulatory conflict between different jurisdictions of a Federal State.295\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 1049.\n\n356.\n\nAzurix insists in its Reply that the case is analogous to the instant case and provides useful guidance on the application of the transparency standard: \"the facts of the present case are more compelling than *Metalclad* since the BIT explicitly requires that '[e]ach party shall make public all\u2026administrative practices and procedures [\u2026],' and the Province indisputably failed to do so.\"296 The Claimant also observes that this standard has been applied by other tribunals besides in *Metalcald*. In *Maffezini* the tribunal held that the lack of transparency in a loan transaction was incompatible with Spain's commitment to ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investor, and in *Tecmed* the tribunal found that the State had an obligation in applying the fair and equitable treatment standard to act 'totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor\u2026'\"297\n\nReply, para. 756.\n\nIbid., para. 757.\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondent, in the Rejoinder, simply affirms its previous defense, and points out its surprise that the Province is accused of lack of transparency when it was Azurix and ABA \"who after being in charge of the Service provision, pretended to make an attempt against the terms of the Contract that they had known and accepted.\"298\n\nRejoinder, para. 1087.\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n358.\n\nThe arguments exchanged by the parties raise the following issues:\n\n1. Whether the standard of fair and equitable treatment is a standard which entails obligations for the parties to the BIT in the treatment of foreign investment which are additional to those required by the minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law;\n\n2. What conduct attributable to the State can be characterized as unfair and inequitable? In other words, what is the substantive content of the standard?; and\n\n3. Whether Article II(7) of the BIT has been breached.\n\n359.\n\nIn discussing the first issue, the Tribunal will start by considering the specific provision of the BIT on fair and equitable treatment and recall that the BIT is an international treaty that should be interpreted in accordance with the norms of interpretation established by the Vienna Convention. As already noted, the Vienna Convention is binding on the parties to the BIT. Article 31(1) of the Convention requires that a treaty be \"interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\".\n\n360.\n\nIn their ordinary meaning, the terms \"fair\" and \"equitable\" used in Article 3(1) of the BIT mean \"just\", \"even-handed\", \"unbiased\", \"legitimate.\"299 As regards the purpose and object of the BIT, in its Preamble, the parties state their desire to promote greater cooperation with respect to investment, recognize that \"agreement upon the treatment to be accorded such investment will stimulate the flow of private capital and the economic development of the Parties\", and agree that \"fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable in order to maintain a stable framework for investment and maximum effective use of economic resources.\" It follows from the ordinary meaning of the terms fair and equitable and the purpose and object of the BIT that fair and equitable should be understood to be treatment in an even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment. The text of the BIT reflects a positive attitude towards investment with words such as \"promote\" and \"stimulate\". Furthermore, the parties to the BIT recognize the role that fair and equitable treatment plays in maintaining \"a stable framework for investment and maximum effective use of economic resources.\"\n\n*Oxford English Dictionary*. These terms are similarly defined in *Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola*, 22nd edition at www.rae.es.\n\n361.\n\nTurning now to Article II.2(a), this paragraph provides: \"Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than required by international law.\" The paragraph consists of three full statements, each listing in sequence a standard of treatment to be accorded to investments: fair and equitable, full protection and security, not less than required by international law. Fair and equitable treatment is listed separately. The last sentence ensures that, whichever content is attributed to the other two standards, the treatment accorded to investment will be no less than required by international law. The clause, as drafted, permits to interpret fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security as higher standards than required by international law. The purpose of the third sentence is to set a floor, not a ceiling, in order to avoid a possible interpretation of these standards below what is required by international law. While this conclusion results from the textual analysis of this provision, the Tribunal does not consider that it is of material significance for its application of the standard of fair and equitable treatment to the facts of the case. As it will be explained below, the minimum requirement to satisfy this standard has evolved and the Tribunal considers that its content is substantially similar whether the terms are interpreted in their ordinary meaning, as required by the Vienna Convention, or in accordance with customary international law.300\n\nSee *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A.* v. *The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), para. 155.\n\n362.\n\nArgentina has declared its agreement with the interpretation of Article 1105 of NAFTA by the \"FTC. This article bears the heading of the \"Minimum Standard of Treatment\". Paragraph 1 reads as follows: \"Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.\" In this provision, the standards of fair and equitable and full protection and security are defined as part of the treatment in accordance with international law. As interpreted by the FTC, the standard of treatment, and as indicated in the title of the article, is the minimum required under customary international law.\n\n363.\n\nArgentina has also drawn the attention of the Tribunal to recent Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) entered by the United States, such as the Free Trade Agreement with Chile, where the minimum treatment required is that required under international law. The interpretation of the FTC or the examples of FTAs adduced by the Respondent may be evidence of a significant practice by one of the parties to the BIT, but the Tribunal has difficulty in reading it in the text of the BIT which governs these proceedings. The fact that the FTC interpreted Article 1105 in reaction to a tribunal's different understanding of this article and that, in recent agreements, the correlative clause has been drafted to reflect the FTC's interpretation show that the meaning of that article and similar clauses in other agreements could reasonably be understood to have a different meaning.\n\n364.\n\nThe question whether fair and equitable treatment is or is not additional to the minimum treatment requirement under international law is a question about the substantive content of fair and equitable treatment and, whichever side of the argument one takes, the answer to the question may in substance be the same.\n\n365.\n\nIn 1927, the US-Mexican Mixed Claims Commission considered in the *Neer* case that a State has breached the fair and equitable treatment obligation when the conduct of the State could be described as outrageous, egregious or in bad faith or so below international standards that a reasonable and impartial person would easily recognize it as such. This description of conduct in breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard has been considered as the expression of customary international law at that time. In deciding the determinant elements of fair and equitable treatment, the question for the Tribunal is whether, at the time the BIT was concluded, customary international law had evolved to a higher standard of treatment.\n\n366.\n\nThe parties have interpreted differently how arbitral tribunals have understood this standard. We will turn to the cases discussed. Argentina has placed particular emphasis on *Genin*. In that case, the tribunal had to decide on whether the investor had been treated fairly and equitably in the context of the revocation of a banking license. The tribunal found no breach of the standard because there were ample grounds for the action taken by the Bank of Estonia. The tribunal in considering the meaning of fair and equitable did not engage in a textual analysis of the fair and equitable treatment clause in the US-Estonia BIT but simply referred to how this requirement has been generally understood under international law, namely, an international minimum standard separate from domestic law but \"that is, indeed, a minimum standard.\"301 According to the same tribunal, for State conduct to breach such standard, it would need to reflect \"a willful neglect of duty, an insufficiency of action falling far below international standards, or even subjective bad faith.\"302\n\nPara. 367.\n\nIbid.\n\n367.\n\nNotwithstanding the finding that, in the circumstances of the case, Estonia did not breach the duty of fair and equitable treatment, the tribunal seems to have been uneasy about letting the conduct of Estonia stand without criticism and considered it necessary to express the hope that \"Bank of Estonia will exercise its regulatory and supervisory functions with greater caution regarding procedure in the future.\"303 In considering the award of costs, the same tribunal noted that \"the awkward manner by which the Bank of Estonia revoked EIB's license, and in particular the lack of prior notice of its intention to revoke EIB's license and of any means for EIB or its shareholders to challenge that decision prior to its being formalized, cannot escape censure.\"304\n\nIbid., para. 372.\n\nIbid., para. 381.\n\n368.\n\nArbitral tribunals under NAFTA have found, after the interpretation of the FTC, that the customary international law to be applied is the customary international law as it stood in 1994 not in 1927. In *Mondev,* the tribunal considered that \"the content of the minimum standard today cannot be limited to the content of customary international law as recognized in arbitral decisions in the 1920s.\"305 The tribunal noted that the parties in that case agreed that the international standard of treatment has evolved as all customary international law had evolved, and that the two other State parties to NAFTA also agreed with this point.306 Therefore, the customary international law to be applied \"is not limited to the international law of the 19th century or even of the first half of the 20th century, although decisions from that period remain relevant. In holding that Article 1105(1) refers to customary international law, the FTC interpretations incorporate current international law, content, the content of which is shaped by the conclusion of more than two thousand bilateral investment treaties and many treaties of friendship and commerce. Those treaties largely and concordantly provide for 'fair and equitable\u2019 treatment of and, and for 'full protection and security\u2019 for, the foreign investor and his investments.\"307 Applying this evolutionary concept to customary international law, the tribunal found that \"To the modern eye, what is unfair or inequitable need not equate with the outrageous or the egregious. In particular, a State may treat foreign investment unfairly and inequitably without necessarily acting in bad faith.\"308\n\n*Mondev International Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/2), Award of October 11,2002, para. 123.\n\nIbid., para. 124.\n\nIbid., para. 125.\n\nIbid., para.116. The tribunal in *ADF* affirmed the same point: \"what customary international law projects is not a static photograph of the minimum standard of treatment of aliens as it stood in 1927 when the Award in the *Neer* case was rendered. For both customary international law and the minimum standard of treatment of aliens it incorporates, are constantly in a process of development.\" *ADF Group, Inc. v. USA,* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/1) Award of January 9, 2003, para.179.\n\n369.\n\nThe tribunal in *Loewen* came to a similar conclusion: \"Neither State practice, the decisions of international tribunals nor the opinion of commentators support the view that bad faith or malicious intention is an essential element of unfair and inequitable treatment or denial of justice amounting to a breach of international justice.\"309\n\n*The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L. Loewen v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)98/3), Award of June 26, 2003, para. 132.\n\n370.\n\nAfter an analysis of arbitral decisions and awards under NAFTA, the tribunal in *Waste Management* reached the conclusion that:\n\n\"the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the state and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety \u2013 as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candor in an administrative process. In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.\"310\n\n*Waste Management, Inc. v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/3) Award of 30 April 2004, para. 98.\n\n371.\n\nThe parties have also referred to *Tecmed*, which describes just and equitable treatment as requiring:\n\n\"the Contracting Parties to provide to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment and comply with such regulations.\"311\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A.* v. *The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), para. 154. Unofficial translation from the Spanish original published by ICSID on its web site.\n\n372.\n\nExcept for *Genin,* there is a common thread in the recent awards under NAFTA and *Tecmed* which does not require bad faith or malicious intention of the recipient State as a necessary element in the failure to treat investment fairly and equitably. As recently stated in *CMS,* it is an objective standard \"unrelated to whether the Respondent has had any deliberate intention or bad faith in adopting the measures in question. Of course, such intention and bad faith can aggravate the situation but are not an essential element of the standard.\"312 It is also understood that the conduct of the State has to be below international standards but those are not at the level of 1927. A third element is the frustration of expectations that the investor may have legitimately taken into account when it made the investment. The standards of conduct agreed by the parties to a BIT presuppose a favorable disposition towards foreign investment, in fact, a pro-active behavior of the State to encourage and protect it. To encourage and protect investment is the purpose of the BIT. It would be incoherent with such purpose and the expectations created by such a document to consider that a party to the BIT has breached the obligation of fair and equitable treatment only when it has acted in bad faith or its conduct can be qualified as outrageous or egregious.\n\n*CMS Gas Transportation Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8) Award of May 12, 2005, para. 280.\n\n373.\n\nBased on these considerations, the Tribunal will now turn to whether the Respondent breached its obligation to treat the Claimant\u2019s investment fairly and equitably. To this effect, the Tribunal considers the instances described below to be particularly relevant:\n\n374.\n\nThe Tribunal is struck by the conduct of the Province after the Claimant gave notice of termination of the Concession Agreement. ABA had requested to terminate it in agreement with the Province. The Province refused what was a reasonable request in light of the previous behavior of the Province and its agencies. The refusal by the Province to accept that notice of termination and its insistence on terminating it by itself on account of abandonment of the Concession is a clear case of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. It is evident from the facts before this Tribunal that the Concession was not abandoned.\n\n375.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal has rejected to a certain extent the interpretations of the Concession Agreement and the Law alleged by the Claimant regarding the RPI and the Canon, it is also clear that the tariff regime was politicized because of concerns with forthcoming elections or because the Concession was awarded by the previous government. The issues of the zoning coefficients and the construction variations are cases in point. It is significant that, once the service was transferred, the new service provider was allowed to raise tariffs reflecting the construction variations.\n\n376.\n\nFinally, the repeated calls of the Provincial governor and other officials for non-payment of bills by customers verges on bad faith in the case of the Bah\u00eda Blanca incident when the Province itself had not completed the works that would have helped to avoid the problem in the first place.\n\n377.\n\nConsidered together, these actions reflect a pervasive conduct of the Province in breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n378.\n\nIt remains to be considered whether Argentina also breached Article II(7) of the Treaty. Azurix bases its claim on the fact that ORAB never published its regulations and lacked independence. Article II(7) requires publication of the laws, regulations, adjudicatory decisions and administrative practices and procedures pertaining or affecting investments. The Tribunal has already found that the politicization of the Concession is an element in the Tribunal's determination that the fair and equitable standard has been breached. On the other hand, the Tribunal has also found that ORAB's request for a study in the context of the RPI was a legitimate request. The Tribunal considers that, in view of the facts, what is at issue here is the conduct in the application of the regulatory framework rather than its publicity. There is no doubt that publication of ORAB's regulations would have been a desirable improvement, but the lack of it as argued by the Claimant is not sufficient to conclude that Article II(7) has been breached.\n\n**3. Failure to Observe Obligations**\n-------------------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n379.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant argues that the Province and the Republic have failed to observe their obligations as required by Article II(2)(c) of the BIT: \"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments.\" The Claimant refers to the fact that Article XIII of the BIT extends its application to the political subdivisions of the Respondent and concludes from it that the BIT imposes an obligation directly on the Province to observe its obligations to foreign investors.313\n\nMemorial, p. 192.\n\n380.\n\nIn the Counter-Memorial, Argentina contends that contractual claims do not become automatically treaty claims, and that no tribunal has accepted such an argument. Furthermore, Azurix and ABA specifically renounced to raise contractual issues before an ICSID tribunal, and Article II(2)(c) of the BIT refers to obligations undertaken towards specific investment agreements and not to concession contracts governed by domestic administrative law. Argentina also observes that the Claimant has failed to prove the existence of a cause and effect link between the event and the loss and to povide a precise assessment of the losses. Argentina concludes its argument by affirming that it had not undertaken any contractual obligation whatsoever with Azurix and the same is true of the Province.314\n\nCounter-Memorial, paras. 1009-1015.\n\n381.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant notes that Article II(2)(c) refers to \"any obligation\", it includes obligations arising under international law and under municipal law; it is not limited to breaches of international agreements, which in any case is a term that would include concession agreements. The Claimant alleges that \"To limit this BIT provision to any one category of obligations would require that limiting language be read into the treaty, something the drafters could have done but intentionally chose not to do. The Tribunal's task, of course, is to construe the treaty as written, not rewrite it as the GOA would prefer.\" Any uncertainties should be interpreted in favor of the investor given the objectives of the BIT as expressed in its preamble.315\n\nReply, para. 732.\n\n382.\n\nAzurix adds that the phrase \"entered into\" is not limited to any particular mode or method and encompasses obligations undertaken through contract, legislation, decrees, resolutions or regulations. Moreover, the BIT does not limit the application of this clause to a specific investment as claimed by the Respondent, Article II(2)(c) refers to obligations in respect of investments in plural and generically. As regards the issue of the forum for contractual disputes provided for in the Concession Agreement, the Claimant argues that Article VII(2) of the BIT is very clear in giving a choice to the private party concerned between submitting the dispute to the forum previously agreed or international arbitration. Azurix re-affirms that it had already proved that damages had occurred during the Concession and were continuing annually as a result of the Province's breaches.316\n\nIbid., paras. 729-737.\n\n383.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, Argentina recalls the findings of the PCIJ in *Serbian Loans*, the ICJ in *ELSI*, the arbitral tribunal in *Woodruff*, the Ad hoc Annulment Committee in *Vivendi*, and the arbitral tribunals in the *SGS* cases, and concludes that general international law bluntly separates contractual claims from those under international law, that even in the case of BITs the prohibition to transubstantiate a contractual claim into a BIT claim remains, and that when a tribunal has established conditions for the application of an umbrella clause it has required the claimant to abide by the contract forum clause.317\n\nRejoinder, para. 987.\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nAs already stated by the Tribunal in affirming its jurisdiction within the limits permitted by the Convention and the BIT, the Tribunal finds that none of the contractual claims as such refer to a contract between the parties to these proceedings; neither the Province nor ABA are parties to them. While Azurix may submit a claim under the BIT for breaches by Argentina, there is no undertaking to be honored by Argentina to Azurix other than the obligations under the BIT. Even if for argument's sake, it would be possible under Article II(2)(c) to hold Argentina responsible for the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement by the Province, it was ABA and not Azurix which was the party to this Agreement.\n\n**4. Arbitrary Measures**\n-------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimant argues that arbitrary or discriminatory measures are listed as alternatives in the BIT and, therefore, it is sufficient that a measure be arbitrary to constitute a breach of the BIT. In its ordinary meaning arbitrary means \"a characterization of a decision or action taken by an administrative agency\u2026 [as] willful and unreasonable action and without consideration or in disregard of facts or law or without determining principle.\"318 The Claimant also refers to the definition of arbitrary by the ICJ in *ELSI*, \"Arbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as something opposed to the rule of law\u2026 It is willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety.\" The Claimant observes that this definition is too narrow and does not accord with the ordinary meaning of arbitrariness. The Claimant refers to *Pope & Talbot* and its comments on the evolution of international law, as characterized by the ICJ decision, that moves away from the *Neer* formulation. According to that tribunal, the formulation in *ELSI* :\n\n\"leaves out any requirement that *every* reasonable and impartial person be dissatisfied and perhaps permits a bit less injury to the psyche of the observer, who need no longer be outraged, but only surprised by what the government has done. And, of course, replacing the neutral 'governmental action', with the concept of 'due process' perforce makes the formulation more dynamic and responsive to evolving and more vigorous standards for evaluating what governments do to people and companies.\"319\n\nMemorial, p. 217.\n\nIbid, p. 208.\n\n386.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that to determine whether an action is or not arbitrary in its ordinary meaning should meet four tests: it should be taken by the proper authority, for the proper purpose, because of relevant circumstances and should not be patently unreasonable. In accordance with these tests, the measures taken by the Province were arbitrary. Resolution 1/99 was issued for an improper purpose, the tariff regime was improperly applied, the issues related to Circular 58(A) were not dealt within reasonable periods of time, the RPI was denied for irrelevant reasons, the Province induced a high bid price with Circular 52(A) and then claimed that the bidder paid too much and it could not be fully included in the base rate. The Province acted according to the electoral needs of its officials rather than in accordance with the rule of law.320\n\nIbid, p. 211.\n\n387.\n\nThe Respondent considers that the definition in *ELSI* is the most appropriate. Argentina contests the relevance of *Pope & Talbot,* which was referring to the concept of fair and equitable treatment not to a definition of discriminatory measures.. The Respondent points out that, in *Genin,* the tribunal held that \"in order to amount to a violation of the BIT, any procedural irregularity that may have been present would have to amount to bad faith, a willful disregard of due process of law or an extreme insufficiency of action.\"321\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 1024.\n\n388.\n\nIn its Reply, the Claimant insists that the meaning in the BIT should be the ordinary meaning of its terms. Article 11.2(b) uses the most general of terms, \"in any way\" either party shall \"impair\" the management, operation, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investment.\" The verb \"impair\" means \"to diminish, lessen, damage, deteriorate, or make worse.\" From this the Claimant concludes that the terms used \"indicate that the prohibition is to be applied broadly to any conduct that directly or indirectly achieves the prohibited result.\"322 If the drafters would have wished to limit the import of arbitrary measures to meaning a violation of the rule of law, they could have said it in no uncertain terms, directly and without bothering to draft the clause \"with such precision and detail.\"323\n\nReply, para. 742.\n\nIbid., 746.\n\n389.\n\nArgentina reaffirmed, in the Rejoinder, its understanding of arbitrary as defined by the ICJ and not by its ordinary meaning as pretended by the Claimant.\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n390.\n\nArticle II.2(b) provides: \"Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For the purposes of dispute resolution under Articles VII and VIII, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.\"\n\n391.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the interpretation of the Claimant that a measure needs only to be arbitrary to constitute a breach of the BIT. This interpretation has not been contested by the Respondent and it follows from the alternative way in which the term \"measures\" is qualified by the adjectives \"arbitrary or discriminatory\". The parties disagree on whether the meaning of arbitrary should be the ordinary meaning of \"arbitrary\" or the meaning to arbitrary given by the ICJ in *ELSI*. The parties also disagree on the relevance of *Pope & Talbot* to this case and Argentina has pointed out the description of arbitrary given in *Genin*. The Tribunal is required to consider the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the BIT under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. The findings of other tribunals, and in particular of the ICJ, should be helpful to the Tribunal in its interpretative task.\n\n392.\n\nIn its ordinary meaning, \"arbitrary\" means \"derived from mere opinion\", \"capricious\", \"unrestrained\", \"despotic.\"324 Black's Law Dictionary defines the term, *inter alia*, as \"done capriciously or at pleasure\", \"not done or acting according to reason or judgment\", \"depending on the will alone.\" *Pope & Talbot* did not define arbitrary as it stood today. It only commented on the fact that the ICJ itself had moved from the standard advocated by Canada based on *Neer* to a less demanding standard. *Genin* does not seem to take notice of the change that has taken place when it adds the requirement of bad faith. The Tribunal finds that the definition in *ELSI* is close to the ordinary meaning of arbitrary since it emphasizes the element of willful disregard of the law.\n\n*Oxford English Dictionary*. This term is similarly defined in the *Diccionario de la lengua espa\u00f1ola*, 22nd edition at www.rae.es.\n\n393.\n\nThe question for the Tribunal is whether the measures taken by the Province can be considered to be arbitrary and have impaired \"the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal\" of the investment of Azurix in Argentina. The Tribunal finds that the actions of the provincial authorities calling for non-payment of bills even before the regulatory authority had made a decision, threatening the members of the ORAB because it had allowed ABA to resume billing, requiring ABA not to apply the new tariff resulting from the review of the construction variations and affirming that zone coefficients apply in contradiction with the information provided to the bidders at the time of bidding for the Concession, restraining ABA from collecting payment from its customers for services rendered before March 15, 2002, and denying to ABA access to the documentation on the basis of which ABA was sanctioned are arbitrary actions without base on the Law or the Concession Agreement and impaired the operation of Azurix's investment.\n\n**5. Full Protection and Security**\n-----------------------------------\n\n***(a) Positions of the Parties***\n----------------------------------\n\n394.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant argues that the standard of full protection and security imposes an obligation of vigilance and due diligence upon the government, as stated in *APPL*, \"according to modern doctrine, the violation of international law entailing the state's responsibility has to be considered constituted by 'the mere lack or want of diligence', without any need to establish malice or negligence\". The Claimant defines further the standard by referring to *AMT*. The tribunal in that case found that:\n\n\"It would not appear useful for the Tribunal to enter into the debate whether in the case on hand Zaire is bound by an obligation of result or simply an obligation of conduct. The Tribunal deems it sufficient to ascertain, as it has done, that Zaire has breached its obligation by taking no measure whatever that would serve to ensure the protection and security of the investment in question \u2026 Zaire is responsible for its inability to prevent disastrous consequences of these events affecting the investments of AMT which Zaire had the obligation to protect.\"325\n\nMemorial, p. 213.\n\n395.\n\nThe Claimant proceeds to argue that the standard goes beyond physical protection and includes the protection described in *CME Czech Republic B.V*.: \"The host State is obligated to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor's investment withdrawn or devalued.\"326\n\nIdem.\n\n396.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Argentina breached the standard so defined by failing to apply the regulatory framework and the Concession Agreement and thus destroying the security provided by them: the Province never revoked Resolutions 1/99 and 7/00 or decided on the RPI adjustment or on the issue of the valuations, ABA was never compensated for, *inter alia*, the Bah\u00eda Blanca damages, the Province insisted that ABA give up the right assured by the Law, Circular 52(A) and the Concession Agreement to recover the Canon in full, and the Respondent failed to take any action to protect the Claimant's investment.\n\n397.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent observes that Azurix had simply requested the use of its good offices to ensure the Province's compliance with the Concession Agreement. Thus Azurix was requesting assistance in a contractual dispute between ABA and the Province.327 The Respondent refers to the view held by the *ad hoc* Committee in *Aguas del Aconquija* and the assertion of the tribunal in that case that \"federal authorities could have reasonably considered the difference as being one of a contractual nature, and the scope of any federal obligation to react could have been reasonably influenced by this perception.\"328\n\nCounter-Memorial, para. 1035.\n\nIbid., para. 1037.\n\n398.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the nature of the dispute brought to its attention was a contractual dispute not a dispute related to an investment, and that no new ground may be adduced after filing, otherwise, either the claim was immature or there was a new dispute.329 The Respondent notes that the Claimant has not determined what specific duty to act it has breached under the BIT, and that the standard allegedly breached requires active behavior and not simply omissions In the duty of care.330\n\nIbid., para. 1039.\n\nIbid., paras. 1043 and 1047.\n\n399.\n\nThe Respondent also contests the relevance of cases such as *AAPL* and *AMT* which Involved physical destruction of facilities of the Investor by the armed forces. As for the relevance of *CME,* the Respondent points out that It Is questionable to adduce *CME* without referring to *Lauder* where, on the basis of the same facts, the tribunal reached the opposite conclusion.331\n\nIbid., para. 1050.\n\n400.\n\nAs a final argument, the Respondent requests the Tribunal, In examining Argentina\u2019s liability, to consider that, \"during the period under review the country was undergoing the worst economic, social and Institutional crisis In Its history.\"332\n\nIbid., 1051.\n\n401.\n\nIn Its Reply, the Claimant observes that the Respondent confuses \"Its obligation to comply affirmatively with the BIT standards In Its own conduct with Its ultimate responsibility under International law for violations of the BIT by Its political subdivisions.\"333 Acts or omissions of the Province that violate the BIT are \"necessarily and automatically\" the responsibility of Argentina under International law. Furthermore, It Is not correct that Azurix simply requested the good offices of Argentina In a contractual dispute. In Its response, Argentina Ignores clear statements In the communications of the Claimant addressed to Argentina whereby the latter Is Informed not only of contractual breaches but also of deviations from the regulatory framework and arbitrary acts of the officers and entitles of the Province which constitute violations of the BIT \"for which the Argentine Republic Is directly responsible.\" (letter of January 5, 2001). In another letter dated May 24, 2001, Azurix stated:\n\n\"The purpose of this letter Is to reiterate the need for the Argentine Republic to rectify the failure to comply with Its obligations under the BIT, International law and the Concession Agreement. The Argentine Republic has an obligation to prevent violations of the BIT and International law within Its territory whether committed by the federal government or Its political subdivisions. The federal government has an obligation to prevent expropriations [without compensation] by it or its political subdivisions. Azurix requests that the Argentine Republic take all necessary actions to prevent such violations \u2026\"334\n\nReply, para. 749.\n\nIbid., para. 753.\n\n402.\n\nThe Claimant considers that it has amply made its case on the responsibility of Argentina for the acts and omissions of the Province under international law, and that, \"It is unnecessary, and perhaps confusing, to analyze the GOA's liability as 'absolute' or 'strict' for the acts of its political subdivisions\", as mentioned by the Respondent.335\n\nIbid., para. 754.\n\n403.\n\nAs regards the allegation of the Respondent that no new grounds may be stated, Rule 40 of the Arbitration Rules permits a party to present incidental, ancillary or additional claims arising directly out of the subject matter of the dispute not later than the reply memorial.336\n\nIbid., para. 755.\n\n404.\n\nThe Claimant re-affirms that the standard of full protection and security is not limited to basic police functions as alleged by Argentina. The Claimant finds nothing in the language of the BIT that would limit the application of this standard to issues of physical security and protection. According to the Claimant, this standard requires the government to exercise \"vigilance and use due diligence within its political and legal system to protect investments.\"337\n\nIbid., para. 758.\n\n405.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Respondent refers to *Tecmed* that held that \"the guarantee of full protection and security is not absolute and does not impose strict liability upon the State that grants it.\" Based on this interpretation of the standard, the Respondent concludes that the argument of the Claimant cannot be accepted.338\n\nRejoinder, para. 1088.\n\n***(b) Considerations of the Tribunal***\n----------------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nWhile the cases of *APPL* and *AMT* refer to physical security, there are other cases in which tribunals have found that full protection and security has been breached because the investment was subject to unfair and inequitable treatment \u2013 *Occidental v. Ecuador* \u2013 or, conversely, they have held that the obligation of fair and equitable treatment was breached because there was a failure to provide full protection and security \u2013 *Wena Hotels v. Egypt*. The inter-relationship of the two standards indicates that full protection and security may be breached even if no physical violence or damage occurs as it was the case in *Occidental v. Ecuador*.\n\n407.\n\nIn some bilateral investment treaties, fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security appear as a single standard, in others as separate protections. The BIT falls in the last category; the two phrases describing the protection of investments appear sequentially as different obligations in Article II.2(a): \"Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and\u2026\" The tribunal in *Occidental* based its decision on a clause worded exactly like in the BIT, and nonetheless considered that, after it had found that the fair and equitable standard had been breached, \"the question of whether in addition there has been a breach of full protection and security under this Article becomes moot as a treatment that is not fair and equitable automatically entails an absence of full protection and security.\"339\n\n*Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador* (LCIA Administered Case No. UN 3467) Award, dated July 1, 2004, para. 187.\n\n408.\n\nThe Tribunal is persuaded of the interrelationship of fair and equitable treatment and the obligation to afford the investor full protection and security. The cases referred to above show that full protection and security was understood to go beyond protection and security ensured by the police. It is not only a matter of physical security; the stability afforded by a secure investment environment is as important from an investor's point of view. The Tribunal is aware that in recent free trade agreements signed by the United States, for instance, with Uruguay, full protection and security is understood to be limited to the level of police protection required under customary international law. However, when the terms \"protection and security\" are qualified by \"full\" and no other adjective or explanation, they extend, in their ordinary meaning, the content of this standard beyond physical security. To conclude, the Tribunal, having held that the Respondent failed to provide fair and equitable treatment to the investment, finds that the Respondent also breached the standard of full protection and security under the BIT.\n\n**VIII. Compensation**\n----------------------\n\n**1. Positions of the Parties**\n-------------------------------\n\n409.\n\nAzurix has requested full compensation for expropriation as required by the BIT under Article IV paragraph 1. Azurix has also argued that the expropriation was unlawful because it did not satisfy the form and substance requirements of due process nor was full or fair compensation paid. Therefore, Azurix claims that it is entitled to enhanced compensation that, in the words of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, \"wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if the act had not been committed.\"340\n\nMemorial, pp. 218-221.\n\n410.\n\nAzurix has proposed four possible dates for purposes of determining the compensation due for expropriation: (A) July 1999 just before the issuance of Resolution 1/99 on August 4; (B) December 2000, when the MSP Undersecretary had promised that the tariff issues would be resolved in favor of Azurix and they were not; (C) August 2001 when the Province denied any breaches of the Concession Agreement, the Tariff Regime or the Regulatory Framework and refused to permit ABA to fully recover the Canon payment; and (D) November 2001 when Decree No 2598/01 was issued refusing to accept ABA's notice of termination of October 5, 2001. Professor Riesman in his opinion cautioned that, in a case of creeping expropriation, the use of a later date may reward the Province for its own arbitrary conduct in regulating the Concession.341 Azurix takes the position that \"No matter what date is fixed by this Tribunal, the Province should not be permitted to benefit from its own unlawful acts.\"342\n\nExhibit to the Memorial, pp. 71-72.\n\nMemorial, p. 223.\n\n411.\n\nAzurix discusses the compensation methodologies for expropriation, and submits claims under each one of them without expressing a preference for one or another method. Under the actual investment method, Azurix claims to have invested $449 million when it acquired the Concession, $102.4 million in additional capital contributions to ABA, and $15 million on consequential costs including corporate expenditures and legal costs related to negotiations with the Province. Under the book value method and based on NERA's report calculation for each of the four dates referred to above, Azurix considers that the book value of the Concession in August 1999 was $516.9 million, in January 2001 $484.6 million, in August 2001 $483.9, and in November 2001 $482.2 million.343 Alternatively, Azurix submits the possibility for the Tribunal to consider compensation based on unjust enrichment - on the benefits received by the Province. On this basis, the Province was enriched by the Canon, the further investment of $102.4 million, and the time value - interest - of the funds. In the case of the Canon, Azurix submits that in accordance with the NERA report, the consideration of the time value would raise it to $450.5.344\n\nIbid., pp. 225-227.\n\nIbid., pp. 227-228.\n\n412.\n\nAdditionally, Azurix has claimed the amount due by customers to ABA when the Concession was taken over by the Province and which the Province publicly requested the customers not to pay to ABA. According to Azurix, these accounts receivable amounted approximately to AR$120 million.\n\n413.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent does not comment on the compensation claimed by Azurix. Azurix in its Reply, considers that, by not responding, Argentina has conceded Azurix's damages and reaffirms them. In its Rejoinder, Argentina notes that Azurix claimed compensation only for expropriation and questioned the dates chosen by the Claimant as possible dates for purposes of calculating compensation. Furthermore, Argentina argues that the standard of compensation under the BIT is the fair market value and that value cannot be the amount paid for the Concession when extraneous considerations influence it. Argentina recalls that the bid of Azurix was out of line with the other bids for the concession areas and calculates that, \"considering the bids that would have maximized the revenues of the Province from those regions [A, C1, C2, C3, and C4] excluding Azurix's bid, the maximum amount that would have been paid by the other bidders for the ABA Concession is 38.52 million dollars.\"345 In any case, argues Argentina, Azurix would not be entitled to more than 90% of the fair market value of ABA and the effect of the deep economic crisis that affected the country on asset values cannot be disregarded.346\n\nRejoinder, para. 1107.\n\nIbid., para. 1112.\n\n414.\n\nIn the Post-Hearing Memorial, the Claimant has defined \"full compensation\" as including, as a minimum, \"(i) the unamortized value of all investments made, including the US$438.55 million Canon payment and Azurix's additional capital contributions to ABA through 2002 of US$114,864,000, which were lost as a result of the GOA [Government of Argentina]\u2018s actions, (ii) discrete damages in excess of US$55 million, and (iii) costs.\"347\n\nPost-Hearing Memorial, para. 68.\n\n**2. Considerations of the Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------\n\n415.\n\nOn compensation, three issues have to be addressed by the Tribunal: (i) the difference in compensation claimed by Azurix in its various submissions, (ii) the starting point for the calculation of damages, and (iii) the principle upon which those damages should be based.\n\n416.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that Azurix's request for compensation in its Memorial is limited to amounts related to the Canon payment, the additional capital contributions made, the accounts receivable and consequential costs. This request is confirmed in the Reply. In the Post-Hearing Memorial the accounts receivable are not included in the definition of \"full compensation\" and, on the other hand, an amount in excess of $55 million is claimed on account of discrete damages detailed in the NERA report. The Tribunal considers that the Post-Hearing Memorial is not the place to change the submissions for compensation since the simultaneous timing of the memorials of the parties does not permit the other party to comment on the changes made. Thus, the Tribunal shall retain for consideration the compensation requested in the Memorial and confirmed in the Reply. The Tribunal is aware that the discrete damages listed in the NERA report are part of the allegations made in the Memorial but they were not included in the calculation of compensation pleaded then by the Claimant.\n\n417.\n\nAs to the second issue, various dates in 2001 have been proposed by Azurix. In a case of direct expropriation, the moment when expropriation has occurred can usually be established without difficulty. In the case where indirect or \"creeping\" expropriation has taken place or, as the *Santa Elena* tribunal put it, \"the date on which the governmental 'interference' has deprived the owner of his rights or has made those rights practically useless\"348, it will be much more difficult for the tribunal to establish the exact time of the expropriation. The difficulty is no less severe, unless the decision is based on a single act creating liability, when the Tribunal concludes that an investor has not received fair and equitable treatment or that it has been subjected to arbitrary treatment or that the host State has not provided the investor the full protection and security guaranteed by the BIT. The Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, in one of its awards, decided that \"where the alleged expropriation is carried out by way of a series of interferences in the enjoyment of property\", the date of the expropriation is \"the day when the interference has ripened into a more or less irreversible deprivation of the property rather than on the beginning date of the events\".349 It has been sometimes argued that applying this formula would lead to an inequitable situation where the investment's value would be assessed at the time when the cumulative actions of the State would have led to a dramatic devaluation of the investment. However, such a view does not take into account that, in assessing fair market value, a tribunal would establish that value in a hypothetical context where the State would not have resorted to such maneuvers but would have fully respected the provisions of the treaty and the contract concerned.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Dessarollo de Santa Elena, S.A.* v *. Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1), Award of February 17, 2000, 39 ILM 1317, 1330 (2000).\n\n*Malek* v. *Iran*, award 534-193-3, para. 1*14 (1992) (citin g Int'l Technical Prods. Corp. v. Iran*, Award No. 190-302-3, at 49, 9 Iran-U.S. Cl. Trib. Rep. 206, 240-241 (1985)).\n\n418.\n\nThere can be legitimate disagreement as to the date in 2001 at which the cumulative actions of the Province led to breaches of the Treaty; but, in the Tribunal's view, there can be no doubt that, by March 12, 2002 when the Province put an end to the Concession, alleging abandonment by ABA, its breaches of the BIT had reached a watershed. For purpose of calculating the compensation due to Azurix, this is the date which will be retained by the Tribunal.\n\n419.\n\nThe Tribunal will now proceed to deal with the third issue relating to compensation, i.e., the basis upon which the damages should be assessed. The Tribunal points out that the Treaty only provides for the measure of compensation in the case of an expropriation that meets the Treaty's requirements that it be done for a public purpose and be non-discriminatory. In such case, Article IV (1) of the BIT provides:\n\n\"Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier; be paid without delay; include interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation; be fully realizable; and be freely transferable at the prevailing market rate of exchange on the date of expropriation\".\n\n420.\n\nThe tribunal, in the recent *CMS v. Argentina* case, when faced with a similar situation, was \"persuaded that the cumulative nature of the breaches discussed here is best dealt with by resorting to the standard of fair market value. While this standard figures prominently in respect of expropriation, it is not excluded that it might also be appropriate for breaches different from expropriation if their effect results in important long-term losses\".350\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), para. 410.\n\n421.\n\nUnder NAFTA, tribunals which have held that a standard of protection was breached and no expropriation had occurred were in the same position as the Tribunal, since NAFTA does not provide for a measure of compensation in such situations. In three NAFTA cases, tribunals awarded damages for breaches other than expropriation, *S.D. Myers, Pope & Talbot* and *Feldman*. The tribunal in *Feldman* after having considered the other two cases concluded: \"It is obvious that in both of these earlier cases, which as here involved non-expropriation violations of Chapter 11, the tribunals exercised considerable discretion in fashioning what they believed to be reasonable approaches to damages consistent with the requirements of NAFTA.\"351\n\n*Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. The United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1), Award of December 16, 2002, para. 197.\n\n422.\n\nIn fact, in *S.D. Myers* the tribunal considered that the lack of a measure of compensation in NAFTA for breaches other than a finding of expropriation reflected the intention of the parties to leave it open to the tribunals to determine it in light of the circumstances of the case taking into account the principles of both international law and the provisions of NAFTA.352\n\n*S.D. Myers* v. *Canada*, Partial Award of November 13, 2000, paras. 303-319.\n\n423.\n\nIn *MTD*, another ICSID case, the tribunal found that the respondent had breached the fair and equitable treatment obligation and accepted the Claimants' proposal to apply the standard of compensation formulated in *Chorz\u00f3w*. The tribunal noted that the Respondent had not objected to the application of this standard and that \"no differentiation has been made about the standard of compensation in relation to the grounds on which it is justified. Therefore, the Tribunal will apply the standard of compensation proposed by the Claimants to the extent of the damages awarded.\"353\n\n*MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A. v. Chile* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7), Award of May 21, 2004, para. 238.\n\n424.\n\nIn the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that a compensation based on the fair market value of the Concession would be appropriate, particularly since the Province has taken it over. Fair market value has been defined as: \"the price, expressed in terms of cash equivalents, at which property would change hands between a hypothetical willing and able buyer and a hypothetical and able seller, acting at arm's length in an open and unrestricted market, when neither is under compulsion to buy or sell and when both have reasonable knowledge of the relevant facts.\"354\n\n*International Glossary of Business Valuation Terms*, American Society of Appraisers, ASA website, June 6, 2001, p. 4.\n\n425.\n\nAzurix has submitted, in its Memorial, two methodologies to measure fair market value in the present case: the actual investment and the book value. It has asserted in addition that the argument in support of using actual investment is compelling as the investment is recent and highly ascertainable. The Tribunal agrees that the actual investment method is a valid one in this instance. However, the Tribunal considers that a significant adjustment is required to arrive at the real value of the Canon paid by the Claimant.\n\n426.\n\nFirst of all, in the Tribunal's view, no well-informed investor, in March 2002, would have paid for the Concession the price (and more particularly, the Canon) paid by Azurix in mid-1999, irrespective of the actions taken by the Province and of the economic situation of Argentina at that time. In that regard, the Tribunal refers to some of the concerns expressed by OPIC at the time it denied financing the investment plan of ABA. As already noted, OPIC pointed out the size of the investments needed to achieve the Concession's objectives as compared to the estimated revenues expected from the tariffs in effect, and considered that failure to agree on a modification of the Concession in order to establish a sustainable situation was an obstacle to OPIC's financing. Yet, at the time Azurix won the Concession, the Province accepted the price paid by Azurix as the fair market price for the Concession and the Province benefited from the alleged aggressive price paid. Furthermore, there is no doubt that the loss in value is partly attributable to the actions of the Province and the politicization of the Concession.\n\n427.\n\nMore importantly, the Tribunal refers to the conclusions it reached concerning the RPI review process and the impossibility of including the Canon in the recoverable asset base for the purpose of tariff increases. Azurix has argued that the right price for an auctioned item is the price paid by the winning bidder. Argentina, for its part, argues that the fair market value of the Concession should be based on the much lower competing bids. The function of the Tribunal is not to second-guess the values established by the various bidders at the time of the privatization of AGOSBA, but to try and determine what an independent and well-informed third party would have been willing to pay for the Concession in March 2002, in a context where the Province would have honored its obligations. In that regard, being aware that the RPI tariff adjustment was not automatic and that the Canon could only be recoverable over the remaining duration (some 27 years and 9 \u00bd months) of the Concession and on the basis of the existing tariffs as adjusted periodically through the review process spelled out in the Concession Agreement, such investor would have realized that his only hope of recouping the Canon was essentially through expansion of the system and through efficiency improvements between the periodic 5-year tariff reviews. On the other hand, as to the RPI review process, it would have been reasonable for such an investor to conclude that the ORAB would have approved tariff increases from time to time to take into account the Argentine inflation rate, if not the American one.\n\n428.\n\nAt the same time, the Tribunal cannot ignore the fact that the Province, through its actions and inaction, contributed to the loss in value of the Concession. When the Province accepted Azurix`s bid, it considered it as the fair market value for the Concession and the Province benefited from the alleged aggressive price paid.\n\n429.\n\nConsidering those factors and valuing the Canon at present-day value, the Tribunal is of the opinion that no more than a fraction of the Canon could realistically have been recuperated under the existing Concession Agreement. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the value of the Canon on March 12, 2002 should be established at US$60,000,000 (sixty million US dollars).\n\n430.\n\nSecondly, Azurix should be compensated, as part of the fair market value of the Concession, for the additional investments to finance ABA. In its Memorial, Azurix has claimed US$102.4 million in additional capital contributions to the initial sum invested of US$449 million of which US$438,555,551 represent the payment for the Canon. The amount of US$102.4 million when added to the difference between the initial sum invested and the Canon results in investments additional to the Canon of US$112,844,446 (one hundred and twelve million eight hundred forty-four thousand four hundred forty-six US dollars). However, the Tribunal considers that this amount should be reduced by US$7,603,693 (seven million six hundred and three thousand six hundred ninety-three US dollars) which represent the aggregate of the claims presented by Azurix on account of damages which the Tribunal has found to be related to contractual claims -those related to the works listed in Circular 31(A) except for Bah\u00eda Blanca355- and that should be borne by Azurix as part of its business risk. Therefore, the amount awarded on account of additional investments is US$105,240,753 (one hundred and five million two hundred forty thousand seven hundred fifty-three US dollars).\n\nNERA Report, p.170. Exhibit 19-C to the Memorial.\n\n431.\n\nThirdly, Azurix has claimed AR$120 milllion on account of unpaid bills to ABA for services rendered prior to the take over of the Concession by the Province and which the Province directed customers not to pay to ABA. According to Argentina, only an amount of about half million pesos has been paid and it is held separately. The Tribunal notes that the amount claimed by Azurix represents all bills due by customers on March 7, 2002. The Tribunal considers that this amount is owed by the Province to ABA and, therefore, should not be part of the compensation awarded to Azurix..\n\n432.\n\nFourthly, Azurix has claimed US$15,000,000 (fifteen million US dollars) on account of consequential damages in order to wipe out the consequences of a breach of an international obligation. This amount relates to: (i) corporate expenditures for negotiations with the Province, termination of the Concession and transfer of the service (US$7.1 million), and (ii) costs for the preparation, registration, and participation in these proceedings (US$7.9million). The Tribunal will consider the second component as part of the award of costs of these proceedings. As for the first component, the Tribunal finds that it has not received sufficient evidence in support of such costs and that, in any case, these are costs related to the business risk that Azurix took when it decided to make the investment. Therefore, while the Tribunal agrees that in principle compensation should be such that wipes out the consequences of an illegal act, in the circumstances of this particular case, the Tribunal does not find the amount claimed to be justified.\n\n433.\n\nFithly, bearing in mind the responsibility of the Province in the failure of the Concession and the fact that the implementation of the POES was spread over a five-year period, while the Concession was cancelled after less than half of that time, the Tribunal concludes that Azurix should bear no liability with regard to the non-execution of that plan.\n\n434.\n\nThe Claimant has proposed, as an alternative to the fair market value of the investment, that compensation be based on \"the theory of unjust enrichment\". In this respect, the Claimant has referred to the decision of the court (in fact, an arbitral tribunal) in *Lena Goldfields* which chose to base the award on unjust enrichment rather than damages. As stated by the court and quoted in the Memorial:\n\n\"The Court further decides that the conduct of the Government was a breach of the contract going to the root of it. In consequence, Lena is entitled to be relieved from the burden of further obligations thereunder and to be compensated in money for the value of the benefits of which it had been wrongfully deprived. On ordinary legal principles this constitutes a right of action for damages, but the Court prefers to base its award on the principle of \"unjust enrichment,\" although in its opinion the money result is the same.\"356\n\nMemorial, p. 227.\n\n435.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the court did not give any reason for its choice of unjust enrichment as opposed to damages. This decision has been criticized for its lack of clarity and the reference to the same result in monetary terms,\n\n\"raises the suspicion that these considerations, far from being decisive for the outcome of the award, were merely used to add an appearance of broad general justice. This case, although frequently quoted in support of a 'principle against unjustified enrichment' in international law, has probably contributed nothing but a great deal of confusion.\"357\n\nChristoph Schreuer, \"Unjust Enrichment in International Law\", *The American Journal of Comparative Law*, vol. XXII, No. 2, p. 289.\n\n436.\n\nThe Tribunal further observes that damages and unjust enrichment are conceptually distinct in terms of the principles of liability and the measure of restitution. In the case of damages, liability rests on an unlawful act, which is not necessarily the case in unjust enrichment. As to compensation on account of an unlawful act, it is based on the loss suffered, while, in the case of unjust enrichment, it is based on restitution: for instance, what can be claimed, at least under some civil law regimes, is restitution of the lower of the amount contributed by the impoverished or the gain made by the enriched.358\n\nBryce Dickson, \"Unjust Enrichment Claims: a Comparative Overview\", *Cambridge Law Journal*, 54(1), March 1995, pp. 100-126; G. Bonet, \"L'enrichissement sans cause, droit priv\u00e9 et droit public\", *LITEC, Extrait du Juris-Classeur Civil,* 1989; Jason W. Neyers, Mitchell McInnes & Stephen G.A. Pitel, *Understanding Unjust Enrichment,* Oxford: Hart, 2004.\n\n437.\n\nThe Iran-US Tribunal, which has dealt with claims based on the principle of unjust enrichment on several occasions, defined the principle of unjust enrichment and its applicability as follows:\n\n\"There must have been an enrichment of one party to the detriment of the other, and both must arise as a consequence of the same act or event. There must be no justification for the enrichment, and no contractual or other remedy available to the injured party whereby he might seek compensation from the party enriched.\"359\n\n*Sea-Land Service, Inc*. v. *Iran* (6 Iran-U.S.C.T.R.) p. 169.\n\n438.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that Argentina breached the Treaty, an unlawful act under international law. The Claimant has chosen the remedy provided for in the Treaty and the Tribunal has also found that the measure of compensation applicable in this case is not the restitution of the Claimant's investment in respect of which the breach has been found but its fair market value before the breach occurred. For these reasons the Tribunal has not pursued the alternative of compensation on account of unjust enrichment proposed by the Claimant.\n\n**IX. Interest**\n----------------\n\n439.\n\nThe Claimant has requested the award of interest on all damages suffered at the average rate applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit compounded semi-annually. The Respondent has affirmed that it would not be legitimate to award compound interest and that, were the Tribunal to find for Azurix, a simple rate of interest should be used.\n\n440.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that compound interest reflects the reality of financial transactions, and best approximates the value lost by an investor. Therefore, compound interest should be paid on the amount of damages awarded as from the date at which the Province terminated the Concession \u2013 March 12, 2002 - until the date of dispatch of this award to the parties at the average rate applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit. In case the amount awarded is not paid in full 60 days after such date, the Respondent shall pay interest at the rate applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit until the day of payment in full and such rate shall also be compounded.\n\n**X. Costs**\n------------\n\n441.\n\nThe Claimant has partially prevailed on the merits. The Tribunal declined to issue the provisional order requested by the Claimant and Argentina failed in its objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and its challenge to the president of the Tribunal. The Claimant did not submit its own copy of envelopes 1 and 2 as requested by the Tribunal, and Argentina requested that the Claimant bear the costs related to this procedural incident. For these reasons, the Tribunal decides: (1) that each party shall pay its own costs and counsel fees, and (2) that the arbitrators' fees and expenses and the cost of the ICSID Secretariat shall be borne by Argentina, except for the amount of US$34,496 (thirty-four thousand four hundred ninety six U.S. dollars), which shall be borne by the Claimant and correspond to the said provisional measures and the procedural incident.\n\n**XI. Decision**\n----------------\n\n442.\n\nFor the reasons above stated, the Tribunal unanimously decides:\n\n1. That the Respondent did not breach Article IV(1) of the BIT.\n\n2. That the Respondent breached Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to Azurix's investment.\n\n3. That the Respondent failed to accord full protection and security to Azurix's investment under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.\n\n4. That the Respondent breached Article II(2)(b) of the BIT by taking arbitrary measures that impaired Azurix's use and enjoyment of its investment.\n\n5. To award compensation to Azurix on account of the fair market value of the Concession in the amount of US$165,240,753 (one hundred sixty-five million two hundred forty thousand seven hundred fifty-three US dollars), including in part the additional investments made by Azurix to finance ABA.\n\n6. To award interest compounded semi-annually on the amount referred to in paragraph 5 of this decision: (i) as from March 12, 2002 to June 30, 2006 at the rate of 2.44%, which is the average rate applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit during that period, and (ii) as from 60 days after the dispatch of this award to the parties until such amount has been fully paid at the average rate applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit.\n\n7. That each party shall be responsible for their own costs and counsel fees, and the Respondent shall bear the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the costs of the ICSID Secretariat except for US$34,496 (thirty-four thousand four hundred ninety six U.S. dollars) which shall be borne by Claimant.\n\n8. That all other claims are dismissed."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules)", "Type": "Stay of Enforcement", "Date": "2007-12-28T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award (Rule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn November 13, 2006, the Argentine Republic (\"Argentina\") filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\") an application in writing requesting the annulment of the Award, rendered by the Tribunal in the arbitration proceeding between Azurix Corp. (\"Azurix\") and Argentina of July 14, 2006.\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\"). In its Application, Argentina sought annulment of the Award on four of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically claiming that:\n\n(a) the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) there had been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and\n\n(d) that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based.\n\n3.\n\nThe Application also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment is decided.\n\n4.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on December 11, 2006, and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, transmitted a Notice of Registration to the parties. The parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of June 14, 2007, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified by the Centre that an *ad hoc* Committee (\"the Committee\") had been constituted, composed of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C., a national of Australia, Judge Bola Ajibola, a national of Nigeria, and Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., a national of Singapore. On the same date the parties were informed that Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n6.\n\nOn August 3, 2007, after hearing both parties' views concerning the schedule for the filing of written observations on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award as requested by Argentina, the Committee invited the parties to simultaneously submit their written observations on September 12, 2007. By the same letter, the Committee confirmed that the oral arguments on this matter would take place during the first session and informed the parties that the Committee would make a decision on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54.\n\n7.\n\nIn compliance with the Committee's instructions, on September 12, 2007, Argentina filed their Observations on the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, and Azurix filed their Opposition to Argentina's Request to Continue to Stay Enforcement of the Award.\n\n8.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held, as scheduled with the agreement of the parties, on September 20 and 21, 2007, at the premises of the World Bank in Washington D.C. Prior to the start of the session, the Secretariat distributed to the parties copies of the Declarations, signed by each Member of the Committee, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2). During the session on September 20, 2007, several issues of procedure were agreed and decided. On September 21, 2007, both parties addressed the Committee with their respective arguments concerning the question of the continuance of the stay of enforcement of the Award. During the session, the Committee put questions to the parties.\n\n9.\n\nAfter having heard the parties' arguments, the Committee offered Argentina an opportunity to file within seven days a statement in writing of their intention to comply with the Award under the ICSID Convention in the event that the Award is not annulled (\"the comfort letter\"). The Committee further decided that it would welcome Azurix to file any comments on Argentina's written statement within seven days after of such statement. At the same time, it decided to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award until it had taken a decision.\n\n10.\n\nOn September 27, 2007, Argentina submitted a written statement signed by Dr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino, Argentina's Attorney-General (Procurador General del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina), in which it stated \"[t]he Republic of Argentina hereby provides an undertaking to Azurix Corp. that, in accordance with its obligations under the ICSID Convention, it will recognize the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal in this proceeding as binding and will enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories, in the event annulment is not granted.\"\n\n11.\n\nIn a letter dated October 4, 2007, Azurix expressed their concern that Dr. Guglielmino's letter did not in fact provide additional comfort or security to Azurix, given Argentina's prior actions, and particularly in light of their recent public announcements that Argentina would not acknowledge the final and binding nature of the Decision on Annulment in *CMS v. Argentina* rendered by the *CMS ad hoc* Committee on September 25, 2007.1\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, September 25, 2007.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of October 5, 2007, Dr. Guglielmino responded to Azurix's letter of October 4, 2007, requesting that the Committee not reach a decision regarding the bank guarantee prior to giving Argentina an opportunity to present its case concerning the statements alleged by Azurix. Neither party made any further submissions after Argentina's letter of October 5, 2007.\n\n13.\n\nThe Members of the Committee have deliberated by various means of communication, and have taken into consideration the parties' entire written and oral arguments and submissions on the matter.\n\n**B. The parties' contentions**2\n--------------------------------\n\nIn reciting these submissions, the Committee is not to be taken as having accepted them, nor are they to be taken as being unchallenged by the other side.\n\n14.\n\nAs outlined above, Argentina has requested that the enforcement of the Award be stayed pending the Committee's decision on annulment. Its written submissions in support of the application (*inter alia*):\n\n(a) referred to the grounds upon which annulment is sought and stated that the request for annulment was not merely dilatory;\n\n(b) argued that circumstances exist justifying the continuance of the stay of enforcement of the Award;\n\n(c) referred to the amount of the Award (USD 165 million) in the context of the social and economic reconstruction efforts underway in Argentina as a result of the past and (in its submission) continuing economic crisis;\n\n(d) stated that, as was confirmed by the Argentine Supreme Court of Justice in 19923 and the amendment to the Argentine Constitution in 1994,4 the ICSID Convention (including Article 54) and any award rendered under it have supremacy over municipal law;\n\n(e) referred to previous decisions of *ad hoc* Committees in which enforcement of the award was stayed pending determination of the annulment application;5\n\n(f) stated that, as Azurix has been liquidating its assets from 2001 and ceased quoting on the New York Stock Exchange from March 2001, it would be impossible (or at least very hard) for Argentina to recover the Award if the annulment application succeeded;\n\n(g) argued that no bank guarantee should be required because:\n\n(i) Argentina's domestic law already secures execution of the Award;\n\n(ii) provision of such a guarantee would adversely affect the right of defense;\n\n(iii) no provision of the ICSID Convention establishes the need to post bonds for the purpose of continuing a stay of enforcement of an award;\n\n(iv) the commission that an international bank would charge to provide such a guarantee would be exorbitant (stated to be approximately USD 23 million);\n\n(v) as has been recognised in other ICSID cases,6 provision of a guarantee would place a claimant such as Azurix in a much more favourable position than it presently enjoys by converting an undertaking of compliance into a financial guarantee and by avoiding any issue of sovereign immunity; and\n\n(vi) provision of a guarantee would penalize Argentina for requesting annulment and curtail the right provided for by Article 52 of the ICSID Convention to apply for annulment.\n\nASCJ, 7/7/1992, *Ekmekdji* \u00e1 *n, Miguel Angel v.

Chile* (*op. cit*); and *CMS v. Argentina* (*op. cit*).\n\n15.\n\nAzurix opposed continuance of the stay and sought provision of security if the stay were to be continued. In its written submissions, Azurix pointed (*inter alia*) to the following:\n\n(a) under the ICSID Convention, arbitral awards are final and binding\u2014a stay interferes with the investor's right to an immediately payable and enforceable award and is an extraordinary measure not to be granted lightly;\n\n(b) the ICSID Arbitration Rules only allow for a stay where it is required (Rule 54(4)), and Argentina bears the burden of proving that a stay is required;\n\n(c) ICSID jurisprudence supports the requirement of security to \"counterbalance\" the negative effect of the stay on the award creditor;\n\n(d) the award creditor's \"annulment risk\" may be offset by a reduction of his enforcement risk by provision of security (citing Professor Schreuer's *The ICSID Convention: A Commentary*);7\n\n(e) the decisions of previous *ad hoc* Committees have been based on the view that annulment is a highly unusual step that delays payment to the award creditor and security has been ordered where there has been doubt regarding the award debtor's intent to comply promptly with the award on completion of the annulment process;8\n\n(f) scholarly commentary9 and the majority of ICSID *ad hoc* Committees make it clear that the posting of security when a provisional stay is continued should be \"an automatic, counterbalancing right\"10;\n\n(g) prior ICSID annulment Committees have determined that \"a primary factor\" to consider in evaluating whether to continue a stay is whether the state will promptly comply with the award if it is not annulled;11\n\n(h) there is little prospect that Argentina will comply with its obligation to pay Azurix as:\n\n(i) senior executive and judicial officers and the Attorney General have stated that Argentina will not comply with ICSID awards, but will submit them to Argentina's Supreme Court;\n\n(ii) the Attorney General has announced Argentina's intention to challenge ICSID awards before the International Court of Justice;\n\n(iii) Argentina remains in default of its international financial obligations;\n\n(i) a comfort letter such as that provided in *CMS v. Argentina* (which merely restates Argentina's obligations under Article 54(1) of the ICSID Convention) is not sufficient security when there is any doubt as to the State's intention to comply with the award. The standard that has emerged from the various security decisions rendered to date requires the elimination of any reasonable doubt as to the State's intent to comply;\n\n(j) the present annulment application is part of a manifest pattern of dilatory action on Argentina's part to extend each and every ICSID case;\n\n(k) while superior to local laws, international treaties are subordinate to the Argentine Constitution;\n\n(l) a recent Argentine Supreme Court decision12 supports the doctrine that Argentine Courts may review and vacate ICSID awards;\n\n(m) Argentina has the wherewithal to meet the Award or post security and will not suffer irreparable harm if the stay is discontinued or it is required to post security;\n\n(n) security is the remedy granted during an annulment process to ensure that the creditor \"does not suffer additional damages\" if enforcement of the Award is delayed;\n\n(o) accrual of interest does not redress the full measure of harm to Azurix that will result from additional delays because Azurix has a present right to compensatory funds and to *use* of the funds;\n\n(p) the argument that the provision of security would place Azurix in a better position than if annulment had not been sought is erroneous and has been consistently rejected since it was advanced in the *MINE* case;13 and\n\n(q) Argentina faces no danger of non-recoupment if the Award is annulled.\n\nCambridge University Press, 2001 at 1060, \u00b6483.\n\nAzurix referred to *CDC Group plc v.

Congo* (*op. cit*) \u00b633 in which the *ad hoc* Committee stated that any \"improvement\" to the award creditor by virtue of the security \"constitutes the counterbalance to the negative effect of the stay on the beneficiary, *i.e.* the counterbalance to the delay in his satisfaction through payment of the amount of the award, which in principle should be immediate\".\n\nAzurix referred to *MTD v.

At the conclusion of that hearing, the Committee allowed 7 days for Argentina to deliver (if it wished) a comfort letter such as was provided in *CMS v. Argentina*.\n\n17.\n\nAs noted in para 10 above, Argentina did provide a comfort letter in like terms to which Azurix responded.\n\n**C. Relevant ICSID Convention Articles and Arbitration Rules**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n18.\n\nArticle 52 of the ICSID Convention *p* rovides:\n\n*(1 ) Either party may request annulment of the award by an ap plication in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*(5) The Committee may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, stay enforcement of the award pending its decision. If the applicant requests a stay of enforcement of the award in his application, enforcement shall be stayed provisionally until the Committee rules on such request.*\n\n\u2026\n\n19.\n\nArticles 53 to 55 provide:\n\n*Article 53*\n\n*(1) The award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention. Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention.*\n\n*(2) For the purposes of this Section, \"award\" shall include any decision interpreting, revising or annulling such award pursuant to Articles 50, 51 or 52.*\n\n*Article 54*\n\n*(1) Each Contracting State shall recognize an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State. A Contracting State with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the courts of a constituent state.*\n\n*(2) A party seeking recognition or enforcement in the territories of a Contracting State shall furnish to a competent court or other authority which such State shall have designated for this purpose a copy of the award certified by the Secretary-General. Each Contracting State shall notify the Secretary-General of the designation of the competent court or other authority for this purpose and of any subsequent change in such designation.*\n\n*(3) Execution of the award shall be governed by the laws concerning the execution of judgments in force in the State in whose territories such execution is sought.*\n\n*Article 55*\n\n*Nothing in Article 54 shall be construed as derogating from the law in force in any Contracting State relating to immunity of that State or of any foreign State from execution.*\n\n20.\n\nRule 54 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules applies to the present case and provides:\n\n*Stay of Enforcement of the Award*\n\n*(1) The party applying for the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award may in its application, and either party may at any time before the final disposition of the application, request a stay in the enforcement of part or all of the award to which the application relates. The Tribunal or Committee shall give priority to the consideration of such a request.*\n\n*(2) If an application for the revision or annulment of an award contains a request for a stay of its enforcement, the Secretary-General shall, together with the notice of registration, inform both parties of the provisional stay of the award. As soon as the Tribunal or Committee is constituted it shall, if either party requests, rule within 30 days on whether such stay should be continued; unless it decides to continue the stay, it shall automatically be terminated.*\n\n*(3) If a stay of enforcement has been granted pursuant to paragraph (1) or continued pursuant to paragraph (2), the Tribunal or Committee may at any time modify or terminate the stay at the request of either party. All stays shall automatically terminate on the date on which a final decision is rendered on the application, except that a Committee granting the partial annulment of an award may order the temporary stay of enforcement of the unannulled portion in order to give either party an opportunity to request any new Tribunal constituted pursuant to Article 52(6) of the Convention to grant a stay pursuant to Rule 55(3).*\n\n*(4) A request pursuant to paragraph (1), (2) (second sentence) or (3) shall specify the circumstances that require the stay or its modification or termination. A request shall only be granted after the Tribunal or Committee has given each party an opportunity of presenting its observations.*\n\n*(5) The Secretary-General shall promptly notify both parties of the stay of enforcement of any award and of the modification or termination of such a stay, which shall become effective on the date on which he dispatches such notification.*\n\n**D. The Committee's views**\n----------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Committee has indicated, and now confirms, its determination that, for the reasons submitted by Argentina, the circumstances require a stay of enforcement of the Award pending its decision on the annulment application.\n\n22.\n\nAlthough the Committee accepts that there may be very exceptional circumstances where a stay ought not be ordered, that is not the situation here. The Committee has not convincingly been taken to matters militating against the continuation of the stay, as distinct from the contested issue of the continuation of the stay being conditional upon the provision of security.\n\n23.\n\nTurning to the issue of security, decisions of previous *ad hoc* Committees considering stay applications disclose divergent approaches. The prior decisions are most recently rehearsed in *CMS v. Argentina.*14\n\n(ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on the Argentine Republic's Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award, September 1, 2006 in which the decisions in *Amco I* (*op. cit*), *MINE v. Guinea* (*op. cit*), *Wena Hotels v. Egypt* (*op. cit*), *CDC v. Seychelles* (*op. cit*), *Mitchell v. Congo* (*op. cit*), *MTD v. Chile* (*op. cit*) and *Repsol v. Petroecuador* (*op. cit*) are cited.\n\n24.\n\nThe general approach of the Committee is against a strict analysis of previous Committee decisions in stay applications as if they were common law precedents. They are single examples of the exercise of the jurisdiction under Article 52(5) in particular circumstances.\n\n25.\n\nWhilst for this reason the Committee does not regard it as appropriate for it to offer its own analysis of each of those decisions, the Committee's approach remains that it does not accept Azurix's contentions that a rule or norm has emerged mandating that the provision of security is *\"an automatic or counterbalancing right\"* to a stay or that, save for limited exceptions, it ought to be required as of course in order to eliminate any *\"reasonable doubt as to the State's intent to comply\".*\n\n26.\n\nThe terms of the ICSID Convention are the source of the Tribunal's or Committee's power to modify or grant a stay. Hence, consideration of whether a stay should be granted, on the condition that security should be provided, must be guided by and conform to the terms of the ICSID Convention.\n\n27.\n\nRelevantly here, the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties15 provides some guidance on the interpretation of the ICSID Convention, based on the primacy of the text embodying a state party's commitments. Article 31(1) provides:\n\n*A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\nVienna, 23 May 1969, Articles 31-33.\n\n28.\n\nIn this regard, it is essential to the integrity of the ICSID Convention that there be a mechanism to annul decisions infected by vitiating error or irregularity.\n\n29.\n\nThe limited grounds upon which annulment may be sought are set out in Article 52(1):\n\n*(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based*.\n\n30.\n\nGenerally, the Article 52(1) grounds are directed to defined grave injustices. Where any ground is established, the integrity of the ICSID arbitration system and a state party participant's continued confidence in it demand that the infecting error be rectified by annulment.\n\n31.\n\nThe Committee agrees that the occurrence of such errors and irregularities will be infrequent to the point of being exceptional, but as the recent decision in the *CMS* case (where Argentina was a party) exemplifies, annulment may be granted.16 However, it does not follow that any particular annulment proceeding *per se* should be regarded as exceptional in itself so as to justify orders for provision of security in the ordinary course. The systemic importance of the annulment procedure must not be overlooked. It is not obviated or reduced in its application simply because a party to a specific case has sought annulment, or a state party has generally stated an intention to seek review of other or all adverse ICSID determinations to which it is a party. To require that security be provided as a matter of course in all but the exceptional case would risk compromising the important confidence-balancing function for state parties served by the annulment procedure.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Decision on Annulment, September 25, 2007.\n\n32.\n\nA further relevant factor for the Committee is that, because security ordinarily would only be sought against a developing country, it would risk undermining the confidence of all states in the transparency of the ICSID system by introducing the suggestion of discrimination between states, whether *de jure* or *de facto,* as to terms for security imposed on annulment applications.\n\n33.\n\nEither party to an ICSID dispute has the right to request annulment of an award pursuant to Article 52. That right is not qualified explicitly in the Convention by a requirement that the unsuccessful party provide any security as the \"price\" for a stay. Rather, Article 52(5) merely grants the *ad hoc* Committee considering the annulment request power to stay the award a general discretion \"*if it considers that the circumstances so require\"*.\n\n34.\n\nTo apply a strict rule that the price for the stay is the provision of security appears to the Committee to create a positive gloss to the enforcement regime provided for under Section 6 of the Convention. Effectively, such an approach would be to add a provision that is neither express nor implicit in the ICSID Convention. Indeed, it would effectively abrogate the scheme for security in Section 6 (particularly under Article 54) and substitute for those expressly qualified rights an entitlement to absolute security.\n\n35.\n\nIn the Committee's view, such a default position would be in derogation to the approach to interpretation reflected in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention (see para 27 above) and also would work in a *de facto* sense impermissibly to amend the ICSID Convention by substituting a new and absolute enforcement mechanism for the qualified provisions of the Convention itself.\n\n36.\n\nAlthough not required by the Committee, here Argentina has proffered a comfort letter of the kind provided in *CMS v. Argentina*. This Committee's conclusion that security will not be required does not rest on the provisions of that letter, as it merely confirms and restates Argentina's obligations under the ICSID Convention in circumstances where Argentina's domestic enforcement machinery conforms to Article 54.\n\n37.\n\nOn the issue of onus, and perhaps in contrast to the contrary suggestion by the *ad hoc* Committee in *CMS v. Argentina*, the Committee does not see that the applicant for annulment bears any burden of persuasion as to why security should not be ordered. To the contrary: it is for the claimant to make out its case for security consequent upon a stay being ordered.\n\n38.\n\nHere Argentina has not denounced the ICSID Convention,17 and continues to be bound by its obligations under Article 54 to recognize and enforce ICSID awards as final judgments of domestic courts. Hence, the primary security for Azurix's award is provided through the obligations Argentina has assumed under the Convention. Further, Argentina's constitutional and municipal law enforcement regimes are in conformity with the Convention.\n\nArticle 71 provides that any Contracting State may denounce the Convention by written notice, taking effect six months after receipt of such notice.\n\n39.\n\nIn the absence of a history of non-payment by Argentina of final ICSID awards (there are as yet none), or a failure to put in place domestic enforcement mechanisms in accordance with Article 54 or other exceptional circumstances, it appears to the Committee that the ICSID Convention does not support any such default approach that security should be the price extracted for a stay which a committee has concluded is \"required\" within the meaning of Article 52(5).\n\n40.\n\nOther than by being put to the effort and expense of defending an annulment request and by the receipt of funds being delayed (assuming the annulment application to be unsuccessful), the Committee does not accept that Azurix suffers any prejudice of a kind warranting the provision of security. The provision for interest compensates for the delay.18\n\nThe fact that interest rates are below market is not be to the point, as the rates are those that prevail in the ICSID system, which is not tied to the global, or any domestic, market.\n\n41.\n\nRather, Azurix submits that, upon the making of the Award, it had a present entitlement to payment on an enforceable award and that this would be prejudiced by the continuance of the stay. In answer, the Committee perceives that Azurix's submission fails to take adequate account of the terms of Article 53, which relevantly states that:\n\n*Each party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award except to the extent that enforcement shall have been stayed pursuant to the relevant provisions of this Convention* (emphasis added).\n\n42.\n\nAs the ICSID Convention explicitly recognizes that the award creditor's rights are subject to a stay if an *ad hoc* Committee considers, as we do, that the circumstances require a stay, then the award creditor's rights are themselves qualified by the Convention. Accordingly, the rights an award creditor would have had to payment had there been no stay cannot, by definition, constitute the subject of prejudice.\n\n43.\n\nHad Argentina not sought annulment, Azurix would not have had the benefit of a bank guarantee. Upon non-satisfaction of the Award it would have to take enforcement action and meet, for example, enforcement issues such as the potential application of sovereign immunity under Article 55. The situation here is not a scenario, such as that mentioned in the *CDC* case (referring to *MINE v. Guinea* and *WENA v. Egypt*),19 where the respondent might have moved assets in the period between the initial award and the determination of the annulment request. There is no suggestion by Azurix that Argentina is presently unable to meet the amount of the Award or that it is likely to engage in \"asset stripping\" pending determination of the annulment application or otherwise avoid its obligations under the ICSID Convention. Nor could such a suggestion credibly be made. In the *CDC* case, there were other factors justifying the provision of security, *viz* the relatively small amount of the guarantee and the fact that the Republic of Seychelles had already admitted liability for a substantial portion of the award.\n\n*CDC v. Seychelles* (*op. cit*) \u00b619.\n\n44.\n\n*In summary*, although the Committee accepts that in particular fact situations there may be exceptional circumstances where real prejudice beyond delay compensated for by interest may be shown, such as where a state denounces its obligations under the Convention or otherwise evinces an intention not to comply with the award, that is not the situation here. The determinative issue is whether, beyond delay compensated for by interest, there is any factor here militating for the imposition of security for payment over and above that provided for by Argentina's commitments under the ICSID Convention. For the reasons stated, the Committee finds no such factors are established.\n\n**Decision**\n------------\n\n**For the foregoing reasons the** ***ad hoc*** **Committee, unanimously decides that the stay on the enforcement of the Award should continue in force pending its decision on Argentina's application for annulment and declines to order the provision of any security during the period of the stay.**"}, {"Title": "Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2009-09-01T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TABLE OF ABBREVIATED REFERENCES** | |\n| AAS | Azurix AGOSBA S.R.L. |\n| ABA | Azurix Buenos Aires S.A.

(\"Azurix\") and Argentina on July 14, 2006.\n\n2.\n\nThe Application was made within the time period provided in Article 52(2) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"the ICSID Convention\").1 In its Application, Argentina sought annulment of the Award on four of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention, specifically claiming that:\n\n(a) under Article 52(1)(a) the Tribunal was not properly constituted;\n\n(b) under Article 52(1)(b) the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers;\n\n(c) under Article 52(1)(d) there had been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and\n\n(d) under Article 52(1)(e) the Award failed to state the reasons on which it was based.\n\nConvention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States, March 18, 1965, 575 UNTS 159\n\n3.\n\nThe Application also contained a request, under Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 54(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"), for a stay of enforcement of the Award until the Application for Annulment was decided.\n\n4.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Application on December 11, 2006 and on the same date, in accordance with Rule 50(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, transmitted the Notice of Registration to the parties. The parties were also notified that, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(2), the enforcement of the Award was provisionally stayed.\n\n5.\n\nBy letter of June 14, 2007, in accordance with Rule 52(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the parties were notified by the Centre that an *ad hoc* Committee (\"the Committee\") had been constituted, composed of Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C., a national of Australia, Judge Bola Ajibola, a national of Nigeria, and Mr. Michael Hwang S.C., a national of Singapore. On the same date the parties were informed that Ms. Claudia Frutos-Peterson, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Committee. On May 14, 2009, Ms Natali Sequeira, Counsel, ICSID, was appointed as Secretary of the Committee.\n\n6.\n\nOn August 3, 2007, after hearing both parties\u2019 views concerning the schedule for the filing of written observations on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award as requested by Argentina, the Committee invited the parties to simultaneously submit their written observations on September 12, 2007. By the same letter, the Committee confirmed that the oral arguments on this matter would take place during the first session and informed the parties that the Committee would make a decision on the continuation of the stay of enforcement of the Award in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 54.\n\n7.\n\nIn compliance with the Committee\u2019s instructions, on September 12, 2007, Argentina filed its Observations on the Continuation of the Stay of Enforcement of the Award, and Azurix filed its Opposition to Argentina\u2019s Request to Continue to Stay Enforcement of the Award.\n\n8.\n\nThe first session of the Committee was held, as scheduled with the agreement of the parties, on September 20 and 21, 2007, at the premises of the World Bank in Washington D.C. Prior to the start of the session, the Secretariat distributed to the parties copies of the Declarations, signed by each Member of the Committee, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2). During the session on September 20, 2007, several issues of procedure were agreed and decided. On September 21, 2007, both parties addressed the Committee with their respective arguments concerning the question of the continuance of the stay of enforcement of the Award. During the session, the Committee put questions to the parties.\n\n9.\n\nAfter having heard the parties\u2019 arguments, the Committee offered Argentina an opportunity to file within seven days a statement in writing of its intention to comply with the Award under the ICSID Convention in the event that the Award was not annulled (\"the Comfort letter\"). The Committee further decided that it would welcome Azurix to file any comments on Argentina\u2019s written statement within seven days after such statement. At the same time, it decided to continue the stay of enforcement of the Award until it had taken a decision.\n\n10.\n\nOn September 27, 2007, Argentina submitted a written statement signed by Dr. Osvaldo C\u00e9sar Guglielmino, Argentina\u2019s Attorney-General (Procurador General del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n Argentina), which stated *\"[t]he Republic of Argentina hereby provides an undertaking to Azurix Corp, that, in accordance with its obligations under the ICSID Convention, it will recognize the award rendered by the Arbitral Tribunal in this proceeding as binding and will enforce the pecuniary obligations imposed by that award within its territories, in the event annulment is not granted. \"*\n\n11.\n\nIn a letter dated October 4, 2007, Azurix expressed its concern that Dr. Guglielmino\u2019s letter did not in fact provide additional comfort or security to Azurix, given Argentina\u2019s prior actions, and particularly in light of its recent public announcements that Argentina would not acknowledge the final and binding nature of the Decision on Annulment in *CMS v. Argentina* rendered by the CMS *ad hoc* Committee on September 25, 2007.2\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Annulment, September 25, 2007 (\"CMS Annulment Decision\").\n\n12.\n\nBy letter of October 5, 2007, Dr. Guglielmino responded to Azurix\u2019s letter of October 4, 2007, requesting the Committee not to reach a decision regarding the bank guarantee prior to giving Argentina an opportunity to present its case concerning the statements alleged by Azurix.\n\n13.\n\nAfter considering the parties\u2019 written and oral arguments on the matter and due deliberation, the Committee issued on December 28, 2007 its *Decision on the Argentine Republic\u2019s Request for a Continued Stay of Enforcement of the Award.*\n\n14.\n\nIn its Decision, the Committee unanimously ordered that the stay of execution *\"should continue in force pending its decision on Argentina\u2019s application for annulment\"* and declined *\"to order the provision of any security during the period of the stay. \"*\n\n15.\n\nIn accordance with the timetable set forth by the Committee during the September 21-22, 2007 session, Argentina filed its Memorial on Annulment on January 8, 2008. On May 7, 2008, Azurix filed its Counter-Memorial.\n\n16.\n\nIn reply to a letter from ICSID dated May 23, 2008, the parties signified their agreement on June 2, 2008 to the proposal of the President of the Committee to appoint a Legal Assistant, Ms. Freya Baetens, to assist the Committee in the proceedings.\n\n17.\n\nThe Argentine Republic filed its Reply on Annulment on June 18, 2008, and Azurix filed its Rejoinder on July 28, 2008.\n\n18.\n\nAfter consultation with the parties, the President of the Committee held a preliminary organizational telephone conference call with counsel for both parties on September 3, 2008. The conference call was attended by Mr. Craig Miles, Mr. Rodrigo Castillo, Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil and Mr. Francisco Guti\u00e9rrez, on behalf of Azurix and by Dr. Gabriel Bottini, Professor Philippe Sands, Ms. Gisela Makowski and Ms. Mar\u00eda Alejandra Etchegorry, on behalf of the Argentine Republic. During the conference call the parties agreed on the manner in which the hearing on annulment would be conducted. These agreements were reflected in the Committee\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1 dated September 10, 2008.\n\n19.\n\nBy letter dated September 16, 2008, Azurix submitted its additional documents for the hearing. By email of September 17, 2008, Argentina submitted its additional documents, including lists containing new Exhibits and new Legal Authorities.\n\n20.\n\nAs agreed, a 2-day hearing was held at the World Bank offices in Paris on September 29 and 30, 2008, at which counsel presented their arguments and submissions, and responded to questions from the Members of the Committee. Present at the hearing were:\n\n\u2014 the members of the Committee: Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C., President; Judge Bola Ajibola and Mr. Michael Hwang S.C.;\n\n\u2014 the representatives of Azurix: Mr. R. Doak Bishop, Mr. Craig Miles and Ms. Nanni Kerrie of King & Spalding; Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil, Mr. Francisco Guti\u00e9rrez and Mr. Federico Campolieti of M. & M. Bomchil and Mr. Rod Castillo of Azurix Corp.; and\n\n\u2014 the representatives of the Argentine Republic: Mr. Adolfo Gustavo Scrinzi, Dr. Gabriel Bottini, Mr. Ignacio P\u00e9rez Cort\u00e9s, Mr. Nicol\u00e1s Diana, Ms. Ver\u00f3nica Lavista and Ms. Mar\u00eda Alejandra Etchegorry of the Procuraci\u00f3n del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n; Ms. Guillermina Cinti of the Provincia de Buenos Aires; Professor Philippe Sands of Matrix Chambers and University College London; Mr. Zachary Douglas of Matrix Chambers and Cambridge University; Ms. Penny Martin of University College London; and Alejandro Daniel Korn and Jonathan Etra of Ferrel Law: and\n\n\u2014 the legal assistant of the Committee: Ms. Freya Baetens;\n\n21.\n\nFollowing the ruling of the Committee on September 29, 2008 as to the inadmissibility of experts\u2019 reports filed by the parties, on October 10, 2008, the parties filed letters identifying particular paragraphs of their expert reports upon which they relied as part of their submissions, to which answering objections were made by the parties by letters dated October 17, 2008.\n\n22.\n\nOn August 24, 2009, the Committee declared the closure of the proceeding pursuant to Arbitration Rule 38.\n\n23.\n\nDuring the course of the proceedings, the Members of the Committee deliberated by various means of communication and have taken into account all pleadings, documents and testimony before them, including documents tendered at the hearing.\n\n**B. The dispute**\n------------------\n\n24.\n\nIn 1996 the Province of Buenos Aires (the \"Province\") commenced privatization of the services of Administraci\u00f3n General de Obras Sanitarias de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (\"AGOSBA\"), the Province-owned and -operated company which provided potable water and sewerage services in the Province. The Province passed Law 11,820 (\"the Law\") to create the regulatory framework for privatization of AGOSBA\u2019s services. Under the Law, the future operator of the water services would be granted a concession which would be overseen and regulated by a new regulatory authority established for the purpose, Organismo Regulador de Aguas Bonaerense (\"ORAB\"). The concessionaire was required to be a company incorporated in Argentina. The Province engaged Schroeders Argentina S.A. (\"Schroeders\") as adviser for the privatization of AGOSBA and requested Schroeders to distribute an information statement to potential investors. Schroeders sent the information statement to ENRON Corporation (\"ENRON\"), a United States corporation, inviting this company to participate in the bidding. ENRON requested from a consulting company, Hytsa Estudios y Proyectos S.A. (\"Hytsa\"), a preliminary report on the information furnished by the Province on AGOSBA and its operations.\n\n25.\n\nThe privatization process was conducted by the Privatization Commission, which tendered the concession on the international market on the basis of the Law and of a set of contract documents prepared in accordance with the Law by ORAB, including the Bidding Terms and Conditions and a draft Concession Agreement.\n\n26.\n\nA bid offer was made by two companies of the Azurix group established for this specific purpose: Azurix AGOSBA S.R.L. (\"AAS\") and Operadora de Buenos Aires S.R.L. (\"OBA\"). AAS and OBA are indirect subsidiary companies of Azurix. AAS was registered in Argentina and was 0.1% owned by Azurix and 99.9% owned by Azurix Argentina Holdings Inc. (a company incorporated in Delaware), which in turn was 100% owned by Azurix. OBA, also registered in Argentina, was 100% owned by Azurix Agosba Holdings Limited, a company registered in the Cayman Islands. Azurix owns 100% of the shares in Azurix Agosba Holdings Limited.\n\n27.\n\nHaving successfully won their bid, AAS and OBA incorporated Azurix Buenos Aires S.A. (\"ABA\") in Argentina to act as concessionaire. On June 30, 1999, ABA (also referred to as \"the Concessionaire\") made a \"canon payment\" of 438,555,554 Argentine pesos (\"the Canon\") to the Province.3 On payment of the canon, ABA, AGOSBA and the Province executed a concession agreement (\"the Concession Agreement\") which granted ABA a 30-year concession for the distribution of potable water, and the treatment and disposal of sewerage in the Province (\"the Concession\"). Handover of the service took place on July 1, 1999.\n\nAt the time the Canon was paid the Argentine Peso was fixed in a one to one ratio with the United States dollar. The Argentine Peso was pegged to the US dollar until December 31,2001, when \"pesification\" was implemented by Argentina in response to its economic crisis *(*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on Jurisdiction, December 8, 2003 [\"Decision on Jurisdiction\"], footnote 1*).\n\n28.\n\nAzurix declared that it knew and accepted the bidding conditions and committed itself to undertake all measures necessary to ensure that OBA would fulfill the obligations set forth in the bidding conditions and the Concession Agreement as operator of the Concession during the first 12 years of operation. Similarly, Azurix accepted that it would be jointly responsible for the obligations of AAS and that during the first six years of the Concession there would be no change in the control of AAS.\n\n29.\n\nIn the proceedings Azurix contended:\n\n(a) that its investment in Argentina was expropriated by measures of Argentina tantamount to expropriation and that Argentina had, in addition, violated its obligations, under the BIT, of fair and equitable treatment, non-discrimination and full protection and security;\n\n(b) that such measures were actions or omissions of the Province or its instrumentalities that resulted in the non-application of the tariff regime of the Concession for political reasons;\n\n(c) that the Province did not complete certain works that were to remedy historical problems and were to be transferred to the Concessionaire upon completion;\n\n(d) that the lack of support for the concession regime prevented ABA from obtaining financing for its Five Year Plan;\n\n(e) that in 2001, the Province denied that the canon was recoverable through tariffs; and\n\n(f) that *\"political concerns were always privileged over the financial integrity of the Concession\",4* and *\"[w]ith no hope of recovering its investments in the politicized regulatory scheme, ABA gave notice of termination of the Concession and was forced to file for bankruptcy5*\n\nAward \u00b6 43 referring to Azurix\u2019s Memorial, p. 7.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n30.\n\nArgentina disputed the allegations of Azurix. According to Argentina, the dispute was a contractual dispute and the difficulties encountered by the Concessionaire in the Province were of its own making. In particular, Argentina argued:\n\n(a) that the case presented by Azurix was intimately linked to Enron\u2019s business practices and its bankruptcy;\n\n(b) that the price paid for the Concession was excessive and opportunistic and related to the forthcoming IPO of Azurix at the time Azurix bid for the Concession through AAS and OBA; and\n\n(c) that the Concessionaire did not comply with the Concession Agreement, in particular its investment obligations, so that the actions of the Province, including the termination of the Concession Agreement by the Province, were justified.\n\n31.\n\nOn September 19, 2001, Azurix filed a request for arbitration with ICSID against the Republic of Argentina, based upon the alleged violation of several articles of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Argentine Republic Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment (the \"BIT\").6 Azurix alleged that Argentina\u2019s treatment of Azurix\u2019s investment was tantamount to expropriation; that Argentina failed to provide fair and equitable treatment, and full protection and security to Azurix\u2019s investment; that Argentina did not observe the obligations that it had entered into with respect to Azurix's investment, had acted arbitrarily, and did not act transparently. The arbitral tribunal (the \"Tribunal\") was duly constituted on April 8, 2002.\n\nSigned November 14, 1991 ; entered into force October 20, 1994.\n\n32.\n\nThe Tribunal rendered a decision on its jurisdiction (the \"Decision on Jurisdiction\") on December 8, 2003, in which the Tribunal found that:\n\n*(a) Azurix has shown that, prima facie, it has a claim against Argentina for breach of obligations owed by Argentina to Azurix under the BIT;*\n\n*(b) Azurix has ius standi to bring this claim, and*\n\n*(c) the present dispute is within the jurisdiction of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal7*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 102.\n\n33.\n\nThe hearings on the merits took place from October 4 to 13, 2004 and on November 30, 2004 post-hearing briefs were filed. On November 29, 2004, Argentina submitted a proposal challenging the appointment of Dr. Rigo Sureda as President of the Tribunal, pursuant to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).\n\n34.\n\nDr. Rigo Sureda defended his position in a letter of December 10, 2004 on which Argentina commented on December 30, 2004. Further correspondence from Azurix\u2019 counsel dated January 28, 2005 and February 1, 2005 elaborated on the disclosure of Fulbright & Jaworski\u2019s representation of one affiliate of Azurix Corp, and of one affiliate of Enron Corp, (see paragraphs 261 to 266 below).\n\n35.\n\nOn February 25, 2005, the two co-arbitrators of Dr. Rigo Sureda issued their decision on the matter of the Disqualification Request of Dr. Rigo Sureda (the \"Disqualification Decision\"),8 finding that:\n\n*By any reasonable standard it cannot be said in the present case that the party putting forward its Proposal has acted promptly... The Tribunal therefore concludes that Argentina is deemed to have waived its right to request the disqualification of Dr. Rigo, on the ground that it has not reacted with the promptness required by Rules 9 and 27 of the Arbitration Rules..9*\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on the Challenge to the President of the Tribunal, February 25, 2005 (the \"Disqualification Decision\").\n\nDisqualification Decision \u00b6 7-8.\n\n36.\n\nThe Tribunal further rejected the challenge to Dr. Rigo Sureda on the ground that:\n\n*... [i]t is difficult to conclude that this situation would lead to a judge party relationship\u2019 as argued by Argentina. And to pretend that because of his appointment, Dr. Tawil would somehow \"have authority\" over Dr. Rigo, simply because he is a member of the firm which appointed him in a totally different case from the one in which Dr. Rigo acts as* *arbitrator, would certainly be stretching any reasonable concept of the powers of arbitrators.*\n\n37.\n\nIn its Award of July 14, 2006, the Tribunal unanimously decided:\n\n*1. That the Respondent did not breach Article IV(1) of the BIT [the expropriation clause].*\n\n*2. That the Respondent breached Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to Azurix\u2019s investment.*\n\n*3. That the Respondent failed to accord full protection and security to Azurix\u2019s investment under Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT.*\n\n*4. That the Respondent breached Article ll(2)(b) of the BIT by taking arbitrary measures that impaired Azurix\u2019s use and enjoyment of its investment.*\n\n*5. To award compensation to Azurix on account of the fair market value of the Concession in the amount of US$165,240,753 (one hundred sixty-five million two hundred forty thousand seven hundred fifty-three US dollars), including in part the additional investments made by Azurix to finance ABA.*\n\n*6. To award interest compounded semi-annually on the amount referred to in paragraph 5 of this decision: (i) as from March 12, 2002 to June 30, 2006 at the rate of 2.44%, which is the average rate applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit during that period, and (ii) as from 60 days after the dispatch of this award to the parties until such amount has been fully paid at the average rate applicable to US six-month certificates of deposit.*\n\n*7. That each party shall be responsible for their own costs and counsel fees, and the Respondent shall bear the fees and expenses of the arbitrators and the costs of the ICSID Secretariat except for US$34,496 (thirty-four thousand four hundred ninety six U.S. dollars) which shall be borne by Claimant.*\n\n*8. That all other claims are dismissed.10*\n\n*Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, July 14, 2006 (the \"Award\") \u00b6 442.\n\n38.\n\nArgentina now asks the Committee to annul this Award.\n\n**C. The grounds for annulment**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n39.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*(a) that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*(b) that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*(c) that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n40.\n\nIn the present case, Argentina identifies a number of matters which it claims are grounds for annulment, relating to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdictional findings, to its findings relating to the applicable law, to its consideration of evidence, to the constitution of the Tribunal, as well as to the Tribunal\u2019s calculation of the damages. Argentina relies on four of the five grounds of annulment provided for in the ICSID Convention, namely those under sub-paragraphs (a), (b), (d) and (e) of Article 52(1).\n\n41.\n\nAn ICSID award is not subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in the ICSID Convention.11 In annulment proceedings under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, an *ad hoc* committee is thus not a court of appeal, and cannot consider the substance of the dispute,12 but can only determine whether the award should be annulled on one of the grounds in Article 52(1).13\n\nICSID Convention, Article 53(1).\n\n*Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, S.A.

Nor can it direct a Tribunal on a resubmission how it should resolve substantive issues in dispute. All it can do is annul the decision of the tribunal: it can extinguish a* res judicata *but on a question of merits it cannot create a new one.

As was stated by the *ad hoc* committees in the *Kl\u00f4ckner /* Annulment Decision and *CMS* Annulment Decision:\n\n*an arbitral tribunal\u2019s lack of jurisdiction, whether said to be partial or total, necessarily comes within the scope of an \"excess of powers\" under Article 52 (1)(b).15*\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner* Annulment Decision \u00b6 4.\n\n46.\n\nHowever, the ground of manifest excess of powers is not limited to lack of jurisdiction. This ground of annulment may also exist where the tribunal disregards the applicable law or bases the award on a law other than the applicable law under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention.16 As the *ad hoc* committee in the *CMS* Annulment Decision stated:\n\n*A complete failure to apply the law to which a Tribunal is directed by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention can also constitute a manifest excess of powers*.17\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner* Annulment Decision \u00b6 59; *MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6 5.03; *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 49; *Lucchetti* Annulment Decision \u00b6 98; *MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 44; *Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6 45.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 49.\n\n47.\n\nHowever, there is a distinction between *non-application* of the applicable law (which is a ground for annulment), and an *incorrect application* of the applicable law (which is not),18 although this is a distinction that may not always be easy to draw. In the *MINE* Annulment Decision it was said that:\n\n*Disregard of the applicable rules of law must be distinguished from erroneous application of those rules* *which, even if manifestly unwarranted, furnishes no ground for annulment.19*\n\nTo the same effect, in the *CMS* Annulment Decision, it was said that:\n\n*The Committee recalls, once more, that it has only a limited jurisdiction under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. In the circumstances, the Committee cannot simply substitute its own view of the law and its own appreciation of the facts for those of the Tribunal. Notwithstanding the identified errors and lacunas in the Award, it is the case in the end that the Tribunal applied Article XI of the Treaty. Although applying it cryptically and defectively, it applied it. There is accordingly no manifest excess of powers.20*\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6 5.04; *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 50-51 ; *Repsol YPF Ecuador S.A. v.

[u]nder Article 52(1)(d), the emphasis is clearly on the term \"rule of procedure,\" that is, on the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded, not on the content of its decision22*\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6 83.\n\n50.\n\nThe terms of Article 52(1)(d) indicate that, for this ground of annulment to be established, not only must the departure from the rule of procedure be \"serious\", but the rule of procedure in question must be \"fundamental\".23\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 5.05 and 5.06; *MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 49.\n\n51.\n\nIn the *Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision it was further stated that:\n\n*In order to be a \"serious\" departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from* *what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed24*\n\n*Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6 48.\n\n52.\n\nThis point was elaborated upon in the *MINE* Annulment Decision:\n\n*A first comment on this provision concerns the term \"serious\". In order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \"fundamental rule of procedure\" must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.*\n\n*A second comment concerns the term \"fundamental\": even a serious departure from a rule of procedure will not give rise to annulment, unless that rule is \"fundamental\". The Committee considers that a clear example of such a fundamental rule is to be found in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration which provides: \"The parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given full opportunity of presenting his case.\" The term \"fundamental rule of procedure\" is not to be understood as necessarily including all of the Arbitration Rules adopted by the Centre.25*\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 5.05-5.06.\n\n**(e) Failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e))**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nIt is generally accepted that this ground of annulment only applies in a clear case when there has been a failure by the tribunal to state any reasons, and not in a case where there has merely been a failure by the tribunal to state correct or convincing reasons. In the *MINE* Annulment Decision it was said that:\n\n*[T]he requirement that an award has to be motivated implies that it must enable the reader to follow the reasoning of the Tribunal on points of fact and law. It implies that, and only that. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of review under paragraph 1(e)...*\n\n*In the Committee's view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how* *the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.26*\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 5.08-5.09.\n\n54.\n\nSimilarly, in the *Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision the *ad hoc* committee considered that:\n\n*Neither Article 48(3) nor Article 52(1)(e) specify the manner in which the Tribunal\u2019s reasons are to be stated. The object of both provisions is to ensure that the Parties will be able to understand the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning. This goal does not require that each reason be stated expressly. The tribunal\u2019s reasons may be implicit in the considerations and conclusions contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used in the decision.27*\n\n*It is in the nature of this ground of annulment that in case the award suffers from a lack of reasons which can be challenged within the meaning and scope of Article 52(1)(e), the remedy need not be the annulment of the award. The purpose of this particular ground for annulment is not to have the award reversed on its merits. It is to allow the parties to understand the Tribunal\u2019s decision. If the award does not meet the minimal requirement as to the reasons given by the Tribunal, it does not necessarily need to be resubmitted to a new Tribunal. If the ad hoc committee so concludes, on the basis of the knowledge it has received upon the dispute, the reasons supporting the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions can be explained by the ad hoc Committee itself.28*\n\n*Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6 81.\n\n*Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6 83.\n\n55.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision added in this respect:\n\n*[I]t is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state any reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons.... Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must* *be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.*\n\n*In the Committee\u2019s view, annulment under Article (52)(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might.* *However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an* ad hoc *committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.29*\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n\n56.\n\nThus, in the *CMS* Annulment Decision, the *ad hoc* committee found that this ground of annulment had not been established because:\n\n*although the motivation of the Award could certainly have been clearer, a careful reader can follow the implicit reasoning of the Tribunal.30*\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6 127.\n\n**D. Derivative claims**\n------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n57.\n\nIn the course of the proceedings before the Tribunal relating to Argentina\u2019s challenge to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, Argentina raised an objection that Azurix had no standing to assert rights that arise from the Concession. Argentina argued, that because the Concession was a contract entered into between the Province and ABA, only ABA could assert rights under the Concession against the Province. Argentina claimed that Azurix, being only a shareholder of ABA, lacked *ius standi* to put forward \"indirect claims\" or \"derivative claims\" relating to ABA\u2019s contractual rights.\n\n58.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal considered that this objection to jurisdiction had been filed out of time as it was only raised in Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, it decided that the issues it raised were such that they should be considered at the Tribunal\u2019s own initiative under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41 (2).31\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 68.\n\n59.\n\nThe Tribunal found that, given the wide meaning of \"investment\" in the definition in Article 1.1(a) of the BIT, the provisions of the BIT protect indirect claims. The Tribunal further considered that this conclusion concurred with decisions of tribunals that have interpreted the same provision in the same BIT or similar provisions in other BITs to which Argentina is a party.32 The Tribunal affirmed the *ius standi* of Azurix in this case, finding that Azurix was the investor that made the investment through indirectly owned and controlled subsidiaries.33 The Tribunal therefore rejected the objection to jurisdiction.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 73.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 74.\n\n60.\n\nIn its Application for Annulment, Argentina contends that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, by exercising jurisdiction over Azurix\u2019s claim for damages, as all of Azurix\u2019s claims alleged interference by the Province with rights arising from or attaching to the Concession, to which ABA, and not Azurix, was the party. Argentina further contends that Azurix incurred its alleged losses only derivatively through its indirect participation in ABA, but the Tribunal allowed Azurix to recover damages equivalent to the fair market value of the Concession Agreement as if there were no corporate distinction between Azurix and ABA.34\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n61.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) The fact that the Tribunal had jurisdiction over Azurix does not mean that it had jurisdiction over any type of claim asserted by Azurix as a shareholder of ABA. While a shareholder with the requisite nationality has the capacity or standing of an investor under the treaty, there is an entirely different question concerning the scope of the claims that can be advanced by a shareholder as a shareholder.\n\n(b) The substantive rights that attach to shares in a company is a question that can only be resolved by the *lex societas,* since neither investment treaties nor international law in general say anything about the rights of shareholders.35 A fundamental characteristic of a corporation, which cannot be ignored in the investment treaty context, is that it is a legal entity separate from its shareholders, with rights and liabilities entirely distinct from theirs. A person does not have an individual cause of action against third parties for wrongs or injuries to a corporation in which he or she holds stock, even if the stockholders suffer harm from the damage to the corporation, such as a reduction in the value of his or her stock.\n\n(c) The Tribunal failed to distinguish between the procedural right of a shareholder to pursue an investment treaty claim and the substantive rights that might form the object of that claim, and failed to state reasons for its decision to extend the rights of Azurix as a shareholder beyond those recognised in the municipal legal system.\n\n(d) The rights of ABA under the Concession could not be a form of *\"any rights conferred by law or contract\u2019* for the purposes of Article 1(1)(a)(v) of the BIT, as a right arising out of a relationship to which Azurix is not privy, could not constitute an investment of Azurix.\n\n(e) Awards in other cases adopting the approach of allowing shareholders to bring indirect claims in respect of the diminution of the value of their shares, ignore the basic contours of the rights attaching to shares in all municipal legal systems. There is no doctrine of precedent in investment treaty arbitration and the Committee should decide this case on the basis of the force of the legal arguments deployed by each of the parties.\n\n(f) At the time of drafting of the ICSID Convention, drafters considered and rejected the possibility of granting a direct action to controlling shareholders of local companies. Instead, they included the possibility prescribed by Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, which ensures that damages are paid to the company rather than to the shareholders thereby protecting the rights of the company's creditors and other third parties, while also eliminating the possibility of the local company and its shareholders pursuing different claims in different *fora* in respect of the same damage. By virtue of Article 25(2)(b), if Azurix exercised control over ABA, it was obliged to bring claims under the BIT and the ICSID Convention in the name of ABA and for the account of ABA.36 The Tribunal's decision circumvents the requirements of Article 25(2)(b) and makes that provision pointless.\n\n(g) Where investment treaties do allow claims to be brought on behalf of a local company, they insist that the claim be brought in the local company's name and that any damages awarded be paid to the company and not to the controlling shareholder.37\n\n(h) If damages are payable to the shareholders directly, then (1) the rights of the company's creditors may be prejudiced if the company cannot pay its debts as they fall due, (2) the company is effectively absolved from the tax regime of the host state in relation to the damages paid by the state, (3) the shareholder can bypass the company\u2019s own governing bodies by pursuing a strategy that the company itself does not endorse and there is a risk of double recovery, and (4) in the case of a multinational company, a single measure of the host state causing prejudice to that company could potentially generate an endless number of claims from individual or corporate shareholders with different levels of direct or indirect control over the same investment for the same damage.\n\n(i) For the purposes of Article 1 of Protocol I to the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Court of Human Rights38 has held that, whenever a shareholder\u2019s interests are harmed by any measure directed at the company, it is up to the latter to take appropriate action.\n\n(j) Azurix\u2019s argument, that in pursuing its BIT claims it was in fact invoking its own rights rather than the rights of ABA, is sophistry as it relied on ABA's rights under the Concession.\n\n(k) This case is distinguishable from most other cases brought by shareholders against Argentina because ABA was in a position to bring a claim under Article 25(2)(b) in terms of the required foreign control, and because the reasoning of the Tribunal in certain parts of the Award\u2014such as the rejection of Azurix\u2019s claim under the umbrella clause\u2014is contradictory to the admission of Azurix\u2019s derivative claim.\n\nRelying on *Case concerning the Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain),* Second Phase, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1970, p. 3 *(\"Barcelona Traction* case\") \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\nReferring to Christoph Schreuer, The ICSID Convention: A Commentary, 291 (CUP 2001).\n\nCiting North American Free Trade Agreement, 32 I.L.M. 289 (1993) (table of contents, preamble, parts l-lll) and 32 I.L.M. 605 (1993) (parts IV-VII, annexes) (\"NAFTA\") Articles 1117 and 1135.\n\nThe first paragraph of Article 1 of Protocol I to the European Convention on Human Rights states that: \"Every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. No one shall be deprived of his possessions except in the public interest and subject to the conditions provided for by law and by the general principles of international law.\"\n\n62.\n\nAzurix argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) Argentina's argument ignores the very nature of the dispute before ICSID in which Azurix claimed that Argentina violated its obligations under the BIT. As required by Argentine law, Azurix invested in Argentina through ABA, and that investment was entirely lost because of the acts and omissions in Argentina in specific violation of the BIT.\n\n(b) The jurisdiction of ICSID is determined by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and is governed by the terms of the instrument expressing the parties consent to arbitration, which in the present case is the BIT.\n\n(c) Because Article 25 of the ICSID Convention did not define \"investment\", that task was left largely to the terms of bilateral investment treaties or other instruments on which jurisdiction is based. After considering the facts and weighing the evidence the Tribunal found that Azurix\u2019s investment satisfies the definition of \"investment\" in the Treaty, and that Azurix\u2019s claims arose \"directly from\" its investment in Argentina.\n\n(d) The Tribunal\u2019s decision is consistent with more than 14 other ICSID cases that have discussed this same issue and have unanimously found jurisdiction to exist in the same circumstances.39\n\n(e) The Tribunal did not override the principle of privity of contract by exerting jurisdiction. Instead it distinguished between claims for breach of contract and claims for violation of the BIT, and denied several of Azurix\u2019s claims because it considered them to be contractual claims.\n\n(f) The *Barcelona Traction* case has been distinguished by many previous ICSID cases, and no one arbitration panel has interpreted that case as holding that a foreign shareholder does not have the right to claim damages when its investment includes a domestic subsidiary, as is the case here.40 The *Barcelona Traction* case itself recognised the developments occurring in international law on investment protection, especially investment protection treaties, which may accord direct protection to shareholders.41\n\n(g) Argentina\u2019s acts and omissions may amount to both violations of the BIT for which Azurix can seek redress before ICSID and breaches of the Concession. Azurix is not barred from bringing its own claims simply because Argentina's acts and omissions also breached the Concession, and at least 10 other ICSID tribunals have rejected this argument of Argentina.42 It is inaccurate to refer to Azurix\u2019s claims as \"derivative claims\", as Azurix sought a remedy for the harm to its investment, not for ABA\u2019s breached contractual rights.\n\n(h) Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention is not applicable in the current case because ABA was not a party to the arbitration. Whether ABA can bring a claim under Article 25(2)(b) does not affect the right of action of foreign shareholders under the BIT in order to protect their own interests in the qualifying investment.\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Co. v.

It stated:\n\n*However, the requirement in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention is not only that the Tribunal has exceeded its powers but that it has done so \"manifestly\". From the writings of legal scholars it appears that there are divergent views on the impact of this additional requirement of \"manifestness\". On the one hand, the view has been expressed that where an ad hoc committee finds that a tribunal has wrongly either exercised or failed to exercise jurisdiction, the award should be annulled, wholly or partly, without any further examination of whether the excess was manifest. On the other hand, it has been held by others that there should be no annulment when the tribunal has wrongly assumed, or failed to assume, jurisdiction, but its decision on this point was tenable, since in such a case the tribunal would not have manifestly acted contrary to the BIT.45*\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee then went on to conclude as follows:\n\n*The Ad hoc Committee, for its part, attaches weight to the fact that the wording of Article 52(1)(b) is general and makes no exception for issues of jurisdiction. Moreover, a* *request for annulment is not an appeal, which means that there should not be a full review of the tribunal\u2019s award.* *One general purpose of Article 52, including its sub-paragraph (1)(b), must be that an annulment should not occur easily. From this perspective, the Committee considers that the word \"manifest\" should be given considerable weight also when matters of jurisdiction are concerned.*\n\n*... Bearing in mind the requirement of \"manifestness\", the Ad hoc Committee will now examine whether the Tribunal exceeded its powers and, in the affirmative, whether it did so to such an extent as to justify annulment.46*\n\n*Lucchetti* Annulment Decision \u00b6 100.\n\n*Lucchetti* Annulment Decision \u00b6 101-102\n\n66.\n\nIn the present case, the Committee agrees with the *ad hoc* committee in the *Lucchetti* Annulment Decision that the wording of Article 52(1)(b) is general and makes no exception for issues of jurisdiction. Thus, an award will only be annulled under that provision on grounds that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction or exceeded jurisdiction if the lack or excess of jurisdiction was manifest.\n\n67.\n\nArticle 41 (1) of the ICSID Convention provides that *\"[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence\".* As is clear from Article 41 (2), issues of whether the tribunal has \"competence\" include the question of whether the tribunal has jurisdiction. Thus, by virtue of Article 41, in cases where there is any uncertainty or doubt as to whether or not a tribunal has jurisdiction, that question falls to be settled by the tribunal itself in exercise of its *comp\u00e9tence-comp\u00e9tence* under that provision.\n\n68.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that Article 52(1)(b) does not provide a mechanism for *de novo* consideration of, or an appeal against, a decision of a tribunal under Article 41(1) after the tribunal has given its final award. The Committee is rather of the view that it is only where the tribunal has *manifestly* acted without jurisdiction that an *ad hoc* committee can intervene under Article 52(1)(b).47 The expression \"manifestly\" in Article 52(1)(b) means \"obvious\" rather than \"grave\", and the relevant test is thus whether the excess of power *\"can be discerned with little effort and without deeper analysis\"*,48 Thus, if it is obvious, without deeper analysis, that a tribunal lacked or exceeded jurisdiction, an *ad hoc* committee may annul the tribunal\u2019s award under Article 52(1)(b) at least to the extent of the lack or excess of jurisdiction. If, on the other hand, reasonable minds might differ as to whether or not the tribunal has jurisdiction, that issue falls to be resolved definitively by the tribunal in exercise of its power under Article 41 before the award is given, rather than by an *ad hoc* committee under Article 52(1)(b) after the award has been given.\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner* Annulment Decision \u00b6 4.\n\n*Repsol* Annulment Decision \u00b6 36 (citing other authorities): *\"It is generally understood that exceeding one\u2019s powers is \u2018manifest\u2019 when it is \u2018obvious by itself\u2019 simply by reading the Award, that is, even prior to a detailed examination of its contents\".* Compare *Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 38-40 (stating that *\"the excess of power should at once be textually obvious and substantively serious\"* (emphasis added)).\n\n69.\n\nIn these circumstances, even if it is subsequently seen to be arguable whether or not the tribunal\u2019s decision under Article 41 was correct, it cannot be said that the tribunal *manifestly* lacked jurisdiction, and there is no basis for an *ad hoc* committee in purported exercise of its power under Article 52(1)(b) to substitute its own decision for that of the tribunal. As the tribunal\u2019s decision under Article 41 must be treated as conclusive, in such a case there is also no occasion for an *ad hoc* committee to express its own view on whether or not the tribunal had jurisdiction.\n\n70.\n\nThe Committee now determines this ground of annulment in the light of these principles by reference to the claims made by Azurix, and determined by the Tribunal.\n\n**(d) Azurix\u2019s claims and the Tribunal\u2019s findings**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nFirst, Azurix claimed that its investment had been expropriated as a result of *\"measures tantamount to expropriation\"* taken by the Province, contrary to Article IV(1) of the BIT. In respect of this claim, the Tribunal found that a breach of *contract* by a State or one of its instrumentalities will not amount to a breach of a *treaty* unless it be proved that the State or its emanation has gone beyond its role as a mere party to the contract, and has exercised the specific functions of a sovereign.49 The Tribunal rejected the claim, and found that in this case the impact on the investment attributable to the Province\u2019s actions did not amount to an expropriation because Azurix did not lose the attributes of ownership. At all times it continued to control ABA and its ownership of 90% of the shares was unaffected.50\n\nAward \u00b6 315.\n\nAward \u00b6 322.\n\n72.\n\nSecondly, Azurix claimed that Argentina was in breach of the obligation in Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT,51 which provides that an *\"[I]nvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment\u2019.* The Tribunal found that impugned actions of the Province reflected \"a *pervasive conduct of the Province in breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment\u2019,*52 hence Argentina was found in breach of this obligation.53\n\nAward \u00b6 330.\n\nAward \u00b6 377.\n\nAward \u00b6 442.\n\n73.\n\nThirdly, Azurix claimed that the Province and Argentina failed to observe their obligations under Article ll(2)(c) of the BIT (the \"umbrella clause\"),54 which provides that *\"[e]ach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\".* In respect of this claim, the Tribunal found that there was no relevant contract between Azurix and Argentina, and that while Azurix may submit a claim under the BIT for breaches by Argentina, there was no undertaking to be honoured by Argentina to Azurix other than the obligations under the BIT,55 and that accordingly there was no breach of the umbrella clause in the BIT.56\n\nAward \u00b6 379.\n\nAward \u00b6 384.\n\nImplied in Award \u00b6 384.\n\n74.\n\nFourthly, Azurix claimed that the Province failed to observe its obligations under Article ll(2)(b) of the BIT,57 which provides that *\"[n]either Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures the management,* *operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments\".* In respect of this claim, the Tribunal found that various actions of the provincial authorities were arbitrary actions without basis under the law or the Concession Agreement and impaired the operation of Azurix\u2019s investment;58 and that Argentina was therefore in breach of this obligation.\n\nAward \u00b6 386.\n\nAward \u00b6 393.\n\n75.\n\nFifthly, Azurix claimed that the Province and Argentina failed to observe their obligations under Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT,59 which provides that *\"[I]nvestment shall enjoy full protection and security.* In respect of this claim, the Tribunal found that Argentina, having failed to provide fair and equitable treatment to the investment, also breached the standard of full protection and security under the BIT.60\n\nAward \u00b6 396.\n\nAward \u00b6 408.\n\n**(e) The Committee\u2019s views**\n-----------------------------\n\n***(i) Introduction***\n----------------------\n\n76.\n\nAccording to Argentina, it is a general principle that:\n\n*A person does not have an individual cause of action against third parties for wrongs or injuries to a corporation in which he or she holds stock, even if the stockholders suffer harm from the damage to the corporation, such as a reduction in the value of his or her stock.*\n\nArgentina contends that, as all of Azurix\u2019s claims alleged interference by the Province with rights arising from or attaching to the Concession, to which ABA and not Azurix was the party, Azurix lacked *ius standi* to bring these claims.\n\n77.\n\nOn this ground, the Committee regards it as necessary to distinguish between two separate issues.\n\n78.\n\nThe first issue concerns the extent of the substantive protections afforded by the investment protection treaty. Even if a shareholder in a company is an \"investor\" for the purposes of the investment protection treaty, and even if the shareholder\u2019s interest in the company amounts to an \"investment\" for the purposes of the treaty, the substantive protections afforded by the treaty may not extend to protecting that investment against conduct causing harm to the company, as opposed to conduct causing harm to the shareholder directly. Regardless of any question of *ius standi,* in that event any claim by the shareholder alleging a breach of the treaty in respect of the shareholder\u2019s investment caused by a wrong or injury to the company would fail on its merits. On the other hand, the claim might well succeed on the merits if the treaty also conferred protections on the investment of the company itself (for instance because the company, although locally incorporated, is deemed to be a foreign investor because of its foreign control).\n\n79.\n\nThe second issue concerns the *ius standi* of a particular claimant to bring a particular claim. In the example just given, questions of *ius standi* might include whether the shareholder has *ius standi* to bring a claim alleging violations of the treaty in respect of the shareholder\u2019s own investment, whether the shareholder has *ius standi* to bring a claim alleging violations of the treaty in respect of the investment of the company as opposed to that of the shareholder, and whether the company has *ius standi* to bring a claim alleging violations of the treaty in respect of the company\u2019s investment.\n\n80.\n\nIn the present case, Azurix did not seek to bring a claim on behalf of ABA or in respect of alleged violations of rights of ABA. Rather, each of Azurix\u2019s claims alleged violations of the BIT in respect of what Azurix claimed was, for the purposes of the BIT, Azurix\u2019s own investment. The Committee therefore considers that no issue arose in this case as to the *ius standi* of Azurix to bring a claim on ABA\u2019s behalf or in respect of ABA\u2019s rights. Rather, the issue was whether Azurix had *ius standi* to bring a claim alleging a violation of the BIT in respect of Azurix\u2019s own investment and, if so, whether, in the circumstances of the case the provisions of the BIT had been violated in respect of Azurix\u2019s investment.\n\n81.\n\nThe resolution of these issues is a matter of interpretation and application of the relevant provisions of the BIT and ICSID Convention. It is the BIT which determines which particular kinds of interests are protected, and it is the BIT and ICSID Convention which determine the persons who may bring proceedings in respect of an alleged violation of the BIT in respect of a particular protected investment. While certain provisions or formulations may be commonly used in different investment protection treaties, each treaty must be applied according to its own specific terms.\n\n82.\n\nAs indicated in paragraphs 41-42 above, it is not the Committee\u2019s function to reach its own conclusion on the correct interpretation of the BIT and ICSID Convention in respect of these questions. That is the function of the Tribunal. Here the task of the Committee is confined to determining whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in reaching the conclusion that it did. In addressing this question, the Committee must itself consider the terms of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n***(ii) The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nThe relevant BIT and the ICSID Convention fall to be interpreted in accordance with the principles articulated in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"Vienna Convention\"),61 which reflect the customary international law rules of treaty interpretation as they already existed at the time that the text of the ICSID Convention and the BIT were adopted.62 Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention state:\n\n*Article 31*  \n*General rule of interpretation*\n\n*1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.*\n\n*2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:*\n\n*(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty;*\n\n*(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.*\n\n*3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:*\n\n*(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;*\n\n*(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;*\n\n*(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.*\n\n*4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.*\n\n*Article 32*  \n*Supplementary means of interpretation*\n\n*Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:*\n\n*(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or*\n\n*(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.*\n\nVienna, May 23, 1969; 1155 U.N.T.S. 331.\n\n*E.g.,* *Sovereignty over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia/Malaysia), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2002,* p. 625, at pp. 645-646, \u00b6 37.\n\n84.\n\nArticle 32 of the Vienna Convention demands that the Committee determine the interpretation resulting from the application of Article 31 before considering the potential application of Article 32.\n\n***(iii) The principles in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n85.\n\nThe parties have not referred to any relevant agreement or instrument of the kind referred to in Article 31(2) of the Vienna Convention, nor any \"subsequent practice\" of the kind referred to in Article 3l(3)(b) that would establish an agreed interpretation of the BIT between Argentina and the United States of America. Nor have the parties referred the Committee to any agreement or rules of international law of the kind referred to in Article 31 (3)(a) and (c), other than the BIT and the ICSID Convention, and general principles of customary international law.\n\n86.\n\nArgentina argues that the relevant provisions of the BIT and ICSID Convention must be read in the light of general principles of customary international law under which the distinction in municipal law between the rights of a company and those of its shareholders is transposed onto the international plane. Argentina relies in support of this argument on the *Barcelona Traction* case, in which the ICJ said that:\n\n*If the Court were to decide the case in disregard of the relevant institutions of municipal law it would, without justification, invite serious legal difficulties. It would lose touch with reality, for there are no corresponding institutions of international law to which the Court could resort. Thus the Court has, as indicated, not only to take cognizance of municipal law but also to refer to it.63*\n\nThe ICJ thus observed that, because a corporation has a legal personality separate from that of its shareholders:\n\n*... whenever a shareholder's interests are harmed by an act done to the company, it is to the latter that he must look to institute appropriate action; for although two separate entities may have suffered from the same wrong, it is only one entity whose rights have been infringed64*\n\nIn the context of ICSID proceedings, Argentina takes the position that a shareholder cannot bring a claim in respect of harm done to a company merely because the shareholder has been prejudiced through a diminution in the value of the shares.\n\n*Barcelona Traction* case \u00b6 50.\n\n*Barcelona Traction* case \u00b6 44.\n\n87.\n\nIn this regard the Committee notes that the *Barcelona Traction* case concerned customary international law rules of diplomatic protection rather than investment treaty arbitration. The ICJ held that in the field of diplomatic protection the general rule is that, in cases of an unlawful act committed against a company, only the national State of the company is authorised to make a claim, and not the national State of the shareholders.65 However, the ICJ recognised in that case, as well as in the subsequent *Diallo* case,66 that this general rule of international law may be subject to possible exceptions.67 Furthermore, the ICJ indicated in the *Barcelona Traction* case that this general rule of international law was applicable *\"in the absence of any treaty on the subject between the Parties\"68* It thereby acknowledged that the general rule can be modified by treaty provisions. The ICJ stated that:\n\n*... Thus, in the present state of the law, the protection of shareholders requires that recourse be had to treaty stipulations or special agreements directly concluded between the private investor and the State in which the investment is placed. States ever more frequently provide for such protection, in both bilateral and multilateral relations, either by means of special* *instruments or within the framework of wider economic arrangements. Indeed, whether in the form of unilateral or bilateral treaties between States, or in that of agreements between States and companies, there has since the Second World War been considerable development in the protection of foreign investments.* *The instruments in question contain provisions as to jurisdiction and procedure in case of disputes concerning the treatment of investing companies by the States in which they invest capital. Sometimes companies are themselves vested with a direct right to defend their interests against States through prescribed procedures.69*\n\n*Barcelona Traction* case \u00b6 88.\n\n*Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v. Democratic Republic of the Congo),* Preliminary Objections Judgment, I.C.J., 24 May 2OO7(the *\"Diallo* case\").\n\n*Barcelona Traction* case \u00b6\u00b6 65-66, 92; *Diallo* case \u00b6 91.\n\n*Barcelona Traction* case \u00b6 36.\n\n*Barcelona Traction* case \u00b6 89-90.\n\n88.\n\nSimilarly, in the *Diallo* case the ICJ said that:\n\n*... in contemporary international law, the protection of the rights of companies and the rights of their shareholders, and the settlement of the associated disputes, are essentially governed by bilateral or multilateral agreements for the protection of foreign investments, such as the treaties for the promotion and protection of foreign investments, and the Washington Convention of 18 March 1965 on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which created an International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), and also by contracts between States and foreign investors. In that context, the role of diplomatic protection somewhat faded, as in practice recourse is only made to it in rare cases where treaty r\u00e9gimes do not exist or have proved inoperative.70*\n\n*Diallo* case \u00b6 88.\n\n89.\n\nAs an example, a treaty could provide for the possibility of diplomatic protection of shareholders by their national State in respect of an injury to a company having the nationality of another State and thereby modify the otherwise applicable rule of customary international law. Similarly, a treaty might provide for a company to bring arbitration proceedings directly against the host State in the event of an injury to the company by the host State. For instance, in the event of an injury to the company, a treaty might enable shareholders to bring arbitration proceedings directly against the host State.\n\n90.\n\nThe Committee accepts that a treaty may need to be interpreted against the general fabric of customary international law. However, except where norms of *ius cogens* are involved, a treaty is capable of modifying the rules of customary international law that would otherwise be applicable as between the States parties to the treaty. Indeed, often the very purpose of a treaty is to effect such a modification. The purpose of investment protection treaties is generally is to augment or modify the customary international law procedures for protection of foreign investors. Hence the starting point in determining the effect of the treaty is the terms of the treaty itself, rather than the principles of customary international law that may or may not be displaced by the treaty provisions.\n\n91.\n\nHere the BIT confers specific protections on \"investments\". Article 1(1)(a) clarifies that the investments protected by the BIT are those in the territory of one party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the other party. It is not disputed that Azurix is a company of the United States of America, and it follows that, according to its terms, the protections accorded by the BIT apply to every investment in Argentina that is *\"owned or controlled directly or indirectly* by Azurix. The term \"investment\" is defined very broadly in Article 1(1)(a) as *\"every kind of investment\u2019.* The words *\"includes without limitation\"* in the chapeau of that provision indicate that the list in that provision of types of investment is non-exhaustive. Types of investment in that list include not only *\"shares of stock... in a company,* but also \"a *company* itself, as well as any *\"other interest in a company,* or even any *\"interests in the assets thereof\u2019.* Other types of investment listed include *\"tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges\"* (Article 1(1)(a)(i)); \"a *claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value and directly related to an investment\u2019* (Article 1(1)(a)(iii)); and *\"any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits pursuant to law\"* (Article 1(1)(a)(v)).\n\n92.\n\nAzurix claimed in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction that its investment in Argentina consisted of *\"Azurix\u2019s payment of its US$438.6 million canon (which constitutes invested capital), its ownership interest and investment in ABA, and the rights in the Concession Agreement\u2019,71*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 59, referring to Azurix\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction \u00b6 6(ii).\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal found that:\n\n*Azurix made an investment by paying a \"canon\" to obtain the concession to provide water and wastewater services to the Province. To carry out the investment, Azurix organized several subsidiaries, as required by the Bidding Terms, and established a locally registered company in Argentina, ABA.72*\n\nThe Tribunal ultimately concluded that:\n\n*The Tribunal is satisfied that the investment described by Claimant in its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction is an investment protected under the terms of the BIT and the Convention:*\n\n*(a) Azurix indirectly owns 90% of the shareholding in ABA,*\n\n*(b) Azurix indirectly controls ABA, and (c) ABA is party to the Concession Agreement and was established for the specific purpose of signing the Concession Agreement as required by the Bidding Terms.73*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 64 (footnotes omitted).\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 65.\n\n94.\n\nIn its ordinary meaning, the wording of Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT embraces that ABA itself would be an \"investment\" of Azurix for purposes of the BIT, since ABA is a company (Article 1(1)(a)(iii)) owned and controlled directly or indirectly by Azurix (Article 1(1)(a), chapeau). Although assets of ABA would as a matter of law belong to ABA and not to Azurix, Azurix nonetheless had, by virtue of its controlling shareholding in ABA, *\"interests in the assets\"* of ABA (Article 1(1)(a)(ii)), and through that shareholding indirectly controlled those assets (Article 1(1)(a), chapeau). Assets of Azurix would also be an \"investment\" of Azurix for the purposes of the BIT. Additionally, the legal and contractual rights of ABA (Article 1(1)(a)(v)), including the rights of ABA under the Concession, being indirectly controlled by Azurix through its majority shareholding in ABA (Article 1(1)(a), chapeau), would similarly be \"investments\" of Azurix for the purposes of the BIT. Contrary to what Argentina seeks to argue, the Committee considers that there is nothing in the wording of Article 1(1)(a) that would suggest that it is only Azurix\u2019s legal rights as a shareholder in ABA that are protected.\n\n95.\n\nBy reference to the wide terms of Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT the Committee does not consider the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion as to the definition of Azurix\u2019s investment to be manifestly inconsistent with an interpretation of the BIT made in accordance with the principle in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n96.\n\nAs to the *ius standi* of Azurix to bring the proceedings in this case, the Tribunal ultimately found as follows:\n\n*We conclude the discussion on ius standi by affirming the ius standi of Azurix in these proceedings: Azurix is the investor that made the investment through indirectly owned and controlled subsidiaries74*\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 74.\n\n97.\n\nThe Committee notes that none of the critical documents governing the jurisdiction of the Tribunal (the BIT, the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Arbitration Rules) expressly addresses the issue of who has *ius standi* to bring investor-host State arbitration proceedings pursuant to those treaties. However, Article Vll(1) of the BIT defines an \"investment dispute\" for the purposes of that provision as including:\n\n... a *dispute between a Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to... (c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.*\n\nIn this case there was clearly a dispute between Azurix and Argentina, and that dispute concerned an alleged breach of rights conferred by the BIT with respect to what the Tribunal found was, for the purposes of the BIT, an investment of Azurix. In its ordinary meaning, here there was an investment dispute between Azurix and Argentina.\n\n98.\n\nParagraphs (2) and (3) of Article VII then provide for the possibility of *\"the national or company concerned\u2019* to choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding arbitration to ICSID. The reference to *\"the national or company concerned\"* logically means Azurix, as the party to the *\"investment dispute\"* with Argentina. The Committee concludes that the ordinary meaning of these words enable Azurix to bring these proceedings. Indeed, it seems logical that Azurix would have *ius standi* to bring a claim alleging violations of the BIT in respect of what is, for the purposes of the BIT, Azurix\u2019s own investment.\n\n99.\n\nHowever, Argentina argues that paragraphs (1) to (3) of Article VII of the BIT are to be read in the context of Article Vll(8) of the BIT and Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Article Vll(8) of the BIT provides that:\n\n*For purposes of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article* [dealing with investor-host State arbitration], *any company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party or a political subdivision thereof but that, immediately before the occurrence of the event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such other Party in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.*\n\nArticle 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention provides that in Article 25, the expression *\"National of another Contracting State\"* includes:\n\n*... any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purposes of this Convention.*\n\n100.\n\nArgentina argues that, by virtue of these provisions, Azurix is not entitled to bring ICSID proceedings in respect of alleged violations of the Concession, to which ABA and not Azurix is a party, and that only ABA could be entitled to do so.\n\n101.\n\nThe Committee agrees that the effect of these provisions is to treat ABA as a national of the United States of America for purposes of the investor-host State arbitration clause in Article VII the BIT and for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Although the Committee notes that Argentina\u2019s position is that ABA could not have so invoked those provisions because of a waiver provision in the Concession, these provisions appear to give ABA the capacity to bring ICSID proceedings in respect of alleged violations of the BIT with respect to the Concession.\n\n102.\n\nHere the Committee finds that it is not called upon in this case to decide whether or not ABA could in practice have brought ICSID arbitration proceedings under Article Vll(8) of the BIT and Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Although these provisions establish a possibility in certain circumstances for a company incorporated in the host State to bring proceedings against the host State for violations of the BIT, there is nothing in the wording of these provisions that derogates from any right that the shareholders in the company might otherwise have to bring proceedings under Article VII of the BIT. Similarly there is nothing in the wording of any other provision of the BIT or the ICSID Convention to suggest that any right that a person might otherwise have to bring proceedings is in some way limited by or subject to Article Vll(8) of the BIT or Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n103.\n\nFor these reasons the Committee does not consider the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion as to Azurix\u2019s *ius standi* to be manifestly inconsistent with an interpretation of the BIT and the ICSID Convention in accordance with the principle in Article 31 (1) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n104.\n\nAs to the merits of the case, the Tribunal rejected the first and third of Azurix\u2019s claims on the basis that Azurix had established no relevant breach of the BIT.75 In particular, in respect of Azurix\u2019s third claim, the Tribunal found that there had been no breach of the \"umbrella clause\" of the BIT with respect to Azurix\u2019s investment, given that Azurix was not a party to the Concession.76 The Tribunal also found that certain matters did not constitute breaches of the BIT as they were purely contractual matters.77 However, the Tribunal upheld Azurix\u2019s other claims, having found that there had been breaches of the BIT for which Argentina was responsible in respect of Azurix\u2019s investment.78\n\nSee paragraphs 71 and 73 above.\n\nSee paragraphs 73 above.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 150, 155, 160.\n\nSee paragraphs 72, 74-75 above.\n\n105.\n\nOn this issue, the Committee considers that if ABA itself is an investment of Azurix for the purposes of the BIT, it follows that conduct towards ABA also will be characterised as conduct towards an investment of Azurix. Thus, for instance, a failure to afford fair and equitable treatment to ABA would be a failure to afford fair and equitable treatment to an investment of Azurix.\n\n106.\n\nArgentina argues that this interpretation, which would enable Azurix to bring ICSID proceedings alleging violations of the BIT in respect of assets belonging to ABA and not to Azurix, and in respect of the Concession to which ABA and not Azurix is a party, ignores the separate legal personalities of Azurix and ABA and the fundamental distinction that exists in municipal law between the rights of the company and those of its shareholders. Argentina argues that no legal system can tolerate a situation whereby two entities have precisely the same rights over the same thing.\n\n107.\n\nThe Committee does not accept that this is the result of the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation. In this respect, an analogy might be drawn with contracts of insurance. Although only one person may be the legal owner of an item of property, there may be others who would suffer financial loss if the property were damaged or destroyed, and who are therefore entitled to insure that property. In many cases, such others may be persons having some direct or indirect legal interest in the property falling short of legal title, such as a beneficial owner, a lessor or mortgagor. However, in some legal systems it may also be possible for a person having no direct or indirect legal interest in the property to insure it simply on the basis that that person would suffer a financial loss if the property was damaged or destroyed. If all such persons separately insured the same property, this would not mean that all of them thereby have become the legal owners of the property, or that all of them have the same legal rights in the same thing. In the event that the property is lost or destroyed, it may be possible for all such persons to make insurance claims, although each may ultimately only be entitled to be compensated to the extent of their own pecuniary loss rather than for the full value of the property.\n\n108.\n\nIn the same way, the Committee considers that, even where a foreign investor is not the actual legal owner of the assets constituting an investment, or not an actual party to the contract giving rise to the contractual rights constituting an investment, that foreign investor may nonetheless have a financial or other commercial interest in that investment. This is so, irrespective of whether the actual legal owner of the assets or contractual rights constituting the investment is a wholly or partly owned subsidiary of the investor, or whether the actual legal owner is an unrelated third party. The Committee sees no reason in principle why an investment protection treaty cannot protect such an interest of a foreign investor, and enable the foreign investor to bring arbitration proceedings in respect of alleged violations of the treaty with respect to that interest. An investment protection treaty having this effect does not alter the legal nature of the investor\u2019s interest nor that of the legal owner of the investment, nor does it ignore the separate legal personalities and separate legal rights and obligations of the shareholder and the company. Rather, it merely ensures that whatever interest, legal or otherwise, that the investor does have will be accorded certain protections.\n\n109.\n\nWhere this occurs, conduct which violates the treaty in respect of the investor\u2019s investment may also violate the rights of the legal owner under municipal law and/or under the same or a different investment protection treaty. This is so irrespective of whether the actual legal owner of the assets or contractual rights constituting the investment is a wholly or partly owned subsidiary of the investor, or an unrelated third party. In such circumstances the Committee perceives that there is no reason why a treaty cannot permit the investor to bring a claim under the treaty in respect of its own interest directly protected by the treaty, whether or not the legal owner of the rights constituting the investment may simultaneously be able to bring proceedings in respect of its own rights before the domestic courts or a different arbitration tribunal. Although more than one person may be able to claim in different *fora* in respect of the same damage to the same assets, each may ultimately only be entitled to be compensated to the extent of its own loss.\n\n110.\n\nHere the BIT confers certain protections on certain investments of Azurix as defined in the treaty and permits Azurix to bring ICSID proceedings in respect of alleged violations of the BIT in respect of such investments. The arguments of Argentina effectively seek to insert a proviso into the wording of the BIT to the effect that an investor may bring proceedings for an alleged violation of the BIT with respect to the investor\u2019s investment *\"except where the investment is a company and the alleged violation of the BIT consists of an alleged injury to the company or to assets or rights which are legally owned by the company rather than the investor\".* No such wording is apparent in the terms of the BIT, and the Committee would see such an exception as inconsistent with the broad definition of \"investment\" in Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT.\n\n111.\n\nFor these reasons the Committee does not accept that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusions with respect to the *ius standi* issue are manifestly inconsistent with an interpretation of the BIT and the ICSID Convention in accordance with the principle in Article 31 (1) of the Vienna Convention.\n\n***(iv) Article 32 of the Vienna Convention***\n----------------------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe Committee does not consider the provisions of Article Vll(8) of the BIT and Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention to be ambiguous or obscure. However, Argentina in effect argues that the interpretation referred to above leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n113.\n\nFirst, Argentina claims that if damages in respect of an injury to a company are payable to the shareholders directly, then the rights of the company\u2019s creditors may be prejudiced if the company cannot pay its debts as they fall due. In addition, according to Argentina, if the State pays damages directly to the shareholders, the company is effectively absolved from the tax regime of the host State in relation to such damages. Argentina also argues that there is a danger of double recovery if both the host State and a shareholder, and possibly several different shareholders, are able to bring separate proceedings in respect of the same injury to the company.\n\n114.\n\nThe Committee considers that while there may be unresolved problems in relation to the possibility of multiple proceedings, double recovery and the extent to which minority shareholders should be compensated if the local company remains a going concern, this in itself does not make the interpretation of the BIT referred to above \"ambiguous or obscure\" or \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable\" within the meaning of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention. In the present case, Azurix is in the not unusual position of a foreign investor incorporating a subsidiary in the host State through which the investment is made. That investment was found by the Tribunal to have been rendered worthless by action for which the host State was found to be responsible. The need to protect foreign investors in Azurix\u2019s position was one of the main reasons why investment protection treaties and ICSID itself have been adopted. As the problems identified by Argentina appear to be hypothetical in the present case, the Committee finds that it does not need to address them.\n\n115.\n\nA further issue raised by Argentina is that, if both the host State and a shareholder are able to bring separate proceedings in respect of the same injury to the company, this could lead to an endless number of claims *\"creating general chaos in the form of multiple proceedings by shareholders in the company with the inevitable risk of double recovery\u2019,* with *\"disastrous consequences for the sustainability of the system of investment treaty arbitration\".* Argentina points out that Azurix owns ABA indirectly through several other corporate layers and argues that other companies in this layer might similarly have brought a claim in respect of the same subject-matter. Argentina also argues that, where one or more shareholders bring proceedings in respect of an injury to a company, and especially where the company in addition also brings proceedings in its own name, the various courts and tribunals may not take the same approach to the assessment of damages, and that it would be difficult to ensure that each claimant in each proceedings recovers only for that claimant\u2019s actual loss. Argentina contends that Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention was included to avoid this problem.\n\n116.\n\nOn the basis of the material before it the Committee is not satisfied that this is the purpose and effect of Article 25(2)(b). There have been examples of such multiple claims in practice,79 and it has not been demonstrated by Argentina that any real risk of *\"general chaos\"* or *\"disastrous consequences\"* has emerged. Indeed to the contrary: tribunals have repeatedly pointed out that mechanisms exist in international law for preventing double recovery.80 Although Argentina criticises such statements, the Committee does not consider that the hypothetical possibilities raised suffice to conclude that this particular interpretation of a treaty leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\nSee in particular *Ronald S.

Whilst the Committee acknowleged such a possibility, in that event the tribunal would only award the shareholder damages for the shareholder\u2019s own loss and the amount of any settlement reached by the company would be a matter to which the tribunal would have regard in assessing such damages. Again, the Committee does not consider that Argentina has demonstrated the existence of any real problem in practice in this respect.\n\n118.\n\nA further matter raised by Argentina is that if a shareholder brings ICSID proceedings and recovers damages, there is no way of ensuring that the compensation received by the shareholder is applied for the benefit of the company. Argentina suggests that any compensation received by a shareholder should be applied for the benefit of the company, as is the case under the NAFTA Treaty.81\n\nRelying on NAFTA Articles 1117 and 1135.\n\n119.\n\nThe Committee is not persuaded that as a matter of principle any compensation received by the shareholder should be applied for the benefit of the company. As the Committee has already observed, Azurix is a foreign investor that has incorporated a subsidiary in the host State through which the investment is made, and that investment of Azurix was found to have been rendered worthless by action for which the host State was found to be responsible. As a matter of principle, compensation for such loss should be paid to Azurix.\n\n120.\n\nArgentina then argues that to allow a shareholder to bring ICSID proceedings in respect of an injury to a company would enable the shareholder to circumvent an exclusive choice of forum clause in a contract between the host State and the company. Here Argentina argues that, in a clause of the Concession entered into between ABA and Argentina, ABA waived recourse to international arbitration and provided for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Argentine courts. However, successful recourse to the national courts by a company would not necessarily prevent the shareholder from subsequently bringing ICSID proceedings alleging that its loss as a result of the breach of the treaty has not been fully compensated, notwithstanding the amounts recovered by the company in proceedings before the national courts. Again, the Committee does not consider that this possibility is to be regarded as a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\n\n121.\n\nFor these reasons the Committee is not satisfied that the interpretation of the BIT and ICSID Convention that results from the application of the principle in Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention is to be regarded as leading to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. Hence the Committee is not required to have recourse to supplementary means of interpretation under Article 32 of the Vienna Convention.\n\n122.\n\nNevertheless, having regard to the extensive arguments made by the parties, the Committee does also consider whether recourse to such supplementary means of interpretation would mandate any different conclusion to that reached above. In this regard, the supplementary means of interpretation to which the Committee has been referred include case law, writings of publicists and preparatory work to the ICSID Convention.\n\n123.\n\nAs to other case-law, Azurix relies on some 14 arbitral decisions in which it says that ICSID tribunals have allowed shareholders to claim under an investment protection treaty in respect of an injury to a company in which they were shareholders.82\n\nAzurix refers to *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 68-76; *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v The Kingdom of Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/997/7, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, Jan. 25, 2000 *(\u2018Maffezini* Jurisdiction Decision\") \u00b6\u00b6 65-70; *Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 46-50; *LG&E* Jurisdiction Decision \u00b6\u00b6 50, 63; *American Manufacturing & Trading, Inc. v.

Schlemmer, Investment, Investor, Nationality, and Shareholders, in Peter Muchlinski, Federico Ortino and Christoph Schreuer [Eds.], The Oxford Handbook of International Investment Law (OUP 2008), at 81-86; Ian Laird, A Community of Destiny - The *Barcelona Traction* case and the Development of Shareholder Rights to Bring Investment Claims, in Todd Weiler [Ed.] International Investment Law and Arbitration, (Cameron May 2005) at 77-96.\n\n127.\n\nAs to the preparatory work to the ICSID Convention, Argentina argues that, at the time of drafting of the ICSID Convention, drafters considered and rejected the possibility of granting a direct action to controlling shareholders of local companies and instead included the possibility prescribed by Article 25(2)(b). In this regard the Committee is not satisfied that it has been established from the preparatory work that the inclusion of Article 25(2)(b) in the ICSID Convention was intended to preclude the possibility of a shareholder bringing proceedings in respect of a violation of an investment protection treaty in respect of the shareholder\u2019s own investment, merely because the investment consisted of the shareholder\u2019s participation in a company which might potentially instead have brought proceedings in its own name pursuant to Article 25(2)(b).\n\n128.\n\nArgentina also has referred by analogy to the European Convention on Human Rights and NAFTA. As the extent of the protections afforded by an investment protection treaty depends in each case on the specific terms of the treaty in question, the Committee regards comparisons with differently-worded treaties as of limited utility, especially treaties outside the field of investment protection. It is noted that the European Court of Human Rights has held that (subject to possible exceptions) a shareholder in a company does not have standing to bring a claim for a violation of the company\u2019s right\u2019s under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and that the mere fact that there has been a violation of the company\u2019s right\u2019s under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, does not of itself mean that there has been a violation of the shareholder\u2019s rights under that provision.84 However, such an approach does not inform the situation where a law or treaty might confer certain rights directly on a shareholder which would be violated by an injury to the company, or answer the question whether the shareholder could have standing to bring a claim in that event.\n\nOn shareholder rights under ECHR law in general see: *Agrotexim Hellas SA and Others v Greece* A 330 (1995); (1996) 21 EHRR 250; *Association and H v Austria* (1984) 36 DR 187 at 191-2; *Matos e Silva Lda and Others v Portugual* 1996-1V 1092; (1997) 24 EHRR 573; *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Colas Est et autres v France* 2002-III 421; *Autronic AG v Switzerland* A 178 (1990); (1990) 12 EHRR 485; *Demuth v Switzerland* 2002-IX 704; (2004) 38 EHRR 20; *Comingersoll SA v Portugal* 2000-IV 355; (2001) 31 EHRR 772.

The Committee rejects this ground of annulment.\n\n**E. Applicable law**\n---------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n131.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention provides that:\n\n*The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.*\n\n132.\n\nArgentina claims that the Tribunal failed to apply the law of Argentina to disputed issues arising out of the Concession Agreement, as expressly required by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. Instead, Argentina says that the Tribunal considered that its inquiry was governed *\"by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international lav/\u2019,* and that the Tribunal determined the disputed issues arising out of the Concession Agreement on the basis that they were of a *\"factual nature\u2019\u2019.* Argentina seeks annulment of the Award on the basis that, in failing to apply the law of Argentina to disputed issues arising out of the Concession Agreement, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.85\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 16-18.\n\n133.\n\nArgentina further claims that the Tribunal expressed contradictory reasons with respect to the law applicable to disputed issues arising out of the Concession Agreement, which were critical to its findings of liability against Argentina. Argentina maintains that on the one hand the Tribunal stated that the law of Argentina was *\"helpful in the carrying out of the Tribunal\u2019s enquir\u00ff\u2019* but that the Tribunal also characterised the issues arising out of the Concession Agreement as factual issues, and dealt with Argentine law in a part of the Award headed \"The Facts\". Argentina further seeks annulment of the Award on the ground that by issuing such contradictory reasons with respect to the applicable law the Tribunal failed to state the reasons on which the Award was based, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.86\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6 30.\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n*In relation to the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention*\n\n(a) It is a settled principle that a tribunal\u2019s application of the wrong law is an excess of authority and a ground for annulment.87\n\n(b) As the parties did not agree on the applicable law, the Tribunal was obliged, in accordance with Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, to apply Argentine law and international law *\"as may be applicable\"88* Despite this obligation, the Tribunal concluded that *\"the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry is governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law\"89*\n\n(c) Although the Tribunal stated that it did not completely discard Argentine law, insofar as *\"the law of Argentina should be helpful in the carrying* *out of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement to which Argentina\u2019s law applies\",90* the Tribunal stated that this inquiry should be limited because of *\"the treaty nature of the claims under consideration\"*,91 The Tribunal thereby disregarded Argentine law in deciding the controversy since although it found that Argentine law may be used to inquire into the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement, it also found that such breaches of the Concession Agreement were not part of the *\"claims under consideration\".* As such, Argentine law was not considered by the Tribunal to be law applicable to the claims under consideration, contrary to Article 42(1).\n\n(d) The Tribunal noted that *\"the allegations of [Azurix] are based on disputes related to the Concession Agreement\u2019*,92 and, by its express terms, the law of Argentina governed the interpretation of the Concession Agreement.93\n\n(e) The Tribunal referred to what it considered to be Argentine law in a section of the Award dealing with the \"Facts\" and proceeded to determine the disputed issues arising out of the Concession Agreement on the basis that they were of a \"factual\" nature.94 The Tribunal could not avoid the application of Argentine law as the governing law of the contract by re-labelling issues of contractual interpretation as issues of fact. Even if, in general international law, a national law *\"is generally regarded as a fact with reference to which rules of international law have to be applied\",* under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, national law has to be treated as part of the applicable law and not as a fact.\n\n(f) The Tribunal found that in light of the principle of *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* (the *\"exceptio* principle\"), the Province should have accepted ABA\u2019s unilateral termination of the Concession Agreement, and that the Province\u2019s failure to do so was ultimately a breach of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" provision in Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT. However, the *exceptio* principle is not part of Argentine administrative law, which follows French administrative law in creating a special regime for public contracts, one of the essential features of which is that the concessionaire does not have the right to suspend its performance of the contract even if the state party is in breach. The Tribunal in effect modified the applicable law by relying upon a legal principle unknown in Argentine law, and by then testing the Province\u2019s conduct against the \"fair and equitable treatment\" provision by reference to that principle. The Tribunal\u2019s reference to the *exceptio* principle was a fundamental part of its decision regarding Argentina\u2019s alleged breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\n(g) An expert opinion presented by Professor Tom\u00e1s Ram\u00f3n Fern\u00e1ndez in the original proceedings held that the inapplicability of the *exceptio* principle to public service concessions is subject to exceptions where the concession agreement foresees otherwise, or when the inapplicability of the principle may force *\"one person to go bankrupt for the benefit of another, or for the benefit of society as a whole\".* While Argentina rejects Professor Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s analysis of the exceptions, in any event, none of those exceptions\u2014as the Tribunal itself recognised\u2014exist in the present controversy: the Concession Agreement did not foresee the *exceptio* in this case, and ABA could have requested judicial termination of the Concession if it could not continue the Concession.\n\n(h) The Tribunal\u2019s decision therefore abandons the applicable law and in so doing destroys the legitimate expectations of the parties to the Concession Agreement, who contracted on the basis of the applicable Argentine administrative law on public contracts.\n\n(i) In purporting to provide \"a *balance to the relationship between the government and the concessionaire\",*95 and by resorting to the *exceptio* principle, the Tribunal in effect impermissibly decided ex *aequo et bono* instead of deciding in accordance with Argentine law as the law governing the Concession Agreement.96 The Tribunal recognised the applicable law, saw what it thought the result would have been and decided that it would apply something different.\n\n(j) If the Tribunal\u2019s decision is generalised, the absence of the *exceptio* principle in the legal regime applicable to public contracts may constitute a *per se* violation of the equitable treatment standard, and either the compatibility of public contracts with investment protection obligations is now in doubt in all continental legal systems, or the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers by rewriting the rules applicable to the Concession between ABA and the Province.\n\n*In relation to the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention*\n\n(k) Since the law which the Tribunal allegedly applied was not applicable law at all, such law cannot provide a ground for the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion.\n\n(l) Contradictory reasons in an award have been regularly recognized by ICSID *ad hoc* committees as a failure to state reasons,97 and *\"two genuinely contradictory reasons cancel each other out\u2019.98*\n\n(m) The Tribunal\u2019s statement that that it would not apply Argentine law except to the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement, and its statement that it would not analyse the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement as they are not *\"under consideration\",* are two contradictory statements that cancel each other out. Either the Tribunal applies Argentine law or it does not apply Argentine law, but for the Tribunal to apply Argentine law to issues which it will not decide on is a contradiction in terms.\n\n(n) Another contradiction in the Award is that the Tribunal acknowledged that in accordance with Argentine administrative law, the only party who could terminate the agreement was the Provincial Executive Authority, yet the Tribunal found that the refusal by the Province to accept Azurix\u2019s notice of termination of the Concession was a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. Either these two conclusions are contradictory, or the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by applying the *exceptio* principle.\n\n(o) The Tribunal also failed to state reasons as regards its conclusion on the issue of the zoning coefficients,99 since Tribunal in its conclusion failed to address Argentina\u2019s position that the ORAB\u2019s decision had become administratively final. The failure to address arguments raised by the parties, if the answer could have affected the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion, amounts to a failure to state reasons.100\n\n(p) In dealing with the \"full protection and security\" provision in Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT, the Tribunal did not refer to the standard necessary to violate that standard but rather decided that *\"the Tribunal, having failed to provide fair and equitable treatment to the investment, finds that the Respondent also breached the standard of full protection and* *security under the BIT\"*101 If the standard of full protection and security were the same as the standard of fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty, there would be no *effet utile* for the second standard.102 Therefore, the Tribunal has not provided reasons for its conclusion regarding the standard of full protection and security. Furthermore, if the standard of fair and equitable treatment is annulled, this must necessarily imply (as a direct consequence) the annulment of the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion as regards the standard of full protection and security.\n\nRelying on Eric A.

The Tribunal notes that, under Argentine law, international treaties have primacy over domestic laws, and that the Tribunal would apply *\"both legal orders\"* since each one had \"a *role to play\"* which *\"may vary depending on which element of the dispute is considered\"*,103 The Tribunal applied the BIT, the ICSID Convention, international law and Argentine law to consider Azurix\u2019s claims, applying each of them in its proper role.\n\n(b) The Tribunal, upon applying Argentine law to the claims related to the zoning coefficients,104 construction variations,105 Valuations 2000,106 and the Bahia Blanca crisis,107 arrived at the conclusion that the Province\u2019s conduct not only violated the Concession Agreement and the regulatory framework, but also evidenced the exercise of sovereign power that violated BIT standards.108 Conversely, in the case of the Retail Price Index (RPI) and certain Circular 31(A) works, the Tribunal dismissed Azurix\u2019s claims by considering that the Province\u2019s conduct did not violate Argentine law (RPI)109 or that they were simple contractual matters (Circular 31 works) rather than evidencing the exercise of sovereign power.110\n\n(c) The approach of the Tribunal is consistent with international practice.111\n\n(d) The BIT is *lex specialis* under Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention,112 as well as from the standpoint of Argentine national law, since international treaties are part of Argentine law and prevail over local legislation according to Article 75(22) of the Argentine Constitution.\n\n(e) The Tribunal did not \"re-label\" issues of contractual interpretation as issues of fact. From the standpoint of international law, a national law is generally regarded as a fact with reference to which rules of international law have to be applied, rather than as a rule to be applied on the international plane as a rule of law.113\n\n(f) The Tribunal interpreted Argentine law as a step in determining if any breach of contract occurred. Having found certain breaches of contract, the Tribunal examined Azurix\u2019s claims to determine if the conduct of the State violated the BIT. Not every breach of contract by a State automatically amounts to a violation of international law, but the fact that there is a breach of contract does not exclude the possibility that there has been a breach of international law; the standards are simply different.114\n\n(g) The Tribunal applied the BIT and international law to Azurix\u2019s claims under the BIT, and also considered Argentine law in reaching its conclusions on both liability and damages. This approach is consistent with Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, and cannot be considered as a \"manifest\" excess of powers.\n\n(h) The Tribunal\u2019s findings regarding the termination of the Concession Agreement and the violation of the fair and treatment standard are not based on the *exceptio* principle. The Tribunal\u2019s discussion of that principle was *obiter dicta* and not central to its decision concerning failure to accord fair and equitable treatment. The Tribunal considered that the Province\u2019s previous improper conduct and its subsequent decision to refuse ABA\u2019s *\"reasonable request\u2019* to terminate the Concession in September 2001 for the fault of the Grantor and instead to unilaterally terminate the Contract due to an erroneously claimed abandonment of service in March 2002 was a clear breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. This conclusion is not grounded on the *exceptio* principle, which deals with the right of one party to withhold its own contractual performance while the other party is not performing its obligations. The *exceptio* principle was not directly involved because ABA continued rendering the service until the Province\u2019s take-over.\n\n(i) Argentina mischaracterizes the *exceptio* principle by mixing it with ABA\u2019s right to unilaterally terminate the Contract and the Province\u2019s duty to accept termination due to its own breaches. These are different legal categories that do not overlap.\n\n(j) Even the historical legal doctrine which denies the right to apply the *exceptio* principle in government contracts admits that, upon the State\u2019s serious breaches, the private party always is entitled to request termination. The Concession Agreement itself provides that the concessionaire may claim termination based on the Grantor\u2019s fault in specified circumstances.\n\n(k) The Tribunal did not conclude that ABA could terminate the contract unilaterally; it merely asserted that ABA could request termination and that the Province was compelled by the facts of its own breaches to accept such a request given the circumstances of the case. Regardless of who was entitled to issue the formal declaration of termination, what the Tribunal considered of relevance is that, given the Province\u2019s previous behaviour and the significance of its own beaches, it should not have refused a reasonable request for termination of the contract.\n\n(l) In addition, termination of the Contract was not the only basis for the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the fair and equitable treatment standard was violated. The Award also found that the fair and equitable treatment standard was violated by the politicization of the tariff regime and the measures taken by the Province during the Bahia Blanca incident.\n\n(m) Argentina mischaracterises the scope of the *exceptio* principle under Argentine law. Both Argentine legal doctrine and case law have recognised that the exception principle can be invoked by a private party if the State engages in an abuse of rights or in breaches that materially jeopardize the ability of the contractor to comply with the terms of the contract, which was the situation in this case.\n\n(n) Argentina\u2019s disagreement with the Tribunal\u2019s observations on this matter of Argentine law is not enough to meet the standard of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention, since to constitute a manifest excess of power, there must be a wilful refusal to apply the proper law and not just an error in its interpretation or application. There is no evidence that the Tribunal applied a different legal system from that required by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.115\n\n(o) Since the Tribunal did not rely on the *exceptio* principle to conclude that the Province had violated the fair and equitable treatment standard, Argentina\u2019s argument that the Tribunal decided ex *aequo et bono* by resorting to this doctrine is without merit.\n\n*In relation to the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention*\n\n(p) Argentina\u2019s argument that the Tribunal failed to state its reasons in the award must fail as it is also reduced to the erroneous premise that the Tribunal misapplied the law and decided the case according to general equitable principles (ex *aequo et bono).*\n\n(q) There was no failure by the Tribunal to state reasons for its finding that there had been a breach of the \"full protection and security\" provision in Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT. The Tribunal thoroughly detailed its reasons for finding that Argentina breached the fair and equitable treatment standard, and then concluded that these same reasons supported its finding that Argentina breached the full protection and security clause.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 90-92.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 99-102.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 107.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 141-144.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 374-377, 393, 408.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 114-119.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 150, 155, 160.\n\nRelying on *Siemens Award* \u00b6 78.\n\nRelying on *M.C.I.

Such scrutiny is properly the task of a court of appeals, which the ad hoc Committee is not. The ad hoc Committee will limit itself to determining whether the Tribunal did in fact apply the law it was bound to apply to the dispute. Failure to apply such law, as distinguished from mere misconstruction of that law would constitute a* *manifest excess of power on the part of the Tribunal and a ground for nullity under Article 51(1)(b) of the Convention.* *The ad hoc Committee approached this task with caution, distinguishing failure to apply the applicable law as a ground for annulment and misinterpretation of the applicable law as a ground for appeal.120*\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6 5.04; *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 50-51; *Repsol* Annulment Decision \u00b6 38; *Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6 85; *Lucchetti* Annulment Decision \u00b6 112; *MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 45-49.\n\n*Amco I* Annulment Decision \u00b6 23, cited with approval in *Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6 85.\n\n**(d) Failure to apply the correct law as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention: the Committee\u2019s views**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nThe claims made by Azurix and contested by Argentina that were determined by the Tribunal in this case are described in paragraphs 29-31 above. All claims were for alleged violations of the BIT. The Tribunal upheld three of the five claims.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s findings in respect of the applicable law are contained in paragraphs 65 to 68 of the Award, following a discussion of the arguments of the parties on the issue at paragraphs 58 to 64.\n\n140.\n\nAt paragraph 65 of the Award, the Tribunal began by noting *\"the agreement of the parties with the statement that the BIT is the point of reference for judging the merits of Azurix\u2019s claim\".* At paragraph 66, the Tribunal noted that *\"Article 42(1) has been the subject of controversy on the respective roles of municipal law and international law\",* and stated that *\"both legal orders have a role to play, which role will depend on the nature of the dispute and may vary depending on which element of the dispute is considered\u2019.*\n\n141.\n\nAt paragraph 67 of the Award, the Tribunal then stated that:\n\n*Azurix\u2019s claim has been advanced under the BIT and, as stated by the Annulment Committee in* Vivendi II, *the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry is*  *governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law**.* [Emphasis added.]\n\n142.\n\nThe Committee considers that the reference in this passage to *Vivendi II* clearly relates to the paragraphs of the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision mentioned in earlier paragraphs of the Award summarising the arguments of the parties. In particular, in paragraph 60 of the Award, the Tribunal refers to paragraph 102 of the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision, which states:\n\n*In the Committee\u2019s view, it is not open to an ICSID tribunal having jurisdiction under a BIT in respect of a claim based upon a substantive provision of that BIT, to dismiss the claim on the ground that it could or should have been dealt with by a national court. In such a case, the inquiry which the ICSID tribunal is required to undertake is one*  *governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law**. Such an inquiry is neither in principle determined, nor precluded, by any issue of municipal law, including any municipal law agreement of the parties.* [Emphasis added.]\n\n143.\n\nThis statement in the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision is further explained by earlier passages in that decision, in which the *ad hoc* committee said:\n\nAs *to the relation between breach of contract and breach of treaty in the present case, it must be stressed that Articles 3 and 5 of the BIT do not relate directly to breach of a municipal contract. Rather they set an independent standard. A state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract, and vice versa, and this is certainly true of these provisions of the BIT. The point is made clear in Article 3 of the ILC Articles, which is entitled \"Characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful\":*\n\n*The characterization of an act of a State as internationally wrongful is governed by international law. Such characterization is not affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful by internal law.*\n\n*In accordance with this general principle (which is undoubtedly declaratory of general international law), whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions.* *Each of these claims will be determined by reference to its own proper or applicable law\u2014in the case of the BIT, by international law; in the case of the Concession Contract, by the proper law of the contract, in other words, the law of* *Tucum\u00e1n. For example, in the case of a claim based on a treaty, international law rules of attribution apply, with the result that the state of Argentina is internationally responsible for the acts of its provincial authorities. By contrast, the state of Argentina is not liable for the performance of contracts entered into by Tucum\u00e1n, which possesses separate legal personality under its own law and is responsible for the performance of its own contracts.121*\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 95-96.\n\n144.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision went on to quote from the judgment in the *ELSI* case, in which the ICJ said:\n\n*Compliance with municipal law and compliance with the provisions of a treaty are different questions. What is a breach of treaty may be lawful in the municipal law and what is unlawful in the municipal law may be wholly innocent of violation of a treaty provision.*\n\n*... the fact that an act of a public authority may have been unlawful in municipal law does not necessarily mean that that act was unlawful in international law, as a breach of treaty or otherwise. A finding of the local courts that an act was unlawful may well be relevant to an argument that it was also arbitrary; but by itself, and without more, unlawfulness cannot be said to amount to arbitrariness...* *Nor does it follow from a finding by a municipal court that an act was unjustified, or unreasonable, or arbitrary, that that act is necessarily to be classed as arbitrary in international law, though the qualification given to the impugned act by a municipal authority may be a valuable indication.122*\n\n*Case concerning Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (United States America v. Italy),* Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1989, p. 15 (\"ELSI\" case) \u00b6\u00b6 73 and 124, quoted in ILC Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, annexed to GA Resolution 54/83, 12 December 2001, commentary to Article 3, quoted in *Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6 97.\n\n145.\n\nThe Committee agrees with these findings in the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision and the *ELSI* case.\n\n146.\n\nHere the principles are straightforward. Each of Azurix\u2019s claims in this case was for an alleged breach of the BIT. The BIT is an international treaty between Argentina and the United States. By definition, a treaty is governed by international law,123 and not by municipal law. It is a fundamental principle that *\"[a] party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty\".124* In any claim for breach of an investment treaty, the question whether or not there has been a breach of the treaty must therefore be determined, not through the application of the municipal law of any State, but through the application of the terms of the treaty to the facts of the case, in accordance with general principles of international law, including principles of the international law of treaties. Bearing in mind that an investment treaty, whether bilateral or multilateral, is itself a source of international law as between the States parties to that treaty,125 the applicable law in any claim for a breach of that treaty can thus be said to be the treaty itself specifically, and international law generally.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 2(1)(a).\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 27.\n\nCompare Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article 38(1)(a).\n\n147.\n\nFurthermore, in arbitration proceedings under the ICSID Convention, the tribunal also must comply with the terms of the ICSID Convention, which is also an international treaty to be interpreted and applied in accordance with general principles of international law, including principles of the international law of treaties. The Committee considers that, in a claim for breach of an investment treaty, the application by the tribunal of the terms of the investment treaty and of international law as the applicable law is foreseen by the words *\"and such rules of international law as may be applicable\"* in Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention. The Committee considers that the second sentence of Article 42(1) cannot possibly be understood as having the effect that, in the absence of an express choice of law clause, the municipal law of the Contracting State will be the applicable law in claims for alleged breaches of an investment treaty.\n\n148.\n\nThe Committee concludes that the Tribunal correctly identified the law applicable under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention to Azurix\u2019s claims of breaches of the BIT to be *\"the ICSID Convention,... the BIT and... applicable international law\".126*\n\nAward \u00b6 67.\n\n149.\n\nIn some cases, it may be an express term of the investment treaty that the host State is required to comply with specified provisions of its own municipal law. In such cases, a breach by the host State of municipal law may thus amount to a breach of the treaty. Although municipal law does not as such form part of the law applicable to a claim for breach of a treaty, in such cases it may be necessary to determine whether there has been a breach of municipal law as a step in determining whether there has been a breach of the treaty. As the International Law Commission has said:\n\n*The rule that the characterization of conduct as unlawful in international law cannot be affected by the characterization of the same act as lawful in internal law makes no exception for cases where rules of international law require a State to conform to the provisions of its internal law, for instance by applying to aliens the same legal treatment as to nationals. It is true that in such a case, compliance with internal law is relevant to the question of international responsibility. But this is because the rule of international law makes it relevant, e.g. by incorporating the standard of compliance with internal law as the applicable international standard or as an aspect of it. Especially in the fields of injury to aliens and their property and of human rights, the content and application of internal law will often be relevant to the question of international responsibility. In every case it will be seen on analysis that either the provisions of internal law are relevant as facts in applying the applicable international standard, or else that they are actually incorporated in some form, conditionally or unconditionally, into that standard.127*\n\n*ELSI* case \u00b6 124, quoted in ILC Articles, commentary to Article 3, quoted in *Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6 97.\n\n150.\n\nAs a potential example of this, the Committee recalls the arguments of the parties concerning the effect of Article ll(2)(c) of the BIT, which states that *\"[e]ach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\".* In the present case, Azurix argued that the reference to \"obligations\" in this provision included obligations both under municipal law and international law. Argentina on the other hand contended that contractual claims do not become automatically treaty claims by virtue of this provision. The Tribunal ultimately did not decide between these two competing arguments. The Tribunal rejected Azurix\u2019s claim for breach of Article II.2(c) of the BIT on the basis that the parties to the Concession Agreement were not the parties to the present case, Azurix and Argentina. The parties to the Concession Agreement were ABA (a subsidiary of Azurix) and the Province (a political subdivision of Argentina), and, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, there was *\"no undertaking to be honored by Argentina to Azurix other than the obligations under the BIT\u2019,128*\n\nAward \u00b6 384.\n\n151.\n\nIf Azurix and Argentina had been the parties to the Concession Agreement, and if the Tribunal had found that the word \"obligations\" in Article II.2(c) of the BIT included obligations under municipal law (a matter on which the Committee is not called upon to express any view), it might have become necessary for the Tribunal to determine whether Argentina was in breach of obligations under municipal law in order to determine a claim under Article II.2(c) of the BIT. In that event, it would have been necessary for the Tribunal to apply Argentine municipal law in determining whether there was a breach of obligations under municipal law. However, even in this situation, municipal law would not thereby become part of the applicable law under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention for purposes of determining whether there was a breach of Article 11.2(c) of the BIT. Rather, any breach of municipal law that might be established would be a fact or element to which the terms of the BIT and international law would be applied in order to determine whether there was a breach of Article II.2(c).\n\n152.\n\nHaving determined that its inquiry in this case was *\"governed by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law\u2019,* the Tribunal went on to say that:\n\n*While the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry will be guided by this statement, this does not mean that the law of Argentina should be disregarded. On the contrary, the law of Argentina should be helpful in the carrying out of the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry into the alleged breaches of the Concession Agreement to which Argentina\u2019s law applies, but it is only an element of the inquiry because of the treaty nature of the claims under consideration.129*\n\nAward \u00b6 67.\n\n153.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, this statement is consistent with the principles set out above. The Committee therefore finds no fault with the Tribunal\u2019s identification of the applicable law under Article 42.\n\n154.\n\nThe Committee turns then to the question whether the Tribunal did in fact, in deciding each of the three claims of Azurix that it upheld, apply the law that it had identified as the applicable law. These three claims of Azurix were for breach, respectively, of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard under Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT, of the \"arbitrary or discriminatory measures\" provision in Article ll(2)(b) of the BIT, and breaches of the \"full protection and security\" provision in Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT.\n\n155.\n\nAs to the claim for breach of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard under Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT, the Tribunal began by stating that:\n\n*... the BIT is an international treaty that should be interpreted in accordance with the norms of interpretation established by the Vienna Convention. As already noted, the Vienna Convention is binding on the parties to the BIT.* *Article 31(1) of the Convention requires that a treaty be \"interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\".130*\n\nAward \u00b6 359.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal then found, applying these principles, that:\n\n*...It follows from the ordinary meaning of the terms fair and equitable and the purpose and object of the BIT that fair and equitable should be understood to be treatment in* *an even-handed and just manner, conducive to fostering the promotion of foreign investment,131*\n\nAward \u00b6 360.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to consider the expression \"fair and equitable treatment\" in the context of the wording of Article II.2(a) of the BIT as a whole,132 and to consider how \"fair and equitable treatment\" standards, as found in various different investment protection treaties, have been interpreted by different arbitral tribunals.133 Following this analysis, the Tribunal concluded that *\"there is a common thread in the recent awards... which does not require bad faith or malicious intention of the recipient State as a necessary element in the failure to treat investment fairly and equitably\u2019\u2019.'134*\n\nAward \u00b6 361.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 365-372.\n\nAward \u00b6 372.\n\n158.\n\nIt is clear to the Committee that in determining the content of the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard, the Tribunal applied the terms of the BIT itself and the applicable general principles of international law, including the international law of treaties. There was no suggestion that the content of the standard was defined by municipal law or that the question whether there had been a breach of the standard depended on whether or not there had been a breach of obligations under municipal law.\n\n159.\n\nThe Tribunal then concluded, at paragraphs 374 to 376 of the Award, that three separate instances *\"reflect[edj a pervasive conduct of the Province in breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment\u2019*,135 The Tribunal did not expressly find that any of these instances in isolation would necessarily amount to a breach of that standard, but indicated that a breach of the standard was established when the three instances were *\"considered together.*\n\nAward \u00b6 377.\n\n160.\n\nAs to the first of these instances, the Tribunal said, at paragraph 374:\n\n*The Tribunal is struck by the conduct of the Province after the Claimant gave notice of termination of the Concession Agreement. ABA had requested to terminate it in agreement with the Province. The Province refused what was a reasonable request in light of the previous behavior of the Province and its agencies. The refusal by the Province to accept that notice of termination and its insistence on terminating it by itself on account of abandonment of the Concession is a clear case of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. It is evident from the facts before this Tribunal that the Concession was not abandoned.*\n\n161.\n\nContrary to what is argued by Argentina, the Committee also finds no suggestion in this paragraph of the Award that the Tribunal considered Azurix to have a unilateral right under Argentine municipal law to terminate the Concession Agreement, either by virtue of a principle of *exceptio non adimpleti contractus* or otherwise. The Tribunal does not refer in this paragraph to the position under Argentine municipal law at all. The reference to the Province having *\"refused\u2019* a *\"request\u2019* by ABA to terminate the Concession would appear to indicate an assumption on the part of the Tribunal that ABA had *no* legal right to do so unilaterally.\n\n162.\n\nA plain reading of the wording of this paragraph of the Award indicates to the Committee that what the Tribunal took into account as one of the three instances amounting to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard were (1) the *conduct* of the Province in insisting on itself terminating the Concession Agreement on account of abandonment of the Concession by ABA, when it was evident from the facts that the Concession was *not* abandoned, and (2) the *conduct* of the Province in refusing to allow ABA to terminate the Concession in agreement with the Province. Regardless of whether or not such conduct was justified under municipal law, the Tribunal found this conduct of the Province to be material to a breach of the treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment.\n\n163.\n\nArgentina suggests that this reading of paragraph 374 of the Award is contradicted by paragraph 260 of the Award, in which the Tribunal says that *\"the application of the maxim* exceptio non adimpleti contractus *provides a balance to the relationship between the government and the concessionaire\".* According to Argentina, the Tribunal erroneously found that the *exceptio* principle was a part of the municipal law of Argentina, and the Tribunal\u2019s finding in paragraph 374 of the Award is based on this erroneous finding.\n\n164.\n\nIn this regard the Tribunal\u2019s reference to the *exceptio* principle in paragraph 260 of the Award is in the context of its consideration of Article 14.1.4 of the Concession Agreement dealing with \"Termination due to Fault of the Granting Authority\". At paragraphs 255 to 259, the Tribunal dealt with the difficulties in interpreting this provision. Then, at the impugned paragraph 260 the Tribunal stated:\n\n*The difficulty in interpreting the provisions of Article 14 harmoniously is compounded by Article 49-11 of the Law which, as already noted, prescribes that termination \"must be resolved by the Provincial Executive Authority with the intervention of ORAB.\" The Law does not distinguish between termination by the Grantor or the Concessionaire.* *It would seem appropriate that the Concession Agreement be interpreted consistently with the provisions of the Law.* *On the other hand, the Tribunal cannot ignore the practical result of this interpretation: if taken to the extreme, a concessionaire would be obliged to continue to provide the service indefinitely at the discretion of the government and its right to terminate the Concession Agreement would be deprived of any content. For this reason, the application of the maxim* exceptio non adimpleti contractus *provides a balance to the relationship between the government and the concessionaire. The Tribunal considers it immaterial whether ABA raised this defense in its recourse to the Argentine courts. The Tribunal is assessing the conduct of the Respondent and its instrumentalities in the exercise of its public authority against the standards of protection of foreign investors agreed in the BIT, and the application of the maxim* exceptio non adimpleti contractus *has been raised by the Claimant in these proceedings. This exception is not unknown to Argentine law and to legal systems generally as it is a reflection of the principle of good faith. The Tribunal will take it into account when evaluating the actions of the Province under the standards of protection.*\n\n165.\n\nOn the basis of this paragraph the Committee is not satisfied either (1) that the Tribunal found there to be an *exceptio* principle in Argentine municipal law on which Azurix was entitled to rely in the circumstances of this case; or (2) that the Tribunal\u2019s finding of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard was premised on any finding by the Tribunal that the Province had denied ABA its right under Argentine law to rely on the *exceptio* principle.\n\n166.\n\nFirst, as has been noted above, the Tribunal expressly stated in paragraph 67 of the Award that in determining Azurix\u2019s claims under the BIT, the Tribunal\u2019s inquiry is governed *\"by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable international law\".* The Tribunal relied for this proposition on the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision, which makes clear that treaty standards are independent of municipal law standards, such that the question whether or not there has been a breach of the former does not depend on whether or not there has been a breach of the latter. The Committee finds that it therefore cannot read into paragraphs 260 and 374 of the Award any implied finding by the Tribunal that the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard was due to ABA having been denied any specific right under Argentine municipal law.\n\n167.\n\nSecondly, there is no clear finding made in paragraph 260 that the *exceptio* principle does in fact exist in Argentine municipal law. Indeed, the first three sentences of this paragraph appear to assume that it does not or, at the least, may not. The fourth sentence of this paragraph then refers to the practical consequences of this conclusion. The fifth sentence of the paragraph then states *\"[f]or this reason, the application of the maxim* exceptio non adimpleti contractus *provides a balance to the relationship between the government and the concessionaire\".* It is not clear from the wording of this particular sentence whether the Tribunal is speaking of the position under Argentine municipal law or of the position under the treaty standard. However, the remaining sentences of that paragraph appear to confirm that it is speaking of the position under the *treaty standard.* In the remaining sentences the Tribunal says that it is immaterial whether the *exceptio* principle was raised before the municipal courts because *\"[t]he Tribunal is assessing the conduct of the Respondent and its instrumentalities... against the standards of protection... in the BIT, and the* /exceptio *principle]... has been raised by the Claimant in these proceedings\".* The Tribunal says that the *exceptio* principle is not unknown *\"to legal systems generally as it is a reflection of the principle of good faith\"* and that the Tribunal would therefore *\"take it into account when evaluating the actions of the Province under the standards of protection\".*\n\n168.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal also says in this paragraph that the *exceptio* principle is *\"not unknown to Argentine law\",* the Committee cannot read into this a specific finding by the Tribunal that ABA would have been entitled in the circumstances of this case to invoke this principle as a matter of Argentine municipal law. In its Memorial on Annulment, Argentina appears to accept that in Argentine law *\"in some cases the* exceptio /s a *defence that can be invoked by a concessionaire, although not an essential utility concessionaire\".136* The Tribunal\u2019s statement that the principle is *\"not unknown in Argentine law\"* is therefore not incorrect. On the most adverse construction of what the Tribunal said, the Committee considers that the Tribunal did not go beyond referring to such principle merely as an *additional* justification when applying the treaty standard. In any event, even if the Tribunal had been wholly wrong in considering that the *exceptio* principle was *\"not unknown to Argentine !aw\u2019,* nonetheless it would not constitute an annullable error for the Tribunal to have taken it into account when applying the treaty standard.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, footnote 116.\n\n169.\n\nFurthermore, even if it were the case, contrary to the Committee\u2019s conclusions above, that the Tribunal erroneously found that ABA had the right under Argentine law to rely on the *exceptio* principle in this case, and then found that the Province\u2019s denial of this right amounted to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard, that would not in the Committee\u2019s view amount to an annullable error. The Tribunal correctly identified the applicable law under Article 42 as the ICSID Convention, the BIT and applicable international law. It would have been open to the Tribunal to find that the treaty standard had been violated in circumstances where ABA had been denied a right that it had under Argentine municipal law. Even if the Tribunal had been wholly incorrect in finding that ABA had such a right under Argentine law, the Committee considers that this would be a matter going to the merits of the Tribunal\u2019s findings. And, as noted above, it is not a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention that there are *\"errors in the interpretation of the requirements of applicable law or in the ascertainment or evaluation of the relevant facts to which such law has been applied\",137*\n\nSee paragraph 137 above.\n\n170.\n\nArgentina argues that if the Tribunal\u2019s decision is generalised, the result is that, in every municipal legal system in which the *exceptio* principle is not recognised in the legal regime applicable to public contracts, the absence of this principle may constitute a *per se* violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, such that the compatibility of public contracts with investment protection obligations is now in doubt in those legal systems. The Committee does not accept this argument. The Tribunal\u2019s decision was based on the specific factual circumstances of this particular case, and is merely an example of a case in which it was found that, in all the circumstances, there was a breach of a treaty standard even if there may have been no breach of any obligation under municipal law.\n\n171.\n\nIn paragraphs 375 and 376 of the Award, the Tribunal refers to the two other instances which, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, considered together with the instance referred to in paragraph 374, amounted to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. In neither paragraphs 375 and 376 did the Tribunal suggest that the question whether there was a breach of this treaty treatment standard depended on whether or not there had been a breach of Argentine law. The quotes from the *ELSI* case above confirm that a breach of municipal law is not a prerequisite to a finding of a breach of the treaty standard, although it may be a relevant consideration. From the wording of paragraphs 92, 102 and 375 of the Award, it appears to the Committee that in the case of the zoning coefficients and construction variations, the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion was based not on any finding that there had been specific breaches of Argentine law by the Province or its authorities, but on a finding that the conduct of the relevant authorities was based on political considerations rather than on applying the terms of the Concession Agreement, as evidenced for instance in the different treatment given to the new service provider after the Concession Agreement with ABA had been terminated.\n\n172.\n\nAs to the breach of the \"arbitrary or discriminatory measures\" standard in Article ll(2)(b) of the BIT, the Tribunal found on the basis of the plain wording of the text of that provision (which it said was not contested by Argentina) that a measure needs only to be arbitrary to constitute a breach of this provision.138\n\nAward \u00b6 391.\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal then stated that:\n\n*The Tribunal is required to consider the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the BIT under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. The findings of other tribunals, and in particular of the ICJ, should be helpful to the Tribunal in its interpretative task.139*\n\nThe Tribunal went on to consider the ordinary meaning of the word \"arbitrary\", and decisions of other international arbitration tribunals and the *ELSI* case,140 and ultimately concluded that certain actions of the Province were *\"arbitrary actions without base on the Law or the Concession Agreement\u2019* which *\"impaired the operation of Azurix\u2019s investment\u2019*,141 The Committee considers that the law that the Tribunal applied was the applicable law under Article 42 referred to above.\n\nAward \u00b6 391.\n\nAward \u00b6 392.\n\nAward \u00b6 393.\n\n174.\n\nAs to the breach of the \"full protection and security\" standard in Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT, the Tribunal referred to other relevant international arbitration case law,142 to differences in wording in analogous provisions in other bilateral investment treaties,143 and to the ordinary meaning of the expression.144 The Tribunal stated that other cases showed, and the Tribunal apparently agreed, that:\n\n*... full protection and security... go[es] beyond protection and security ensured by the police. It is not only a matter of physical security; the stability afforded by a secure investment environment is as important from an investor\u2019s point of view.145*\n\nAward \u00b6 406.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 407-408.\n\nAward \u00b6 408.\n\nAward \u00b6 408.\n\n175.\n\nThe Tribunal went on to conclude that:\n\n*... the Tribunal, having held that the Respondent failed to provide fair and equitable treatment to the investment, finds that the Respondent also breached the standard of full protection and security under the BIT.146*\n\nThe Committee once more is satisfied that the law that the Tribunal applied was the applicable law under Article 42 referred to above.\n\nAward \u00b6 408.\n\n176.\n\nThe Committee reiterates that it is not part of its function in annulment proceedings to examine the merits of the Tribunal\u2019s decision to uphold the claims of Azurix that it upheld, or to reject the claims of Azurix that it rejected. In particular, as noted above, in relation to the present ground of annulment, the Committee\u2019s function is confined to determining whether Tribunal applied the correct applicable law, not whether the Tribunal applied the applicable law correctly.\n\n177.\n\nFor these reasons, the Committee rejects Argentina\u2019s ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) based on the alleged failure of the Tribunal to apply the applicable law under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(e) Failure of the award to state the reasons on which it is based as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention: applicable principles**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThe scope of this ground of annulment has been considered in various decisions of *ad hoc* committees in different cases. It has been said that:\n\n*[I]t is well accepted both in the cases and the literature that Article 52(1)(e) concerns a failure to state* any *reasons with respect to all or part of an award, not the failure to state correct or convincing reasons... Provided that the reasons given by a tribunal can be followed and relate to the issues that were before the tribunal, their correctness is beside the point in terms of Article 52(1)(e). Moreover, reasons may be stated succinctly or at length, and different legal traditions differ in their modes of expressing reasons. Tribunals must be allowed a degree of discretion as to the way in which they express their reasoning.... In the Committee\u2019s view, annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in a clear case. This entails two conditions: first, the failure to state reasons must leave the decision on a particular point essentially lacking in any expressed rationale; and second, that point must itself be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision. It is frequently said that contradictory reasons cancel each other out, and indeed, if reasons are genuinely contradictory so they might. However, tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting considerations, and an ad hoc committee should be careful not to discern contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal\u2019s reasons could more truly be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations.147*\n\n*In the Committee\u2019s view, the requirement to state reasons is satisfied as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact* *or of law. This minimum requirement is in particular not satisfied by either contradictory or frivolous reasons.148*\n\n*In the end the question is whether an informed reader of the Award would understand the reasons given by the Tribunal and would discern no material contradiction in them.149*\n\n*... annulment under Article 52(1)(e) should only occur in clear cases and...a failure to state reasons, in order to lead to annulment, must not only lack in any expressed rationale, but the relevant point must also be necessary to the tribunal\u2019s decision.150*\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 64-65; quoted in *MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 50.\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6 5.09.\n\n*MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 92.\n\n*Lucchetti* Annulment Decision \u00b6 128.

The extent to which alleged breaches of contract were material to the determination of claims of breaches of a treaty standard was a matter for the Tribunal to determine when dealing with each of the individual claims. The Committee finds nothing contradictory in the Award in this respect.\n\n181.\n\nArgentina further argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its conclusion on the issue of the zoning coefficients,151 since it failed to address in its conclusion Argentina\u2019s position that the ORAB\u2019s decision had become administratively final. The Committee finds that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion was that the action of ORAB referred to in paragraph 83 of the Award *\"reflect[ed] a concern with the political consequences of the elimination of the coefficients rather than with keeping to the terms of the Concession Agreement\u2019*,152 and that there was a breach of the BIT due to the fact that *\"the tariff regime was politicized because of concerns with forthcoming elections or because the Concession was awarded by the previous government\u2019*,153 The Committee is not persuaded that it was material to this reasoning of the Tribunal whether or not ORAB\u2019s decision had become administratively final, and the Committee therefore considers that the failure of the Tribunal to address this argument expressly does not amount to a failure to state reasons upon which its decision was based.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 78-92.\n\nAward \u00b6 92.\n\nAward \u00b6 375.\n\n182.\n\nArgentina additionally claims that the Tribunal did not state the standard necessary to violate the \"full protection and security\" standard in Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT, but merely stated that *\"the Tribunal, having failed to provide fair and equitable treatment to the investment, finds that the Respondent also breached the standard of full protection and security under the BIT\u2019.154* Argentina argues that the Tribunal thereby treats the standard of full protection and security as if it were the same as the standard of fair and equitable treatment, and that this denies any *effet utile* for the full protection and security standard.\n\nAward \u00b6 408.\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s findings with respect to the content of the fair and equitable treatment standard are set out in paragraphs 359 to 372 of the Award, and its findings in respect of the full protection and security standard are contained in paragraphs 406 to 408. The Committee considers it apparent from these paragraphs that the Tribunal did not necessarily consider the two standards identical, but that it did consider the latter to be, in effect, a sub-category of the former, in the sense that a breach of the latter standard would necessarily entail a breach of the former standard. This is apparent not only from the sentence in paragraph 408 of the Award relied upon by Argentina, but also from the statement in paragraph 407 of the Award that:\n\n*The tribunal in Occidental based its decision on a clause worded exactly like in the BIT, and nonetheless considered that, after it had found that the fair and equitable standard had been breached, \"the question of whether in addition there has been a breach of full protection and security under this Article becomes moot as a treatment that is not fair and equitable automatically entails an absence of full protection and security.155*\n\nAward \u00b6 407, referring to *Occidental Exploration and Production Company v. Ecuador* (LCIA Administered Case No. UN 3467) Award, dated July 1,2004, \u00b6 187.\n\n184.\n\nArgentina\u2019s argument that the Tribunal\u2019s findings in this respect leave no *effet utile* for the full protection and security standard might, if accepted, support a conclusion that the Tribunal was wrong in law. However, mere error of law, even if this could be established, is not a ground for annulment. The Committee considers that the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning, right or wrong, is quite clear. The Committee therefore considers that there is no basis for annulling this finding under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**F. Denial of fundamental evidence and failure to consider key arguments**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n185.\n\nArgentina claims that it was denied evidence essential to its defence, by virtue of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Orders No. 2 to No. 6, and that the Tribunal failed to consider key arguments of Argentina in relation to certain matters or to give reasons for its decision on those matters.\n\n**(b) Background**\n------------------\n\n186.\n\nIn its Counter Memorial in the proceedings before the Tribunal, Argentina requested the Tribunal, under the terms of ICSID Arbitration Rules 33 and 34, to request Azurix to:\n\n*a) Produce, and notify the Argentine Republic of, all the reports, analyses, and all other documentation relating to its participation in the privatisation in Buenos Aires Province. This documentation should include all the documents, records, reports, minutes of directors\u2019 meetings, letters, and e-mails in possession of AZURIX relating to the Bidding Process. Specially, AZURIX is asked to attach a copy of the documentation filed with the Buenos Aires Province for participating in the Bidding Process (Envelope No. 1 and Envelope No. 2).*\n\n*b) Produce, and notify the Argentine Republic of, all the documentation filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and with any other (federal or state) governmental entity of the United States of America relating to Azurix\u2019s initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in 1999, as well as all other subsequent documentation submitted during the period AZURIX\u2019S stock was listed on the stock markets (e.g., balance sheets).*\n\n187.\n\nThe Counter-Memorial stated that:\n\n*The purpose of the foregoing is to prove the unfairness of AZURIX\u2019S offer, its opportunistic behaviour, the direct relation with the impending IPO of AZURIX, its relation with ENRON, as well as to prove the circumstances associated with Information Letters Nos. 51(B) and 52(A) and Section 12.1.1 of the Contract.*\n\n188.\n\nBy letter of March 15, 2004, Azurix objected to Argentina\u2019s request, stating *inter alia* that the request was inconsistent with the ICSID Rules, the parties\u2019 agreements at the First Session of the Tribunal, and the general principles on evidence in the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Commercial Arbitration, that the requests were grossly overbroad, that Argentina had not explained how or why these documents were relevant to the issues in dispute or would materially affect the outcome of the case, and that many of the requested documents were already in Argentina\u2019s possession. The letter stated that Argentina\u2019s request appeared to be *\"little more than an impermissible fishing expedition\"* designed to delay the proceedings.\n\n189.\n\nBy letter of March 26, 2004, Argentina rejected Azurix\u2019s objections and stated that Argentina would have no problem in requesting the Province of Buenos Aires to produce evidence that the Tribunal considered relevant under the terms of ICSID Arbitration Rule 34.\n\n190.\n\nOn April 19, 2004, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, which noted that the Reply of Azurix was due by May 7, 2004, and resolved:\n\n*1. To invite the Respondent to request the Province to provide it with \"the documentation filed with the Buenos Aires Province for participating in the Bidding Process (Envelope No. 1 and Envelope No. 2)\"...*\n\n*2. To postpone consideration of the production of the remainder of the evidence requested until the Tribunal has had the opportunity to review the Claimant\u2019s Reply.*\n\n191.\n\nBy letter dated May 17, 2004, Argentina informed the Tribunal that the documents requested in Procedural Order No. 2 would be shortly submitted, but stated:\n\n*Given that there are irregularities in this documentation, especially in connection with Circulars Nos. 51(B) and 52(A), and that there is no circular supporting the inclusion of article 12.1.1 or other amendments in the Concession Contract, the Argentine Republic requests the Tribunal not to send a copy of the aforesaid documentation to Azurix* *Corp, until the latter has produced a copy of the Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2 that it submitted in the bidding process.*\n\n192.\n\nBy letter dated May 20, 2004, Argentina Informed the Tribunal that it had sent to the Tribunal the documentation received from the Province and repeated the request it had made in its letter of May 17, 2004.\n\n193.\n\nOn May 24, 2004, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, which noted that there was a dispute between the parties relating to the documentation presented in the bidding process, and decided to:\n\n*1. Request the Claimant to furnish to the Tribunal the said envelopes No. 1 and No. 2 not later than June 7, 2004 and, upon their receipt, to send to each party the envelopes No. 1 and No. 2 received from the other party.*\n\n*2. Inform the parties that the Tribunal will take into account the relevance of such information and the cost of this procedural incident in its decision on the costs of these proceedings.*\n\n194.\n\nBy letter to the Tribunal dated May 31, 2004, Argentina stated *inter alia* as follows:\n\n*The purpose of the request for the confidentiality of the documentation until after Azurix had submitted Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2 was for Claimant to produce copies of the documents in its possession so as to allow the Tribunal to compare them with those to be produced by Argentina.* *Thus, the Tribunal would be able to know the actual facts.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*On Friday, May 28, this Treasury Attorney General\u2019s Office became aware of Azurix Corp, \u2019s failure to comply with the confidentiality established in Procedural Order No. 3.*\n\n*Pursuant to item 1 of Procedural Order No. 3, Azurix was only to have access to the Envelopes in possession of the Province after it had sent its own copies of the Envelopes. However, Azurix requested copies of Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2 from the Province.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The request for access to the administrative record does not make any reference to this arbitration.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*According to the fax attached to this letter, on 28 May, Azurix\u2019s representatives had access to the requested administrative record, in particular to Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2 of Azurix\u2019s offer, and asked for photocopies thereof.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Owing to Azurix\u2019s behaviour, the Argentine Republic hereby waives the confidentiality it had requested from the Tribunal by letters dated 17 and 20 May because the confidentiality ordered by the President is pointless at present.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*For the same reason, the Argentine Republic hereby withdraws its request for Azurix to produce copies of Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2 of its offer in the bidding process.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Notwithstanding the waiver of the confidentiality and the withdrawal of the request for evidence, the Argentine Republic requests the President to bear in mind that by breaching a procedural order Azurix has infringed this party\u2019s right of defence since it has deprived Argentina of evidence deemed essential to the safeguarding of its rights.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*... the Tribunal (and Claimant) are hereby informed about the irregularities of Envelope No. 2 of Azurix\u2019s offer, a copy of which was sent by the Province (and forwarded to the Tribunal).*\n\n*In particular, the following should be observed with regard to Envelope No. 2 submitted by Azurix to the Province:*\n\n*(a) Volume 1 of Envelope No. 2 includes the circulars signed and accepted by Azurix upon submitting the economic offer. This volume ends with the last page of the list of personnel included in Circular No. 50(B); i.e. the volume with the circulars accepted by Azurix ends with Circular No. 50(B).*\n\n*(b) Circulars Nos. 51(B) and 52(A) were inserted into the List of Personnel to be transferred, in a place where two pages of such list of personnel are missing.*\n\n*(c) There seems to be no circular supporting the inclusion of articles 12.1.1 and 13.2.5.6 in the Concession Contract.*\n\n195.\n\nBy a letter dated June 7, 2004, the Secretary to the Tribunal informed the parties as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal notes the waiver by the Argentine Republic of the confidentiality of the documentation furnished to the Secretary of the Tribunal under cover of a communication dated May 20, 2004, and the withdrawal by the Argentine Republic of its request to the Tribunal regarding the documentation referred to in Procedural Order No. 3. The Tribunal notes further that, according to the Claimant, copies of envelopes 1 and 2 are not readily available in its own records.*\n\n*The Tribunal will consider the relevance of the matters raised in said communications as part of its overall examination of the submissions by the parties in this case.*\n\n196.\n\nBy letter to the Tribunal dated July 22, 2004, Argentina stated as follows:\n\n*Considering item 2 of Procedural Order No. 2, and in light of the fact that Azurix filed its Reply on 7 May 2004, without enclosing any documentation or evidence related to the request made by the Argentine Republic in its Counter-Memorial, the Tribunal is requested to order the submission of the evidence that was requested in due time by this Office and was not covered by Procedural Order No. 3.*\n\n*It should be noted that the remainder of the evidence requested is essential for the Argentine Republic to be able to exercise its right of defence in this arbitration.*\n\nBy a letter dated July 28, 2004, Azurix opposed this request on the ground that it was belated, overbroad and that Argentina had not explained how the requested documents were relevant.\n\n197.\n\nOn July 29, 2004, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, which noted that the Tribunal had now had the opportunity to review Azurix\u2019s reply, and decided to reject Argentina\u2019s July 22, 2004 request for production of evidence *\"because of its general nature and failure to justify it on the basis of the reasons adduced\u2019.*\n\n198.\n\nBy letter to the Tribunal dated August 2, 2004, the stated purpose of which was *\"to justify in more detail the request for evidence made by this Office and make it more precise\",* Argentina asked the Tribunal to order Azurix to submit the following documents:\n\n*a) the report prepared by the consulting firm \"HYTSA Estudios y Proyectos S.A.\" for Azurix Corp, within the context of the bidding process in the Province of Buenos Aires for the purpose of evaluating the Concession;*\n\n*b) the technical, economic or legal studies of Azurix Corp., or those prepared at the request of Azurix Corp., in order to submit the technical offer (Envelope No. 1) and the economic offer (Envelope No. 2) in the bidding of the Province of Buenos Aires; and*\n\n*c) the January to August 1999 Board of Directors meeting minutes of Azurix Corp., Enron Corp., Operadora de Buenos Aires SRL, and Azurix AGOSBA SRL, related to the bidding.*\n\nThat letter went on to state that:\n\n*The evidence requested is aimed at confirming that the offer submitted by Azurix Corp, in the bidding process was aggressive and opportunistic and that it was related to the imminent initial public offering (IPO) by Azurix Corp, on the New York Stock Exchange.*\n\n*This request for evidence is made in the knowledge that it is a general principle of law that the party that is in a better position to prove a fact bears the burden of proof, and that the Argentine Republic has proved perfectly well that the offer made by Azurix Corp, was aggressive and opportunistic.*\n\n*This request is not aimed at postponing the hearing on the merits. Claimant should be in possession of the evidence requested and should be able to produce it within one or two weeks. In that case, the parties and their experts would*\n\n*have enough time to examine it before the scheduled hearing.*\n\nAzurix opposed this request.\n\n199.\n\nOn August 16, 2004, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, in which the Tribunal decided:\n\n*To reject the Respondent\u2019s request for production of evidence formulated in its communication of August 2, 2004 because, even if such request is more precise in terms of the requested evidence than the request that was the subject of Procedural Order No. 4, it fails to be adequately justified since it continues to be based on the amount paid by the concession and accepted by the Province of Buenos Aires.*\n\n200.\n\nBy letter to the Tribunal dated August 23, 2004, Argentina requested the Tribunal *\"to reconsider Respondent\u2019s request for evidence so as to preserve the Argentine Republic\u2019s right of defence in these arbitration proceedings\".* That letter stated, *inter alia'.*\n\n*... in the exercise of its right of defence, Argentina has sufficiently proven that:*\n\n*a) Azurix Corp.\u2019s offer in the Province of Buenos Aires was aggressive (it was six to eighteen times higher than the next best bid).*\n\n*b) There was a close and direct relationship between the offer in the Province of Buenos Aires and the imminent IPO in New York, as well as between the former and the permanent objective to renegotiate the terms of the Concession Contract.*\n\n*c) Azurix Corp, needed to be awarded the provincial water and sewage Concession to gain experience in the water sector.*\n\n*d) In accordance with the legal system applicable to the Concession Contract, the Concessionaire was not entitled to transfer the canon to tariffs.*\n\n*2 - In addition to producing its own evidence, the Argentine Republic requested the Tribunal to order Azurix Corp, to produce the documents in its possession, in order to confirm what had already been proven by Respondent.* *Azurix Corp, objected to this request by letter of 15 March 2004.*\n\n*3. - In such circumstances, by Procedural Order No. 2 the Tribunal decided: \"To postpone consideration of the production of the remainder of the evidence requested until the Tribunal has had the opportunity to review the Claimant\u2019s Reply. \"*\n\n*4. - In its Reply, Azurix Corp, attempted to deny Argentina\u2019s contentions. However, it did not produce the evidence requested in the Counter-Memorial nor did it adequately refute the statements included therein.*\n\n*5 - This was noted by the Argentine Republic in its letters of 22 July and 2 August 2004 and in the Rejoinder.*\n\n*6.- In the context described above and based on item 2 of Procedural Order No. 2, Respondent asks the members of the Tribunal to reconsider Argentina\u2019s request for evidence.*\n\n*The reason for this petition for reconsideration is that if Argentina\u2019s allegations were not taken into account or were held not to have been proven, Respondent\u2019s right of defence would be seriously and inexplicably impaired.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Respondent is feeling extremely discouraged by seeing how the Tribunal is gradually depriving Argentina of some of its most basic defensive elements...*\n\n*It is not possible to understand the reasoning that allows reconciling the natural urge of every impartial arbitrator to know the material truth with the rejection of evidence that might easily lead the arbitrator to find such truth.* [Footnotes omitted.]\n\nAzurix reiterated its objections to this request.\n\n201.\n\nOn September 9, 2004, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, in which it said that it had considered anew Argentina\u2019s request and had now had the opportunity to review the Rejoinder, and in which it decided:\n\n*To request the Claimant to submit, not later than September 17, 2004, the study prepared by HYTSA referred to in paragraph 35 of the Rejoinder, and*\n\n*To request the Respondent to submit, not later than September 17, 2004, the bid evaluation reports related to each stage of the bidding for the concession prepared under the authority of the Province of Buenos Aires.*\n\n**(c) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) It was part of Argentina\u2019s case that, because Azurix needed to win the bidding process in order for its upcoming IPO to be successful, Azurix had made an unreasonable offer in the bidding process, expecting to later renegotiate the terms of the Concession Agreement. With the purpose of proving that, Argentina requested the Tribunal to order Azurix to submit all the documents on which it had relied to make such offer and all the documents connected with the IPO.\n\nDespite the importance of this evidence to Argentina\u2019s defence, at first the Tribunal postponed consideration of Argentina\u2019s request until after the submission of the Reply, and then subsequently twice rejected the request, and then only partially granted it.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s decision to order Azurix to submit the HYTSA Report was issued seven months after Argentina\u2019s initial request and less than a month before the hearing on the merits, and Argentina received the HYTSA Report only one week before the hearing on the merits, which was too late to use it.\n\nBy depriving Argentina of evidence that might have supported its allegations, the Tribunal seriously affected Argentina\u2019s right of defence which constitutes *\"an essential part of the right to a fair trial\u2019,* a violation of which constitutes a *\"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\"* within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(b) The minutes of the first session of the Tribunal were stated to be *\"[w]ithout prejudice to the power of the Tribunal to request the parties to produce any further evidence at any stage of the proceedings\".* Under the ICSID Arbitration Rules, a party is not required to make a request for evidence at any particular time, and is not required to tailor its requests for evidence to the points to which the evidence would be directed or under an obligation to explain why the documents are relevant and material to the outcome of the case. In other ICSID cases, evidence has been requested by a respondent in its counter-memorial or later.\n\n(c) One of the consequences of the principle of cooperation of the parties with the tribunal in establishing the relevant facts is that *\"any party is obliged to provide the [tribunal] with relevant documents, which only it* possesses.\"156\n\n(d) Instead of submitting its own copies of Envelopes No. 1 and 2 as ordered in Procedural Order No. 3, Azurix instead obtained copies from the Province of Buenos Aires, this destroying the ability of the Tribunal to compare the two sets of documents. Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(3), in case of failure of a party to comply with its obligation to cooperate with the Tribunal in the production of evidence, the Tribunal must take formal note of it. However, in the Award the Tribunal did not establish what the consequences of Azurix\u2019s conduct were. It simply held that there was no evidence to support Argentina's allegations of irregularities in the bidding process, without considering Azurix\u2019s failure to submit evidence which might have confirmed the existence of such irregularities. By disregarding Azurix\u2019s breach of Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal seriously affected Argentina\u2019s right of defence, which was a serious departure from a fundamental rules of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(e) The Tribunal did not afford equal treatment of the parties with regard to evidentiary issues. By Procedural Order No. 2 the Tribunal immediately granted Azurix\u2019s request for evidence of March 15, 2004, while it postponed consideration of Argentina\u2019s request for evidence of February 9, 2004. Furthermore, Azurix only had to make its request for evidence once, whereas Argentina had to make its request five times, which the Tribunal only partially granted seven months after the initial request. In addition, the Tribunal did not order Azurix to submit the studies on which it had relied to make its offer in the bidding process, but ordered Argentina to submit the bid evaluation reports related to each stage of the bidding process. The Tribunal\u2019s unequal treatment of the parties are constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(f) Fundamental to Argentina\u2019s case was the relationship between Azurix and Enron. In addition to the fact that the relationship between Azurix and Enron was public knowledge, Argentina produced various pieces of evidence with the purpose of proving the existence of that relationship. The fact that the HYTSA Report was not addressed to Azurix but to Enron further proved the existence of this relationship. However, the Tribunal neither granted Argentina\u2019s request for the Tribunal to order Azurix to produce certain other evidence aimed at confirming the existence of the relationship between Azurix and Enron, nor acted on Argentina\u2019s proposal that the Tribunal request the United States Congress to submit its reports on the Enron scandal and its connection with Azurix.\n\nDespite the evidence and requests of Argentina, the Tribunal denied any relevance to the relationship between Azurix and Enron. The Tribunal did not give any reasons for disregarding the evidence produced by Argentina on the connection between Azurix and Enron. The Tribunal simply held that *\"[b]ased on the documentation submitted by the parties, the Tribunal considers that nothing has been proven that relates the case before this Tribunal to ENRON\u2019s case\".*157 If the Tribunal was dissatisfied with the evidence before it, it should have granted Argentina\u2019s request for evidence. It was contradictory for it not to grant such a request and then hold that the evidence in the record was insufficient. The Tribunal thereby failed to state reasons within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n(g) The Tribunal also failed to state reasons, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, in disregarding the existence of irregularities in the bidding process without explaining why, and in particular, in failing to explain why it did not give heed to Azurix\u2019s breach of Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n(h) Procedural Orders No. 2 to 6, signed by the President of the Tribunal, took on a new meaning in the context of the proposal to disqualify Dr. Rigo Sureda.\n\nRelying on Robert Kolb, *General Principles of Procedural Law, in* THE STATUTE OF THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE: A COMMENTARY 793, 829 (Andreas Zimmermann, Christian Tomuschat & Karin Oellers-Frahm eds., 2006).\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 55.\n\n203.\n\nAzurix argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) Argentina has failed to identify any ICSID procedural rule that it says was violated. No party has an unfettered right of access to any and all of the opposing party\u2019s documents.\n\n(b) Argentina\u2019s requests for production of documents were made more than two and a half years after the case was filed and one and a half years after Azurix filed its Memorial; and Argentina did not \"narrow\" its request until more than two months after Azurix\u2019s Reply was filed, and only days before Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder was due and just two months before the final hearing date.\n\n(c) Argentina\u2019s requests were overbroad, untimely and irrelevant. These defects are what caused the Tribunal to deny Argentina\u2019s requests, not bias against Argentina.\n\n(d) Even if Azurix\u2019s bid was found to be too large, in no way would this provide Argentina with any defense to its unfair and inequitable treatment of Azurix\u2019s investment. The Province accepted the bid and took the entire $438.55 million offered, never suggesting at the time that it was unreasonable.\n\n(e) Argentina\u2019s reasoning would deny the Tribunal any discretion relating to evidence requests.\n\n(f) Argentina has not established how proving Azurix\u2019s connection to Enron or that Azurix\u2019s bid was unreasonable would have proven or have been of relevance to the issues in this case.\n\n(g) Each party was given precisely the same opportunities with regard to discovery issues. The Tribunal did not deny Argentina the ability to make requests, but merely held that Argentina was obligated to comply with the same rules that were applicable to Azurix. Argentina\u2019s failure to conform its requests to the rules does not mean the parties were treated unequally.\n\n(h) The Tribunal decided this case in a way that made any allegations of an \"unreasonable offer\" by Azurix moot, since the Tribunal did not base damages on the amount of the offer tendered by Azurix, but decided instead that the Concession was worth only a fraction (USD 60 million) of the total amount received by Argentina. In effect, Argentina prevailed on this point.\n\n(i) Argentina\u2019s disagreement with the conclusion reached by the Tribunal does not demonstrate any serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.158\n\n(j) The Tribunal did evaluate Argentina\u2019s argument concerning Azurix\u2019s relationship to Enron, and ultimately rejected it.159 Enron\u2019s problems had absolutely no bearing on the case filed by Azurix against Argentina for the latter\u2019s violations of the BIT. The Tribunal did not state that there was not enough evidence to support a connection between Azurix and Enron; rather, it stated that nothing showed that Enron\u2019s problems were related to Azurix\u2019s case against Argentina.\n\n(k) The Tribunal expressly addressed the issue of \"irregularities\" in paragraph 56 of the Award, and rejected Argentina\u2019s argument due to lack of evidence. Argentina seeks to reopen the issue of alleged \"corruption\" at this stage without giving a single reason why the Tribunal\u2019s finding might be deemed inaccurate.\n\n(l) Azurix did not breach Procedural Order No. 3; on the contrary it sought access to the official public file precisely in order to comply with the Tribunal\u2019s request, as it has not kept copies of every document filed.\n\n(m) Even if the Tribunal had breached a fundamental rule, Argentina has not demonstrated that the breach was \"serious\" by showing that the result would have been different had the departure from the rule not occurred.\n\nRelying on *Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 59-61.\n\nReferring to Award \u00b6 55, and relying on *Soufraki Annulment Decision* \u00b6 131 : *\"It is of course not necessary for a tribunal to give a reason for an assertion which is in itself a reason. That would be to initiate an endless and regressive cycle of reasoning. Not every word has to be explained.\"*\n\n**(d) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention: applicable principles**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nThe principles applicable to a ground of annulment based on Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention are considered by the Committee in paragraphs 49-52 above.\n\n**(e) Failure of the award to state reasons as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention: applicable principles**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe principles applicable to a ground of annulment based on Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention are considered by the Committee in paragraphs 53-55 and 178 above.\n\n**(f) The Committee\u2019s views**\n-----------------------------\n\n***(i) Introduction***\n----------------------\n\n206.\n\nArgentina claims that grounds of annulment exist, first, by virtue of the Tribunal\u2019s *\"denial of fundamental evidence\",* and secondly, by virtue of the Tribunal\u2019s *\"failure to consider key arguments\".* The Committee will consider each of these in turn.\n\n***(ii) Argentina\u2019s claim of \"denial of fundamental evidence\"***\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n207.\n\nArgentina\u2019s claim of \"denial of fundamental evidence\" concerns the Tribunal\u2019s response to a number of requests, made by Argentina to the Tribunal during the course of the proceedings, for the Tribunal to exercise its power under Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2)(a) to call upon Azurix for the production of certain documents.\n\n208.\n\nAs is clear from their terms each provision states that the power is discretionary as one that the tribunal \"may\" exercise, *\"at any stage of the proceeding\"*. Neither provision makes the exercise of the power contingent upon a request being made to the tribunal by one of the parties; hence the power may be exercised by the tribunal of its own motion. There is nothing to prevent the tribunal from exercising the power pursuant to a request by a party, but conversely, there is nothing to require the tribunal to accede to any such request. Nor does either of these provisions lay down the criteria to be considered by the tribunal when deciding whether to exercise this power. The discretion of the tribunal in the exercise of this power is unfettered.\n\n209.\n\nBecause the unfettered nature of the discretion, there is a potentially wide range of considerations to which the tribunal might legitimately have regard in deciding whether to exercise that power pursuant to a request of a party, such as the timing of the request, the importance of the documents to an identified issue, the relevance of the identified issue to the determination of the dispute, the reasonableness of the scope of the request and, in particular, whether the other party objects to the request, and if so, the nature and basis for those objections.\n\n210.\n\nBecause the power is discretionary, a decision by a tribunal not to accede to a party\u2019s request to exercise that power can never, in and of itself, be a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. A decision by a tribunal whether or not to exercise a discretionary power that it has under a rule of procedure is an *exercise* of that rule of procedure, and not a *departure from* that rule of procedure. It is only where the exercise of that discretion, in all of the circumstances of the case, amounts to a serious departure from another rule of procedure of a fundamental nature that there will be grounds for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n211.\n\nArgentina invokes two fundamental rules of procedure which it claims have been violated as a result of the Tribunal\u2019s response to Argentina\u2019s requests for the production of documents. These are, first, Argentina\u2019s \"right of defence\", and secondly, \"the principle of equality of the parties\".\n\n212.\n\nAs to the \"right of defence\", the Committee notes that in the *Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision it was said that:\n\n*[Article 57(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention] refers to a set of minimal standards of procedure to be respected as a matter of international law. It is fundamental, as a matter of procedure, that each party is given the right to be heard before an independent and impartial tribunal. This includes the right to stake its claim more its defence and to produce all arguments and evidence in support of it. This fundamental right has to be ensured on an equal level, in a way that allows each party to respond adequately to the arguments and evidence presented by the other.''160*\n\nSubsequent ICSID case law has affirmed these propositions.161\n\n*Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6 57.\n\n*MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 49; *CDC* Annulment Decision \u00b6 49.\n\n213.\n\nAs to the \"principle of equality of the parties\", the Committee notes that in the *MINE* Annulment decision, it was said that:\n\n*The Committee considers that a clear example of such a fundamental rule is to be found in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration which provides:*\n\n*The parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given full opportunity of presenting his* case.162\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6 5.06. See also, for instance, *Metalpar S.A. and Buen Aire S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/5, Award, June 6, 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 153-155.\n\n214.\n\nThe Committee notes that, additionally, it was observed in the *Kl\u00f4ckner* Annulment Decision that:\n\n*Impartiality of an arbitrator is a fundamental and essential requirement. Any shortcoming in this regard, that is any sign of partiality, must be considered to constitute, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d), a \"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\" in the broad sense of the term \"procedure,\" i.e., a serious departure from a* *fundamental rule of arbitration in general, and of ICSID arbitration in particular.163*\n\n*Kl\u00f4ckner* Annulment Decision \u00b6 95\n\n215.\n\nHowever, in the Committee\u2019s view, in the ICSID system, none of these fundamental rules of procedure imply a *right* of a party to obtain evidence in the hands of the opposing party. In its letter dated August 2, 2004, Argentina refers to what it claims is \"a *general principle of law that the party that is in a better position to prove a fact bears the burden of proof'* (see paragraph 198 above). The Committee does not accept that such general principle exists in ICSID proceedings: to the contrary, the Committee considers the general principle in ICSID proceedings, and in international adjudication generally, to be that \"who asserts must prove\", and that in order to do so, the party which asserts must itself obtain and present the necessary evidence in order to prove what it asserts.\n\n216.\n\nThere are no provisions in the ICSID Convention or ICSID Arbitration Rules providing for any particular regime of discovery or disclosure of documents by one party to another. It is well known that different national legal systems take different approaches to the question of discovery and disclosure of documents, and these differences have also been reflected in diverging attitudes in international commercial arbitrations. As was stated in the *Noble Ventures* Award:\n\n*Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2)(a)...do not provide a basis for the application of national rules of discovery such as those of the United States Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or those for the District of Columbia...*\n\n*The Tribunal recognises that, on one hand, requests and orders regarding the production of documents are today a regular feature of international arbitration... but, on the other hand, the present arbitration is a case between a Government of a Civil Law country where production of documents is used far less than in Common Law countries from where the investor comes....*\n\n*The Tribunal further recognises that, on one hand, ordering the production of documents can be helpful in the Tribunal\u2019s task of establishing the facts of the case relevant for the issues to be decided, but, on the other hand, (1) the process of discovery and disclosure may be time-consuming, excessively burdensome and even oppressive and that unless carefully limited, the burden may be disproportionate to the value of the result, and (2) Parties may have a legitimate interest of confidentiality.*\n\n*... Finally the Tribunal notes that, insofar as a Party has the burden of proof, it is sufficient for the other Party to deny what the respective Party has alleged and then, later in the procedure, respond to and rebut the evidence provided by that respective Party to comply with its burden of proof.164*\n\n*Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11, Award, October 12, 2005 \u00b6 20.\n\n217.\n\nThe Committee finds that the fundamental rules of procedure referred to above do not require any particular regime of discovery or disclosure to be applied by a tribunal, and do not confer any particular right on a party to compel the production of evidence by the opposing party. The extent to which the tribunal does call upon one party to produce documents at the request of another party will always be a matter for the tribunal to determine in its discretion.\n\n218.\n\nArgentina is correct when it argues that under the ICSID Arbitration Rules, a party is not required to make a request for evidence at any particular time, and is not required to tailor its requests for evidence to the points to which the evidence would be directed, and is not under an obligation to explain why the documents are relevant and material to the outcome of the case. However, matters such as the timing of the request for evidence, and whether the request is sufficiently precise in identifying the requested evidence and the reasons why it is needed, are matters that the tribunal is entitled to, and in practice no doubt normally will, take into account in deciding how to exercise its discretion. It is not the case that a party has the right to demand any evidence at any time without justification. Even where a request is timely, precise and justified, the tribunal may in its discretion reject the request. Where the request is not timely, precise and justified, the tribunal is even more likely to do so.\n\n219.\n\nThe Committee finds that a party cannot, simply by requesting the tribunal to call upon the other party to produce documents which are said to be relevant to a particular allegation, mandate the tribunal either to require the production of those documents or to accept the truth of the allegation in default of production. A tribunal might in its discretion refuse the request to require the documents to be produced, and ultimately find the asserted fact not to be proved. Regardless of whether or not the tribunal decides to call upon a party to produce documents, it will decide all of the issues on the basis of the evidence before it. That is not to deny that in some circumstances a tribunal\u2019s refusal to exercise its power under Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2)(a) at the request of a party could amount to a denial of a party\u2019s right to be heard. However, the fact that the tribunal decides to exercise its discretion one way rather than the other cannot in itself be an annullable error. To establish an annullable error, it is not sufficient to show that the tribunal rejected repeated requests for the production of evidence that the requesting party considered crucial to its case. Rather, it is necessary to establish that, in all of the circumstances there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n220.\n\nIn the present case, Argentina, in its Counter Memorial, requested the Tribunal to call upon Azurix to produce certain documents, including a copy of the documentation filed with the Province for participating in the Bidding Process (\"Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2\"). Azurix objected on the grounds referred to in paragraph 202 above. Argentina subsequently stated that Argentina would have no problem in requesting the Province to produce evidence that the Tribunal considered relevant (see paragraph 189 above). The Tribunal then adopted Procedural Order No. 2, in which the Tribunal invited Argentina to request the Province to provide it with Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2, and decided to postpone consideration of the remainder of Argentina\u2019s request until after the filing of Azurix\u2019s Reply, which was then due in little more than 2 weeks.\n\n221.\n\nIn circumstances where Argentina had stated that it would have no problem in requesting the Province to produce the evidence that Argentina was seeking to obtain, and where Azurix had objected to Argentina\u2019s request, the Committee does not see how it could be regarded as a departure from any fundamental rule of procedure for the Tribunal to have proceeded as it did.\n\n222.\n\nBy letters dated May 17 and 20, 2004, Argentina subsequently informed the Tribunal that it was sending the Tribunal copies of Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2 that it had obtained from the Province, but requested the Tribunal not to send a copy of this documentation to Azurix until Azurix had produced its own copy of Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2 (see paragraph 202 above). By Procedural Order No. 3, the Tribunal acceded to this request of Argentina, and this action by the Tribunal cannot be the subject of complaint by Argentina.\n\n223.\n\nBy letter to the Tribunal dated May 31, 2004, Argentina stated that it was withdrawing its request for Azurix to provide its own copies of Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2. Argentina claimed that this was because Azurix\u2019s conduct had made Argentina\u2019s request futile, and Argentina requested the Tribunal to take this into account. By a letter from the Secretary of the Tribunal dated June 7, 2004 (paragraph 202 above), the parties were informed that the Tribunal took note of Argentina\u2019s withdrawal of its request for Azurix to produce Envelopes Nos. 1 and 2, and that the Tribunal *\"will consider the relevance of the matters raised in said communications as part of its overall examination of the submissions by the parties in this case\".* The Tribunal thereby effectively acceded to Argentina\u2019s request, and this action by the Tribunal also cannot be the subject of complaint by Argentina.\n\n224.\n\nBy letter to the Tribunal dated July 22, 2004, Argentina requested the Tribunal to order the submission of the evidence requested by Argentina in its Counter Memorial that was not covered by Procedural Order No. 3. Azurix opposed this request. It its Procedural Order No. 4, the Tribunal, noting that it had now had the opportunity to review Azurix\u2019s reply, declined this request of Argentina *\"because of its general nature and failure to justify it on the basis of the reasons adduced\u2019.*\n\n225.\n\nThe original request for the production of evidence made in Argentina\u2019s Counter Memorial, and the relevant parts of Argentina\u2019s letter of July 22, 2004 are set out in paragraphs 186-187 and 196 above. The Committee considers that the Tribunal was acting within its discretion in declining Argentina\u2019s request on the ground that it did, and the Committee is therefore not satisfied that it is established that in the circumstances there was a breach of any fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n226.\n\nBy a letter dated August 2, 2004, the stated purpose of which was *\"to justify in more detail the request for evidence made by this Office and make it more precise\",* Argentina requested that Azurix be called upon to produce one specific document, the HYTSA Report, and two general categories of documents (see paragraph 198 above). The justification for the request was that the requested documents were aimed at confirming that the offer submitted by Azurix in the bidding process was *\"aggressive and opportunistic\"* and that it related to the imminent IPO by Azurix (see paragraph 198 above). In its Procedural Order No. 5, the Tribunal rejected this request, stating that *\"it fails to be adequately justified since it continues to be based on the amount paid by the concession and accepted by the Province\".* Although the reasons given in this Procedural Order are not very detailed, the Committee considers it sufficiently clear that because the Province had accepted the amount offered by Azurix for the Concession, the Tribunal could not see the relevance of the reasons that Azurix may have had for offering the price that it did. Having regard to the justifications that had been advanced by Argentina in all of its requests for the production of documents, the Committee considers that it was within the discretion of the Tribunal to reject Argentina\u2019s request on the basis that it did.\n\n227.\n\nBy letter to the Tribunal dated August 23, 2004, Argentina requested the Tribunal *\"to reconsider Respondent\u2019s request for evidence so as to preserve the Argentine Republic\u2019s right of defence in these arbitration proceedings\"* (see paragraph 200 above). That letter stated, *inter alia,* that *\"Argentina has sufficiently proven\"* certain facts, and that *\"[i]n addition to producing its own evidence, the Argentine Republic requested the Tribunal to order Azurix Corp, to produce the documents in its possession, in order to confirm what had already been proven by Respondent\u2019.*\n\n228.\n\nOn September 9, 2004, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, in which it said that it had considered anew Argentina\u2019s request and had now had the opportunity to review the Rejoinder, and in which it decided to request Azurix to submit the HYTSA Report and to request Argentina to submit the bid evaluation reports related to each stage of the bidding for the Concession.\n\n229.\n\nThe Committee sees no contradiction in the Tribunal\u2019s decision (in Procedural Order No. 6) to call upon Azurix to produce the HYTSA Report, having previously declined to do so in Procedural Order No. 5. The text of Procedural Order No. 6 indicates that, since the previous order, the Tribunal had had the opportunity to review Argentina\u2019s Rejoinder, and it is necessarily implicit in the latter order that this influenced the Tribunal\u2019s change in position. In any event, the Tribunal, by calling upon Azurix to produce the HYTSA Report, thereby acceded to a request by Argentina, and in the Committee\u2019s view this action by the Tribunal cannot be the subject of complaint by Argentina.\n\n230.\n\nArgentina claims that it received the HYTSA Report too late for it to be used by Argentina in the oral arguments in the case. The Committee notes, however, that the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 6 was the result of Argentina\u2019s request dated August 23, 2006. Procedural Order No. 6 was issued just over 2 weeks after Argentina\u2019s request, and that order required production of the HYTSA Report within some 8 days of the date of the order. The Committee therefore considers that the Tribunal responded promptly to Argentina\u2019s request, and that the timing of Argentina\u2019s receipt of the Report was a function of the timing of Argentina\u2019s request. In any event, if Argentina considered itself to be materially prejudiced by the timing of its receipt of the Report, it could have applied to the Tribunal for appropriate relief, including (for instance) by applying for a postponement of the oral arguments if it considered this to be necessary. In the material before the Committee, there is no suggestion that Argentina ever sought any relief from the Tribunal in this respect. The Committee considers that Argentina, having failed to do so, cannot now claim that there has been a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure that would justify annulment.\n\n231.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6 also requested Argentina to produce the bid evaluation reports related to each stage of the bidding. It is not clear from the material before the Committee whether the Tribunal was requested by either party to call for the production of this evidence. However, the Committee considers this to be immaterial, since the power under Article 43(a) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2)(a) may be exercised on the Tribunal\u2019s own motion. The Tribunal\u2019s decision to call for the production of certain evidence that the Tribunal deemed necessary clearly cannot amount to a \"fundamental denial of evidence\".\n\n232.\n\nProcedural Order No. 6 rejected Argentina\u2019s request for the production of the documents referred to in paragraph 198(b) and (c) above. The Committee finds that this was consistent with Procedural Order No. 5, and finds, for the same reasons given in respect of Procedural Order No. 5 above, that this decision did not depart from any fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n233.\n\nAs to Argentina\u2019s claim that the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Orders No. 2 to No. 6 did not treat the parties equally, the Committee observes that the fact that a request by one party is allowed while a request by another party is denied does not mean that there has been an inequality in the treatment of the parties. Each request by each party must be considered and determined by the tribunal on its own individual merits. It is only where it can be shown that a tribunal has applied inconsistent standards in the way that it has treated the requests of the different parties that there can be said to be inequality of treatment. On the basis of the material before it, the Committee considers that there are no grounds for suggesting that the Tribunal did anything other than consider each party\u2019s requests on their own merits, and that there are no grounds for suggesting there was any inequality of treatment of the parties.\n\n234.\n\nThe Committee also notes that in order to be a \"serious\" departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.165 The only evidence which Argentina ultimately sought to have produced that the Tribunal failed to call upon Azurix to provide were the documents referred to in paragraph 198(b) and (c) above. As to the relevance of these documents to the case, Argentina stated in its Memorial on Annulment that:\n\n*... one of Argentina\u2019s key allegations was that there had been irregularities in the bidding process. The importance of this contention lied in preventing Azurix from invoking illegitimate expectations.*\n\nand that:\n\n*Demonstrating the existence of those irregularities was important for preventing Azurix from invoking expectations based on the already mentioned circulars and articles, especially Circular No. 52(A) and Article 12.1.1 of the Concession Contract.*\n\nSee above paragraphs 49-52.\n\n235.\n\nOn the material before it, it is not apparent to the Committee that in its defences to the claims Argentina invoked the principle that claims based on contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld by an arbitral tribunal. Nor is it apparent to the Committee that Argentina \u2019\u2019specifically\" or \"in terms\" claimed that the documents it requested would establish that the contract had been obtained by corruption. Rather, the position of Argentina appears to have been that \"irregularities\" in the bidding process would prevent Azurix from relying on \"expectations\" based on particular provisions of the Concession Agreement, in particular Circular No. 52(A) and Article 12.1.1 of the Concession Agreement.\n\n236.\n\nHowever, in any event, the Tribunal noted that:\n\n*... the Procurador General present at the hearing confirmed that the investigation was continuing but that no evidence of improper conduct had surfaced. No further information has been transmitted to the Tribunal.166*\n\nOn the basis of the material before it, the Committee is not satisfied that there is any justification for concluding that it was reasonably likely that the documents requested by Argentina, had they been available in the proceedings, would have established that the Concession Agreement was obtained by corruption.\n\nAward \u00b6 56.\n\n237.\n\nAs to irregularities falling short of corruption, the Committee finds that the Tribunal expressly took Argentina\u2019s arguments into account.167 It is true that the Tribunal appears to have made no express findings as to whether or not such irregularities had in fact been established. However, the Committee regards it as implicit in the Award that the Tribunal considered that any such irregularities would not have invalidated the Concession Agreement or have affected Azurix\u2019s right to invoke the protections of the BIT in respect of its investment.168 The controversy over Circular No. 52(A) and Article 12.1.1 of the Concession Agreement went to the issue of Canon recovery.169 The Tribunal ultimately resolved that issue in Argentina\u2019s favour,170 and also found that the value of the Concession was only a fraction of what Azurix had paid for it. Thus, the Committee finds it to be implicit from the Award that, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, any such irregularities, even if they had been established, would not have affected the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\nAward especially \u00b6\u00b6 23, 25, 201,203, 209, 242.\n\nSee especially Award \u00b6 242.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6195-243.\n\nSee especially Award \u00b6\u00b6 219-243.\n\n238.\n\nOn the basis of the material before it, the Committee is therefore not satisfied that there is any basis for concluding that it was reasonably likely that the documents requested by Argentina, had they been available in the proceedings, would have caused the Tribunal to reach a substantially different result.\n\n239.\n\nThe Committee therefore rejects Argentina\u2019s argument based on \"denial of fundamental evidence\".\n\n***(iii) Argentina\u2019s claim of \"failure to consider key arguments\"***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n240.\n\nIn addressing Argentina\u2019s contention that the Tribunal failed to consider certain of its key arguments, the Committee recalls the *Vivendi* Annulment Decision where it was said that:\n\n*No doubt an ICSID tribunal is not required to address in its award every argument made by the parties, provided of course that the arguments which it actually does consider are themselves capable of leading to the conclusion reached by the tribunal and that all questions submitted to a tribunal are expressly or implicitly dealt with.171*\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6 87; *MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 50; *Lucchetti* Annulment Decision \u00b6 128; *Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 81-83; *Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 121-128; *CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 53-57; *MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6 5.09.\n\n241.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, in disregarding the existence of irregularities in the bidding process without explaining why, and in particular, in failing to explain why it did not give heed to Azurix\u2019s breach of Procedural Order No. 3.\n\n242.\n\nFor the reasons given in paragraph 237 above, the Committee considers that it is apparent that the Tribunal took Argentina\u2019s arguments concerning alleged irregularities in the bidding process into account.\n\n243.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal failed to take properly into account Azurix\u2019s alleged breach of Procedural Order No. 3. The Committee notes that the parties were informed by the letter dated June 7, 2004 that the Tribunal would consider the relevance of the matters raised by Argentina in its letter of May 20, 2004 as part of its overall examination of the submissions by the parties in the case. The Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal must have done so, even if it did not make express or detailed findings on those matters in the Award itself. The fact that the Tribunal ultimately ordered Azurix to pay the Argentina\u2019s costs related to the \"procedural incident\" of Azurix\u2019s failure to submit its copies of Envelopes No. 1 and No. 2 as required by Procedural Order No. 3172 is further confirmation that the Tribunal did take Argentina\u2019s submissions in respect of this incident into account. Argentina\u2019s argument was in essence that Azurix\u2019s alleged breach of Procedural Order No. 3 deprived Argentina of the opportunity to obtain further evidence of irregularities in the bidding process. For the reasons given in paragraph 237 above, the Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal did not consider it material whether or not there had been irregularities in the bidding process. Accordingly, it would not have been material whether or not Azurix had breached Procedural Order No. 3.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 441,442.7.\n\n244.\n\nArgentina argues that it was a part of its case that, because Azurix needed to win the bidding process in order for its upcoming IPO to be successful, it made an unreasonable offer in the bidding process, expecting later to renegotiate the terms of the Concession Agreement. The Committee notes that the Tribunal ultimately found that *\"no well-informed investor, in March 2002\"* would have paid what Azurix had paid for the Concession, and that for the purposes of assessing damages the Tribunal therefore took into account less than a sixth of what Azurix had actually paid. The Committee considers that the Tribunal thereby agreed with Argentina\u2019s claim that Azurix had paid an unreasonably large amount for the Concession. The Committee further finds it implicit from the Award as a whole that the Tribunal did not consider it to be material to its decision exactly *why* Azurix had done so. The Committee finds that it is not a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure for a tribunal to decline to consider an issue that it considers to be irrelevant, merely because one of the parties considers it to be important. For the reasons given in paragraph 237 above, the Committee is not persuaded that the Tribunal failed to consider Argentina\u2019s argument that, because of the alleged irregularities in the bidding process, Azurix was not entitled to any compensation at all.\n\n245.\n\nArgentina also contends that the Tribunal failed to mention the evidence submitted by Argentina in order to show the existence of the relationship between Azurix and Enron. The Committee considers that it is implicit in the Award, including for the reasons given in the previous paragraph, that the Tribunal did not consider Azurix\u2019s relationship to Enron to be material to its decision in the case. At paragraph 55 of the Award, the Tribunal refers expressly to Argentina\u2019s arguments concerning the relationship between Azurix and Enron. The Committee is not persuaded that the Tribunal failed to consider these arguments. The Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal considered and rejected them.\n\n246.\n\nThe Committee therefore rejects Argentina\u2019s argument based on \"failure to consider key arguments\".\n\n**(g) Other ground of annulment advanced by Argentina**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nArgentina has also argued that *\"Procedural Orders No. 2 to 6, signed by the President of the Tribunal, took a new meaning in the context of the proposal to disqualify Mr. Rigo Sureda\".* This contention is considered by the Committee in connection with its consideration of Argentina\u2019s subsequent ground of annulment below.\n\n**(h) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n248.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee rejects Argentina\u2019s grounds of annulment based on the Tribunal\u2019s alleged denial of fundamental evidence and failure to consider key arguments.\n\n**G. Alleged conflict of interest and lack of independent judgment**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n249.\n\nArgentina claims that the Tribunal was not properly constituted, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention, on account of the fact that the President of the Tribunal, Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda, was *\"immersed in various conflicts of interest\u2019* which *\"cast reasonable doubts on his impartiality\",* such that *\"it was not possible for an objective observer to be confident that he could be \u2018relied upon to exercise independent judgment\"\u2019.*\n\n250.\n\nSuch doubts are claimed by Argentina to be reinforced by certain procedural orders adopted by the President of the Tribunal which, according to Argentina, denied evidence essential to Argentina\u2019s defence.\n\n251.\n\nThe conflicts of interest in which Dr. Rigo Sureda is said by Argentina to have been immersed are claimed to arise by virtue of three circumstances, namely:\n\n(a) the fact that Dr. Rigo Sureda was employed as a consultant to the United States law firm, Fulbright & Jaworski LLP (\"Fulbright\"), which was representing the claimant in the case of *Duke Energy International Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd v. Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28) (\"the *Duke* case\"), in which Fulbright appointed as arbitrator Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil, one of the counsel for Azurix in the present case;\n\n(b) the fact that Fulbright provided legal advice to Azurix on other matters, including while the arbitration in the present case was in progress; and\n\n(c) the fact that Fulbright participated in matters related to Enron, which was Azurix\u2019s parent company.\n\n252.\n\nIn its Reply on Annulment, Argentina contended that there are seven main reasons why Dr. Rigo Sureda could not be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and did not inspire full confidence in his impartiality of judgment, namely:\n\n(a) the crossed roles played by Dr. Rigo Sureda and Dr. Santiago Tawil;\n\n(b) Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s failure to disclose that he had participated in the *Duke* case until after Argentina had proposed his disqualification;\n\n(c) Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s provision of misleading information with regard to his knowledge about Dr. Santiago Tawil\u2019s appointment in the *Duke* case;\n\n(d) the attorney-client relationships between Fulbright and Azurix and Fulbright and Enron;\n\n(e) Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s failure to investigate despite the fact that Argentina enquired about the possible attorney-client relationship between Fulbright and Enron as from Argentina\u2019s proposal to disqualify Dr. Rigo Sureda;\n\n(f) Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s resignation from Fulbright; and\n\n(g) the denial of evidence requested by Argentina in the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Orders Nos. 2 to 6.\n\n253.\n\nArgentina also contends that, by virtue of these conflicts of interest there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**(b) Background**\n------------------\n\n254.\n\nBy letter dated March 27, 2002 the ICSID Secretariat Informed Argentina and Azurix that Dr. Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda was being considered for appointment as the presiding arbitrator in this case. That letter stated that Dr. Rigo Sureda had informed the ICSID Secretariat that the law firm to which he was advisor, Fulbright, was at the time representing several parties in matters against Enron Corp, but that he had not and would not participate in any of these matters and would take the necessary steps to ensure that he would be isolated from them. The letter requested the parties to indicate whether they had any objections to his appointment.\n\n255.\n\nBy letter dated April 8, 2002, the ICSID Secretariat informed Argentina and Azurix that Dr. Rigo Sureda had accepted appointment as President of the Tribunal in this case, and that in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Tribunal was deemed to have been constituted and the proceedings to have begun on that date.\n\n256.\n\nBy letter dated March 30, 2004 Dr. Guido Santiago Tawil of M & M Bomchil Abogados, one of the counsel for Azurix, informed Argentina that he had been appointed as arbitrator in the *Duke* case.173 The letter stated that, prior to accepting such nomination, he considered it relevant to inform Argentina that Dr. Rigo Sureda had previously been part of the legal team that was acting for the claimant in the *Duke* case, but that Dr. Rigo Sureda did not participate in the selection procedure that led to Dr. Santiago Tawil\u2019s appointment as arbitrator in that case and that Dr. Rigo Sureda no longer participated in the *Duke* case. The letter requested Argentina\u2019s consent for Dr. Santiago Tawil to accept his nomination as arbitrator in the *Duke* case.\n\nSee above paragraph 251.\n\n257.\n\nIn a letter to Dr. Santiago Tawil dated April 13, 2004 the Argentine Attorney-General\u2019s Office stated that:\n\n*Since the Republic of Argentina is absolutely unrelated to the case and bearing in mind, also, that the intervention of the head of this Office has been required on the grounds of* *professional ethics and politeness, due to the fact that you are a member of the Law Firm M&M BOMCHIL abogados-adversary to the Republic of Argentina in the cases SIEMENS AG and AZURIX Corp, which acting Tribunals are presided over by a member of the Law Firm who nominated you as arbitrator in [the* Duke *case]... it is unnecessary for this Office to deliver a formal decision regarding your presentation.*\n\n258.\n\nBy letter dated April 13, 2004 Dr. Santiago Tawil informed the ICSID Secretariat that he accepted his nomination as arbitrator in the *Duke* case, advised the ICSID Secretariat of the above matters and stated that *\"[p]rior to this letter I have disclosed these facts before the Argentine Republic, who has made no objection in such respect\u2019.*\n\n259.\n\nIn a letter to the ICSID Secretariat dated May 17, 2004 Dr. Rigo Sureda stated that he had learned of the appointment of Dr. Santiago Tawil as arbitrator in the *Duke* case, and said that:\n\n*Since Mr Tawil is counsel to the claimants in the cases of* Siemens v. Argentina *and* Azurix v. Argentina, *cases in which I chair the arbitral tribunal, I wish to confirm to you that I had no involvement in the selection of Mr Tawil as an arbitrator [in the* Duke *case], nor will I have any involvement with the representation of Duke Energy International by Fulbright & Jaworski.*\n\n260.\n\nOn November 29, 2004 Argentina filed a proposal to disqualify Dr. Rigo Sureda pursuant to Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention (the \"Disqualification Proposal\"). That proposal stated, *inter alia,* that:\n\n*Mr Rigo Sureda is the President of two ICSID arbitration panels in cases against the Argentine Republic. In such cases Mr Tawil is co-counsel for the claimants. In addition,* *Mr Tawil was appointed arbitrator by Mr Rigo Sureda\u2019s law firm in a case where such law firm is counsel for claimant.* *Mr Rigo Sureda and Mr Tawil are reciprocally arbitrators and parties.*\n\n*In addition, Mr Rigo Sureda did not comply with the duty to inform the Tribunal and the parties of the clear supervening situation that might give rise to evident incompatibility. Moreover, according to the letter from Mr Tawil to the* *Argentine Republic, it would appear that Mr Rigo Sureda participated in the case where Mr Tawil was appointed as arbitrator.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Mr Rigo Sureda\u2019s professional and financial interests in Fulbright & Jaworsky have been subjected to Mr Tawil\u2019s authority in the arbitration proceedings where the latter serves as arbitrator. In turn, Mr Guido Tawil is co-counsel for claimant in the present case. Mr Rigo Sureda is the President of the Tribunal in a case initiated by a company represented by Mr Tawil.*\n\n*The particular position in which Mr Rigo Sureda has been placed in connection with these arbitration proceedings, his law firm and Mr Tawil \u2014 not only objectively but also considering the appearance of these relationships \u2014 provides the Argentine Republic \u2014 and any reasonable individual \u2014 with enough reasons to conclude that Mr Rigo Sureda\u2019s independence and impartiality have been impaired.*\n\n*So far, Mr Rigo Sureda has not informed what his professional and business interests and relationships with Duke were and are.*\n\n*Mr Rigo Sureda did not inform the parties about the supervening situation and limited himself to sending a letter to the ICSID\u2019s Deputy Secretary-General, Antonio Parra, informing about Mr Tawil\u2019s appointment as arbitrator in a case where his law firm is actively involved. This letter was forwarded to the Argentine Republic.*\n\n*This information does not even meet the basic transparency and information duty that a president of an arbitral panel is required to comply with. In addition, according to Mr Tawil\u2019s letter, it would appear that Mr Rigo Sureda participated in the Duke case in the past.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*Mr Rigo Sureda had a full, comprehensive, and detailed disclosure duty and he has breached such duty. It is not the Argentine Republic that should request the information, but the arbitrator himself who must have provided it in a timely manner.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The persistent withholding of information on the part of Mr Rigo Sureda increases the appearance and/or objective perception of partiality or bias. This is in itself a valid reason for a request for disqualification; even more so under the ICSID Convention standard. The same conclusion is reached by analysing other significant arbitration ethics rules.*\n\n261.\n\nIn a letter dated December 10, 2004 addressed to the other two members of the Tribunal, Dr. Rigo Sureda furnished explanations to the Tribunal pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9.\n\n262.\n\nIn a communication dated December 17, 2004, Azurix responded to the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n263.\n\nIn a communication dated December 30, 2004, Argentina responded to Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s letter.\n\n264.\n\nBy a letter dated January 28, 2005 Azurix informed the ICSID Secretariat as follows:\n\n*After Mr Rigo was appointed President of the Tribunal in this matter, the officers and internal counsel of Azurix changed. In November 2002, the new offices and internal counsel of as Azurix Corp, (who were unaware of Mr.* *Rigo\u2019s relationship with Fulbright) engaged a Houston partner of Fulbright to provide advice on a limited engagement for the few months on a matter completely unrelated to this arbitration. That engagement did not involve the Argentine Republic or any project in Argentina and specifically had nothing to do with the Buenos Aries or Mendoza Province water systems or concessions or Azurix\u2019s subsidiaries in Argentina...*\n\n*That engagement was concluded by April 2003. Mr Rigo was not involved in that engagement since it included only lawyers in Fulbright\u2019s Houston office...*\n\n*This disclosure stems from the very recent realization of an officer of Azurix...*\n\n*In addition, although the Fulbright was adverse to Enron in several matters in April 2002, it was also representing through one of its Houston partners 16 pipeline companies in litigation with the United States Army Core of Engineers... including Florida Gas Transmission Company, which was an affiliate of Enron until late 2004. It had no relationship with Argentina, and Mr. Rigo was not involved in any way.*\n\n265.\n\nBy a communication dated February 1, 2005 Argentina responded to Azurix\u2019s communication of January 28, 2005 and stated that it was confirming and presenting new elements with respect to the disqualification of Dr. Rigo Sureda. That communication said *inter alia* that statements made in Azurix\u2019s communication of January 28, 2005 constituted a new fact to disqualify Dr. Rigo Sureda and confirmed the validity of the merits.\n\n266.\n\nBy a letter dated February 1, 2005 Dr. Rigo Sureda stated *inter alia* that he had no role in or knowledge of any of the matters disclosed in Azurix\u2019s communication of January 28, 2005, and that, on receipt of the letter, he had decided to resign from Fulbright with immediate effect so that he would serve as President of the Tribunal *\"in a capacity of unquestionable independence unaffected by events of which I have no knowledge or information and over which I have no control'.*\n\n267.\n\nBy a communication dated February 10, 2005, Argentina stated that it ratified its request for disqualification, and that it was furnishing new evidence for admissibility of that request. That communication stated *inter alia* that the resignation of Dr. Rigo Sureda from Fulbright implied recognition of the fact that he was not in a position to act with impartiality or undeniable independence, that the information provided on March 27, 2002 was irrelevant, that Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s statement was obscure, untimely and nontransparent, that Dr. Rigo Sureda had acknowledged that Fulbright was currently linked to Enron, and that the resignation of Dr. Rigo Sureda from Fulbright could neither restore the absolute confidence in his independence and impartiality nor wipe out the violation to the duty of disclosure and transparency. That communication also stated that in the procedural orders of the Tribunal (as to which, see paragraph 254 above), Dr. Rigo Sureda *\"unfairly kept a tight hold on the evidence requested in this proceeding by the Republic of Argentina\",* and that the expressions of Dr. Rigo Sureda in the procedural orders *\"acquire today a new meaning in the light of the facts and circumstances that relate the law firm of Fulbright & Jaworski with Mr. Rigo Sureda and Azurix Corp\".*\n\n268.\n\nOn February 25, 2005, the other two members of the Tribunal, Mr. Lalonde and Mr. Martins, issued their \"Decision on the Challenge of the President of the Tribunal\" (the \"Disqualification Decision\"), in which they rejected Argentina\u2019s proposal to disqualify Dr. Rigo Sureda.\n\n269.\n\nThe Disqualification Decision found that the Disqualification Proposal had to fail for procedural grounds, on the basis that Argentina had failed to *\"state promptly its objections\"* as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 27. This was because it was found that Argentina was made aware of the facts on which the Disqualification Proposal was based as early as March 30, 2004, but that Argentina did not propose the disqualification of Dr. Rigo Sureda until November 29, 2004, some eight months later. The Disqualification Decision rejected an argument that the new Attorney-General of Argentina had only been informed of the matter recently, on the basis that the right to object did not belong to the Attorney General *in persona* but to the Argentine Republic. The Disqualification Decision therefore concluded that Argentina was deemed to have waived its right to request the disqualification of Dr. Rigo Sureda.\n\n270.\n\nThe Disqualification Decision also found that the Disqualification Proposal had to fail for substantive reasons. It was considered that the procedural orders were at the time taken by the three members of the Tribunal and not by the President alone and that these procedural orders had no bearing on the issue of disqualification raised by Argentina. The Disqualification Decision found that, based on the facts presented by Argentina in connection with the *Duke* case, there was no *\"real risk of lack of impropriety\u2019* that would *\"negate or place in clear doubt the lack of impartiality.* In the Disqualification Decision, the other two members of the Tribunal also found that they could not conclude that Dr. Rigo Sureda was in any way delinquent in the application of his information and transparency duty. The Disqualification Decision additionally considered that the new facts presented in Argentina\u2019s letter of February 1, 2005 were not sufficient to lead to the conclusion that Dr. Rigo Sureda should be disqualified as President of the Tribunal.\n\n271.\n\nBy a letter dated April 4, 2005 to the ICSID Secretariat, Argentina stated that it *\"rais[ed] a formal objection to the rejection of Argentina\u2019s proposal to disqualify Mr Rigo Sureda\",* which was said to *\"infringe [...] Argentina\u2019s essential rights and guarantees recognised in the ICSID Convention\".*\n\n**(c) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n272.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) The Disqualification Decision contains significant errors and defects, which lead to the conclusion that the President\u2019s disqualification was incorrectly rejected.\n\n(i) The Disqualification Decision concluded that the letter from the ICSID Secretariat dated March 27, 2002, had provided Argentina with enough information for it to raise an objection to Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s appointment. However, that letter only stated that Dr. Rigo Sureda had disclosed that Fulbright was representing several parties in matters *against* Enron, while the Disqualification Proposal and comments of December 30, 2004 had requested information regarding a possible attorney-client relationship between Fulbright and Enron. It was not until January 28, 2005 that Mr. Bishop disclosed that Florida Gas Transmission Company, which had been an affiliate of Enron until late 2004, had been a client of Fulbright.\n\n(ii) The Disqualification Decision stated that there was no allegation or evidence that Dr. Rigo Sureda had neglected to inform himself or had wilfully withheld information, when in fact Dr. Rigo Sureda appears to have been negligent in his approach and should have investigated the possible client-attorney relationship between Fulbright and Enron, at least as from the moment Argentina raised this issue in its Disqualification Proposal.\n\n(iii) While the Disqualification Decision appeared to adopt an \"apparent bias\" test in determining whether Dr Rigo Sureda\u2019s disqualification was justified, the decision not to disqualify him was inconsistent with the ostensible adoption of the \"apparent bias\" test.\n\n(iv) The Disqualification Decision disregarded the *Pinochet* case174 and the *Commonwealth Coatings* case,175 which Argentina cited in support of its claim.\n\n(b) Although annulment proceedings are not an appeal, the Committee does have the power to decide itself whether the Tribunal was properly constituted, independently of what was decided in that regard in the Disqualification Decision.\n\n(c) The ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention, *\"that the Tribunal was not properly constituted\",* leads to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention which provides that *\"[a] party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\".* Article 14(1) requires that an ICSID arbitrator be a person who, amongst other things, *\"may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment\u2019.*\n\n(d) There is a difference of meaning between the English, French and Spanish texts of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention. The meaning which best reconciles the texts, for purposes of Article 33(4) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which reflects customary international law, is that those designated to serve as arbitrators must be persons who both may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment (or offer every guarantee of independence in exercise of their functions) and inspire full confidence in their impartiality of judgment.\n\n(e) A violation of the right to a fair hearing before an independent, impartial and unbiased tribunal amounts to a *\"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\",* so that if the member of the tribunal cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and/or does not inspire full confidence in his or her impartiality of judgment, the validity of the award may be challenged under both Article 52(1)(a) and Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention. Although these are separate grounds of annulment, the former must be considered as a specific case of the latter.\n\n(f) As to the crossed roles played by Dr. Rigo Sureda and Dr. Santiago Tawil:\n\n(i) each was in a situation where they exercised authority over the other, which lent itself to a *quid pro quo`,*\n\n(ii) it was not until after Argentina made a proposal to disqualify him that Dr. Rigo Sureda revealed that he had assisted two partners in Fulbright in the preparation of the arbitration request in the *Duke* case;\n\n(iii) it is at least doubtful that Dr. Rigo Sureda, as he claims, only learned of Dr. Santiago Tawil\u2019s appointment as arbitrator in the *Duke* case from the ICSID Secretariat.\n\n(g) Argentina did not consent to Dr. Santiago Tawil accepting appointment as arbitrator in the *Duke* case. By its letter of April 13, 2004 Argentina states that it was not for it to give such permission.\n\n(h) Argentina has not waived its right to complain regarding Dr. Santiago Tawil\u2019s role as arbitrator in the *Duke* case through any failure to object in a timely manner, given that ICSID Arbitration Rule 27 does not apply to proposals for disqualification and given that there were new facts between Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s letter of May 17, 2004 and the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n(i) Where an arbitrator is appointed from a large firm which also advises the client, even though the arbitrator may not have been directly involved with the client, other colleagues in the firm would be, and this may raise concerns of conflicts of interest.\n\n(j) Bias can be either actual or apparent. Apparent bias relies on the principle that justice must not only be done but be seen to be done and relies on the concept of justifiable doubts. The existence of justifiable doubts is determined by applying an objective test, which makes it necessary to ask whether a reasonably well-informed person would believe that the perceived apprehension of impartiality is justified.\n\n(k) The word \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention means \"obvious\" or \"evident\" or \"easily understood or recognised by the mind\". The apparent bias test and the test of \"manifest\" in Article 14 of the ICSID Convention do not contradict each other. What must be manifest is that the arbitrator cannot be relied upon to exercise independent judgment or does not inspire full confidence in his or her impartiality of judgment, not that he or she is actually partial or dependent.\n\n(l) The apparent bias test has been adopted in ICSID cases.176 Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention incorporates the test of whether there are reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of an arbitrator.177\n\n(m) The relationships between Fulbright and Azurix, and Fulbright and Enron, fit squarely within the category of cases where the apprehension of bias results from some direct or indirect relationship, experience or contact with a person interested or otherwise involved in the proceedings. Dr. Rigo Sureda played two incompatible roles, namely the role of President of the Tribunal in this case, and the role of senior advisor with Fulbright, which appointed Dr. Santiago Tawil as arbitrator in the *Duke* case and advised Azurix and an affiliate of Enron, Azurix\u2019s parent company.\n\n(n) It cannot be argued that, because Dr. Rigo Sureda was only one of three members of the Tribunal, the ultimate result of the Award would have been the same if he had not served, given that improper constitution of the tribunal compromises the integrity of the entire arbitral process and is a ground of annulment, and given that Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s privileged position as President may have allowed him to sway his fellow arbitrators and his power to issue procedural orders allowed him to shape the entire arbitral process.\n\n(o) The Award favoured Azurix. The fact that the Award rejected some of Azurix\u2019s claims and did not award compensation for the full amount claimed by Azurix is no evidence that Dr. Rigo Sureda could be relied upon to exercise independent judgment and inspired full confidence in his impartiality of judgment.\n\n(\u0440) All of Argentina\u2019s challenges to arbitrators in other cases have been based on justified reasons and have not been dilatory tactics.\n\nArgentina Memorial on Annulment \u00b6167 referring to Disqualification Decision at 15 (Exhibit AR 35).\n\nArgentina Memorial on Annulment \u00b6167 referring to Disqualification Decision at 18.\n\nRelying on *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. & Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on the Challenged to the President of the Committee, Oct. 3, 2001, \u00b6 25; SGS *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision on Claimant\u2019s Proposal to Disqualify Arbitrator of December 19, 2002; *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision of Professor Domingo Bello Janeiro on the Proposal of the Argentine Republic to Disqualify Dr Andr\u00e9s Rigo Sureda Pursuant to Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 9, 11 February 2005, at 26.\n\nArgentina Memorial on Annulment \u00b6193.\n\n273.\n\nAzurix argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) Argentina\u2019s annulment request puts forth merely a disagreement with the Disqualification Decision, which is not a ground for annulment.\n\n(b) Argentina\u2019s numerous unsuccessful challenges to arbitrators in other ICSID and UNCITRAL arbitrations reflects a general strategy to challenge arbitrators whose decisions it does not like and to delay the arbitral process.\n\n(\u0441) Argentina is not entitled to receive a *de novo* review of its challenges to Dr. Rigo Sureda as this would be tantamount to granting Argentina a *de facto* appeal of this issue. Consistent with the ICSID Convention\u2019s approach to annulment on all other grounds, the Committee\u2019s review should be confined to reviewing the Disqualification Decision for manifest error.\n\n(d) For an award to be annulled under Article 52(1), Argentina must prove by objective evidence that Dr. Rigo Sureda had a \"manifest\" lack of the qualities required by Article 14(1). The lack of independence must be \"manifest\" or \"highly probable\" and not just \"possible\".\n\n(e) Argentina does not analyse the facts according to the standard of an independent observer, but merely makes the same assertions already rejected in the Disqualification Decision without presenting new arguments or new facts that would change the Disqualification Decision.\n\n(f) Before accepting appointment as an arbitrator in the *Duke* case, Dr. Santiago Tawil informed Argentina that he was considering accepting the nomination, and Argentina did not object.\n\n(g) While the Disqualification Proposal was pending, Azurix disclosed Fulbright\u2019s limited representation of Azurix and another subsidiary of Enron on unrelated matters as soon as Azurix\u2019s current management and counsel became aware of this. Fulbright had no ongoing relationship with either company. Dr. Rigo Sureda was not involved with or aware of either representation, and resigned from Fulbright to avoid even the appearance of any impropriety which he was not required to do.\n\n(h) The Disqualification Proposal correctly concluded that Argentina had waived its argument based on the alleged relationship between Dr. Rigo Sureda and Dr. Santiago Tawil.\n\n(i) Argentina\u2019s complaint that Dr. Rigo Sureda did not disclose that he had participated in the *Duke* case until after the proposal for disqualification was made is wrong.\n\n(j) Argentina even agreed to have Dr. Rigo Sureda serve as President of another tribunal after it received this disclosure letter.\n\n(k) The Disqualification Decision did not disregard the *Pinochet* and *Commonwealth Coating* cases, but considered both cases inapplicable because of their factual differences and because they were not decided under the standard in the ICSID Convention.\n\n(l) Argentina asserts \"a *veiled and completely unsubstantiated allegation\"* that Dr. Rigo Sureda actually knew of Fulbright\u2019s limited connection with Azurix and an Enron subsidiary and failed to disclose it, which is untrue.\n\n(m) Contrary to what Argentina claims, the \"apparent bias\" test is not the correct standard that the ICSID Convention requires, which is whether Dr. Rigo Sureda could be *\"relied upon to exercise independent judgment\u2019* and whether the facts indicated a *\"manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\".* This is the test that the Disqualification Decision applied.\n\n(n) Although not legally binding on Argentina and Azurix, and although not yet even adopted at the time of Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s appointment as President of the Tribunal in this case, the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest provide additional support for the Disqualification Decision.\n\n(o) Even a cursory review of the unanimous Award and its rejection of many of Azurix\u2019s claims and damages clearly demonstrate independence and a lack of bias by the Tribunal.\n\n(p) As there was no ground to disqualify Dr. Rigo Sureda, there was no *\"serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure\"* in this regard. In any event, as Argentina\u2019s request for annulment did not include this claim, it was waived.\n\n**(d) Improper constitution of the tribunal as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention: applicable principles**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n274.\n\nThe ICSID Convention does not contain provisions specifying when a tribunal will or will not be \"properly constituted\" for the purposes of Article 52(1)(a).\n\n275.\n\nAs a matter of principle, in its interpretation of Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee is guided by Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the \"Vienna Convention\").178\n\nSee paragraphs 83-130 above.\n\n276.\n\nThe Committee therefore gives the expression \"properly constituted\" its ordinary meaning in the context of the ICSID Convention and in the light of its object and purpose, as a reference to proper compliance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules dealing with the constitution of the tribunal. Such provisions appear to include Section 2 of Chapter IV (Articles 37-40) of the ICSID Convention (entitled \"Constitution of the Tribunal\") as well as Chapter V (Articles 56-58) of the ICSID Convention (entitled \"Replacement and Disqualification of Conciliators and Arbitrators\").\n\n277.\n\nArgentina contends that there has been non-compliance with only one of the provisions relating to the constitution of the Tribunal, namely the first sentence of Article 57.\n\n278.\n\nThe first sentence of Article 57 states that *\"[a] party may propose to a... Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\".* Article 58 then sets out the procedure for a decision on such a proposal for disqualification.\n\n279.\n\nArticle 52 does not state that *\"any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14\"* will constitute a ground of annulment. Rather, the ground of annulment in Article 52(1)(a) is that the tribunal was \"not properly constituted\". The procedure for constituting the tribunal, including the procedure for challenging arbitrators on grounds of a manifest lack of the qualities required Article 14(1), is established by other provisions of the ICSID Convention. If the procedures established by those other provisions of the ICSID Convention have been properly complied with, the Committee considers that the tribunal will be properly constituted for the purposes of Article 52(1)(a).\n\n280.\n\nIt must follow from this that if a party proposes the disqualification of an arbitrator under the first sentence of Article 57 of the ICSID Convention, and if that proposal is rejected in accordance with the procedure established in Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 for deciding such proposals, then it cannot be said that the tribunal was \"not properly constituted\" by reason of non-compliance with the first sentence of Article 57. The Committee considers that Article 52(1)(a) cannot be interpreted as providing the parties with a *de novo* opportunity to challenge members of the tribunal after the tribunal has already given its award. A Committee would only be able to annul an award under Article 52(1)(a) if there had been a failure to comply properly with the procedure for challenging members of the tribunal set out in other provisions of the ICSID Convention.\n\n281.\n\nThis means that if a party never proposed the disqualification of a member of a tribunal under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention (with the consequence that there was never any decision under Article 58), there would be no basis for seeking annulment on the ground that the provisions of Article 57 and 58 were not properly complied with. In the event that the party only became aware of the grounds for disqualification of the arbitrator after the award was rendered, this newly discovered fact may provide a basis for revision of the award under Article 51 of the ICSID Convention but, in the Committee\u2019s view, such a newly discovered fact would not provide a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(a). If no proposal for disqualification is made by a party under Article 57, there will be no decision under Article 58, and in such a case there can (in the Committee\u2019s view) be no basis for contending that the tribunal was not properly constituted by reason of any failure to comply with Article 57 or Article 58.\n\n282.\n\nThe Committee further is of the view that an *ad hoc* committee cannot decide for itself whether or not a decision under Article 58 was correct, as this would be tantamount to an appeal against such a decision. All that an *ad hoc* committee can consider is whether the provisions and procedures prescribed under Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 were complied with. Thus, for instance, a ground of annulment might exist under Article 52(1)(a) if a proposal for disqualification was made under Article 57, but was never decided under Article 58 before the award was given, or if a decision on a proposal for disqualification was purportedly taken by a person or body other than the person or body prescribed by Article 58. In either of these cases, because these provisions of the ICSID Convention relating to the constitution of the Tribunal would not have been properly complied with, the Tribunal would not have been \"properly constituted\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(a).\n\n283.\n\nAzurix argued in its Counter Memorial on annulment that:\n\n*... consistent with the ICSID Convention\u2019s approach to annulment on all other grounds, the Committee\u2019s review should be confined to reviewing the unanimous decision already made by the unchallenged arbitrators for manifest error. Argentina has presented no reason why the Committee\u2019s task for deciding this issue should differ from the type of analysis used for the other grounds for annulment. Such narrow review of the arbitrators\u2019 decision is consistent with the way the ICSID Convention demands that all annulment challenges be approached, which does not authorize a de novo appeal of the arbitrators\u2019 decision.*\n\n284.\n\nThe Committee understands this argument to raise the possibility that a decision under Article 58 on a proposal for disqualification might itself be annulled on any of the grounds of annulment in Article 52(1). The Committee notes that this possibility seems at odds with the literal wording of Article 52, which provides only for annulment of the *award.* However, the Committee does consider that it is self-evident that a decision under Article 58 must, for instance, be taken by the correctly constituted body, and that such decision must not manifestly exceed the powers of the body taking the decision. If these requirements are not met, the proposal for disqualification will not have been properly decided under Article 58. There will thus have been a material non-compliance with a fundamental provision relating to the constitution of the tribunal, with the consequence that the tribunal was not \"properly constituted\" within the meaning of Article 52(1)(a).\n\n**(e) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention: applicable principles**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nThe principles applicable to a ground of annulment based on Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention are considered by the Committee in paragraphs 49-52 above.\n\n**(f) Improper constitution of the tribunal as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(a) of the ICSID Convention: the Committee\u2019s views**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nOn November 29, 2004 Argentina filed a proposal under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention for the disqualification of Dr. Rigo Sureda. Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(2), the proposal was transmitted to members of the Tribunal, and Azurix was notified of the proposal. Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3), Dr. Rigo Sureda furnished explanations to the Tribunal. Pursuant to Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(4), the proposal was considered and voted on by the other two members of the Tribunal in the absence of Dr. Rigo Sureda. The Committee finds that the procedure prescribed by Article 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 were complied with in relation to Argentina\u2019s proposal to disqualify Dr. Rigo Sureda.\n\n287.\n\nThere is no suggestion that the body which took the Disqualification Decision, namely the other two members of the Tribunal, Mr. Lalonde and Mr. Martins, was not the proper body prescribed by Article 58.\n\n288.\n\nThe Committee finds that there is no basis for concluding that Mr. Lalonde and Mr. Martins, in making the Disqualification Decision, manifestly exceeded their powers. In particular, the Committee finds that there is no basis for concluding that they failed to apply the correct law in considering and deciding upon the Disqualification Proposal. Mr. Lalonde and Mr. Martins expressly applied Articles 14, 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention, and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9. Argentina argues that Mr. Lalonde and Mr. Martins failed to apply the correct legal test and that they failed to consider certain authorities. However, the Committee finds that Argentina thereby argues that Mr. Lalonde and Mr. Martins failed to apply the law correctly, rather than that they failed to apply the correct law. The Committee finds that it cannot annul an award under Article 52 on the basis that the body which took a decision under Article 58 of the ICSID Convention failed to apply the law correctly (see, by way of analogy, paragraphs 46-48 and 136-137 above).\n\n289.\n\nThe Committee further finds that there is no basis for concluding that Mr. Lalonde and Mr. Martins seriously departed from any fundamental rule of procedure in dealing with the Disqualification Proposal. In particular, the Committee finds that Argentina was given a full opportunity to present its case in respect of the Disqualification Proposal.\n\n290.\n\nThe Committee notes that, unlike Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention (which provides that an award must state the reasons upon which it is based), Article 58 does not state that a decision on a proposal for disqualification of a member of the Tribunal must give reasons. Nevertheless, a duty to state reasons for a decision under Article 58 might be considered implicit. The Committee finds that it need not determine in the present proceedings the extent to which decisions under Rule 58 must be reasoned. This is because the Committee finds that the Disqualification Decision in this case, which consisted of some 18 pages of single spaced text, fully analysed the arguments, documents and authorities of both parties and was a well-reasoned decision.\n\n291.\n\nMoreover, the Committee agrees that Argentina was alerted to the situation by Dr. Santiago Tawil\u2019s letter dated March 30, 2004, and again by Dr. Rigo Sureda\u2019s letter in May 2004, where it had the chance to make further enquiries if it had so wished. However, did not challenge Dr. Rigo Sureda until November 29, 2004. There was thus an eight-month period between Dr. Santiago Tawil\u2019s letter and the submission of Argentina\u2019s Proposal for Disqualification. During that time, the hearing on the merits took place and the parties submitted their post-hearing memorials. Accordingly, the Committee agrees with the Disqualification Decision that Argentina had waived its right to and/or was estopped from raising objections to the President of the Tribunal.\n\n292.\n\nFor these reasons the Committee concludes that the Disqualification Proposal was decided in accordance with the requirements of Articles 57 and 58 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9, and that as a result of the Disqualification Decision, Dr. Rigo Sureda properly remained a member of the Tribunal. The Committee rejects Argentina\u2019s claim that the Tribunal was not properly constituted.\n\n**(g) Serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention: the Committee\u2019s views**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n293.\n\nArgentina has argued that, by virtue of these conflicts of interest, there has also been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure. However, Argentina states that, although the improper constitution of the tribunal and the serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure are listed as separate grounds for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, it must be considered that the former is a specific case of the latter. The Committee finds that Argentina has advanced no argument in respect of its ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(d) that has not already been considered by the Committee above in relation to the ground of annulment based on Article 52(1)(a).\n\n**(h) Conclusion**\n------------------\n\n294.\n\nFor the reasons in this Section G, the Committee rejects Argentina\u2019s grounds of annulment based on the alleged improper constitution of the Tribunal.\n\n**H. Damages**\n--------------\n\n**(a) Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n295.\n\nArgentina seeks annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention on the basis that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers when it determined the applicable standard of compensation. According to Argentina, the Tribunal, having found that there had been no expropriation but that there had been breaches of other obligations under the BIT, considered that it had a full discretion to determine the appropriate standard of compensation in the circumstances. Argentina maintains that the Tribunal had no such discretion, that the applicable standard of compensation was a question of law, and that by exercising a discretion that it did not have and in failing to decide the standard of compensation in accordance with the applicable law, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.179\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 23-25, referring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 419-424.\n\n296.\n\nArgentina also seeks annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention on the basis that the Tribunal failed to state reasons and/or issued contradictory reasons, in that:\n\n(a) on the one hand, the Tribunal ruled that there had not been an expropriation because the measures attributable to Argentina had not completely destroyed the value of Azurix\u2019s investment; on the other hand, the Tribunal, by awarding damages for the full market value of the investment in respect of breaches of other provisions of the BIT, contradicted its previous finding that Argentina was not responsible for the complete destruction of Azurix\u2019s investment;180\n\n(b) the Tribunal failed to provide any analysis whatsoever as to the causal link between the findings of liability in Part VII of the Award, and, the assessment of damages in Part VIII of the Award, and in quantifying the amount of compensation, the Tribunal simply assumed, without stating any reasons, that the breaches of the BIT identified in Part VII of the Award had caused the total destruction of Azurix\u2019s investment;181\n\n(c) the Tribunal failed to state reasons:\n\n(i) in relation to the first head of damages, as to how it calculated or otherwise obtained the figure of USD 60 million as *\"what an independent well-informed third party would have been willing to pay for the Concession in March 2002, in a context where the Province would have honoured its obligations\u2019\u2019,182*\n\n(ii) in relation to the second head of damages, as to why it adopted the figure of USD 105,240,753 as the *\"additional investments to finance* ABA\";183\n\n(iii) as to why it decided to award *both* USD 60 million for the *\"value of the Canon\" and* USD 105,240,753 for the *\"additional investments to finance* ABA\";184\n\n(iv) as to why Azurix was entitled to 100% of what a third party would pay for the Concession in circumstances where Azurix indirectly owned 90% of ABA\u2019s shares.185\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6 36.\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6\u00b6 37-39.\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6 41, referring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 427, 429.\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6 42, referring to Award \u00b6 430.\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6 43, referring to Award \u00b6\u00b6 427-429.\n\nApplication for Annulment \u00b6 44, referring to Award \u00b6 322.\n\n**(b) Arguments of the parties**\n--------------------------------\n\n297.\n\nArgentina argues, *inter alia,* that:\n\n(a) The BIT does not expressly provide for the standard of compensation for breaches of provisions of the BIT other than in the case of expropriation. The tribunal was obliged to refer to customary international law to fill that *lacuna,* and not to determine the standard of damages as a matter of discretion.186\n\n(b) The Tribunal's decision on the appropriate standard of compensation is contained in five paragraphs of Award.187 There is no attempt in this section of the Award to divine principles of law and the standard of compensation for a breach of the fair and equitable standard of treatment or any other obligation in the BIT. The Tribunal's ultimate decision on the appropriate standard of compensation is contained in paragraph 424 of the Award in a single sentence, which is an assertion of an unfettered discretion, and not an adequate statement of the Tribunal's legal reasons for its decision.\n\n(c) The need for supporting reasons is particularly acute as the idea that the same standard of compensation should be applied to a breach of each and every investment protection obligation of the BIT makes expropriation as a cause of action redundant.\n\n(d) The \"fair market value\" standard of compensation applies only to situations of expropriation, and in cases of breaches of other treaty provisions, the standard of compensation is *\"the amount of loss or damage that is adequately connected to the breach\"* or the *\"amount of the loss or damage actually incurred\u2019.188*\n\n(e) The Tribunal did not have the discretion to apply the standard of compensation for an expropriation (fair market value of the investment) to breaches of other obligations in the BIT. By exercising a discretion that it did not have and failing to decide the standard of compensation in accordance with the applicable law, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n(f) If the approach adopted by the Tribunal were to be generalised, there would be no reason for a claimant to seek to establish the higher threshold of a liability for expropriation because the claimant would obtain the same amount of damages for a breach of any obligation of the BIT.\n\n(g) On the one hand, the Tribunal ruled that there had not been an expropriation because the measure attributable to Argentina had not completely destroyed the value of Azurix\u2019s investment. On the other hand, in upholding Argentina\u2019s liability under the other obligations and awarding damages for the full market value of the investment, the Tribunal contradicted its previous findings that Argentina was not responsible for the complete destruction of as Azurix's investment.189\n\n(h) The Tribunal failed to state any reasons with respect to the question of causation. Having found that Argentina had breached certain obligations under the BIT, the Tribunal proceeded in Part VIII of the Award to quantify damages on the basis of the full market value of the Concession Agreement without providing any analysis whatsoever as to the causal link between the findings of liability in Part VII of the Award and the assessment of damages in Part VIII of the Award or the standards of compensation related to the violations that it had established.190 Causation must be positively established by Azurix, and the issue of causation is fundamental in the determination of damages in international law as well as in municipal law.191 While it must follow that the Tribunal was persuaded that Argentina caused *some* damage to Azurix\u2019s investment, the connection between Argentina\u2019s specific acts and the damage to the investment is never explained in the Award.\n\n(i) In its analysis of the calculation of damages in the Award, the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is contradictory. Having defined the standard of \"fair market value\",192 the Tribunal then awarded compensation to Azurix under two separate heads of damages: USD 60 million for the *\"value of the Canon\"* and USD 105,240,753 for the *\"additional investments to finance ABA\".*\n\n(j) As to the first of these heads of damages, the Tribunal stated that the figure of USD 60 million was *\"what an independent and well-informed third party would have been willing to pay for the Concession in March 2002, in a context where the Province would have honoured its obligations\"*,193 but failed to provide any formulae or principles in the Award as to how that figure was calculated or otherwise obtained.194\n\n(k) As to the second of these heads of damages, the Tribunal failed to state any reasons for adopting the figure of USD 105,240,753. The Tribunal\u2019s approach and decision contradicts and is inconsistent with its findings with respect to the first head of damages in so far as the actual amount invested by Azurix to finance ABA would not correspond to the amount recoverable upon a sale to a hypothetical third party (that is, the fair market value).\n\n(l) It was completely contradictory for the Tribunal to award compensation based upon *both* the fair market value of the concession on March 12, 2002 and the additional investments to finance ABA.\n\n(m) The Tribunal further failed to state reasons when it decided to award both heads of damages. If the first head of damages represents the amount that a third party might pay for the Concession in March 2002 based upon the profits that the Concession Agreement would generate over time, then logically that amount must include the second head of damages.\n\nRelying on Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, Article 3l(3)(c); ICSID Convention, Article 42(1); *Saluka Investments BV v.

Customary international law may therefore fill the *lacunae* and provide governing rules of compensation.195\n\n(b) The accepted standard of compensation under customary international law is found in the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,196 and in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case.197 This standard has been applied by many tribunals in investment arbitrations.198\n\n(c) The Tribunal applied this standard, but then adjusted the amount of the compensation to take into account certain responsibilities that it decided Azurix should bear.199\n\n(d) The international law standard of compensation is not expressed in formulaic terms, and tribunals exercise a broad discretion in determining how best to provide full compensation in a given case. Past arbitral tribunals have taken various approaches to determine a measure of damages appropriate to the individual circumstances of each case.200\n\n(e) Like the present Tribunal, several other investment arbitral tribunals have used the fair market value standard for calculating damages for violations of the fair and equitable treatment standard, even though no expropriation was found in those cases.201 This is an exercise by the tribunal of assessing the best way to compensate given the full and specific factual circumstances of the case. Expropriation requires different elements from other BIT standards, but it is not a higher standard, merely a different one. There is no law or rule or BIT provision mandating that only acts of expropriation can give rise to an award of full compensation or fair market value.\n\n(f) Other tribunals have exercised their judgement to apply different methodologies to compensate for non-expropriatory violations for which the BIT provided no explicit standard.202 These varying approaches show that arbitral tribunals possess discretion in determining how damages are best calculated in the full circumstances of the case in the absence of a *lex specialis* in the BIT.\n\n(g) It is essential that tribunals are granted the discretion to exercise their own judgement to determine the best manner in which to compensate for harm. In both common law countries and in civil law countries there is a broad discretion in fixing the amount of damages awarded. International treaties also provide tribunals discretion in calculating damages.203\n\n(h) It Is not necessary to prove the exact damage suffered In order to award damages; determining damages is not an exact science, and a certain amount of independent judgement is required.204\n\n(i) There is nothing contradictory between the Tribunal\u2019s finding that there was no expropriation and the Tribunal\u2019s decision to award the fair market value of the Concession as damages. The Tribunal did not use the fair market value of the Concession simply \"because\" it found the Province had taken it over; the Tribunal found that fair market value was \"appropriate\" because other tribunals had used that method in non-expropriation cases, and \"particularly since\" the Province had taken over the Concession.\n\n(j) Not every reason needs to be stated and even reasoning that is implicit or inferred can amount to a well reasoned award. The Tribunal sufficiently explained the causal link between its findings of liability and its determination of damages.\n\n(k) In fact, the Award does expressly state its causation findings. The Tribunal made several findings that in the aggregate amounted to breaches of the BIT, and specifically when *\"considered together,... reflect a pervasive conduct of the Province in breach of the standard fair and equitable treatment\",205* in particular, the politicisation of the tariff regime,206 damage inflicted on Azurix\u2019s relationships with its customers,207 and the Province's response to Azurix\u2019s notice of termination.208 The Tribunal found that these cumulative actions with respect to the Concession reduced the value of Azurix\u2019s investment.209 In this case, the \"causal link\" that the Tribunal found was not something complicated, in need of elaborate explanation.210\n\n(l) The Tribunal took great care to assess damages only for Argentina's breaches that caused Azurix harm. The Tribunal rejected two of the four heads of damages claimed by Azurix. Regarding the two heads of damages the Tribunal accepted, the Tribunal expressly found that the Province caused the loss.211\n\n(m) As to the value of the Canon, the Tribunal based its Award on what it believed an informed, independent party would have been willing to pay in March 2002 and provided very specific reasons for this.212 The Tribunal accepted Argentina\u2019s argument that the fair market value was not equal to the price Azurix paid for the Concession.213 The Tribunal sufficiently detailed its reasoning.214 The Tribunal was not required to provide an exact formula for arriving at the amount of USD 60 million because it had a considerable discretion and its explanation was more than adequate.215 The Award clearly states that the amount of USD 60 million is the Tribunal\u2019s estimation of the fair market value of the Canon payment as of March 2002, based on all the evidence in the case.216\n\n(n) As to the damages for Azurix\u2019s additional investments, the Tribunal made its own calculation of the amount of additional investments and then decreased that amount to account for what it considered Azurix should bear as part of its business risk. Argentina never disputed that Azurix invested USD 102.4 million in additional capital contributions to ABA. The Tribunal explained precisely how it arrived at the amount of additional investments made by Azurix.217\n\n(o) The Tribunal did not contradict itself or fail to state reasons for awarding *both* the *\"value of the Canon\" and* the *\"additional investments\".* The Tribunal found that, in addition to the Canon payment, *\"Azurix should be compensated, as part of the fair market value of the Concession, for the additional investments to finance ABA\".218* It is perfectly appropriate to include actual investments in addition to the investor's initial acquisition cost when determining fair market value.219 The fair market value of the Concession and the additional investments taken together, accurately represent the full value of what Azurix invested in Argentina, and are also parts of the Tribunal's opinion of the fair market value of the Concession as of the Province\u2019s takeover in March 2002.\n\nReferring to *ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v.

The Tribunal decided that there had been no breach of the expropriation clause in Article IV of the BIT, or of the obligation in Article ll(2)(c) of the BIT that *\"[e]ach Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments\"220*\n\nSee paragraphs 150-151 above.\n\n301.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal found that there had been breaches for which Argentina was responsible of the obligation in Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT that investments must be *\"at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment\u2019,* of the obligation in Article ll(2)(b) of the BIT not to impair the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments *\"by arbitrary or discriminatory measures\",* and of the obligation in Article ll(2)(a) of the BIT that investments *\"shall enjoy full protection and security\u2019*,221 The Committee has already determined in paragraphs 45-48, 138-177 and 179-184 above, that in making these findings the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention and did not fail to state reasons for its decision, within the meaning of Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\nSee paragraphs 174-177 above.\n\n302.\n\nThe issue of damages was then dealt with by the Tribunal in Part VIII of the Award, entitled \"Compensation\". The Tribunal considered that there were three issues to be determined in relation to the question of compensation.222\n\nAward \u00b6 415.\n\n303.\n\nThe first issue was the question of what compensation had been claimed by Azurix. The Tribunal decided that it would not consider an additional head of compensation that had been included only in the Post-Hearing Memorial, namely an amount on account of discrete damages detailed in the NERA report.223 The decision of the Tribunal to exclude this additional head of damage was in Argentina\u2019s favour and has not been challenged by Azurix.\n\nAward \u00b6 416.\n\n304.\n\nThe second issue, described by the Tribunal as *\"the starting point for the calculation of damages\",*224 was the date on which the breach of the BIT had occurred. The Tribunal referred to the difficulties in establishing the relevant date where a breach of the BIT had been caused, as in this case, not by a single act occurring on a particular day, but by a series of acts over time.225 The Tribunal referred to an award of the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, which decided that *\"where the alleged expropriation is carried out by way of a series of interferences in the enjoyment of property,* the date of the expropriation is *\"the day when the interference has ripened into a more or less irreversible deprivation of the property rather than on the beginning date of the events\",226* The Tribunal went on to say that in this case there could be *\"legitimate disagreement\u2019* as to what date was, but that the Tribunal considered there to be no doubt that by March 12, 2002 (the date on which the Province put an end to the Concession alleging abandonment by ABA), the breaches of the BIT had *\"reached a watershed\"227*\n\nAward \u00b6 415.\n\nAward \u00b6 417.\n\nAward \u00b6 417, quoting *Malek* v. *Iran,* award 534-193-3, para. 114 (1992) (citing *Int\u2019l Technical Prods. Corp.* v. *Iran,* Award No. 190-302-3, at 49, 9 Iran-U.S. Cl. Trib. Rep. 206, 240-241 (1985)).\n\nAward \u00b6 418.\n\n305.\n\nThe third issue was the question of the basis upon which damages should be assessed. In relation to this issue, the Tribunal found:\n\n(a) that the only BIT provision establishing the measure of compensation was Article IV(1), which provides for *\"[c]ompensation... equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known\",* in cases of an expropriation that meets the BIT\u2019S requirements that it be done for a public purpose and be non-discriminatory;228\n\n(b) that in the *CMS* Award, the tribunal, when faced with a similar situation, applied \"the standard of fair market value\" to assess damages in a case where there had been breaches of provisions other than the expropriation provision of the same BIT;229\n\n(c) that case law indicates that under NAFTA, which also provides for a measure of compensation only in cases of expropriation, tribunals have in cases of non-expropriatory breaches *\"exercised considerable discretion in fashioning what they believed to be reasonable* *approaches to damages consistent with the requirements of NAFTA\",230*\n\n(d) that case law indicates that under NAFTA it is *\"open to the tribunals to determine it [compensation] in light of the circumstances of the case taking into account the principles of both international law and the provisions of NAFTA\";231*\n\n(e) that in the *MTD* case, where the tribunal found a breach of the fair and equitable treatment obligation of the relevant BIT, the tribunal accepted the claimants\u2019 proposal to apply the standard of compensation formulated in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case;232\n\n(f) that in the present case, the Tribunal was *\"of the view that a compensation based on the fair market value of the Concession would be appropriate, particularly since the Province has taken it overi,233*\n\nAward \u00b6 419.\n\nAward \u00b6 420, referring to *CMS* Award \u00b6 410.\n\nAward \u00b6 421, referring to *Feldman* Award, \u00b6 197.\n\nAward \u00b6 422, referring to *S.D.

At \u00b6 430 it is indicated that Azurix claimed that the initial sum invested by Azurix was USD 449 million of which USD 438,555,551 represented the payment for the Canon. At\u00b6 41 it is indicated that the \"canon payment\" was 438,555,554 Argentine pesos (the Argentine peso being at the time at parity with the United States dollar): Decision on Jurisdiction, footnote 1.\n\n309.\n\nThe Tribunal gave its reasons for this finding in paragraphs 426 to 428 of the Award.240 Considering various factors, the Tribunal concluded that the value of the Canon on March 12, 2002 was USD 60 million.\n\nAward \u00b6 429.\n\n310.\n\nAs to Azurix\u2019s claim for its further investments, the Tribunal found that there were investments additional to the Canon amounting to USD 112,844,446. However, the Tribunal considered that this amount should be reduced by USD 7,603,693 which represented those damages which the Tribunal found to be related to contractual claims241 and that should be borne by Azurix as part of its business risk.242\n\nThat is, losses arising from matters in which the Tribunal found that the Province did not exercise its public authority but acted as any other contractual party: see Award \u00b6\u00b6 150, 155, 160.\n\nAward \u00b6 430.\n\n311.\n\nAs to Azurix\u2019s claim for unpaid bills to ABA for services rendered prior to the take over of the Concession by the Province and which the Province directed customers not to pay to ABA, the Tribunal found that this amount was owed by the Province to ABA and, therefore, should not be part of the compensation awarded to Azurix.243\n\nAward \u00b6 431.\n\n312.\n\nAs to Azurix\u2019s claim for corporate expenditures for negotiations with the Province, termination of the Concession and transfer of the service, the Tribunal found that it had not received sufficient evidence in support of such costs and that, in any case, these costs related to the business risk that Azurix took when it decided to make the investment.244 As to Azurix\u2019s claim for costs of the ICSID proceedings, the Tribunal decided to consider these as part of the award of costs in the proceedings.245\n\nAward \u00b6 432.\n\nAward \u00b6 432.\n\n313.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal rejected a proposal by Azurix that damages be assessed, as an alternative to the fair market value of the investment, on the theory of unjust enrichment.246\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 434-438.\n\n**(d) Failure to apply the correct law as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention: applicable principles**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n314.\n\nThe principles applicable to a ground of annulment based on Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention are considered by the Committee in paragraphs 136-137 above.\n\n**(e) Failure to apply the correct law as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention: the Committee\u2019s views**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n315.\n\nIt Is not In dispute between the parties, nor in the Committee\u2019s view could it seriously be disputed, that the Tribunal had the power in this case to award damages for any loss that the Tribunal found to have been suffered by Azurix as a result of breaches of the BIT for which Argentina was responsible.\n\n316.\n\nIn considering how to assess damages, the Tribunal began by noting that the only BIT provision providing for the measure of compensation was the expropriation clause in Article IV(1).247 The Tribunal then proceeded to consider how damages were assessed for non-expropriatory treaty breaches in the *CMS* Award (which involved the same BIT as the present case), and in certain arbitrations under NAFTA and a BIT between Malaysia and Chile (both of which, analogously to the BIT in the present case, provide an express standard of compensation only in cases of expropriation).248 The Tribunal noted that in the NAFTA cases, it was found that in cases of non-expropriatory breaches of the treaty *\"the tribunals exercised considerable discretion in fashioning what they believed to be reasonable approaches to damages consistent with the requirements of NAFTA\",*249 and that\n\n*... the lack of a measure of compensation in NAFTA for breaches other than a finding of expropriation reflected the intention of the parties to leave it open to the tribunals to determine it in light of the circumstances of the case taking into account the principles of both international law and the provisions of NAFTA.250*\n\nAward \u00b6 419.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 420-423, referring to *Myers* Award \u00b6 197; *Feldman* Award \u00b6 303-319; *MTD* Award \u00b6 238.\n\nAward \u00b6 421, quoting *Feldman* Award \u00b6 127.\n\nAward \u00b6 422, quoting *Myers* Award \u00b6\u00b6 303-319.\n\n317.\n\nThe Committee considers that it is implicit from this discussion that the Tribunal considered that the law that it was to apply in determining the quantum of damages was the BIT itself, and that failing any express provision in the BIT, the matter was governed by general principles of international law. The Committee finds no fault with the Tribunal\u2019s identification of the applicable law for purposes of determining the quantum of damages, which is in fact consistent with Argentina\u2019s position.\n\n318.\n\nThe Committee finds that it is also implicit from the Tribunal\u2019s discussion of these cases that the Tribunal considered that under such general principles of international law, in the absence of any express provision in the BIT dealing with assessment of damages for breach of a particular provision of the BIT, the tribunal will have a discretion to determine what it considers to be a reasonable approach to damages.\n\n319.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were wrong in its conclusion that under general principles of international law it has such a discretion, the Committee considers that this would be a case of *incorrect application* of the applicable law (which is not a ground of annulment), rather than a case of *non-application* of the applicable law.251 Whether the Tribunal applied the applicable law rightly or wrongly, the Tribunal did in the Committee\u2019s view apply the correct applicable law, namely the BIT itself and general principles of international law.\n\nSee paragraphs 47-48 above.\n\n320.\n\nThe Committee therefore cannot accept Argentina\u2019s argument that the Tribunal determined the standard as a matter of discretion rather than applying principles of customary international law. The Tribunal decided to exercise a discretion *pursuant to* customary international law, and not to exercise a discretion *instead of* customary international law.\n\n321.\n\nThe Tribunal proceeded to determine how it would exercise its discretion in this particular case, and concluded that *\"[i]n the present case,*... a *compensation based on the fair market value of the Concession would be appropriate\"* particularly since the Province had taken the investment over.252\n\nAward \u00b6 424.\n\n322.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal did not have the discretion to apply the \"fair market value\" standard of compensation because under the BIT, this is the standard of compensation for expropriation, and the Tribunal expressly found in this case that there had been no expropriation. However, the Committee finds nothing in the BIT that reserves this standard of compensation solely to cases of expropriation. If the Tribunal had, as it found, a discretion in the approach that it adopted to the assessment of damages, there is no reason in logic why it might not, in the exercise of that discretion, in any case where it considered it appropriate to do so, also apply the \"fair market value\" standard to cases of non-expropriatory breaches of the treaty.\n\n323.\n\nArgentina suggests that this conclusion would make *\"expropriation as a cause of action redundant\u2019* as there would be no reason for a claimant to seek to establish the \"higher\" threshold of liability for expropriation. The Committee is not persuaded by this argument. Indeed, the Committee does not accept Argentina\u2019s premise that the BIT provides for the \"fair market value\" standard in cases of breaches of the BIT amounting to expropriation.\n\n324.\n\nArticle IV(1) of the BIT provides that investments shall not be expropriated or nationalised, except where certain conditions are satisfied, one of these being the payment of compensation *\"equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken\"*,253 Thus, where all requirements of Article IV(1) are met, including the payment of the fair market value, there will be *no breach* of the BIT. On the other hand, in cases where an expropriation *does* constitute a breach of the BIT, either because the requisite compensation has not been paid, or because one of the other requirements are not met, the BIT does not state what the applicable standard for the assessment of damages will be.254 It thus appears that the BIT does not provide the standard of compensation for any type of breach of the BIT, in which case, on the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning the determination of the standard of compensation will always be in the tribunal\u2019s discretion.\n\nArticle IV(1) of the BIT relevantly provides: *\"Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization (\u2018expropriation\u2019) except for a public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article ll(2). Compensation shall be equivalent to the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier...\"*\n\nThus, in *ADC,* the tribunal found that in a case of an *unlawful* expropriation contrary to the BIT, the level of compensation is not the level provided for in the expropriation clause of the BIT (which applies to *lawful* expropriations), but the standard under customary international law: *ADC* Award \u00b6\u00b6 479-500, especially \u00b6\u00b6 485 and 495.\n\n325.\n\nIn any event, even if it were the case that the \"fair market value\" standard is applicable to all breaches of the BIT involving expropriation, it would not make the expropriation provision of the BIT redundant for that standard of compensation also to be applied where the tribunal considers it appropriate to cases involving breaches of other provisions of the BIT. Contrary to what Argentina seems to suggest, the Tribunal did not find that the \"fair market value\" standard was the applicable standard for all breaches of all provisions of the BIT.\n\n326.\n\nArgentina argues that, in cases of breaches of the BIT other than the expropriation clause, the standard of compensation is *\"the amount of loss or damage that is adequately connected to the breach\"* or the *\"amount of the loss or damage actually incurred\u2019,* rather than the \"fair market value\" standard. The Committee considers that, by this argument, Argentina requests the Committee to find that the Tribunal incorrectly applied the applicable law (by applying an incorrect standard) rather than find that the Tribunal failed to apply the applicable law (the BIT and general principles of international law). The Committee reiterates that incorrect application of the applicable law is not a ground of annulment.\n\n327.\n\nIn any event, the Committee is not persuaded that the Tribunal failed to adopt an approach of ascertaining the *\"amount of the loss or damage actually incurred\u2019.* The Tribunal referred to the standard of compensation identified in the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* case, namely that which would *\"wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if the act had not been committed.\u2019\u2019255* Furthermore, the Tribunal, in rejecting Azurix\u2019s proposal that damages be assessed on the theory of unjust enrichment, stated that:\n\n*... damages and unjust enrichment are conceptually distinct in terms of the principles of liability and the measure of restitution. In the case of damages, liability rests on an unlawful act, which is not necessarily the case in unjust enrichment.*  *As to compensation on account of an unlawful act, it is based on the loss suffered,* *while, in the case of unjust enrichment, it is based on restitution..,256*\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 409 and 423 (referring to the submissions of Azurix and the *MTD* Award respectively).\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 436 (emphasis added).\n\n328.\n\nIt Is apparent to the Committee that the Tribunal considered in the present case that the \"fair market value of the investment\" would be appropriate in the circumstances of this particular case to achieve the result of compensating Azurix for the actual loss suffered by it.\n\n329.\n\nFor these reasons, whether or not the Tribunal was right or wrong in applying the standard of compensation that it did, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did not fail to apply the applicable law. The Committee therefore finds no annullable error under Article 52(1)(b).\n\n**(f) Failure of the award to state reasons as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention: applicable principles**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nThe principles applicable to a ground of annulment based on Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention are considered by the Committee in paragraph 178 above.\n\n**(g) Failure of the award to state reasons as a ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention: the Committee\u2019s views**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n331.\n\nArgentina argues that the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the appropriate standard of compensation is contained in five paragraphs of text257 which contain no attempt to divine principles of law and the standard of compensation for a breach of the fair and equitable standard of treatment or any other obligation in the BIT. For the reasons given above, the Committee does not accept this argument. The five paragraphs of text referred to by Argentina contain a discussion of other cases dealing with the same issue, and it is apparent that the Tribunal concluded that it had a discretion under the applicable law to determine the approach to damages.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 419-424.\n\n332.\n\nThe Committee does not consider that the Tribunal found the \"fair market value\" standard to be the standard of compensation for all breaches of the BIT. Rather, the Tribunal found that for breaches of BIT obligations other than the expropriation clause, the Tribunal has a discretion in determining the approach to damages, and that it may in its discretion, if it considers it appropriate, apply the \"fair market value\" standard.\n\n333.\n\nAs to the reasons why the Tribunal, in the exercise of the discretion that it found that it had, decided to adopt the \"fair market value\" standard, the Committee notes the following.\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal gave the following history relating to the termination of the Concession Agreement. On July 18, 2001, ABA requested the Province to cure its breaches of the Concession Agreement. On August 29, 2001, the Province replied denying any wrongdoing. On October 5, 2001, ABA terminated the Concession Agreement. On November 1, 2001, the Province issued an Executive Order rejecting the termination of the Concession Agreement and ordering ABA to cease and desist from claiming that it had terminated the Concession Agreement. On February 26, 2002, ABA filed for bankruptcy reorganization proceedings. On March 7, 2002, the Province deemed that ABA had abandoned the service. On March 12, 2002, the Province terminated the Concession Agreement alleging ABA\u2019s fault. On March 15, 2002, ABA delivered the service to the Province.258\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 244-245.\n\n335.\n\nThe Tribunal found that ABA\u2019s request to terminate the Concession in agreement with the Province \"was a *reasonable request in light of the previous behavior of the Province and its agencies\",* and that the Province\u2019s refusal to accept ABA\u2019s notice of termination and insistence on terminating it by itself on account of abandonment of the Concession was a clear case of a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.259\n\nAward \u00b6 374.\n\n336.\n\nThe Tribunal found that certain conduct of the Province prior to ABA\u2019s request to terminate the Concession also amounted to breaches of BIT for which Argentina was responsible.260 The Committee considers it implicit that it was because of this that the Tribunal considered ABA\u2019s request to terminate the concession to be \"a *reasonable request in light of the previous behavior of the Province and its agencies\".*\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 375-377, 393, 408.\n\n337.\n\nThe Committee also considers it implicit from the above that the Tribunal considered that the breaches of the BIT for which Argentina was responsible had caused the termination of the Concession Agreement, and that the loss caused to Azurix by these breaches was therefore the value of the Concession on the date on which the Province terminated the Concession Agreement. This is particularly implicit in the Tribunal\u2019s comment that *\"compensation based on the fair market value of the Concession would be appropriate, particularly since the Province has taken it over261*\n\nAward \u00b6 424.\n\n338.\n\nThus, contrary to what Argentina claims, the Committee finds that the Tribunal did provide adequate reasons as to the causal link between the Tribunal\u2019s findings of liability in Part VII of the Award and its finding that the amount of damages would be the fair market value of the Concession on March 12, 2002.\n\n339.\n\nArgentina claims that there is an inconsistency, on the one hand, between the Tribunal\u2019s finding that there had not been an expropriation, and, on the other hand, the Tribunal\u2019s finding that Azurix was entitled to the fair market value of the Concession, which is the standard of compensation provided for in Article IV(1) of the BIT in cases of expropriation.\n\n340.\n\nThe Committee considers that these two findings cannot be considered to be contradictory for the reasons given in paragraphs 322-323 above. It is clear from the Tribunal\u2019s reasons that the Tribunal considered that the \"fair market value\" standard of compensation was not confined exclusively to cases of expropriation, but that it could be applied also in cases of breaches of other provisions of the BIT. The Tribunal\u2019s decision to apply the \"fair market value\" standard therefore does not contradict its finding that there was no expropriation.\n\n341.\n\nAs to the reasons why the Tribunal found that USD 60 million was the \"fair market value\" of the Concession on March 12, 2002, the Committee notes the following.\n\n342.\n\nAt paragraph 425 of the Award, the Tribunal determined that the methodology it would adopt for determining the \"fair market value\" of the Concession was the \"actual investment\" method. The Tribunal indicated that this was one of two methodologies put forward by Azurix,262 and it appears from the Award that Argentina did not propose any particular alternative methodology.263 The Tribunal appeared to accept Azurix\u2019s submission that the \"actual investment\" method *\"is compelling as the investment is recent and highly ascertainable\u2019\u2019.264*\n\nAward \u00b6 425.\n\nAward \u00b6 413.\n\nAward \u00b6 425.\n\n343.\n\nThe Tribunal said that *\"the actual investment method is*  *a valid one in this instance* *\"265* It is implicit from this that the Tribunal considered that the actual investment method was not the only valid method that might have been used to determine the fair market value, that the Tribunal had a discretion in determining the methodology that it would adopt, and that the Tribunal preferred the actual investment methodology for the reasons given. The Committee does not find any insufficiency in the Tribunal\u2019s reasons for adopting this methodology.\n\nAward \u00b6 425 (emphasis added).\n\n344.\n\nIn then proceeding to determine Azurix\u2019s \"actual investment\", the only amounts that the Tribunal took into consideration were the Canon payment, and Azurix\u2019s additional capital contributions. The Tribunal declined to take into account certain other amounts that had been claimed by Azurix.266 The Tribunal\u2019s decision to exclude these additional amounts was one in Argentina\u2019s favour, and Argentina raises no objection in respect of this decision.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 416, 431-432.\n\n345.\n\nArgentina has argued that the Tribunal failed to state reasons for deciding to include both the Canon payment and Azurix\u2019s additional capital contributions. The Committee considers it clear that the damages awarded under the \"actual investment\" method correspond to the amounts actually invested by the claimant. As the additional contributions were amounts invested in addition to the Canon payment, it is quite logical that both would be taken into account under an \"actual investment\" methodology. The Committee does not find any insufficiency in the Tribunal\u2019s reasons for including both of these amounts.\n\n346.\n\nAs to the Canon payment, the amount actually paid was in excess of USD 438 million.267 However, the Tribunal considered that \"a *significant adjustment is required to arrive at the real value of the Canon paid by the Claimant\u2019*,268 The Tribunal considered that the relevant amount to be taken into account was not what Azurix actually paid, but rather, *\"what an independent and well-informed third party would have been willing to pay for the Concession in March 2002, in a context where the Province would have honored its obligations\"269* Ultimately, the Tribunal concluded that what an independent and well-informed third party would have been willing to pay for the Concession in March 2002 was USD 60 million.\n\nAward \u00b6 41,414, 430.\n\nAward \u00b6 425.\n\nAward \u00b6 427.\n\n347.\n\nArgentina claims that the Tribunal gave no reasons as to how it arrived at this figure of USD 60 million. However, the Committee considers it sufficiently clear from a reading of paragraphs 426 to 429 of the Award that the Tribunal considered that it had itself to *\"try and determine\"* the fair market value in March 2002 on the basis of all of the material before it.\n\n348.\n\nOne factor that the Tribunal took into account was that *\"no well-informed investor, in March 2002, would have paid for the Concession the price (and more particularly, the Canon) paid by Azurix in mid-1999, irrespective of the actions taken by the Province and of the economic situation of Argentina at that time\",270* and that *\"that no more than a fraction of the Canon could realistically have been recuperated under the existing Concession Agreement\u2019*,271 The Tribunal had previously noted in this respect that other bidders for the Concession presented canons *\"with values at least ten times lower than that submitted by the Claimant\u2019272* This suggests that the most that any other bidder would have been prepared to pay for the Concession in mid-1999 would have been in the order of USD 38.52 million.\n\nAward \u00b6 426.\n\nAward \u00b6 429.\n\nAward \u00b6 240.\n\n349.\n\nHowever, against this, the Tribunal took into account that *\"[w]hen the Province accepted Azurix\u2019s bid, it considered it as the fair market value for the Concession and the Province benefited from the alleged aggressive price paid\u2019273* The Tribunal also took into account that the Province, *\"through its actions and inaction, contributed to the loss in value of the Concession\",274* The Tribunal also took into account the possibility of the hypothetical investor expanding the system and improving efficiency between the periodic 5 year tariff reviews and expected tariff increases from time to time due to increases in the inflation rate.275\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 426.\n\nAward \u00b6\u00b6 428.\n\nAward \u00b6 427.\n\n350.\n\nHaving balanced these competing considerations, the Tribunal arrived at a figure of USD 60 million, that is, a figure that was in the order of 56 percent more than what other investors would have been prepared to pay for the Concession in mid-1999, but that was less than one sixth of what Azurix had actually paid.\n\n351.\n\nIt has been said that:\n\n*... it is well settled that the fact that damages cannot be fixed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss has been incurred. In such cases, approximations are inevitable; the settling of damages is not an exact science.276*\n\nAlthough the Tribunal in this case may not have said so expressly, the Committee considers it clear from the Award that the figure of USD 60 million was an approximation that the Tribunal considered to be fair in all the circumstances. The Committee does not find any insufficiency in the Tribunal\u2019s reasons in arriving at this figure.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, August 20, 2007 \u00b6 8.3.16 (footnotes omitted).\n\n352.\n\nArgentina then argues that the Tribunal failed to state reasons as to why Azurix was entitled to 100% of what a third party would pay for the Concession in circumstances where Azurix indirectly owned 90% of ABA\u2019s shares. The Committee notes in this respect that both the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Award contain both statements that the Canon was paid by Azurix,277 and statements that the Canon was paid by ABA.278 However, at paragraph 64 of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal said:\n\n*Azurix made an investment by paying a \"canon\" to obtain the concession to provide water and wastewater services to the Province. To carry out the investment, Azurix organized several subsidiaries, as required by the Bidding Terms, and established a locally registered company in Argentina, ABA.* *The objective of the definition of investment in the BIT is precisely to include this type of structure established for the exclusive purpose of the investment in order to protect the real party in interest.*\n\nThe Tribunal also referred in paragraph 59 of the Decision on Jurisdiction to Azurix\u2019s claim that its \"investment\" consisted of \"Azurix\u2019s payment of its US$438.6 million canon (which constitutes invested capital), its ownership interest and investment in ABA, and the rights in the Concession Agreement\".\n\nFor example, Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 64; Award \u00b6 426.\n\nFor example, Decision on Jurisdiction \u00b6 22; Award \u00b6 41.\n\n353.\n\nThe Committee considers that it is sufficiently clear that the Tribunal considered that the whole of the Canon payment was an investment of Azurix, and that ABA was merely a vehicle for carrying out the investment. The Committee does not find any insufficiency in the Tribunal\u2019s reasons in taking into account the full value of the Concession.\n\n354.\n\nArgentina further claims that the Tribunal gave no reasons as to why it adopted the figure of USD 105,240,753 as the *\"additional investments to finance ABA\".*\n\n355.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s reasons in this respect are set out in paragraph 430 of the Award, which must be read in conjunction with paragraph 411 of the Award, setting out the damages claimed by Azurix under the \"actual investment\" method.\n\n356.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that Azurix claimed to have invested USD 449 million when it acquired the Concession, an amount that included the Canon payment. This meant that, at the time that it acquired the Concession, in addition to the Canon payment of USD 438,555,554, Azurix had also invested an additional amount of USD 10,444,446 (the difference between the total amount of USD 449 million originally invested and the Canon payment).\n\n357.\n\nThe Committee further noted that Azurix also claimed to have made additional capital contributions to ABA of USD 102.4 million. This meant that Azurix\u2019s actual investment, in addition to the Canon payment, was USD 112,844,446 (the sum of USD 10,444,446 and USD 102.4 million). From paragraph 413 of the Award, it appears that Argentina did not dispute that these figures accurately reflected the actual amounts invested by Azurix in addition to the Canon. In any event, it is clear from paragraph 430 of the Award that the Tribunal accepted Azurix\u2019s claim that they did.\n\n358.\n\nThe Tribunal then went on at paragraph 430 of the Award to find that the amount of USD 112,844,446 should be reduced by USD 7,603,693, which the Tribunal said represented:\n\n*the aggregate of the claims presented by Azurix on account of damages which the Tribunal has found to be related to contractual claims-those related to the works listed in Circular 31(A) except for Bahia Blanca-and that should be borne by Azurix as part of its business risk279*\n\nThis is a reference back to the Tribunal\u2019s findings in paragraphs 150, 155 and 160 of the Award. The footnote to paragraph 430 of the Award indicates that this figure of USD 7,603,693 was taken from a report by NERA, an expert consultancy company,280 that was annexed to Azurix\u2019s memorial. Argentina has not disputed this particular figure. If this sum of USD 7,603,693 is deducted from USD 112,844,446, that leaves the amount of USD 105,240,753 as the amount of Azurix\u2019s additional investments beyond the Canon payment.\n\nAward \u00b6 430.\n\nAward \u00b6 213.\n\n359.\n\nHowever, Argentina argues that the Tribunal\u2019s adoption of this figure of USD 105,240,753:\n\n*... contradicts and is inconsistent with its findings with respect to the first head of damages in so far as the actual amount invested by Azurix to finance ABA would not correspond to the amount recoverable upon a sale to a hypothetical third party* (i.e. *the fair market value),281*\n\nArgentina Memorial on Annulment \u00b6 227.\n\n360.\n\nIn this respect, the Committee notes that it has already found, at paragraph 305-306 above, that the Tribunal implicitly found that it had a discretion to determine what it considers to be the appropriate approach to damages in the circumstances of the particular case. The Tribunal decided to assess damages on the basis of the \"fair market value\" standard, and it further decided that it would determine the \"fair market value\" in accordance with the \"actual investment\" method. Although the Tribunal did not spell out in detail what the \"actual investment\" method involved, the Committee considers it plain from the reasoning in the Award that under this method, the amount of damages would correspond to the amounts actually invested by Azurix prior to March 2002.282 It logically follows from this that the sum of USD 105,240,753, being part of the amount actually invested by Azurix, was to be taken fully into account in the assessment of damages.\n\nIn this respect, it is also noted that in the *Vivendi* Award \u00b6 8.3.12, the tribunal referred to *\"generally accepted alternative means of calculating fair market value, such as \u2018book value\u2019 - the net value of an enterprise\u2019s assets, \u2018investment value\u2019 - the amount actually invested prior to the injurious acts, \u2018replacement value\u2019 - the amount necessary to replace the investment prior to the injurious acts, or \u2018liquidation value\u2019 - the amount a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for the investment in a liquidation process\".*\n\n361.\n\nIt would in principle therefore also follow from the Tribunal\u2019s adoption of the \"actual investment\" method that the full amount of the Canon payment, USD 438,555,554, should also have been included in the damages awarded. While the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is not expressed in detail, the Committee finds that it is implicit from the reasoning as a whole that the Tribunal in fact decided to apply a modified form of the \"actual investment\" method. Under the method that the Tribunal employed, in determining the fair market value, the Tribunal took the actual amounts invested by Azurix as its starting point, but then reduced the relevant amounts when it considered that there were reasons justifying this. Thus, while the actual amount of the Canon payment was USD 438,555,554, the Tribunal only took USD 60 million of this into account in assessing damages, for the reasons given above. Similarly, while the actual amount of the additional capital contributions was USD 112,844,446, the Tribunal only took USD 105,240,753 of this into account in assessing damages, for the reasons given above.\n\n362.\n\nThe Committee recalls that it is not a court of appeal, and that it is not the function of the Committee to pass judgment upon the substance of the Tribunal\u2019s decision with respect to the quantum of damages. In this ground of annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the issue for the Committee to determine is whether the award has failed to state the reasons on which its decision as to the quantum of damages was based. The Committee is satisfied that the Award *\"enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B and eventually to its conclusion\",*283 and that *\"an informed reader of the Award would understand the reasons given by the Tribunal and would discern no material contradiction in them\",284*\n\n*MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6 5.09.\n\n*MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 92.\n\n363.\n\nThe Committee considers it clear from the reasoning in the Award that the assessment of damages proceeded by the following steps:\n\n(1) Compensation was to be based on the fair market value of the investment on March 12, 2009.\n\n(2) The fair market value on 12 March 2009 was to be assessed by the actual investment method.\n\n(3) The actual investments made by Azurix to March 12, 2009 were:\n\n(a) the Canon payment was USD 438,555,554; and\n\n(b) the additional capital contributions of USD 112,844,446.\n\n(4) However, of these amounts actually invested by Azurix, the Tribunal would only take into account in the assessment of damages:\n\n(a) USD 60 million of the Canon payment, this being the amount that an independent and well-informed third party would have been willing to pay for the Concession in March 2002, in a context where the Province would have honored its obligations; and\n\n(b) USD 105,240,753 of the additional capital contributions, the remainder being an amount that Azurix should bear as part of its business risk.\n\n364.\n\nThe Committee sees no inconsistency or contradiction in steps (1) to (3) in this reasoning. The Committee accepts that step (4) at first blush may appear difficult to reconcile with steps (2) and (3). However, the Committee finds that steps (2) and (3) on the one hand, and step (4) on the other, are not *\"genuinely contradictory\u2019* reasons that *\"cancel each other out\u2019,* such that the Award is *\"essentially lacking in any expressed rationale\"*,285 For the reasons given above, the Committee considers that it is clear from the reasoning of the Award as a whole that steps (1) to (4) together constitute a modified form of the \"actual investment\" method that the Tribunal was applying.\n\n*MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 50, quoting *Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 64-65.\n\n365.\n\nFurthermore, even if step (4) was in genuine contradiction with the previous steps, in the Committee\u2019s view this contradiction would not justify annulment of the entire portion of the Award dealing with quantum of damages. The Committee considers it clear that steps (1) to (3) were the fundamental basis of the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of damages. If the last step in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning contradicted this fundamental basis, it was a contradiction that was very much in Argentina\u2019s favour. The Committee has *\"a certain measure of discretion as to whether to annul an award, even if an annullable error is found\u2019*,286 Even if step (4) was contradictory, and for the reasons given the Committee does not think that it was, the Committee would in the circumstances of this case not be minded to annul the decision on quantum of damages on the basis of a contradiction that was to the advantage of the party requesting annulment.\n\n*Vivendi* Annulment Decision \u00b6 66; *MINE* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 4.09 and 4.10; *Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 24-27.\n\n366.\n\nThe Committee therefore rejects Argentina\u2019s request for annulment under Article 52(1)(e).\n\n**I. Costs**\n------------\n\n367.\n\nFor the reasons given above, the Committee has rejected Argentina\u2019s application for annulment in its entirety. It follows that the Tribunal\u2019s ruling on the costs of the proceedings before the Tribunal stands.\n\n368.\n\nAs to the costs of the present annulment proceedings, under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j), read in conjunction with Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 53, the Committee has a discretion to determine how and by whom shall be paid the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.\n\n369.\n\nThe Committee notes that in the *MTD* Annulment Decision, it was said that:\n\n*In all but one of the concluded annulment proceedings, Committees have made no order for the parties\u2019 own costs and have held that ICSID\u2019s costs should be borne equally by the parties. They did so not only where the application for annulment succeeded in whole or part but also where it failed.287*\n\nIn that case, the *ad hoc* committee went on to say that:\n\n*This result might be thought anomalous. However, in the interest of consistency of ICSID jurisprudence and in the circumstances of the present case, the Committee proposes to follow the existing practice.*\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in the *Soufraki* Annulment Decision,288 in adopting the same approach to costs, also referred to a *\"developing practice\"* in this respect, a practice which was followed in more recent cases such as the *CMS* Annulment Decision289 and the *Lucchetti* Annulment Decision.290\n\n*MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 110.\n\n*Soufraki* Annulment Decision \u00b6 138.\n\n*CMS* Annulment Decision \u00b6\u00b6 161-162.\n\n*Lucchetti* Annulment Decision \u00b6 131.\n\n370.\n\nHowever, in the *MTD* Annulment Decision, the *ad hoc* committee added that:\n\n*... this practice is not without flexibility and admits of exception. In this regard, it observes that in* CDC Group PLC v Republic of the Seychelles, *the committee ordered* *the unsuccessful respondent to pay both the claimant\u2019s and ICSID\u2019s costs of the annulment proceedings. The committee noted that the annulment application was \"fundamentally lacking in merit\" and that the respondent\u2019s case was \"to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed.\"291*\n\nParticular circumstances were also considered to justify a different order as to costs in the *Repsol* Annulment Decision292 and the *Malaysian Historical Salvors* Annulment Decision.293\n\n*MTD* Annulment Decision \u00b6 111.\n\n*Repsol* Annulment Decision \u00b6 88.\n\n*Malaysian Historical Salvors* Annulment Decision \u00b6 82.\n\n371.\n\nAs regards the expenses incurred by the Centre in connection with this proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee, the Committee is of the view that what has been referred to as \"existing practice\" fails to accord proper deference to Regulation I4(3)(e) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations, which provides that in annulment proceedings:\n\n*... the applicant shall be solely responsible for making the advance payments requested by the Secretary-General to cover expenses following the constitution of the Committee, and without prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with Article 52(4) of the Convention to decide how and by whom expenses incurred in connection with the annulment proceeding shall be paid.*\n\n372.\n\nIn this regard, in respect of ICSID\u2019s expenses there is a different regime as to costs advances between annulment proceedings and the original proceedings before the tribunal, where, pursuant to Regulation 14(3)(d) of the Administrative and Financial Regulations:\n\n*... unless a different division is provided for in the Arbitration Rules or is decided by the parties or the Tribunal, each party shall pay one half of each advance or supplemental charge, without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of an arbitration proceeding to be made by the Tribunal pursuant to Article 61(2) of the Convention.*\n\n373.\n\nAs to this difference in approach the Committee takes the view that a default position is thereby established that in the absence of other order, a party who has applied for annulment and has paid in advance all of the costs of the Centre in relation to that application as is required by the Regulations should bear those costs.\n\n374.\n\nOn this issue of ICSID\u2019s costs, the Committee acknowledges that the annulment procedure is a feature of the ICSID system that is important for maintaining the confidence of parties in that system.294 Thus, the Committee has observed that a requirement for an applicant for annulment to provide security for a continuation of a stay of enforcement of the award pending annulment proceedings, other than in an exceptional case, could compromise this confidence-balancing function.295 On the other hand, the Committee considers that after an application for annulment by one party has proved to be entirely unsuccessful, it would risk compromising confidence in the ICSID system, and in the finality of ICSID awards, if the other party is required as of course to reimburse the unsuccessful applicant a share of the ICSID costs associated with the unsuccessful application.\n\n*Azurix* Stay of Proceedings Decision \u00b6 30.\n\n*Azurix* Stay of Proceedings Decision \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\n375.\n\nWhilst the Committee is mindful of the high importance of maintaining consistency in the ICSID jurisprudence, the Committee does not consider that an approach that it sees as wrong in principle should continue to be followed, merely for the sake of consistency with precedent. The Committee agrees with the *MTD* Annulment Decision that the existing practice is \"anomalous\" to the extent that it normally requires the ICSID costs to be borne equally by the parties even in a case where the application for annulment was wholly unsuccessful. In the Committee\u2019s opinion, that anomalous position arises from having insufficient regard to the provisions of Regulation I4(3)(e) compared with Regulation I4(3)(d) that applies to proceedings before a tribunal.\n\n376.\n\nAs regards the existing practice, the Committee notes that there have only been six cases in which a final decision of the *ad hoc* committee rejected in whole the application for annulment.296 In two of these cases, the *ad hoc* committee ordered the costs of the Centre and of the *ad hoc* committee to be paid wholly by the unsuccessful applicant for annulment.297 That leaves only four cases in which a wholly unsuccessful applicant for annulment was held to be entitled to recover part of the ICSID costs from the other party.\n\n*Wena Hotels* Annulment Decision; *MTD* Annulment Decision; *Repsol* Annulment Decision; *Soufraki* Annulment Decision; CDC Annulment; Decision *Lucchetti* Annulment Decision.\n\n*Repsol* Annulment Decision \u00b6 88; CDC Annulment Decision \u00b6 90.\n\n377.\n\nIn all the circumstances, the Committee does not consider that it would amount to too fundamental a departure from precedent for it for apparent and good reasons of principle derived from the Regulations themselves for it to decline to follow the approach adopted in those four cases.\n\n378.\n\nThe Committee considers that under the Regulations, and as a matter of discretion, the normal course should be for a wholly unsuccessful applicant for annulment carry the burden of the whole of the costs of the Centre advanced by it associated with the proceedings, including the fees and expenses of the members of the *ad hoc* committee. Of course, the Committee does not exclude the possibility that circumstances might justify a departure from this normal rule, but the Committee finds no such exceptional circumstances in the present case. In particular, the fact that there are novel and complex issues to be determined in the annulment proceedings, as here, does not of itself amount to such exceptional circumstances. Also, as here, it is of the essence of annulment matters that they are original and difficult.\n\n379.\n\nThe Committee determines that Azurix shall not be ordered to refund Argentina a proportion of the expenses of the Centre in connection with this proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee.\n\n380.\n\nAs to each party\u2019s own litigation costs, the Committee notes that in only two previous cases was the wholly unsuccessful applicant for annulment ordered to pay all or half of the other party\u2019s costs.298 In the other four cases referred to above, there was either no order for such costs, or each party was ordered to bear Its own costs. The Committee notes that each party to the present proceedings has borne its own litigation costs throughout the course of the proceedings. The Committee does not consider that there are circumstances in the present case that would justify an order for Argentina to reimburse Azurix for some or all of the latter\u2019s litigation costs.\n\n*Repsol* Annulment Decision \u00b6 88; *CDC* Annulment Decision \u00b6 90.\n\n**Decision**\n------------\n\n**For the reasons given above, the Committee decides:**\n\n**(1) The application for annulment of the Argentine Republic is dismissed in its entirety.**\n\n**(2) Argentina shall bear all expenses incurred by the Centre in connection with this proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee.**\n\n**(3) Each party shall bear its own litigation costs and expenses incurred with respect to this annulment proceeding, including its costs of legal representation.**\n\n**(4) Pursuant to Article 52(5) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 54(3), the stay of enforcement of the Award ordered by the Committee in its decision of December 28, 2007 is terminated.**"}]}
