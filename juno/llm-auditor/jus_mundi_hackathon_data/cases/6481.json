(emphasis added). As a logical consequence of such reasoning, if taxes are not sanctions or penalties, sanctions or penalties cannot be considered taxes.\n\n7.\n\nThe challenged measures did not impose taxes. The Peruvian Tax Code establishes only three types of levies (*tributos*): taxes (*impuestos*), contributions and fees (*tasas*). Penalties and interest are not included among them.4\n\nHernandez II (**CER-8)**, \u00b6\u00b6 129-144, citing Rule II of the Tax Code (**CA-14).**\n\n8.\n\nThe challenged measures did not enforce taxes. They failed to waive penalties and interest and, as such, although they constitute acts of Respondent, they were not taxation measures themselves.5\n\nAs explained by one of the tax experts (Hernandez II (**CER-8)**, \u00b6 137), even if some penalties could be applied as a consequence of non-payment of taxes, they are, in themselves, independent and separate obligations.\n\n9.\n\nWhile most States view their power to impose taxes in their territory as a central element of their sovereignty, its exercise is subject to very strict limits.6 Consistent with such idea, when treaties provide for tax exclusions from investment protection, their purpose is to preserve the States' sovereign power to impose taxes in their territory7 and they should not be extended to other governmental decisions or measures at risk of affecting protected rights and diverting from the very same purpose that inspired the tax carve-out clauses.\n\nConstitutional Court of Per\u00fa, Case No. 3303-2003-AA/TC, decision dated 28 June 2004, p. 1 **(CA-378)** (\"*\u2026est\u00e1n sometidos a la observancia de los principios constitucionales consagrados por el art\u00edculo 74\u00b0 de la Constituci\u00f3n, que regulan el r\u00e9gimen tributario, como son el de legalidad, de igualdad, de no confiscatoriedad, de capacidad contributiva y los derechos fundamentales.

On the contrary, my co-arbitrators affirm that such regulations limit the scope of stabilization agreements to a specific investment project,11 understanding by such \u2013in the case of Cerro Verde\u2013 only the original investment in the leaching facility.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 698-699, also referred to as a \"specific mining project set out in the investment program of the feasibility study\u201d (Award, \u00b6 699) or as a \"specific investment in a specific mining project\u201d (Award, \u00b6 703).\n\n14.\n\nHowever, the Mining Law and the Mining Regulations provisions defining the stability guarantees' scope referred to the mining units or concessions, not to specific investment projects. In fact, the term \"investment projects\u201d did not exist in the Mining Law or the Mining Regulations until the July 2014 amendments to the Mining Law.\n\n15.\n\nArticle 82 of the Mining Law granted stability guarantees to \"mining activity titleholders\u201d to promote investment within an \"Economic-Administrative Unit\u201d, defined as a \"set of mining concessions located within the limits set forth in Article 44 of this Law, the processing plants, and the other assets that constitute a single production unit due to sharing supply, administration and services\u201d.12\n\nMining Law **(CA-1**), Article 82. Article 44 of the Mining Law established that \"*[t]o fulfill the work obligations established in the preceding chapter, the titleholder of more than one mining concession of the same class and nature, may group them into Economic Administrative Units, provided they are located within an area of a 5 kilometer radius, in the case of non-ferrous metallic minerals or primary gold metallic minerals; a 20 kilometer radius in the case of iron, coal and non-metallic mineral\u2026*\u201d.\n\n16.\n\nIn interpreting Article 82 of the Mining Law and Article 22 of the Mining Regulations, the majority provides particular value to the term \"*exclusively*\u201d of Article 22 of the Mining Regulations in the understanding that such term limits the scope of stabilization agreements to a specific investment project and that the reference to concessions or Economic Administrative Units (or **EUAs**) in such provision only shows the location where the investments are made.13\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 702-703.\n\n17.\n\nI fail to find in those provisions the clarity that the majority affirms. On the contrary, when reading Article 22 of the Mining Regulations, the term \"*exclusively*\u201d appears to be referring to \"*the investments that it makes **in the concessions or Economic-Administrative Units***\u201d (emphasis added).14\n\nLikewise, Article 2 of the Mining Regulations **(CA-432)** makes reference to concessions or Economic Administrative Units and not to \"specific investment projects\u201d establishing that when \"*the titleholder*\u201d has \"*several concessions or Economic-Administrative Units*\u201d stability qualification \"*will only take effect for those **concessions** or **units** that are supported by\u2026 the [Stability] agreement*\u201d (emphasis added)*.* When implementing Article 83 of the Mining Law **(CA-1)**, Article 22 of the Mining Regulations **(CA-432)** established that in order to reflect the result of their operation, titleholders that have \"*other **concessions or Economic-Administrative Units***\u201d different from those already established, had to \"*keep independent accounts and reflect them in separate earning statements*\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n18.\n\nAs the activities and investments of the mining companies are carried out through the concession system,15 the wording of Article 22 of the Mining Regulations seems consistent with the intention of preventing an investor from obtaining stability for non-mining activities and to exclude affiliates of the investor other than the mining company that made the investment,16 a concern existing at the time of drafting the statute and that appears to have originated in the privatization of the State-owned conglomerate Centrom\u00edn.17\n\nArticle 7 of the Mining Law **(CA-1)** provides that \"*[t]he exploration, exploitation, beneficiation, general work and mining transport activities are carried out by national or foreign natural and legal persons through the concession system*\u201d.\n\nIn line with such reasoning, Article 83 of the Mining Law **(CA-1)** provides that \"*[t]he effect of the contractual benefit shall apply exclusively to the activities of the mining company in whose favor the investment is made*\u201d*.*\n\n*See* Tr. 842:8-16; 843:8-844:14; 919:10-922:10 (Day 3) (Chappuis). Ms. Chappuis explained that Mr. Polo came from Centrom\u00edn \u2013a State-owned mining company with seven old underground mines, a lot of labor problems and without a tax stability agreement\u2013 and that their concern when drafting this provision of the Mining Law together with Mr. Polo was that Centrom\u00edn not only had mines but also had factories.\n\n19.\n\nThe majority also finds that the only way to give effect to the term \"*exclusively*\u201d in Article 83 is to interpret the provision as meaning that not all activities of a mining company are subject to stability guarantees, rather only those in relation to the undertaken investment project set out in the feasibility study.18 Concerning the fact that Article 83 of the Mining Law was amended in 2014 and that Article 83-B was therein introduced, the majority concludes that the amendment to Article 83 only clarified what legal framework was in force before the amendment.19\n\nAward, \u00b6 699.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 707-708.\n\n20.\n\nI cannot agree. The 2014 introduction of Article 83-B to the Mining Law meant a significant change in the existing regulatory scheme by relating the stability benefit to the investment plan contained in the feasibility study, forcing titleholders of concessions or EAUs to undergo a whole new procedure to stabilize expansions, and therefore restricting its applicability to future investments.20\n\nMining Law **(CA-1)**, Article 83-B, third paragraph (\"*The effect of the contractual benefit shall apply exclusively to the activities of the mining company in whose favor the investment is made, **provided that said investments are expressly mentioned in the Investment Program contained in the Feasibility Study that is part of the Stability Agreement**; or, the additional activities that are performed after the execution of the investment program, provided that such activities are performed within the same concession where the Investment Project that is the subject matter of the agreement entered into it with the State is being developed; they are related to the purpose of the Investment Project; that the amount of the additional investment is no less that the equivalent in domestic currency to U$S 25,000,000; and they are previously approved by the Ministry of Energy and Mines, without prejudice to subsequent auditing from the aforementioned Sector*\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n21.\n\nAmendments to an existing legal regime are not made to clarify what is already clear. Much less amendments of the relevance of the one introduced through Article 83-B of the Mining Law by linking the stability benefit to the investment plan contained in the feasibility study, precisely the main area of disagreement between SMCV and the Peruvian authorities at the time.21\n\nAt the hearing, Prof. Otto confirmed that such was not the common understanding of the authorities and other participants in the industry of how the stability guarantees worked. Referring to his 2002 meetings with the Peruvian authorities -who he was advising at the time \u2013 he expressed: \"*During my many meetings to prepare my comprehensive review of the Peruvian mining fiscal system for the MEF, a limitation of stabilization to only the initial Feasibility Study never came up. It was a nonissue. No one was thinking that way. It would have been a unique position, worldwide, harming Per\u00fa's ability to compete for investment*\u201d Tr. 2110:19-2111:3 (Day 7) (Otto).\n\n22.\n\nUnder Article 86 of the Mining Law, stability agreements are adhesion contracts (*contratos de adhesi\u00f3n*) prepared by the Ministry of Energy and Mines and need to incorporate all the guarantees established in the Mining Law. Stability agreements cannot be interpreted against the Mining Law and the Mining Regulations nor be negotiated with a different scope than the one established by the Mining Law or the Mining Regulations.22 All stability agreements were drafted in the same way, with few blanks to be filled in order to avoid the possibility of corruption.23 The investor was not free to choose whether to apply for an administrative unit, a whole specific concession or a specific investment. The stability agreements applied to all the concessions indicated in Annex I of the Model Stability Agreement24 and there was no room for negotiation of a different scope.25\n\nTr. 2333:13-22; 2356:6-11 (Day 8) (Bullard); Bullard Presentation (**CD-8**), slide 9.\n\nTr. 914:13-15; 931:19-21; 936:14-22 (Day 3) (Chappuis).\n\nTr. 933:10-934:7 (Day 3) (Chappuis).\n\nBullard II (**CER-7**), \u00b6\u00b6 12-16.\n\n23.\n\nStability agreements must be constructed in accordance with the Mining Law and the Mining Regulations.26 Therefore, as the Mining Law and the Mining Regulations provided that stability covered concessions and EAUs, not \"specific investment projects\u201d, stability agreements must be considered as providing the same scope of guarantees that the Mining Law and the Mining Regulations, that is in connection to the concessions part of the stabilized mining unit.27\n\nTr. 2333:10-22 (Day 8) (Bullard); Bullard Presentation (**CD-8**), slide 9.\n\nTr. 2255:4-10 (Day 8) (Vega).\n\n24.\n\nSCMV's investments were made in its Mining Concessions Cerro Verde No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 and its Beneficiation Concession Plant Cerro Verde, located in the district of Uchumayo, Department of Arequipa, over an extension of 7,455 has and 463 has, respectively.28 Those Mining (Cerro Verde No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3) and Beneficiary Concessions were the ones covered by the Stability Agreements, irrespective of the different techniques or processes (*i.e.* leaching or flotation) used in developing their mineral reserves.29 The introduction of the term \"*The Leaching Project of Cerro Verde*\u201d used in the Stability Agreement,30 which has probably contributed to trigger this dispute, appears to have followed the language used in Clause 1.1. of the Model Contract, which required the parties to define a name for the EAU.31\n\nStability Agreement **(CE-12)**, Clause 3 and Exhibit 1.\n\nWhile the upper layers of minerals (oxide and secondary sulfides) are stripped and processed through a leaching facility, primary sulfides (also known as copper ore) need to be processed through a concentrator. At the end, the same minerals, in the same concessions (Cerro Verde No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3), are extracted and processed in a single production unit (EAU) through two different techniques (leaching and flotation).

Such possibility was already contemplated as part of the project at the time of the privatization and included in its documents.32 And so relevant was Per\u00fa's interest in the development of Cerro Verde's primary sulfide reserves that Minero Per\u00fa initiated an arbitration against Cyprus in 2001 for allegedly breaching the 1994 Share Purchase Agreement. The dispute was finally settled with SMCV's compromise to invest an additional U$D 50 million in the project and to explore additional ways of developing a concentrator.33\n\n1994 SMCV's Share Purchase Agreement **(CE-4)**, Annex G. The three initial phases referred to the leaching operation. The fourth and last one to the construction of a 28,000 tons per day expandable primary sulfide concentrator.\n\n2001 Out-of-Court Settlement Agreement Between Cyprus Climax Metals Co. and Empresa Minera del Per\u00fa S.A. **(CE-17)**, Clause 3.1(B) (\"*CYPRUS undertakes to continue carrying out, within the aforementioned period, the research and technological development tasks intended to continue evaluating economically reasonable ways for the exploitation and processing of primary sulfides at Cerro Verde*\u201d).\n\n26.\n\nAs already explained, Clauses 1.1. and 3 of the 1998 Stability Agreement identified as the subject of SMCV's stability guarantees the Mining Concession (Cerro Verde No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3) and the Beneficiation Concession (Cerro Verde Beneficiation Plant), which together comprise an EAU under Article 82 of the Mining Law.34 A different interpretation would assume that SMCV claimed less than the scope established by the Mining Law, the Regulations, and the Model Contract, voluntarily reducing its rights. The title used in the 1998 Stability Agreement \u2013 the \"*Leaching Project of Cerro Verde*\u201d \u2013 was referential and could not have defined its scope.35 A similar situation seem to have occurred in the case of SMCV's 1994 Stability Agreement36 and those executed by other mining companies.37\n\nTr. 2334:1-10; 2356:6-17 (Day 8) (Bullard).\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 26 (b) and 28, referring to the testimonies at the hearing of Mr. Polo, Ms. Chappuis and Ms. Torreblanca.\n\n*See* 1994 Stability Agreement (**CE-344)**, Clauses 1.1 and 5.1. While the referential name used was \"Cerro Verde Project\u201d, it clearly did not match with the scope of the stability agreement as the project was limited to a minor improvement of the existing facility, valued in U$S 2.2 million.\n\n*See List of Guarantee Contracts and Investment Promotion Measures, Report No. 153-2005-MEM/OGAJ* (**RE-175**), April 14, 2005. When referring to projects No. 2 of Minera Toromocho S.A. and No. 3 of Minera Yauricocha S.A. the referential names used in both cases in the list for the project is \"Centrom\u00edn Per\u00fa\u201d; project No. 10 of Minsur S.A. is denominated \"Minsur\u201d; project No. 14 of Minera Ares S.A. is called \"Ares\u201d; project No. 16 of Minera Sipan S.A. is denominated \"Sip\u00e1n\u201d, etc. None of those names appear to explain or define the scope of the individual stability agreement executed in each case. *See also* Bullard Presentation (**CD-8**), slides 42-43.\n\n27.\n\nThe 1996 Feasibility Study's investment program was a qualifying prerequisite to demonstrate SMCV's compliance with the minimum U$S 50 million investment requirement for 15-year stability agreements under the Mining Law.38 Neither the Mining Law, the Mining Regulations in force in 1998 nor the 1998 Stability Agreement established that the feasibility study would define the scope of the guarantees provided by them.39\n\nTr. 2343:21-22; 2349:10-14 (Day 8) (Bullard).\n\nRespondent's witnesses were not in agreement on how such a system would have worked. While Ms. Bedoya (Supervisor at SUNAT's National Intendency of Challenges) was of the view that every new investment exceeding the items and amounts mentioned in the investment program should be considered non stabilized (even if they related to the leaching project subject of the feasibility study), Mr. Polo (Vice-minister of the MINEM and one of the drafters of the Mining Law) was not able to reach such conclusive determination (Tr. 1643:8-1644:15, 1648:2-7, 1652:6-21, (Day 6) (Bedoya); Tr. 1349:2-5, 1377:4-1378:9 (Day 5) (Polo)).\n\n28.\n\nThe majority is also of the view that, as the Concentrator did not benefit from the guarantees of the 1998 Stability Agreement, none of the disputed Royalty and Tax Assessments applying the \"*non-stabilized regime*\u201d to the Concentrator constituted violations of the 1998 Stability Agreement. Therefore, in my colleagues' view, Respondent did not breach Clauses 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10.1 and 10.2. of the Stability Agreement.40\n\nAward, \u00b6 816.\n\n29.\n\nAs explained above, the majority misinterprets the stabilized regime. Under the 1998 Stability Agreement, the SMCV's Cerro Verde EAU (which included the Cerro Verde No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 Mining Concessions and the Beneficiation Concession) was stabilized and, upon their approval, all new investments made in such EAU while the Stability Agreement was in force should be considered stabilized.\n\n30.\n\nIn the course of 2004, Ms. Chappuis \u2013at the time, the Director General of Mining and the officer in charge of controlling compliance with the 1998 Stability Agreement41\u2013 confirmed to SMCV and Phelps Dodge that the 1998 Stability Agreement would apply to the planned concentrator as long as the investment was made in the existing mining unit or site as the 1998 Stability Agreement comprised all the investments made in such concessions.42 The expansion approval confirmed that the Concentrator fell within the Beneficiation Concession, already stabilized under the 1998 Stability Agreement. And, therefore, also confirmed that it benefitted from the stabilized regime.\n\nMining Law **(CA-1)**, Article 101(e) provides that \"*[t]he powers of the Directorate General of Mining are the following: \u2026(e) To ensure compliance with tax stability agreements\u2026*\u201d.\n\nChappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6\u00b6 28, 52-53 and Chappuis II (**CWS-14**), \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40. At the hearing, Ms. Chappuis ratified that she informed SMCV that the Concentrator was covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement, that no written confirmation was necessary and \u2013when asked by the Tribunal\u2013 she assumed personal responsibility for doing so. *See* Tr. 1011:17-1013:3 (Day 4) (Chappuis).\n\n31.\n\nThe majority has also concluded that Respondent did not breach Clauses 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10.1 and 10.2 of the Stability Agreement when certain of its Tax Assessments applying the non-stabilized regime to the stabilized activities (the so-called leaching activities) became final and enforceable.43 Although the majority accepts that \"*[i]t is undisputed between the Parties that such assessments were imposed on the stabilized leaching activities of Cerro Verde*\u201d,44 it concludes that as some of its activities were stabilized (leaching activities) and other not (the Concentrator activities), SMCV was required to keep separate accounts for each of them.45 As SMCV did not keep such separate accounts, it concludes that SUNAT's tax assessments on SMCV's stabilized project were not inappropriate.46\n\nAs explained in \u00b6 817 of the Award, Claimant alleges that (i) in the 2010 and 2011 Income Tax Assessments, SUNAT applied non-stabilized depreciation rates to certain assets without attributing them to the Concentrator and \u2013 in the 2012 and 2013 Income Tax Assessments \u2013 to all the assets that SMCV started using as of 2007, including some of the same leaching facilities' assets it had treated as stabilized in previous fiscal years; (ii) in the 2007-2013 Income Tax Assessments, SUNAT denied SMCV's income tax deductions for PTU, expenses accrued in prior years, and recreational expenses, as well as deductions for payments that SMCV recorded using the classification system applicable under the Stability Agreement; and (iii) SUNAT assessed the following taxes from which SMCV was exempted by operation of the 1998 Stability Agreement against the entire Cerro Verde Mining Unit: 2009-2013 TTNA; 2007-2013 AIT and the 2013 CMPF. *See also* Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 124.\n\nAward, \u00b6 818.\n\nAward, \u00b6 824.\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 820-828.\n\n32.\n\nAs explained, under SMCV's stabilized regime, all the investments made in the Cerro Verde's EAU or Mining Unit while the Stability Agreement was in force should be considered stabilized. Therefore, no Tax Assessments applying the non-stabilized regime should have been issued concerning the Cerro Verde's EAU. In addition, SMCV was not required to keep separate accounts for the Leaching and Concentrator activities as both activities were performed in the same Mining Unit/EAU47 and were equally stabilized under the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\nArticle 22 of the Mining Regulations **(CA-432)** provides that \"[*t]o determine the results of its operations, **a mining activity titleholder that has other concessions or Economic-Administrative Units** shall keep independent accounts and reflect them in separate earning statements*\u201d (emphasis added).\n\n33.\n\nRespondent's repudiation of its obligations under the 1998 Stability Agreement also constitute arbitrary actions that violate Freeport and SMCV's rights to a fair and equitable treatment under Article 10.5 of the Treaty. The legal framework existing in 1998 made clear that the Mining Law's stability guarantees would apply to the entire mining unit or concession and, therefore, all investments made within a stabilized concession or mining unit should have benefitted of the stability guarantees.\n\n34.\n\nEven if there was any doubt that the 1998 Stability Agreement covered new investments in the Cerro Verde's EAU while the Stability Agreement was in force \u2013a doubt which in my view did not exist\u2013 Respondent's actions should still be framed as unfair and inequitable under Article 10.5 of the TPA.\n\n35.\n\nSMVC's position that it was not required to pay royalties and taxes was reasonable and consistent under the legal regime existing at the time of execution of the 1998 Stability Agreement. Such view was reaffirmed by senior officials as Ms. Chappuis and by enacting the 2014 and 2019 amendments to the Mining Law and Mining Regulations, Respondent itself took the view that, at a minimum, the prior versions of those regulations were ambiguous and casted reasonable doubts as to their correct interpretation.\n\n36.\n\nIn such circumstances, Respondent's decisions not to waive penalties and interest when it had the possibility to do so48 and to retain both the GEM overpayments and the Royalty Assessments \u2013when both Parties agree that either royalties or GEM payments could be owed but never both49\u2013 constitute, in my view, additional arbitrary actions that violated Freeport and SMCV's rights to a fair and equitable treatment under Article 10.5 of the Treaty.\n\n*See* Articles 92(g) (\"*Subjects are entitled,* inter alia*, to: g) Request the non-application of interest and adjustment for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index, if applicable, and of penalties in case of reasonable doubt or conflicting criteria in accordance with the provisions of Article 170*\u201d) and 170 *(*\"*The assessment of interest, restatement of inflation based on the Consumer Price index or the assessment of penalties is not applicable if: 1. As a result of the misinterpretation of a provision, no amount of the tax debt related to said interpretation had been paid until the clarification thereof, provided the clarifying provision expressly states that this paragraph is applicable*\u201d) of the Peruvian Tax Code (**CA-14**). When referring to Article 170, Mr. Bravo confirmed at the hearing that the waiver of penalties and interest could also take place in other cases (Tr. 2692:21-2693:22 (Day 9) (Bravo)).\n\nAward, \u00b6 1003. In order to deny the claim for GEM overpayments, the majority interprets that the five-year statute of limitations set out in Article 1274 of the Civil Code should be disregarded and that the four-year term established in the Tax Code should be applied. Award, \u00b6\u00b6 1006-1010. I disagree. GEM payments were of a contractual nature and not tax payments. The construction sustained by the majority through Clauses 3 and 8 of the GEM Agreement **(CE-64**) and Article 5 of Law 29790 **(CA-181**) in order to apply the most restrictive rule \u2013 the one applicable to taxes \u2013 in the enforcement of contractual obligations run contrary to the very same (contractual) nature of the GEM payments and denies Claimant any possibility of exercising its rights. In addition, GEM payments only applied to companies with stability agreements that were exempted from royalties and Special Mining Tax (SMT) payments. SMCV made voluntarily GEM payments during 2012-2014 based on the premise that its entire Mining Unit was stabilized. Between June 2011 and April 2016, SMCV did not receive any royalties' assessments. SUNAT resumed assessing royalties against SMCV for the activities of the Concentrator in April 2016 and only in late 2017 the tax authority started assessing royalties and SMT against SMCV for the periods corresponding to the GEM payments (Q4/2011-2013). Therefore, it was only when SUNAT started assessing royalties and SMT against SMCV for the activities of the Concentrator that GEM payments became overpayments and Claimant was allowed to seek their refund. *See* Bullard II **(CER-7)**, \u00b6\u00b6 90-97 (explaining the interplay between Articles 1274 and 1993 of the Peruvian Civil Code).\n\n37.\n\nGiven the terms in which the majority of the Tribunal has ruled, I will render no opinion regarding the damages claimed.\n\nDate: 6 May 2024"}], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS**\n-------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1996 Feasibility Study | Revised version of the 1995 Fluor Canada Ltd. feasibility study for the improvements, upgrades, and further development of the existing leaching facility and infrastructure |\n| 1996 Mill Feasibility Study | Feasibility Study Analysis conducted by ICF Kaiser Engineers Inc., for the Cerro Verde Project from 1996 |\n| 1998 Mill Feasibility Study | Feasibility Study Analysis conducted by Bateman Engineering Inc.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**ICSID** or the **Centre**) pursuant to the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (the **TPA** or the **Treaty**),1 which was signed on 12 April 2006 and entered into force on 1 February 2009, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 and became binding on the Republic of Peru on 8 September 1993 and on the United States of America on 14 October 1966 (the **ICSID Convention**).\n\nUnited States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (**TPA**) (**CA-10**).\n\n**A. The Parties and their Representatives**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Freeport-McMoran Inc. (the **Claimant** or **Freeport**), an entity incorporated in the State of Delaware in the United States of America.2 The Claimant also brings its claim on behalf of Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A. (**SMCV**), a company constituted under the laws of Peru.3 Freeport indirectly owns 53.56% of the shares of SMCV and indirectly controls the company.4\n\nCertificate of Good Standing Freeport dated 18 February 2020 (**CE-263**).\n\nFreeport-McMoRan Inc., Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A. Corporate Organizational Chart dated 21 February 2020 (**CE-265**); SMCV, Certificate of Transition to Open Public Limited Company dated 11 January 2000 (**CE-366**).\n\nShare Purchase Agreement dated 17 March 1994 (**CE-4**); Freeport-McMoRan Inc., Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A. Corporate Organizational Chart dated 21 February 2020 (**CE-265**).\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Peru (the **Respondent** or **Peru**).\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the **Parties**.\n\n**B. The Dispute**\n------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe dispute concerns the imposition of certain royalties and taxes on SMCV by the Respondent.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent breached the stability agreement signed between SMCV and the Respondent on 26 February 1998 (the **1998 Stability Agreement**) every time the Respondent denied SMCV the stability guarantees of the 1998 Stability Agreement and unlawfully imposed royalties and taxes on SMCV. The Claimant also submits that the Respondent breached the minimum standard of treatment (**MST**) contained in Article 10.5 of the TPA (i) each time the disputed royalty assessments became enforceable against SMCV, (ii) each time the Respondent failed to waive the assessments of penalties and interest against SMCV, and (iii) each time the Respondent failed to reimburse SMCV for certain overpayments of mining contributions.\n\n7.\n\nAs a result of these alleged breaches, the Claimant claims that it is entitled to at least USD 942.2 million in damages plus interest, or, alternatively, to at least USD 719.9 million plus interest.\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Tribunal's jurisdiction over certain of the Claimant's claims on various accounts.\n\n9.\n\nOn the merits, the Respondent argues that it did not breach the 1998 Stability Agreement or its obligations under Article 10.5 of the TPA.\n\n10.\n\nIn the event that the Tribunal should nevertheless conclude that the Respondent has violated any such obligations, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's alleged damages are grossly inflated.\n\n**C. Requests for Relief**\n--------------------------\n\n11.\n\nIn its Memorial, the Claimant requested the following relief:\n\n*A. Declaring that Peru breached the Stability Agreement;*\n\n*B. Declaring that Peru breached Article 10.5 of the TPA;*\n\n*C.

In the alternative to C, ordering Peru to pay monetary damages to SMCV in an amount that would wipe out all the consequences of Peru's arbitrary failure to waive penalties and interest in breach of Article 10.5 of the TPA; arbitrary refusal to reimburse SMCV for the Q4 2011 to Q3 2012 GEM payments in breach [of] Article 10.5 of the TPA; and arbitrary failure to apply the non-stabilized regime to assets and activities that enjoyed stability even under Peru's own flawed interpretation of the Stability Agreement, valued at US$682.1 million as of 19 October 2021, and subject to updating closer to the date of the Award (the \"Alternative Claim\u201d).*\n\n*E. Ordering Peru to pay annually compounding post-award interest on Freeport's and SMCV's damages and losses at a rate equal to SMCV's cost of equity running from the date of the Award to the date full payment of those amounts is made;*\n\n*F. Ordering Peru to pay all the costs of the arbitration, as well as Freeport's and SMCV's attorneys' fees and expenses in an amount to be determined by such means as the Tribunal may direct;*\n\n*G. Declaring that all amounts paid by Peru are net of any Peruvian taxes or other fiscal obligations and ordering Peru to indemnify Freeport and SMCV with respect to any Peruvian tax imposed on such amounts; and*\n\n*H. Ordering any other such relief as the Tribunal may deem just and appropriate in the circumstances.*5\n\nClaimant's Memorial dated 19 October 2021 (**Claimant's Memorial**), \u00b6 464.\n\n12.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant \"*reserve[d] its rights to amend or supplement [its] Memorial, including the requested relief and the amounts claimed, and to seek further relief for additional breaches arising from Peru's past, present, or future conduct*.\u201d6\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 465.\n\n13.\n\nIn its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Claimant requested the following relief:\n\n*A. Dismissing Peru's objections to jurisdiction and declaring that it has jurisdiction over Freeport's claims;*\n\n*B. Declaring that Peru breached the Stability Agreement;*\n\n*C. Declaring that Peru breached Article 10.5 of the TPA;*\n\n*D. Ordering Peru to pay monetary damages to SMCV in an amount that would wipe out all the consequences of Peru's illegal acts, valued at US$942.4 million as of 13 September 2022, and subject to updating closer to the date of the Award (the \"Main Claim\u201d).*\n\n*E. In the alternative to D, ordering Peru to pay monetary damages to SMCV in an amount that would wipe out all the consequences of Peru's arbitrary failure to waive penalties and interest in breach of Article 10.5 of the TPA; arbitrary refusal to reimburse SMCV for the Q4 2011 to Q3 2012 GEM payments in breach Article 10.5 of the TPA; and arbitrary application of the non-stabilized regime to assets and activities that enjoyed stability even under Peru's own flawed interpretation of the Stability Agreement, valued at US$719.9 million as of 13 September 2022, and subject to updating closer to the date of the Award (the \"Alternative Claim\u201d).*\n\n*F. Ordering Peru to pay annually compounding post-award interest on Freeport's and SMCV's damages and losses at a rate equal to SMCV's cost of equity running from the date of the Award to the date full payment of those amounts is made;*\n\n*G.

CHRONOLOGY OF UNDISPUTED FACTS**\n---------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe following chronology of facts sets out in summary fashion the undisputed events forming the factual background of the dispute.\n\n**A. The initial exploration of the Cerro Verde mine (1880s to 1970s)**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n136.\n\nIn the mid-1880s, mining activities began at Cerro Verde, an open-pit copper and molybdenum mining complex located in the Arequipa Province of Peru.16 Cerro Verde's mineral deposits contain three types of copper ores: oxides, secondary sulfide, and primary sulfide.17 Each type of ore contains a different level of copper and is processed in a different manner, reflecting its copper content, the composition of the ore, and the cost to process the ore. While oxides and secondary sulfides are processed through leaching and solvent extraction/electrowinning (**SX/EW**) facilities, primary sulphides are usually processed through flotation in a concentrator plant. For most of Cerro Verde's history, mining operations have focused exclusively on the oxides and secondary sulfides.\n\n\"South America\u201d, Freeport-McMoRan dated 12 June 2019, *available at* https://www.fcx.com/operations/south-america#cerro\\_verde\\_link (**CE-222**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 30; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 64.\n\n137.\n\nFrom 1916 to 1970, Cerro Verde was owned by the U.S. company Anaconda Copper Mining (**Anaconda**), which commenced an initial exploration of the mine that led to it ultimately purchasing Cerro Verde's mineral rights.18\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 32; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 67.\n\n138.\n\nAnaconda initially exported excavated ore for processing abroad and in 1964, conducted additional studies concluding that local processing was feasible.19\n\nWright Engineers Ltd., Feasibility Study for the Cerro Verde Project for Empresa Minera del Per\u00fa dated 1 February 1972 (**CE-291**), Vol. II, pp. I-1 to I-2.\n\n139.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the nationalization of large sectors of the Peruvian economy began.20\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 32.\n\n140.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the state-owned company Empresa Minera del Per\u00fa (**Minero Peru**) took over the property of the Cerro Verde mine and operated it until 1993. The Government granted mining rights to Minero Peru to extract ore from the two open pits at Cerro Verde.21 These open pits were known as Cerro Verde and Santa Rosa, and the Ministry of Energy and Mines (**MINEM**) referred to them together as the \"*Economic and Administrative Unit known as Cerro Verde*.\u201d22\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 67; Direct Exploitation by the State of Mining Rights in the Department of Arequipa, Supreme Decree No. 023-70-EM/DGM dated 15 December 1970 (**CE-287**); Establishing the Right of the State Over Expired Metal Concessions, Supreme Decree No. 012-72-EM/DGM, 20 January 1972 (**CE-289**).\n\nDirect Exploitation by the State of Mining Rights in the Department of Arequipa, Supreme Decree No. 023-70-EM/DGM dated 15 December 1970 (**CE-287**); Establishing the Right of the State Over Expired Metal Concessions, Supreme Decree No. 012-72-EM/DGM, 20 January 1972 (**CE-289**).\n\n**B. The initial development of the Cerro Verde mine and the first feasibility studies to build a concentrator (1971-1985)**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nOn 3 October 1971, Minero Peru signed a contract with engineering firms Wright Engineers Ltd., British Smelter Constructions Ltd., and Ralph M. Parsons Co., to help secure financing to construct facilities to process the oxides at Cerro Verde, and provide engineering, procurement, construction management and start-up supervision for the 23 project.\n\n142.\n\nOn 27 December 1971, Minero Peru signed a second contract with British Smelter Constructions Ltd. and Wright Engineers Ltd. to conduct a feasibility study for processing options for the entirety of the \"*Cerro Verde Economic and Administrative Unit*,\u201d including the primary sulfides.24\n\nWright Engineers Ltd., Feasibility Study for the Cerro Verde Project for Empresa Minera del Per\u00fa dated 1 February 1972 (**CE-290**), Vol. I, Introduction, p. iv.\n\n143.\n\nOn 7 February 1972, the engineering firms British Smelter Constructions Ltd. and Wright Engineers Ltd. submitted their feasibility study,25 which explored the possibility of exploiting the Cerro Verde mine in two different stages:\n\n- first, the study recommended building leaching facilities for the oxide ore near the surface;\n\n- second, the study proposed building a concentrator with a capacity of 20,000 MT/d to process the primary sulfides, which cannot be efficiently processed through leaching.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 35; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 67; Wright Engineers Ltd., Feasibility Study for the Cerro Verde Project for Empresa Minera del Per\u00fa dated 1 February 1972 (**CE-290**).\n\n144.\n\nOn 5 March 1975, after Minero Peru conducted further exploration of the primary sulfides revealing that minable ore at Cerro Verde exceeded an estimated 1 billion tons with an average grade of more than 0.5% copper, a 1975 feasibility study concluded that the enormous primary sulfide deposit could justify building a concentrator four to six times larger than the 20,000 MT/d concentrator.26\n\nRalph M. Parsons Co., Cerro Verde Project, Stage II: Preliminary Feasibility Study dated 5 March 1975 (**CE-292**), vol. I, p. I-2-3.\n\n145.\n\nIn 1976, Minero Peru decided to proceed to construct an on-site leaching plant to process oxide ore, abandoning plans to build a concentrator plant.27\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 36-37; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 67.\n\n146.\n\nOn 15 July 1976, MINEM granted Minero Peru's request to expand its two special mining rights within the \"*Cerro Verde Mining Unit.*\u201d28 It also granted it a mining concession to explore and extract mineral resources in an area called \"*Cerro Verde No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3.*\u201d29\n\nSupreme Decree No. 027-76-EM/DGM dated 19 July 1976 (**CE-2**).\n\nSupreme Decree No. 027-76-EM/DGM dated 19 July 1976 (**CE-2**).\n\n147.\n\nOn 13 January 1977, MINEM granted Minero Peru an additional \"*special right*\u201d to process the minerals that it extracted from Cerro Verde No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3 through a Beneficiation Plant.30\n\nSupreme Decree No. 002-77-EM/DGM dated 13 January 1977 (**CE-295**).\n\n148.\n\nOn 1 April 1977, Minero Peru's leaching plant started to operate with a capacity to produce 33,000 MT/year of copper cathodes from oxide ore.31\n\nWright Engineers Ltd., Copper: From Oxides to Cathodes dated April 1978 (**CE-296**), p. 2.\n\n149.\n\nIn 1977 and 1980, Minero Peru continued to explore the possibility of constructing a concentrator in two additional feasibility studies, which considered construction of a 60,000 MT/d concentrator but concluded that a plant of such size could not be built without an expensive new power source.32\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 39; Ralph M. Parsons Co., Feasibility Study dated 1977 (**CE-294**); Minero Per\u00fa & Kuhn Loeb Lehmann Brothers International Inc., Cerro Verde II: Project Memorandum dated October 1981 (**CE-297**), p. 1.\n\n150.\n\nIn 1979, Minero Peru constructed a pilot concentrator with a capacity of 100 MT/d.33 Minero Peru used this concentrator primarily to test the efficiency of the flotation process on Cerro Verde's primary sulfides, which Minero Peru would eventually have to process in order to extend the life of the mine beyond exhaustion of the oxide and secondary sulfide reserves.34\n\nMorgan Grenfell & Co.

The study's \"*principal conclusion*\u201d was that Cerro Verde's primary sulfides represented \"*one of the most viable of the future porphyry copper projects in world inventory at the present time*.\u201d37\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 41; Wright Engineers Ltd., Cerro Verde\u2014II Stage Sulfide Ore: Feasibility Study dated March 1985 (**CE-300**), pp. 2-4.\n\n**C. The adoption of a mining regulatory framework in Peru, the privatization of Cerro Verde, and the creation of SMCV (1981-1994)**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n154.\n\nOn 12 June 1981, Peru adopted the General Mining Law (**L.D. 109**), that provided the legal framework for mining activities. In particular, L.D. 109 provided that the State may sign stabilization agreements with mining companies.38\n\nGeneral Mining Law, Legislative Decree No. 109 dated 12 June 1981 (**CA-37**), Articles 155, 157.\n\n155.\n\nIn August 1991, Peru's President Alberto Fujimori enacted Legislative Decree No. 662 (**L.D. 662**) approving a \"*Legal Stability Regime for Foreign Investment*,\u201d which set forth a number of guarantees meant to attract foreign investment such as tax stability, stability in foreign exchange, and protection of private property.39\n\nLegal Stability Regime for Foreign Investment by Recognizing Certain Guarantees, Legislative Decree No. 662 dated 29 August 1991 (L.D. 662) (**CE-304**); *see also* CONITE, *Peru Welcomes Investors* (detailing benefits of L.D. 662) (**CE-815**).\n\n156.\n\nIn September 1991, the Government established a legal framework for privatization by creating the Commission to Promote Private Investment (**COPRI**) to coordinate the sale of State-owned assets, and the Special Committee to Promote Private Investment in Production Units (**CEPRI**), a committee within Minero Peru, to organize the auction of Minero Peru's holdings.40\n\nPromotion of Private Investment in Enterprises of the State, Legislative Decree No. 674 dated 27 September 1991 (**CE-305**); CEPRI, General Act for the Promotion of Private Investment in the Production Units of Minero Per\u00fa dated 31 May 1996 (**CE-349**), pp. 1, 8; *see also* Supreme Resolution No. 142-93 dated 22 April 1993 (**CE-325**).\n\n157.\n\nOn 6 November 1991, the Government enacted Legislative Decree No. 708, the \"*Law for the Promotion of Investments in the Mining Sector*\u201d (**L.D. 708**),41 which supplemented the existing legal framework for mining adopted in 1981, *i.e.,* L.D. 109.

A company can have [a] stabilization agreement for one project and not have it for another [project], or [can] have an old activity that does not have a stabilization agreement and a new one that does.

SUNAT denied SMCV's reconsideration requests for the 2008 to 2011 AIT Assessments, which SMCV challenged before the Tax Tribunal.\n\n436.\n\nIn February 2020, SMCV withdrew the stability-related claims from its challenges against the AIT Assessments.\n\n**5.

SUNAT did not rule on SMCV's challenge on the 2011 TTNA Assessments and SMCV thus challenged the 2011 TTNA Assessments before the Tax Tribunal.\n\n441.\n\nThe Tax Tribunal confirmed the fine that SUNAT imposed in the 2013 TTNA Assessments and did not rule on the other challenges.\n\n442.\n\nIn February 2020, SMCV withdrew its stability-related claims for the 2009-2011 TTNA Assessments before the Tax Tribunal issued a decision as well as its request for reconsideration before SUNAT for the 2013 TTNA Assessments.\n\n**6. The Special Mining Tax Assessments and Complementary Mining Pension Fund Assessments imposed on SMCV**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n443.\n\nOn 29 December 2017 and 28 September 2018, SUNAT issued assessments against SMCV for, respectively, the fourth quarter of 2011 through the fourth quarter of 2012, and each quarter of 2013, for the SMT (collectively, the **SMT Assessments**).427 SUNAT also imposed penalties for SMCV's failure to file SMT declarations.\n\nSUNAT, Fine Resolution No. 012-002-0031072 (SMT 4Q 2011) dated 29 December 2017 (**CE-168**), Annex 1; SUNAT, Fine Resolution No. 012-002-0031093 (SMT 1Q 2012) dated 29 December 2017 (**CE-169**), Annex 1; SUNAT, Fine Resolution No. 012-002-0031094 (SMT 2Q 2012) dated 29 December 2017 (**CE-170**), Annex 1; SUNAT, Fine Resolution No. 012-002-0031095 (SMT 3Q 2012) dated 29 December 2017 (**CE-171**), Annex 1; SUNAT, Fine Resolution No. 012-002-0031096 (SMT 4Q 2012) dated 29 December 2017 (**CE-172**), Annex 1; SUNAT, Resolution No. 0150140014441 (SMT 4Q 2011-4Q 2012) dated 12 October 2018 (**CE-198**), pp. 39-40; SUNAT, Assessments No. 012-003-0099078 to No. 012-003-0099081 (SMT for 2013) dated 28 September 2018 (**CE-195**).\n\n444.\n\nOn 20 December 2019, SUNAT issued an assessment charging SMCV with contributions for fiscal year 2013 to the Complementary Mining Pension Fund (the **2013 CMPF Assessment**), a social security fund composed of 0.5% of employees' monthly gross compensation and 0.5% of mining companies' annual pre-tax income.428\n\nSUNAT, Assessment No. 0120030109172 (CMPF for 2013) dated 20 December 2019 (**CE-237**).\n\n445.\n\nSMCV submitted requests for reconsideration for the Q4 2011-2012 and 2013 SMT Assessments, both of which SUNAT rejected. SMCV also challenged the Q4 2011-2012 SMT Assessments before the Tax Tribunal, which upheld SUNAT's Assessments. SMCV also submitted a request for reconsideration for the 2013 CMPF Assessment, which SMCV eventually withdrew in February 2020.\n\n446.\n\nOn 25 June 2019 and 13 August 2019, SMCV requested under protest to enter into deferral and installment plans to pay the 2013 and Q4 2011-2012 SMT Assessments, respectively.429 On 1 July 2019 and 16 August 2019, SUNAT approved SMCV's deferral and installment plans.430 On 18 August 2020, SMCV agreed with SUNAT to defer and combine the two deferral and instalment plans into a single plan under a more lenient regime known as the RAF regime (*r\u00e9gimen de aplazamiento y fraccionamiento*).431 On 13 August 2021, under protest, SMCV made a payment to pay off the outstanding balance under the RAF Plan.432\n\nSMCV, Request Under Protest to Enter into Deferral and Installment Plans (SMT for 2013) dated 25 June 2019 (**CE-759**); SMCV, Request Under Protest to Enter into Deferral and Installment Plans (SMT for Q4 2011-12) dated 13 August 2019 (**CE-764**).\n\nSUNAT, Approval of SMCV's Deferral and Installment Plans (SMT for 2013) dated 1 July 2019 (**CE-760**); SUNAT, Approval of SMCV's Deferral and Installment Plans (SMT for Q4 2011-12) dated 16 August 2019 (**CE-765**).\n\nSUNAT, Approval of RAF Regime (SMT for Q4 2011-2013) dated 18 August 2020 (**CE-786**).\n\nSMT RAF Payments dated February 2021 to August 2021 (**CE-838**).\n\n**7. SMCV's requests for reimbursement of GEM payments**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n447.\n\nOn 28 December 2017, SMCV submitted reimbursement requests to SUNAT under protest for undue GEM payments corresponding to the periods Q4 2012 to Q4 2013.433\n\nSMCV, Reimbursement Request (GEM Q4 2012) dated 12 January 2018 (**CE-705**); SMCV, Reimbursement Request (GEM Q1 2013) dated 12 January 2018 (**CE-706**); SMCV, Reimbursement Request (GEM Q2 2013) dated 12 January 2018 (**CE-707**); SMCV, Reimbursement Request (GEM Q3 2013) dated 12 January 2018 (**CE-708**); SMCV, Reimbursement Request (GEM Q4 2013) dated 12 January 2018 (**CE-709**).\n\n448.\n\nOn 18 December 2018, SUNAT approved SMCV's request for reimbursement of undue GEM payments corresponding to the periods Q4 2012 to Q4 2013 and ordered the reimbursement of SMCV's overpayments plus interest.434\n\nSUNAT, Resolution No. 012 180 0018113/SUNAT (GEM for Q4 2012) dated 18 December 2018 (**CE-746**); SUNAT, Resolution No. 012 180 0018114/SUNAT (GEM for 2013) dated 18 December 2018 (**CE-747**).\n\n449.\n\nOn 28 December 2018, SMCV submitted reimbursement requests under protest for the remaining GEM overpayments corresponding to Q4 2011 to Q3 2012.435\n\nSMCV, Reimbursement Request, (GEM Q4 2011) dated 28 December 2018 (**CE-208**); SMCV, Reimbursement Request, (GEM Q1 2012) dated 28 December 2018 (**CE-209**); SMCV, Reimbursement Request, (GEM Q2 2012) dated 28 December 2018 (**CE-210**); SMCV, Reimbursement Request, (GEM Q3 2012) dated 28 December 2018 (**CE-211**).\n\n450.\n\nOn 4 March 2019, SUNAT denied SMCV's request for reimbursement of GEM payments for the period Q4 2011-Q3 2012 on the basis that the statute of limitations for such claims had expired on the first business day of 2017.436\n\nSUNAT, Resolution No. 012-180-0018640/SUNAT dated 4 March 2019 (**CE-218**).\n\n**8.

The most recent summary of proceedings is the table set out in Annex A of the Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits, which the Tribunal has reproduced and attaches to this Award as Appendix I.\n\n**9. Initiation of this arbitration**\n-------------------------------------\n\n452.\n\nOn 26 November 2019, Freeport submitted a Notice of Intent advising Peru that a dispute had arisen concerning Freeport's investment.437\n\nClaimants' Notice of Intent to Commence Arbitration under the United States-Peru Trade Agreement dated 27 November 2019 (**CE-271**).\n\n453.\n\nOn 28 February 2020, Freeport filed its Notice of Arbitration.438\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration.\n\n**IV. JURISDICTION**\n--------------------\n\n454.\n\nIn this section of the Award, the Tribunal will deal with the Respondent's objections regarding jurisdiction.\n\n455.\n\nSpecifically, the Tribunal will have to decide on five issues:\n\na. Are the Claimant's claims time-barred under Article 10.18.1 of the TPA?\n\nb. Are the Claimant's claims based on penalties and interest outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction because they constitute \"*taxation measures*\u201d which are excluded from the scope of the TPA under Article 22.3.1 of the TPA?\n\nc. Are the Claimant's claims arising from the Royalty and Tax Assessments based on acts or facts that occurred before the TPA entered into force, and thus outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Article 10.1.3 of the TPA?\n\nd. Is the Claimant precluded from submitting claims on the basis of the Tax and Royalty Assessments before this Tribunal on the basis of Article 10.18.4 of the TPA?\n\ne. May the Claimant submit claims concerning the breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement on behalf of SMCV under Article 10.16.1(b) of the TPA?\n\n456.\n\nThe Parties have briefed the Tribunal on these issues and the NDP on some of them. In what follows, the Tribunal will set out its analysis of these five issues. The Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the Claimant's claims are within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, save for the Claimant's claims based on penalties and interest assessed on Tax Assessments, which the majority finds to be outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n**A. The Respondent's claim that the Claimant's claims are time-barred**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n457.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Claimant has failed to file its claims within the limitations period under Article 10.18.1 of the TPA.439\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 412 *et seq*.; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 694 *et seq.*; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 278 *et seq.*\n\n458.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the TPA prohibits the submission of claims to arbitration if more than three years have passed from the date on which a claimant first knew or should have known of the alleged breaches, and that it incurred related loss or damage. The Respondent contends that the Claimant submitted its Notice of Arbitration on 28 February 2020 but that it was aware more than three years before that date, *i.e*., before 28 February 2017, of the Royalty and Tax Assessments, and related measures such as SUNAT's imposition of penalties and interest. Accordingly, the Claimant's claims based on those alleged breaches fall outside of the TPA's limitations period, and, therefore, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear those claims.440\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 412; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 694.\n\n459.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the legal test developed by tribunals to determine whether a claimant's claims satisfy limitation periods such as the one set out in Article 10.18.1 of the TPA is the following: \"*(i) first, [the tribunal] must identify the cut-off date for the three-year limitations period; (ii) second, it must determine whether the [c]laimant knew or should have known of the alleged breach or breaches before that cut-off date; and (iii) third, it must determine whether the [c]laimant knew or should have known that it had incurred loss or damage before that date*.\u201d441 Relying *inter alia* on the findings of *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, the Respondent contends that the claims must have been submitted to arbitration within three years of \"*the earliest possible date*\u201d when the Claimant first knew or should have first known of the alleged breaches and loss or damage.442 As the *Resolute Forest v. Canada* tribunal explained, \"*[t]he triggering event is the knowledge, actual or constructive, that an alleged breach has occurred and that loss or damage has been incurred as a result*.\u201d443 The Respondent further argues that the TPA's limitations period should be interpreted strictly to bar untimely claims,444 and that its interpretation of the TPA is consistent with that of the United States.445\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 412, referring to: *Infinito Gold Ltd. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/14/5, Award dated 3 June 2021 (**RA-1**), \u00b6 217; *Spence International Investments LLC, Berkowitz et al. v.

Canada*, PCA Case No. 2016/13, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 30 January 2018 (**RA-5**), \u00b6 153.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 417, referring to: *Corona Materials v.

Costa Rica*, Interim Award (**RA-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 210, 227; *Infinito Gold v. Costa Rica*, Award (**RA-1**), \u00b6 247; *Mondev International Ltd. v.

USA*, Decision on Jurisdiction (**RA-4**), \u00b6 81; *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, Award on Preliminary Objections (**RA-3**), \u00b6 215.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 422, 431-434; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 726 *et seq*., referring to: *Spence v. Costa Rica*, Interim Award (**RA-2**), \u00b6 208; *Apotex v. USA*, Award on Jurisdiction (**RA-7**), \u00b6\u00b6 328, 330-332; *Grand River v. USA*, Decision on Jurisdiction (**RA-4**), \u00b6 81; *Mondev v. USA*, Award (**RA-6**), \u00b6 87.\n\n464.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the first date on which the Claimant first knew or should have known of SUNAT's alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement was when SMCV was notified of the first assessment from SUNAT on 18 August 2009, indicating that SMCV owed royalty payments for its activities related to the Concentrator Project for the years 2006-2007.452 This is because at that moment, SMCV (and thus the Claimant) knew how SUNAT interpreted the 1998 Stability Agreement and that SMCV knew or should have known that it had incurred (or would incurr) loss or damages on the basis of that interpretation.453 The Assessment expressly stated the support and legal basis for the assessment and indicated that SMCV was required to pay royalties on that basis. In addition, the Assessment also stated the penalties and interest that SMCV owed for failing to timely pay the royalties for its Concentrator Project, as well as additional penalties. As a matter of Peruvian law, the amounts stated in the Assessment were immediately due and owing to SUNAT, and therefore were liabilities of SMCV.454 SMCV experienced financial harm (in the form of increased liabilities) at that moment, even if its cash outlay came at a later time.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 424-425, referring to: Claimant's Memorial at Annex A, p. 1; SUNAT 2006/07 Royalty Assessments dated 17 August 2009 (**CE-31**), p. 1 of PDF; SMCV Request for Reconsideration, 2006/07 Royalty Assessments dated 15 September 2009 (**CE-32**), p. 1.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 424 *et seq*.; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 712 *et seq.*, referring to: *Resolute Forest Products v. Canada*, Decision on Jurisdiction (**RA-5**), \u00b6 153.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 427, referring to: Bravo-Pic\u00f3n I (**RER-3**), \u00b6 61; Morales I (**RER-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 106-107.\n\n465.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, SMCV incurred the loss or damage at the moment that it was required to pay the Assessment, which under Peruvian law was immediately as of the date of issuance of the Assessment.455 Therefore, the limitations period for that alleged breach should have started running on 18 August 2009.456\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 438.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 435; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 698.\n\n466.\n\nAs for all subsequently issued Royalty Assessments against SMCV for the tax periods 2008, 2009, 2010-2011, Q4 2011, 2012, and 2013, as well as the Tax Assessments for the periods of 2005 through 2013, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's characterization of these assessments as separate acts and, therefore, separate alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement.457 The Respondent argues that they all represent a series of similar and related actions by a respondent state because the assessments are all based on SUNAT's consistent interpretation of the scope of the very same contract, the 1998 Stability Agreement.458\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 429.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 429; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 700, referring to: *Grand River v. USA*, Decision on Jurisdiction (**RA-4**), \u00b6 81; *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, Award on Preliminary Objections (**RA-3**), \u00b6 215.\n\n467.\n\nAlternatively, if the Tribunal were not to accept the Respondent's proposition that the Claimant first knew or should have known of the alleged breaches on 18 August 2009, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal should conclude that the Claimant knew or should have known of the alleged breaches and loss no later than 15 September 2009, when SMCV requested SUNAT to reconsider the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessment.459 The Respondent states that from the moment SMCV exercised its right to challenge the first assessment issued against it through SUNAT's Claims Division, SMCV was in a position to bring a legal claim challenging the measure.460 With this challenge, SMCV formally disputed the legal basis upon which SUNAT issued the Assessment (*i.e*., the applicability or not of the 1998 Stability Agreement).461 The Respondent relies *inter alia* on the conclusions reached by the *Spence v. Costa Rica* tribunal, which considered the date on which a claimant challenged the respondent's regulatory conduct as the date on which the claimant knew or should have known of the alleged breach.462 Furthermore, the Respondent follows the *Grand River v. United States* tribunal's finding that loss is incurred when liability is accrued463 and that the Claimant (and SMCV) knew or should have known that SMCV had incurred loss by the time SMCV challenged the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessment through SUNAT's Claims Division. This is because SMCV incurred the loss or damage at the moment that it was required to pay the Assessment, which under Peruvian law was immediately as of the date of issuance of the Assessment.464\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 701; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 436, referring to: SMCV Request for Reconsideration, 2006/07 Royalty Assessments dated 15 September 2009 (**CE-32**).\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 437; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 702.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 437.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 437, referring to: *Spence v. Costa Rica*, Interim Award (**RA-2**), \u00b6 250.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 438, referring to: *Grand River v. USA*, Decision on Jurisdiction (**RA-4**), \u00b6 77; *Mondev v. USA*, Award (**RA-6**) \u00b6 87.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 438; Bravo-Pic\u00f3n I (**RER-3**), \u00b6 61; Morales I (**RER-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 106-107.\n\n468.\n\nThe Respondent argues that even if the Tribunal were to exclude the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Assessments from its consideration because the Claimant has strategically elected not to claim for those amounts, the Claimant's claims regarding the alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement still fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction because the Claimant knew or should have known of the alleged breaches and related loss or damage well before the 28 February 2017 limitations period cut-off date. In particular, the Respondent states that SMCV was notified of the 2009 Royalty Assessment (which is included in Claimant's claims) on 8 July 2011, and it appealed that decision before SUNAT's Claims Division on 9 August 2011, *i.e.*, many years before the limitations cut-off in February 2017.465\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 703.\n\n469.\n\nThe Respondent offers another alternative according to which even if the Tribunal were to consider knowledge of the alleged breaches based on Tax Assessments to be separate from knowledge of the alleged breaches based on Royalty Assessments, the Claimant's claims would still fall outside of the limitations period:\n\n1) The date when the Claimant first knew or should have known of the alleged breaches on the basis of the Royalty Assessments was 18 August 2009. As all of SUNAT's subsequent Royalty Assessments, which were made on the same legal basis, constitute a \"*series of similar and related actions*,\u201d all claims for breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement arising from the Royalty Assessments must fall outside of the limitations period and, thus, fall outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.466\n\n2) The date when the Claimant first knew or should have known of the alleged breaches on the basis of the Tax Assessments was 30 December 2009, when SMCV received notice from SUNAT that it owed GST related to the copper products produced through the Concentrator.467 The Respondent contends that 28 January 2010, the date when SMCV challenged such Tax Assessment before SUNAT, could be the last date when the statute of limitations should have started running.468 Since all of SUNAT's subsequent Tax Assessments constitute a \"*series of similar and related actions*\u201d in that they all rely on the same construction of the 1998 Stability Agreement, all of SMCV's breach of contract claims based on any of the subsequent Tax Assessments also fall outside of the limitations period, and, thus, outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.469\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 441.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 442.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 442; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 704.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 442.\n\n470.\n\nIn any case, the Respondent asserts that all of the alternative dates it proposes occurred long before the cut-off date of 28 February 2017 and, thus, the Claimant's claims based on Royalty and Tax Assessments fall outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.470\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 440-444.\n\n**b) The alleged breaches of the TPA**\n--------------------------------------\n\n471.\n\nWith respect to the alleged breaches of Article 10.5 of the TPA, the Respondent submits that most of these claims fall outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n472.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's claims on the basis of legitimate expectations, arbitrary action and inconsistent and non-transparent action under Article 10.5 of the TPA, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's claims are all related to the Royalty Assessments, and because SUNAT's Assessments are \"*a series of similar and related acts of the respondent state*,\u201d471 the knowledge of the alleged breaches based on that series of governmental acts attaches the first act, *i.e*., the first Assessment (the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessment). The Respondent submits that the only dates when the Claimant first knew or should have known of these alleged breaches of the TPA are, as with the alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement, either 18 August 2009 or 15 September 2009 at the latest,472 thus making the Claimant's claims time-barred in accordance with Article 10.18.1 of the TPA. According to the Respondent, on both of those dates, the Claimant knew or should have known that SUNAT interpreted the 1998 Stability Agreement as not including activities related to the Concentrator Project.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 749, referring to: *Grand River v.

Rather, what is important is the moment when the Claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged and knowledge that the Claimant or the enterprise has incurred loss or damage.475 The Respondent argues that the Claimant's only due process claims that could remain before the Tribunal in the face of the limitations period are limited to its allegations that the Tax Tribunal (i) failed to recuse a \"*conflicted decision-maker*,\u201d (ii) copy-pasted portions of the 2008 Royalty Case decision into the 2009 Royalty Case decision, and (iii) improperly assigned the 2010-2011 Royalty Case to Ms. Villanueva, because those events occurred after the cut-off date of 28 February 2017.476\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 451-453; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 757 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 453.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 758.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 454; Minutes of Plenary Council Meeting No. 2018-20 dated 21 June 2018 (**CE-181**); Tax Tribunal Chamber 2 Decision No. 06141-2-2018 dated 15 August 2018 (**CE-188**); Tax Tribunal Decision, No. 10574-9-2019 dated 18 November 2019 (**CE-269**); Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 761.\n\n474.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's claim that the Respondent allegedly arbitrarily failed to waive the penalties and interest assessed against SMCV for the Royalty and Tax Assessments, the Respondent submits that all of the Claimant's claims concerning SUNAT's refusal to waive penalties and interest on its Royalty and Tax Assessments issued against SMCV fall outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.477 First, all of the Claimant's claims based on SUNAT's decision not to waive penalties and interest arising from SUNAT's Tax Assessments against SMCV should be rejected, since Article 22.3.1 of the TPA expressly excludes taxation measures from the scope of protection under Chapter Ten of the TPA.478 Second, with respect to the penalties and interest that SUNAT maintained on its Royalty Assessments against SMCV, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's claims under the TPA are time-barred because the Claimant first knew or should have known of the alleged Article 10.5 TPA breaches based on SUNAT's maintenance of the penalties and interest imposed on the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments no later than 22 April 2010, when SUNAT notified SMCV that it confirmed its Royalty Assessment as well as the corresponding penalties and interest arising therefrom.479 As SUNAT's rejections of SMCV's requests for waivers of the penalties and interest for all subsequent Royalty Assessments were all based on the same provisions of the Mining Law and Regulations and on the same interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement, it follows that SUNAT's rejections of SMCV's requests were all part of a \"*series of similar or related actions*\u201d by SUNAT.480 Thus, in the Respondent's view, they do not give rise to separate breaches and the limitations period did not renew upon each denial. Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's claims under the TPA regarding SUNAT's maintenance of the penalties and interest on the Royalty Assessments fall outside of the limitations period and, thus, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear those claims.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 762 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 456-458; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 763.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 459; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 764.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 462; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 765; Respondent's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6 29.\n\n475.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Claimant's framing of its claims as a \"*failure to waive*\u201d penalties and interest is an attempt to delay the start date of the limitations period to as late as possible. The Respondent argues that the Claimant's real complaint is actually about SUNAT's imposition of penalties and interest, which occurred much earlier.481 The Respondent submits that even if the Tribunal were to accept the Claimant's characterization of its penalties and interest claims, the only claim that would survive the limitations period would be the claim related to the Contentious Administrative Appellate Court's decision on SMCV's waiver requests related to the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessment, which was issued on 12 July 2017.482 The Respondent further notes that the Claimant's allegations that penalties-and-interest claims related to the Royalty Assessments only occurred each time the Assessments become final and enforceable are incorrect.483\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 766.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 768.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 767; Respondent's Rejoinder, section III.A.1.\n\n476.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's claim that the Respondent allegedly arbitrarily and unreasonably refused to refund the GEM payments that SMCV made for Q4 2011 through Q3 2012, the Respondent does not dispute that the Claimant's claim was timely, given that SMCV was notified of SUNAT's decision rejecting SMCV's refund request on 22 March 2019.484\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 769; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 464; SUNAT, Resolution No. 012-180-0018640/SUNAT dated 4 March 2019 (**CE-218**), p. 1.\n\n477.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent submits that the only claims that survive the application of the limitations period of the TPA are those of alleged breaches of the TPA based on (a) due process violations related to the Tax Tribunal's alleged (i) failure to recuse a \"*conflicted decision maker*\u201d, (ii) copy-and-paste of portions of the 2008 Royalty Case decision into the 2009 Royalty Case decision, and (iii) improper assignment of the 2010-2011 Royalty Case to Ms. Villanueva, (b) the Contentious Administrative Appellate Court's alleged failure to review *de novo* SMCV's waiver request related to the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessment, and (c) SUNAT's alleged failure to refund GEM payments made for Q4 2011 through Q3 2012. Among those, however, claims (b) and (c) are outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction on the basis of Article 10.1.3 of the TPA.485\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, fn. 1395.\n\n**2. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n478.\n\nThe Claimant submits that all of its claims were submitted to arbitration within the three-year limitation period under Article 10.18.1 of the TPA.486\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 211 *et seq.*; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 11 *et seq.*; Claimant's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 4 *et seq.*; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 91 *et seq.*\n\n479.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, under the terms of Article 10.18.1 of the TPA, the limitation period can only start after a claimed breach has occurred and the claimant has incurred damage. The Claimant submits that it acquired knowledge of each of the alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement and the TPA and the respective losses or damages incurred after the 28 February 2017 cut-off date.\n\n480.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the NDP submission supports its argument that Article 10.18.1 of the TPA does not bar the Claimant's claims for breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement and Article 10.5 of the TPA.487\n\nClaimant's Comments on the US NDP Submission, \u00b6 4.\n\n**a) The alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n481.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement did not occur until each Assessment became final and enforceable. Specifically, each final and enforceable Royalty or Tax Assessment gave rise to a separate breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n482.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees with the Respondent's assertion that the limitation period was triggered either on 18 August 2009, 15 September 2009, or 8 July 2011, if the Tribunal excludes the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Assessments from its determination of when the limitation period began to run; or either 30 December 2009 or 28 January 2010, if the Tribunal finds that knowledge of the breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement resulting from the Tax Assessments cannot be \"*imputed*\u201d from the earlier Royalty Assessments.488 Rather, according to the Claimant, its claims for breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement are timely.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 212.\n\n483.\n\nFirst, the Claimant submits that under the terms of Article 10.18.1 of the TPA, the limitation period can only start after a claimed breach has occurred and the claimant has incurred damage. The Claimant states that the Respondent's argument that the limitation period for each of the Claimant's claims commenced at the date of notification of the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments is incorrect because the wording of Article 10.18.1 of the TPA provides that the limitation period does not start to run until the claimant has knowledge: (i) of the alleged breach, and (ii) that the claimant or the enterprise has incurred loss or damage.489 The Claimant submits that there is no support in the TPA for the Respondent's argument that the limitation period begins when a claimant acquires knowledge of the \"*legal basis*\u201d upon which a respondent will commit future breaches, which will cause losses or damages to be incurred.490 According to the Claimant, the wording of the TPA is such that it does not require knowledge that a claimant \"*would incur*\u201d loss or damage, but that it \"*has incurred*\u201d loss or damage. The Claimant submits that this approach has been confirmed by other arbitral tribunals, *e.g.*, in *Eli Lilly v. Canada*, *Resolute Forest v. Canada*, *Pope & Talbot v. Canada*, and *Mobil II v. Canada*.491 According to the Claimant, this approach makes sense and is consistent with the intent of the Treaty parties. If the limitation period began to run before the government measure resulted in a breach and before the investor incurred loss or damage, investors would be encouraged to file international arbitration claims that are not yet ripe for adjudication.492 The Claimant submits that the NDP submission confirms that the Claimant could not have acquired knowledge of the breach and loss resulting from each Assessment until the relevant assessment became final and enforceable.493\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 215-216; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 15-19.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 17.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 217; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 17, referring to: *Eli Lilly and Company v.

United States*, *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, and *Resolute Forest v. Canada* cases when asserting that a treaty's limitations period should be interpreted strictly.494 The Claimant purports that those decisions do not indicate that anything other than the ordinary rules of treaty interpretation apply to the interpretation of the NAFTA and CAFTA-DR limitation provisions, and that those tribunals merely observed that the limitation provisions in those treaties should be interpreted according to their plain terms and could not be modified by the tribunal.495\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 219.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 219.\n\n485.\n\nSecond, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement did not occur until each assessment became final and enforceable.496 According to the Claimant, it was only at such point that the relevant Assessment caused SMCV to incur loss or damage.497 The Claimant states that the Respondent agrees that the Assessments did not become final and enforceable until the conclusion of the administrative process for each assessment.498 The Claimant argues that Royalty and Tax Assessments become final and enforceable (i) on the business day after the taxpayer's deadline for submitting a challenge before SUNAT or the Tax Tribunal expires without the taxpayer having filed a challenge, (ii) on the business day after the taxpayer is served with the Tax Tribunal's resolution confirming the denial of the request for reconsideration, and (iii) if the taxpayer withdrew one or all of the claims, the business day after the taxpayer is served with the SUNAT or Tax Tribunal's resolution accepting the taxpayer's withdrawal.499 Moreover, before the Assessments became final and enforceable, they were not final administrative decisions because SUNAT's Claims Division (or the Tax Tribunal) could have corrected the Assessments.500 The Claimant also submits that under Peruvian law, SMCV was under no obligation to pay the Assessments until they became final and enforceable, nor could have the tax administration enforced the Assessments.501 Therefore, only once a particular Assessment became final and enforceable did the breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement occur, because the Government through the use of its public powers implemented the non-stabilized regime against SMCV.502 It is also on the date each Assessment became final and enforceable that SMCV incurred loss.503\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 220 *et seq.*; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 20-25.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 220.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 220; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 23.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 220, referring to: Hern\u00e1ndez I (**CER-3**), \u00b6 41; Bullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6 83.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6\u00b6 113, 116 (citing Tax Code (**CA-14**), Articles 109, 110, 127, 150).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 220; Bravo-Pic\u00f3n I (**RER-3**), \u00b6 61; Tax Code, Supreme Decree No. 133-2013-EF dated 22 June 2013 (**CA-14**), Article 115(a), (c); Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 25.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 220.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 220.\n\n486.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that the Claimant is using a court decision or proceedings to toll the limitations period.504 Firstly, the Claimant does not argue that the administrative review process before SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal \"*tolled*\u201d the limitation period but argues that the limitation period only starts to run when each Assessment became final and enforceable. Secondly, the Claimant asserts that neither SUNAT nor the Tax Tribunal are \"*courts*\u201d but administrative agencies of the MEF.505\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 24.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 221.\n\n487.\n\nThe Claimant further disputes the Respondent's statement that if the limitation period commences only when assessments become final and enforceable against SMCV, \"*any claimant with genuinely untimely claims could overcome the limitations period by filing a challenge before a local administrative body or court and then waiting until the very last minute before filing its Notice of Arbitration to withdraw that challenge*.\u201d506 The Claimant notes that any claims already time-barred by the three-year limitation period under Article 10.18.1 of the TPA would also be time-barred under the far shorter periods for challenging assessments under the Peruvian Tax Code (*i.e*., 20 working days for filing challenges before SUNAT and 15 working days for filing challenges before the Tax Tribunal), meaning that a claimant with \"*untimely claims*\u201d could not make them timely by commencing administrative review proceedings.507\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 222; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 432.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 222.\n\n488.\n\nThird, the Claimant submits that each final and enforceable Royalty or Tax Assessment gave rise to a separate breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement.508 The Claimant states that the wording of Article 10.18.1 of the TPA refers to the limitation period for a \"*claim*\u201d and not for \"*a series of similar or related*\u201d claims. Moreover, Article 10.18.1 of the TPA requires knowledge of breach and loss or damages that has been incurred and not breach and loss or damages that might occur in the future.509 The Claimant also states that under Peruvian law, each Assessment is a separate administrative act that, once it becomes final and enforceable, creates a separate cause of action for breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement.510 In particular, (i) SMCV was required to self-assess taxes independently for each fiscal period, (ii) Article 77 of the Tax Code required SMCV to file administrative challenges for each Assessment with SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal, (iii) none of SUNAT's or the Tax Tribunal's resolutions had any binding or precedential effect dictating the results of future assessments or resolutions, and (iv) even after SUNAT notified SMCV of the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments, the Government continued to confirm that the Concentrator was stabilized and that SMCV would have a very strong argument for prevailing before the Tax Tribunal.511 In addition, the Claimant argues that it could not have acquired knowledge of the loss or damage resulting from any of the Respondent's breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement until each of the Assessments became final and enforceable, as before that moment it did not yet incur any losses nor could it predict any future losses.512\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 223; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 26 *et seq*.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 225; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 28.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 226; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 29.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 226; Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6\u00b6 80-81.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 227; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 31.\n\n489.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant argues that a number of investment treaty authorities have consistently recognized that separate limitation periods apply to independent causes of action even when those causes of action result from a \"*series of similar or related actions by a respondent state.*\u201d513 The Claimant relies on the conclusions reached *inter alia* by the *Eli Lilly v. Canada*, *Nissan v. India*, *Bilcon/Clayton v. Canada*, and *Grand River v. United States* tribunals.514 Moreover, the Claimant states that, contrary to the claimants in the cases on which the Respondent relies, it has not alleged continuing or composite breaches in an attempt to hold Peru liable for Government actions that occurred before the cut-off date. Rather, the Claimant alleges independent breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement based on independent causes of action arising after the cut-off date from each final and enforceable Assessment.515 The Claimant states that the Tribunal must assess the timeliness of the Claimant's claims by reference to the actual \"*breach[es] alleged*\u201d in the Claimant's pleadings.516 The Claimant concludes that the Respondent's own authorities (*e.g*., *Infinito Gold v. Costa Rica, Resolute Forest v. Canada, Spence v. Costa Rica*, *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, and *Apotex v.

The Claimant disputes the Respondent's argument that claims under Article 10.5 of the TPA are time-barred because they are based on a \"*series of similar or related actions by a respondent state*\u201d and that the Claimant should have thus acquired knowledge of the breach by 15 September 2009 at the latest. The Claimant submits that the Respondent's objections fail on the same grounds as the Respondent's time-bar objection to the Claimant's Stability Agreement claims.520 According to the Claimant, the standard for determining when causes of action for breach of the TPA arose is the same as that for determining when a cause of action for breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement arose.521 The Claimant argues that authorities such as the *Mobil v. Canada (II)* tribunal confirm that a government decision does not give rise to a cause of action for a breach of an investment treaty until it is final and enforceable.522 According to the Claimant, the 2009, 2010-2011, Q4 2011, 2012, and 2013 Royalty Assessments each gave rise to an independent cause of action for breach of Article 10.5 of the TPA, with a separate limitation period.523\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 231.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 232; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 234; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 36.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 233, referring to: *Mobil v.

The Claimant argues that SMCV cannot be faulted for the Respondent's own lack of transparency and that Freeport and SMCV exercised reasonable diligence when looking into the perceived procedural irregularities.527\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 235.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 236; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 40.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 236; SMCV, Request for Access to Information dated 10 February 2021 (**CE-1092**); SMCV, Request for Access to Information dated 5 March 2021 (**CE-1094**); Email from the MEF Document Management and User Services Office to Adriana Lucia Ch\u00e1vez \u00c1lvarez dated 24 February 2021, 2:55 PM PET (**CE-1093**); Email from \u00darsula Villanueva Arias to Zoraida Alicia Olano Silva dated 22 March 2013, 4:02 PM PET (**CE-648**); Email from Zoraida Alicia Olano Silva to Carlos Hugo Moreano Valdivia dated 21 May 2013, 10:47 AM PET (**CE-651**); Email from Carlos Hugo Moreano Valdivia to Zoraida Alicia Olano Silva dated 22 May 2013 8:58 AM PET (**CE-652**); Email from Carlos Hugo Moreano Valdivia to Zoraida Alicia Olano Silva dated 21 May 2013, 10:05 AM PET (**CE-650**); Email from Licette Isabel Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Dulanto to Zoraida Alicia Olano Silva dated 22 May 2013, 9:55 AM PET (**CE-653**); Email from Luis Gabriel Cayo Quispe to Zoraida Alicia Olano Silva and Licette Isabel Zu\u00f1iga Dulanto dated 24 May 2013, 8:31 AM PET (**CE-654**); Email from Zoraida Alicia Olano Silva to Luis Gabriel Cayo Quispe and Licette Isabel Zu\u00f1iga Dulanto dated 24 May 2013, 10:23 AM PET (**CE-655**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 237; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 39 *et seq.*\n\n493.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's claims based on the Respondent's failure to waive penalties and interest, the Claimant argues that each of the Respondent's breaches of Article 10.5 of the TPA occurred after 28 February 2017.528\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 238.\n\n494.\n\nWith respect to the failure to waive penalties and interest on the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Assessments, the Claimant explains that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the TPA: (i) on 21 July 2017 when the Appellate Court notified SMCV of its decision arbitrarily and unreasonably refusing to consider *de novo* SMCV's entitlement to a waiver of penalties and interest on the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments, and (ii) on 10 October 2017 when the Supreme Court notified SMCV of its decision arbitrarily and unreasonably refusing to consider *de novo* SMCV's entitlement to a waiver of penalties and interest on the 2008 Royalty Assessments.529 The Claimant argues that the Contentious Administrative Courts were required to consider SMCV's entitlement to the waiver *de novo* and their arbitrary failure to do so resulted in \"*self-standing*\u201d breaches that occurred once those decisions were notified to SMCV.530\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 43.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 239.\n\n495.\n\nWith respect to the failure to waive penalties and interest on the 2009, 2010-11, Q4 2011, 2012, 2013 Royalty Assessments and the Tax Assessments, the Claimant argues that Peru's breaches for failure to waive penalties and interest on the remaining Assessments occurred when each Assessment of penalties and interest became final and enforceable. The Claimant states that all of the Assessments, including the assessments of penalties and interest, were distinct Government actions that became final and enforceable pursuant to the applicable administrative process. The Claimant submits that no obligation to pay existed before the Assessments became final and enforceable, nor was there any knowledge or existence of a loss before this time.531\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 240; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 45.\n\n496.\n\nFinally, the Claimant states that the Parties agree that Freeport's claims for breach of Article 10.5 of the TPA based on Peru's failure to reimburse SMCV for Q4 2012 to Q4 2013 GEM payments are timely because Peru's denial of SMCV's GEM reimbursement request occurred on 22 March 2019.532\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 241; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 46.\n\n**3. The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n497.\n\nThe NDP submits that because the claimant bears the burden of proof with respect to the factual elements necessary to establish jurisdiction under Chapter Ten of the TPA, including with respect to Article 10.18.1, a claimant must prove the necessary and relevant facts to establish that each of its claims falls within the three-year limitations period.533\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 8.\n\n498.\n\nIn addition, according to the NDP, the limitations period has been described as a \"*clear and rigid*\u201d requirement that is not subject to any \"*suspension*, *prolongation*, *or other qualification*.\u201d534 An investor first acquires knowledge of an alleged breach and loss under Article 10.18.1 of the TPA as of a particular \"*date*.\u201d Such knowledge cannot first be acquired at multiple points in time or on a recurring basis and subsequent transgressions by a party arising from a continuing course of conduct do not renew the limitations period once an investor knows, or should have known, of the alleged breach and loss or damage incurred thereby.535 Accordingly, where a \"*series of similar and related actions by a respondent state*\u201d is at issue, a claimant cannot evade the limitations period by basing its claim on \"*the most recent transgression*\u201d in that series.536\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 9.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 9.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 10.\n\n499.\n\nIn addition, with respect to knowledge of \"*incurred loss or damage,*\u201d the NDP submits that under Article 10.18.1 of the TPA, a claimant may have knowledge of loss or damage even if the amount or extent of that loss or damage cannot be precisely quantified until some future date.537\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 11.\n\n500.\n\nFor purposes of assessing what a claimant should have known, the NDP agrees with the reasoning of the *Grand River v. United States* tribunal, which held that \"*a fact is imputed to [sic] person if by exercise of reasonable care or diligence, the person would have known of that fact*.\u201d538 The NDP further agrees that it is appropriate to \"*consider in this connection what a reasonably prudent investor should have done in connection with extensive investments and efforts such as those described to the Tribunal*.\u201d539 Relying on the findings of the *Berkowitz v. Costa Rica* tribunal, the NDP submits that \"[t]*he 'should have first acquired knowledge' test* [\u2026] *is an objective standard; what a prudent claimant should have known or must reasonably be deemed to have known*.\u201d540\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\nNon-Disputing Party Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\n**4. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n501.\n\nArticle 10.18.1 of the TPA sets a time limit for claims to be brought to investor-state arbitration under Articles 10.16.1(a) and 10.16.1(b). Specifically, Article 10.18.1 of the TPA provides:\n\n*No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach alleged under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has incurred loss or damage.*541\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.18.1.\n\n502.\n\nBased on the wording of Article 10.18.1 of the TPA, the Tribunal's task is to (i) identify the cut-off date for the three-year limitations period, (ii) determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known of the alleged breach or breaches before that cut-off date, and (iii) determine whether the Claimant or SMCV knew or should have known that it had incurred loss or damage before that same date.\n\n**a) The cut-off date**\n-----------------------\n\n503.\n\nWith respect to the cut-off date, the Claimant's Notice of Arbitration was filed on 28 February 2020. The cut-off date is thus 28 February 2017. The Parties agree with this cut-off date.542\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 412; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 211.\n\n**b) Knowledge of breach and loss**\n-----------------------------------\n\n504.\n\nThe Parties have distinguished the time-bar issue between the claims based on the alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement and those based on the alleged breaches of the TPA. The Tribunal will thus address each of these allegations in turn.\n\n**aa) Knowledge of breach and loss in relation to the 1998 Stability Agreement claims**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n505.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted claims alleging breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement for (i) the 2009, 2010-2011, Q4 2011, 2012, and 2013 Royalty Assessments, (ii) the Income Tax Assessments for 2006 to 2013, (iii) the Additional Income Tax Assessments for 2007 to 2013, (iv) the General Sales Tax Assessments (including those on Non-Residents) for 2005 to 2011, (v) the Temporary Tax on Net Assets Assessments for 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2013, (vi) the Q4 2011-2012 and 2013 Special Mining Tax Assessments, and (vii) the 2013 Complementary Mining Pension Fund Assessments.543 The Claimant does not submit claims for the Respondent's alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement arising from the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Assessments \"*because those claims fall outside the three-year prescription period*.\u201d544\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 353.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 355.\n\n506.\n\nTherefore, the question that arises is whether the Respondent's alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement constitute a single breach with a single limitation period as argued by the Respondent,545 or 36 separate alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement and as many different limitation periods as argued by the Claimant.546\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 700.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 28.\n\n507.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal finds that the different assessments allegedly breaching the 1998 Stability Agreement constitute separate measures and separate causes of action with distinct limitation periods. This is because should the Claimant's claims be founded, SUNAT's Assessments would each individually breach the 1998 Stability Agreement as instantaneous breaches rather than continuing breaches. This finding does not \"*render the limitations provisions ineffective*\u201d in the words of the *Grand River v. United States* tribunal because the Claimant is not permitted to bring forward claims for which the time-bar has elapsed, such as for example the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Assessments.547 Rather, the time bar remains effective for each and every breach for which knowledge and loss pre-date the entry into force of the Treaty.\n\n*Grand River v. USA*, Decision on Jurisdiction (**RA-4**), \u00b6 81.\n\n508.\n\nThe fact that SUNAT's Assessments were all based on the same legal instrument, the 1998 Stability Agreement, and adopted in light of the same legal provisions in the Mining Law and Regulations, does not alter the Tribunal's conclusion. As a matter of fact, and although it is not necessarily relevant for the purposes of interpretation of the TPA, the Tribunal notes that separate limitation periods applied for the challenge of SUNAT's Assessments under Peruvian law because such Assessments all constituted different causes of action.548 Accordingly, although the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments were also based on the 1998 Stability Agreement and in light of the same legal provisions in the Mining Law and Regulations as the subsequent SUNAT Assessments, the Tribunal cannot accept that knowledge of breach or loss was acquired only once and in relation to the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments. Rather, the Tribunal finds that there are as many limitation periods as there are alleged breaches.\n\nTax Code (**CA-14**), Articles 137(2), 146.\n\n509.\n\nThe Tribunal's second enquiry concerns knowledge of breach or loss. For the Claimant's claims to be time-barred, Article 10.18.1 of the TPA requires the Claimant to have actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged breach and that the Claimant or SMCV had knowledge that loss or damage was incurred prior to the cut-off date.549 These requirements are cumulative. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the observation of the tribunal in *Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic* that \"*knowledge of the breach in and of itself is insufficient to trigger the limitation period's running*.\u201d550 This means that as long as either knowledge of breach or knowledge of loss post-date the cut-off date, the Claimant's claims would be timely.\n\nTPA (**CA-10**)*,* Article 10.18.1.\n\n*Corona Materials v. Dominican Republic*, Award on Preliminary Objections (**RA-3**), \u00b6 194*.*\n\n510.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Tribunal finds that by assessing knowledge of loss or damage (without the need of assessing knowledge of breach), the Claimant has shown to the satisfaction of the Tribunal that the Claimant's claims have been submitted within the limitations period.\n\n511.\n\nThe wording of the TPA clearly requires a claimant to have \"*incurred loss or damage*\u201d in the past tense. The Tribunal has taken note of the case law cited in support of the Parties' arguments, including *Grand River v. United States*, *Spence v. Costa Rica*, and *Mondev v. United States* according to which the limitation clause does not require full or precise knowledge of loss or damage.551 However, in the Tribunal's view, this case does not hinge on the Claimant's or SMCV's full or precise knowledge of loss or damage but on the certainty that damage *has been incurred*. The Tribunal finds that no loss or damage was incurred until the disputed assessments became final. This is because until then, they could still be corrected at the administrative level. This finding does not contradict the findings in *Apotex v. United States* and *Mondev v. United States*, according to which a claimant cannot use a court decision or subsequent court proceeding to toll the limitation period.552 Here, the Claimant did not use a court decision or subsequent court proceedings to toll the limitation period. The Claimant rather used all legitimate administrative means of review in Peru before it resorted to bringing a TPA claim. Deciding otherwise would result in claimants prematurely filing claims before investment arbitration tribunals under the TPA before any corrective domestic administrative review can take place.\n\n*Grand River v. USA*, Decision on Jurisdiction (**RA-4**), \u00b6 77; *Spence v. Costa Rica*, Interim Award (**RA-2**), \u00b6 213; *Mondev v. USA*, Award (**RA-6**), \u00b6 87.\n\n*Mondev v. USA*, Award (**RA-6**), \u00b6 87; *Apotex v. USA*, Award on Jurisdiction (**RA-7**), \u00b6 331.\n\n**bb) Knowledge of breach and loss in relation to the alleged TPA breaches**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n512.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to knowledge of breach and loss in relation to the alleged TPA violations.\n\n**1. The Claimant's Article 10.5 claims based on the alleged breach of legitimate expectations, arbitrary actions, inconsistent and non-transparent actions, and lack of due process**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n513.\n\nFirst, the Claimant has alleged that the 2009, 2010-2011, Q4 2011, 2012, and 2013 Royalty Assessments breached the Respondent's obligations under Article 10.5 of the TPA to refrain from frustrating the Claimant's and SMCV's legitimate expectations, engaging in arbitrary, inconsistent, and non-transparent actions, and violating SMCV's due process rights on the dates upon which each assessment became final and enforceable.553\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 231.\n\n514.\n\nThe Tribunal has already found above that claims for breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement based on the 2009, 2010-2011, Q4 2011, 2012, and 2013 Royalty Assessments were not time-barred. Accordingly, the Tribunal also rejects the Respondent's argument in relation to the time-bar as applied to the alleged TPA breaches for the same reasons.\n\n**2. The Claimant's Article 10.5 claims based on alleged due process violations**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n515.\n\nSecond, the Claimant has alleged that there were due process violations in the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases as well as in the 2009, 2010-2011, and Q4 2011 Royalty Cases.\n\n516.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent does not dispute that the due process claims based on the 2009, 2010-2011 and Q4 2011 Royalty Cases are timely.554\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 454.\n\n517.\n\nHowever, the Parties disagree as to the timeliness of the claims based on the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases. The Tribunal will thus turn to each of the Claimant's allegations in relation to the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases in turn:\n\n1) (*Due Process Claim 1*) The Claimant claims that the President of the Tax Tribunal, Ms. Olano, who should have no role in the decision making of the chambers of the Tax Tribunal, interfered to resolve SMCV's challenges by improperly tasking her assistant, Ms. Villanueva, with drafting the resolution in the 2008 Royalty Case.\n\n2) (*Due Process Claim 2*) The Claimant claims that President Olano intervened in the resolution of the 2006-2007 Royalty Case by ensuring that the 2008 Royalty Case, which was filed nine months after the 2006-2007 Royalty Case, would \"*proceed[] on a fast track*\u201d and would be issued first.\n\n3) (*Due Process Claim 3*) The Claimant argues that by adopting a nearly identical resolution to the 2008 Royalty Case in the 2006-2007 Royalty Case, Chamber 10 \"*abdicated [its] duty to independently deliberate in the challenge to the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments*.\u201d555\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 390-392; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 165-168.\n\n518.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, while SMCV received the decisions of the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases in 2013, SMCV and the Claimant only became aware of the full extent of the alleged due process violations in 2021, as a result of a request for access to public information.556 In contrast, the Respondent argues that the procedural irregularities appear on the face of the decisions, meaning that SMCV should have first known about them when it first received them.557\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 236.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 453.\n\n519.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant's Due Process Claims 1 and 2 are not time-barred. This is because, as the Claimant has argued, the evidence on which the Claimant relies to make its claims was only made available to SMCV through its freedom of information request in 2021.558\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 389 *et seq.*\n\n520.\n\nWith respect to Due Process Claim 3, the Tribunal acknowledges that SMCV necessarily acquired knowledge of the fact that the resolutions in the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases were \"*nearly identical*\u201d as soon as the decisions were rendered in 2013.559 However, also in this regard, the Tribunal cannot exclude that the full evidence on which the Claimant relies to make its claim was only made available to SMCV through its freedom of information request in 2021. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant's Due Process Claim 3 is not time-barred, either.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 168.\n\n**3. The Claimant's Article 10.5 claims based on the Respondent's alleged failure to waive penalties and interest**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n521.\n\nThird, the Claimant has alleged that the Respondent failed to waive penalties and interest in breach of Article 10.5 of the TPA.\n\n522.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant makes three claims:\n\n1) (*Failure to Waive Claim 1*) The Claimant argues that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the TPA when the Supreme Court notified SMCV of its decision refusing to consider *de novo* SMCV's alleged entitlement to a waiver of penalties and interest on the 2008 Royalty Assessments.\n\n2) (*Failure to Waive Claim 2*) The Claimant argues that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the TPA when the Appellate Court notified SMCV of its decision refusing to consider *de novo* SMCV's entitlement to a waiver of penalties and interest on the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments.\n\n3) (*Failure to Waive Claim 3*) The Claimant argues that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the TPA when each of the 2009, 2010-2011, Q4 2011, 2012 and 2013 assessments of penalties and interest on Royalty and Tax Assessments became final and enforceable.560\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 238-240.\n\n523.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's Failure to Waive Claims 1 and 2, the Tribunal notes the Respondent's submission that the Claimant's true complaint underlying its claims is SUNAT's imposition of penalties and interest against SMCV in the first place. The Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent's characterization of the Claimant's claim. The Claimant has framed its claims as claims made against judicial acts, which constitutes a different cause of action as a claim made against the SUNAT Assessments. The Supreme Court notified SMCV of its decision refusing to consider *de novo* SMCV's alleged entitlement to a waiver of penalties and interest on the 2008 Royalty Assessments on 10 October 2017. The Appellate Court notified SMCV of its decision refusing to consider *de novo* SMCV's entitlement to a waiver of penalties and interest on the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments on 21 July 2017. Both dates post-date the cut-off date and the Claimant's Failure to Waive Claims 1 and 2 are accordingly not time-barred.\n\n524.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's Failure to Waive Claim 3, the Tribunal equally rejects the Respondent's objection for the same reasons as held above (see above paras. 507 *et seq*.). This is because SMCV only acquired knowledge of loss or damage at the end of the administrative process, when the loss or damage was certain.\n\n**4. The Claimant's Article 10.5 claims based on the Respondent's alleged failure to reimburse GEM payments**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n525.\n\nWith regard to the Claimant's claims for breach of Article 10.5 of the TPA based on the Respondent's alleged failure to reimburse SMCV for Q4 2011 to Q3 2012 GEM payments, the Parties agree to the timeliness.561\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 266; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 46; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 769.\n\n**B. The Respondent's claim that the penalties and interest on assessed taxes fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction because they constitute \"*****taxation measures*****\u201d under Article 22.3.1 of the TPA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n526.\n\nThe Respondent argues that penalties and interest imposed on SMCV for its failure to pay taxes assessed in SUNAT's Tax Assessments constitute taxation measures, which are excluded from the scope of Article 10.5 of the TPA under Article 22.3.1 of the TPA.562 Thus, the Tribunal may not exercise jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims related to those penalties and interest.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 446, 456-458, 490, fn. 904; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 770 *et seq.*; Respondent's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 30 *et seq*.; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 285 *et seq.*\n\n527.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the TPA defines \"*measure*\u201d broadly, to include \"*any law, regulation, procedure, requirement, or practice.*\u201d563 Had the parties to the TPA intended \"*taxation measures*\u201d to be limited solely to \"*taxes*,\u201d as the Claimant suggests, Article 22.3.1 of the TPA would only have carved-out \"*taxes*\u201d from the investment chapter rather than \"*taxation measures*.\u201d564\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 772; TPA (**CA-10**), Article 1.3.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 775.\n\n528.\n\nIn support of its position, the Respondent submits that previous tribunals have also adopted a broad interpretation of \"*taxation measures*\u201d and that such term should be interpreted as including more than just the taxes themselves. For example, the *Canfor v. United States* tribunal interpreted \"*taxation measures*\u201d in NAFTA's Article 2103.1 (which is identical to TPA's Article 22.3.1), as being \"*broader than 'law'.*\u201d565 The *Link Trading v. Moldova* tribunal considered the term \"*taxation*\u201d under the applicable treaty \"*broad enough to cover customs duties and other forms of raising revenue that are within the State's power*.\u201d566\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 772, referring to: *Canfor Corporation et al. v. United States of America*, UNCITRAL, Decision on Preliminary Question dated 6 June 2006 (**RA-9**), \u00b6 258.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 772, referring to: *Link Trading v.

SUNAT's refusal to waive these penalties and interest constitutes likewise a practice or procedure related to taxation. That refusal therefore also qualifies as a taxation measure under Article 22.3.1 of the TPA.568\n\nRespondent's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6 31.\n\nRespondent's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6 32.\n\n530.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant agrees that the Tribunal should \"*look to Peruvian law to determine whether a Government measure constitutes 'taxation.'*\u201d569 In this respect, the Respondent submits that Peruvian Laws No. 30506 and 30230 recognize that the application of penalties and interest are taxation measures, as they are part of the government's administration of taxes. Specifically, Peruvian Law No. 30506 provides that the regulation of tax-related penalties and interest is a part of the Executive Branch's powers and duties in administering taxes,570 while Law No. 30230 provides that the procedures in the determination of tax debts subject to adjustment (due to inflation) includes the assessment of the corresponding interest.571 Also according to the Respondent's tax experts, penalties and interest related to tax assessments are considered \"*tax debt*\u201d under Peruvian law, and therefore any measure related to the assessment (calculation), extinction and reprograming of tax-related penalties and572 interest is a taxation measure.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 773; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 272.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 773; Law Delegating to the Executive Branch the Power to Legislate on Matters of Economic Reactivation and Formalization, Citizen Security, Fight Against Corruption, Water and Sanitation and Reorganization of Petroper\u00fa S.A., Law No. 30506 dated 6 October 2016 (published on 9 October 2016) (**RE-327**), Article 2(1)(a)(5).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 773; Law Establishing Tax Measures, Simplification of Procedures, and Permits for Promoting and Revitalizing Investment in the Country, Law No. 30230 dated 12 July 2014 (**CA-209**), Articles 4.1-4.3.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 774; Bravo-Pic\u00f3n II (**RER-8**), \u00b6\u00b6 258-260.\n\n531.\n\nFinally, the Respondent comments on the Claimant's reliance on allegedly opposing case law, such as the *Nissan v.

The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n532.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Article 22.3.1 of the TPA does not apply to penalties and interest on the Tax Assessments.574 The Claimant explains that Article 22.3.1 of the TPA applies only to measures that constitute \"*taxation*,\u201d *i.e.,* measures that impose tax obligations. The Claimant states that the Respondent's objection is based on the fundamentally flawed premise that \"*taxation measures*\u201d encompasses more than just \"*taxes*.\u201d575\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 271 *et seq.*; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 77 *et seq.*; Claimant's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 24 *et seq.*; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 117 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 78.\n\n533.\n\nThe Claimant agrees that the Tribunal must look to Peruvian law to determine whether a Government measure constitutes \"*taxation*\u201d since this term is not defined in the TPA.576 According to the Claimant, Peruvian law defines a tax as a \"*monetary obligation, set out in law, which does not constitute a penalty for an unlawful action [\u2026] that must be paid by the person that is in the situation determined by the law*.\u201d577 The Claimant lists three categories of obligations falling within that definition: (i) taxes (*impuestos*), which are \"*monetary obligations triggered by a specific set of circumstances determined by the State [\u2026] based on the taxpayer's economic capacity*;\u201d (ii) contributions, which are \"*monetary obligations triggered by the benefits a taxpayer receives from public works or services*;\u201d and (iii) fees, which are \"*monetary obligations triggered by a public service the State provides the taxpayer or by a permit the State issues to the taxpayer*.\u201d578\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 272.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 272; Hern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6 132; Geraldo Ataliba, *Tax Incidence Hypothesis* (1987) (**CA-354**), \u00b6 9.9; Constitutional Court Decision, Case No. 3303-2003-AA/TC dated 28 June 2004 (**CA-378**), p. 3; Tax Tribunal Resolution No. 889-5-2000 dated 27 October 2000 (**CA-365**), p. 4.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 272; Hern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6 133.\n\n534.\n\nRelying on decisions of the Constitutional Court and the Tax Tribunal, the Claimant argues that neither penalties nor interest on tax assessments constitute taxation under Peruvian law. Specifically, the Peruvian law definition of taxes expressly excludes penalties and, accordingly, penalties are not classified as one of the three categories of taxes in the Tax Code.579 The Tax Tribunal also recognized that penalties and taxes are independent obligations arising from \"*administrative acts of a different nature, intent, content, purpose and legal consequence*\u201d and that, unlike taxes, penalties serve a punitive purpose.580 The purpose of penalties is not to \"*fund the provision of public goods and services and help redistribute wealth*\u201d but \"*to punish taxpayers that break tax regulations and deter future violations*.\u201d581\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 273; Hern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6\u00b6 132, 136; Constitutional Court Decision, Case No. 3303-2003-AA/TC dated 28 June 2004 (**CA-378**), p. 3; Tax Tribunal Resolution No. 889-5-2000 dated 27 October 2000 (**CA-365**), p. 4; Tax Tribunal Resolution No. 04170-1-2011 dated 16 March 2011 (**CA-394**), p. 4.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 273; Hern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6\u00b6 136-137; Tax Tribunal Resolution No. 04170-1-2011 dated 16 March 2011 (**CA-394**), pp. 4-5.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 273; Hern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6\u00b6 130, 135, 139; Ram\u00f3n Vald\u00e9s Costa, *Tax Lawcourse* dated 1996 (**CA-361**), p. 77.\n\n535.\n\nThe Claimant submits that interest is also not a \"*taxation measure,*\u201d because (i) interest is not classified as one of the three categories of taxes of the Tax Code and is an obligation separate and independent from a tax assessment, and (ii) unlike taxes, the purpose of interest is to \"*compensate the Government for the loss of the use of money as a result of the taxpayer's default*.\u201d582\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 273, referring to: Hern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6 140; Peruvian Civil Code, Legislative Decree No. 295 dated 24 July 1984 (**CA-39**), Article 1242; Silvia N\u00fa\u00f1ez Riva, *When to Pay Tax Moratory Interest?*, 43 LAW AND SOCIETY dated 2014 (**CA-402**), p. 231; Constitutional Court Decision, Case No. 02169-2016-PA/TC dated 19 April 2022 (**CA-429**), p. 11; Constitutional Court Decision, Case No. 2036-2021-PA/TC dated 7 December 2021 (**CA-428**), p. 26; Constitutional Court Decision, Case No. 05289-2016-PA/TC dated 11 November 2021 (**CA-427**), p. 19; Constitutional Court Decision, Case No. 04532-2013-PA/TC dated 16 August 2018 (**CE-189**), p. 7.\n\n536.\n\nIn response to the argument made by the Respondent's experts that penalties and interest are taxation measures because they are identified as \"*components of tax debt*\u201d under the Tax Code, the Claimant and its taw law expert submit that the term \"*tax debt*\u201d encompasses a \"*broad range*\u201d of concepts that the Tax Code bundles together purely for purposes of procedural and administrative convenience because they are each administered by the Tax Administration and are subject to \"*similar procedures for their administration, payment, collection, and challenge,*\u201d even though they are not taxes.583 The Claimant also notes that the Respondent does not deny that the decisions of the Tax Tribunal and the Constitutional Court clearly show that Peruvian law does not characterize penalties and interest as taxes and expressly excludes penalties from the definition of taxes.584\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 81; Hern\u00e1ndez III (**CER-13**), \u00b6 17.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 81.\n\n537.\n\nThe Claimant further relies on the findings of other tribunals, such as in *Nissan v.

The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n538.\n\nThe NDP submits that Article 22.3.1 of the TPA generally excludes taxation measures from the TPA's provisions.587 Article 22.3 of the TPA includes, however, several exceptions to this general exclusion. Taxation measures are not subject to any Chapter Ten obligations, including those embodied in Article 10.5, that are not expressly identified as exceptions to the Article 22.3.1 general exclusion of taxation measures from the TPA.588\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 31 *et seq.*\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 31.\n\n539.\n\nThe NDP submits that Article 22.3.1 of the TPA applies to all \"*taxation measures*.\u201d A \"*measure*\u201d is defined broadly in Article 1.3 to include \"*any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice*.\u201d Any \"*practice*\u201d related to \"*taxation*\u201d is therefore addressed by Article 22.3.1. A \"*practice*\u201d in this context includes not only the application of, or failure to apply a tax, but also the enforcement or failure to enforce a tax.589\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 32.\n\n**4. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n540.\n\nThe issue for the Tribunal to determine is whether Article 22.3.1 of the TPA bars the Claimant's TPA Article 10.5 claims for the Respondent's alleged failure to waive penalties and interest on the Tax Assessments. In what follows, the Tribunal sets out its analysis of this issue and reaches by majority the conclusion that the disputed penalties and interest on the Tax Assessments fall outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n541.\n\nArticle 22.3.1 of the TPA provides:\n\n*Except as set out in this Article, nothing in this Agreement shall apply to taxation* 590 *measures.*\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 22.3.1.\n\n542.\n\nWith regard to the \"*[e]xcept as set out in this Article*\u201d exemption, the Tribunal notes that Article 22.3 of the TPA provides for a number of exceptions to the carve-out of taxation measures from the scope of application of the TPA. However, Article 22.3 of the TPA does not carve out the obligations embodied in Article 10.5 of the TPA. Accordingly, none of the exceptions to the carve-out of taxation measures apply in this case.\n\n543.\n\nAs to the question of whether the imposition of penalties and interest on the Tax Assessments (or the failure to waive them) constitute \"*taxation measures*\u201d under the TPA, the Tribunal finds that SUNAT's imposition of penalties and interest on the Tax Assessments cannot be treated differently than SUNAT's failure to waive such penalties and interest for the purposes of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. Finding otherwise would lead to the situation in which claimants could still bring precluded \"*taxation measures*\u201d (e.g. a tax assessment) before tribunals under the TPA simply by arguing that the State has failed to waive them.\n\n544.\n\nTurning to the notion of \"*taxation measure*\u201d under the TPA, the Tribunal notes that the term is not defined in the TPA. The Claimant argues that because the TPA does not define \"*taxation measures*\u201d, the Tribunal \"*must look to Peruvian law to determine whether a Government measure constitutes 'taxation.'*\u201d591 The Tribunal disagrees. The TPA is an international treaty and the meaning of \"*taxation measure*\u201d is, thus, a matter for treaty interpretation that is subject to the general principles of interpretation of the VCLT. This exercise is a matter of international law, although domestic law may play a role as a matter of fact. The fact that domestic law treats or does not treat certain measures as taxes or taxation measures is not dispositive of whether this constitutes a \"*taxation measure*\u201d under the Treaty. The Claimant's expert Mr. Hern\u00e1ndez has opined on the issue of whether penalties and interest are taxes under Peruvian law but has specifically stated that he does \"*not attempt to interpret this Treaty term as a matter of international law*.\u201d592 The Tribunal accordingly considers his expert testimony to be inconclusive for the interpretation of the TPA.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 272.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6 129.\n\n545.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the ordinary meaning of \"*taxation measure*\u201d in the context of the TPA and in light of its object and purpose, in accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT.\n\n546.\n\nArticle 1.3 of the TPA broadly defines the term \"*measure*\u201d as \"*any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice*.\u201d593 Any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice related to \"*taxation*\u201d is addressed by Article 22.3.1 of the TPA.\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 1.3.\n\n547.\n\nTurning to the term \"*taxation*\u201d, the Tribunal notes that the TPA refers to both \"*taxes*\u201d and \"*taxation measures.*\u201d594 Those terms must accordingly refer to different concepts. Moreover, in the Tribunal's view, the word \"*taxation*\u201d refers to a broader notion than the term \"*tax*\u201d. The Tribunal notes in this regard that the *Link Trading v. Moldova* tribunal considered the term \"*taxation*\u201d under the applicable treaty \"*broad enough to cover customs duties and other forms of raising revenue that are within the State's power*.\u201d595 Other investment tribunals also share the understanding that the term \"*taxation measure*\u201d is broad.596\n\nSee for example: TPA (**CA-10**), Article 22.5.\n\n*Link-Trading v. Department for Customs Control of Republic of Moldova*, Award on Jurisdiction dated 16 February 2001 (**RA-101**), p. 9.\n\n*Canfor v. USA*, Decision on Preliminary Question (**RA-9**), \u00b6 258 (in which the tribunal found that a \"*'measure' is [\u2026] broader than 'law.'*\u201d).\n\n548.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that \"*taxation measures*\u201d include measures that are part of the regime for the imposition and enforcement of a tax. The Tribunal finds that the application of, or failure to apply a tax, as well as the enforcement or failure to enforce a tax constitute \"*practice(s)*\u201d related to \"*taxation*.\u201d In this regard, the Tribunal notes that both the United States and Peru, *i.e.,* the Treaty Parties, have expressed agreement with this position in this proceeding.597\n\nRespondent's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6 31; NDP Submission, \u00b6 32.\n\n549.\n\nArticle 22.3.4 of the TPA also provides useful context to the issue of whether tax enforcement measures, such as penalties and interest, constitute \"*taxation measures*.\u201d Article 22.3.4 of the TPA sets out a number of exclusions to the taxation measures exception of Article 22.3.1 of the TPA. It specifically provides that a number of provisions of the Treaty relating to national treatment and most-favored nation treatment are excluded from the principle in Article 22.3.1 of the TPA and shall thus apply to taxation measures.598 As an exception, Article 22.3.4(g), in turn, provides that this exclusion shall not apply \"*to the adoption or enforcement of any taxation measure aimed at ensuring the equitable or effective imposition or collection of taxes [\u2026]*.\u201d599 The Tribunal finds that this wording confirms that the Treaty parties did not intend the Treaty to apply to the enforcement of taxation measures.\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 22.3.4.\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 22.3.4(g).\n\n550.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal turns to the object and purpose of the Treaty. The object and purpose of the Treaty is *inter alia* to \"*promote regional economic integration*\u201d between the TPA parties, \"*establish clear and mutually advantageous rules governing their trade*\u201d, \"*ensure a predictable legal and commercial framework for business and investment*\u201d, as well as \"*preserve their ability to safeguard the public welfare*.\u201d600 The purpose of Chapter Twenty-Two is to preserve the States' sovereign power in matters of legitimate regulatory interest to States. With respect to Article 22.3 of the TPA in particular, the Tribunal agrees with the *Murphy v. Ecuador* tribunal's finding, which considered that the purpose of the tax carve-out in the underlying treaty is to \"*preserve the States' sovereignty in relation to their power to impose taxes in their territory*.\u201d601 The *Murphy v. Ecuador* tribunal accordingly considered that \"*it is necessary for the Tribunal to examine whether that measure comes within the State's domestic tax regime*.\u201d602.\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Preamble.\n\n*Murphy Exploration & Production Company - International v.

While the Respondent's experts Mr. Bravo and Mr. Pic\u00f3n agree that penalties and interest are not taxes under Peruvian law, they testify that penalties and interest nevertheless constitute \"*tax measures*\u201d:603\n\n\u2013 Law No. 30506 provides that the regulation of tax-related penalties and interest is a part of the Executive Branch's powers and duties in administering taxes;604\n\n\u2013 Law No. 30230 provides that the procedure in the determination of tax debts subject to adjustment includes the assessment of the corresponding interest;605\n\n\u2013 Article 28 of the Tax Code recognizes penalties and interest related to tax assessments as \"*tax debt;*\u201d606\n\n\u2013 The Tax Tribunal recognized that a penalty assessment was to punish a \"*conduct or omission that violates [a tax] law*;\u201d607\n\n\u2013 The Constitutional Court recognized that \"*charging moratory interest on tax debts is aimed at encouraging its payment on time, as well as compensating the tax creditor for the delay on the collection of the debt*.\u201d608\n\nBravo-Pic\u00f3n II (**RER-8**), \u00b6\u00b6 255 *et seq.*\n\nLaw Delegating to the Executive Branch the Power to Legislate on Matters of Economic Reactivation and Formalization, Citizen Security, Fight Against Corruption, Water and Sanitation and Reorganization of Petroper\u00fa S.A., Law No. 30506 dated 6 October 2016 (published on 9 October 2016) (**RE-327**), Article 2(1)(a)(5).\n\nLaw Establishing Tax Measures, Simplification of Procedures, and Permits for Promoting and Revitalizing Investment in the Country, Law No. 30230 dated 12 July 2014 (**CA-209**), Articles 4.1-4.3.\n\nTax Code, Supreme Decree No. 133-2013-EF dated 22 June 2013 (**CA-14**), Article 28.\n\nTax Tribunal, Resolution No. 04170-1-2011 dated 16 March 2011 (**CA-394**), p. 4.\n\nConstitutional Court, Decision, Case No. 02169-2016-PA/TC dated 19 April 2022 (**CA-429**), \u00b6 40.\n\n552.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the penalties and interest on the Tax Assessments (and SUNAT's failure to waive them) constitute measures that fall within the State's domestic tax regime.\n\n553.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant's claims based on Article 10.5 of the TPA for the Tax Assessments' penalties and interest assessed against SMCV are not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as they constitute \"*taxation measures*\u201d excluded by Article 22.3.1 of the TPA.\n\n**C. The Respondent's claim that the acts or facts upon which the Claimant bases its claim occurred before the entry into force of the TPA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's claims are based on acts or facts that occurred before the TPA entered into force on 1 February 2009, and thus, the claims fall outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction in accordance with Article 10.1.3 of the TPA.609\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 469 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 778 *et seq*.; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 288 *et seq.*\n\n555.\n\nThe Respondent submits that nothing in the TPA provides for the retroactive application of investment protections or the dispute resolution mechanisms in Chapter Ten.610 Article 28 of the VCLT and Article 13 of the ILC Articles support the Respondent's argument that the Treaty does not apply retroactively.611 The Respondent adds that in interpreting identical language in CAFTA, for example, the *Spence v. Costa Rica* tribunal concluded that where the alleged conduct that gives rise to a claimant's claim is \"*deeply and inseparably rooted*\u201d in a respondent's \"*pre-CAFTA entry into force conduct*,\u201d the tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear that claim.612 The Respondent submits that this finding is consistent with international law precedents such as the *Phosphates in Morocco* case.613\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 470.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 470-471.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 472; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 779, referring to: *Spence v.

Costa Rica* tribunal, \"*deeply and inseparably rooted*\u201d in SUNAT's and MINEM's interpretation of the Agreement and the underlying laws and regulations, expressed *inter alia* in the June 2006 Report.619 The Respondent adds that the record even shows that MINEM's position taken in the June 2006 Report reflects the State's position on the scope of the Mining Law and Regulations and stabilization agreements in general (including the 1998 Stability Agreement) as held for many years before the issuance of that Report.620 While the Respondent denies that SUNAT solely relied on the June 2006 Report in determining that the Assessments were due, the Respondent asserts that the heart of the Claimant's case is that the June 2006 Report was key to SUNAT's determinations.621\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 475 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6 35.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 783.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 477-478.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 479.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 480.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 477; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 782.\n\n558.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's assertion that the TPA applies to \"*measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to*\u201d a protected investor and investment, and that the relevant analysis under Article 10.1.3 of the TPA is only whether the measure alleged to constitute the breach predates the TPA's entry into force.622 According to the Respondent, the Claimant's interpretation is incorrect, because it is inconsistent with (i) the broad wording of Article 10.1.3 of the TPA, (ii) relevant investment arbitration jurisprudence, including *Spence v. Costa Rica, Mondev v. United States*, *Eco Oro v. Colombia*, *Tecmed v. Mexico*, and *M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador*, and (iii) the intent of the TPA parties.623\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 784; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 265.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 784 *et seq.*\n\n559.\n\nWith respect to the alleged breaches of Article 10.5 of the TPA, the Respondent submits that most of the Claimant's claims of breaches of the TPA are also deeply and inseparably rooted in acts or facts that occurred before 1 February 2009, and as such fall outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, with the sole exception of Claimant's TPA Article 10.5 claims based on alleged due process violations.624\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 483 *et seq.*\n\n560.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's Royalty Assessments claims based on the frustration of legitimate expectations, arbitrary action, and inconsistent and non-transparent action, the Respondent submits that by the Claimant's own account, the acts or facts that formed the basis of the Claimant's claims occurred well before the TPA's entry into force.625 The Respondent argues that the Claimant (or SMCV) was or should have been aware of Peru's position regarding stabilization agreements and, in particular, the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement even before June 2006.626 According to the Respondent, whether it manifested in the June 2006 Report or even earlier, there is no question that the Respondent's interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement and the related Peruvian laws and regulations is the basis of all of the breaches of Article 10.5 of the TPA that the Claimant alleges with respect to legitimate expectations, arbitrary actions, and inconsistency and non-transparency.627\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 485.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 486.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 487.\n\n561.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's Royalty Assessment claims based on due process violations, the Respondent concedes that these are the only TPA breach claims that do not pre-date the entry into force of the TPA.628\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 488.\n\n562.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's claims based on SUNAT's imposition of penalties and interest on Royalty and Tax Assessments, the Respondent argues that these claims are also rooted in acts or facts that occurred before the TPA entered into force.629 According to the Respondent, by the Claimant's own account, such claims are also rooted in MINEM's June 2006 Report, which pre-dates the TPA's entry into force.630 Specifically, the Respondent argues that SUNAT's assessments of these penalties and interest (and the Tax Tribunal's decisions to maintain those penalties and interest), like SUNAT's assessment of royalties and taxes, are based on the Peruvian government's interpretation of the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement and the Mining Law and Regulations, and in particular, by the Claimant's own account, MINEM's interpretation contained in its June 2006 Report.631\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 489.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 491.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 797*.*\n\n563.\n\nFinally, with respect to the Claimant's claims based on the Respondent's refusal to refund GEM payments, the Respondent argues that such claims are also outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction because such claims are also rooted in acts or facts that occurred before the TPA entered into force.632 The Respondent argues that this claim is based on SUNAT's Royalty and Tax Assessments against SMCV, which were issued (according to the Claimant) based on MINEM's June 2006 Report, and (according to the Respondent) consistent with the Respondent's even earlier interpretation of the Mining Law and Regulations and the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement.633\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 492.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 492.\n\n**2. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n564.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione temporis* because its claims do not require a retroactive application of the TPA.634 Specifically, all the acts and facts that the Claimant alleges constitute breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement and the TPA occurred after the TPA entered into force.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 263 *et seq.*; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 70 *et seq*.; Claimant's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 18 *et seq.*; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 113 *et seq.*\n\n565.\n\nThe Claimant submits that contrary to the Respondent's argument, it does not allege that the June 2006 Report or any other acts or facts pre-dating 1 February 2009 constituted breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement or Article 10.5 of the TPA. Rather, the acts and facts that the Claimant alleges constituted breaches are the final and enforceable Assessments, arbitrary decisions refusing to waive penalties and interest, due process violations in the Tax Tribunal proceedings, and arbitrary decisions denying SMCV's GEM reimbursement request, which all post-date 1 February 2009.635\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 264.\n\n566.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent confuses the applicable legal principles.636 According to the Claimant, the relevant analysis is whether any of the \"*measures*,\u201d as defined in the TPA, that the Claimant alleges breached the 1998 Stability Agreement or Article 10.5 are an \"*act or fact that took place or [a] situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force*.\u201d637\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 265.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 265.\n\n567.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the acts that represent the basis of its claims occurred long after 1 February 2009.638 Specifically, the Claimant alleges that (i) each final and enforceable Assessment breached the 1998 Stability Agreement on a number of dates after 1 February 2009, (ii) each final and enforceable Royalty Assessment breached Article 10.5 of the TPA on a number of dates after 1 February 2009, (iii) the arbitrary failure of the Supreme Court to consider *de novo* SMCV's entitlement to a waiver of penalties and interest on the 2008 Royalty Assessments and the arbitrary failure of the Appellate Court to consider *de novo* SMCV's entitlement to a waiver of penalties and interest on the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments breached Article 10.5 of the TPA on 21 July 2017 and 10 October 2017, respectively, when the courts notified SMCV of their decisions, (iv) each of the remaining arbitrary failures to waive penalties and interest breached Article 10.5 of the TPA on a number of dates after 1 February 2009, and (v) the Respondent's arbitrary refusal to reimburse Q4 2011 to Q3 2012 GEM payments for activities related to the Concentrator breached Article 10.5 of the TPA on 22 March 2019 when SUNAT notified SMCV of its decision rejecting SMCV's reimbursement request.639\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 266; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 72.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 266.\n\n568.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the Respondent's interpretation of Article 10.1.3 of the TPA is inconsistent with the intent of the TPA parties, as demonstrated through the TPA's negotiation record.640 The Parties adopted what became Article 10.1.3 of the TPA with the understanding that it \"*would not apply to bar claims simply because the challenged measures related to acts or facts that gave rise to a dispute before the TPA entered into force so long as the challenged measures themselves occurred after the entry into force*.\u201d641\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 267; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 73; US-Andean FTA Draft dated 19 July 2004 (**CE-1062**), p. 2; MINCETUR, Round I Summary (Cartagena, 18-19 May 2004) (**CE-1060**), pp. 25-27; MINCETUR, Round II Summary (Atlanta, 14 to 18 June 2004) (**CE-1061**), pp. 23-25.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 267; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 73; Herrera I (**CWS-12**), \u00b6 35; Sampliner I (**CER-11**), \u00b6 39.\n\n569.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent's argument also fails because the June 2006 Report is expressly non-binding.642 Moreover, according to the Claimant, the Respondent concedes that the non-retroactivity rule does not apply to \"*Claimant's TPA Article 10.5 claims based on alleged due process violations*\u201d but offers no explanation for why the June 2006 Report is the *sine qua non* for other breaches that are not based on the interpretation in the June 2006 Report.643\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 268; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 74.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 268; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 74.\n\n570.\n\nFinally, the Claimant submits that other investment tribunals have uniformly recognized that while acts or facts predating the TPA are relevant to Peru's breaches this does not make those breaches fall outside the Tribunal's temporal jurisdiction.644\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 269, referring to: *Spence v.

The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n572.\n\nThe NDP submits that while a host State's conduct prior to the entry into force of an obligation may be relevant to determining whether the State subsequently breached that obligation, under the rule against retroactivity, there must exist \"*conduct of the State after that date which is itself a breach*.\u201d646 The NDP refers to the findings of the *Carrizosa v. Colombia* tribunal, which observed with respect to the identical provision of the United States-Colombia TPA, that \"*unless the post-treaty conduct [\u2026] is itself capable of constituting a breach of the [treaty], independently from the question of (un)lawfulness of the pre-treaty conduct, claims arising out of such post-treaty conduct would also fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction*.\u201d647 The NDP submits that this finding echoes the *Berkowitz v. Costa Rica* tribunal's holding under the Dominican Republic-Central America FTA that \"*pre-entry into force conduct cannot be relied upon to establish the breach in circumstances in which the post-entry into force conduct would not otherwise constitute an actionable breach in its own right. Pre-entry into force acts and facts cannot [\u2026] constitute a cause of action*.\u201d648\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 2.\n\n**4. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n573.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that the TPA does not apply to conduct that predates its entry into force on 1 February 2009.649 This is based on the customary international law rule according to which a treaty does not bind contracting States in respect of acts or facts predating the entry into force of the treaty, unless it provides otherwise.650\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 470; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 263.\n\nVienna Convention on the Law of Treaties dated 23 May 1969 (**CA-49**), Article 28; ILC Articles (**CA-82)**, Article 13.\n\n574.\n\nIn the case at hand, the TPA does not provide for a different rule. Article 10.1 of the TPA provides:\n\n*1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or maintained by a Party [\u2026]*. *[\u2026]*\n\n*3. For greater certainty, this Chapter does not bind any Party in relation to any act or fact that took place or any situation that ceased to exist before the date of entry into force of this Agreement*.651\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.1.\n\n575.\n\nThe Parties are rather in dispute as to how the non-retroactivity rule should apply in this case. The Respondent's position is that the Claimant's allegations of breach are, in the words of the *Spence v. Costa Rica* tribunal, \"*deeply and inseparably*\u201d rooted in MINEM's interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement and Mining Law and Regulations, which was established by the Claimant's own account no later than June 2006 through the June 2006 Report.652 Relying on the *M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador* tribunal's findings, the Respondent also contends that the dispute arose prior to the Treaty's entry into force and that prior disputes that continue after the entry into force of the Treaty are not covered by it.653 The Respondent states that the dispute arose on 4 June 2008, when SMCV wrote to SUNAT indicating that it disagreed with SUNAT's audit letter of 30 May 2008.654\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 472 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 789, referring to: *M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, Award (**RA-11**), \u00b6 66.\n\nSUNAT, Inductive Letter No. 108052004279 dated 30 May 2008 (**CE-577**); Letter from SMCV to SUNAT, Letter No. SMCV-AL-1346-2008 dated 4 June 2008 (**CE-578**), p. 1.\n\n576.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimant submits that it does not allege that the June 2006 Report or any other acts or facts pre-dating 1 February 2009 constituted breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement or Article 10.5 of the TPA. Rather, the acts and facts that the Claimant alleges constituted breaches are SUNAT's Assessments, the alleged arbitrary decisions refusing to waive penalties and interest, the alleged due process violations in the Tax Tribunal proceedings, and the alleged arbitrary decision denying SMCV's GEM reimbursement request, which all post-date 1 February 2009.655\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 264 *et seq*.\n\n577.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, in applying the non-retroactivity rule, the relevant standard is whether the State's \"*measures*\u201d for which the Claimant brings claims occurred after the entry into force of the Treaty. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that both Parties refer to the findings of the *Tecmed v. Mexico* tribunal, which found that:\n\n*[C]onsideration of whether the Agreement is to be applied retroactively must first be determined in light of the claims of the Parties. The mandate of an arbitration tribunal is subject to limitations, among them those arising out of disputed issues specifically referred to it by the Parties in their claims.*656\n\n*Tecmed v. Mexico*, Award (**CA-99**), \u00b6 56.\n\n578.\n\nIn this case, while the Claimant certainly refers to acts or facts pre-dating the entry into force of the Treaty, including the June 2006 Report, the Claimant only claims for State measures that occurred after its entry into force.657 All of the measures framed in the Claimant's claims occurred after 1 February 2009 and, thus, do not lead to a retroactive application of the Treaty.\n\nThe Claimant claims that (i) each final and enforceable Assessment breached the Stability Agreement on a number of dates after 1 February 2009 (identified in Table A of the Claimant's Memorial), (ii) each final and enforceable Royalty Assessment breached Article 10.5 of the TPA on a number of dates after 1 February 2009 (identified in Table A of the Claimant's Memorial), (iii) the arbitrary failure of the Supreme Court to consider *de novo* SMCV's entitlement to a waiver of penalties and interest on the 2008 Royalty Assessments and the arbitrary failure of the Appellate Court to consider *de novo* SMCV's entitlement to a waiver of penalties and interest on the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments breached Article 10.5 of the TPA on 21 July 2017 and 10 October 2017, respectively, when the courts notified SMCV of their decisions, (iv) each of the remaining arbitrary failures to waive penalties and interest breached Article 10.5 of the TPA on a number of dates after 1 February 2009 (identified in Table B of the Claimant's Memorial), and (v) the Respondent's arbitrary refusal to reimburse Q4 2011 to Q3 2012 GEM payments for activities related to the Concentrator breached Article 10.5 of the TPA on 22 March 2019 when SUNAT notified SMCV of its decision rejecting SMCV's reimbursement request. See Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 266.\n\n579.\n\nThis conclusion does not prevent the Tribunal from otherwise considering any pre-Treaty conduct. As clarified by the commentary to the ILC Articles, pre-treaty conduct may carry relevance in a tribunal's determinations:\n\n*Nor does the principle of the intertemporal law mean that facts occurring prior to the entry into force of a particular obligation may not be taken into account where these are otherwise relevant.*658\n\nJames Crawford, *The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility* (2002) (excerpts) (**RA-26**), p. 134 (Article 13, comment 9).\n\n580.\n\nThis conclusion has been further supported by tribunals such as the *Mondev v. United States* tribunal, which found that:\n\n*[E]vents or conduct prior to the entry into force of an obligation for the respondent State may be relevant in determining whether the State has subsequently committed a breach of the obligation. But it must still be possible to point to conduct of the State after that date which is itself a breach.*659\n\n*Mondev v. USA*, Award (**RA-6**), \u00b6 70.\n\n581.\n\nThe *Spence v. Costa Rica* tribunal also found:\n\n*CAFTA Article 10.1.3 does not preclude [the Tribunal] from having regard to pre-CAFTA entry into force conduct for purposes of determining whether there was a post-entry into force breach\u201d subject only to the limitation that \"pre-entry into force conduct cannot be relied upon to establish the breach in circumstances in which the post-entry into force conduct would not otherwise constitute an actionable breach in its own right.*660\n\n*Spence v. Costa Rica*, Interim Award (**RA-2**), \u00b6 217.\n\n582.\n\nThe *M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador* tribunal similarly held:\n\n*Acts or omissions prior to the entry into force of the BIT may be taken into account by the Tribunal in cases in which those acts or omissions are relevant as background, causal link, or the basis of circumstances surrounding the occurrence of a dispute from the time the wrongful act was consummated after the entry into force of the norm that had been breached. The Tribunal, however, finds that it has no Competence to determine damages for acts that do not qualify as violations of the BIT as they occurred prior to its entry into force.*661\n\n*M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, Award (**RA-11**), \u00b6 136.\n\n583.\n\nAccordingly, while the Tribunal has no competence over any alleged breaches of pre-Treaty measures, no such pre-Treaty measures have been claimed against by the Claimant. The Tribunal is not prevented from taking into consideration any acts or facts that pre-date the entry into force of the Treaty.\n\n584.\n\nAgainst this background, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent's objection is unfounded.\n\n**D. The Respondent's claim that the Claimant's claims of alleged breaches of the TPA are outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction because they have already been submitted to dispute settlement procedures in Peru**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n585.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims on behalf of SMCV of alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement because they have already been submitted for resolution before administrative tribunals and binding dispute settlement procedures in Peru.662 According to the Respondent, Article 10.18.4 of the TPA bars the submission of such claims before the Tribunal. The Respondent further relies on the reasoning of several arbitral tribunals, including *M.C.I. Power v. Ecuador*, *Supervisi\u00f3n y Control v. Costa Rica*, *Pantechniki v. Albania*, and *H & H v. Egypt*, which emphasized the irrevocability of a claimant's dispute settlement choice when interpreting a fork-in-the-road provision.663\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 494 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 801 *et seq.*; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 292 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 495, referring to: *M.C.I. v. Ecuador*, Award (**RA-11**), \u00b6 181; *Supervisi\u00f3n y Control S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/4, Award dated 18 January 2017 (**CA-228**), \u00b6 294; *Pantechniki S.A. Contractors & Engineers (Greece) v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award dated 30 July 2009 (**RA-12**), \u00b6 67; *H&H Enterprises Investments, Inc. v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/15, Award dated 6 May 2014 (excerpts) (**RA-13**), \u00b6 370.\n\n586.\n\nThe Respondent argues that on numerous occasions SMCV has definitively and irrevocably challenged before SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal (using the same legal basis as invoked in this case) the same SUNAT Royalty and Tax Assessments (and related measures, such as the penalties and interest assessed thereon) that the Claimant now alleges constitute breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement on SMCV's behalf.664 The Respondent further states that in all the challenges that SUNAT's Claims Division decided, it confirmed all the Assessments against SMCV, and that SMCV itself withdrew several challenges before a decision was rendered.665 SMCV appealed most of SUNAT's decisions confirming those Assessments to the Tax Tribunal. The Respondent submits that the only claims that are left are those based on the 2013 Income Tax and Additional Income Tax Assessments, and the 2012 Temporary Tax on Net Assets Assessment, because SMCV did not challenge them before SUNAT's Claims Division or the Tax Tribunal.666\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 496, 498, Annex A, pp. 1-10.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 497; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 805.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 497.\n\n587.\n\nThe Respondent states that SMCV's claims before SUNAT's Claims Division, and subsequently before the Tax Tribunal, are all part of the same administrative dispute settlement proceedings that resolve disputes over royalty and tax assessments, in the first and second instance.667 The Respondent explains that the Tax Tribunal is an administrative tribunal whose decisions are final and binding under Peruvian law.668 The Respondent adds that the Claimant's own words confirm its understanding that the Tax Tribunal is an administrative tribunal.669 Similarly, the Respondent argues that SUNAT's Claims Division is an administrative body before which SUNAT's decisions can be challenged, and the resulting decisions are binding on the taxpayer and SUNAT (unless successfully appealed to the Tax Tribunal).670 Even if the Tribunal were not to consider SUNAT's Claims Division to be an administrative \"*tribunal*\u201d as such, the Claims Division's administrative process to challenge SUNAT actions constitutes a \"*binding dispute settlement procedure*\u201d for purposes of the TPA's fork-in-the-road provision.671 Alternatively, even if the Tribunal were to find that SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal do not constitute \"*an administrative tribunal*\u201d or a \"*binding dispute settlement procedure,*\u201d the Claimant's claims of alleged breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement submitted in these proceedings would still fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction, because SMCV has submitted claims regarding the same alleged breaches to the Peruvian courts (*i.e*., the Superior Court of Lima, and the Supreme Court) which unquestionably qualify as \"*court[s] of the respondent*\u201d under Article 10.18.4 of the TPA.672\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 500; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 808.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 501-502; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 809, 818-821.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 809.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 503.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 503.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 803-804, 849-851.\n\n588.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's reliance on Article 19.5.1 of the TPA with respect to the characterization of SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal. The Respondent argues that Article 19.5.1 of the TPA does not provide a definition of \"*administrative tribunal*\u201d and only discusses administrative tribunals, as one among a number of adjudicatory bodies, for a different purpose in the Treaty.673 Moreover, the Respondent submits that contrary to the Claimant's contention, SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal review SUNAT's Assessments, which are final administrative actions.674 In addition, the Respondent submits that even though SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal are structurally part of the MEF, they operate independently of the MEF, making them impartial and independent of the office or authority entrusted with administrative enforcement, as allegedly required by Article 19.5.1 of the TPA.675\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 811.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 812.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 813-816.\n\n589.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimant is precluded from submitting its claims to arbitration because these claims rest on the same fundamental basis as SMCV's claims before SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal.676 The Respondent relies on the fundamental-basis test which examines whether the bases of the claims are the same.677 The Respondent states that under this test, claims are considered the same if the bases of the claims are the same, if, for example, deciding the claim that is submitted to arbitration would require the tribunal to reach and resolve the same underlying dispute at issue in the claim previously submitted to the other dispute resolution forum.678 The Respondent submits that the fundamental-basis test is better suited than the so-called triple-identity test and that it has been favored by tribunals.679 In any event, the triple-identity test would also be met here.680\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 505 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 825 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 506; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 826.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 506.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 508-510.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 507; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 840.\n\n590.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 10.18.4(a) of the TPA does not require the application of the triple-identity test. Instead, Article 10.18.4(a) of the TPA focuses on the subject matter of the dispute. The Respondent argues that its interpretation of Article 10.18.4 of the TPA is consistent with the relevant investment arbitration jurisprudence,681 the text, object, and purpose of the fork-in-the-road provision,682 as well as the intent of the TPA parties.683\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 832 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 834 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 841 *et seq.*\n\n591.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the claims in these proceedings and those before SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal have the same fundamental basis because:\n\n1) The claims are derived from the same factual basis, *i.e.,* they are complaints against SUNAT's Royalty and Tax Assessments;\n\n2) The claims rest on the same legal basis, *i.e.,* the complaint that SUNAT's Royalty and Tax Assessments are contrary to the 1998 Stability Agreement;\n\n3) A finding on the merits of SMCV's arbitration claims depends on resolving the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement, which is the same dispute and the same legal question that underlay SMCV's claims before SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal.684\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 515-516; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 827-830.\n\n592.\n\nThe Respondent argues that since these claims are in fact the same under the fundamental-basis test, this arbitration is an attempt at relitigating SMCV's claims which were brought before Peruvian domestic courts.685\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 517.\n\n**2. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n593.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Article 10.18.4 of the TPA does not apply because SMCV did not submit claims for breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement to a Peruvian administrative tribunal or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure.686 Rather, SMCV submitted administrative challenges to the validity of the majority of the Assessments to two agencies of the MEF, *i.e.,* SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal.687\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 242 *et seq.*; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 47 *et seq*.; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 109 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 242.\n\n594.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's interpretation of Article 10.18.4 of the TPA would lead to an absurd result of requiring investors to submit SUNAT royalty or tax assessments to international arbitration without having them reviewed first through the normal administrative process within the MEF.688 The Claimant argues that Article 10.18.4 of the TPA does not apply unless SMCV previously submitted a \"*claim*\u201d for any of the \"*the same alleged breach[es]*\u201d of the 1998 Stability Agreement that Freeport submits in this case, noting that the Respondent itself concedes that SMCV never submitted claims for breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement in any forum.689 The Claimant further argues that the fundamental-basis-test proposed by the Respondent finds no support in the plain terms of the TPA, its negotiation history, or investment treaty authorities.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 245; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 50.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 246; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 51.\n\n595.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant argues that the Respondent's argument based on the fundamental-basis-test is detached from the plain terms of Article 10.18.4 of the TPA. Contrasting Article 10.18.4 of the TPA with the waiver provision under Article 10.18.2, which refers to \"*any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach,*\u201d shows that Article 10.18.4 is narrowly limited to previous claims for the \"*same alleged breach*.\u201d690 The Claimant states that if an investor was precluded from submitting to international arbitration a claim for breach of an investment agreement because it had previously submitted a claim with respect to the measure alleged to constitute the breach, it would be unnecessary to require the investor to waive its right to continue proceedings with respect to that measure. The existence of any such proceedings would preclude the investor from submitting the claim for breach of the investment agreement to international arbitration in the first place.691 Moreover, the Claimant argues that Article 10.18.4 of the TPA must be read in a manner that is consistent with the object and purpose of the TPA, not the object and purpose of fork-in-the-road provisions in different treaties or in academic writings as the Respondent argues.692 The Claimant also argues that the Respondent's interpretation is inconsistent with the intent of the TPA parties as evidenced by the negotiating history and the testimony of representatives of both the Peruvian and U.S. delegations.693 In addition, according to the Claimant, investment tribunals, such as the *Corona v. Dominican Republic*, *Nissan v. India*, and *Kappes v. Guatemala* tribunals, have consistently rejected arguments attempting to expand fork-in-the-road provisions beyond their express terms to import a \"*fundamental basis*,\u201d \"*triple identity*,\u201d or \"*same dispute*\u201d standard.694\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 251; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 56.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 56.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 57.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 58.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 253, referring to: *Corona Materials v.

Article 148 of the Peruvian Constitution and Article 157 of the Tax Code entrust review of final royalty and tax decisions to the contentious-administrative courts, which, unlike SUNAT and the Tax Tribunal, are part of the Peruvian judiciary.698\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 258 *et seq.*; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 63 *et seq*.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 258.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 258-260.\n\n598.\n\nIn addition, according to the Claimant, neither SUNAT's Claims Division nor the Tax Tribunal is competent to resolve claims for breach of an investment agreement meaning that they cannot provide the \"*other binding dispute settlement procedures*\u201d that Article 10.18.4 of the TPA contemplates.699 Under Article 10.18.4 of the TPA, a claim is barred only if a claim for the same alleged breach of the investment agreement or investment authorization was submitted to an adjudicative body competent to resolve contract claims for breach of an investment agreement, a qualification that neither SUNAT's Claims Division nor the Tax Tribunal meet.700 The Claimant submits that the term \"*other binding dispute resolution procedures*\u201d was only intended to encompass proceedings before bodies competent to resolve claims for breach of an investment agreement.701 Under Peruvian law, contract claims can only be resolved by arbitration or through a judicial proceeding.702\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 256 *et seq.*; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 63 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 256.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 257; Sampliner I (**CER-11**), \u00b6 35; Herrera I (**CWS-12**), \u00b6 29.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 257.\n\n**3. The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n599.\n\nThe NDP has not expressed its view on the interpretation of Article 10.18.4 of the TPA.\n\n**4. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n600.\n\nArticle 10.18.4 of the TPA provides:\n\n*(a) No claim may be submitted to arbitration:*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*(ii) for breach of an investment agreement under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C),*\n\n*if the claimant (for claims brought under 10.16.1(a)) or the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under 10.16.1(b)) has previously submitted the same alleged breach to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure.*\n\n*(b) For greater certainty, if a claimant elects to submit a claim of the type described in subparagraph (a) to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure, that election shall be definitive, and the claimant may not thereafter submit the claim to arbitration under Section B.*703\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.18.4.\n\n601.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties have extensively briefed the Tribunal on the irrevocability of the fork-in-the-road choice as set out in Article 10.18.4(b) of the TPA. However, the crucial issue for the Tribunal's determination is whether the Claimant or SMCV previously submitted the \"*same alleged breach*\u201d to an administrative tribunal or court of Peru or to any other binding dispute settlement.\n\n602.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Article 10.18.4 of the TPA is to be interpreted according to the \"*fundamental-basis*-*test*\u201d or, alternatively, the \"*triple-identity test*.\u201d According to the Claimant, such tests find no support in the express terms of the TPA.\n\n603.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the term \"*same alleged breach*\u201d is not defined in the TPA. The meaning of that notion is thus a matter for treaty interpretation that is subject to the general principles of interpretation of the VCLT.\n\n604.\n\nThe Tribunal first turns to the ordinary meaning of \"*same alleged breach*\u201d in the context of the TPA and in light of its object and purpose. The word \"*same*\u201d indicates that, for the fork-in-the-road provision of the TPA to operate, the claimant or the enterprise must have brought an identical claim for adjudication in the respondent State for an alleged breach of an investment agreement. The Tribunal finds that the TPA unequivocally bars only the successive submission of identical breaches of an investment agreement. This presupposes that there be identical claims for identical breaches of identical obligations, and not just similar or related claims, or claims which share a \"*fundamental basis*\u201d or \"*identity*.\u201d In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the cases cited in support of the Respondent's \"*fundamental*-*basis-test*\u201d concerned treaties with a fork in the road clause in relation to a \"*same dispute*.\u201d704 Such treaty wording is different from the TPA, which narrowly applies to the \"*same alleged breach*.\u201d\n\n*Pantechniki v. Albania*, Award (**RA-12**), \u00b6 67; *H&H Enterprises v. Egypt*, Award (**RA-13**), \u00b6\u00b6 362, 364; *Supervisi\u00f3n y Control v. Costa Rica*, Award (**CA-228**), \u00b6\u00b6 296, 310.\n\n605.\n\nThe Tribunal's interpretation is consistent with the context of the Treaty. Specifically, the wording of Article 10.18.4 of the TPA can be contrasted with the wording of the waiver provision in Article 10.18.2 of the TPA according to which claims under Article 10.16.1 (a) and (b) may only be submitted to arbitration if there has been a waiver of any right to initiate or continue \"*any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach*.\u201d705 The wording of Article 10.18.2 is wider than the wording of Article 10.18.4. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that if Article 10.18.4 of the TPA were to apply to claims \"*with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach*,\u201d the waiver requirement under Article 10.18.2 of the TPA would be rendered meaningless, as all claims \"*with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach*\u201d that the investor had previously submitted would be excluded from arbitration and there would be no need to waive the right to continue proceedings for those claims before submitting them to arbitration.706\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.18.2.\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.18.2.\n\n606.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, for the fork-in-the-road provision to bar the Claimant's claims, SMCV or the Claimant must have previously submitted the same claims for breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement for adjudication in Peru. It is undisputed that the Claimant itself did not submit any claims for adjudication in Peru. The dispute in Peru rather concerned SMCV's challenges of the different Tax and Royalty Assessments imposed by SUNAT.\n\n607.\n\nWhile the interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement was a key issue in the underlying proceedings before SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal, none of those proceedings concerned a claim for a breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement, *i.e.,* a claim that the Claimant is bringing forward in these proceedings. The fact that SUNAT's Claims Division, the Tax Tribunal, and Peruvian courts have interpreted the 1998 Stability Agreement does not prevent the Claimant from bringing its claims before this Tribunal. As correctly described by the Claimant's expert Dr. Bullard, SMCV did not seek a decision by the Peruvian courts holding the Respondent liable for breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement and ordering payment of corresponding damages, nor did it make claims arising from the Respondent's breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement governed by Peruvian civil law.707\n\nBullard II (**CER-7**), \u00b6\u00b6 63-66.\n\n608.\n\nHaving concluded that SMCV did not submit claims for the \"*same alleged breach*\u201d for adjudication in Peru, the Tribunal is not required to resolve the issue of whether SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal are \"*administrative tribunals*\u201d of Peru or whether the proceedings before SUNAT's Claims Division and the Tax Tribunal constituted \"*binding dispute settlement procedures.*\u201d\n\n609.\n\nIn light of the above considerations, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent's objection on the basis of Article 10.18.4 of the TPA.\n\n**E. The Respondent's claim that the Claimant may not submit claims for breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement on behalf of SMCV because it has failed to prove that it relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement when it established or acquired its covered investments**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n610.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant may not submit claims for breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement on behalf of SMCV pursuant to Article 10.16.1(b) because the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that it relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement when it established or acquired its covered investments.708\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 519 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 854 *et seq.*; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 297.\n\n611.\n\nFirst, the Respondent argues that pursuant to Article 10.16.1(b) of the TPA, a claimant may submit \"*on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly*,\u201d a claim for breach of an \"*investment agreement*\u201d only if two requirements are met: (1) the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages must directly relate to the covered investment, and (2) the claimant must have relied on the investment agreement when it established or acquired the covered investment.709 If a claimant fails to meet both of these conditions for claims alleging a breach of an investment agreement, then a tribunal may not exercise jurisdiction over those claims.710 Both for the purpose of demonstrating that the 1998 Stability Agreement is an \"*investment agreement*\u201d under the TPA and for the purpose of bringing a claim for breach of that Agreement in these proceedings, the Claimant must show that it relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement when it established or acquired its covered investment, but the Claimant has failed to do so.711\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 519; TPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.16.1(b).\n\nRespondent's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6 42.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 856.\n\n612.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent contends that the TPA expressly requires a claimant's reliance on the investment agreement in a situation where a claimant is submitting a claim, on its own behalf or on behalf of an enterprise it owns or controls, for breach of an investment agreement.712 By contrast, the TPA does not require such reliance in a situation where a claimant is submitting a claim, on its own behalf or on behalf of an enterprise it owns or controls, either of breach of an obligation under Section A of Chapter Ten of the TPA or of breach of an investment authorization.713 According to the Respondent, such contrast confirms the deliberate intent of the contracting parties of the TPA to require a claimant's reliance specifically if a claimant is submitting a claim for breach of an investment agreement.714 If a claimant fails to prove that it relied on an investment agreement when it established or acquired its covered investment, the claimant is barred from submitting a claim for breach of that investment agreement.715\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 860 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 521.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 522.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 522 *et seq*.\n\n613.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to show that it relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement in establishing or acquiring a covered investment. The Respondent argues that the Claimant alleges reliance on the 1998 Stability Agreement by other parties, such as Phelps Dodge, Cyprus, and SMCV, but not on its own.716 Moreover, those other parties' alleged reliance, even if proven, does not establish the Claimant's own reliance that is expressly required under Articles 10.16.1(b) and 10.28 of the TPA, since none of those parties is the Claimant in this arbitration.717\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 527.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 529.\n\n614.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its interpretation of Article 10.16.1 of the TPA is consistent with (i) the text of Article 10.16.1, (ii) the construction of Article 10.28, and (iii) the intent of the TPA parties.718\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 860 *et seq.*\n\n615.\n\nSpecifically, by its plain terms, Article 10.16.1 of the TPA provides that the reliance on an investment agreement must relate to the Claimant's (Freeport's) acquisition of its covered investments.719 The Respondent argues that the Claimant tries to meet this requirement merely by declaring its own reliance, but it does so without providing evidence.720 The Respondent argues that the evidence rather suggests that the Claimant likely did not rely on the 1998 Stability Agreement when it acquired its investments in SMCV.721 Among others, the Respondent refers to the Claimant's own statements and related news reports suggesting that the Claimant's acquisition of Phelps Dodge, through which the Claimant acquired 53.56% of SMCV, was specifically motivated by the Claimant's desire to expand the size of Freeport-McMoRan so that the Claimant could dominate the global mining industry.722 Such public statements make no mention of the 1998 Stability Agreement nor of the Concentrator Project or other such plans. According to the Respondent, such evidence shows that it is far more likely that Freeport would have purchased Phelps Dodge and thereby acquired its investments in Peru regardless of whether the 1998 Stability Agreement existed or was potentially applicable to the Concentrator Project.723 The Respondent also submits that the Claimant changed the description of its covered investments from SMCV, the \"*Cerro Verde production unit*,\u201d and the \"*Mining and Beneficiation Concessions*,\u201d in its Memorial to \"*the Concentrator*\u201d in its Reply.724\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 529; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 861 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 526.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 530.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 530-534; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 857, referring to: Andrew Ross Sorkin and Ian Austen, \"Mining Firms to Merge to Make a New No. 1 \u2013 Business \u2013 International Herald Tribune,\u201d *The New York Times* dated 19 November 2006 (**RE-108**); \"Freeport-McMoRan to Buy Phelps Dodge for $25.9B,\u201d *Reliable Plant*, *available at* https://www.reliableplant.com/Read/3474/freeportmcmoran-to-buy-phelps-dodge-for-$259b (**RE-109**); Steve James, \"Freeport Acquires Phelps Dodge, Launches Offering,\u201d *Reuters* dated 19 March 2007 (**CE-563**); \"Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. and Phelps Dodge Corp.

Thus, SMCV was not (and could not be) a covered investment (at all) under the TPA, whether of Phelps Dodge or of Freeport. On the same basis, SMCV's investment in the Concentrator was not (and could not) be a covered investment under the TPA, because the TPA was not in force at the time the investment was made.728 Moreover, neither SMCV nor the Concentrator were \"*covered investments*\u201d of Freeport under the TPA at the time SMCV made its investment in the Concentrator purportedly in reliance of the 1998 Stability Agreement.729 The Respondent submits that any investments purportedly established or acquired in reliance on the 1998 Stability Agreement before March 2007 (*i.e.,* the date of Freeport's acquisition of Phelps Dodge), either by SMCV or Phelps Dodge, cannot be Freeport's \"*covered investment*\u201d under the TPA in a claim brought by Freeport as the covered investor. As the Concentrator was constructed before that date, it was not Freeport's \"*covered investment*\u201d for purposes of the TPA, and SMCV's purported reliance on the Agreement in constructing the Concentrator would not bring the Claimant's claim on behalf of SMCV regarding breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement within the scope of Article 10.16.1 of the TPA.730\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 868.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 868.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 869.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 869.\n\n618.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the ordinary meaning of Article 10.16.1 of the TPA is clear and reasonable and, thus, the reliance on the TPA's preparatory work by the Claimant is barred under the VCLT and in any event inconclusive.731\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 872 *et seq.*\n\n619.\n\nEven if the Tribunal were to decide that SMCV, instead of the Claimant, could somehow meet Article 10.16.1's reliance requirement, the Claimant has not proven that SMCV relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement when SMCV invested in the Concentrator.732\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 877 ; Respondent's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6 46.\n\n620.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimant cannot rely on its predecessor-in-interest's purported reliance on the 1998 Stability Agreement in making its investment in the Concentrator Project in order to satisfy the reliance requirement under Article 10.16.1 of the TPA, either.733 The only fair reading of Article 10.16.1 of the TPA is to require a claimant's own reliance on the investment agreement. There is no suggestion in the text of the Treaty that a predecessor's reliance is an acceptable substitute.734 Moreover, such a rule would be incompatible with the Treaty's scope, which provides protections to U.S. and Peruvian investors (only), and it is only by happenstance that the Claimant's predecessor-in-interest is a U.S. company.735\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 878 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 878.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 878.\n\n621.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's reliance on the *De Levi v. Peru* award,736 the Respondent states that such reliance is not relevant to this case. According to the Respondent, that case discusses a party's ability to transfer a legal right, such as ownership, to a third party and says nothing about a predecessor's ability to transfer a historical fact or a behavior, *i.e.,* in this case, the predecessor's purported reliance on an agreement to make an investment.737 And even if the Claimant could step in the shoes of Phelps Dodge's alleged reliance, the Claimant would still not meet the reliance requirements under Article 10.16.1 of the TPA because when Phelps Dodge invested in the Concentrator from 2004 to 2006, the Concentrator was not (and could not be) a covered investment under the TPA, as the TPA did not enter into force until February 2009.738 Additionally, the Concentrator cannot be a covered investment of Freeport under the TPA at the time when Phelps Dodge's purported reliance occurred, because Freeport did not acquire Phelps Dodge (through which it acquired SMCV) until March 2007, which is also before the TPA's entry into force.739 In any event, the Claimant would still fail on factual grounds because the Claimant has not proven that Phelps Dodge actually did rely on the 1998 Stability Agreement when it decided to invest in the Concentrator.740\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 285.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 879.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 869, 879.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 879.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 880.\n\n**2. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n622.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the 1998 Stability Agreement is an investment agreement upon which SMCV relied when establishing or acquiring the covered investment in the Concentrator and for which the Claimant may bring claims under Article 10.16.1(b) of the TPA.741\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 290 *et seq.*; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 276 *et seq.*; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 85 *et seq.*; Claimant's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 29 *et seq.*; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 122 *et seq.*\n\n623.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Article 10.28 of the TPA defines an investment agreement as an agreement on which either a claimant or an enterprise relied in establishing or acquiring a covered investment.742 The Claimant contends that the 1998 Stability Agreement is an investment agreement under this provision.743 This is because: (i) MINEM is a \"*national authority of a Party*\u201d, (ii) Freeport's \"*covered investment*\u201d is SMCV, an \"*enterprise*\u201d that Freeport owns or controls, and (iii) the \"*covered investment*\u201d that SMCV established or acquired in reliance on the 1998 Stability Agreement is the Concentrator.744\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 86.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 276; Claimant's Memorial, \u00b6 295.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 88.\n\n624.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Freeport, through its predecessors-in-interest, \"*relied*\u201d on the 1998 Stability Agreement when \"*establishing or acquiring*\u201d its covered investment in SMCV and its covered investment in the Cerro Verde Mining Unit, including the investment to construct the Concentrator.745 The Claimant also submits that SMCV \"*relied*\u201d on the 1998 Stability Agreement when \"*establishing or acquiring*\u201d its covered investment in the Cerro Verde Mining Unit, including the investment to construct the Concentrator.746 The Claimant argues that Article 10.16.1 of the TPA does not say that a claimant must demonstrate that it relied on an investment agreement to submit an Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C) claim for breach of that agreement on behalf of an enterprise that the claimant owns or controls; rather, the Claimant must only show that SMCV relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement to submit a claim for breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement on behalf of SMCV under Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C).747 In any event, according to the Claimant, even if Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C) required the reliance of the claimant, the Claimant would be entitled to invoke the reliance of its predecessor-in-interest, Phelps Dodge.748 The Claimant argues that the only sensible reading of Article 10.16.1 of the TPA is that the claimant must show either (i) that the claimant relied on an investment agreement to bring claims for breach of that investment agreement on its own behalf under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) or (ii) that the enterprise that the claimant owns or controls relied on an investment agreement to bring claims for breach of that investment agreement on behalf of that enterprise under Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C).749 The parallel mechanisms for investment agreement claims under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) and Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C) incorporate by reference and mirror the two types of investment agreements defined in Article 10.28; those to which a claimant is a party and those to which an enterprise is a party.750 The final paragraph of Article 10.16.1 of the TPA applies to both Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) and Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C) and provides that, to bring a claim for breach of the investment agreement, the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages must directly relate to the covered investment (here, the Concentrator) \"*that was established or acquired [\u2026] in reliance on the relevant investment agreement*.\u201d751\n\nClaimant's Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 106; Claimant's Memorial, \u00b6 297.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 297; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 276; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 98.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 276; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 86.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 276.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 87.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 282.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 283.\n\n625.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the terms of the TPA are clear. Article 10.16.1 nowhere establishes an additional reliance requirement that is not reflected in Article 10.28. In particular, these terms do not require reliance by the claimant for a claim it brings on behalf of the enterprise\u2014a requirement that does not exist in the definition of Article 10.28. Thus, to bring claims under Article 10.16.1(b), Freeport must show that the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages directly relate to the Concentrator that SMCV established or acquired in reliance of the 1998 Stability Agreement.752 According to the Claimant, the drafting history of Articles 10.16.1 and 10.28 of the TPA further confirms the Claimant's interpretation.753 The Claimant submits that Articles 10.16.1 and 10.28 are identical to the investment agreement provisions that the U.S. team proposed during the TPA negotiations and intended to have the same effect as the identical provisions in the 2004 U.S. Model BIT.754\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 283.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 284; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 93.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 284, referring to: Sampliner I (**CER-11**), \u00b6 44; Herrera I (**CWS-12**), \u00b6 38.\n\n626.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, contrary to the Respondent's argument, there is no temporal limitation unique to Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C) claims.755 The Respondent's claim that SMCV and the Concentrator are not \"*covered investments*\u201d under the TPA because they were not Freeport's investments at the time the TPA entered into force was brought forward only in the Respondent's Reply on Jurisdiction.756 Accordingly, it should be dismissed as untimely pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41.757 In any event, no provision of the TPA temporally limits investment agreement claims to those concerning an investment that the claimant or enterprise made in reliance on an investment agreement after the TPA entered into force. On the contrary, Article 1.3 of the TPA provides that \"*covered investment means, with respect to a Party, an investment, as defined in Article 10.28 (Definitions), in its territory of an investor of another Party in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter*.\u201d758 In addition, by adopting Article 10.28 of the TPA, the TPA parties intended to allow preexisting contracts to become investment agreements after the TPA entered into force in the same way they intended to allow preexisting investments to become covered investments.759 That intent is reflected in the MEF's opinion on the TPA stating that Chapter 10 applies to \"*existing investments as of the date of the entry into force*.\u201d760\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 94 *et seq*.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 94.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 94.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 95; TPA (**CA-10**), Article 1.3.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 97.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 97; MEF, Report No. 2006-EF/67, \"Opinion on the Free Trade Agreement with the United States of America\u201d dated 1 June 2006 (**RE-336**), p. 13 [Claimant's translation].\n\n627.\n\nWith respect to reliance, the Claimant argues that Phelps Dodge and SMCV relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement in making the covered investment, although the Claimant is not required to show that Phelps Dodge relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement.761 In response to the Respondent's argument that Phelps Dodge's reliance is not \"*an acceptable substitute*\u201d for Freeport's reliance, the Claimant submits that Phelps Dodge's reliance is compatible with the TPA.762 Like Freeport, Phelps Dodge was a U.S. investor. In any event, nothing in the TPA or its negotiation history supports the limitation that the Respondent suggests.763 Moreover, Phelps Dodge's reliance was a fact or behavior relevant to a legal right, *i.e.,* the right to submit investment agreement claims under the TPA.764\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 297; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 285; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 98 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 98-99.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 99.\n\nClaimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 100.\n\n628.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant submits that Cyprus initially acquired SMCV in reliance on Peru's guarantees of stability, which pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement and the Guaranty Agreement would be set out in, among others, future mining stability agreements.765 The Claimant also refers to the witness testimonies of Mr. Mor\u00e1n,766 Mr. Davenport,767 and Ms. Torreblanca,768 which *inter alia* stress the importance of the 1998 Stability Agreement to Phelps Dodge and/or SMCV. The Claimant adds that the 2004 Feasibility Study and the September 2004 update demonstrate that SMCV relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement in making the Concentrator investment, as the Study and update both explicitly assumed that the 1998 Stability Agreement would apply to the Concentrator.769 Moreover, the Claimant submits that SMCV's Board of Directors conditionally approved the Concentrator investment, \"*depend[ing] on obtaining the required permits* [*\u2026*] *necessary for the project*,\u201d including \"*the approval of SMCV's request to expand the Beneficiation Concession*,\u201d which the Board understood would result in the 1998 Stability Agreement covering the Concentrator by operation of law.770\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 297; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 101; Share Purchase Agreement dated 17 March 1994 (**CE-4**), Article 3.1(g); Guarantee of the Republic of Peru in Favor of Cyprus Climax Metals Company dated 17 March 1994 (**CE-341**), Article 1.6.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 297; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 101; Mor\u00e1n I (**CWS-8**), \u00b6\u00b6 14, 29.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 297; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 101; Davenport I (**CWS-5**), \u00b6\u00b6 30, 40.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 297; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 101; Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 27.\n\nFluor Canada Ltd., Feasibility Study: Cerro Verde Primary Sulfide Project dated May 2004 (**CE-20**), Vol. IV, pp. 14-16; Fluor, SMCV Primary Sulfide Project Feasibility Study Project Update dated September 2004 (**CE-459**), p. 48.\n\nSMCV, Board of Directors Meeting Minutes dated 11 October 2004 (**CE-470**), p. 1, \u00b6 1; Phelps Dodge 2004 10-K report (**CE-901**), p. 5; Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 27; Davenport I (**CWS-5**), \u00b6 40; Davenport II (**CWS-16**), \u00b6 17; Mor\u00e1n I (**CWS-8**), \u00b6\u00b6 26-29.\n\n629.\n\nFinally, the Claimant argues that the \"*subject matter of the claim[s] and the claimed damages*\u201d \"*directly relate*\u201d to Freeport's covered investments in SMCV and the Cerro Verde Mining Unit made in reliance on the 1998 Stability Agreement.771 The Claimant submits that the subject matter of Freeport's claims is Peru's breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement arising from its novel interpretation restricting stability guarantees to the Feasibility Study's investment program instead of granting them to SMCV for all investments in the Cerro Verde Mining Unit.772\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 299.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 299.\n\n**3. The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n630.\n\nThe NDP argues that each claim submitted by an investor must fall within either Article 10.16.1(a) or Article 10.16.1(b) and is limited to the type of loss or damage available under the Article invoked.773 Article 10.16.1(a) permits an investor to present a claim for loss or damage incurred by the investor itself, while Article 10.16.1(b) permits a claimant to present a claim on behalf of an enterprise of the other Party that it owns or controls for loss or damage incurred by that enterprise.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 3 *et seq.*\n\n631.\n\nThe NDP submits that Article 10.16.1 of the TPA imposes an additional condition on a claimant's claim of breach of an investment agreement, regardless of whether the claim is direct under Article 10.16.1(a) or on behalf of an enterprise under Article 10.16.1(b). For claims of breach of an investment agreement, a claimant must show a direct relation between the claim and the covered investment that was established or acquired in reliance on the relevant investment agreement. The TPA forecloses recovery for injuries that fall outside the scope of Article 10.16.1 of the TPA, including where the covered investment that is the subject of the claim was not established or acquired, or sought to be established or acquired, in reliance on the relevant investment agreement.774\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 6.\n\n**4. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n632.\n\nArticle 10.16.1(b) of the TPA provides in relevant part:\n\n*1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim*\n\n*(i) that the respondent has breached*\n\n*(A) an obligation under Section A,*\n\n*(B) an investment authorization, or*\n\n*(C) an investment agreement;*\n\n*and*\n\n*(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, provided that a claimant may submit pursuant to subparagraph (a)(i)(C) or (b)(i)(C) a claim for breach of an investment agreement only if the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages directly relate to the covered investment that was established or acquired, or sought to be established or acquired, in reliance on the relevant investment agreement.*775\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.16.1(b).\n\n633.\n\nThis provision sets forth a number of requirements that need to be met for a claim to be admissible. The Parties are in dispute as to two of the requirements of Article 10.16.1(b) of the TPA. Specifically, the Parties disagree on whether the 1998 Stability Agreement qualifies as an \"*investment agreement*\u201d under the TPA and whether the Claimant is required to have relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement when the covered investment was established or acquired, or whether it suffices that SMCV or, alternatively, Phelps Dodge relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement. The Tribunal will address each of these issues in turn.\n\n634.\n\nThe Tribunal first turns to the issue of whether the 1998 Stability Agreement is an \"*investment agreement*\u201d for purposes of the TPA. The Tribunal notes that Article 10.28 of the TPA defines \"*investment agreement*\u201d as\n\n*a written agreement between a national authority of a Party and a covered investment or an investor of another Party, on which the covered investment or the investor relies in establishing or acquiring a covered investment other than the written agreement itself.*776\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.28.\n\n635.\n\nThis definition requires (1) a written agreement, (2) between a national authority (3) and a covered investment or investor of another party, (4) on which the covered investment or investor relies in establishing or acquiring a covered investment other than the written agreement itself.\n\n636.\n\nWith regard to the first requirement, it is undisputed that the 1998 Stability Agreement is a written agreement.\n\n637.\n\nWith regard to the second requirement, this is also fulfilled as the 1998 Stability Agreement was concluded on the Respondent's side by MINEM, which is a national authority.777\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), p. 1.\n\n638.\n\nTurning to the third requirement, MINEM's counterparty to the 1998 Stability Agreement was SMCV. Article 1.3 of the TPA defines \"*covered investment*\u201d as an investment in the territory of a party of \"*an investor of another [p]arty in existence as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter*.\u201d778 Article 10.28 of the TPA further includes \"*enterprise*\u201d in its non-limitative list of investments covered by the TPA.779 SMCV is thus a covered investment because it is an enterprise that the Claimant owns or controls.780\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 1.3.\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.28.\n\nFreeport-McMoRan Inc., Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A., Corporate Organizational Chart dated 21 February 2020 (**CE-265**).\n\n639.\n\nWith regard to the fourth requirement, the Tribunal finds that SMCV relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement when \"*establishing or acquiring*\u201d the Concentrator. First, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant's contention that the \"*covered investment*\u201d established or acquired in reliance on the 1998 Stability Agreement is the Concentrator. In this regard, the Tribunal finds that there is tangible evidence that SMCV invested in the Concentrator on the premise that it could benefit from guarantees of the 1998 Stability Agreement. In particular, there is ample evidence demonstrating that SMCV invested in the Concentrator on the basis of the profit reinvestment guarantee of the 1998 Stability Agreement. For example, in a letter to MINEM in July 2003, Ms. Torreblanca explained that SMCV's decision to build the Concentrator \"*was directly related*\u201d to its right to reinvest non-distributed profits back into the project.781 The Tribunal disagrees with the Respondent's argument that SMCV and the Concentrator are not \"*covered investments*\u201d because the TPA had not yet entered into force at the time the investment was made. The plain wording of the definition of a \"*covered investment*\u201d under the TPA contradicts the Respondent's argument and shows that an investment could have already been in existence at the date of entry into force of the TPA. There is thus no basis to consider that there is a temporal limitation to investments covered by the TPA unique to Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C) claims.\n\nSMCV, Petition No. 1418719 to MINEM dated 3 July 2003 (**CE-394**).\n\n640.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the second issue of whether the Claimant is required to have relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement when the covered investment was established or acquired, or whether it suffices that SMCV or, alternatively, Phelps Dodge relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n641.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find anything in the wording of Article 10.16.1(b) of the TPA which would suggest that the Claimant is required to have relied on the investment agreement when the covered investment was established or acquired. In the Tribunal's view, should the TPA have required specifically the claimant's reliance, it would have expressly provided so by qualifying the reliance as such.\n\n642.\n\nRather, in the Tribunal's view, Article 10.16.1(b) of the TPA leaves open the question of whose reliance is required. This finding is in line with the definition of \"*investment agreement*\u201d in Article 10.28 of the TPA, which, as held above, defines the term as\n\n*a written agreement between a national authority of a Party and a covered investment or an investor of another Party, on which the covered investment or the investor relies in establishing or acquiring a covered investment other than the written agreement itself.*\n\n643.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the TPA clearly sets out that an investment agreement for the purposes of the TPA is an agreement, on which either the covered investment *or* the investor relies in establishing or acquiring a covered investment. Reliance for the purposes of Article 10.28 or 10.16.1(b) can thus either be established through the investor or the investment. In this case and as explained above, it is the covered investment, *i.e.,* SMCV, which relied on the 1998 Stability Agreement when making its investment in the Concentrator.\n\n644.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly also rejects the Respondent's objection based on Article 10.16.1(b) of the TPA as unfounded.\n\n**V. MERITS**\n-------------\n\n645.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question of the merits of the dispute.\n\n646.\n\nThe Parties are in dispute as to two key issues:\n\n- Did the Respondent breach the 1998 Stability Agreement?\n\n- Did the Respondent breach Article 10.5 of the TPA?\n\n647.\n\nIn what follows, the Tribunal will set out its analysis of these two issues and reaches by majority the conclusion that Peru has neither breached the 1998 Stability Agreement nor Article 10.5 of the TPA.\n\n**A. The Claimant's claim that the Respondent breached the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n648.\n\nThe Claimant brings claims on the basis of the 1998 Stability Agreement arguing that the 1998 Stability Agreement is an \"*investment agreement*\u201d for which the Claimant may bring claims under Article 10.16 of the TPA.782\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 289 *et seq.*; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 104 *et seq.*; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 8 *et seq.*\n\n**a) The Respondent's denial of stability guarantees on the basis of a novel interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement contrary to the Mining Law and Regulations**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n649.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent breached the 1998 Stability Agreement each time it denied stability guarantees to SMCV on the basis of its novel interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement, *i.e.,* an interpretation based on Mr. Isasi's June 2006 Report.783\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 300 *et seq.*\n\n650.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, under the plain text of the Mining Law and Regulations in force until 2014, stability guarantees applied to the entire mining unit or concession(s) in which the investor made its qualifying minimum investment without distinguishing whether the investments were included in the investment program in the feasibility study, different processing methods were used within the mining unit, or otherwise.784 In particular, the Claimant submits that the plain text of both the Mining Law (notably Articles 72, 80, 82, 83, and 84)785 and the Regulations786 (notably Articles 1, 2, 18, 22, and 25) made this clear.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 301 *et seq.*\n\nMining Law (**CA-1**).\n\nMining Regulations (**CA-2**).\n\n651.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Mining Law's drafters confirm that its provisions were intended to convey stability guarantees to the entire mining unit or concession in which an investor made its qualifying minimum investment. In this regard, Ms. Chappuis, who co-drafted the provisions in L.D. 708 which became Title Nine of the Mining Law, testifies that under the Mining Law, stability agreements cover \"*all investments*\u201d that a mining activity titleholder makes in its concession or \"*mining unit*.\u201d787 Ms. Vega, who consolidated L.D. 708 into the Mining Law, explains that the Mining Law provisions \"*alone and taken together, made clear that stability guarantees extended broadly to all investments that a mining company made within the concessions or unit covered by its stability agreement during the 10 or 15 years it is in force*.\u201d788\n\nChappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\nVega I (**CER-5**), \u00b6 34.\n\n652.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant submits that the Mining Law and Regulations also must be interpreted as having applied stability guarantees to all investments that a mining company makes within its mining unit because it is the only interpretation that is consistent with the Government's stated purpose of promoting private investment in the mining sector.789 The Claimant argues that promoting private investment in mining was the Government's primary objective in adopting the stability incentives that L.D. 708 introduced into the Mining Law.790 To accomplish this purpose, the Claimant argues that it is critical for stability guarantees to apply to the entire mining unit or concession, given the basic commercial realities of mining operations.791 The Claimant's expert, Mr. Otto, explains that stability guarantees are particularly important in the mining industry given that \"*[d]istinctive characteristics of mining\u2014such as high capital costs, long payback periods, and fixed assets\u2014make stability of the fiscal and administrative framework particularly important to a mining company's decision to invest*.\u201d792 The Claimant also argues that the individuals involved in preparing the Mining Law specifically understood that to promote investment in mining resources, stability guarantees had to protect an investor's entire mining unit or concession.793 Finally, according to the Claimant, international practice confirms that stability guarantees typically apply to entire mining units, since governments worldwide implement stability guarantees for the purpose of \"*attract[ing] investment*.\u201d794\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 308 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 309.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 310.\n\nOtto I (**CER-4**), \u00b6 17.\n\nVega I (**CER-5**), \u00b6 38;

As a matter of Peruvian law, a stability agreement must reflect the guarantees of the Mining Law, and therefore must be interpreted to be consistent with that framework, according to which stability was granted to the entire mining unit or concession.802 Clauses 9 and 10 of the 1998 Stability Agreement, which reflected the stability guarantees set out in the Mining Law, confirmed that stability extended to all of SMCV's activities in the Cerro Verde Mining Unit.803\n\n- The Stability Agreement guarantees benefits for the entirety of Cerro Verde's operations, including the Concentrator, because Cerro Verde operates as a single integrated mining unit made up of the Mining and the Beneficiation Concessions, both of which are explicitly covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement, as explained by Mr. Aquino.804 Moreover, because SMCV operated as a single mining unit with integrated operations, MINEM specifically endorsed the Concentrator's inclusion in the Cerro Verde Mining Unit, and hence the 1998 Stability Agreement, when the DGM preliminarily approved the expansion of the Beneficiation Concession to include the Concentrator in October 2004.805 According to the Claimant, the DGM's decision to grant SMCV's application to expand Cerro Verde's processing rights under the existing Beneficiation Concession, instead of under a new and separate beneficiation concession, leaves no doubt that the Concentrator, as part of the Cerro Verde Mining Unit, is covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement.806 The Claimant adds that MINEM's inclusion of the Concentrator within the existing Beneficiation Concession was entirely in line with the Government's consistent recognition of Cerro Verde as a single mining unit since the 1970s, and with its clear recognition of the need to develop a concentrator as part of Cerro Verde's integrated production unit.807 Finally, following the October 2004 provisional approval of the Beneficiation Concession expansion, the Government continued to confirm that SMCV's Concentrator was part of the Cerro Verde Mining Unit.808\n\n- The Government's own conduct confirms that stability applied to the entire Cerro Verde mining unit.809 In this regard, the Claimant contends that the Respondent's conduct prior to the Concentrator investment confirms that the Respondent understood that the Agreement would apply to the entirety of SMCV's Mining Unit.810 Moreover, according to the Claimant, the 2006 Roundtable Discussions attended by SMCV, Arequipa commissioners, and Government officials\u2014including Mr. Isasi and the Minister of Energy and Mines\u2014assumed that SMCV would not pay any royalties, including for the Concentrator, because the 1998 Stability Agreement applied to the entire Cerro Verde Mining Unit.811 Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the Government treated SMCV as fully stabilized with respect to the entire Cerro Verde Mining Unit during the preparation of the Voluntary Contribution and GEM812 programs.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 320 *et seq.*\n\nMining Law (**CA-1**), Article 86;

In any event, it is ultimately for the Tribunal to decide whether there has been a breach of the State's international law obligations under the umbrella clause.819\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 335 *et seq*.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 335 *et seq*.\n\nMining Law (**CA-1**), Articles 85, 101i; Vega I (**CER-5**), \u00b6\u00b6 33, 50(a); Mining Regulations (**CA-2**), Articles 18, 19.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 338; Chappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6\u00b6 22-24; Otto I (**CER-4**), \u00b6\u00b6 48-50; Vega I (**CER-5**), \u00b6\u00b6 50, 51, 53, 58.\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clauses 1.1, 1.2, 2, 3, and 4, Exhibit I; Bullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6 40.\n\nSMCV Supreme Court Appeal of the Appellate Court Decision No. 7650-2013, 2008 Royalty Assessment dated 23 February 2016 (**CE-138**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 340.\n\n656.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that to advance its novel and restrictive interpretation, the Respondent had to amend both the Mining Law and Regulations, confirming that the version in effect at the relevant time did not limit stability guarantees to the investment included in the feasibility study.820 In this regard, according to the Claimant, the 2014 amendment to the Mining Law, which expressly introduced a provision limiting certain stability agreements to the feasibility study's investment program, demonstrates that the 1998 version of the law that applied to SMCV did not implicitly contain this limitation, since the amendment would have otherwise been unnecessary.821 In addition, the Claimant submits that MINEM's December 2019 amendments to Article 22 of the Regulations similarly confirm that the previous version of the Regulations did not limit stability to the feasibility study's investment program, as it would have been unnecessary for MINEM to limit the scope of Article 22 in 2019 if the original text had already limited the stability guarantees to the investment program.822\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 341 *et seq.*\n\nMining Law (**CA-1**), Article 83-B; Promoting Economic Reactivation, Law No. 30296 dated 31 December 2014 (**CE-680**); Contentious Administrative Court, Decision, No. 07650-2013-CA, 2008 Royalty Assessment dated 17 December 2014 (**CE-122**), pp. 24-25, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33; Vega I (**CER-5**), \u00b6 52.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 021-2019-EM dated 28 December 2019 (**CA-246**), Article 22; Hern\u00e1ndez (**CER-3**), \u00b6 119; Vega I (**CER-5**), \u00b6 47.\n\n657.\n\nThe Claimant also argues that the Respondent's interpretation upends the basic purpose that the Mining Law's drafters sought to achieve in creating stability guarantees, *i.e.,* to offer investors a predictable tax and administrative framework.823 According to the Claimant, by their very nature, mining units require continuing investments over time and, thus, limiting stability guarantees to the investments in the feasibility study undermines the promotion of investment in mining resources.824 In addition, there are many costs and assets within an integrated mining unit that cannot be allocated in any obvious and reasonable manner to a specific investment. As a result, applying separate stability regimes to different investments within the same integrated mining unit under the Respondent's interpretation would be administratively burdensome, and would require extensive regulatory guidance to implement in a non-arbitrary manner.825 Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the Mining Law and Regulations were silent on how to allocate assets and costs between stabilized and non-stabilized investments within the same integrated mining unit, in contrast to allocating costs between different stabilized and non-stabilized concessions or mining units.826 Finally, the Claimant argues that the Government's own attempts to implement its interpretation against SMCV make it clear that the stability regime was never intended to operate with multiple regimes within the same unit, and that doing so is extremely difficult, as illustrated for example by the Respondent's treatment of the TTNA and Income Tax.827\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 344 *et seq.*\n\nOtto I (**CER-4**), \u00b6\u00b6 23, 34, and 50.\n\nOtto I (**CER-4**), \u00b6 52; Choque I (**CWS-4**), \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15, 33, and 34; Aquino I (**CWS-1**), \u00b6 57.\n\nMining Regulations (**CA-2**), Article 22; Otto I (**CER-4**), \u00b6 51; Choque I (**CWS-4**), \u00b6 33; Hern\u00e1ndez I (**CER- 3**), \u00b6 79.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 348.\n\n658.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that the Respondent's argument that the Peruvian Supreme Court decision in the 2008 Royalty Case of 18 August 2017 limits the Tribunal's consideration of whether Peru breached the 1998 Stability Agreement\u2014either as \"*collateral estoppel*\u201d or as a \"*prudential matter*\u201d\u2014are misconceived and unsupported.828 In this regard, the Claimant submits that it is not \"*collaterally estopped*\u201d from arguing that the 1998 Stability Agreement applied to the Concentrator. Referring *inter alia* to the *Caratube v. Kazakhstan* and *Amco v. Indonesia* tribunals, the Claimant submits that it is by no means settled that collateral estoppel is a general principle applicable in international arbitration proceedings.829 Even assuming that collateral estoppel may apply in international arbitration proceedings as a general principle of law, the Claimant argues that there is no basis for its application based on prior decisions of domestic courts. The Claimant submits that both the *Apotex v. United States* and *RSM v. Grenada II* cases referred to by the Respondent are inapposite because they either dealt with multiple international arbitration proceedings brought by the same claimant under the same treaty and raising the same claims or the preclusive effect of a prior international arbitration decision.830 Furthermore, the 2006 ILA Report referred to by the Respondent addressing the law of *res judicata* in the context of international commercial arbitration, discusses collateral estoppel (or issue preclusion) only in the context of considering the impact of a prior international arbitral award on a subsequent international proceeding.831 More generally, the Claimant argues that it is well-established that a domestic court decision does not have preclusive effect in international legal proceedings.832 The Claimant also states that the Respondent's claim that Freeport is \"*collaterally estopped*\u201d from advancing its claims in the arbitration\u2014 and its alternative argument that the Tribunal should \"*afford the Peruvian court decisions significant deference as a prudential matter*\u201d\u2014are an attempt to get around the fact that the Respondent cannot satisfy the Treaty's strict requirements for the narrow circumstances under which a claimant may be barred from raising certain claims that have already been litigated in a domestic proceeding under Article 10.18.4 of the TPA.833 The Claimant also argues that the Respondent is mistaken when it argues that \"*[a]bsent a denial of justice or due process violation [\u2026] [Claimant] is collaterally estopped from arguing that the 1998 Stability Agreement covers the Concentrator Project*\u201d or alternatively that \"*the tribunal should respect*\u201d the domestic court decisions.834\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 105 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 107, referring to: *Caratube International Oil Company LLP & Mr. Devincci Salah Hourani v.

Prof. Morales agrees with Prof. Bullard that preclusion only applies if the claims involve the same parties (*personae*), the same object (*petitum*), and the same cause of action (*causa petendi*).836\n\n- The Respondent agrees with the Claimant that the ruling of the Supreme Court in the 2008 Royalty Case has no precedential value in Peru.837 Thus, according to the Claimant, if the Supreme Court's decision has no precedential value, it does not provide Peruvian courts, much less the Tribunal, with a \"*definitive answer*\u201d on the proper scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n- The record demonstrates that neither the Supreme Court, nor the Tax Tribunal, nor SUNAT accorded any binding effect to the Supreme Court decision in the 2008 Royalty Case, including in interpreting the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement in subsequent proceedings. After the Supreme Court had rendered its decision in the 2008 Royalty Case, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in the 2006-07 Royalty Case. SUNAT and the Tax Tribunal did not seek dismissal on the grounds that the Supreme Court decision in the 2008 Royalty Case had *res judicata* or precedential effect.838 Moreover, the three justices voting to dismiss SMCV's appeal of the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments did not suggest that the Supreme Court decision in the 2008 Royalty Case was binding or otherwise dictated their votes, nor did the two justices voting to annul the decision of the Appellate Court. A total of 18 Tax Tribunal proceedings against SMCV arising out of the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement remained pending after the Supreme Court rendered its decision in the 2008 Royalty Case.839\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 112 *et seq.*\n\nMorales I (**RER-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 87-88; Bullard II (**CER-7**), \u00b6\u00b6 61, 65-70.\n\nBullard II (**CER-7**), \u00b6 71.\n\nSupreme Court, Decision, No. 18174-2017 (2006/07 Royalty Assessments) dated 20 November 2018 (**CE-739**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 118.\n\n660.\n\nThe Claimant concludes that as the Supreme Court's decision in the 2008 Royalty Case is incapable of having any binding effect, it also should not be accorded any weight by the Tribunal. The Claimant contends that unlike civil proceedings, the contentious administrative proceedings before the Supreme Court did not provide SMCV with an adequate evidentiary forum to make the case that the Claimant makes in this arbitration or that SMCV would have been able to make to support breach of contract claims in the civil courts. The Supreme Court did not have before it the evidence submitted in this arbitration including, among others: (i) the evidence of due process violations tainting the Tax Tribunal's resolutions under review; (ii) the fact and expert witness testimony concerning the Mining Law and Regulations; (iii) the full extent of the evidence concerning the Government's application of stability agreements to concessions and mining units; (iv) Mr. Isasi's April and September 2005 Reports; (v) the evidence of the political pressure on the Minister of Energy and Mines resulting in MINEM's volte-face; or (vi) expert witness testimony concerning the purpose of stability guarantees and their presumptive scope in international practice, among other matters. Moreover, less than one year after the Supreme Court's decision, the President of Peru recognized that the Supreme Court was part of a \"*system for administering justice*\u201d that had \"*collapsed*\u201d and needed sweeping anti-corruption reforms.840\n\n\"Peru sets referendum to 'legitimize' reforms after scandal\u201d, *AFP* dated 29 July 2018 (**CE-1016**); \"The Judiciary is perceived as the most corrupt in Peru\u201d *Semana Econ\u00f3mica* dated 29 October 2018 (**CE-1018**); \"Leaked calls reveal systemic corruption in Peru's judiciary, sparking flurry of resignations\u201d, *Washington Post* dated 20 July 2018 (**CE-1015**); \"Peru Judicial Branch declares three-month state of emergency\u201d, *Peru Reports* dated 16 July 2018 (**CE-1013**); \"Corruption in the Judicial System Surfaces in Phone Taps\u201d, *Peruvian Times* dated 10 July 2018 (**CE-1012**); GAN Integrity, Peru Corruption Report dated September 2016 (**CE-1005**).\n\n**b) The Respondent's breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n661.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent breached the 1998 Stability Agreement each time SUNAT's Royalty and Tax Assessments applying the non-stabilized regime to the Concentrator became binding and enforceable against SMCV.841 The Claimant states that the Respondent specifically breached (i) Clauses 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6, and the obligation to provide tax and administrative stability to SMCV;842 (ii) Clause 10.1, and the obligation to exempt SMCV from the application of any new laws or regulations that \"*directly or indirectly, denaturalize[d] the guarantees provided*\u201d by the 1998 Stability Agreement;843 and (iii) Clause 10.2, and the obligation to protect SMCV from \"*any encumbrance or obligation that could represent reduction of its availability of cash*.\u201d844\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 351 *et seq.*\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**) Clauses 9.4, 9.5, 9.6.\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clause 10.1.\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clauses 10.2, 9.4, 13; MINEM, Report No. 708-97-EM/DGM/OTN dated 30 December 1997 (**CE-356**); Chappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6 52; \"Peru: President Toledo Announces an Investment of US$850 Million in Cerro Verde\u201d, *Europa Press* dated 12 October 2004 (**CE-471**).\n\n662.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, each of the Respondent's breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement arose as of the date that the relevant Assessment became final and enforceable against SMCV. According to the Claimant, under Peruvian law, such breaches could only occur through administrative acts (*actos administrativos*) that were \"*final, definitive, and enforceable*,\u201d since prior to becoming final, definitive, and enforceable, there was no effect on SMCV's legal interests, no damage to SMCV, and the administrative authority could have reversed course at any time.845 According to the Claimant's legal expert Dr. Bullard, \"*[u]nder Peruvian law there is a breach of a contractual obligation when the debtor's conduct fails to deliver what it had promised,*\u201d *and \"in the case of stability agreements and the SUNAT assessments against SMCV, for the debtor's conduct to have failed to deliver what it had promised, the State must act or perform its conduct through final, definitive, and enforceable administrative acts*.\u201d846 The Claimant submits that SUNAT's Assessments became final and enforceable on either (i) the business day after SMCV was served with the Tax Tribunal resolution, for the Assessments it challenged before the Tax Tribunal; (ii) the business day after SMCV's deadline for submitting a challenge before SUNAT or the Tax Tribunal expired, for the cases where SMCV did not file a challenge before the Tax Tribunal or a request for reconsideration before SUNAT; or (iii) the business day after SMCV was served with the SUNAT or Tax Tribunal resolution accepting SMCV's withdrawal, for the cases SMCV withdrew.847\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 352; Bullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6 86.\n\nBullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 81-82.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez I (**CER-3**), \u00b6 41.\n\n663.\n\nThe Claimant disputes the Respondent's expert Mr. Morales' conclusion that the breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement occurred on the date they were notified to SMCV.848 According to the Claimant, at the time of notification, the Respondent had not yet actually applied to SMCV a regime different than the one it promised under the terms of the 1998 Stability Agreement. At the time of notification, the Respondent's own administrative authority could still have corrected its initial Assessment through the normal administrative process. At that date, the Respondent also could not yet have applied the non-stabilized regime to SMCV by enforcing SUNAT's assessments. Further, the Claimant contends that contrary to Mr. Morales's suggestion, SMCV could not have filed a claim for breach of contract before Peruvian courts upon notification of the SUNAT Assessments. Rather, as Prof. Bullard explains, SMCV could only have brought a claim for breach of contract once it actually suffered a pecuniary loss\u2014which only occurred once the Assessments became final and enforceable and SMCV had an enforceable obligation to pay the Assessments.849\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 123; Morales I (**RER-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 98-103.\n\nBullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6 89; Bullard II (**CER-7**), \u00b6\u00b6 83-85.\n\n664.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent also breached the 1998 Stability Agreement when it arbitrarily applied in certain Tax Assessments the non-stabilized regime to SMCV's entire mining unit, including to assets and activities that were stabilized even under Peru's interpretation.850 In particular, the Claimant asserts the following:\n\n- In the 2010 and 2011 Income Tax Assessments, SUNAT applied non-stabilized depreciation rates to certain assets without attributing them to the Concentrator.851 In the 2012 and 2013 Income Tax Assessments, it did so to all the assets that SMCV started using as of 2007, including some of the same leaching facilities' assets it had treated as stabilized in previous fiscal years.852\n\n- In the 2007-2013 Income Tax Assessments, SUNAT denied SMCV's income tax deductions for Profit-Sharing Obligation (**PTU**), expenses accrued in prior years, and recreational expenses, as well as deductions for payments that SMCV recorded using the classification system applicable under the 1998 Stability Agreement. SUNAT did so on a blanket basis without even attempting to identify which deductions related to the Concentrator.853\n\n- Even though the Respondent never denied that the 1998 Stability Agreement applied to the investment in the leaching facilities, SUNAT assessed the following taxes from which SMCV was exempted by operation of the 1998 Stability Agreement against the entire Cerro Verde Mining Unit: (i) 2009-2013 TTNA, (ii) 2007-2013 AIT, and (iii) 2013 CMPF.854\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 124 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 124; Choque I (**CWS-4**), \u00b6\u00b6 21-24; Spiller-Chavich I (**CER-1**), Table 54.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 124; Choque I (**CWS-4**), \u00b6\u00b6 21-24; Spiller-Chavich I (**CER-1**), Table 54.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 124; Choque I (**CWS-4**), \u00b6\u00b6 25-28; Spiller-Chavich I (**CER-1**), Table 54.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 124; Choque I (**CWS-4**), \u00b6\u00b6 29-32.\n\n665.\n\nAs with the Respondent's other breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement, the Claimant submits that these breaches occurred when the relevant Tax Assessment became final and enforceable.\n\n666.\n\nWhile the Respondent concedes that SUNAT applied the non-stabilized regime to the leaching facilities in these assessments, the Claimant notes that the Respondent attempts to place the blame for its arbitrary conduct on SMCV, asserting that SMCV \"*had to keep its accounts separate*\u201d and it \"*failed to do so*.\u201d855\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 391, 395.\n\n667.\n\nIn this regard, the Claimant first submits that it was not required to keep separate accounts for the leaching facilities because (i) under Article 22 of the Regulations, only mining companies with multiple concessions or EAUs subject to different legal regimes were required to keep separate accounts;856 and (ii) nothing in Article 22 required a mining company to keep separate accounts for individual investments within a857 concession.\n\nMining Regulations (**CA-2**), Article 22.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez I (**CER-3**), \u00b6\u00b6 71-73; Hern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6 18; Otto I (**CER-4**), \u00b6 40; Otto II (**CER-9**), \u00b6 31; Choque II (**CWS-15**), \u00b6 14.\n\n668.\n\nSecond, the Claimant notes that the Respondent admits that Peruvian law provided no official guidance on how SMCV should have distinguished between activities within its concession relating to the leaching facilities or the Concentrator.858 In this regard, the Claimant disputes the Respondent's contention that SMCV should have divided its accounting using an assortment of methods pulled from various unrelated strands of tax laws and regulations. Specifically, because the method used to divide SMCV's accounting was an integral part of the tax calculation, it had to be clearly and expressly established in the relevant tax laws and regulations.859 In addition, the Respondent itself recognized that there was no regulatory framework governing accounting for different activities within the same concession when it issued the December 2019 amendments to Article 22 of the Regulations.860 No such guidance existed at the time the 1998 Stability Agreement was in force.861 Furthermore, each of the methods that the Respondent's experts propose would have created serious implementation issues according to the Claimant.862\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 128.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 128 (a); Hern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6 17.\n\nSupreme Decree No. 021-2019-EM dated 28 December 2019 (**CA-246**), Article 22.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 128 (b).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 128 (c).\n\n669.\n\nThird, the Claimant avers that SMCV provided SUNAT with all its accounting information. Contrary to the Respondent's allegation that SMCV failed to provide information, SUNAT was not missing any of SMCV's accounting information; otherwise, it could not have issued any of the Royalty or SMT Assessments, which distinguished between the leaching facilities' and the Concentrator's activities.863 The Claimant submits that the Respondent fails to point to a single law or regulation that would have allowed SMCV to provide the information that SUNAT requested.864\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 129; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 390, 394, 398.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 129.\n\n**2. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n670.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the Claimant's claim on two grounds: first, the Claimant is barred by collateral estoppel from relitigating an issue that was decided under Peruvian law and is bound by the numerous adverse Peruvian court decisions (**a**); second, in any event, the Respondent did not breach the Stabilization Agreement (**b**).865\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 537 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 883 *et seq.*; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 28 *et seq.*, 300.\n\n**a) The Tribunal must respect the Peruvian court decisions**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n671.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Supreme Court and Superior Court analyzed the issues of Peruvian law that SMCV pled, and that the Claimant has now raised before this Tribunal and reached conclusions consistent with the Respondent's position in this arbitration. Those courts decided that, under Peruvian law, mining stabilization agreements only cover specific projects, and that, applying the same law, the 1998 Stability Agreement did not cover the Concentrator Project. Since under Peruvian law, the 1998 Stability Agreement did not cover the Concentrator, the Respondent's imposition of Royalty and Tax Assessments did not violate the 1998 Stability Agreement.866 According to the Respondent, this is fatal to the Claimant's breach of contract claims because first, the Claimant is collaterally estopped from re-litigating the issue, and second, even if that were not the case, the Tribunal still must apply Peruvian law to determine the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement, including the Peruvian Supreme Court's decision.867\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 893.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 894.\n\n672.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant is collaterally estopped from arguing that the 1998 Stability Agreement covers the Concentrator. The issue of whether the Respondent violated its obligations under the 1998 Stability Agreement turns on the scope of that Agreement, which is a question of Peruvian law that Peruvian courts, including the Supreme Court of Peru, have already answered.868 According to the Respondent, it is undisputed that the 1998 Stability Agreement is governed by Peruvian law.869 Absent a denial of justice or due process violation, SMCV and the Claimant proceeding on its behalf, is collaterally estopped from arguing that the 1998 Stability Agreement covers the Concentrator Project.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 541 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 888.\n\n673.\n\nThe Respondent submits that under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, \"*a question may not be re-litigated if, in a prior proceeding: (a) it was put in issue; (b) the court or tribunal actually decided it; [\u2026] (c) the resolution of the question was necessary to resolving the claims before that court or tribunal*\u201d;870 and (d) the current case involves the same parties or privies of those parties.871 Referring to *Apotex v. United States*, the Respondent submits that international tribunals have also applied forms of issue estoppel.872 According to the Respondent, all of the requirements for collateral estoppel are met with respect to the issue of whether the 1998 Stability Agreement covered the Concentrator.873 The Respondent argues that collateral estoppel applies to the Peruvian Superior Court and Supreme Court determinations that the 1998 Stability Agreement does not cover the Concentrator Plant. Specifically, the Superior Court found that, under the Mining Law and Regulations, \"*the contractual benefits arising from the Stability Agreement [\u2026] cover exclusively and inclusively the investment made in a specific mining concession, which allows to establish by logical inference that a future investment, subsequent to the date of conclusion of the contract, will not be covered by the benefits of the Stability Agreement signed before this latest investment*.\u201d874 The Supreme Court affirmed this decision and concluded that the 1998 Stability Agreement was limited to the investment project detailed in the 1996 Feasibility Study, *i.e.,* the leaching facilities.875\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 542; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 895, referring to: *RSM v.

Egypt* that \"*[w]hen [\u2026] a domestic tribunal has ruled on an issue of domestic law which subsequently has to be considered by an ICSID Tribunal, the ICSID Tribunal will have to take into account that the task of applying and interpreting domestic law lies primarily with the courts of the host country*.\u201d876 In addition, the Respondent submits that if the investor chooses to raise the same domestic law claims, such as a breach of contract claim, in a domestic court, and it loses, then absent some serious deficiency in the domestic court's decision (such as a denial of justice), the international forum is not meant to be a second bite at the same apple.877\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 905, referring to: *Helnan International Hotels A/S v.

According to the Respondent, this provision does not change the scope or content of the underlying contractual obligations, nor does it change the fact that the scope and content of such contractual obligations are governed by local, not international law.879 Peruvian law governs the 1998 Stability Agreement and if the Tribunal were to consider the merits of the Claimant's claims that Peru breached the 1998 Stability Agreement, the Tribunal would need to consider that question under Peruvian law alone. Such question was finally answered by the Peruvian Supreme Court and the Tribunal should not substitute its opinion on this Peruvian law question for that of the Peruvian Supreme Court.880\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 547 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 909 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 547, referring to: *WNC Factoring Ltd v.

The Claimant's contention that the Peruvian courts are wrong would only be relevant if the Supreme Court's decision was so erroneous as to be \"*clearly improper and discreditable,*\u201d which is the standard for a denial of justice claim, *i.e.,* a claim that the Claimant does not raise.881\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 549, referring to: *Mondev v. USA*, Award (**RA-6**), \u00b6 127.\n\n677.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's argument that the Supreme Court's decision in the 2008 Royalty Case is not precedential, the Respondent contends that while this is true to a certain extent under the Peruvian legal system, it is irrelevant for this arbitration's purposes. As the Respondent's expert Dr. Eguiguren explains, while the decision may not be precedential generally and *erga omnes*, it is binding on the parties to the dispute.882 According to the Respondent, regardless of whether the Peruvian Supreme Court decision is binding in other, future Peruvian legal proceedings, it is still conclusive evidence of how the Peruvian Supreme Court \"*would*\u201d (*i.e.*, \"*did*\u201d) interpret the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement as a matter of Peruvian law and there are no other final decisions from any other Peruvian court that has reached the opposite conclusion.883\n\nEguiguren I (**RER-1**), \u00b6\u00b6 99, 101.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 915.\n\n678.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent notes that although, as a general matter, it is for the Tribunal to decide whether Respondent has breached its international law obligations, Article 10.16.1 of the TPA is not an umbrella clause and does not impose on the parties to the TPA a substantive obligation to observe the commitments in, *inter alia*, investment agreements and thereby convert domestic law breaches of contract into international law Treaty violations. Article 10.16.1 of the TPA merely allows a claimant to bring certain breach-of contract claims into the investor-state forum and there is, thus, no \"*international law obligation[]*\u201d implicated here.884 Even if that were not the case, the Claimant's argument ignores the fact that the question of whether there was a breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement is governed by Peruvian law and has already been adjudicated at the highest level of the Peruvian judiciary. The Respondent refers to Professor Jan Paulsson, who confirms that \"*[t]he general rule is that the final word as to the meaning of national law should be left with the national judiciary*.\u201d885 The Respondent also refers to the *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates* annulment committee, which explained that \"*[a]n international tribunal's duty to apply [municipal] law is a duty to endeavour to apply that law in good faith and in conformity with national jurisprudence and the prevailing interpretations given by the State's judicial authorities. A State's [\u2026] law consists of its legislative and administrative provisions as well as the binding interpretations of those provisions by its highest court.*\u201d886\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 552; Claimant's Memorial, \u00b6 340.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 912; Jan Paulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law* (2005) (excerpts) (**RA-25**), p. 73.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 912; *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki v.

According to the Respondent, the stability guarantees apply to the specific investment project that is the subject of the 1998 Stability Agreement, *i.e.,* the Leaching Project, not to the entire concession(s).888 The only plausible interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement confirms that it applies to the investment project defined in the feasibility study (*i.e.* the leaching plant) and does not extend to the Concentrator Project. The Respondent, therefore, did not violate the 1998 Stability Agreement by imposing the Tax and Royalty Assessments on the Concentrator Project.889 This interpretation has been consistent as evidenced by:890 (i) Mr. Isasi's April 2005 Report,891 (ii) Minister S\u00e1nchez and Mr. Isasi's June 2005 presentation before the Energy and Mines Congressional Committee,892 (iii) MINEM's September 2005 Report893 and the October 2005 Letter,894 (iv) MINEM's November 2005 Letter and Minister S\u00e1nchez's public statements,895 (v) Mr. Isasi's May 2006 presentation before the Working Group for Cerro Verde Matters of the Energy and Mines Congressional Committee,896 and (vi) MINEM's June 2006 Report.897\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 555 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 886 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 887.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 557, 588.\n\nMINEM, Report No. 153-2005-MEM/OGAJ dated 14 April 2005 (**CE-494**), \u00b6 17.\n\nEnergy and Mines Congressional Committee, Congress of the Republic, Meeting Minutes dated 8 June 2005 (**RE-29**).\n\nMINEM, Report No. 385-2005-MEM/OGJ dated 22 September 2005 (**CE-512**).\n\nMINEM, Report No. 1725-2005-MEM/DM dated 3 October 2005 (**CE-515**).\n\nMINEM, Report No. 2004-2005-MEM/DM dated 8 November 2005 (**CE-519**).\n\nMINEM, \"Reinvestment of Profits and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated May 2006 (**RE-3**).\n\nMINEM, Report No. 156-2006-MEM/OGJ dated 16 June 2006 (**CE-534**).\n\n681.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Mining Law and Regulations provide that stability guarantees apply to the specific investment project only.898 According to the Respondent, stabilization agreements are limited to specific investment projects that have been carefully assessed and defined at the time the stability agreement is signed. In this regard, the Respondent submits that the legal framework applicable to stabilization agreements shows that the benefits granted through these agreements are limited to the specific investment project for which the agreement was signed. In particular:\n\n- Title Nine of the Mining Law documents the stabilization agreements' limited scope, and nothing in Title Nine of the Mining Law indicates that stabilization agreements grant benefits with respect to an entire Mining Unit, which is an administrative construct in order to group together mining concessions and other mining activities that share the same location.899\n\n- Articles 79 and 83 of the Mining Law provide that mining companies are only entitled to benefit from a stabilization agreement if they commit to make an investment for a minimum amount of funds and over a required amount of time.900 An \"*investment program*\u201d is a detailed description of the investment project that the mining company is going to make (including the schedule for the investment and the projected value of the investment to be made), which will be covered by the stabilization agreement.901 In the case of 15-year stabilization agreements, investment programs are included within a technical-economic feasibility study which is submitted to and approved by MINEM and is required in order to sign the stabilization agreement.902 Furthermore, the purpose of stability guarantees is to limit the risk to the investment project of changes to the legal regime and ensure that the investor's rate of return for that project is not affected by those changes. It is, thus, logical that the benefits granted by stabilization agreements apply exclusively to the investment project for which the agreement is entered into.903\n\n- Articles 79 (referring to 10-year stabilization agreements) and 83 (referring to 15-year stabilization agreements) of the Mining Law provide that \"*[t]he effect of the contractual benefit shall apply exclusively to the activities of the mining company in whose favor the investment is made*.\u201d904 Thus, the law specifically provides that the activities related to (\"*in whose favor*\u201d) the investment project that was made (*i.e.,* the investment project that was detailed in an investment program submitted to and approved by MINEM) are the ones that receive benefits from the stabilization agreement.\n\n- Other provisions in the Mining Law provide further evidence that the scope of the stabilization agreement is limited to the investment project described in the investment program.905 For example, the Mining Law provides that stability benefits only start taking effect once the mining company has completed the investment\u2014the investment that was detailed in the investment program. If it were the case that stability benefits would apply to any investment anywhere in the concession at any time, as the Claimant alleges, it would not be necessary to wait until the execution of a specific investment project to start applying the stability benefits.\n\n- The 1993 Mining Regulations are consistent with the Mining Law. In particular, Article 22 echoes the language of Articles 79 and 83 of the Mining Law, which provide that the benefits of a stability contract \"*shall apply exclusively to the activities of the mining company in whose favor the investment is made*.\u201d906 Article 22 of the 1993 Regulation provides that stability guarantees \"*shall benefit the mining activity titleholder exclusively for the investments that it makes in the concessions or Economic-Administrative Units*.\u201d907 Furthermore, Article 24 provides that the General Mining Directorate of MINEM must submit to the Office of the Vice Minister of Mines the Resolution that approved the feasibility study/investment plan, \"*which will serve as the basis to determine the investments that are the subject matter of the agreement*.\u201d908 The language in Article 24 is fatal to the Claimant's argument, because it provides that the investments detailed in the feasibility study\u2014not any eventual and undefined investments done within a concession or so called \"*mining unit*\u201d\u2014are the investments that are the \"*subject matter*\u201d of the agreement. Thus, all four articles limit the scope of stabilization agreements to the specific investment project.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 559 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 559; Polo I (**RWS-1**), \u00b6\u00b6 16, 29.\n\nMining Law (**CA-1**), Articles 79, 83.\n\nPolo I (**RWS-1**), \u00b6\u00b6 21-25.\n\nMining Law (**CA-1**), Article 85.\n\nPolo I (**RWS-1**), \u00b6\u00b6 12-14; Tovar I (**RWS-3**), \u00b6 62.\n\nMining Law (**CA-1**), Articles 79, 83.\n\nMining Law (**CA-1**), Articles 78, 82.\n\nMining Law (**CA-1**), Articles 79, 83.\n\nMining Regulations (**CA-2**), Article 22.\n\nMining Regulations (**CA-2**), Article 24.\n\n682.\n\nThe Respondent also submits that Mr. Polo proposed the key clause in dispute here regarding the scope of the stability guarantees and confirms that the Mining Law granted stability guarantees only to the specific investment project.909 The Respondent also notes that the Claimant's witness, Ms. Chappuis, agrees that this was the case.910 The Respondent further argues that Ms. Chappuis admits that the provision was intended to having a limiting effect when testifying that when drafting the provision \"*we wanted to make clear that stability would benefit only the concession or mining unit that was the target of the investment, to the exclusion of other mining units or non-mining activities that were part of the conglomerate but did not receive the investment directly*.\u201d911 Moreover, the Respondent contends that Mr. Polo's statement is also more convincing than Ms. Vega's understanding of the scope of the stability guarantees because while Ms. Vega drafted the 1992 TUO that consolidated L.D. 708 with L.D. 109, she did not determine the substance of either legislative decree.912\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 561 *et seq.*; Polo I (**RWS-1**), \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18-19.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 565.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 565; Chappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6 21.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 567; Vega I (**CER-5**), \u00b6 23.\n\n683.\n\nThe Respondent adds that it consistently applied stability guarantees in the manner it now argues.913 The Respondent submits that it did not change its interpretation of the Mining Law or the 1998 Stability Agreement, whether as a result of political pressure or for any other reason because there was no change. Rather, according to the Respondent, the June 2006 Report was entirely consistent with MINEM's interpretation as consistently expressed in various sources and on numerous occasions, for example: (i) Mr. Isasi's April 2005 Report, (ii) Minister S\u00e1nchez and Mr. Isasi's June 2005 presentation before the Energy and Mines Congressional Committee, (iii) the September 2005 Report and October 2005 Letter, (iv) the November 2005 Letter and Minister S\u00e1nchez's public statements, (v) Mr. Isasi's May 2006 presentation before the Working Group for Cerro Verde Matters of the Energy and Mines Congressional Committee, and (vi) the June 2006 Report. In this regard, the Respondent notes that the April 2005 Report explicitly states that \"*only the mining projects referred to in these agreements will be excluded from the royalty calculation basis*.\u201d914 In his May 2006 publicly-televised presentation to Congress, Mr. Isasi explained that \"*[s]tability is given to the investment project clearly delineated by the Feasibility Study and agreed upon in the Contract. It is not granted to the company generally or to the Concession*.\u201d915 In addition, (i) Mr. Isasi explains in his witness statement that his position has always been consistent,916 (ii) nothing in the Mining Council's resolution regarding the Parcoy Project could be understood as confirming the Claimant's view that stability benefits provided in the 1998 Stability Agreement extended to all investments in Cerro Verde's Mining Unit, including SMCV's investment in the Concentrator Project, (iii) SUNAT's Mr. Cruz never confirmed SMCV's understanding of the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement,917 and (iv) the Respondent did not confirm Claimant's understanding of the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement in the process of issuing the 2004 Royalty Law.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 568 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 569; MINEM, Report No. 153-2005-MEM/OGAJ dated 14 April 2005 (**CE-494**), \u00b6 17.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 569; MINEM, \"Reinvestment of Profits and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated May 2006 (**RE-3**), slide 8.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 570; Isasi I (**RWS-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 21, 55, 57.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 570; Cruz I (**RWS-7**), \u00b6\u00b6 19-22.\n\n684.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent submits that stabilization agreements do not need to extend to an entire mining unit to achieve their intended purpose.918 In particular, the Respondent submits in rebuttal of the Claimant's arguments:\n\n- Although the Respondent concedes that its goal was to promote private investment in the mining sector, this fact does not say anything about the limits or parameters of the Respondent's actions taken to further that goal (*i.e.*, the scope of the stability guarantees).919\n\n- The Respondent's international tax and mining expert Mr. Ralbovsky explains that the Claimant overstates the relative importance of stabilization agreements, or tax concerns generally, in an investor's decision of whether to invest.920\n\n- Article 82 of the Mining Law does not state that stabilization agreements are intended to cover the entire mining unit in which an investment is made.921.\n\n- Contrary to the Claimant's view, whether or not it is typical in international practice for governments to provide stability guarantees to an entire mining unit is irrelevant to interpreting the Mining Laws and Regulations applicable in Peru and, more significantly, the specific provisions in SMCV's Stability Agreement.922\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 572 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 573.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 575-576; Ralbovsky I (**RER-4**), \u00b6\u00b6 33-34.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 577-579.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 581.\n\n685.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent submits that the 1998 Stability Agreement expressly provides stability guarantees to the specific investment project identified in the 1996 Feasibility Study.923 The Respondent argues that the language of the 1998 Stability Agreement clearly applies the stability guarantees to the specific investment project identified in the agreement. For example:924\n\n- Clause 1 of the 1998 Stability Agreement provides the purpose (*i.e.,* to increase SMCV's production capacity of copper cathodes through the leaching of secondary sulfide ore) and defines the scope of the Agreement. Nothing in this text mentions a future investment in a concentrator plant to process primary sulfide ore (a different type of copper ore) to produce copper concentrate (a different product), which was the purpose of the investment made in 2004-2006 to build the Concentrator.\n\n- Clause 2 of the Agreement provides that the General Mining Directorate of MINEM approved the 1996 Feasibility Study on 6 May 1996, via Resolution No. 155-96-EM/DGM.\n\n- Clause 3 is not relevant to analyzing whether the Agreement covered the Concentrator Project.\n\n- Clauses 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 refer to the investment program that was included in the 1996 Feasibility Study and link the effects of the Agreement to the investment project that is outlined in that investment program (*i.e.* the Leaching Project).\n\n- Clauses 9 and 10 are irrelevant to analyzing the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement.925\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 582 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 583; 1998 Stability Agreement dated 26 February 1998 (**CE-12**).\n\n*See* Supreme Court Decision No. 5212-2016 (2008 Royalty Assessment) dated 18 August 2017 (**CE-153**), \u00b6 37, p. 34.\n\n686.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent's course of conduct was clear and consistent. In this regard, the Respondent disputes the Claimant's reliance on an internal 1997 MINEM memorandum discussing how the 1994 Stabilization Agreement could co-exist with the 1998 Stability Agreement.926 According to the Respondent, the Claimant insists that the memorandum explains that two tax regimes could not coexist within the same unit, while ignoring that MINEM, in a subsequent 1998 memorandum, abrogated both decision and reasoning in the 1997 memorandum.927 MINEM explained in the 1998 memorandum that both stabilization agreements were able to coexist because each contract was intended to protect a \"*different investment*.\u201d928\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 586;

it did not analyze or outline anything in relation to the Concentrator Project.933 According to the Respondent, the 1996 Feasibility Study, the report by the General Mining Directorate analyzing the 1996 Feasibility Study, and the Resolution approving the study all confirm that the investment project for which SMCV sought to obtain the 1998 Stability Agreement was exclusively for the expansion of SMCV's leaching facilities to increase the processing of secondary sulfides and production of copper cathodes.934\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 592 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 592 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 886.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 886.\n\n690.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent's amendments to the Mining Law and Regulations do not prove that the Claimant's interpretation under the previous law and regulations was correct.935\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 601 *et seq*.;

The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n694.\n\nIn analyzing the Respondent's alleged breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement the Tribunal will, first, determine the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement (**a**). Second, the Tribunal will turn to the issue of whether the 1998 Stability Agreement was breached (**b**).\n\n**a) The scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The applicable law governing the issue of the alleged breach of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n695.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that Article 10.22 of the TPA deals with the governing law of disputes.942 Article 10.22 of the TPA provides in relevant part:\n\n*[W]hen a claim is submitted under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(B) or (C), or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B) or (C), the tribunal shall apply:*\n\n*(a) the rules of law specified in the pertinent investment authorization or investment agreement, or as the disputing parties may otherwise agree; or*\n\n*(b) if the rules of law have not been specified or otherwise agreed:*\n\n*(i) the law of the respondent, including its rules on the conflict of laws, and*\n\n*(ii) such rules of international law as may be applicable.*943\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.22.\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.22(2).\n\n696.\n\nThe Parties agree that the law governing the issue of whether the Respondent breached the 1998 Stability Agreement is a matter of Peruvian law.944 Specifically, the Parties agree that the Mining Law and Regulations define the scope of stability guarantees.945 Their respective interpretations of the Mining Law and Regulations guide their interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement. In what follows, the Tribunal will thus first address the Mining Law and Regulations before turning to the text of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 300 *et seq*.; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 538.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 79; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 97.\n\n**(2) The applicable legal framework governing stabilization agreements in Peru**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n697.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, under the plain text of the Mining Law and Regulations in force until 2014, stability guarantees applied to the entire mining unit or concession(s) in which the investor made its qualifying minimum investment without distinguishing whether the investments were included in the investment program in the feasibility study, different processing methods were used within the mining unit, or otherwise.946 The Claimant bases its view *inter alia* on Articles 82 and 83 of the Mining Law, Articles 2, 22 and 25 of the Mining Regulations, the 2014 and 2019 amendments to the law, as well as the confirmation by the alleged drafters of the Mining Law that stability guarantees apply to the entire mining unit or concession.947\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 301 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 301 *et seq.*; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 34 *et seq.*\n\n698.\n\nIn contrast, in the Tribunal's view, it does not follow from the plain text of the Mining Law and Regulations that stabilization agreements should apply to entire \"*concessions*\u201d or \"*mining units*\u201d as the Claimant argues. To the contrary, the Tribunal finds that nothing in the Mining Law and Regulations provide for such a reading. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the term \"*mining unit*\u201d referred to by the Claimant is not defined in the Mining Law or Regulations, as acknowledged by the Claimant's expert Mr. Otto.948 Moreover, to the extent that the Claimant argues that the term \"*mining unit*\u201d should be equated with \"*Economic-Administrative Unit*\u201d, SMCV's Mining and Beneficiation Concessions have not been declared or qualified as an \"*Economic-Administrative Unit*\u201d by the DGM as required by the Mining Law, and the Tribunal is also not convinced that there existed a \"*de facto*\u201d Economic-Administrative Unit, as advanced by Ms. Torreblanca.949 The Tribunal further notes that nothing in the Mining Law and Regulations explicitly sets out that stabilization agreements should apply to entire \"*concessions.*\u201d\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 7, p. 2094, lines 10-11.\n\nGeneral Mining Law (**CA-1**), Article 44 (\"[...] *The grouping of mining concessions constitutes an economic-administrative unit and requires approving resolution from the Directorate General of Mining*.\u201d); Article 82 (\"[\u2026] *For the purposes of the agreement referred to in the preceding paragraph, the term Economic-Administrative Unit means the set of mining concessions located within the limits set forth in Article 44 of this Law, the processing plants, and the other assets that constitute a single production unit due to sharing supply, administration, and services, which in each case the Directorate General of Mining will qualify*.\u201d); Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 45; Claimant's Rejoinder, \u00b6 47(d); Hearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 431 line 5 to p. 437 line 14.\n\n699.\n\nRather, the Tribunal is of the view that benefits granted through mining stabilization agreements are limited to a specific mining project set out in the investment program in the feasibility study, as evidenced by the Mining Law and Regulations. Such mining projects have to be of a certain minimal capacity (Article 82 of the Mining Law) and of a certain minimal investment value (Article 83 of the Mining Law), the details of which are contained in a key document, *i.e.* the technical-economic feasibility study that has to be submitted to the DGM for approval (Article 85 of the Mining Law).\n\n700.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal turns to Article 82 of the Mining Law, which grants mining companies the possibility to enter into 15-year stabilization agreements. Article 82 provides:\n\n*In order to promote investment and facilitate the financing of **mining projects** with an initial capacity of not less than 5,000 MT/day or expansions intended to reach a capacity of not less than 5,000 MT/day referring to one or more Economic-Administrative Units, mining activity titleholders shall enjoy tax stability that shall be guaranteed through an agreement entered into with the State for a term of fifteen years, starting from the fiscal year in which the execution of the investment or expansion, as the case may be, is accredited.*\n\n*For the purposes of the agreement referred to in the preceding paragraph, the term Economic-Administrative Unit means the set of mining concessions located within the limits set forth in Article 44 of this Law, the processing plants, and the other assets that constitute a single production unit due to sharing supply, administration, and services, which in each case the Directorate General of Mining will qualify.*950 (emphasis added)\n\nGeneral Mining Law (**CA-1**), Article 82.\n\n701.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the language of Article 82 of the Mining Law makes clear that stability guarantees are granted to specific \"*mining projects*,\u201d be they new investment projects or expansion projects of existing operations, and not \"*concessions*,\u201d \"*EAUs*,\u201d or \"*mining units*.\u201d951 In the Tribunal's view, the reference to \"*Economic-Administrative Unit*\u201d and \"*concessions*\u201d in Article 82 merely means that stabilization guarantees are granted to mining projects that may be located within one or more mining concessions, as long as the project allows the mining company to produce at least 5,000 MT/day. In the absence of any clear wording to this effect, the references to \"*Economic-Administrative Unit*\u201d and \"*concessions*\u201d cannot thus be interpreted as meaning that substantive guarantees extend to an entire mining unit or concession(s) as the Claimant argues.\n\nSuch specific mining projects are also reflected in the Model Stabilization Agreement. A number of blanks were set out in Clause 1.1, in which the mining company wishing to enter into a stabilization agreement had to specify the name of the project, the concessions in which the project would be developed, and whether the project in relation to which the stabilization agreement had been requested was an \"*operational startup*\u201d or an \"*investment*\u201d (*i.e*., an investment to expand operations). See Model Stability Agreement, Supreme Decree No. 04-94-EM dated 3 February 1994 (**CE-778**), Clause 1.1.\n\n702.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this interpretation of Article 82 of the Mining Law is consistent with Article 22 of the Mining Regulations, which provides that \"*[t]he contractual guarantees shall benefit the mining activity titleholder **exclusively** for the investments that it makes in the concessions or Economic-Administrative Units*.\u201d952 (emphasis added)\n\nMining Regulations (**CA-2**), Article 22.\n\n703.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this provision, in particular through the use of the word \"*exclusively,*\u201d clearly limits the scope of stabilization agreements to a specific investment in a specific mining project, which has to be made within the concession or EAU. Again, the reference to concessions or EAUs in this provision only shows the location where investments are to be made. In this regard, Mr. Polo testified in his first witness statement that this \"*provision could not be clearer: stability guarantees apply to the investment that the mining company makes in a specific project*.\u201d953 In his second witness statement, Mr. Polo further indicated that \"*the concessions and the EAUs are the places where the investments are made and nothing else*.\u201d954\n\nPolo I (**RWS-1**), \u00b6 33.\n\nPolo II (**RWS-8**), \u00b6 20.\n\n704.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimant also bases its interpretation on the scope of stability guarantees on Article 2 of the Mining Regulations, in particular on wording that was introduced in a reform in 2019. However, the wording in force in 2019 cannot form the basis for the interpretation of the version in force at the time when the 1998 Stability Agreement was signed.\n\n705.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal turns to Article 83 of the Mining Law on which the Claimant also relies to support its interpretation on the scope of stabilization agreements. Article 83 provides in relevant part:\n\n*Mining activity titleholders who submit **investment programs** of not less than the equivalent in local currency of US$20,000,000.00 for the start of any mining industry activities shall have the right to enter into the agreements referred to in the preceding article.*\n\n*In the case of investments in existing mining companies, an investment program of not less than the equivalent in local currency of US$50,000,000.00 will be required.*\n\n*As an exception, persons who make investments of not less than the equivalent in local currency of US$50,000,000.00 in State-owned companies that are subject to the privatization process pursuant to Legislative Decree No. 674 shall have the right to access these agreements.*\n\n***The effect of the contractual benefit shall apply exclusively to the activities of the mining company in whose favor the investment is made**. (emphasis added)*\n\n706.\n\nThis provision specifies that depending on the type of investment project to be stabilized (*i.e.,* an investment to initiate operations or to expand existing operations), the investment has to be of a certain minimum dollar value. In order to benefit from a mining stabilization agreement, mining companies thus have to submit \"*investment programs,*\u201d which are included within the technical-economic feasibility study submitted to and approved by MINEM as per the terms of Article 85 of the Mining Law. Crucially, Article 83 of the Mining Law foresees that \"*[t]he effect of the contractual benefit shall apply exclusively to the activities of the mining company in whose favor the investment is made*.\u201d955 The Tribunal finds that the only way to give effect to the term \"*exclusively*\u201d in Article 83 is to interpret the provision as meaning that not all activities of a mining company are subject to stability guarantees, rather only those in relation to the undertaken mining project set out in the investment program. As explained by Mr. Polo, Article 83 \"*limit[s] the scope of stabilization agreements to the investment project contained in the investment program submitted by the mining titleholder and approved by MINEM*.\u201d956\n\nMining Law (**CA-1**), Article 83.\n\nPolo II (**RWS-8**), \u00b6 11.\n\n707.\n\nThe Claimant argues that an amendment to the Mining Law introduced in 2014 and creating Article 83-B would have been unnecessary if the original text of Article 83 had already limited the scope of 15-year stability agreements to the investments contained in the feasibility study.957 However, the Tribunal is of the view that the relevant wording to be interpreted is the wording of Article 83 in force at the time the 1998 Stability Agreement was signed, to the exclusion of future amendments to the law. The Tribunal is also of the view that the law in force at the time of the conclusion of the 1998 Stability Agreement already provided that the scope of stabilization agreements was limited to what was foreseen in the feasibility study, as stated above (see above, paras. 699 *et seq.*). The Tribunal notes that in the case at hand, MINEM approved the technical-economic feasibility study, noting that the objective of such study was \"*the production of approximately 105 million pounds per year of copper cathodes in Cerro Verde's facilities.*\u201d958\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 41 *et seq.*\n\nMINEM, Directorial Resolution No. 158-96-EM/DGM dated 6 May 1996 (**RE-24**), p. 1.\n\n708.\n\nHence, the Tribunal finds that the statement of reasons for the 2014 amendment to Article 83 clarifies what legal framework was in force before the amendment. The statement of reasons expressly states that: \"*pursuant to the legal framework in force, it would not be possible to stabilize pre-existing assets or investments, nor those investments that do not appear in the Feasibility Study that is attached to the [stabilization agreements], which could be unattractive for the owners of the mining activity who wish to expand their investments, as they would have to undergo a whole new procedure to stabilize the expansion*.\u201d959\n\nExecutive Power, Statement of Reasons for Bill No. 3627/2013-PE dated 2014 (**RE-50**), pp. 9-10.\n\n709.\n\nThird, the Tribunal turns to Article 25 of the Regulations, on which the Claimant also relies to support its interpretation. Article 25 of the Regulations provides:\n\n*Without prejudice to the Income and Corporate Assets Tax Returns which, according to the law, the mining activity titleholder must submit in cases of expansion of facilities or new investments that contractually enjoy the guarantee of legal stability, said titleholder must make available to the Tax Administration the annexes that demonstrate the application of the tax regime granted to the aforementioned expansions or new investments*.960\n\nMining Regulations (**CA-2**), Article 25.\n\n710.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Article 25 of the Regulations makes clear that stability benefits extend to the entire mining unit or concession, rather than to a specific investment, because it acknowledges that a mining company could undertake \"*expansion of facilities or new investments that contractually enjoy the guarantee of legal stability*.\u201d961 However, the Tribunal finds that such provision only foresees that while expansions or new investments may in given circumstances benefit from stabilization guarantees, such guarantees are not automatically granted to a mining company by virtue of its location within a \"*mining unit*\u201d or \"*concession*\u201d as the Claimant argues. This is confirmed by the testimony of Mr. Polo, who stated that \"*the reference to 'expansions or new investments' refers to investments made by pre-existing mining companies (expansions) and companies that had not made an investment (new investments) and that allowed those companies to enter into 15-year stabilization agreements\u2014if they met the minimum amounts required*.\u201d962 Rather, a mining company must submit \"*the annexes that demonstrate the application of the tax regime granted to the [\u2026] expansions or new investments*.\u201d963 In the case at hand, the Claimant has not demonstrated that it has done so.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 304(e); Mining Regulations (**CA-2**), Article 25.\n\nPolo II (**RWS-8**), \u00b6 26.\n\nMining Regulations (**CA-2**), Article 25.\n\n711.\n\nOther provisions of the Mining Regulations further confirm the Tribunal's view that stability guarantees solely apply to a specific mining project and not to the entire mining unit or concession:\n\n- The Mining Regulations provide that a mining titleholder must prepare a detailed feasibility study or investment plan in order to apply for a stabilization agreement. It follows from Article 18 of the Regulations that a mining company must submit a feasibility study to apply for stability benefits. Pursuant to Article 19 of the Regulations, such feasibility study must include a certain amount of mandatory information, including, a detailed description of, *inter alia*: (i) all the works to be performed, (ii) the term, execution schedule, and amount of the investment project, (iii) the minimum amount of production expected to be obtained from the investment, (iv) the projected sales volumes and prices for the final products produced from the investment, and (v) the profitability of the project. The Tribunal finds that if it were the case that the stabilization agreement applied automatically to any investment done within a concession or mining unit, then the State would not request detailed information only about the original investment project.\n\n- The Mining Regulations further make clear that a stabilization agreement benefits the activities related to the investment project that is described in that feasibility study or investment plan. Article 24 provides that the DGM must submit to the Vice-Minister of Mines the resolution approving the feasibility study which will serve as the basis to determine \"*the investments set out in the agreement*\u201d (the Claimant's translation) or \"*the investments that are the subject matter of the agreement*\u201d (the Respondent's translation). Irrespective of which translation is to be preferred, the Tribunal finds that this provision makes clear that not any investments made within a \"*concession*\u201d or \"*mining unit*\u201d may benefit from stabilization. Rather, the feasibility study defines the investments that may benefit from stabilization.\n\n712.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to the testimony of Ms. Chappuis and Ms. Vega, who allegedly played a key role in the drafting of L.D. 708 and the Mining Law. At the Hearing, Ms. Chappuis asserted that she \"*wrote, together with Mr. C\u00e9sar Polo, all or most of the Articles in Legislative Decree 708, especially those having to do with the Tax Stability Agreements*.\u201d964 Ms. Vega explained in her expert report that she \"*prepared [\u2026] the Single Unified Text [which] became Peru's consolidated General Mining Law*.\u201d965 Ms. Chappuis testifies that under the Mining Law, stability agreements cover \"*all investments*\u201d that a mining activity titleholder makes in its concession or \"*mining unit*.\u201d966 Ms. Vega explains that the Mining Law provisions \"*alone and taken together, made clear that stability benefits extended broadly to all investments that a mining company made within the concessions or unit covered by its stability agreement during the 10 or 15 years it is in force*.\u201d967\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 841, lines 13-15.\n\nVega I (**CER-5**), \u00b6 5.\n\nChappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\nVega I (**CER-5**), \u00b6 34.\n\n713.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the testimonies of Ms. Chappuis and Ms. Vega are inconclusive and contradicted by both the testimony of Mr. Polo,968 who was undisputedly one of the key drafters of L.D.708 and the Mining Law, as well as the plain text of the law.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 1230, line 21 to 1232, line 1.\n\n714.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal notes that at the Hearing, the Claimant's expert Mr. Otto testified that there was an international \"*presumption that stability applies to all activities with[in] an integrated Mining Project*.\u201d969 However, such alleged presumption is unsupported by conclusive documentary evidence and even if such an \"*worldwide presumption*\u201d existed, this does not change the Peruvian law.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 7, p. 2108, lines 5-16; Hearing Transcript, Day 7, p. 2121, line 21 to p. 2122, line 3.\n\n715.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that its interpretation of the Mining Laws and Regulations is not contrary to the Government's stated purpose of \"*promot[ing] private investment*\u201d in the mining sector. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant's expert Mr. Otto explained that stability guarantees are important in the mining industry given that \"*[d]istinctive characteristics of mining\u2014such as high capital costs, long payback periods, and fixed assets\u2014make stability of the fiscal and administrative framework particularly important to a mining company's decision to invest*.\u201d970 However, the Tribunal does not find limiting stability guarantees to specific mining projects to be contrary to the promotion of private investment. Rather, as explained by Mr. Ralbovsky, \"*[i]n the case of stability agreements in the mining sector like in the instant case, countries offer tax incentives to mining companies and thus give up important government revenue, in exchange for the investments that the mining companies will bring to the countries*.\u201d971\n\nOtto I (**CER-4**), \u00b6 17.\n\nRalbovsky I (**RER-4**), \u00b6 36.\n\n716.\n\nFinally, for the sake of completeness, the Tribunal addresses the Claimant's argument that there was allegedly an administrative practice to apply stability guarantees to entire concessions or mining units.972 Contrary to the Claimant's argument, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not shown that there was a clear administrative past practice and understanding that all future investments made in a given concession would be covered by a stabilization agreement. In particular:\n\n- The Claimant refers to alleged repeated references by SUNAT to \"*mining units and concessions*\u201d or \"*production units*.\u201d973 The Claimant also refers to a form letter sent in 2005 by Haraldo Cruz, SUNAT's Regional Intendent for Arequipa, to SMCV referring to it as a \"*holder[] of [a] mining concession[]*\u201d with instructions on how to submit certain information about its \"*Production Unit(s).*\u201d The Claimant alleges that this would have confirmed that the mining unit and concessions were the relevant item for purposes of stability.974 However, the Tribunal finds that the exhibit referred to by the Claimant only shows that SUNAT sent form letters to holders of mining concessions, as these were the addressees of the Royalty Law. This did not entail that the Respondent viewed the \"*concessions and mining units*\u201d or \"*production units*\u201d as relevant factors in interpreting the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n- The Claimant further refers to exchanges at the end of 2007 between SUNAT and MINEM.975 The Tribunal does not find that these documents shed any light on MINEM's or SUNAT's interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement nor on the interpretation of the Royalty Law that would support the Claimant's position.\n\n- The Claimant also refers to the Parcoy Mining Council Resolution of November 2001 to argue that other mining companies relied on the second paragraph of Clause 3 of the 1998 Stability Agreement to request the extension of their stability agreements to additional concessions and mining units.976 As a threshold matter, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not asserted or otherwise proven that it relied on the interpretation of the Mining Council to found its expectation that the 1998 Stability Agreement was to be interpreted according to the Claimant's view. In any event, the Tribunal finds that the Resolution does not support the Claimant's interpretation of mining stabilization agreements. In that case, the mining company had requested the DGM to include \"*other mining rights*\u201d within the scope of an existing stabilized project.977 As the Respondent submits, the question before the Mining Council was whether ore retrieved from additional mining sites not named in the agreement could be processed in the stabilized project and benefit from its stability guarantees,978 which is a different question from the one at hand. The Tribunal finds that the 2001 Mining Council Resolution is not a request for the expansion of a stabilization agreement to a new and separate project. Accordingly, the 2001 Mining Council Resolution does not support the Claimant's interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n- The Claimant also refers to the Tintaya Resolution of January 2003 to submit that Tintaya's stability agreement in relation to its sulfides plant clearly covered the concession or mining unit.979 However, the Tribunal finds that this Resolution only confirms that two different stability agreements could apply to the same mining company.\n\n- Moreover, the Tribunal is convinced that there has been a practice of having mining concessions with both stabilized and non-stabilized projects, which contradicts the Claimant's position that stability guarantees should apply to entire mining concessions. Such examples include Tintaya,980 Yanacocha981 and Southern Peru.982\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 313 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 318(a); Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 69(a).\n\nSUNAT, Letter to SMCV dated 17 February 2005, (**CE-482**), p. 1.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 318(b); Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 69(d); SUNAT, Report No. 261-2007-SUNAT/2E0000 dated 20 November 2007 (**CE-568**); MINEM, Report No. 1169-2007-MEM-DGM dated 14 December 2007 (**CE-570**), pp. 1-2.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 84(c); MINEM, Resolution No. 380-2001-EM-CM dated 16 November 2001, (**CE-377**).\n\nMINEM, Resolution No. 380-2001-EM-CM dated 16 November 2001, (**CE-377**), p. 1.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 135; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 317; MINEM, Resolution No. 380-2001-EM-CM, dated 16 November 2001, (**CE-377**), p. 3.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 66; MINEM, Report No. 019-2003-EM-CM dated 20 January 2003 (**CE-882**).\n\nMINEM, Report No. 019-2003-EM-CM dated 20 January 2003 (**CE-882**).\n\nMinera Yanacocha S.A. - Proyecto Cerro Yanacocha Stabilization Agreement dated 16 September 1998 (**CE-919**); Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Yanacocha S.A. - Proyecto Yanacocha-Carachugo Sur Stabilization Agreement dated 19 May 1994 (**CE-911**); Agreement of Guarantees and Measures for the Promotion of Investments, Compa\u00f1\u00eda Minera Yanacocha S.R.L. - Project La Quinua Stabilization Agreement dated 25 July 2003 (**RE-189**).\n\nSouthern Peru Copper Corporation Stabilization Agreement dated 12 July 1994 (**CE-912**).\n\n717.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that under the Mining Laws and Regulations, stability guarantees applied to the entire mining unit or concession(s). Rather, as set out above, the Tribunal is convinced that the Mining Law and Regulations limit the scope of stability guarantees to specific mining projects set out in the investment program in the feasibility study.\n\n**(3) The 1998 Stability Agreement**\n------------------------------------\n\n718.\n\nHaving analyzed the applicable legal framework governing stabilization agreements in Peru, the Tribunal now turns to the 1998 Stability Agreement concluded by SMCV and Peru in 1998.\n\n719.\n\nWith regard to the applicable rules of contract interpretation, the Parties and their respective experts agree that Peruvian legislation has not established a sequence of prioritization among contractual rules of interpretation, but that the starting point of such interpretation must be the literal text of the contract, followed by a systemic analysis of the contract as a whole, and a contextual interpretation of the contract.983\n\nBullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6 23; Morales I (**RER-2**), \u00b6 50.\n\n720.\n\nThe Parties and their experts disagree as to whether the *contra proferentem* interpretation is relevant in the case at hand.984\n\nBullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 70 *et seq.*; Eguiguren I (**RER-1**), \u00b6\u00b6 46 *et seq.*; Morales I (RER-2), \u00b6\u00b6 39 *et seq.*\n\n721.\n\nThe Tribunal will thus address the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement on the basis of the agreed upon methods of contract interpretation, before determining whether it has to decide whether the *contra proferentem* rule is relevant in the case at hand.\n\n722.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note that the Appellate Court and Supreme Court of Peru have decided on the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement in the 2008 Royalty Case and expressed their view on the Mining Law and Regulations.985 However, these decisions only concern the 2008 Royalty Case and, as a matter of Peruvian law, do not serve as binding precedent, as ultimately agreed by both Parties' experts.986 Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that these decisions have no preclusive effect on the Tribunal and the Tribunal itself has to interpret the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement and to determine whether it was breached by Peru.\n\nAppellate Court Decision No. 7650-2013 dated 29 January 2016 (**CE-137**); Supreme Court Decision No. 5212-2016, 2008 Royalty Assessment dated 18 August 2017 (**CE-153**).\n\nBullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6 76; Bullard II (**CER-7**), \u00b6 71; Eguiguren I (**RER-1**), \u00b6 100; Morales I (**RER-2**), \u00b6 86.\n\n**(4) The literal interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n723.\n\nAccording to the Peruvian law rule of literal interpretation of the contract, the Tribunal must interpret the 1998 Stability Agreement \"*according to what has been expressed*.\u201d987 As a starting point, the Tribunal notes that nothing in the 1998 Stability Agreement expressly provides that the stability guarantees apply to all investments made within the Mining Concession and the Beneficiation Concession and no reference is made to a potential future investment in a concentrator. Rather, the Agreement exclusively refers to the \"*leaching project*\u201d of Cerro Verde. More particularly, Clauses 1, 3, and 4 of the 1998 Stability Agreement exclusively refer to the Leaching Project and do not reflect a common intent to extend stability benefits to any and all investments that SMCV could make within its concessions, as further set out below.\n\nPeruvian Civil Code (**CA-39**), Article 168.\n\n724.\n\nClause 1 of the 1998 Stability Agreement sets out the relevant background of the investment. The Stability Agreement concerned a USD 237 million investment project to expand the production capacity of the leaching plant from 72 million pounds of copper cathodes per year to 105 million pounds, *i.e.,* \"*[t]he leaching project of Cerro Verde*\u201d as set out in Clause 1 of the 1998 Stability Agreement.988\n\n1998 Stability Agreement dated 26 February 1998 (**CE-12**), Clause 1.1.\n\n725.\n\nClause 1.1 specifically provides that SMCV requested a mining stabilization agreement \"*in relation [to] the investment in its concession: Cerro Verde No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 [\u2026] 'The leaching project of Cerro Verde*.'\u201d989\n\n1998 Stability Agreement dated 26 February 1998 (**CE-12**), Clause 1.1.\n\n726.\n\nClause 1.3 provides the objective of the feasibility study and describes the purpose of the Leaching Project. According to Clause 1.3, \"*[t]he objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility to extend the production capacity from 72,000,000 to 105,000,000 lbs. (48,000 MT) of Copper cathodes per year coming from the heap leaching of the copper mineral in the facilities of Cerro Verde with recovery of 65%, that will be installed with the necessary equipment to improve the leaching of the secondary sulfides using the last technology and at the same time increase the production*.\u201d990 Furthermore, the 1996 Feasibility Study clearly sets out that the investment to be made at Cerro Verde concerned \"*[t]he Cerro Verde leaching project*.\u201d991\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clause 1.3.\n\nFeasibility Study, Executive Summary dated 1996 (**CE-9**), pp. 2-3.\n\n727.\n\nSuch wording clearly delimits the stabilization guarantees to \"*the investment*\u201d set out in SMCV's request for a mining stabilization agreement to MINEM, as detailed in the Feasibility Study, and specifically refers to \"*the leaching project of Cerro Verde*.\u201d Nothing in this wording shows that investments unrelated to \"*the leaching project of Cerro Verde,*\u201d such as the Concentrator, could benefit from the guarantees of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n728.\n\nThe Tribunal finds the lack of express references to the Concentrator Project and the exclusive references to the Leaching Project in the 1998 Stability Agreement to be decisive. The Leaching Project is described with precision in Clause 1.3 and the Feasibility Study. The Concentrator Plant, which uses different ore, different processes, and produces different products than the Leaching plant does not fall under the ambit of the \"*Leaching project*.\u201d Tellingly, the Claimant's own witness Mr. Davenport stated during the Hearing that the exclusive reference to the \"*leaching project*\u201d in Clause 1.1 was \"*the elephant in the room*\u201d for Phelps Dodge.992 In addition, the Tribunal notes that when SMCV sought to refer to the Concentrator in its correspondence with MINEM, it specifically referred to the \"*Primary Sulfide Project*\u201d993 and not the \"*Leaching project*.\u201d\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 770, lines 12- 20.\n\nSee for example: SMCV, Petition No. 3616468 to MINEM dated 28 January 2004 (**CE-421**), p. 3; MINEM, Report No. 841-2004-MEM/DGM/PDM dated 30 November 2004 (**CE-479**).\n\n729.\n\nNothing else follows from Clause 3 and Exhibit I to the Stability Agreement.\n\n730.\n\nClause 3 relates to \"*mining rights.*\u201d Clause 3 specifically provides:\n\n*According to what is expressed in 1.1, the Leaching Project of Cerro Verde is circumscribed to the concessions, related in EXHIBIT I, with the corresponding areas.*\n\n*What is provided in the above paragraph does not prevent the owner from incorporating other mining rights to the Cerro Verde Leaching Project, after approval by the General Direction of Mining.*994\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clause 3.\n\n731.\n\nThe first paragraph of this provision includes cross-references to Clause 1, reproduced above, and Exhibit I. Exhibit I provides as follows:\n\n*With respect to the mining concession of Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A. it is located in the district of Uchumayo, province and Department of Arequipa. NAME EXTENSION*\n\n*HAS.*\n\n*Cerro Verde No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 - 7,455*\n\n*CONCESSION OF BENEFICIATION*\n\n*The beneficiation Plant with a capacity of 33,000 M/Day is located in the district of Uchumayo, Province and Department of Arequipa.*\n\n*NAME EXTENSION*\n\n*HAS.*\n\n*'CERRO VERDE BENEFICIATION PLANT' 463*995\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Exhibit I.\n\n732.\n\nExhibit I of the 1998 Stability Agreement describes the location of the concession in which the Leaching Project will be carried out.\n\n733.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Clause 3, including its cross-references to Clause 1 and Exhibit I, cannot be interpreted to mean that any and all investments that SMCV made in the mining concession \"*Cerro Verde No. 1, No. 2, and No. 3*\u201d and the \"*Cerro Verde Beneficiation Plant*\u201d would be covered by the stability guarantees. No clause of the Agreement specifies that all investments that might be made within the concession shall be part of the \"*Leaching Project*\u201d covered by the stabilization guarantees. Rather, Clause 3 identifies the location of the concession, as evidenced by the word \"*circumscribed*,\u201d which can only mean that the Leaching Project is geographically located within the limits of the concessions.\n\n734.\n\nMoreover, the second paragraph of Clause 3 allowed SMCV to incorporate additional mining rights in relation \"*to the Cerro Verde Leaching Project,*\u201d as further elaborated in Clause 4. It does not define the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement, as the Claimant argues. It also did not imply that SMCV could add new unrelated investments under the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement or bring new mining rights within the Leaching Project without the DGM's approval.\n\n735.\n\nClause 4 of the 1998 Stability Agreement describes the plan of investments and the term of execution. In particular, it (i) provides that the Feasibility Study's investment plan, which is annexed to the Agreement, must be duly approved in order to implement the Stabilility Agreement996 (ii) describes the mechanism that SMCV must follow in order to request a modification or expansion of the investment plan so that the investments will be included in such plan,997 (iii) includes a list of the \"*works contained in the Investment plan*,\u201d998 and (iv) describes the expectation resulting from the investment plan, *i.e.,* that \"*during the period of the contract an approximate additional production of 15,000 MT per year of copper cathodes*\u201d999 be added. Again, this wording, limiting the product to copper *cathodes*, only refers to the Leaching Project.\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clause 4.1.\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clause 4.2.\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clause 4.3.\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clause 4.4.\n\n736.\n\nThe fact that certain changes of the investment plan could be implemented \"*provided the final object of the investment plan is not affected*\u201d1000 further proves that modifications of the investment plan had to be related to the initial object of the investment.\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clause 4.2.\n\n737.\n\nThus, a literal interpretation of Clauses 1, 3, and 4 as well as Exhibit I confirms that while SMCV could expand the scope of the Leaching Project, it could not include a new investment project, such as the Concentrator, within the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n**(5) The systematic interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n738.\n\nUnder a systematic interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement, according to Peruvian law, the Tribunal must interpret the clauses of the Agreement \"*by means of each other, attributing, in the case of doubts, the meaning that results from all of them as a whole*.\u201d1001 The Parties' experts agree that the 1998 Stability Agreement is governed by the Mining Law and Regulations and, thus, the 1998 Stability Agreement must be interpreted according to what is provided for in this framework.1002\n\nPeruvian Civil Code (**CA-39**), Article 169.\n\nBullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 35 *et seq*; Morales I (**RER-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 59 *et seq.*\n\n739.\n\nAccording to the Claimant and its expert Dr. Bullard, a systematic interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement's clauses, in particular Clauses 9 and 10, and the Mining Law and Regulations confirms that the stability guarantees covered all investments that SMCV made in its concessions during the stabilized term.1003\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 324; Bullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 36 *et seq*.\n\n740.\n\nThe Tribunal disagrees.\n\n741.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant's expert Dr. Bullard has expressed his opinion \"*assum[ing] that the Mining Law and Regulations [\u2026] provided that stability guarantees applied to all the concessions or the entire mining unit in which the titleholder made the minimum investment required to be entitled to enter into a mining stability agreement*.\u201d1004 However, this factual premise of Dr. Bullard's opinion is wrong, as set out above (cf. paras. 698 *et seq*.).\n\nBullard I (**CER-2**), \u00b6 16.\n\n742.\n\nSecond, neither Clause 9 nor 10 confirm the Claimant's understanding of the 1998 Stability Agreement:\n\n- Clause 9 grants SMCV the guarantees of the 1998 Stability Agreement \"*in accordance with articles 72, 80 and 84 of the [Mining Law] and article 14, 15, 16, 17 and 22 of the Regulations.*\u201d As discussed above, the Mining Law and Regulations do not extend stability guarantees to entire mining units or concessions as the Claimant argues. Rather, they limit such guarantees to the specific investment project detailed in the feasibility study or investment plan, *i.e.,* in this case, the Leaching Project.\n\n- Clause 10 regulates the effects of new legal provisions coming into effect after the date of approval of the Feasibility Study. It does not expand the 1998 Stability Agreement's scope.\n\n743.\n\nRather, the Tribunal finds that a systematic interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement leads likewise to the conclusion that only the Leaching Project was covered by the Stability Agreemeent:\n\n744.\n\nFirst, the term of the 1998 Stability Agreement was tied to the execution of the mining project.1005 In the Tribunal's view, if the effects of the 1998 Stability Agreement were to extend to unrelated projects such as the Concentrator, there would have been no need to wait until the completion of the investment to allow the effects of the 1998 Stability Agreement to commence.\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clauses 6.1, 7.1, 8.1.\n\n745.\n\nSecond, the 1998 Stability Agreement confirms that only the investments set out in the Feasibility Study could benefit from the stability guarantees.1006 For example:\n\n- Clauses 2 and 4 set out that the Feasibility Study is approved, in accordance with Article 85 of the Mining Law.\n\n- Clause 5 describes the \"*amount of the investment of the Cerro Verde leaching project*.\u201d Specifically, Clause 5.1 provides that the execution of the investment plan required an approximate investment of USD 237 million. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent's expert that this implies that the totality of the investment was directed at all times to the Leaching Project and not to the Concentrator Project.1007\n\n- Clause 7, which relates to the termination of the investment plan, again specifically refers to the \"*leaching project of Cerro Verde*\u201d and sets out a mechanism under which the agreement could be suspended if investments not provided for in the investment plan were carried out.\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clauses 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\nMorales I (**RER-2**), \u00b6 64; Morales II (**RER-7**), \u00b6 53.\n\n746.\n\nHence, also according to a systematic interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement, the Tribunal is satisfied that the 1998 Stability Agreement's scope did not cover the Concentrator.\n\n**(6) The contextual interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n747.\n\nUnder a contextual interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement, the Tribunal must interpret the Agreement in accordance with the principle of good faith and the common intention of the parties.1008 The Tribunal notes that the Parties and their experts disagree on the exact application of the contextual interpretation, and in particular as to whether a historic interpretation and an interpretation of the parties' own acts are to be applied.1009 The Tribunal finds that it can leave this issue open because even under the Claimant's approach to contextual interpretation, which considers the acts of the parties prior and after the execution of the 1998 Stability Agreement as well as a functional interpretation of the Agreement, the Tribunal has no doubt that the Concentrator was not covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\nPeruvian Civil Code (**CA-39**), Articles 168, 1362.\n\nBullard II (**CER-7**), \u00b6\u00b6 39 *et seq.*; Morales I (**RER-2**), \u00b6\u00b6 70 *et seq.*\n\n**(6.1) The Parties' actions prior to the conclusion of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n748.\n\nThe starting point of the Tribunal's analysis is to assess the Parties' actions prior to the conclusion of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n749.\n\nIn 1979, Minero Peru built a pilot concentrator plant with a capacity of 100 MT/D.1010 The potential for development of Cerro Verde's primary sulfides was therefore clearly considered as early as 1979.\n\nMorgan Grenfell & Co. Ltd., Cerro Verde Copper Mine: Information Memorandum dated April 1993 (**CE-321**), p. 1.1.\n\n750.\n\nIn 1994, under the Share Purchase Agreement between Minero Peru and Cyprus, Cyprus committed to the construction of a concentrator at Cerro Verde. The construction of a concentrator was thus clearly still envisaged in 1994.\n\n751.\n\nIn June 1996, ICF Kaiser assessed the feasibility of a concentrator in the 1996 Mill Feasibility Study.1011 The 1996 Mill Feasibility Study concluded that, \"*[a]lthough the project ha[d] improved significantly since the earlier 1995 Study, the pretax discounted cash flow [would] still not support the required investment*\u201d due to, *inter alia*, the lack of economical options for power and water.\n\nICF Kaiser Engineers Inc., Feasibility Study Analysis for the Cerro Verde Project dated 1 June 1996 (**CE-350**).\n\n752.\n\nIn September 1996, the President of Cyprus sent a letter to the General Manager of Minero Peru advising that it was \"*not [\u2026] economically prudent to at this time make investments for the engineering and construction of a mill to process the Cerro Verde sulphide ores*.\u201d1012 Accordingly, Cyprus exercised its right to reduce its investment commitment under the Share Purchase Agreement.\n\nLetter from Cyprus Climax Metals Co. to Empresa Minera del Per\u00fa S.A. dated 16 September 1996 (**CE-11**), p. 2.\n\n753.\n\nThe 1996 Feasibility Study, which served as the basis for the 1998 Stability Agreement, outlined the features of SMCV's investment and was clearly limited to the Leaching Project. The 1996 Feasibility Study states:\n\n*1.1 Scope of Feasibility Study*\n\n*The feasibility study covers the Cerro Verde leaching project, from geological study through cathode production and sales. The study describes all operations, including those that form part of the leach process and its support facilities [\u2026].*\n\n*1.2 Objective of the Study*\n\n*The objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of producing 105 million (MM) lb./year (48,000 mtpy) of cathode copper from the heap leaching of copper ore at the Cerro Verde facilities [\u2026].*\n\n*1.3 Basis of the Study*\n\n*The study is based on test data results and operating experience obtained to date from leaching secondary sulfide ore at Cerro Verde, as well as from operating experience in the other unit processes at Cerro Verde.*1013\n\nFeasibility Study, Executive Summary dated 1996 (**CE-9**), pp. 2-3.\n\n754.\n\nSMCV's application to MINEM to enter into a 15-year stabilization agreement made reference to the 1996 Feasibility Study. The application noted that the \"*project [\u2026] is intended to expand the production capacity from 72,000,000 to 105,000,000 pounds (48,000 metric tons) of copper cathodes per year with a total investment of US$ 240,247,000*.\u201d1014\n\nStabilization Agreement Request dated 25 January 1996 (**CE-7**), p. 2.\n\n755.\n\nThe report that supported MINEM's approval of the investment project likewise stated:\n\n*The objective of the Study is to evaluate the feasibility of producing 105 million pounds per year of copper cathodes in Cerro Verde's facilities, considering the results of the experimental tests and operating experience with leaching secondary sulfides in Cerro Verde, [it] will expand the processing capacity of Cerro Verde by installing the necessary equipment to improve the leaching process using the latest technology.*1015\n\nMINEM, Report No. 033-96-EM-DGM-DFM/DFAE dated 27 March 1996 (**RE-25**), at \"Objective.\u201d\n\n756.\n\nThe resolution that approved the Feasibility Study provided:\n\n*[t]hat [SMCV] has submitted a Feasibility Study to the General Mining Directorate [whose] objective is the production of approximately 105 million pounds per year of copper cathodes in Cerro Verde's facilities [\u2026].*\n\n*Article 1. Approve the Feasibility Study submitted by [SMCV] in the amount of approximately US $237,517,000, which is part of this Resolution as an annex [\u2026].*\n\n*Article 3. Submit to the Office of the Vice Minister of Mines the information regarding the Feasibility Study that is approved in this Resolution in order to sign the corresponding Tax Stability Agreement, with [SMCV], which shall communicate to the General Mining Directorate the completion of the execution of the investments committed in the Feasibility Study.*1016\n\nMINEM, Directorial Resolution No. 158-96-EM/DGM dated 6 May 1996 (**RE-24**), pp. 1-2.\n\n757.\n\nThe 1996 Feasibility Study, the report by the DGM analyzing the study, and the MINEM resolution approving the study all evidence that the investment project was for the purposes of expanding SMCV's leaching facilities to increase the production of copper cathodes. They did not set out anything in relation to the Concentrator, which at the time of the conclusion of the 1998 Stability Agreement had already been considered but determined to be uneconomical.1017\n\nLetter from Cyprus Climax Metals Co. to Empresa Minera del Per\u00fa S.A. dated 16 September 1996 (**CE-11**), p. 2; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 87(d).\n\n758.\n\nIn 1997, the pilot concentrator was even dismantled.\n\n759.\n\nThe Tribunal, therefore, finds that nothing in this course of events allowed SMCV to consider that the future Concentrator would be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n**(6.2) The Parties' actions following the conclusion of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n760.\n\nIn assessing the Parties' actions after the conclusion of the 1998 Stability Agreement, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant alleges that MINEM officials explicitly confirmed that, because the Concentrator would be part of SMCV's integrated mining unit, SMCV could expand its existing Beneficiation Concession to include the Concentrator and that doing so would ensure that the Concentrator would be entitled to stability guarantees.1018\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 89.\n\n761.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal only finds evidence that contradicts the Claimant's position. Save for Ms. Chappuis' alleged confirmation that the Concentrator would be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement through the extension of the Beneficiation Concession,1019 which the Tribunal finds to be unproven and based on inconsistent testimony, there are only circumstances that clearly refute a common intent that the Concentrator would be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\nChappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6\u00b6 52-53.\n\n**(6.2.1) Ms. Chappuis' alleged confirmation that the Concentrator was covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement through the extension of the Beneficiation Concession**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n762.\n\nThe Claimant's claim that MINEM officials allegedly confirmed that the 1998 Stability Agreement would cover the Concentrator is based on the testimonial evidence of three witnesses, Ms. Chappuis, Ms. Torreblanca, and Mr. Davenport.\n\n763.\n\nMs. Chappuis, who was the Director-General of MINEM, allegedly confirmed to SMCV representatives during meetings that the extension of the Beneficiation Concession would allow the Concentrator to be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement. She states in her witness statement:\n\n*I recall that I repeated to the representatives of SMCV that the scope of stability guarantees under the Mining Law and the Regulations was clear, and that the Stability Agreement would apply to any investment that SMCV made in its mining unit throughout the Agreement's effective term.*1020\n\nChappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6 52.\n\n764.\n\nShe further testifies:\n\n*In my opinion as Director General of Mining, SMCV just needed to ask MINEM to expand the geographical area and installed capacity of its beneficiation concession to include the concentrator's operations. As I mentioned, Clause 3 of the Agreement was clear in that the same 'is circumscribed to the concessions, related in EXHIBIT I,' which in turn expressly included SMCV's mining and beneficiation concessions. Vice-Minister Polo had a different view [\u2026].*1021\n\nChappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6 53.\n\n765.\n\nMs. Torreblanca, who was the Legal and Environmental Director of SMCV at the time of the alleged meetings with Ms. Chappuis, also testifies that Ms. Chappuis confirmed that an extension of the Beneficiation Concession would allow the Concentrator to be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement. She states in her witness statement:\n\n*[W]e naturally wanted the Government to confirm that it would respect SMCV's stability guarantees and not impose royalties during the term of the Stability Agreement. I recall that I asked them whether the Government would be willing to give us a written guarantee or amend the Stability Agreement so that it made express reference to the Concentrator and to the fact that we would not pay royalties until December 2013. Their response was generally the same: that we did not have to worry because the Agreement would protect any investment that SMCV made in its Mining Concession and Beneficiation Concession during the term of the Agreement.*\n\n*I recall that Director Chappuis was particularly clear about this: she told us that, in accordance with the Mining Law and the Regulations, the Stability Agreement applied to the entirety of the Cerro Verde Mining Unit (i.e., the Mining and Beneficiation Concessions), and thus we merely had to expand the Beneficiation Concession to include the Concentrator.*1022\n\nTorreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6\u00b6 24-25.\n\n766.\n\nMs. Torreblanca further testifies:\n\n*Director Chappuis explained that, since the new Concentrator investment would form part of SMCV's existing integrated mining unit, it would be covered by the existing Stability Agreement. She told us that there was no need for an amendment to the Stability Agreement to include an additional beneficiation concession. Rather, since the investment in the Concentrator would be made within SMCV's existing Mining Unit, SMCV could simply apply for the expansion of the existing Beneficiation Concession that was already covered by the Stability Agreement.*\n\n*In light of the DGM's confirmation that the Concentrator would be covered by the Stability Agreement if it was included in the existing Beneficiation Concession, SMCV no longer saw the need to press for additional written* 1023 *guarantees.*\n\nTorreblanca II (**CWS-21**), \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.\n\n767.\n\nMs. Torreblanca testified during the Hearing that the DGM provided oral confirmations to SMCV in both 2003 and 2004 that the Concentrator would be stabilized.1024 This testimony is inconsistent with Ms. Chappuis' testimony during the *SMM Cerro Verde* hearing, in which she stated that such confirmation was provided at one meeting only.1025 This being said, the Tribunal turns to each of the alleged meetings. With respect to the alleged confirmation in 2003, Ms. Torreblanca testified in the Hearing that the written record on the oral confirmations was no longer available to her.1026 With respect to the alleged confirmation in 2004, Ms. Torreblanca testified in the Hearing that this was reported back to Mr. Davenport in an email.1027 However, the Claimant has not submitted any written evidence in relation to the alleged confirmations in 2003 and 2004. Ms. Torreblanca affirmed during the Hearing that \"*[a]ll [of SMCV's] emails were erased*\u201d in 2014 due to \"*changes in the system*.\u201d1028 In the event that such emails had existed, the Tribunal finds it unconvincing that SMCV would (i) not have safeguarded such evidence, and (ii) not have made use of such emails in any proceedings before their alleged deletion in 2014 in light of the fact that the alleged conversation concerned a USD 800 million investment and the question of whether this investment would be stabilized.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 559, line 19 to p. 560, line 6.\n\n*SMM Cerro Verde Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/20/14, Transcript, Hearing on Jurisdiction and Merits, Day 3 (**CE-1135**), p. 871, lines 3-17.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 560, line 21 to p. 561, line 8.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 524, line 13 to p. 527, line 12.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 528, lines 3-10.\n\n768.\n\nMoreover, when asked by the Tribunal whether he had received explicit confirmation from MINEM that the extension of the Beneficiation Concession would shield the Concentrator from the Royalty Law, Mr. Davenport, the President and General Manager of SMCV, stated that \"*it was implied*.\u201d1029 Mr. Davenport's own testimony thus contradicts the Claimant's argument that an explicit confirmation was given by the Respondent as to coverage of the Concentrator in the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 810, line 21 to p. 811, line 4.\n\n769.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Davenport answered a question of the President during the Hearing on how he internally reported to Phelps Dodge. His answer also evidences the total lack of documentation of this alleged assurance by Ms. Chappuis that the Concentrator would be stabilized:\n\n*[THE WITNESS:] How I communicated that to Phelps Dodge, I don't remember. I probably either sent them an email or called them or they were there. They knew that that's what our direction was. So, I don't remember specific--I mean, I don't remember going out and saying: 'Hey, let's go out and have a few beers. We just succeeded in this.' I don't remember that part, but I'm sure I communicated in some manner with them.*\n\n*PRESIDENT HANEFELD: So, you cannot refer us to any written documents and how, so to say, this understanding within the company was shared and celebrated?*\n\n*THE WITNESS: Well, I guess the written document is, you know, mostly, I guess, these presentations that said we met with--we're doing an addendum, we've met with MINEM, and they said: 'Well, you can do that, but here's a better path to do it than the expansion.'*\n\n*Whether there was a written document--I didn't see it in the materials that I reviewed. I don't remember that, other than the presentations I made.*1030\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 831, line 7 to p. 832, line 7.\n\n770.\n\nThe Tribunal finds it unconvincing that after months of alleged meetings with MINEM officials seeking confirmation that the Concentrator would be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement, neither Mr. Davenport nor Ms. Torreblanca would have kept internal records capturing MINEM's alleged assurances that the Concentrator would be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n771.\n\nIn any event, even if such meetings would have occurred and Ms. Chappuis would have shared her opinion that the extension of the Beneficiation Concession would allow the Concentrator to benefit from the guarantees of the 1998 Stability Agreement, the Tribunal finds that this does not constitute a sufficient basis for SMCV and its shareholders to rely on Ms. Chappuis' opinion. This is because (i) Ms. Chappuis' opinion was clearly contradicted by documents of higher MINEM officials, which she as well as SMCV and Phelps Dodge were aware of, and (ii) Ms. Chappuis did not have the authority to bind the DGM in relation to the modification of stability agreements. Ms. Chappuis' opinion could thus not have had the legal effect that the Claimant seeks to establish in these proceedings.\n\n772.\n\nIn the Hearing, Ms. Chappuis expressly confirmed that she knew that \"*Vice-Minister Polo had a different view*\u201d as to whether the extension of the Beneficiation Concession could cover new investments.1031 Moreover, while she testified that all lawyers in her team agreed that the inclusion of the Concentrator in an expanded Beneficiation Concession meant that the Concentrator was stabilized,1032 she also admitted that there were no minutes or any other type of evidence recording this alleged assurance from MINEM.1033\n\nChappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6 53.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 1032, line 10 to p. 1033, line 5.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 1025, line 16 to p. 1026, line 3.\n\n773.\n\nMs. Chappuis' alleged assurance that the Concentrator would be stabilized is rather clearly contradicted by other evidence. For example, by:\n\n- Mr. Polo's declaration at the Mining Royalties Forum on 11 March 2004, where he explained that:\n\n*Stabilization agreements are not granted per company, that is important to clarify. A company can have [a] stabilization agreement for one project and not have it for another [project], or [can] have an old activity that does not have a stabilization agreement and a new one that does. That's how it is, it is not granted for the whole company. An investment above 20 million or above 50 is made, depending on the case, and it grants the right to stabiliz[e] for that investment, for that development, not for the whole company.*1034\n\n- Mr. Davenport's testimony during the Hearing that he was aware that Mr. Polo did not agree with Ms. Chappuis' understanding of the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement.1035\n\nAudio of C\u00e9sar Polo's Presentation, Mining Royalties Forum, Congress of the Republic dated 11 March 2004 (excerpts) (**RE-185**), at timestamps 00:09:37 - 00:10:03.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 784, line 9 to p. 785, line 22.\n\n774.\n\nThis in itself is sufficient to conclude that SMCV could not rely on any alleged confirmations by Ms. Chappuis that the extension of the Beneficiation Concession would enable the Concentrator to come under the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n775.\n\nIn addition, former MINEM officials testified at the Hearing that, under MINEM's regulations and procedures, the expansion of a beneficiation concession does not change the scope of mining stabilization agreements. In this regard, Mr. Tovar, who was the person responsible at MINEM for authorizing the expansion of SMCV's Beneficiation Concession in 2004, confirmed that the application and procedure to expand a beneficiation concession was an independent procedure, unrelated to the 1998 Stability Agreement's scope.1036\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 1449, line 19 to p. 1450, line 9.\n\n776.\n\nMr. Isasi, MINEM's former legal director, confirmed that the approval to expand a beneficiation concession did not have the effect of amending a stabilization agreement.1037 In addition, Mr. Isasi testified that a modification of a stabilization agreement required his approval as the head of MINEM's legal department as well as the approval and signature of the Minister,1038 neither of which SMCV sought or obtained.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 1201, line 20 to p. 1202, line 9.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 1202, lines 2-9.\n\n777.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Polo made clear during his testimony that the conclusion, amendment or extension of a stability agreement is an exceptional act which requires the Minister's or the Vice-Minister's approval.1039 Specifically, he testified that the DGM cannot amend stabilization agreements and that an official like Ms. Chappuis could not act beyond the powers granted to her by law, and, thus, could not change the 1998 Stability Agreement, *i.e*., an agreement that higher ranking officials had approved.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 5, p. 1305, lines 4-20; p. 1332, line 1 to p. 1333, line 8.\n\n**(6.2.2) The evidential record of events following the conclusion of the 1998 Stability Agreement confirms that the Concentrator was not covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n778.\n\nWhile the Tribunal has found no evidence in writing of any alleged confirmations by Ms. Chappuis that the USD 800 million investment in the Concentrator would be stabilized, the Tribunal has, however, found a considerable amount of documentary evidence confirming the Parties' joint understanding that the 1998 Stability Agreement did not cover the Concentrator.\n\n779.\n\nIn March 2001, Minero Peru and Phelps Dodge entered into the Settlement Agreement pursuant to which Phelps Dodge committed to continue evaluating the building of a concentrator plant.1040 As confirmed by the Claimant's witness, Ms. Torreblanca, the Settlement Agreement did not set out any obligation to construct a concentrator plant.1041 Accordingly, and contrary to the Claimant's argument,1042 with the conclusion of the Settlement Agreement, Phelps Dodge and Minero Peru relinquished the obligation of the Share Purchase Agreement to construct a \"*grinding and conventional copper/molybdenum flotation circuit.*\u201d1043 In its Reply, the Claimant even recognizes that \"*at the time SMCV signed the Stability Agreement, it had not yet determined whether the Concentrator would ultimately be economically and financially feasible*.\u201d1044\n\nOut-of-Court Settlement Agreement Between Cyprus Climax Metals Co. and Empresa Minera del Per\u00fa S.A. dated 30 March 2001 (**CE-17**).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 517, lines 7-20.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 62.\n\nShare Purchase Agreement dated 17 March 1994 (**CE-4**), Article 3.1(f)-(g); Appendix (G).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 87(d).\n\n780.\n\nIn 2002, SUNAT issued a report in which it noted that \"*Tax Stability [Agreements] entered into pursuant to Title Nine of the TUO of the General Mining Law only stabilize the applicable tax regime with respect to the investment activities that are the subject matter of the agreements, for their execution in a determined concession or an Administrative-Economic Unit*.\u201d1045 This phrasing likewise left no doubt that only the leaching activities at Cerro Verde were covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement and that the profits of a future Concentrator, if any, would, on the contrary, not be covered by the Agreement.\n\nSUNAT, Report No. 263-2002-SUNAT/K00000 dated 23 September 2002 (**RE-26**), p. 3.\n\n781.\n\nSMCV was indisputably also aware of the 2002 SUNAT Report. An internal SMCV presentation prepared in August 2004 expressly referred to this 2002 SUNAT Report.1046\n\nSMCV, Justification of Request for Formal Inclusion of Benefit Concession in the Current Stability Agreement dated August 2004 (**CE-453**), slide 39.\n\n782.\n\nIn 2002, SMCV conducted the 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study for the Concentrator and specifically assessed the stability agreements in force at Cerro Verde, including the 1998 Stability Agreement.1047 The 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study shows that certain recommendations concerning the 1998 Stability Agreement were made.1048 The only major recommendation related to the 1998 Stability Agreement was to \"*[i]mmediately negotiate with the government to ensure the **reinvestment of profit tax credit** outlined in the existing stability agreement between [Cerro Verde] and the Peruvian government*\u201d (emphasis added).1049 Also, the index of appendices to the 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study shows that SMCV clearly distinguished between the concept of reinvestment of profits and other guarantees under the 1998 Stability Agreement. The study contains both an \"*Appendix D*\u201d concerning the \"*Reinvestment of Profits Law*\u201d as well as an \"*Appendix E*\u201d concerning the \"*Review of Stability Agreement by Rodrigo, El\u00edas & Medrano.*\u201d1050\n\n2002 Pre-Feasibility Study (**CE-928**), pp. 58 *et seq*.; SMCV, Primary Sulfide Preliminary Pre-Feasibility Study, Volumes II and III, December 2002 (excerpts) dated December 2002 (**RE-351**).\n\n2002 Pre-Feasibility Study (**CE-928**), pp. 61 *et seq.*\n\n2002 Pre-Feasibility Study (**CE-928**), p. 7.\n\nSMCV, Primary Sulfide Preliminary Pre-Feasibility Study, Volumes II and III, December 2002 (excerpts) dated December 2002 (**RE-351**), p. xi.\n\n783.\n\nMs. Torreblanca and Mr. Davenport confirmed during the Hearing that SMCV consulted with external counsel regarding the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement when preparing the 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study.1051 This legal advice, which the Claimant's counsel confirmed that it concerned the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement,1052 has however been heavily redacted in the 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study. In light of these redactions, the Tribunal is not able to assess whether such advice was supportive of the Claimant's position. The Tribunal considers it likely that the Claimant would have disclosed the document in full had the advice been favorable to its position in these proceedings.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 620, lines 10-17; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 838, lines 1-8.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 618, lines 1-5.\n\n784.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Davenport testified during the Hearing that he was \"*sure*\u201d that a sensitivity analysis assuming that the Concentrator was not stabilized under the 1998 Stability Agreement was conducted.1053 This contradicts Ms. Torreblanca's testimony that \"*[t]here was no uncertainty*\u201d regarding the stabilization of the Concentrator.1054 The Claimant also states in its Post-Hearing Brief that the 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study \"*clearly applied the non-stabilized tax regime, as it is titled 'Peru Current system' and appears under the heading 'Tax Regime,' immediately after the 'CV Estabilization' assumption that SMCV used in the base case*.\u201d1055 The Tribunal concludes therefrom that the risk that the stabilized regime would not apply to Cerro Verde's primary sulfides was duly taken into consideration by SMCV and Phelps Dodge when making their investment decision to build the Concentrator.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 835, line 14 to p. 838, line 8.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 619, lines 16-21.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 64(b).\n\n785.\n\nIn July 2003, Ms. Torreblanca notably wrote to Ms. Chappuis and only requested confirmation that SMCV would be entitled to apply the profit reinvestment benefit as a result of the 1998 Stability Agreement.1056 Ms. Torreblanca explained that SMCV's decision to build a concentrator was \"*directly related*\u201d to its right to reinvest non-distributed profits back into the project and recognized that the 1998 Stability Agreement only referred to the \"*Leaching Project rather than to the Cerro Verde Project*.\u201d1057 Ms. Torreblanca *inter alia* noted:\n\n*Given that the executed stability agreement makes reference therein to the Leaching Project rather than to the Cerro Verde Project, which also includes the Primary Sulfides Project, we request clarification that the Investment Program using Non-Distributed Profits to be submitted would be approved regardless of the fact that it is not confined to the Leaching Project.*\n\n*In order to complete this aspect related to reinvesting profits in the Feasibility Study, we would like to ask for your opinion on this matter, to be able to specify that the reinvestment of profits stabilized for Cerro Verde, regulated by Executive Decree 024-93-EM, Regulation of the Promotion of Mining Investment, and Executive Decree 07-94-EM, Regulation of the Procedure for Submitting, Approving, and Executing Investment Programs using Non-Distributed Profits, is applicable to the Primary Sulfides Project, even though the stability agreement does not mention this project. This is requested because this agreement stabilizes the profit-reinvestment regime for the mining titleholder rather than for the project that gave rise to its signing.*1058\n\nSMCV, Petition No. 1418719 to MINEM dated 3 July 2003 (**CE-394**).\n\nSMCV, Petition No. 1418719 to MINEM dated 3 July 2003 (**CE-394**).\n\nSMCV, Petition No. 1418719 to MINEM dated 3 July 2003 (**CE-394**).\n\n786.\n\nMs. Torreblanca eventually even submitted a formal request to MINEM on behalf of SMCV for permission to reinvest profits to construct \"*a concentrator to process the primary sulfide ore*\u201d in the Cerro Verde Mining Unit on 28 January 2004.1059 In contrast, the Tribunal has not been presented with a similar request for clarification and a corresponding response by MINEM in relation to the issue of whether the 1998 Stability Agreement covered the Concentrator.\n\nSMCV, Petition No. 3616468 to MINEM dated 28 January 2004 (**CE-421**).\n\n787.\n\nOn 8 September 2003, the DGM replied to SMCV in a report written by a MINEM attorney and engineer and approved by Ms. Chappuis. The report stated:\n\n*About the question whether the stabilized regime would be applicable to the company, the prohibition contained in Article 8 of Supreme Decree No. 027-98-EF points out that **the application of the Stabilized Regime is granted to the Cerro Verde Leaching Project and not to the company and the Regime is the one described in the aforementioned agreement**.*1060 (emphasis added)\n\nMINEM, Report No. 509-2003-MEM-DGM-TNO dated 8 September 2003 (**CE-398**), p. 1.\n\n788.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this response is unambiguous in affirming that the stabilized regime only applied to the Cerro Verde Leaching Project.\n\n789.\n\nOn the same day, in another MINEM Report, the DGM responded to SMCV's request concerning the reinvestment of profits by stating that \"*[t]he Project for the Primary Sulfide Exploitation could be eligible for this benefit, there being no requirement that the agreement giving rise to the benefit should have previously contemplated it as a project.*\u201d1061 In the Claimant's view, this wording means that \"*[t]he DGM recognized that the Concentrator would be part of SMCV's Mining Unit, which was covered by the Stability Agreement*.\u201d1062 However, the Tribunal finds that nothing in the letter can be read as a recognition that the Concentrator would be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement. Rather, the scope of the DGM's response was limited to the issue of the reinvestment of profits. The Tribunal comes to the same conclusion with respect to the MEF's opinion on the reinvestment of profits benefit.1063\n\nMINEM, Report No. 510-2003-MEM-DGM-TNO dated 8 September 2003 (**CE-399**), p. 2.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 96(c).\n\nMinistry of Economy and Finance, Informe No. 209-2004-EF/66.01 dated 3 December 2004 (**CE-22**).\n\n790.\n\nOn 27 August 2004, SMCV submitted a request to the DGM to expand the Beneficiation Concession to include the Concentrator.1064\n\nSMCV, Petition No. 1487019 to MINEM dated 27 August 2004 (**CE-457**).\n\n791.\n\nOn 26 October 2004, MINEM approved SMCV's request to expand the Beneficiation Concession.1065 Neither SMCV's request to expand the Beneficiation Concession nor MINEM's approval of the expansion of the Beneficiation Concession mentions the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\nMINEM, Report No. 784-2004-MEM-DGM/PDM and Directorial Order No. 027-2004-MEM-DGM/PDM dated 26 October 2004 (**CE-476**).\n\n792.\n\nOn 9 December 2004, the Minister of Energy and Mines gave final approval to SMCV's request to apply the profit reinvestment benefit to construct the Concentrator.1066 It stated that the profits that would benefit from the profit-reinvestment program had to be \"*exclusively generated by the 'Cerro Verde Leaching Project.'*\u201d1067 Again, the Tribunal finds that such clear language implies that the new investment in the Concentrator was not covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\nMEF, Ministerial Resolution No. 510-2004-MEM/DM dated 9 December 2004 (**CE-23**).\n\nMEF, Ministerial Resolution No. 510-2004-MEM/DM dated 9 December 2004 (**CE-23**), Article 1.\n\n793.\n\nMr. Davenport testified at the Hearing that SMCV wrote twice to MINEM seeking confirmation that the profit reinvestment benefit would be granted to SMCV \"*because it's important*.\u201d1068 However, the Tribunal has not been confronted with any documents evidencing any explicit request for confirmation by SMCV that the Concentrator would fall under the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement. The Claimant's expert, Mr. Bullard, confirmed during the Hearing that he might have advised his client to request such confirmation.1069 When questioned on this issue, Ms. Torreblanca and Mr. Davenport confirmed during the Hearing that SMCV initially sought explicit written assurances from MINEM that the Concentrator would be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement.1070 However, Ms. Chappuis explained that when SMCV asked whether to submit a request in writing, she told them \"*I think not*.\u201d1071 In the Tribunal's view, Ms. Chappuis' answer could evidence that Ms. Chappuis knew that MINEM would not be able to positively answer SMCV's request. Her response is, in any event, puzzling in light of the extensive correspondence in relation to the reinvestment of profits benefit and the extension of the Beneficiation Concession.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 772, line 15 to p. 774, line 12.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 8, p. 2372, lines 3-9.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 557, lines 2-14; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 778, line 17 to p. 779, line 4.\n\n*SMM Cerro Verde Netherlands B.V. v.

See also: Chappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6\u00b6 51-52.\n\n794.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that SMCV and Phelps Dodge were doubtful as to the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement and the Respondent was consistent in considering the Concentrator not covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n795.\n\nAs recalled above, Mr. Davenport specifically confirmed during the Hearing:\n\n*We approached them and said: \"We would like to get confirmation that the Concentrator--please put it in writing--that the Concentrator will be stabilized.\u201d*1072\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 557, lines 2-14.\n\n796.\n\nThis, at the minimum, shows that SMCV had doubts as to the exact scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n797.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Davenport confirmed at the Hearing that SMCV made presentations to MINEM in 2004 asking for an amendment to the 1998 Stability Agreement to include the Concentrator.1073 In a presentation dated July 2004, SMCV *inter alia* noted that there was a \"*need for certainty*\u201d with respect to the envisioned investment in the Concentrator. The presentation referred to a \"*requested addendum*\u201d to the 1998 Stability Agreement to provide for such certainty.1074 In another presentation dated August 2004, SMCV likewise requested that an *addendum* be included in the Annex I of the 1998 Stability Agreement to cover the \"*Beneficiation Concession: Primary Sulfides Concentrator*.\u201d1075 The presentation stated \"*SMCV requires certainty today with regard to clarity in the Agreement to make an investment decision of more than US$800 million.*\u201d1076 The presentation also referred to the 2002 SUNAT Report,1077 which had clarified that stabilization agreements \"*only stabilize the applicable tax regime with respect to the investment activities that are the subject matter of the agreements*.\u201d1078\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 830, line 21 to p. 831, line 6; Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A., \"Past, Present, Future\u201d dated July 2004 (**CE-450**), slide 45; SMCV, Justification of Request for Formal Inclusion of Benefit Concession in the Current Stability Agreement dated August 2004 (**CE-453**), slide 11.\n\nSociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A., \"Past, Present, Future\u201d dated July 2004 (**CE-450**), slide 45.\n\nSMCV, Justification of Request for Formal Inclusion of Benefit Concession in the Current Stability Agreement dated August 2004 (**CE-453**), slide 11.\n\nSMCV, Justification of Request for Formal Inclusion of Benefit Concession in the Current Stability Agreement dated August 2004 (**CE-453**), slide 47 (emphasis omitted).\n\nSMCV, Justification of Request for Formal Inclusion of Benefit Concession in the Current Stability Agreement dated August 2004 (**CE-453**), slide 39.\n\nSUNAT, Report No. 263-2002-SUNAT/K00000 dated 23 September 2002 (**RE-26**), p. 3.\n\n798.\n\nOn 25 August 2004, a draft Phelps Dodge presentation titled \"*PDMC Growth Projects Cerro Verde Sulfide Update*\u201d prepared for the October 2004 Board Meeting was shared by email by a senior Phelps Dodge official.1079 The draft presentation noted among others that \"*the Mines Ministry has proposed a process to include sulfide plant in the facility covered by the existing stability agreement*\u201d and that this would \"*shield the sulfide operation from the royalty*.\u201d1080 The presentation further states that the project economics \"*assume[d] success [in] including [the] sulfide project in [the] existing stability agreement*.\u201d1081 Again, the Tribunal has not been presented with evidence showing said allegedly proposed process of a modification of the 1998 Stability Agreement. Moreover, the fact that the presentation explains that it \"*[a]ssumes success*\u201d1082 in including the Concentrator in the 1998 Stability Agreement's scope means that there was at least a recognized potential for failure of such a negotiation with MINEM.\n\nEmail from Dennis Bartlett to Timothy Snider, H.

The Minister stated that \"*[t]hen, who pays royalties? All mining titleholders pay royalties, but not for all of their projects.*\u201d1085 Mr. Isasi clarified that *\"the obliged subject is a mining company but when determining how much it must pay, the tax administration has to determine what is the reference basis, and to determine the reference basis, it must determine which are the stabilized mining projects and which are the non-stabilized projects*.\u201d1086 Again, this shows the Respondent's consistent interpretation of the scope of stabilization agreements.\n\nEnergy and Mines Congressional Committee, Congress of the Republic, Meeting Minutes dated 8 June 2005 (**RE-29**) (excerpts), p. 26.\n\nEnergy and Mines Congressional Committee, Congress of the Republic, Meeting Minutes dated 8 June 2005 (excerpts) (**RE-29**), p. 29.\n\n802.\n\nIn September 2005, a press article reported about the Concentrator and noted that the Minister of Energy and Mines issued a press release stating that \"*the expansion is not covered by the tax stability agreement signed on February 13, 1998, for the current operation of the Cerro Verde plant for Solvent Extraction and Electro-Winning (SX-EW) of oxides*.\u201d1087 The article also reported about \"*Phelps Dodge [arguing] that the stability agreement underlying its current operations should probably also cover its expansion project of USD 850M*.\u201d1088 In the Tribunal's view, this article further evidences that SMCV and/or Phelps Dodge were aware of the potential for discrepancy of views on the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n\"Minister: Cerro Verde Expansion Subject to Royalty,\u201d *Business News Americas* dated 20 September 2005 (**CE-511**).\n\n\"Minister: Cerro Verde Expansion Subject to Royalty,\u201d *Business News Americas* dated 20 September 2005 (**CE-511**).\n\n803.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal notes that the November 2005 Letter sent by the Minister of Energy and Mines to Congressman Diez Canseco in response to his request for information regarding MINEM's position on SMCV's royalty payments, made clear that the Concentrator would be subject to royalties once it commenced operations.1089 The Minister stated that:\n\n*In the first place, it is necessary to distinguish the legal treatment of the 'Cerro Verde Leaching' project, which is covered by an Agreement on Guarantees and Measures to Promote Investment, from that applicable to the new Primary Sulfide Project in which the profits from that old Leaching project will be reinvested. The Primary Sulfide project does not enjoy protection under any Guarantee or Stability agreement.*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*This new Sulfide Project has not been the subject of a new Agreement on Guarantees and Measures to Promote Investment in the mining business, so that it will have to pay the applicable royalties when it goes on line. If the company fails to honor this obligation, the National Superintendence of Tax Administration (SUNAT) must exercise the applicable administrative powers to make its collection effective.*\n\n*Additionally, it should be noted that it is not correct to claim that the profit reinvestment benefit applied to the Primary Sulfide Project (Cerro Verde 2). This project is the recipient of the profits from the Cerro Verde Leaching Project (Cerro Verde 1); these profits enjoy the benefit of reinvestment free of income tax by virtue of the Agreement on Guarantees and Measures to Promote Investment dated February 13, 1998.*1090\n\nMINEM, Report No. 2004-2005-MEM/DM dated 8 November 2005 (**CE-519**), p. 1.\n\nMINEM, Report No. 2004-2005-MEM/DM dated 8 November 2005 (**CE-519**), pp. 1-3.\n\n804.\n\nEven though this letter may not have been available to SMCV or Phelps Dodge in November 2005, the relevant excerpt of MINEM's letter was ultimately reproduced in a draft legislative bill in 2006.1091 In the Tribunal's view, SMCV could not have ignored this draft bill, which directly addressed the company's situation as it sought to repeal the ministerial resolution that had approved SMCV's reinvestment of profits.1092\n\nCongress, Draft Bill No. 14792/2005-CR (**CE-536**), p. 9.\n\nMEF, Ministerial Resolution No. 510-2004-MEM/DM dated 9 December 2004 (**CE-23**).\n\n805.\n\nIn 2005, Phelps Dodge also expressly stated in its SEC filings that there was uncertainty as to the inclusion of the Concentrator under the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement. In particular, when it issued its annual SEC 10K report for 2004, Phelps Dodge stated in relation to the Royalty Law that \"*it is not clear what, if any, effect the new royalty law will have on the operations at Cerro Verde*.\u201d1093 Moreover, SMCV's financial statement for 2005 and 2006 further express that the tax administration would have the power to review and correct the income tax determined by SMCV. The financial statement also reported that \"*[s]ince there may be differences in the interpretation by the tax administration of the regulations applicable to the Company, it is not possible to anticipate to date whether additional tax liabilities will occur*.\u201d1094\n\nPhelps Dodge, SEC Form 10-K for 2004 dated 7 March 2005 (**CE-901**), p. 80.\n\nSMCV, Financial Statements 2005-2006 dated 9 February 2007 (**CE-561**), p. 30.\n\n806.\n\nDuring the 2006 Roundtable Discussions, which SMCV attended, it was further made clear that while the reinvestment of profits approval \"*stemming from the leaching project in the new primary sulfides project [\u2026] is in accordance with the law,*\u201d1095 \"*any profits generated by the sulfides project may not be reinvested with a tax benefit*.\u201d1096 It was also clarified that the Cerro Verde Leaching Project was not subject to the Royalty Law,1097 but that:\n\n*Cerro Verde's primary sulfide project is not part of the Leaching Project, for this reason it does not benefit from the stabilized regime subject of the 13 February 1998 contract.*\n\n*It is a new project that does not benefit from tax, exchange rate and administrative stability.*\n\n*In consequence, the sulfides project will pay royalties when it enters into production.*1098\n\nMINEM, \"Reinvestment of Profits and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated June 2006 (**RE-107**), slide 7.\n\nMINEM, \"Reinvestment of Profits and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated June 2006 (**RE-107**), slide 9.\n\nMINEM, \"Reinvestment of Profits and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated June 2006 (**RE-107**), slide 11.\n\nMINEM, \"Reinvestment of Profits and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated June 2006 (**RE-107**), slide 15.\n\n807.\n\nIn June 2006, Mr. Isasi issued the June 2006 Report, in which he concluded that the 1998 Stability Agreement \"*deals only with the 'Cerro Verde Leaching Project*'\u201d and \"*cannot be extended to the entire company or to other non-stabilized projects*,\u201d and SMCV was thus required to pay royalties for the Concentrator.1099\n\nMINEM, Report No. 156-2006-MEM/OGJ dated 16 June 2006 (**CE-534**), Section I, \u00b6\u00b6 5.2-5.3, Section III, \u00b6\u00b6 4.3-4.5.\n\n808.\n\nFinally, once the Concentrator was built in 2007, the MINEM resolutions of early 2007 confirm that the Beneficiation Concession had been expanded but they do not even refer to the 1998 Stability Agreement.1100\n\nMINEM, Directorial Resolution No. 056-2007-MEM/DGM dated 26 February 2007 (**CE-28**); MINEM, Report No. 165-2007-MINEM-DGM/PDM dated 19 February 2007 (**CE-562**), p. 21; MINEM, Directorial Resolution No. 081-2007-MEM/DGM dated 11 April 2007 (**CE-564**).\n\n809.\n\nAll of these events, both individually and taken together, show that SMCV and Phelps Dodge had, at the minimum, doubts as to the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement, if not actual knowledge of its limited scope, and that the Respondent consistently interpreted the 1998 Stability Agreement as only covering the mining project set out therein, *i.e.,* the Leaching Project. SMCV's and Phelps Dodge's doubts could have led SMCV to seek assurances from MINEM in writing or clarifications with SUNAT, such as a binding opinion, for example through the Mining Council. However, as testified by Ms. Torreblanca, such a formal, institutional enquiry was not made before SUNAT as SMCV \"*didn't see the need*\u201d to do so.1101\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 628, line 12 to p. 630, line 12.\n\n**(7) The functional interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n810.\n\nUnder a functional interpretation of a contract under Peruvian law, expressions \"*that have various meanings must be understood in the one most appropriate for the nature and the purpose of the act*.\u201d1102 The Tribunal is not convinced that the terms of the 1998 Stability Agreement have \"*various meanings*\u201d and that the functional interpretation is thus even relevant.\n\nPeruvian Civil Code (**CA-39**), Article 170.\n\n811.\n\nIn any event, the Tribunal has already found that the \"*nature and purpose\u201d* of the 1998 Stability Agreement is to grant stability benefits in relation to the Leaching Project, which consists in \"*extend[ing] the production capacity from 72,000,000 to 105,000,000 lbs. (48,000 MT) of Copper cathodes per year coming from the heap leaching of the copper mineral in the facilities of Cerro Verde with recovery of 65%, that will be installed with the necessary equipment to improve the leaching of the secondary sulfides using the last technology and at the same time increase the production*.\u201d1103\n\n1998 Stability Agreement (**CE-12**), Clause 1.3.\n\n812.\n\nAccordingly, a functional interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement also confirms that the proceeds of the Concentrator were not covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n**(8) Conclusion on the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n813.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that it has conclusively established under the applicable rules of contract interpretation that the 1998 Stability Agreement did not extend to the entire Mining and Beneficiation Concessions. Rather, the stabilization guarantees only extended to the Leaching Project, which was the subject matter of the Feasibility Study and was the subject matter of the 1998 Stability Agreement. In light of this unequivocal interpretation under the literal, systematic, contextual, and functional rules of contract interpretation, the Tribunal does not need to decide whether the *contra proferentem* method of interpretation is applicable.\n\n814.\n\nBased on all of the above, the Tribunal likewise concludes that the guarantees of the 1998 Stability Agreement only extended to the Cerro Verde Leaching Project and that the extension of the Beneficiation Concession did not extend the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement to the Concentrator.\n\n**b) The issue of whether the Respondent breached the 1998 Stability Agreement**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n815.\n\nHaving clarified the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement, the Tribunal turns to the issue of whether the Respondent breached the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n816.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent breached Clauses 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10.1, and 10.2 of the 1998 Stability Agreement when its Royalty and Tax Assessments applying the non-stabilized regime to the Concentrator became final and enforceable.1104 However, the Tribunal has determined that the Concentrator did not benefit from the guarantees of the 1998 Stability Agreement. Thus, none of the disputed Royalty and Tax Assessments applying the non-stabilized regime to the Concentrator constituted violations of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 120 *et seq.*\n\n817.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the Respondent breached Clauses 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10.1, and 10.2 of the 1998 Stability Agreement when certain of its Tax Assessments applying the non-stabilized regime to the Leaching facilities became final and enforceable.1105 In particular, the Claimant submits:1106\n\n- In the 2010 and 2011 Income Tax Assessments, SUNAT applied non-stabilized depreciation rates to certain assets without attributing them to the Concentrator and\u2014in the 2012 and 2013 Income Tax Assessments\u2014to all the assets that SMCV started using as of 2007, including some of the same Leaching facilities' assets it had treated as stabilized in previous fiscal years.\n\n- In the 2007-2013 Income Tax Assessments, SUNAT denied SMCV's income tax deductions for PTU, expenses accrued in prior years, and recreational expenses, as well as deductions for payments that SMCV recorded using the classification system applicable under the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n- SUNAT assessed the following taxes from which SMCV was exempted by operation of the 1998 Stability Agreement against the entire Cerro Verde Mining Unit: 2009-2013 TTNA, 2007-2013 AIT, and 2013 CMPF.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 351.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 124.\n\n818.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that such assessments were imposed on the stabilized leaching activities of Cerro Verde.\n\n819.\n\nThe Respondent avers that these assessments were properly assessed against SMCV because SMCV failed to distinguish its stabilized activities from its non-stabilized ones. In the Respondent's view, under Article 22 of the Mining Regulations, SMCV had the obligation to keep separate accounts or to provide sufficient information to SUNAT to distinguish which of SMCV's assets and activities were related to the Leaching Project.1107 The Claimant disagrees that it was obliged to keep separate accounts for its different investments within the same concession.1108\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 662 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 127 *et seq.*\n\n820.\n\nThe key issue for the Tribunal to determine is whether SMCV was required to keep separate accounts for its Leaching and Concentrator activities or whether it would have been the obligation of SUNAT to distinguish between the stabilized and non-stabilized operations on its own account.\n\n821.\n\nAs a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that under Articles 87.5 and 87.6 of the Peruvian Tax Code, the onus is on the taxpayer to provide SUNAT with the required information to assess taxes.1109\n\nPeruvian Tax Code, Supreme Decree No. 133-2013-EF dated 22 June 2013 (**CA-14**), Articles 87.5, 87.6.\n\n822.\n\nFurthermore, the Mining Regulations establish obligations for mining companies. In particular, Article 22 of the Mining Regulations provides:\n\n*The contractual guarantees shall benefit the mining activity titleholder exclusively for the investments that it makes in the concessions or Economic-Administrative Units.*\n\n*To determine the results of its operations, a mining activity titleholder that has other concessions or Economic-Administrative Units shall keep independent accounts and reflect them in separate earnings statements.*\n\n*Expenses that are not directly identifiable in each concession or Economic-Administrative Unit shall be distributed among them in proportion to the net sales of the mining substances extracted from them.*1110\n\nMining Regulations (**CA-2**), Article 22.\n\n823.\n\nArticle 25 of the Mining Regulations provides:\n\n*Without prejudice to the Income and Corporate Assets Tax Returns which, according to the law, the mining activity titleholder must submit in cases of expansion of facilities or new investments that contractually enjoy the guarantee of legal stability, said titleholder must make available to the Tax Administration the annexes that demonstrate the application of the tax regime granted to the aforementioned expansions or new investments.*1111\n\nMining Regulations (**CA-2**), Article 25.\n\n824.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, these two articles of the Mining Regulations read together leave no doubt that (i) mining companies with stabilized and unstabilized activities have the obligation to keep separate accounts, and (ii) they are required to have available, for the tax authority, documents that demonstrate the application of the stabilized regime to the specific investment for which the stabilization agreement was approved.\n\n825.\n\nThe Claimant does not dispute that it did not keep separate accounts.1112 The Claimant also failed to show that SMCV made documents available to SUNAT which would have demonstrated the application of the stabilized regime specifically to assets or proceeds of the Leaching Project. Even when requested by SUNAT to provide relevant information,1113 SMCV failed to do so.1114\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 127(b), 129(c).\n\nSUNAT Report on Record No. 0550140001556 - No. 326-P-2012-SUNAT/2J0400 dated 30 March 2012 (**CE-69**), p. 126; SUNAT, Request for Information No. 0522110000184 dated 14 March 2011 (**RE-285**), p. 3; SUNAT, Report on Results of Request for Information Request No. 0522110000184 dated 6 May 2011 (excerpts) (**RE-286**), p. 29; SUNAT, Request for Information No. 0522110000346 dated 6 May 2011 (**RE-287**); SUNAT, Report on Results of Request for Information No. 0522110000346 dated 24 May 2011 (**RE-288**); SUNAT, Request for Information No. 0522110000870 dated 20 September 2011 (**RE-289**); SUNAT, Report on Results of Request for Information No. 0522110000870 dated 5 October 2011 (**RE-290**), p. 12; SUNAT, Request for Information No. 0522110000940 dated 5 October 2011 (**RE-291**); SUNAT, Report on Results of Request for Information No. 0522110000940 dated 5 October 2012 (**RE-292**); SUNAT Resolution No. 0550140001907 dated 30 May 2014 (notified to SMCV on 10 June 2014) (**CE-109**), p. 177; SUNAT, Request for Information No. 0522120000345 dated 4 April 2012 (**RE-293**), p. 3; SUNAT, Request for Information No. 0522120000347 dated 4 April 2012 (**RE-294**), p. 3; SUNAT, Report on Results of Request for Information No. 0522120000345 dated 19 March 2013 (**RE-295**), p. 16; SUNAT, Report on Results of Request for Information No. 0522120000347 dated 19 March 2013 (**RE-296**), p. 16; SUNAT, Request for Information No. 0522130000409 dated 19 March 2013 (**RE-297**); SUNAT, Request for Information No. 0522130000411 dated 19 March 2013 (**RE-298**); SUNAT, Report on Results of Request for Information No. 0522130000409 dated 23 December 2013 (**RE-299**); SUNAT, Report on Results of Request for Information No. 0522130000411 dated 23 June 2014 (**RE-300**); SUNAT, Request for Information No. 0522120000346 dated 4 April 2012 (**RE-301**), p. 3; SUNAT, Report on Results of Request for Information No. 0522120000346 dated 19 March 2013 (**RE-302**), p. 16; SUNAT, Request for Information No. 0522130000408 dated 19 March 2013 (**RE-303**); SUNAT, Report on Results of Request for Information No. 0522130000408 dated 15 September 2014 (**RE-304**).\n\nSee for example: Tax Tribunal Resolution No. 06367-2-2018 (2006 Income Tax Assessment) dated 22 August 2018 (**CE-191**), p. 33; Tax Tribunal Resolution No. 06369-2-2018 (2007 Income Tax Assessment) dated 22 August 2018 (notified to SMCV on 19 November 2018) (**CE-192**), p. 48.\n\n826.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Peruvian law did not provide relevant guidance for SMCV to accurately separate its accounts. The Claimant's expert argues that \"*[e]very material aspect of a tax\u2014including how it must be calculated\u2014must be clearly and expressly defined in law*.\u201d1115 However, the Tribunal does not find this argument to be convincing. First, as testified by the Respondent's expert, there are \"*various methods and criteria [\u2026] used to separate accounts*\u201d in Peru, which SMCV could have used. Second, the Tribunal finds that had SMCV had doubts as to the proper method of separating accounts, it could have expressed this to SUNAT, for example in its replies to SUNAT's requests. The Tribunal has not been presented with evidence that SMCV did so.\n\nHern\u00e1ndez II (**CER-8**), \u00b6 17.\n\n827.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal notes that Article 22 of the Mining Regulation provides that \"*[e]xpenses that are not directly identifiable in each concession or Economic-Administrative Unit shall be distributed among them in proportion to the net sales of the mining substances extracted from them*.\u201d However, the Claimant has not asserted let alone proven to the Tribunal's satisfaction that this obliges SUNAT to assess certain taxes also only in proportion to the net sales of the mining substances extracted. In this regard, the Tribunal notes the following exchange between the President of the Tribunal and Dr. Pic\u00f3n during the Hearing:\n\n*PRESIDENT HANEFELD: But Claimant made the argument that SUNAT should have divided somehow, then, between leaching and Concentrator. And so, is it then on SUNAT to apply some sort of a split to the best of its estimate, or is there no legal basis for this and this does not happen in practice?*\n\n*THE WITNESS: (Mr. Pic\u00f3n) Both in practice and in the Regulation of the Agreements, if a company has a number of tax regimes--and, in this case, the Agreements allow for this--the Company is obligated to show why is it that it's not applying the general regime.*\n\n*So, SUNAT is going to say: 'How have you calculated Project A, B, or C?' And SUNAT is going to say: 'I'm going [to] review this.' Of course the Tax Authorities are not going to do the accounting for the Company.*1116\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, p. 2696, line 21 to p. 2697, line 15.\n\n828.\n\nSMCV having failed to provide separate accounts, the Tribunal concludes that SUNAT did not inappropriately assess taxes on SMCV concerning the Leaching Project.\n\n829.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal concludes that none of the disputed Tax and Royalty Assessments breached the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n**B. The Claimant's claim that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the TPA**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n830.\n\nThe second major issue to be determined in this Award concerns the Claimant's claim that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the TPA. The Parties' allegations with respect to this claim overlap in major parts with their allegations with respect to the alleged violation of the 1998 Stability Agreement. The Tribunal will, thus, refer to its above findings where relevant to avoid repetition.\n\n831.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the Respondent violated Article 10.5 of the TPA:\n\n- each time the Royalty Assessments became final and enforceable against SMCV (**1**);\n\n- each time it failed to waive the assessment of penalties and interest against SMCV (**2**);\n\n- each time it failed to reimburse SMCV for its GEM overpayments (**3**).\n\n832.\n\nIn what follows, the Tribunal will assess each of these claims in turn.\n\n**1. The Claimant's claim that the Respondent violated Article 10.5 of the TPA each time the Royalty Assessments became enforceable against SMCV**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n833.\n\nThe Claimant raises four issues in relation to the Royalty Assessments:\n\n- Whether the Respondent frustrated Freeport's and SMCV's legitimate expectations (**a**);\n\n- Whether the Respondent's actions were arbitrary and based on political calculations (**b**);\n\n- Whether the Respondent's actions were inconsistent and non-transparent, (**c**); and\n\n- Whether the Tax Tribunal committed serious due process violations (**d**).\n\n**a) The Claimant's claim that the Respondent frustrated Freeport's and SMCV's legitimate expectations**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n834.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the TPA because the Respondent frustrated the Claimant's and SMCV's legitimate expectations.1117\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 368 *et seq.*; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 145 *et seq.*; Claimant's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 35 *et seq.*, 55.\n\n835.\n\nWith respect to the applicable standard for legitimate expectations under the TPA, the Claimant submits that tribunals have repeatedly acknowledged that the minimum standard of treatment is an evolving concept, and that its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment is today \"*not materially different*\u201d from the treaty-based \"*fair and equitable treatment*\u201d standard as it has been interpreted by international investment tribunals.1118 The Claimant avers that there is no dispute that Article 10.5 of the TPA incorporates by reference obligations under customary international law and does not create an autonomous treaty-based standard.1119 The Claimant's position is that the content of the customary international law minimum standard of fair and equitable treatment is, today, largely co-extensive with the \"*core components*\u201d of fair and equitable treatment that tribunals have repeatedly recognized when interpreting autonomous, treaty-based fair and equitable treatment provisions.1120 The Claimant refutes the Respondent's reliance on *Neer v. Mexico* and notes that the Respondent's interpretation of the minimum standard of treatment as conduct that amounts \"*to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency*\u201d1121 has been rejected by tribunals interpreting investment treaties that incorporate the customary international law minimum standard of treatment.1122\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 361, referring to: *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomikasyon Hixmrylrti A.S. v.

Ecuador*, *Clayton/Bilcon v. Canada*, *Abengoa v. Mexico*, and *Eco Oro v.

To the contrary, tribunals have concluded that outside of the context of nationality-shopping, which is not at issue here, corporate restructurings subsequent to an investment do not affect the content of the underlying substantive claims.1131\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 368 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 146.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 156-158; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 146; Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., Annual Report 2006 dated 15 March 2007 (**CE-902**), p. 25; Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., Annual Report 2007 dated 17 March 2008 (**CE-903**), p. 5; SEC Filing, Freeport Completes Acquisition of Phelps Dodge Corp. dated 19 March 2007 (**CE-29**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 146, referring to: *Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy de Levi v.

Accordingly, SMCV and Phelps Dodge reasonably understood that the specific guarantees of stability that Peru granted to the Cerro Verde Mining Unit, both the Mining and Beneficiation Concessions, applied by virtue of the 1998 Stability Agreement to all investments made within the Cerro Verde Mining Unit, including the Concentrator. The Claimant submits that it was \"*objectively reasonable*\u201d for Phelps Dodge and SMCV to maintain the expectation that Peru would apply stability guarantees to SMCV's entire mining unit, made up of the Mining and Beneficiation Concessions, just as it had done in all prior cases to that point.1133\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 147.\n\n841.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Peruvian officials knew from the outset that SMCV understood that the Concentrator would be stabilized and officials frequently confirmed SMCV's understanding. For example:1134\n\n- Ms. Chappuis testifies that, in discussions in 2004, she explicitly confirmed to representatives from SMCV and Phelps Dodge that the 1998 Stability Agreement would apply to the planned Concentrator.1135 Mr. Tovar's attempts to discredit Ms. Chappuis's testimony by arguing that he was not present in the meetings where Ms. Chappuis made these confirmations is irrelevant given his ancillary role in the process compared to Ms. Chappuis.1136 The Respondent's further attempt to discredit Ms. Chappuis' confirmations because they were \"*oral*\u201d is meritless because there is no basis for the Respondent's suggestion that a representation must be written in order for an investor to reasonably rely on it.1137 Following Ms. Chappuis' explanation of the process to include the Concentrator within the existing Beneficiation Concession, SMCV applied for that expansion and obtained its approval in writing\u2014exactly as Ms. Chappuis had described.1138\n\n- The DGM approved the expansion of the Beneficiation Concession to include the Concentrator, instead of requiring SMCV to include it in a separate Beneficiation Concession and without any suggestion that the Concentrator would be subject to a separate legal regime.1139 The expansion approval explicitly confirmed that the Concentrator fell within the Beneficiation Concession, which was already stabilized under the existing Stability Agreement.1140 Phelps Dodge and SMCV viewed the DGM's approval as officially confirming their understanding that the Concentrator would fall under the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement.1141 Ms. Chappuis had specifically told SMCV and Phelps Dodge representatives that the approval of the expansion would provide confirmation that the Concentrator would benefit from the stabilized regime.1142\n\n- In October 2004, around the same time the DGM expanded the Beneficiation Concession, Peru's President lauded the investment in the Concentrator, calling it a \"*new conquest of an investment for Peru*\u201d and confirming that Peru would \"*fulfill our responsibility to maintain economic and legal stability*.\u201d1143 President Toledo made his statement reaffirming Peru's commitment to legal stability one day after SMCV and Phelps Dodge's Boards of Directors conditionally approved the Concentrator investment, but before they actually proceeded with the investment.1144 The construction of the Concentrator did not commence until December 2004, after SMCV received approval of the Beneficiation Concession, the reason why the prior approvals were \"*conditional*.\u201d1145 In any event, SMCV's and Phelps Dodge's expectation that Peru would honor the 1998 Stability Agreement and apply the stabilized regime to the Concentrator was \"*objectively reasonable*.\u201d1146\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 370.\n\nChappuis I (**CWS-3**), \u00b6\u00b6 52-53; Chappuis II (**CWS-14**), \u00b6\u00b6 37, 40.\n\nChappuis II (**CWS-14**), \u00b6 41.\n\n*Eco Oro v.

Rather, Article 10.5.2 of the TPA clearly states that \"*[t]he concept[] of 'fair and equitable treatment' [\u2026] do[es] not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by [the customary international law minimum standard of treatment], and do[es] not create additional substantive rights*.\u201d To adopt the Claimant's position that the FET standard in the TPA is the same as an autonomous FET standard would deprive both (i) the phrase \"*in accordance with customary international law*\u201d in Article 10.5.1 and (ii) the entirety of Article 10.5.2 of the TPA, of their plain and ordinary meaning.1155\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 617 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 921 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 619; TPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.5.\n\n845.\n\nAs a 2007 UNCTAD Report on Fair and Equitable Treatment explained, \"*[t]he actual practice of application of FET clauses by arbitral tribunals has drawn a distinction solely between FET as an unqualified standard and the FET obligation linked to the minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law*\u201d\u2014\"*where the FET obligation is not expressly linked textually to the minimum standard of treatment of aliens, many tribunals have interpreted it as an autonomous, or selfstanding one*\u201d and \"*[i]nstead of deriving the content of the standard from its original source (customary international law), these tribunals chose to focus on the literal meaning of the provision itself*.\u201d1156 The Respondent further relies, among others, on *Glamis Gold v. United States*, where the tribunal held \"*that it may look solely to arbitral awards\u2014including BIT awards\u2014that seek to be understood by reference to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, as opposed to any autonomous standard*\u201d, because it was dealing with a treaty that limited the FET protections to the MST, and it determined that arbitral decisions dealing with autonomous FET provisions did not provide guidance on that standard.1157 The *Cargill v. Mexico* tribunal similarly dismissed as irrelevant arbitral decisions interpreting FET provisions with autonomous treaty language.1158\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 620; *Fair and Equitable Treatment: UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II*, 2012 (**RA-31**), p. xiv.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 620, referring to: *Glamis Gold v.

Mexico*, Award (**RA-29**), \u00b6 278.\n\n846.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant cites to a number of cases that were not brought under treaties with FET provisions textually limited to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment (among others, *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*, *Duke Energy v. Ecuador*, *Occidental Exploration v. Ecuador*, *Electrabel v. Hungary*, *Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan*, and *Murphy v. Ecuador*). According to the Respondent, other than *S.D. Myers v. Canada*, which was repudiated by the contracting parties to the instrument under which that case was brought, the Claimant has not pointed to any case in which a tribunal was tasked with applying an FET provision limited to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment and abandoned that duty by applying an autonomous FET standard.1159\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 930.\n\n847.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, FET provisions limited to the minimum standard of treatment are breached only by particularly egregious State conduct.1160 Professor Borchard observed that the minimum standard sets an absolute floor of treatment, which ensures that States' treatment of aliens does not fall below \"*a civilized standard*.\u201d1161 As explained by the tribunal in *Neer v. Mexico*, for State action to breach this standard, the action should amount \"*to an outrage, to bad faith, to willful neglect of duty, or to an insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency*.\u201d1162 The Respondent submits that the *Neer* standard has been relied on by tribunals to describe the full scope of a State's obligations to protect investors and their investments (for example the *Thunderbird v. Mexico*, *Glamis Gold v. United States*, *Cargill v. Mexico*, and *Al Tamimi v. Oman* tribunals).1163\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 624 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 625; Edwin Borchard, \"The 'Minimum Standard' of the Treatment of Aliens,\u201d in 33 AM.

Mexico* tribunal, for instance, observed that:\n\n*Notwithstanding the evolution of customary law since decisions such as [the] Neer Claim in 1926, the threshold for finding a violation of the minimum standard of treatment still remains high, as illustrated by recent international jurisprudence. For the purposes of the present case, the Tribunal views acts that would give rise to a breach of the minimum standard of treatment prescribed by the NAFTA and customary international law as those that, weighed against the given factual context, amount to a gross denial of justice or manifest arbitrariness falling below acceptable international standards.*1165\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 627.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 627-628, referring to: *Thunderbird v.

Mexico*, Award (**RA-29**), \u00b6 296.\n\n849.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent submits that FET provisions limited to the minimum standard of treatment do not provide many of the protections that the Claimant seeks to invoke.1166 The FET obligation under the TPA includes only those rules of treatment that have crystallized into customary international law.1167 The Respondent argues that customary international law requires both State practice and *opinio juris*.1168 Relevant State practice must be extensive and virtually uniform, and must also be accepted as law, with States performing the practice out of a sense of legal obligation. Both State practice and *opinio juris* must be demonstrably present in order \"*to support a finding that a relevant rule of customary international law has emerged*.\u201d1169 The Respondent submits that arbitral awards may contain helpful analysis of State practice and *opinio juris*, and can be considered for that purpose, but they cannot by themselves substitute for actual evidence of State practice and *opinio juris*.1170 As the *Glamis Gold v. United States* tribunal noted, \"*[a]rbitral awards [\u2026] do not constitute State practice and thus cannot create or prove customary international law*.\u201d1171 Furthermore, the Respondent relies on Professor Hersch Lauterpacht's statement that \"*[d]ecisions of international courts are not a source of international law*,\u201d nor are they *\"direct evidence of the practice of States or of what States conceive to be the law*.\u201d1172 The burden is on the party seeking to rely on the rule to establish its existence, which, here, is the Claimant. The Respondent avers that the Claimant has failed to meet this requirement.1173 The Respondent argues that individual States may decide expressly by treaty to extend protections under the rubric of \"*fair and equitable treatment*\u201d beyond those required by customary international law. However, unless and until the extension of such protections represents both a widespread State practice and one that is taken out of a sense of international legal obligation, any such protections are provided by those States independently and of their own volition.1174\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 630 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 632; TPA (**CA-10**), Annex 10-A.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 633.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 633; Michael Wood (Special Rapporteur), *Second Report on Identification of Customary International Law*, A/CN.4/672, International Law Commission dated 22 May 2014 (**RA-38**), \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 937.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 936, referring to: *Glamis Gold v.

Even if Article 10.5 of the TPA were read to provide the specific protections that the Claimant seeks to invoke, the applicable standards are still rigorous.1175 According to the Respondent, the Claimant must establish that the Respondent's treatment of SMCV fell \"*far below international standards*.\u201d1176 Specifically, the Respondent disputes that legitimate expectations are protected under the customary international law standard. The Respondent submits that it is not aware of general and consistent State practice and *opinio juris* establishing an obligation under customary international law not to frustrate investors' legitimate expectations. The Claimant has therefore failed to prove that States have an obligation to avoid frustrating investors' legitimate expectations as a matter of customary international law. Even assuming that the Tribunal finds that the protection of legitimate expectations is provided for in Article 10.5's promise of FET (despite its limitation to the MST), the Claimant still must prove that (1) it held specified, objectively reasonable, and legitimate expectations about the treatment they would receive from Peru at the time it made the investment, (2) it made its investment in reliance of those legitimate expectations, and (3) the Respondent's subsequent actions frustrated those basic and legitimate expectations that led to the investment.1177\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 941 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 941 *et seq.*, referring to: *Alex Genin, Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S.

According to the Respondent, the claim is fatally flawed, because it is based on other entities' expectations.1178 Specifically, the Claimant is seeking to rely on the expectations that other entities supposedly held when they invested in the Concentrator years before the Claimant ever made its investment (and, years before the TPA was signed or entered into force). The Respondent avers that the Claimant has failed to explain why it has any right to rely on those other entities' alleged expectations and the Tribunal should reject its attempt to do so.1179 The Respondent further notes that the Claimant has not cited to a single case in which a tribunal found an FET breach based on the frustration of a third party's legitimate expectations.1180\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 670.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 670.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 973.\n\n852.\n\nEven if the Claimant could \"*inherit*\u201d the expectations of others, the Claimant's legitimate expectations claim must fail because any expectation that Phelps Dodge or SMCV had that the 1998 Stability Agreement would cover the Concentrator Project was not objectively reasonable.\n\n853.\n\nIn particular, SMCV and Phelps Dodge could not reasonably have relied upon the Mining Law and Regulations in forming their expectations. The Mining Law clearly provided that the stability guarantees are limited to the investment project outlined in the feasibility study and SMCV could not reasonably have relied upon the Mining Law in forming its expectations.1181\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 671; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 974.\n\n854.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's reference to a statement by the President of Peru \"*laud[ing]*\u201d the investment in the Concentrator and confirming that Peru would \"*fulfill [its] responsibility to maintain economic and legal stability*,\u201d the Respondent notes that this statement came after SMCV's decision to invest in the Concentrator.1182 The Respondent notes that the Claimant argues that the statement was issued only \"*one day after SMCV and Phelps Dodge's Boards of Directors conditionally approved the Concentrator investment,*\u201d but that this is still irrelevant as SMCV and Phelps Dodge did not rely on this statement to make their investment decision.1183 For a legitimate expectations claim to succeed, a claimant must show, *inter alia*, that the investor relied on that expectation in making its investment, which imposes a temporal aspect on the analysis as the expectation must have been formed at (or before) the time that the investment is made. It would be logically impossible for an investor to rely upon statements in making an investment if those statements were made after the investor had made the investment. Accordingly, the Respondent concludes that the President's statements are irrelevant.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 672; Claimant's Memorial, \u00b6 370I; \"Peru: President Toledo Announces an Investment of US$850 Million in Cerro Verde,\u201d *Europa Press* dated 12 October 2004 (**CE-471**).\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 974; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 147(b).\n\n855.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's reference to the DGM's approval of the expansion of the Beneficiation Concession to include the Concentrator, the Respondent avers that this decision had no bearing whatsoever on the scope of the stability guarantees under the 1998 Stability Agreement, which was limited to the Leaching Project as described in the feasibility study.1184\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 673; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 974.\n\n856.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's reference to statements allegedly made by Ms. Chappuis to SMCV officials, the Respondent avers that the Claimant does not point to any contemporaneous evidence that these statements were made.1185 In fact, the contemporaneous evidence actually shows that, on 8 September 2003, the DGM sent a report to SMCV officially notifying it that \"*the application of the Stabilized Regime is granted to the Cerro Verde Leaching Project and not to the company*.\u201d1186 The witness statements referred to by the Claimant confirm that, at the relevant time, both SMCV officials and Ms. Chappuis knew that Mr. Polo, the Vice Minister of Mines, *i.e.*, Ms. Chappuis' boss, and the drafter of the relevant language of the Mining Law, and, therefore, MINEM, held the position that stability guarantees are limited to the investment project in the feasibility study and that the Concentrator Project would not be covered by the guarantees in the 1998 Stability Agreement.1187 Mr. Polo and Mr. Tovar both confirm MINEM's position at that time.1188\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 674; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 974.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 974; MINEM, Report No. 509-2003-MEM-DGM-TNO dated 8 September 2003 (**CE-398**), p. 1, numeral 4.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 675.\n\nPolo I (**RWS-1**), \u00b6 38; Tovar I (**RWS-3**), \u00b6 11.\n\n857.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimant ignores the following evidence that put (or, at a minimum, should have put) SMCV and Phelps Dodge on notice of MINEM's position prior to the decision to construct the Concentrator:1189\n\n- On 23 September 2002, SUNAT issued a public report in response to an inquiry of a taxpayer that stated that \"*Tax Stability Contracts entered into pursuant to Title Nine of the TUO of the General Mining Law only stabilize the applicable tax regime with respect to the investment activities that are the subject matter of the agreements, for their execution in a determined concession or an Administrative-Economic Unit*.\u201d1190 According to the Respondent, SMCV's own presentations that Claimant claims were shown to MINEM in 2004 prove that the company (and Phelps Dodge) was aware of the existence and content of this report.1191\n\n- On 15 September 2003, DGM sent a report to SMCV stating: \"*[a]bout the question whether the stabilized regime would be applicable to the company, the prohibition contained in Article 8 of Supreme Decree No. 027-98-EF points out that the application of the Stabilized Regime is granted to the Cerro Verde Leaching Project and not to the company and the Regime is the one described in the aforementioned agreement*.\u201d1192\n\n- On 11 March 2004, Mr. Polo stated during his presentation at the Royalties Forum that: \"*[s]tabilization agreements are not granted per company, that is important to clarify. A company can have [a] stabilization agreement for one project and not have it for another [project], or [can] have an old activity that does not have a stabilization agreement and a new one that does.

According to the Respondent, the Tribunal can conclude that no reasonable, objective person would rely on the informal, oral statement of a single official (even assuming Ms. Chappuis actually made those statements) when (1) the department's official position, contrary to the alleged statement, has already been made clear in a written letter to the person from the very official on whom the person is otherwise relying, (2) the person knows that the official's superior, and the official's agency, has directly contradicted that statement on numerous occasions, and (3) the person requested that the official put the statement in writing and the official declined.1194\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 977.\n\n**(3) The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n859.\n\nThe NDP submits that the minimum standard of treatment is an umbrella concept reflecting a set of rules that, over time, has crystallized into customary international law in specific contexts.1195 Relying on *SD Myers v. Canada*, the NDP argues that the standard establishes a minimum \"*floor below which treatment of foreign investors must not fall*.\u201d1196\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 14.\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 14, referring to: *S.D.

Italy)* case, the NDP argues that examples of State practice include relevant national court decisions or domestic legislation dealing with the particular issue alleged to be the norm of customary international law, as well as official declarations by relevant State actors on the subject.1199\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 15.\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 15.\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 16, referring to: *Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v.

A formulation of a purported rule of customary international law based entirely on arbitral awards that lack an examination of State practice and *opinio juris* fails to establish a rule of customary international law as incorporated by Article 10.5 of the TPA.1201 The NDP submits that the burden is on the claimant to establish the existence and applicability of a relevant obligation under customary international law that meets the requirements of State practice and *opinio juris*.1202 Once a rule of customary international law has been established, a claimant must then show that the respondent State has engaged in conduct that violates that rule.1203 According to the NDP, currently, customary international law has crystallized to establish a minimum standard of treatment in only a few areas.1204\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 17.\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 18.\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 19.\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 20.\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 28.\n\n862.\n\nThe NDP states that the concept of legitimate expectations is not a component element of FET under customary international law and does not give rise to independent host State obligations.1205 The NDP submits that it is aware of no general and consistent State practice and *opinio juris* establishing an obligation under the minimum standard of treatment not to frustrate investors' expectations; instead, something more is required.1206 An investor may develop its own expectations about the legal regime governing its investment, but those expectations impose no obligations on the State under the minimum standard of treatment.1207\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 28.\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 29.\n\nNDP submission, \u00b6 29.\n\n**(4) The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n863.\n\nArticle 10.5 of the TPA provides:\n\n*1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.*\n\n*2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of \"fair and equitable treatment\u201d and \"full protection and security\u201d do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligation in paragraph 1 to provide:*\n\n*(a) \"fair and equitable treatment\u201d includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and*\n\n*(b) \"full protection and security\u201d requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.*\n\n*3. A determination that there has been a breach of another provision of this Agreement, or of a separate international agreement, does not establish that there has been a breach of this Article.*1208\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.5.\n\n864.\n\nAnnex 10-A of the TPA further provides:\n\n*The Parties confirm their shared understanding that \"customary international law\u201d generally and as specifically referenced in Article 10.5 results from a general and consistent practice of States that they follow from a sense of legal obligation. With regard to Article 10.5, the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens refers to all customary international law principles that protect the economic rights and interests of aliens.*1209\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Annex 10-A.\n\n865.\n\nThe Parties and the NDP disagree as to whether the customary international law minimum standard of treatment, which includes FET, comprises legitimate expectations. This issue is debated in both arbitral case law and academia.1210 The Tribunal finds that it can leave this issue open as even under the standard advanced by the Claimant, the Claimant fails to meet the threshold of showing that its legitimate expectations were breached by the Respondent.\n\nSee *Waste Management v. Mexico*, Award (**CA-269**), \u00b6 98; *Glamis Gold v. USA*, Award (**RA-30**), \u00b6\u00b6 614, 616; *Fair and Equitable Treatment: UNCTAD Series on Issues in International Investment Agreements II*, 2012 (**RA-31**), p. xiv.\n\n866.\n\nThe Claimant submits that a breach of legitimate expectations consists in a State's failure to honor an investor's legitimate expectations by abrogating the legal framework on which the investor party reasonably relied when making an investment.1211 The Claimant relies *inter alia* on *Murphy v. Ecuador* to argue that such legitimate expectations may derive from specific representations made to the investor, or may be \"*based on an objective assessment of the legal framework absent specific representations or promises made by the State to the investor*.\u201d1212\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 368 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 368, referring to: *Murphy v. Ecuador*, Partial Final Award (**CA-279**), \u00b6 248.\n\n867.\n\nIn accordance with this authority, the Tribunal applies the following three prong test to determine whether the Claimant's claim is founded:\n\n- Did the Respondent create expectations that were legitimate, *i.e.,* objectively reasonable?\n\n- Did SMCV and Phelps Dodge rely on those legitimate expectations at the time the investment was made?\n\n- Did the Respondent frustrate the Claimant's legitimate expectations?\n\n868.\n\nAgain, the Tribunal finds that, even under the standard advanced by the Claimant, the Claimant does not satisfy the standard of showing that the Respondent created legitimate expectations that SMCV and Phelps Dodge relied on at the time the investment was made, and that those were frustrated.\n\n869.\n\nFirst, even assuming that a legal framework can form the basis for legitimate expectations, the existing legal framework prior to the investment in the Concentrator did not make clear that the Mining Law's stability guarantees were granted to the entire mining unit or concession(s). Rather, as stated above in paras. 698 *et seq*., the stability guarantees are granted to the specific mining project set out in the investment program in the feasibility study. Both the Mining Law and Regulations as well as the 1998 Stability Agreement make clear that stability guarantees only apply to investments set out in the investment program in the feasibility study. In the case of SMCV, the stability guarantees of the 1998 Stability Agreement only extended to the Leaching Project. As Mr. Davenport testified during the Hearing, the reference in the 1998 Stability Agreement to the Leaching Project was even \"*the elephant in the room*\u201d for Phelps Dodge.1213 Accordingly, the Respondent could not have created expectations through its existing legal framework.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 837 line 13 to p. 838, line 2.\n\n870.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal is not convinced that the Respondent confirmed SMCV's understanding that the Concentrator would be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement. As stated above (see above, paras. 762 *et seq.*), the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not proven that Ms. Chappuis represented that the Concentrator would be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement through the extension of the Beneficiation Concession. Moreover, even if Ms. Chappuis would have shared her opinion that the Concentrator was stabilized, the Claimant was aware that Ms. Chappuis was doing so outside of the realm of her powers and in contradiction to MINEM's official position. In any event, the extension of the Beneficiation Concession did not have the effect of extending the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement and was necessary to construct the Concentrator, as confirmed by the Claimant's witnesses.1214 Neither SMCV's request to expand the Beneficiation Concession nor MINEM's approval of the expansion even mention the 1998 Stability Agreement.1215 Mr. Davenport was asked by the Tribunal whether MINEM expressly stated that the expansion of the beneficiation concession \"*will shield the sulfide operation from the Royalty*,\u201d1216 to which he replied that this was \"*implied.*\u201d1217 However, legitimate expectations are not formed by \"*implied*\u201d or subjective beliefs.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 613, lines 10-18; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 713, lines 12-21.\n\nSMCV, Petition No. 1487019 to MINEM dated 27 August 2004 (**CE-457**); MINEM, Report No. 784-2004-MEM-DGM/PDM and Directorial Order No. 1027-2004-MEM-DGM/PDM dated 26 October 2004 (**CE-476**).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 810, line 21 to p. 811, line 2.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 811, lines 3-4.\n\n871.\n\nThe fact that the President of Peru stated that Peru would \"*fulfill [its] responsibility to maintain economic and legal stability*\u201d also does not constitute a specific representation by the Respondent that the Concentrator would fall under the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement. In any event, the Tribunal notes that such statement was made after the investment in the Concentrator and is, therefore, irrelevant in assessing legitimate expectations.\n\n872.\n\nFurthermore, contrary to the Claimant's argument, the Tribunal does not find that SMCV's and Phelps Dodge's investment was made \"*in reliance on the reasonable expectation that Peru would honor those guarantees*.\u201d1218 Ms. Torreblanca and Mr. Davenport confirmed at the Hearing that one of the decisive factors in building the Concentrator was the reinvestment of profits benefit, which was granted by MINEM.1219 By contrast, the stabilization of revenues from the Concentrator under the 1998 Stability Agreement was \"*not the more weighty thing for the Shareholder at that time*\u201d according to Ms. Torreblanca.1220 This in itself is sufficient to conclude that there was no reliance by SMCV or Phelps Dodge on the 1998 Stability Agreement's coverage of the Concentrator. The Tribunal has considered, in particular, the following evidence:\n\n- The decisiveness of the reinvestment of profits benefit is spelled out in the 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study, which Ms. Torreblanca testified to be a determinative document,1221 as well as in the 2004 Feasibility Study.1222 The 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study spells out that \"*[t]he potential of the reinvestment of profit option granted to Cerro Verde under the existing stability agreement could have a significant affect on the future cash flows and valuation of the sulfide project*.\u201d1223 The only major recommendation in relation to the 1998 Stability Agreement included in the \"*recommendations*\u201d section of the Study is to \"*[i]mmediately negotiate with the government to ensure the reinvestment of profit tax credit outlined in the existing stability agreement between [Cerro Verde] and the Peruvian government*.\u201d1224\n\n- By contrast, there are no recommendations made in relation to an amendment of the 1998 Stability Agreement to include the Concentrator. The Claimant further recognized that the 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study explicitly assumed that the 1998 Stability Agreement would not apply to the Concentrator.1225 This shows that in 2002, there could have been no reliance by SMCV or Phelps Dodge on the inclusion of the Concentrator in the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement. Moreover, as stated above (para. 783), the Claimant's witnesses recognized that legal advice concerning the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement had been sought when preparing the 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study.1226 However, such legal advice is redacted in the 2002 Pre-Feasibility Study and the Tribunal is, thus, unable to conclude but has considerable doubts that such advice was supportive of SMCV's and Phelps Dodge's interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement.\n\n- The 2004 Feasibility Study and its update also recognize the reinvestment of profits benefit as part of its financial analysis and sensitivities.1227\n\n- However, the Tribunal has not seen any evidence from the 2004 Feasibility Study that it addressed details regarding the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement and whether the Concentrator would be covered by it. In fact, the 2004 Feasibility Study only assumed that the Concentrator would be covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement because Fluor was instructed to assume this in the Study.1228 Fluor made clear in the 2004 Feasibility Study that \"*[a]uditing from the standpoint of taxation or accounting is not within Fluor's scope of services*.\u201d1229 Accordingly, while the Tribunal notes that the coverage of the Concentrator under the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement was an assumption made by SMCV and Phelps Dodge, such subjective assumptions are not sufficient to found legitimate expectations.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 371.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 634, line 21 to p. 635, line 15; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 733, line 10 to p. 735, line 18.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 635, line 4-15.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 614, lines 17-19.\n\nFluor Canada Ltd., Feasibility Study: Cerro Verde Primary Sulfide Project dated May 2004 (**CE-20**), Vol. I, p. 55.\n\n2002 Pre-Feasibility Study (**CE-928**), p. 17.\n\n2002 Pre-Feasibility Study (**CE-928**), p. 7.\n\nClaimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 64(b).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 620, lines 10-17; Hearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 838, lines 1-8.\n\nFluor Canada Ltd., Feasibility Study: Cerro Verde Primary Sulfide Project dated May 2004 (**CE-20**), Vol. I, p. 55; Fluor, SMCV Primary Sulfide Project Feasibility Study Project Update dated September 2004 (**CE-459**), p. 46.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 3, p. 732, lines 10-21.\n\nFluor Canada Ltd., Feasibility Study: Cerro Verde Primary Sulfide Project dated May 2004 (**CE-20**), Vol. IV, p. 14-1.\n\n873.\n\nFinally, in light of the copper prices at the time of the investment, in the words of Mr. Rabolvsky, the Concentrator Project turned SMCV's USD 1.7 billion mining operation into a USD 10.7 billion operation.1230 Accordingly, the Tribunal finds it likely that even if SMCV or Phelps Dodge had held the accurate belief that the Concentrator was not covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement, they would have nevertheless proceeded with the construction of the Concentrator given the financial incentive to do so. Notably, the Claimant even invested in 2012 in a second concentrator and, for this purpose, entered into the 2012 Stability Agreement,1231 which stabilized its investment of USD 3.57 billion in the new concentrator.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 7, p. 2174, lines 11-19.\n\n2012 Stability Agreement (**CE-644**).\n\n874.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that even under the standard of Article 10.5 of the TPA argued by the Claimant, the Claimant has not proven that the Respondent created legitimate expectations that SMCV and Phelps Dodge relied on, and that those were breached. The Tribunal, thus, finds no violation of Article 10.5 of the TPA in this respect.\n\n**b) The Claimant's claim that the Respondent's actions were arbitrary and based on political calculations**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n875.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the TPA because the Respondent's actions were arbitrary and based on political calculations.1232\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 373 *et seq.*; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 148 *et seq.*\n\n876.\n\nWith respect to the applicable standard, the Claimant submits that the FET standard includes protection against arbitrary conduct.

The Claimant refers to the following examples:1238\n\n- In April-May 2004, Congressman Diez Canseco argued that existing stability agreements should be \"*reviewed and renegotiated*\u201d in relation to the proposed royalty, and another member of Congress proposed a draft royalty bill that explicitly applied to \"*mining titleholders [\u2026] who have [\u2026] stability agreements*.\u201d1239\n\n- After the Royalty Law was passed in June 2004, and the Government proposed additional amendments that would have softened its impact on the mining sector, members of Congress accused the Government of intentionally delaying the law's entry into force, calling it \"*unreasonable and unacceptable*.\u201d1240\n\n- In early 2005, members of Congress continued to argue that stability agreements did not protect mining companies from paying royalties, characterizing them as \"*fair compensation for the extraction of a non-renewable natural resource*.\u201d1241\n\n- In August 2006, members of Congress proposed amending the Royalty Law so that companies with stability agreements would be obliged to pay royalties.1242\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 374.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 374.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 374 (a);

Congress, Draft Bill No. 14792/2005-CR dated 21 June 2006 (**CE-536**), pp. 2, 5.\n\n880.\n\nThe Claimant submits that this backlash was frequently directed not only at SMCV, but at MINEM, SUNAT, and the MEF, and against specific Government officials.1250 The Claimant refers to the following examples:1251\n\n- In 2004, after then-Minister of Economy and Finance Pedro Pablo Kuczynski publicly opposed the royalty, the royalty's proponents accused him of being an \"*advocate for multinational companies*\u201d and of lobbying on behalf of \"*private companies*.\u201d1252\n\n- On 17 January 2005, Congressman Diez Canseco requested Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda to provide him, with the \"*greatest urgency*,\u201d information about the \"*incentives*\u201d that were granted for SMCV's investment in the Concentrator and the \"*technical and legal basis and cost-benefit analysis*\u201d supporting MINEM's approval.1253\n\n- On 23 February 2005, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda responded to Congressman Diez Canseco, \"*inform[ing]*\u201d him that SMCV \"*ha[d] signed with the Peruvian State*\u201d a Stability Agreement \"*valid until 2013*.\u201d1254 He attached an aide memoire, which praised the Concentrator investment for \"*allow[ing] an increase of more than 200% in [SMCV's] copper production*,\u201d engaging a \"*large number of workers*\u201d \"*which will benefit the population of the area*,\u201d and generally creating a \"*positive effect \u2026 in the economic activation of services, hotels, restaurants, transportation, communications, health, etc*.\u201d1255\n\n- In early 2005, Congressman Diez Canseco published articles in the national press strongly criticizing the MEF and MINEM for what he viewed as failing to \"*defend[] the State's income*,\u201d accusing them of being complicit with the mining lobby, and calling for \"*sit-ins*\u201d before the courts.1256\n\n- On 1 April 2005, Peru's Constitutional Tribunal upheld the Mining Royalty Law, holding that the royalty was not a tax but constituted an \"*administrative charge*.\u201d1257\n\n- On 6 April 2005, Congressman Diez Canseco published an article in *La Rep\u00fablica* applauding the decision, and noting that \"*the recognition that the mining royalty is NOT tax \u2026 means that it must be universally applied without being stymied or distorted by tax stability agreements signed behind Peruvians' backs*.\u201d1258\n\n- On 14 April 2005, Mr. Isasi issued his Report in response to the Constitutional Tribunal's decision. Mr. Isasi's April 2005 Report confirmed that a mining company would be exempt from paying royalties for the \"*mining concessions of which it is the titleholder*\u201d if those concessions were \"*part of a project set out in a stability agreement signed prior to the enactment of [the Royalty] Law.*\u201d The Claimant argues that this makes clear that MINEM had not yet adopted the position that only specific investments within a concession were entitled to stability.1259\n\n- On 22 April 2005, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda informed the press that he had sent MEF and SUNAT information on the \"*mining companies that signed administrative guarantees with the State*.\u201d1260 He also noted that MINEM and MEF intended to make a joint statement to resolve the \"*state of uncertainty*\u201d about which mining companies were exempt from royalty payments.1261\n\n- On 29 April 2005, Mr. Polo sent an internal email to Mr. Isasi, copying other MINEM officials, in which he mentioned that MEF had organized a meeting with MINEM and SUNAT presumably to discuss a response to the decision by the Constitutional Tribunal.1262 Mr. Polo attached a draft of a proposed joint news release by the two Ministries and SUNAT that he wanted to propose to Min. S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda. In the email, Mr. Polo asks Mr. Isasi to \"*take the lead on the communication*.\u201d The Claimant submits that the Respondent did not produce Mr. Isasi's response or any further communications regarding Mr. Polo's proposed draft and the joint draft news release does not appear to ever have been issued.1263\n\n- On 6 May 2005, Minister of Economy and Finance Kuczynski announced that the Constitutional Tribunal's classification of the royalty as an \"*economic consideration*\u201d meant that it would still fall within the guarantee of \"*administrative stability*\u201d for companies like SMCV that had mining stability agreements.1264\n\n- On 3 June 2005, Mr. Isasi emailed a draft \"*final presentation*\u201d to Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda titled, \"*Mining Royalties: Proposals for Modifying the Law and the Effects of the Judgement of the Constitutional Tribunal*,\u201d noting that the draft reflected the agreement of Mr. Isasi, Mr. Tovar, and another MINEM official.1265 The presentation recognized that stability guarantees are granted to \"*investors protected by a 'Contrato-Ley,'*\u201d that \"*Administrative Stability is granted to some investors*,\u201d and that \"*Clause 9*\u201d of the Model Stability Agreement guarantees benefits \"*applicable to the investor*.\u201d1266\n\n- On 8 June 2005, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda made his presentation on the effects of the judgment of the Constitutional Tribunal before the Energy and Mines Congressional Committee.1267 According to the Claimant, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda acknowledged both the political push to enact a royalty scheme against mining profits, and that \"*great expectations have been generated at a national level*\u201d by the Royalty Law and that \"*mining royalties had the majority support of almost 90 votes from all the political forces*.\u201d1268 The Claimant submits that nothing in this presentation confirmed the Respondent's novel position that stability guarantees were limited to the investment program contained in the feasibility study.1269 Instead, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda repeatedly confirmed that the royalty would be calculated based on concessions, and that companies would be entitled to stability for the \"*mining projects*\u201d for which they had signed stability agreements.\n\n- On 25 August 2005, Congressman Diez Canseco began publishing additional articles, this time targeting SMCV directly. For example, in another article in *La Rep\u00fablica* entitled \"*Questions about Cerro Verde*,\u201d Congressman Diez Canseco stated that \"*[t]here are too many questions that beg to be answered by the Ministry of Energy and Mines, the regional authorities and the company itself*\u201d such as why SMCV was granted the reinvestment of profit benefit or why SMCV was exempted from royalty payments.1270\n\n- On 15 September 2005, Congressman Or\u00e9 requested Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda to provide, among others, \"*information relating to the legal stability agreement entered into with the mining company Phelps Dodge about the Cerro Verde mine*.\u201d1271\n\n- On 16 September 2005, the press reported statements by Congressman Diez Canseco demanding that Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda revoke SMCV's authorization to reinvest profits, and \"*demand[] \u2026 that Cerro Verde comply with the payment of royalties*,\u201d threatening to file \"*a compliance action or process*\u201d or to \"*denounce [Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda] constitutionally*\u201d if he failed to do so.1272 Documents produced by Peru reveal that Congressman Diez Canseco also apparently sent a letter to Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda reiterating these threats.1273 However, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has failed to produce Congressman Diez Canseco's letter, despite the fact that it was responsive to the Claimant's document requests.1274\n\n- On 19 September 2005, Congressman Diez Canseco made a motion to create a Congressional Committee to investigate \"*possible irregularities*\u201d relating to \"*the granting of tax benefits*\u201d to SMCV's Concentrator and reiterated his accusations.1275 The motion sought to \"*establish [\u2026] administrative and legal responsibilities*\u201d for MINEM's \"*questionable decision*\u201d to grant the profit reinvestment benefit to SMCV. Congressman Diez Canseco's motion was ultimately adopted by the Congressional Energy and Mines Commission, resulting in the creation of the Congressional Working Group to investigate Cerro Verde on 5 October 2005.1276\n\n- On the same day, Mr. Isasi sent an email marked as \"*high*\u201d importance to several MINEM officials, including Mr. Tovar, in which he forwarded a presentation by Congressman Diez Canseco on \"*Cerro Verde and its Implications for Arequipa*.\u201d In the presentation, the Congressman questioned the \"*justification for granting Cerro Verde II [\u2026] a tax benefit that was repealed 4 years ago*\u201d and the \"*correct[ness]*\u201d of \"*the Central Government in Lima deciding on its own to grant Cerro Verde a tax privilege that affects the interests of Arequipa*.\u201d1277 In the same email, Mr. Isasi attached for comments the draft of a presentation for Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda to Congress.1278 In the draft presentation, Mr. Isasi stated that the 1998 Stability Agreement \"*only applied to the Leaching Project*\u201d and for the first time took the position that \"*the project of primary sulfides of Cerro Verde does not form part of the stabilized regime*\u201d covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement, a position that directly contradicted MINEM's confirmation to SMCV a year earlier that the Concentrator would be entitled to stability guarantees if it formed part of the stabilized Beneficiation Concession.1279 Mr. Isasi's draft slides also contradicted the view he himself had taken five months earlier in his April 2005 Report, in which he stated that \"*mining concessions [\u2026] depending on whether or not they are part of a project set out in a stability agreement signed prior to the enactment of [the Royalty] Law*\u201d \"*will be exempt or not from the payment of royalties*.\u201d1280 The Claimant submits that the Respondent does not contend that Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda actually gave this presentation before Congress and there is no evidence that he did.1281\n\n- On 20 September 2005, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda stated to the press that Cerro Verde would have to pay royalties related to the Concentrator, but he did not say why that would be the case.1282 The Claimant submits that this was the first time MINEM made any such public statement.\n\n- On 22 September 2005, Mr. Isasi sent Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda his Report responding to Congressman Or\u00e9's request for information on SMCV's stability guarantees, which confirmed that SMCV's reinvestment benefit had been correctly approved.1283\n\n- On 26 September 2005, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda wrote to Congressman Diez Canseco to respond to the Congressman's allegations of unconstitutional conduct against him.1284 In his response, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda attempted to deflect the pressure by claiming that the Congressman's criticism was misdirected because MINEM was not \"*the competent body*\u201d for administering the Mining Royalty Law and encouraged Congressman Diez Canseco to direct his requests to MEF and SUNAT. The Claimant argues that the Minister's position was at odds with the position that the Respondent advances in this arbitration, *i.e.,* that MINEM was the relevant authority to determine whether companies were exempt from paying royalties due to stability agreements.\n\n- On 30 September 2005, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda sent Congressman Diez Canseco copies of the \"*technical file*\u201d for the Concentrator, in response to a communication from the Congressman that the Claimant submits the Respondent has failed to produce.1285\n\n- On 3 October 2005, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda responded to Congressman Or\u00e9's 15 September 2005 letter asserting without support that \"*the Primary Sulfide Project will not enjoy the tax, exchange-rate and administrative stability regime, since for said Project the signing of an Agreement for Promotion and Guarantee of Investment has not been applied for.*\u201d In the Claimant's view, this contrasts to his previous claim that assessing the royalty issue fell outside MINEM's jurisdiction.1286\n\n- On 5 October 2005, the Congressional Working Group to investigate Cerro Verde was created, after the Committee on Energy and Mines considered and \"*unanimously approved*\u201d the motion to \"*investigate the alleged tax benefits received by Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde*\u201d and \"*adopt the appropriate measures.*\u201d1287\n\n- On 24 October 2005, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda responded to a request from the Coordinator of the Working Group to investigate Cerro Verde, Congressman Olaechea, for a report on the \"*tax benefits*\u201d granted to SMCV for the Concentrator. In his response, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda stated that SMCV had not requested or been granted any benefits applicable to the Concentrator.1288\n\n- On 31 October 2005, Congressman Diez Canseco rejected the Minister's assertion that MINEM was not \"*competent*\u201d to \"*ensure the due collection of the Mining Royalty*.\u201d1289 The Congressman stated that the Ministry had a \"*political responsibility*\u201d to \"*guarantee*\u201d royalty collections, and reiterated his request for information on the measures MINEM had taken to \"*ensure the collection of mining royalties*,\u201d including for \"*specific cases such as \u2026 Sociedad Minera Cerro Verde S.A.A*,\u201d demanding that MINEM respond with the \"*utmost urgency*.\u201d1290\n\n- On 8 November 2005, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda responded to the Congressman confirming that the Government would pursue royalty payments from SMCV.1291\n\n- On 16 January 2006, Mr. Isasi sent an internal report to Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda to address Congressman Diez Canseco's request for information on the measures MINEM had taken to \"*ensure the collection of mining royalties*.\u201d1292 The report noted that the DGM provided \"*necessary technical support*\u201d to SUNAT by providing a \"*monthly*\u201d \"*list of mining titleholders and their respective production units*.\u201d The Claimant submits that the report said nothing about providing information relating to specific investment projects. On 15 February 2006, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda forwarded Mr. Isasi's report to Congressman Diez Canseco.1293\n\n- On 24 April 2006, *La Rep\u00fablica* published an article on the political debates about requiring the \"*big companies*,\u201d including \"*Cerro Verde*\u201d to pay royalties.1294 The article displayed a graphic attributed to MINEM listing SMCV as a stabilized mining company that would not pay royalties until 2013. The article also quoted the President of the Congressional Energy and Mines Commission, Juan Valdivia, complaining about SUNAT's lack of \"*political will*\u201d to enforce the collection of royalties on companies with stability agreements, and noted that Mr. Valdivia planned to \"*summon the head of SUNAT, Nahil Hirsh [\u2026] to explain the reason for her approach*.\u201d1295 It further noted that despite political pressure, \"*[MINEM] consider[ed] that the approach of the mining companies [was] correct, since stability agreements protect the company \u2026 from administrative modifications*,\u201d and quoted Mr. Tovar as acknowledging that this approach reflected its \"*respect for the signed [stability] agreements*.\u201d1296\n\n- On 3 May 2006, Mr. Isasi made a presentation to the Working Group of the Congressional Energy and Mines Committee, in which he laid out the same argument made in his June 2006 Report. The Energy and Mines Committee also discussed the royalty issue in its full session. According to the Claimant, the transcripts of that session reflect the significant pressure to collect royalties from stabilized companies, as MINEM officials faced questions from members of Congress about why ten mining companies with stability agreements identified by SUNAT were \"*paying absolutely nothing*,\u201d demands that MINEM \"*explain to us why these important companies do not pay mining royalties to our country, to our people*,\u201d and accusations that the Government was \"*harming the nation*.\u201d1297 The session also featured a presentation by Vice Minister of Mines R\u00f3mulo Mucho on behalf of Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda.1298 According to the Claimant, this presentation is largely similar to the \"*final presentation*\u201d that Mr. Isasi circulated for Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda in June 2005, but key differences between the two slide decks demonstrate MINEM's development of its novel position over the course of that year to justify its objective of assessing royalties for the Concentrator in response to sustained pressure.1299\n\n- In June 2006, 5,000 Arequipa residents and municipal and regional politicians protested at Cerro Verde against the profit reinvestment \"*benefit[,] granted unlawfully by the Ministry of Energy and Mines*.\u201d1300 During the protests, the mayor of Arequipa \"*warned*\u201d the central government, threatening \"*an open-ended regional strike*\u201d later that month if it failed to \"*respon[d]*\u201d to the political outcry over the \"*loss of [...] tax revenue from Cerro Verde\u201d* that *\"the Peruvian State suffered*.\u201d1301\n\n- On 16 June 2006, Mr. Isasi issued his report setting out the legal position that stability guarantees \"*[are] granted to an investment project clearly delimited by the Feasibility Study and agreed to in the agreement*.\u201d1302\n\n- On 20 July 2006, Dante Mart\u00ednez Palacios, a local union leader in Arequipa, filed a complaint against SMCV through SUNAT's internal complaint procedure challenging SMCV's use of the reinvestment benefit.1303 On 25 July 2006, Mr. Martinez Palacios filed additional submissions arguing that SUNAT had \"*distort[ed] the regulations*\u201d in granting SMCV's request to use the benefit, \"*allowing undue enrichment*,\u201d and through \"*cunning, distracted [popular] attention*\u201d away from the issue, evading SUNAT's \"*responsibility*\u201d to \"*defen[d] ... the rights of the Peruvian people ... who are the true owners of copper and other wealth and natural resources in our country*.\u201d1304\n\n- On 12 November 2007, Mr. Mart\u00ednez Palacios, filed another complaint before SUNAT alleging that SMCV \"*fraudulent[ly]*\u201d applied the profit reinvestment benefit to the Concentrator.1305 Mr. Mart\u00ednez subsequently laid out these charges in detail in press articles in January 2008.1306\n\n- On 20 November 2007, SUNAT requested MINEM to provide it with a \"*list of parties obligated to pay mining royalties*.\u201d1307\n\n- On 29 January 2008, MINEM provided SUNAT with the \"*information of entities that are obligated to pay mining royalties*\u201d and enclosed, among other documents, Mr. Isasi's June 2006 Report setting forth MINEM's position on the scope of stability guarantees.1308\n\n- In May 2008, SUNAT initiated an audit of SMCV.1309 On 17 August 2009, SUNAT issued its first Royalty Assessments in which it relied on MINEM's conclusion that SMCV's Concentrator was not protected by the 1998 Stability Agreement.1310\n\n- In April 2009, Mr. Mart\u00ednez also filed claims against SUNAT before the Contentious Administrative Courts, accusing SUNAT of improperly exempting SMCV from tax and royalty payments and decrying SUNAT's \"*systematic reluctance to comply with its duties to assess and collect taxes and royalties evaded by SMCV*.\u201d1311\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 376.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 376;

Notably, three years after issuing its first Royalty Assessment against SMCV, SUNAT advised taxpayers that stability guarantees applied to the \"*concession[s] or economic administrative unit[s]*\u201d covered by a stability agreement.1314 According to the Claimant, neither the Respondent nor its witness Ms. Bedoya have anything to say about why SUNAT took action against SMCV only after MINEM sent SUNAT Mr. Isasi's June 2006 Report, noting that \"*[t]his information is sent considering the implications that the [Stability Agreement] might have on the payment of Mining Royalties corresponding to the Primary Sulfides Project*.\u201d1315\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 151.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 153.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 153; SUNAT, Report No. 084-2012-SUNAT/4B0000 dated 13 February 2020 (**CE-883**), p. 3.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 153; MINEM, Report No. 077-2008-MEM-DGM dated 29 January 2008 (**CE-573**).\n\n882.\n\nThe Claimant argues that although the Government initially defended stability guarantees,1316 it ultimately reversed course and adopted its novel and restrictive interpretation of SMCV's Stability Agreement. According to the Claimant, the evidence demonstrates that this volte-face resulted from the intense domestic political pressure. The Claimant refers to the following examples:1317\n\n- After Congressman Diez Canseco threatened to file a constitutional complaint against Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda if he did not revoke SMCV's reinvestment benefit, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda made statements to the press asserting that the Concentrator would not be protected by SMCV's existing Stability Agreement. Several weeks later, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda sent a letter to Congressman Or\u00e9 taking the position that SMCV would have to pay royalties for the Concentrator, without providing any legal support.1318\n\n- Mr. Isasi's June 2006 Report, which according to the Claimant for the first time set out the novel and restrictive interpretation that \"*stabilization is not \u2026 for a specific mining concession, but in relation to a specific project*,\u201d directly contradicted his earlier legal report from April 2005, which confirmed that it is the \"*concessions*\u201d that are \"*part of a project subject to a stability agreement*\u201d that would be exempt from the Royalty Law.1319 According to the Claimant, Mr. Isasi offered no explanation for this reversal, which came after several months of intense public campaigning against SMCV and the Congressional Working Group. Mr. Isasi's June 2006 Report also aligned his opinion with that taken by Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda in his October and November 2005 letters responding to the intense political pressure from members of Congress.1320\n\n- One month after Mr. Mart\u00ednez filed his claims in 2007 alleging that SMCV had colluded with SUNAT to avoid royalty payments and demanding that SUNAT impose royalties on SMCV, SUNAT asked MINEM to provide a \"*list of parties obligated to pay mining royalties from June 2004 to date*.\u201d1321\n\n- In January 2008, after Mr. Mart\u00ednez published a critical article highlighting his claims before SUNAT, MINEM provided SUNAT with, among others, Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda's November 2005 letter and Mr. Isasi's June 2006 Report setting out his novel and restrictive interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement. The Claimant submits that as soon as SUNAT received these documents, it initiated an audit of SMCV and issued its first Assessments only months later, explicitly acknowledging that it had relied on MINEM's designation that SMCV owed royalties for the Concentrator.1322\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 377; Constitutional Tribunal, Decision, Case No. 0048-2004-PI/TC dated 1 April 2005 (**CE-490**), \u00b6 109; MINEM, Report No. 153-2005- MEM/OGAJ dated 14 April 2005 (**CE-494**), \u00b6 16; \"Mining Royalties to Be Defined over the Next Few Days,\u201d *Arequipa Al D\u00eda* dated 6 May 2005 (**CE-500**); MEF, Evaluation of Royalty Application dated 11 March 2004 (**CE-19**), p. 10.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 377.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 377 (a); Minister: Cerro Verde Expansion Subject to Royalty, BUSINESS NEWS AMERICAS dated 20 September 2005 (**CE-511**); MINEM, Report No. 1725-2005-MEM/DM dated 3 October 2005 (**CE-515**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 377 (b); MINEM, Report No. 156-2006-MEM/OGJ dated 16 June 2006 (**CE-534**); MINEM, Report No. 153-2005-MEM/OGAJ dated 14 April 2005 (**CE-494**), \u00b6 17.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 377 (b); MINEM, Report No. 1725-2005-MEM/DM dated 3 October 2005 (**CE-515**); MINEM, Report No. 2004-2005-MEM/DM dated 8 November 2005 (**CE-519**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 377 (c); SUNAT Report No. 261-2007-SUNAT/2E0000 dated 20 November 2007 (**CE-568**), p. 1; MINEM Report No. 1169-2007-MEM-DGM dated 14 December 2007 (**CE-570**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 377 (d); MINEM Report No. 077-2008-MEM-DGM) dated 29 January 2008 (**CE-573**); SUNAT, Inductive Letter No. 108052004279 dated 30 May 2008 (**CE-577**); SUNAT, Fine Assessments Nos. 052-002-0003607 to 052-002-0003631, 2006/07 Royalty Assessment dated 17 August 2009 (**CE-31**); SUNAT, Resolution No. 055-014-0001290/SUNAT, 2006/07 Royalty Assessment dated 31 March 2010 (**CE-38**), p. 25.\n\n883.\n\nThe Claimant concludes by noting that even if MINEM adopted its novel and restrictive position on the scope of stability guarantees in 2005, or began to formulate that position, it still did so after it had provided SMCV with assurances to the contrary; after SMCV made its decision to invest in the Concentrator and started to construct the Concentrator and after the political campaign against SMCV's entitlement to stability guarantees for the Concentrator was already well under way. Furthermore, according to the Claimant, the Respondent has not pointed to a single example of Government entities advancing their \"*consistent*\u201d position prior to SMCV's decision to invest in the Concentrator and the commencement of its construction, to the exception of a SUNAT Report issued in 2002.1323 The Claimant adds that contrary to the Respondent's contention, the evidence on the record confirms that as early as January 2005, Congressman Diez Canseco was demanding that Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda answer to him regarding SMCV's stability guarantees, and by March 2005, was publishing incendiary articles in a Peruvian newspaper targeting MINEM, MEF, and SMCV.1324\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 154 (a) and fn. 754.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 154 (b); \"Mining Royalties: Sleeping with the Enemy,\u201d *La Rep\u00fablica* dated 2 March 2005 (**CE-485**).\n\n884.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent's politically-motivated and baseless *volte-face* in its application of the Mining Law and Regulations was an abrupt departure from the existing legal framework and the Government's prior practice, which had always been to apply *stability* guarantees to entire concessions or mining units.1325 The Tax Tribunal's resolutions upholding SUNAT's Royalty Assessments on the basis of Peru's novel position likewise contradicted MINEM's prior confirmation that the Concentrator would be entitled to stability guarantees when it approved SMCV's request to expand the Beneficiation Concession. The Respondent's decisions to uphold the Royalty Assessments on the basis of this arbitrary, inconsistent conduct constituted violations of the Respondent's obligation of fair and equitable treatment.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 155.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's position**\n---------------------------------\n\n885.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it breached its FET obligation under Article 10.5 of the TPA through arbitrary behavior.1326\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 677 *et seq*.; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 979 *et seq.*\n\n886.\n\nWith respect to the applicable standard, the Respondent submits that the customary international law minimum standard of treatment does not require that states refrain from acting in an arbitrary manner, but, rather, prohibits outrageous,1327 \"*grossly unfair*,\u201d1328 or \"*egregious and shocking*\u201d treatment.1329 The Claimant must prove, at a minimum, that the measures it identifies did not serve \"*any apparent legitimate purpose*,\u201d were \"*not based on legal standards*,\u201d were \"*taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker*,\u201d or were \"*taken in wilful disregard of due process*.\u201d1330 A State's action is not arbitrary just because it is based on political considerations.1331 Rather, the Claimant must prove that the measure evidences manifest impropriety and raises questions about the Respondent's adherence to \"*the rule of law*\u201d itself.1332\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 634 (b), referring to: *Neer v.

Even if a change by the Respondent could have been established in fact, the Claimant would still be very far from establishing that such a policy change would be grossly arbitrary in violation of Article 10.5 of the TPA.1335\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 677 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 687.\n\n889.\n\nThe Respondent avers that the politics surrounding the enactment of the Royalty Law and the Government's decision to grant SMCV's profit reinvestment request in December 2004 discussed by the Claimant have no bearing on the allegation of the Claimant's claim with respect to the interpretation of the scope of stability agreements.1336\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 678.\n\n890.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent submits that the Claimant identifies little evidence in support of its theory that the Respondent reversed course and adopted a novel and restrictive interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement. The Respondent argues that it has consistently and transparently interpreted the 1998 Stability Agreement (and the Mining Law and Mining Regulations) to cover only the investment project that was the basis for obtaining the Agreement (namely, the Leaching Project described in the feasibility study).1337\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 678; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 980.\n\n891.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant's argument that the Respondent has been inconsistent is proven false by a number of facts:1338\n\n- On 23 September 2002, SUNAT issued the 2002 SUNAT Report, which stated that \"*Tax Stability Contracts entered into pursuant to Title Nine of the TUO of the General Mining Law only stabilize the applicable tax regime with respect to the investment activities that are the subject matter of the agreements, for their execution in a determined concession or an Administrative-Economic Unit*.\u201d1339\n\n- The Respondent communicated its interpretation to SMCV as early as September 2003 as the DGM sent a report signed by Ms. Chappuis to SMCV stating: \"*About the question whether the stabilized regime would be applicable to the company, the prohibition contained in Article 8 of Supreme Decree No. 027- 98-EF points out that the application of the Stabilized Regime is granted to the Cerro Verde Leaching Project and not to the company and the Regime is the one described in the aforementioned agreement*.\u201d1340\n\n- On 11 March 2004, Vice Minister Polo gave a presentation at the Royalty Conference, where he stated that: \"*Stabilization agreements are not granted per company, that is important to clarify. A company can have [a] stabilization agreement for one project and not have it for another [project], or [can] have an old activity that does not have a stabilization agreement and a new one that does. That's how it is, it is not granted for the whole company. An investment above 20 million or above 50 is made, depending on the case, and it grants the right to stabilization for that investment, for that development, not for the whole company*.\u201d1341\n\n- On 8 March 2005, Mr. Tovar met with Mr. Harry Conger of Phelps Dodge at a conference in Toronto, where Mr. Tovar told Mr. Conger that Cerro Verde would not pay royalties for the Leaching Project, but it would have to pay royalties for the Concentrator, because it was not covered by any stabilization agreement: \"*it was clear that Cerro Verde would not pay royalties for the Leaching Project, but would pay royalties for the Primary Sulfide Concentrator, as this was not covered by any mining stabilization agreement*.\u201d1342\n\n- On 14 April 2005, Mr. Isasi issued the April 2005 Report explaining that only investment projects are stabilized under stabilization agreements: \"*Emphasis should be placed on this last aspect: The stability granted by the Agreements on Guarantees and Measures to Promote Investment guarantee[s] the legal regime related to tax, currency exchange and administrative matters of the investment project to which they refer. If a mining titleholder has economic administrative units or mining concessions that are not part of the project subject to stability, the regulation establishes that such titleholder must keep the accounting of the project separately. Consequently, it is not the mining titleholder (individuals or legal entity) who will be exempt or not from the payment of royalties, comprehensively as a company, but it will be the mining concessions of which it is the titleholder, depending on whether or not they are part of a project set out in a stability agreement signed prior to the enactment of Law No. 28258. Therefore, only the mining projects referred to in these agreements will be excluded from the royalty calculation basis*.\u201d1343\n\n- On 8 June 2005, Minister of Mines Glodomiro S\u00e1nchez and Mr. Isasi gave a presentation before the Energy and Mines Congressional Committee explaining the relationship between the Royalty Law and mining stabilization agreements, where the Minister indicated that \"*[a]ll mining titleholders pay royalties, but not for all of their projects*.\u201d1344 Mr. Isasi also clarified that \"*it must not be confused who is the obliged subject, which is the company, ... but when determining how much it must pay, the tax administration has to determine what is the reference basis, and to determine the reference basis, it must determine which are the stabilized mining projects and which are the non-stabilized projects*.\u201d1345\n\n- Minister of Mines Glodomiro S\u00e1nchez sent a letter, dated 8 November 2005, to Congressman Diez Canseco, stating that: \"*[i]n the first place, it is necessary to distinguish the legal treatment of the 'Cerro Verde Leaching' project, which is covered by an Agreement on Guarantees and Measures to Promote Investment, from that applicable to the new Primary Sulfide Project in which the profits from that old Leaching project will be reinvested. The Primary Sulfide project does not enjoy protection under any Guarantee or Stability agreement*.\u201d1346\n\n- Mr. Isasi gave a presentation on 3 May 2006, before the Cerro Verde Working Group in Congress during which he explained that: \"*Cerro Verde's primary sulfide project is not part of the Leaching Project, for this reason it does not benefit from the stabilized regime subject of the 13 February 1998 contract. It is a new project that does not benefit from tax, exchange rate and administrative stability. In consequence, the sulfides project will pay royalties when it enters into production.*\u201d1347\n\n- MINEM officials gave presentation during the 23 June 2006 Roundtable Discussion held by Proinversi\u00f3n's Congressional Committee that SMCV representatives attended reiterating its position that the Concentrator Project was not covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement.1348\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 680; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 980.\n\nSUNAT, Report No. 263-2002-SUNAT/K00000 dated 23 September 2002, *available at* https://www.sunat.gob.pe/legislacion/oficios/2002/oficios/i2632002.htm (**RE-26**), p. 3.\n\nMINEM, Report No. 509-2003-MEM-DGM-TNO dated 8 September 2003 (**CE-398**), p. 1.\n\nAudio of C\u00e9sar Polo's Presentation, Mining Royalties Forum, Congress of the Republic dated 11 March 2004 (excerpts) (**RE-185**), at timestamps 00:09:36 - 00:10:03.\n\nTovar II (**RWS-10**), \u00b6 88.\n\nMINEM, Report No. 153-2005-MEM/OGAJ dated 14 April 2005 (**CE-494**), \u00b6 17.\n\nEnergy and Mines Congressional Committee, Congress of the Republic, Meeting Minutes dated 8 June 2005 (excerpts) (**RE-29**), p. 26.\n\nEnergy and Mines Congressional Committee, Congress of the Republic, Meeting Minutes dated 8 June 2005 (excerpts) (**RE-29**), p. 29.\n\nMINEM, Report No. 2004-2005-MEM/DM dated 8 November 2005 (**CE-519**), \u00b6 1.\n\nMINEM, \"Reinvestment of Profits and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated May 2006 (**RE-3**), slide 12.\n\nMINEM, \"Reinvestment of Profits and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated June 2006 (**RE-107**), slide 15.\n\n892.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to show that Peruvian mining and tax authorities interpreted the 1998 Stability Agreement as they did because of any political pressure.1349 The Respondent notes that political pressure could have existed for MINEM to interpret stabilization guarantees a certain way, and MINEM could have acted consistent with the wishes of those applying political pressure, but even that would not prove that MINEM interpreted the stabilization guarantees that way because of the pressure, particularly where Peru's interpretation is documented well before any alleged political pressure began sometime in 2005 or 2006.1350 To the extent that, when it uses the term \"*politically-motivated*,\u201d the Claimant means that the Respondent acted with prejudice against SMCV and specifically targeted it, the Claimant has failed to provide any evidence of such animus on the part of the Peruvian authorities. The Claimant has thus failed to show that any of MINEM's or SUNAT's conduct, whether a change or not, was improperly based \"*on excess of discretion, prejudice or personal preference*.\u201d1351 Finally, given that the Respondent's interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement is consistent with Peruvian law, it is \"*based on legal standards*\u201d and therefore cannot be labeled arbitrary.1352\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 984.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 984.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 985.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 986.\n\n**(3) The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n893.\n\nThe NDP has not provided an express position on the standard of arbitrariness and has, rather, focused its comments on denial of justice (see below, paras. 949 *et seq.*).\n\n**(4) The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n894.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties generally agree on the standard of arbitrariness.1353 In particular, the Parties agree that an action may be arbitrary if it is \"*not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference*.\u201d1354 The Claimant also does not dispute the *ELSI* standard articulated by the Respondent, according to which arbitrariness is \"*something opposed to the rule of law*\u201d and requires \"*a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety*.\u201d1355 The Tribunal will thus proceed to assess the Respondent's conduct on the basis of this standard.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 139; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 951-952.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 139 (a); Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 952, referring to: *EDF v.

Reports 1989 (**RA-72**), \u00b6 128.\n\n895.\n\nThe Parties, however, disagree as to whether conduct \"*based on political calculations*\u201d constitutes arbitrary action.1356 The Tribunal finds the Claimant's argument according to which conduct \"*based on political calculations*\u201d constitutes arbitrary action to be unsupported. Policy decisions of States are, by essence, based on political considerations or \"*calculations*\u201d and these do not *per se* taint State conduct with arbitrariness. In any event, the Claimant has stated that the nuance made with the Respondent's articulated standard amounts to \"*a distinction without a difference*.\u201d1357\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 363; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 654-655.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 139 (a).\n\n896.\n\nThe Claimant's claim based on arbitrariness is founded on the factual premise that the Respondent would have changed its interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement as a result of political pressure, after having assured SMCV that the stability guarantees applied to the Concentrator.1358\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 148 *et seq.*\n\n897.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal has already found that (i) the Respondent did not breach the 1998 Stability Agreement, (ii) the Respondent did not change its interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement, rather, its interpretation was both consistent and public, and (iii) the Claimant has failed to prove that the Respondent assured SMCV that the stability guarantees would apply to the Concentrator (see above, Section V.A.4.)\n\n898.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that there could have been no arbitrariness in the Respondent's conduct as such conduct was based on legal standards. Nothing in the Respondent's conduct conveyed \"*a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety,*\u201d in the words of the *ELSI* judgment.\n\n899.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there was political pressure in Peru in relation to the mining royalty1359 and in particular regarding SMCV's use of the profit reinvestment benefit.1360 The Tribunal also notes that the profit reinvestment benefit granted to Cerro Verde caused a significant shortfall in revenue for the Peruvian State and the Arequipa region and even resulted in protests and strikes.1361 However, the profit reinvestment benefit granted to SMCV, which was one of the decisive factors in building the Concentrator (see above, para. 872), was not revoked, but remained fully in force. In the Tribunal's view, this discredits the Claimant's argument according to which Peruvian authorities would have acted with prejudice against SMCV and without due regard to legal standards in connection to one of the most crucial aspects of the Claimant's decision to invest in the Concentrator. The Tribunal has also found no evidence that Peruvian authorities acted against SMCV as a result of any political pressure. Reference is made in this regard to the testimonies of Ms. Bedoya, Ms. Olano, and Mr. Sarmiento, who all confirmed that they had never been subject to any kind of political pressure or influence.1362\n\nSee *inter alia:* Royalty Law No. 28258 dated 24 June 2004 (**CA-6**);

India* tribunals.1364 The Claimant submits that the Respondent did not owe an affirmative duty of full transparency independent from the fair and equitable treatment obligation; rather the Claimant argues that the Respondent's complete lack of transparency, in circumstances where the lack of transparency was misleading, is an important component of the Respondent's unfair and inequitable conduct resulting in its breaches of Article 10.5 of the TPA.1365 According to the Claimant, transparency is a key component of the fair and equitable treatment obligation, particularly where a lack of transparency can reasonably be expected to mislead the investor, as is the case where, for example, government officials continue to act \"*as if [a] project were on track and it was business as usual,*\u201d when in fact decisions have already been made internally against the company.1366 The Claimant submits that this is also consistent with Chapter 19 of the TPA, which expressly establishes general requirements of transparency on the treaty parties.1367\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 364, referring to: *Windstream Energy v.

Moreover, at the same time, the Government continued to confirm through its conduct SMCV's understanding that the Concentrator was covered. The Claimant refers to the following examples:\n\n- After Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda responded to Congressman Diez Canseco's threats by issuing his 3 October and 8 November 2005 letters taking the position that the Concentrator was not stabilized, a position which had never previously been established in any Government document, MINEM did not share these documents with SMCV or otherwise inform SMCV that it intended to alter its position, even though Ms. Torreblanca was concurrently participating in extensive meetings with the Congressional Working Group relating to the stabilized reinvestment benefit.1372 While Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda made a general statement to the press that the Concentrator would not be stabilized around the same time, SMCV interpreted this as a clear response to the pressure directed at him from Congress and did not understand it to affect SMCV's legal rights.1373\n\n- On 16 June 2006, Mr. Isasi issued the June 2006 Report articulating for the first time the novel interpretation that, under the Mining Law, stabilization guarantees were limited to the investment program set out in the feasibility study.1374 The Government did not provide SMCV with a copy of the June 2006 Report or share the legal basis for Mr. Isasi's conclusions even though only a day earlier, the DGM announced publicly that the planned Roundtable Discussions with SMCV relating to Arequipa's alleged budget shortfall would not have major results because SMCV had a stability agreement, which the Government must honor *\"because we are in a State governed by the rule of law and the Government is determined to attract investments, not scare them away*.\u201d1375\n\n- One week after Mr. Isasi issued the June 2006 Report, both Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda and Mr. Isasi participated in the Roundtable Discussions with SMCV to discuss a *\"harmonious solution\u201d* to the budget shortfall in Arequipa that allegedly resulted from SMCV's application of stability guarantees.1376 Neither Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda, Mr. Isasi, or any other Peruvian official mentioned Mr. Isasi's June 2006 Report or suggested that SMCV would be paying royalties.1377 Instead, the negotiations were based on the understanding that SMCV would not pay any royalties, including on concentrate sales, and that it should therefore make significant contributions to Arequipa.1378\n\n- Government officials continued to express the view that SMCV was entitled to stability with respect to the Concentrator even after SUNAT had issued the initial Assessments, including when Ms. Torreblanca met with officials from the MEF regarding the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments who advised her that SMCV had a \"*strong argument*\u201d and encouraged SMCV's efforts to challenge the assessment.1379\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381 (a); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 53; MINEM, Report No. 1725-2005-MEM/DM dated 3 October 2005 (**CE-515**); MINEM, Report No. 2004-2005-MEM/DM dated 8 November 2005 (**CE-519**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381 (a); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 40; **\"**Minister: Expansion of Cerro Verde subject to royalty tax,\u201d *Business News Americas* dated 20 September 2005 (**CE-511**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381 (b); MINEM, Report No. 156-2006-MEM/OGJ dated 16 June 2006 (**CE-534**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381 (b); \"Advance payment of royalties proposed,\u201d *La Rep\u00fablica* dated 15 June 2006 (**CE-533**); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 51.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381 (c); \"Congressional Pro-Investment Commission seeks solution to demand payment of taxes from Cerro Verde,\u201d *El Heraldo* dated 23 June 2006 (**CE-538**); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381 (c); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381 (c); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6\u00b6 53-54.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381 (d); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 81.\n\n905.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Government also solicited additional contributions premised on the understanding that SMCV enjoyed stability for its entire mining unit, again demonstrating the Government's inconsistent conduct toward SMCV.1380 The Claimant points to the following circumstances:\n\n- SMCV voluntarily contributed USD 125 million to Arequipa following the 2006 Roundtable Discussions, which were premised on the understanding that SMCV would not pay any royalties during the term of the 1998 Stability Agreement.1381\n\n- Despite these significant contributions, the Government requested that SMCV sign the Voluntary Contribution Agreement in January 2007. The Government then induced SMCV's significant contributions under that Agreement, ultimately amounting to USD 140 million, which were premised on the understanding that SMCV would not be subject to any royalty payments.1382 The Government did not mention to SMCV that it would charge SMCV royalties.1383\n\n- In 2011, before committing to make full GEM payments, Ms. Torreblanca asked MINEM's Director General of Mining for \"*urgent confirmation*\u201d that once it did so, SMCV would pay only GEM and not Royalties or SMT.1384 Ms. Torreblanca also conveyed SMCV's understanding that the 1998 Stability Agreement applied to the entirety of the Mining and Beneficiation Concessions through 31 December 2013.1385 Ms. Torreblanca similarly wrote to the MEF asking it to confirm the Government's verbal assurances to SMCV that it would \"*only have to pay the GEM and will pay neither the Special Mining Tax nor the Mining Royalty for the concessions included in the current [Stability] Agreement*.\u201d1386 The Claimant submits that these officials stated that they were not competent to answer her questions.1387 The Claimant argues that the Respondent does not contest that SMCV made millions of dollars in GEM payments following the Government's explicit confirmation that SMCV needed to make either GEM payments or royalty and SMT payments, but not both, a confirmation that the Government repudiated several years later after it had received all of SMCV's GEM payments.1388\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 382; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 160.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 382 (a); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6\u00b6 53-55.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 382 (b); SMCV, Voluntary Contribution Agreement dated 10 August 2007 (**CE-27**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 382 (b); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6\u00b6 60-62.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 382 (c); SMCV, Letter No. SMCV.VL&RG-1896-2011 dated 7 October 2011 (**CE-628**); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 85.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 382 (c); SMCV Letter No. SMCV.VL&RG-1896-2011 dated 7 October 2011 (**CE-628**); SMCV, Letter No. SMCV-VL&RG-1968-2011 dated 26 October 2011 (**CE-629**); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6\u00b6 85-89.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 382 (c); SMCV, Letter No. SMCV-VL&RG-2217-2011 dated 5 December 2011 (**CE-631**); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6\u00b6 85-89.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 382 (c); MINEM, Official Letter No. 1333-2011-MEM/DGM dated 28 December 2011 (**CE-632**); MEF Report No. 206-2011-EF/61.01 dated 14 October 2011 (**CE-629**), p. 2, II. Analysis, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 161.\n\n906.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Respondent does not deny that (i) it withheld key documents from SMCV, (ii) after it began acting against SMCV as a result of political pressure, Government officials repeatedly declined to clarify their intentions regarding assessing royalty payments against SMCV when SMCV requested them to do so, and (iii) the Government did not object when SMCV stated its position that the stability guarantees also applied to its Concentrator investment, a position that was based on MINEM's own confirmation.1389\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 157.\n\n907.\n\nWhile the Respondent asserts that SMCV \"*should have known*\u201d that the Government intended to deny stability guarantees to the Concentrator, the Claimant submits that the relevant question is whether the Respondent's conduct lived up to its obligation of FET to be transparent to SMCV about its intentions.1390 In this regard, the Claimant submits that the Government repeatedly failed to inform SMCV directly of its changed position on the scope of stability guarantees in the multiple meetings that SMCV held with Government officials and in the Government's correspondence with SMCV, and that the Government even continued to confirm SMCV's position during this time. In particular:\n\n- In March 2005, Ms. Torreblanca sent a letter to SUNAT in which she set out SMCV's understanding that the 1998 Stability Agreement applied to \"*Cerro Verde*\u201d in its entirety and that, as a result, SMCV would not be subject to royalties.1391 Shortly after, she reiterated SMCV's understanding in a meeting with Mr. Haraldo Cruz, SUNAT's Regional Intendent for Arequipa.1392 The Claimant submits that the Respondent's argument that SUNAT did not have the power to establish or interpret the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement is directly contradicted by the Royalty Assessments that SUNAT started to issue four years later and by the Respondent's own witness, Ms. Bedoya. Even under the Respondent's alternative narrative that the Government, including SUNAT, \"*from the outset*\u201d interpreted stability guarantees as applying to specific investment projects, SUNAT's silence would violate any notions of transparency, as Mr. Cruz should have corrected Ms. Torreblanca's understanding. That he did not do so means either that he deliberately misled Ms. Torreblanca, or that SUNAT at the time still took the position that stability guarantees applied to concessions and mining units.\n\n- Mr. Tovar alleges that during an 8 March 2005 meeting at a conference in Toronto, he told Phelps Dodge representatives that the Concentrator \"*would have to pay royalties, because it was not stabilized*.\u201d1393 However, Mr. Tovar's claim is contradicted by the two *aide-m\u00e9moires* on which Mr. Tovar relies in support of his assertion, by Ms. Torreblanca's testimony and by the presentation Mr. Conger of Phelps Dodge gave at the Conference the day after meeting Mr. Tovar.1394\n\n- The Respondent also did not share Mr. Isasi's April 2005 Report with SMCV, despite the fact that the Respondent now argues that it represents a clear articulation of the Respondent's position. MINEM failed to disclose it to SMCV and also resisted disclosure under its own Transparency Law and before Peru's Transparency Tribunal.1395 If the Respondent's position that Mr. Isasi's April 2005 Report supported its position were correct, then the Government's failure and resistance to share the April 2005 Report with SMCV would be further evidence of the Government's lack of transparency.1396\n\n- The Respondent also does not contest that it failed to provide SMCV the two letters that Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda wrote to Congressman Or\u00e9 in October 2005 and to Congressman Diez Canseco in November 2005, in which he took the position that the Concentrator would not be entitled to stability guarantees.1397 The Respondent does not contest that it failed to provide these documents to SMCV at the time, despite their clear relevance to SMCV. The Respondent only shared the November 2005 letter with SMCV two and a half years later, in June 2008.1398\n\n- The Respondent concedes that it did not provide Mr. Isasi's June 2006 Report setting out the novel position that stability guarantees were limited to specific investment projects to SMCV at the time it was issued. Rather, MINEM provided SMCV with a copy of the report only two years later, in June 2008. The Respondent's witnesses testify that Mr. Isasi's June 2006 Report was the critical factor in the Government's ultimate determination that SMCV had to pay royalties for the Concentrator.1399 The importance of Mr. Isasi's opinion to the Government's ultimate decisions against SMCV is likewise corroborated by contemporaneous evidence.1400\n\n- Mr. Isasi does not contest that he never provided his report or discussed his position on the scope of stability guarantees under the Mining Law with SMCV before SMCV received a copy of the report in June 2008.1401 This is despite the fact that only ten days after Mr. Isasi published the June 2006 Report, Mr. Isasi and other Government officials, such as Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda, met with SMCV for the Roundtable Discussions.1402\n\n- Mr. Isasi testifies that \"*[he] do[es] not remember exactly what was discussed in each of [the Roundtable Discussion meetings]*,\u201d1403 while Mr. Tovar asserts that during one of these meetings in June 2006, MINEM gave a presentation that stated that \"*stability is given to the investment project clearly delineated by the Feasibility Study and agreed upon in the Contract. It is not granted to the company generally or to the Concession*\u201d and that \"*the presentation was also clear that mining royalties did apply to the Concentrator Project*.\u201d1404 The Claimant submits that Mr. Tovar's assertion is unsupported and contradicted by the evidence. The presentation is undated, and there is no documentary evidence that would show it was presented in the Roundtable discussions.1405 Mr. Tovar alleges it was made during \"*the sessions in June 2006,*\u201d *i.e.*, either the 23 June 2006 session or the 29 June 2006 session, but Mr. Tovar was only present for the 23 June 2006 session.1406 The minutes of that session make clear that the issue of mining royalties was not discussed at that meeting, but rather, reserved for the later sessions; they note that the parties \"*will discuss the applicability of mining royalties to investments in Cerro Verde II [i.e., the Concentrator]*.\u201d1407 Contemporaneous press reports also confirm that following the first meeting, Arequipa leaders who had attended the meeting \"*demanded that the Government order the payment of the mining royalties of Cerro Verde I and II,*\u201d making clear that the Arequipa delegation came away from the meeting with the understanding that SMCV would pay no royalties.1408 Ms. Torreblanca explains that she personally attended the 29 June session and no such presentation was made during that meeting.1409 Further, she was briefed on the 23 June session by her colleagues that attended in person, who did not inform her of any presentation or statements by MINEM of the kind described by Mr. Tovar, as they would have done, given that those statements would have been a clear departure from MINEM's representations to SMCV up to that point and the very purpose of the Roundtable discussions was to obtain contributions from SMCV to compensate for its use of stability guarantees.1410\n\n- The Respondent also does not dispute that Government officials continued to confirm that stability guarantees applied to concessions and mining units even after SUNAT issued its initial assessments against SMCV.1411 Ms. Torreblanca explains that multiple officials she spoke to after receiving SUNAT's assessments and Mr. Isasi's June 2006 Report confirmed that SMCV's position regarding the scope of stability guarantees under the Mining Law and Regulations was correct. These officials include Marisol Guiulfo, the Vice-Minister of Economy, and Liliana Chipoco, MEF's General Director of Public Revenue Policy.1412 Moreover, as late as 2012, long after SUNAT issued its first Royalty Assessment against SMCV, SUNAT issued a report, authored by Ms. Chipoco, which repeatedly confirmed that \"*mining-activity owners that have signed agreements on guarantees and measures to promote investment under the General Mining Law will enjoy a stabilized tax system applicable solely to the concession or economic-administrative unit for which said agreement has been signed*.\u201d1413\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (a).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (a); SMCV, Letter No. SMCV-AL-279/2005 to SUNAT dated 4 March 2005 (**CE-486**); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 32.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (b); Tovar I (**RWS-3**), \u00b6 55.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (b).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (c); Transparency and Access to Public Information Tribunal, Decision, Case No. 00547-2021- JUS/TTAIP dated 16 April 2021 (**CE-884**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (c).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (d).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (d); MINEM, Report No. 2004-2005-MEM/DM dated 8 November 2005 (**CE-519**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (e); Tovar I (**RWS-3**), \u00b6 64; Polo I (**RWS-1**), \u00b6 39.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (e); MINEM, Report No. 077-2008-MEM-DGM dated 29 January 2008 (**CE-573**); SUNAT, Resolution No. 055-014-0001290/SUNAT, 2006/07 Royalty Assessments dated 31 March 2010 (**CE-38**), p. 34.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (f); Isasi I (**RWS-2**), \u00b6 57.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (f).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (g); Isasi I (**RWS-2**), \u00b6 65.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (g); Tovar I (**RWS-3**), \u00b6 67.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (g); MINEM, \"Profit Reinvestment and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated June 2006 (**RE-107**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (g); Congress, Pro-Investment Commission, Minutes of the Session of 23 June 2006 (**CE-537**); Meeting Minutes, Proinversi\u00f3n Commission, Congress dated 29 June 2006 (**RE-51**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (g); Congress, Pro-Investment Commission, Minutes of the Session of 23 June 2006 (**CE-537**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (g); \"Arequipa and Cerro Verde Authorities Seek Solutions,\u201d *El Heraldo* dated 28 June 2006 (**CE-540**), p. 2; Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 53.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (g); Torreblanca II (**CWS-21**), \u00b6 34.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (g); Torreblanca II (**CWS-21**), \u00b6\u00b6 34-35.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (h).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (h); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 81; Torreblanca II (**CWS-21**), \u00b6 44.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (h); SUNAT, Report No. 084-2012-SUNAT/4B0000 dated 13 September 2012 (**CE-883**).\n\n908.\n\nIn response to the Respondent's argument that SMCV \"*should have known*\u201d the Respondent's position on the scope of stability guarantees because SMCV allegedly could have watched on the Congress's CCTV two presentations given by MINEM officials before a Congressional Committee and a Congressional Working Group in which they allegedly stated the Government's new position,1414 the Claimant notes:\n\n- The Respondent does not provide any evidence that these sessions were broadcast to the public when it asserts that they were \"*transmitted via a closed circuit television system*.\u201d1415 The Respondent has also failed to provide any evidence that the sessions of the Committee and the Working Group were open to the public.

Venezuela*, *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela*, and *Deutsche Telekom v. India* cited to among others by the Claimant did not consider FET provisions limited to the MST. The paragraphs from *Windstream v. Canada* to which Claimant cites do not discuss consistency and transparency. In *Metalclad v. Mexico*, while the tribunal did both consider a FET provision limited to the MST and find a violation of said provision because of a lack of transparency, the Claimant fails to disclose that the reviewing court, in part, set aside the award because it rejected the tribunal's determination that there was a transparency obligation in Chapter 11 of NAFTA.1421 In any event, the Respondent states that mere inconsistency or some lack of transparency, on their own, do not breach a FET obligation; much more is required to approach the level of gross arbitrariness or some other specific FET element.1422 The Respondent submits that when tribunals consider the purported inconsistency of State conduct with respect to the FET standard, their analysis is often framed in terms of \"*arbitrary*\u201d or \"*unjustifiable*\u201d acts, which implies State conduct far more severe and reproachable than mere \"*inconsistency*.\u201d1423 Likewise, a high threshold must be met to establish a breach with respect to transparency. According to the Respondent, the transparency requirement \"*cannot mean that [the State] has to act under complete disclosure of any aspect of its operation. It rather means that in relation to a foreign investor, the authorities of the State shall act in a way to create a climate of cooperation in support of investment activities*.\u201d1424\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 634.\n\n*United Mexican States v.

Mr. Isasi explained why the reinvestment benefit did apply to SMCV's Leaching Project, but not to SMCV's Concentrator Project\u2014namely, that the latter was a new and different project from the Leaching Project, which was the investment project that had actually been stabilized in 1998.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 692.\n\n913.\n\nSpecifically, the presentation stated that \"[s]tability is given to the investment project clearly delineated by the Feasibility Study and agreed upon in the Contract. It is not granted to the company generally or to the Concession.\u201d1429 Thus, SMCV and the Claimant were, or at the very least should have been, aware of the Respondent's position before the 2008 date the Claimant alleges in these proceedings. The Respondent adds that the Claimant admits that SMCV was aware of Minister S\u00e1nchez's public statements to the press that the Concentrator would not be stabilized in or around November 2005.1430\n\nMINEM, \"Reinvestment of Profits and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated May 2006 (**RE-3**), slides 8, 12.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 693; Claimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381 (a).\n\n914.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there is also no basis for the Claimant's assertion that soliciting or accepting voluntary contributions and GEM payments was any kind of confirmation by the State that SMCV enjoyed stability for any investments in its entire mining unit (as opposed to just the investment project identified in the 1998 Stability Agreement).1431 Neither those programs nor SMCV's participation in them changed the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement, and Peru did nothing unfair or inconsistent in creating or growing the programs.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 694.\n\n915.\n\nIn relation to the Claimant's points made regarding alleged inquiries from Ms. Torreblanca to MINEM's Director General of Mining and to MEF, the Respondent submits that neither MINEM nor MEF affirmed Ms. Torreblanca's alleged understanding that providing voluntary contributions and making GEM payments meant that all mining investments of SMCV would be exempt from paying royalties.1432\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 695.\n\n916.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, any transparency obligation under Article 10.5 \"cannot mean that it has to act under complete disclosure of any aspect of its operation.\u201d1433 The question would be \"*whether the State acted secretively to conceal its plans or announced those plans openly and with reasonable explanation and detail*. \u201d1434\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 989, citing *Urbaser v.

Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Award dated 4 September 2020 (**RA-154**), \u00b6 418.\n\n917.\n\nThe Respondent denies the Claimant's assertion that the Respondent \"*withheld key documents from SMCV*\u201d. According to the Respondent, the documents relied upon by the Claimant (*i.e.,* the April 2005 Report, the June 2006 Report, and two letters that Minister S\u00e1nchez Mej\u00eda wrote to Congressman Or\u00e9 in October 2005 and to Congressman Diez Canseco in November 2005) all show that the Respondent has been consistent in its interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement.1435 In any event, the Respondent was under no obligation to disclose these particular documents to SMCV. The Respondent is not obligated to turn over every piece of paper it generates that has any bearing on SMCV's or the Claimant's investment. The Respondent's only obligation was to not hide its interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement. According to the Respondent, the evidence shows that the Respondent did not hide or withhold its interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement from SMCV or anyone else.1436 In addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimant admitted in its Memorial that SMCV was aware of Minister S\u00e1nchez's public statements to the press that the Concentrator would not be stabilized in or around November 2005 and that \"*[o]ne of [Ms. Chappuis'] colleagues, C\u00e9sar Polo*,\u201d *i.e*., her boss, took \"*the position that the Concentrator would have to pay royalties*\u201d (which the Claimant says SMCV disregarded on the grounds that it was supposedly \"*politically motivated*\u201d). These facts, including the Claimant's own admissions, are fatal to its transparency claim.1437\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 991.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 992.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 993.\n\n918.\n\nThe events relied on by the Claimant do not support the Claimant's argument, either. Specifically:\n\n- The Claimant relies on an 8 March 2005 meeting at a conference in Toronto. However, during that meeting, Mr. Tovar told Phelps Dodge representatives that SMCV would have to pay royalties on the Concentrator, because it was not stabilized. The Claimant, without any direct evidence, argues that Mr. Tovar's testimony is untrue.1438\n\n- The Claimant also relies on a March 2005 letter from SMCV to SUNAT and claims that \"*Peru and Mr. Cruz do not contest that SUNAT never responded to the letter and that Mr. Cruz did not contradict Ms. Torreblanca's explanation*.\u201d1439 However, the Claimant's assertion is misleading because in February 2005, SUNAT's Regional Intendent for Arequipa, Mr. Haraldo Cruz, sent a letter to SMCV with instructions on how to declare and pay royalties,1440 and, on March 4, 2005, SMCV asserted in response that it was not obliged to pay royalties, since it was exempted by the 1998 Stability Agreement.1441 SMCV's Vice President Ms. Torreblanca met with Mr. Cruz to communicate SMCV's understanding of the 1998 Stability Agreement shortly thereafter.1442 As Mr. Cruz explains in his witness statement, he did not confirm Ms. Torreblanca's interpretation regarding the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement during that meeting.1443 If SMCV wanted to confirm its interpretation, it needed to make such a request in writing. It did not. In any case, the fact that Mr. Cruz did not confirm Ms. Torreblanca's interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement cannot be understood as an endorsement of Ms. Torreblanca's interpretation. The Government informed SMCV on numerous occasions that SMCV's Concentrator Plant was not covered by the Agreement.1444\n\n- The Claimant also relies on the Roundtable Discussions, which took place on 23 June, 29 June, and 10 July 2006.1445 As Mr. Tovar discusses in his witness statement, during the 23 June 2006 meeting, MINEM officials gave a presentation confirming that \"*stability is given to the investment project clearly delineated by the Feasibility Study and agreed upon in the Contract. It is not granted to the company generally or the Concession*.\u201d1446 The Claimant without any direct evidence argues that this presentation did not happen, but those arguments are without merit (and, in fact, the presentation was handed out to meeting participants, including representatives of SMCV).1447\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 995.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 158 (a).\n\nLetter from SUNAT to SMCV dated 17 February 2005 (**CE-482**).\n\nLetter from SMCV to SUNAT, Letter No. SMCV-AL-279/2005 dated 4 March 2005 (**CE-486**).\n\nCruz II (**RWS-14**), \u00b6 22.\n\nCruz II (**RWS-14**), \u00b6\u00b6 2, 22.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 995.

Even if that were not the case, the evidence shows that Peruvian officials did explicitly inform SMCV of the State's interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement on multiple occasions and the Claimant has admitted that SMCV was aware of the State's position. The Respondent submits that the evidence shows that the Respondent satisfied any reasonable obligation of transparency towards SMCV. MINEM officials (i) directly informed SMCV of its interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement and (ii) on multiple occasions, publicly stated the Respondent's interpretation, including before Congress. There was no information shortfall here, much less one that could come anywhere near constituting Treaty-breaching unfair or inequitable treatment.1448\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 996-997.\n\n**(3) The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n920.\n\nAccording to the NDP, the concept of \"*transparency*\u201d has not crystallized as a component of FET under customary international law giving rise to an independent host-State obligation.1449 The NDP is aware of no general and consistent State practice and *opinio juris* establishing an obligation of host State transparency under the minimum standard of treatment.1450\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 30.\n\n**(4) The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n921.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties disagree on whether transparency is a separate component of the FET standard under customary international law. The NDP has also opined on the issue. The Tribunal is satisfied to leave this issue open as even under the Claimant's standard, the Tribunal does not find that the Respondent's conduct amounted to a breach of the FET standard.\n\n922.\n\nThe Claimant argues that a State violates the minimum standard of FET \"*if it fails to act with reasonable consistency and transparency in the treatment of foreign investments*.\u201d1451 According to the Claimant, the Tribunal should assess Peru's conduct as a whole under the FET standard.1452 The Claimant submits that the Respondent completely lacked transparency, in circumstances were the lack of transparency was misleading, and that this breached the FET standard.1453 The Tribunal, thus, proceeds on the basis of this standard.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 364.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 140.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 140.\n\n923.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that there was no complete lack of transparency, as the Claimant argues. The Tribunal reiterates its finding (i) that the Respondent did not breach the 1998 Stability Agreement, (ii) that the Respondent consistently interpreted the 1998 Stability Agreement, and (iii) that SMCV itself had doubts as to whether the Concentrator was covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement (see above, Section V.A.4.).\n\n924.\n\nCrucially, the Tribunal does not find that the Respondent withheld its interpretation of the 1998 Stability Agreement from the Claimant and SMCV. The Tribunal does not find that the evidence on the record suggests that the Government \"*confirm[ed] through its conduct SMCV's understanding that the Concentrator was covered*.\u201d1454\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 381.\n\n925.\n\nThe Tribunal is rather convinced that it was clear both before and after the investment that the Concentrator was not covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement. The Tribunal comes to this conclusion *inter alia* on the basis of the 2002 SUNAT Report,1455 the DGM's letter to SMCV of September 2003,1456 the June 2005 televised presentation before Congress,1457 the publicly reported statement by the Minister of Energy and Mines that the expansion of primary sulfides in the Cerro Verde mine was subject to royalties in September 2005,1458 Mr. Isasi's televised presentation before Congress in May 2006,1459 and Congressman Diez Canseco's draft bill of June 2006, which referred to the Minister of Energy and Mines' November 2005 letter.1460\n\nSUNAT, Report No. 263-2002-SUNAT/K00000 dated 23 September 2002 (**RE-26**).\n\nMINEM, Report No. 509-2003-MEM-DGM-TNO dated 5 September 2003 (**CE-398**).\n\nEnergy and Mines Congressional Committee, Congress of the Republic, Meeting Minutes dated 8 June 2005 (excerpts) (**RE-29**).\n\n\"Minister: Cerro Verde Expansion Subject to Royalty,\u201d *Business News Americas* dated 20 September 2005 (**CE-511**).\n\nAudio of the Cerro Verde Working Group Before the Energy and Mines Congressional Committee dated 3 May 2006 (**RE-103**).\n\nCongress, Draft Bill No. 14792/2005-CR dated 21 June 2006 (**CE-536**), p. 9.\n\n926.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that SMCV could have sought assurances from MINEM in writing or clarifications from SUNAT regarding the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement, but refrained from doing so.1461\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 2, p. 628, line 12 to p. 630, line 12.\n\n927.\n\nThe Tribunal also finds that the Roundtable Discussions during which MINEM made clear that the Concentrator \"*will pay royalties when it enters into production*\u201d1462 do not document a lack of transparency. While the Parties dispute whether the MINEM presentation was actually held during the meeting on 23 June 2006, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not produced compelling evidence that this presentation was not made. Rather, the Claimant relies on the evidence of Ms. Torreblanca, who was not present during the meeting.1463 By contrast, the Respondent has presented both an amicus brief by an attendee of the Roundtable Discussions, who states that the presentation was made,1464 as well as the testimony of Mr. Tovar.1465 In any event, even if this presentation had not been given, the Tribunal finds that the case does not hinge on this evidence, as the presentation is only one further example among many demonstrating that there was no lack of transparency on the part of the Respondent.\n\nMINEM, \"Reinvestment of Profits and Mining Royalties Cerro Verde: Leaching Project and Primary Sulfide Project\u201d dated June 2006 (**RE-107**), slide 15.\n\nTorreblanca II (**CWS-21**), \u00b6\u00b6 33 *et seq.*\n\nFREDICON's Amicus in Dante Mart\u00ednez's Complaint to SUNAT dated 21 May 2008 (**RE-233**), p. 3, Annex A-6.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 6, p. 1601, line 1 to p. 1601, line 3; Tovar II (**RWS-10**), \u00b6 104.\n\n928.\n\nFinally, with respect to the voluntary contributions that SMCV made, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not shown how it was induced into making such payments. In any event, the Respondent cannot be held liable for any errors in judgment committed by SMCV or the Claimant when it made its payments. Moreover, it is undisputed between the Parties that SUNAT reimbursed the relevant GEM amounts for Q4 2012 \u2013 Q4 2013 when it was requested to do so.1466 It only denied the reimbursement of the GEM payment for Q4 2011 \u2013 Q3 2012 on the grounds that the claim for reimbursement was time-barred.\n\nSee for example: Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 204; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1034.\n\n929.\n\nThe Claimant has, thus, not shown to the Tribunal's satisfaction that the Respondent breached its FET obligations under the TPA under this account.\n\n**d) The Claimant's claim that the Tax Tribunal committed serious due process violations**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Claimant's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n930.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the Respondent breached Article 10.5 of the TPA because the Tax Tribunal committed serious due process violations.1467\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 384 *et seq.*; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 163 *et seq.*\n\n931.\n\nWith respect to the applicable standard, the Claimant submits that tribunals have confirmed that an absence of fair procedure or a finding of serious procedural shortcoming in administrative or judicial proceedings violates the minimum standard of treatment. According to the Claimant, due process forms an essential part of the obligation of FET, which is intended \"*to ensure that the legal process governing the protected rights as a whole, including its judicial manifestations, is fair and reasonable, devoid of arbitrariness, discrimination or manipulation to the detriment of those rights*.\u201d1468 The Claimant refers in particular to *TECO v. Guatemala*, *OAO Tatneft v. Ukraine*, *Dan Cake v. Hungary*, and *Lemire v. Ukraine*.1469 According to the Claimant, a due process violation does not necessarily require the finding of a denial of justice.1470 In any event, tribunals have repeatedly recognized that the cumulative effect of repeated procedural shortcomings, involving disregard for the individual circumstances of a particular case, flagrant violations of procedure or law, including those designed to ensure due process, and biased decision-makers, amounts to breaches of the fair and equitable treatment obligation to afford due process or constitutes a \"*denial of justice*.\u201d1471\n\n*OAO Tatneft v.

However, the Tax Tribunal President has no role in deliberating or resolving individual challenges. Instead, challenges must be decided, and the corresponding resolutions must be prepared, exclusively by the *vocales* and their support staff within the Chamber.1475 Despite this limitation, evidence that SMCV first received in 2021 through freedom of information requests demonstrates that the President's Office directly interfered to resolve SMCV's challenges in the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases in favor of the Government. Specifically, the evidence shows that President Olano improperly tasked her assistant with drafting the resolution in the 2008 Royalty Case and ensured that this resolution would be rendered before the resolution in the earlier-filed 2006-2007 Royalty case. The evidence also demonstrates that President Olano then pressured the *vocales* who were in charge of the 2006-2007 Royalty Case to copy-paste the 2008 Royalty Case resolution in the 2006-2007 Royalty Case.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 386 *et seq.*\n\nMEF Internal Regulations, Ministerial Resolution No. 213-2020/EF/41 dated 24 July 2020 (**CA-250**), Article 23; *see also* Hern\u00e1ndez I (**CER-3**), \u00b6\u00b6 186-187.\n\n935.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, contemporaneous internal communications confirm that President Olano charged her assistant Ms. Villanueva with drafting the resolution of the 2008 Royalty Case.1476 The Claimant asserts that the Respondent concedes that Ms. Villanueva drafted the 2008 resolution at the behest of President Olano, but that the Respondent contends that this improper interference was a \"*routine administrative act*.\u201d1477 Second, following President Olano's intervention, the 2008 Royalty Case proceeded on a fast track, ensuring that Ms. Villanueva's resolution would be the first issued, even though the 2006-2007 Royalty Case was the first-filed case and had been pending before the Tax Tribunal nine months longer than the 2008 Royalty Case.1478 According to the Claimant, the Respondent's assertion that such course of events cannot be attributed to President Olano's interference is contradicted by contemporaneous emails.1479 President Olano then seemingly imposed the flawed resolution in the 2008 Royalty Case on the *vocales* of Chamber 10, who issued a copy-pasted resolution in the 2006-2007 Royalty Case only nine days later.1480 According to Articles 103 and 129 of the Tax Code and Article 6.1 of the Law of General Administrative Procedure, the Tax Tribunal Chambers are required to independently deliberate and decide each case individually on the basis of the facts and arguments before them.1481 Although some informal consultation between Chambers is permissible this does not absolve *vocales* of their \"*indispensable duty to deliberate among themselves*\u201d and to decide each individual case \"*impartially and independently*,\u201d as Prof. Hern\u00e1ndez explains.1482 The Claimant submits that contemporaneous internal emails further demonstrate that President Olano pressured Chamber 10 to adopt Ms. Villanueva's resolution.1483\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 390;

Specifically, both Chamber 2's resolution in the 2009 Royalty Case and Chamber 1's resolution in the 2010-2011 Royalty Case copied the sections of the resolution drafted by Ms. Villanueva in the 2008 Royalty Case that related to the novel interpretation of the Mining Law nearly verbatim.1490 The Claimant submits that the Respondent's argument that \"*considering prior resolutions [\u2026] is in no way an abdication of the duty to independently decide cases*\u201d fails to account for the fact that the 2008 resolution was itself not \"*independently*\u201d decided, but drafted by Ms. Villanueva under the direction of President Olano.1491 Moreover, the Respondent presents no evidence that the *vocales* in the latter cases, including the conflicted *vocal ponente* of the 2010-2011 Royalty Case, ever undertook such an independent deliberation.1492\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 397; Tax Tribunal Notice of Oral Hearing, No. 1170-2018-EF/TF dated 18 July 2018 (2010/11 Royalty Assessments) (**CE-185**); Tax Tribunal Notice of Oral Hearing, No. 1065-2018-EF/TF dated 6 July 2018 (2009 Royalty Assessments) (**CE-183**).\n\nTax Tribunal Decision No. 06141-2-2018 dated 15 August 2018 (2009 Royalty Case) (**CE-188**), pp. 8-33; Tax Tribunal Decision No. 08252-1-2013 dated 21 May 2013 (2008 Royalty Case) (**CE-83**), pp. 1-21; Tax Tribunal Decision No. 06575-1-2018 dated 28 August 2018 (2010/11 Royalty Case) (**CE-194**), pp. 15-40.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 172.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 172.\n\n939.\n\nAfter SMCV challenged the Q4 2011 Royalty Case, the case was assigned to Ms. Villanueva, who in the meantime had been promoted to vocal for Chamber 9 as *vocal ponente*.1493 Ms. Villanueva adopted the novel interpretation limiting stability guarantees \"*to a specific investment project that is clearly delimited in the Feasibility Study*\u201d and ruled against SMCV so that SMCV was once again denied the opportunity to have its case properly heard and decided by an impartial decision-maker.1494 The Claimant notes that the Respondent does not contest that, after the President's administrative assistant, Ms. Villanueva, was promoted to vocal, she was assigned to act as the *vocal ponente* of the Q4 2011 Royalty Case.1495 In response to the Respondent's allegations to the contrary, the Claimant asserts that the Q4 2011 Royalty Case was not merely a case involving \"*repeat parties*\u201d and the same decision-maker in the normal course. Rather, Ms. Villanueva's role in the 2008 Royalty Case, as the President's assistant who drafted the 2008 resolution under the President's direction, was improper, and thus disqualified her from serving as vocal in the Q4 2011 Royalty Case. Ms. Villanueva's resolution in the Q4 2011 Royalty Case repeated the same legal argument that she had developed under the direction of President Olano in the 2008 Royalty Case. Contrary to the Respondent's argument, SMCV could not have requested the recusal of Ms. Villanueva in the Q4 2011 Royalty Case because SMCV did not become aware of Ms. Villanueva's role in the 2008 Royalty Case until well after the Tax Tribunal had issued its resolution in the Q4 2011 Royalty Case.1496\n\nTax Tribunal, Resolution No. 10574-9-2019 (Q4 2011 Royalty Case) dated 18 November 2019 (**CE-269**), p. 14.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 399; Tax Tribunal Resolution No. 10574-9-2019, Q4 2011 Royalty Case) dated 18 November 2019 (**CE-269**), p. 6. *Compare id.* with Tax Tribunal, Resolution No. 08252-1-2013 (2008 Royalty Case) dated 21 May 2013 (**CE-83**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 173.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 173; Torreblanca II (**CWS-21**), \u00b6 48.\n\n**(2) The Respondent's position**\n---------------------------------\n\n940.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it breached its FET obligation under Article 10.5 of the TPA through due process violations.1497\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 697 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 998 *et seq.*; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 251 *et seq.*\n\n941.\n\nWith respect to the applicable standard, the Respondent argues that the standard for denial of justice is high and occurs not where a State makes a mistake, but where a State fails to create and maintain a system of justice that assures that foreign investors do not face injustice and are not deprived of the right to correct an injustice.1498 The Respondent notes that the Claimant does not appear to be claiming a substantive denial of justice and rather limits its claims to procedural denial of justice.1499 The Respondent submits that when considering any claim based on acts of the judiciary, it is essential not to lose sight of the bedrock principle that international tribunals do not sit as courts of appeal to hear challenges to or to reverse a respondent state's domestic court's judgments.1500 As the *RosInvestCo v. Russia* tribunal explained, \"*Respondent can only be held liable for denial of justice [\u2026] if the Claimants are able to prove that the court system fundamentally failed. Such failure is mainly to be adopted in cases of major procedural errors such as lack of due process*.\u201d1501 The Respondent also contends that a number of tribunals have observed that \"*the standard of review of the State measure will also vary according to the nature of the decision-making process at issue: administrative proceedings trigger less stringent due process obligations than judicial proceedings*.\u201d1502\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 960.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 663.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 664; *Mondev v.

In addition, the Chambers that decided the appeals against SUNAT's 2006-2007, 2009, and 2010 Royalty Assessments independently deliberated the issues before them prior to deciding the cases. Moreover, the Tax Tribunal did not violate SMCV's due process rights by allowing Mr. Ninacondor to participate as a vocal in the 2010-2011 Royalty Case. Finally, the Tax Tribunal acted reasonably in assigning Ms. Villanueva as *vocal ponente* in the Q4 2011 Royalty Case.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 697 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 998 *et seq.*\n\n943.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant has not established a Treaty breach and could not possibly establish one on any version of the events. The Respondent notes that the Claimant has not asserted a denial of justice claim before the Tribunal with respect to the Respondent's judicial decisions (whether of the first-instance Contentious Administrative Courts, the appellate Superior Courts, or the Supreme Court). The Claimant has expressed disagreement with the contents of certain of those decisions. However, the Claimant has not alleged that the Peruvian courts deprived SMCV of its due process rights in violation of the FET obligations under the Treaty; that claim is directed only to the Tax Tribunal. The Respondent argues that the Claimant has a high bar to prove that the Tax Tribunal acted in such an egregious manner as to constitute a denial of justice in breach of the Respondent's obligations under the TPA.1504\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 699.\n\n944.\n\nThe Respondent claims that the Claimant attempts to construe normal, administrative activities as evidence of nefarious and biased conduct.1505 Even if the Claimant's speculations were true, this still would be insufficient to meet the very high standard required for a finding of a denial of justice at the administrative level, where the alleged affected party could and did appeal the determinations in court (and where no allegations have been made that the affected party has been denied justice in the domestic court proceedings). Thus, the alleged breaches of the Tax Tribunal's Rules of Procedure, even if they had occurred, would be insufficient to establish a Treaty breach.1506\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 700.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 701.\n\n945.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant's claim is also insufficient to amount to a breach of Peru's FET obligations, because the Claimant is complaining about who decided SMCV's 2008, 2006-2007, 2009 and 2010-2011 Royalty Cases, which is, at most, a complaint about independence and impartiality.1507 The Respondent argues that the due process standard is less stringent with respect to administrative proceedings, particularly with respect to the independence of their adjudicators.1508 The Respondent refers to the *Glencore v. Colombia* tribunal, which explained that \"*in administrative proceedings, [\u2026] the decision-maker is often the investigator, the accuser, and the adjudicator, and a related officer (who may be the senior officer of the decisionmaker) is often the one who rules on appeal. Due process does not require strict separation of these functions - provided that the final administrative decision is subject to full judicial review. The private individual must have an opportunity to have the case revisited, this time by an independent and impartial judge, with the guarantee of a formal adversarial procedure.*\u201d1509\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1004.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1005.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 702, referring to: *Glencore v. Colombia*, Award (**CA-245**), \u00b6 1319; See also, *Thunderbird v. Mexico*, Award (**RA-35**), \u00b6\u00b6 200-201.\n\n946.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent submits that SMCV both had and took full advantage of ample opportunities for judicial review of the Tax Tribunal's decisions.1510 The Claimant has not identified a single case in which a tribunal found an FET violation because of a lack of independence on the part of administrative adjudicators. While the Claimant argues that *Glencore v. Colombia* is distinguishable because the administrative bodies in *Glencore* were operating in accordance with Colombian law while Mr. Ninacondor's failure to recuse was unlawful, the Respondent submits that Mr. Ninacondor was not required to be recused under Peruvian law.1511 Even assuming *arguendo* that Mr. Ninacondor should have been recused under Peruvian law, that alone is nowhere near sufficient to constitute an FET breach. First, the Claimant's reading of *Glencore v. Colombia* is incorrect; the tribunal did not focus on whether the administrative body was acting in perfect conformity with law, but, rather, the tribunal was making the general point that administrative conduct often involves officials acting as \"*investigator, the accuser, and the adjudicator,*\u201d exactly what the Claimant is incorrectly alleging Mr. Ninacondor did. Moreover, in addition to failing to show that Mr. Ninacondor actually did work on the 2010-2011 Royalty Case while at SUNAT, the Claimant has not shown or even alleged that Mr. Ninacondor had any bias against SMCV. According to the Respondent, this is important because the Claimant has a high bar to show a due process or procedural denial of justice claim. The Claimant must show more than a single mistake, which, in any case, the Respondent did not make; rather, it must show that the Respondent failed to create and maintain a system of justice that assures that foreign investors do not face injustice and are not deprived of the right to correct an injustice, which the Claimant has not shown.1512\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1005.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1006.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1007; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 662; Jan Paulsson, *Denial of Justice in International Law* (2005) (excerpts) (**RA-25**), pp. 77, 84-87.\n\n- **The Respondent's position on the alleged procedural irregularities in the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n947.\n\nThe Respondent submits that there were no procedural irregularities in the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases1513 and that parts of the Claimant's argument is based on pure speculation.1514 The evidence shows that President Olano appointed an experienced assistant (*asesora*) to assist Chamber 1 due to staffing shortages, that Ms. Villanueva read the file and gave it independent consideration as one would expect of any law clerk, and that the *vocales* in the respective Chambers considered and decided the cases before them and, at least to some degree, coordinated to ensure that the same taxpayer was treated consistently with respect to the same issue.

The Respondent submits that it has difficulty articulating what the Claimant's concern might be with Ms. Villanueva working on the Q4 2011 Royalty Case.1517\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 711 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1003.\n\n**(3) The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n------------------------------------------\n\n949.\n\nAccording to the NDP, an area in which customary international law has crystallized to establish a minimum standard of treatment concerns the \"*obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world*,\u201d as expressly addressed in Article 10.5.2(a) of the TPA.1518\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 21.\n\n950.\n\nThe NDP submits that denial of justice in its historical and customary sense denotes misconduct or inaction of the judicial branch of the government and involves some violation of rights in the administration of justice, or a wrong perpetrated by the abuse of judicial process.1519 By constrast, the NDP submits that a domestic system of law that conforms to a reasonable standard of civilized justice and is fairly administered cannot give rise to a complaint by an alien under international law.1520\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 23, relying *inter alia* on Edwin M. Borchard, *The Diplomatic Protection of Citizens Abroad or the Law of International Claims* (1919), p. 330.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 23.\n\n951.\n\nRelying on *Loewen v. United States*, the NDP argues that a denial of justice may occur in instances such as when the final act of a State's judiciary constitutes a notoriously unjust or egregious administration of justice which offends a sense of judicial propriety.1521 The NDP submits that a denial of justice exists where there is, for example, an obstruction of access to courts, failure to provide those guarantees which are generally considered indispensable to the proper administration of justice, or a manifestly unjust judgement.1522 Corruption in judicial proceedings, discrimination or \"*ill-will*\u201d against aliens, and executive or legislative interference with the freedom of impartiality of the judicial process have also constituted instances of a denial of justice. At the same time, erroneous domestic court decisions, or misapplications or misinterpretation of domestic law, do not in themselves constitute a denial of justice under customary international law. The evolution or development of \"*new*\u201d judge-made law that departs from previous jurisprudence within the confines of common law adjudication do not implicate a denial of justice either.1523\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 24.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 24, relying *inter alia* on Harvard Research Draft, *The Law of Responsibility of States for Damage Done in Their Territory to the Person or Property of Foreigners*, Article 9, 23 AM. J. INT'L L. SP. SUPP. 131, 134 (1929), 178.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 24.\n\n952.\n\nThe high threshold required for judicial measures to rise to the level of a denial of justice in customary international law gives due regard to the principle of judicial independence, the particular nature of judicial action, and the unique status of the judiciary in both international and municipal legal systems. As a result, the actions of domestic courts are accorded a greater presumption of regularity under international law than are legislative or administrative acts. As a matter of customary international law, international tribunals will defer to domestic courts interpreting matters of domestic law unless there is a denial of justice.1524\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 25.\n\n953.\n\nIn this regard, the NDP argues that it is well-established that international arbitral tribunals, such as those established by disputing parties under Chapter 10 of the TPA, are not empowered to be supranational courts of appeal on a court's application of domestic law. Thus, an investor's claim challenging judicial measures under Article 10.5.1 of the TPA is limited to a claim for denial of justice under the customary international law minimum standard of treatment. *A fortiori*, domestic courts performing their ordinary function in the application of domestic law as neutral arbiters of the legal rights of litigants before them are not subject to review by international tribunals absent a denial of justice under customary international law.1525 Accordingly, judicial measures may form the basis of a claim under the customary international law minimum standard of treatment under Article 10.5.1 of the TPA only if they are final and it is proved that a denial of justice has occurred. Were it otherwise, it would be impossible to prevent Chapter 10 tribunals from becoming supranational appellate courts on matters of the application of substantive domestic law, which customary international law does not permit.1526\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 26.\n\nNDP Submission, \u00b6 27.\n\n**(4) The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n954.\n\nArticle 10.5.2(a) of the TPA expressly provides that FET includes \"*the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world*.\u201d1527\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.5.2(a).\n\n955.\n\nThe Parties disagree as to the applicable standard under Article 10.5 of the TPA, and in particular as to whether the minimum standard of treatment goes beyond the standard of denial of justice. The NDP has also expressed its position on the applicable standard. The Respondent has endorsed that willful disregard for due process is constitutive of arbitrariness and of a violation of FET.1528 The Claimant argues that an \"*absence of fair procedure*\u201d or the finding of a \"*serious procedural shortcoming in administrative or judicial proceedings*\u201d are constitutive of a violation of the minimum standard of treatment.1529 Moreover, the Claimant relies, among others, on the finding of the *OAO Tatneft v. Ukraine* tribunal, which found that the obligation of FET is intended \"*to ensure that the legal process governing the protected rights as a whole, including its judicial manifestations, is fair and reasonable, devoid of arbitrariness, discrimination or manipulation to the detriment of those rights*.\u201d1530 In this line, a violation of due process requires the proof of serious procedural shortcomings that are manifestly unfair and unreasonable.1531 The Tribunal finds that it may leave open the issue of which exact standard applies under the TPA. The Tribunal is satisfied that even under the standard advanced by the Claimant, the Claimant's allegations in relation to the purported due process violation are unsubstantiated.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 649.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 365.\n\n*OAO Tatneft v.

The Claimant's allegations with respect to the 2008 and 2006-2007 Royalty Cases**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n957.\n\nWith regard to the 2008 and 2006-2007 Royalty Cases, the Claimant claims that the President of the Tax Tribunal, Ms. Olano, who should have no role in the decision making of the chambers of the Tax Tribunal, interfered to resolve SMCV's challenges by improperly tasking her assistant, Ms. Villanueva, with drafting the resolution in the 2008 Royalty Case. Specifically, the Claimant argues that the appointment of an assistant was not in the powers of the President of the Tax Tribunal, that such an assistant should not have drafted the resolution, and that the evidence shows that Ms. Olano took part in discussions of the merits of the case. The Claimant relies *inter alia* on the testimony of Mr. Estrada and email exchanges between President Olano and Ms. Villanueva as well as between Ms. Villanueva and a SUNAT official.1532\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 390; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 166.\n\n958.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant's submission is inconclusive. Mr. Estrada confirmed during the Hearing that he never worked on any of the cases involving SMCV during the years he worked at the Tax Tribunal.1533 His subjective views as to what should constitute proper procedure before the Tax Tribunal are of no relevance. Moreover, while the email exchanges between Ms. Olano and Ms. Villanueva1534 as well as the resolution itself, which bears Ms. Villanueva's initials,1535 confirm that Ms. Villanueva worked on the 2008 Royalty Case, the Tribunal finds that this is not constitutive of a manifestly unfair or unreasonable procedural shortcoming, irrespective of whether her appointment was proper or not under the applicable rules before the Tax Tribunal. Crucially, the Claimant has not demonstrated that Ms. Villanueva's involvement in the case prohibited the *vocales* who actually adjudicated the 2008 Royalty Case from forming their own independent judgment of the case. Ms. Olano testified at the Hearing that she \"*never interfered with the resolution of the dispute, and I never guided [Ms. Villanueva] to make one decision, for that [r]esolution to be one way or the other, because it would be the 'vocal ponente,' the one making a decision*\u201d1536 and stated that \"*as President, I do not decide on [r]esolutions [reviewed by] the [Tribunal's] Chambers*.\u201d1537\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 4, p. 1053, line 17 to p. 1054, line 1.\n\nEmail from \u00darsula Villanueva Arias to Zoraida Alicia Olano Silva dated 22 March 2013, 4:02 PM PET (**CE-648**); Email from \u00darsula Villanueva Arias to Gabriela Bedoya of SUNAT dated 24 April 2013, 2:37 PM PET (**CE-81**); Email from Zoraida Alicia Olano Silva to Carlos Hugo Moreano Valdivia dated 21 May 2013, 10:47 AM PET (**CE-651**); Email from \u00darsula Villanueva Arias to Licette Isabel Zu\u00f1iga Dulanto dated 29 December 2014, 5:00 PM PET (**CE-679**).\n\nTax Tribunal Decision, No. 08252-1-2013 (2008 Royalty Case) dated 21 May 2013 (**CE-83**).\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 7, p. 1884, lines 16-21.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 7, p. 1895, lines 2-3.\n\n959.\n\nAs far as the Claimant's claim that President Olano unduly intervened in the resolution of the 2006-2007 Royalty Case by ensuring that the 2008 Royalty Case, which was filed nine months after the 2006-2007 Royalty Case, would \"*proceed[] on a fast track*\u201d and would be issued first,1538 the Claimant *inter alia* relies on Mr. Estrada's testimony that it is usual practice for first-filed challenges to be decided first. The Claimant further relies on an email by Mr. Moreano, the presiding *vocal* of Chamber 10 that was hearing the 2006-2007 Royalty Case, who voiced a complaint as to the lack of coordination between chambers after the 2008 Royalty Case resolution was issued.1539\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 391.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 391.\n\n960.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this claim has no merit. The Claimant has not demonstrated to the Tribunal's satisfaction that Ms. Olano acted improperly. Again, Ms. Olano testified that \"*as President, I do not decide on [r]esolutions [reviewed by] the [Tribunal's] Chambers*.\u201d1540 Furthermore, Mr. Sarmiento convincingly testified that before receiving the resolution that Chamber 1 prepared for the 2008 Royalty Case, Chamber 10 had in fact already listened to the parties and had a \"*clear idea*\u201d as to how they were going to decide the case.1541 The Claimant has also not explained how the fact that a later filed case was decided before an earlier filed case would constitute a manifestly unfair or unreasonable procedural shortcoming.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 7, p. 1895, lines 2-3.\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 7, p. 2003, line 20 to p. 2004, line 8.\n\n961.\n\nAs far as the Claimant argues that by adopting a nearly identical resolution to the 2008 Royalty Case in the 2006-2007 Royalty Case, Chamber 10 \"*abdicated [its] duty to independently deliberate in the challenge to the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments*,\u201d1542 the fact that the resolutions in the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases were \"*nearly identical*\u201d is something that SMCV or the Claimant knew as early as 2013, when the decisions were rendered. The Claimant has not shown how the two resolutions being nearly identical constitutes a serious procedural shortcoming that is manifestly unfair and unreasonable, especially in light of the fact that the Claimant had the opportunity, and actually did file an appeal against the two resolutions in the Peruvian courts.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 168.\n\n**ii. The Claimant's allegations with respect to the 2009, 2010-2011 and Q4 2011 Royalty Cases**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n962.\n\nWith respect to the 2009, 2010-2011 and Q4 2011 Royalty Cases, the Claimant claims that the Tax Tribunal reassigned the 2010-2011 Royalty Case to a *vocal ponente* with a clear conflict of interest, denying SMCV's right to an impartial decision-maker.1543 Specifically, the Claimant argues that Mr. Ninacondor, who had previously worked at SUNAT in the same department that confirmed the 2010-2011 Royalty Assessments and represented SUNAT in SMCV's appeal of the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments, should not have been appointed and should have recused himself. According to the Claimant, when SMCV requested that Mr. Ninacondor recuse himself as the *vocal ponente* for the 2010-2011 Royalty Case, President Olano and her staff disregarded the Tax Tribunal's Rules of Procedure to push through a decision that baselessly denied SMCV's request.1544 Specifically, the Claimant submits that Ms. Olano should have convened the Plenary Chamber to deliberate and decide upon the request but, instead, sent the *vocales* a draft in advance of the session, which included \"*how President Olano Silva expected [them] to vote.*\u201d1545\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 396.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 397.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 171.\n\n963.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that the Claimant's claim has no merit. Even under the assumption that Mr. Ninacondor's appointment and failure to recuse himself were improper under the applicable domestic law, the Claimant has failed to show how such impropriety would be constitutive of a violation of the FET standard. Even the Claimant's own expert does not argue that no deliberation took place, but that President Olano's treatment of the recusal request shows that \"*the Plenary Chamber did not carry out a serious deliberative exercise*.\u201d1546 The Claimant has failed to substantiate how the fact that a draft decision was circulated ahead of a deliberation would constitute a serious procedural shortcoming that is manifestly unfair and unreasonable.\n\nHernandez I (**CER-3**), \u00b6 235.\n\n964.\n\nAs far as the Claimant submits that Chamber 1 held a hearing in the 2010-2011 Royalty Case the same day that Chamber 2 held its hearing in the 2009 Royalty Case, despite being filed five years later, and issued its resolution one week after Chamber 2, and both copy-pasted significant parts of the 2008 Royalty Case resolution,1547 the Tribunal finds that the Claimant's claim has likewise no merit. On the facts, the Claimant has failed to substantiate its allegation that the 2010-2011 and 2009 Royalty Cases were not decided independently. The fact that the 2010-2011 and 2009 Royalty Cases resolutions were similar to the 2008 Royalty Case resolution is not in itself evidence that Chambers 1 and 2 failed to consider the case independently. On the law, the Claimant has not substantiated how the fact that the resolutions were similar to the 2008 Royalty Case resolution would constitute a violation of FET.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 398.\n\n965.\n\nFinally, as far as the Claimant submits that after SMCV challenged the Q4 2011 Royalty Case, the case was assigned to Ms. Villanueva, who in the meantime had been promoted to *vocal* for Chamber 9, as *vocal ponente* thereby denying SMCV the opportunity to have its case properly heard and decided by an impartial decision-maker,1548 the Tribunal finds that the Claimant's claim has no merit, either. The Claimant has not brought forward any rule which should have barred Ms. Villanueva from acting as *vocal* for Chamber 9 in the Q4 2011 case. The Claimant's claim remains unsubstantiated.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 399.\n\n966.\n\nAccordingly, none of the Claimant's claims based on due process violations are founded. The Tribunal, thus, finds no violation of Article 10.5 of the TPA under this account.\n\n**2. The Claimant's claim that the Respondent violated Article 10.5 of the TPA each time it arbitrarily and unreasonably failed to waive the assessments of penalties and interest against SMCV**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n967.\n\nThe Claimant claims that the Respondent violated Article 10.5 of the TPA each time it failed to waive the penalties and interest assessments against SMCV for the Royalty and Tax Assessments.1549\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 400 *et seq.*; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 175 *et seq.*; Claimant's Comments on the NDP Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 42 *et seq.*\n\n968.\n\nThese penalty and interest charges were unfair and inequitable, as SMCV's position that it was not required to pay royalties and taxes was reasonable in light of the clear provisions of the Mining Law and Regulations, the Government's previous position regarding the scope of stability guarantees, and the need of mining companies to make continuous investments. The penalties and interest were also disproportionate as their amount significantly exceeded the amount of principal assessed, amounting to 112% of the overall assessments for royalties and new taxes.1550\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 401.\n\n969.\n\nThe Claimant argues that SMCV was entitled to a waiver of penalties and interest because there was, at a minimum, reasonable doubt as to the correct interpretation of the Mining Law and Regulations. The Claimant submits that Peruvian authorities had an obligation under Peruvian law and international principles of fairness and equity to waive the exorbitant penalties and interest on the Royalty and Tax Assessments.1551 Article 170 of the Tax Code recognizes that it is unfair and inequitable to charge penalties and interest when non-payment results from lack of clarity in the relevant rule.1552 SMCV reasonably believed that it did not owe royalty and tax payments based on a reasonable interpretation of the relevant laws and regulations, and should thus not be punished for nonpayment.1553 According to the Claimant, where there is \"*reasonable doubt*,\u201d the Government must (i) clarify the scope of the rule and (ii) waive penalties and interest, and this must be done irrespective of whether a party requests it.1554 The Government cannot arbitrarily refuse to issue a clarification.1555 If the Government could withhold the clarification at will, then it could arbitrarily deny taxpayers their right to a waiver of penalties and interest for reasonable doubt for no or any reason, contrary to the equitable purposes that Article 170 serves.1556 Even if the Government had discretion to decide whether to issue a clarification, the Government should have issued the clarification to waive SMCV's penalties and interest because under the proportionality principle set out in the Law on General Administrative Procedure, the Government does not have absolute discretion but must make decisions proportional to the purpose sought to be achieved by the provision in question.1557\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 175.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 403; Peruvian Tax Code, Supreme Decree No. 133-2013-EF dated 22 June 2013 (**CA-14**), Article 170.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 403 (b).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 403 (c); Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 185 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 185 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 187.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 188; Juan Carlos Mor\u00f3n Urbina, Comments on the Law on General Administrative Procedure (Gaceta Jur\u00eddica, 10th ed. 2014) (**CA-341**), p. 74.\n\n970.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the court decision and opinions in SMCV's favor demonstrate that there was, at the very minimum, \"*reasonable doubt*\u201d as to the proper interpretation of the Mining Law and Regulations.1558 Moreover, SMCV's interpretation was grounded in the plain text of the Mining Law and Regulations, and was consistent with commercial logic and comparative industry practice.1559 In addition, in enacting the 2014 and 2019 amendments to the Mining Law and Regulations, the Government itself took the position that the prior versions of those provisions were ambiguous and imprecise.1560 In addition, SMCV's interpretation was consistent with Government officials' conduct, both generally and toward SMCV.1561\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 405.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 406.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 407; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 183.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 408; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 181-182.\n\n971.\n\nThe Claimant argues that in the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases, the Tax Tribunal and Contentious Administrative Courts arbitrarily refused to consider the merits of SMCV's waiver request on the basis that SMCV had abandoned the issue by not first raising it during the initial challenge proceedings.1562 However, under Peruvian law, a taxpayer cannot waive its right to a penalties and interest waiver by procedural default; rather, courts have a duty to consider the issue *sua sponte* and to grant or order a waiver whenever a taxpayer meets the conditions of Article 170.1563 The Tax Tribunal provided only limited justifications for why SMCV had allegedly waived the argument, and failed to address altogether SMCV's argument that the Tax Tribunal was required to consider the waiver of penalties and interest *sua sponte*.1564 Moreover the Contentious Administrative Courts arbitrarily accepted the Tax Tribunal's erroneous conclusion without any independent analysis.1565 According to the Claimant, like in the *Lion Mexico* case, the Contentious Administrative Courts' repeated refusal to entertain the merits of SMCV's waiver request on dubious procedural grounds \"*amount to an improper and egregious procedural conduct, which does not meet the basic internationally accepted standard of administration of justice and due process*.\u201d1566\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 409.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 410; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 189 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 410; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 189 *et seq.*\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 411.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 412, referring to: *Lion Mexico v.

The Respondent argues that for certain of the Royalty Assessment cases, SMCV failed to timely raise the issue of penalties and interest and, when it belatedly tried to do so on appeal, the Peruvian courts rejected SMCV's attempt to enlarge the scope of the case on appeal. According to the Respondent, there is nothing arbitrary or unreasonable about those decisions. For the Royalty Assessment cases in which SMCV did timely object to the penalties and interest, SUNAT and the Tax Tribunal considered the merits of the Claimant's arguments, and, acting within their discretion, rejected the requests. The Respondent submits that even if the Claimant or the Tribunal disagrees with the merits of any decision, such disagreement is insufficient to find a breach of the FET provision.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 721.\n\n976.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's basis for requesting the waiver of penalties and interest, *i.e.,* \"*reasonable doubt*\u201d under Article 170 of the Tax Code, is flawed. While the Respondent does not disagree that \"*reasonable doubt*\u201d can be a basis for seeking waiver of penalties and interest, it only applies in two specific situations:1576\n\n- First, a taxpayer may seek a waiver of penalties and interest on the basis of \"*reasonable doubt*\u201d when there is an interpretation of a norm that has been changed as a result of a formal ruling that the prior interpretation was incorrect (e.g., SUNAT interpreted a rule one way but then issued a second, different ruling stating that the first interpretation was incorrect). This clarification must \"*expressly provide that it is issued for purposes of Article 170 of the Tax Code*\u201d and must be published in *El Peruano*.1577 In this scenario of \"*reasonable doubt,*\u201d the Tax Tribunal and the courts are required to waive interest and penalties. However, Article 170 does not impose an obligation of clarification.1578\n\n- Second, \"*reasonable doubt*\u201d can apply when SUNAT has inconsistently applied a rule over the course of time (e.g., SUNAT simultaneously applies a rule one way with one taxpayer and another way with another taxpayer, notwithstanding the fact that the taxpayers are similarly situated).1579\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 724.\n\nBravo-Pic\u00f3n I (**RER-3**), \u00b6 73.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 725.\n\nBravo-Pic\u00f3n I (**RER-3**), \u00b6 76.\n\n977.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant has not pointed to either (i) an official clarification published in El Peruano that clarified a provision on which SMCV relied in not paying its obligations or (ii) a series of SUNAT decisions that applied in a contrary manner a tax or royalty provision on which SMCV relied.1580 SMCV's subjective beliefs that there existed a reasonable doubt as to the interpretation of the Mining Law and Regulations are irrelevant. Even if SMCV were permitted under Peruvian law to make a \"*reasonable doubt*\u201d argument in these circumstances, there was in any event no reasonable doubt about whether activities related to the SMCV's Concentrator Plant incurred royalties as the Mining Law and Regulations are clear in establishing that stability guarantees extend only to the investment project defined in the stability agreement and its feasibility study.1581\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 726.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 727.\n\n978.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant cannot accuse the Respondent of acting unfairly, unreasonably, or arbitrarily by not issuing a clarification, when the Respondent is not obligated to issue a clarification and when there exists no ambiguous law or regulation prompting a need for a clarification. In any case, the Respondent's non-issuance of a clarification cannot be said to be an act in opposition to the rule of law, nor one that \"*shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety*\u201d leading to a breach of the FET standard.1582\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1025.\n\n979.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant cannot base its \"*reasonable doubt*\u201d on the fact that one case was decided in SMCV's favor and, in other instances, judges issued dissenting opinions. In any event, such decisions were all rendered after SMCV filed its tax returns for all of the fiscal years at issue.1583 Moreover, contrary to the Claimant's argument, the 2014 and 2019 amendments to the Mining Law and Regulations are not proof that reasonable doubt existed in earlier years.1584 Peruvian officials have consistently held the position that the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement was limited.1585\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 728.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 731.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 733.\n\n980.\n\nWith respect to the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Cases, the Respondent argues that the Tax Tribunal and the Contentious Administrative Courts did not arbitrarily refuse to consider the merits of the SMCV's waiver request. Specifically, while SMCV was obliged to raise its objections regarding the application of penalties and interest with the Tax Tribunal at the time it filed its appeals against SUNAT's Assessment(s) pursuant to Article 147 of the Peruvian Tax Code, it only did so after the Tax Tribunal had issued its decisions upholding SUNAT's Assessments for the 2006-2007 and 2008 Royalty Case. As a result, SMCV waived its right to challenge the portions of those Assessments in which SUNAT had applied penalties and interest for SMCV's failure to pay the royalties otherwise due.1586\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 735.\n\n981.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that the Tax Tribunal had an obligation to consider the issue *sua sponte.* According to the Respondent, this would have only been the case had an official clarification been issued. However, no such clarification existed.1587 Moreover, in response to the Claimant's argument that the first-instance Contentious Administrative Courts arbitrarily accepted the Tax Tribunal's erroneous conclusion, the Respondent submits that it cannot be arbitrary that a court of appeals would not consider an issue that was not properly raised before the court below. The Respondent cannot be faulted for SMCV's own failure to timely raise its claims.1588 In any event, considering the merits of the Article 170 argument would have been futile because SMCV was not entitled to the waiver of penalties and interest.1589\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 736.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 737.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 740.\n\n982.\n\nWith respect to the remaining waiver requests relating to other Royalty and Tax Assessments, the Respondent submits that the Tax Tribunal and SUNAT acted reasonably and consistently with Peruvian law in rejecting SMCV's waiver requests.1590 The Respondent submits that the Claimant's arguments are meritless and stem from the Claimant's fundamental misunderstanding of how \"*reasonable doubt*\u201d operates under Article 170 of the Tax Code.1591 According to the Respondent, the Tax Tribunal properly considered SMCV's arguments, applied the law, and correctly determined that the application of Article 170 was inappropriate.1592\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 1017 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 741.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 744.\n\n983.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that SMCV is responsible for the amount of interest and penalties.1593 Specifically, SMCV did not pay its obligations for years even though if it had succeeded in its challenges to the various Royalty Assessments, SUNAT would have refunded those payments, with interest.1594 SMCV could and should have mitigated penalties and interest by paying its obligations (or, later, its Assessments) and then requesting a refund or challenging the assessments before the applicable administrative and judicial authorities.1595 Moreover, the Respondent submits that there was nothing nefarious about the delay before the Tax Tribunal.1596 In any event, SMCV affirmatively chose to not pay the Royalty Assessments on activities related to the Concentrator Plant despite its knowledge that the government interpreted the 1998 Stability Agreement as only applying to the Leaching Project.1597\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 746 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 746.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1032.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 747.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 748.\n\n984.\n\nIn relation to the allegedly wrong interest rate that was applied to SMCV for its 2009 and 2010-2011 Royalty Assessments, the Respondent submits that the mining royalty is regulated by the Mining Royalty Law and its accompanying regulations.1598 The Mining Law and Regulations apply monthly interest equivalent to the default interest rate to unpaid mining royalties. SUNAT therefore applied the proper interest rate.1599 Moreover, the Tax Tribunal appropriately denied SMCV's request to recalculate the interest rate for its 2009 and 2010-2011 Royalty Assessments because Peruvian law prohibits the Tax Tribunal from considering claims with respect to assessments for which the related collection proceedings have concluded. The requests were filed after the collection proceedings for the underlying Assessments had concluded. Thus, the Tax Tribunal was required to reject SMCV's request in accordance with Peruvian law. Contrary to the Claimant's allegation, the Tax Tribunal did not act unfairly or arbitrarily towards SMCV and the Respondent did not breach its FET obligations.1600\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 749.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 750.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1029.\n\n**c) The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n985.\n\nThe NDP has not provided an express position on the standard of arbitrariness and has, rather, focused its comments on denial of justice (see above, paras. 949 *et seq.*).\n\n**d) The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n986.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that penalties and interest constitute \"*taxation measures*\u201d within the meaning of Article 22.3.1 of the TPA(see above, paras. 540 *et seq.*).

During the Hearing, evidence was taken with regard to Article 170 of the Peruvian Tax Code and the waiver requirements. However, this was done without prejudice to the Tribunal's decision on jurisdiction.1601\n\nHearing Transcript, Day 9, p. 2592, lines 6-9.\n\n**3. The Claimant's claim that the Respondent violated Article 10.5 of the TPA when it arbitrarily and unreasonably refused to reimburse SMCV's GEM overpayments**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a) The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n987.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent violated its obligation to accord FET when it refused to reimburse the GEM payments that SMCV made for the Concentrator during the periods of Q4 2011 to Q3 2012.1602\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 421 *et seq*.; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 202 *et seq.*\n\n988.\n\nThe Claimant submits that SMCV agreed to pay the highest amount of GEM on the understanding that it was not obliged to pay royalties, an understanding that the Government repeatedly encouraged in inducing SMCV's significant GEM payments.1603 In particular, the Claimant contends that during discussions that the Mining Society had with the Government during the design of the GEM process in 2011, SMCV was characterized as a \"*stabilized company*.\u201d1604 The Claimant also argues that the Government did not inform SMCV that it planned to assess additional royalties against SMCV in the lead-up to SMCV's signing of the GEM Agreement, even when Ms. Torreblanca sought clarification on this specific point from the DGM, the MEF, and MINEM.1605 Ms. Torreblanca also testifies that MEF and MINEM officials verbally confirmed to her that they agreed with SMCV's position, and with the proposition that mining companies \"*could not be subject to both*.\u201d1606 At no point did SUNAT, or any other part of the Government, inform SMCV that it should take into account royalty payments for the Concentrator in determining its GEM payments. The Claimant argues that it was only after SMCV negotiated the GEM Agreement and made GEM payments for two years that SUNAT began issuing Royalty Assessments again.1607\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 423.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 423 (a); Santa Mar\u00eda I (**CWS-9**), \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 38, 41, 45.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 423 (a); Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6\u00b6 85-89; SMCV Letter No. SMCV.VL&RG-1896-2011 dated 7 October 2011 (**CE-628**); SMCV, Letter No. SMCV-VL&RG-1968-2011 dated 26 October 2011 (**CE-630**); SMCV, Letter No. SMCV-VL&RG-2217-2011 dated 5 December 2011 (**CE-631**).\n\nTorreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 86.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 423.\n\n989.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's refusal to fully reimburse SMCV for its GEM overpayments was arbitrary and unsupported by Peruvian law.1608 In this regard, the Claimant submits that in early 2012, SMCV agreed to pay GEM for its entire mining unit, including the Concentrator, after the Government confirmed that it would not impose both GEM and royalties and SMT on SMCV.1609 The Government initially stopped issuing any further Royalty Assessments. However, after SMCV made GEM payments in excess of USD 100 million for its entire mining unit, SUNAT notified SMCV (i) on 18 January 2018, of the Q4 2011 Royalty Assessment and the Q4 2011-2012 SMT Assessments, and (ii) on 18 April 2018, of the 2012 Royalty Assessments, despite the fact that mining companies' GEM payments were made instead of royalty and SMT payments.1610 In December 2018, SUNAT granted SMCV's reimbursement request for Q4 2012 to Q4 2013 GEM overpayments and repaid USD 76 million, including interest, recognizing that GEM and royalties were mutually exclusive under Peruvian law.1611 In December 2018, SMCV then also requested under protest the reimbursement of the GEM overpayments for Q4 2011 to Q3 2012, a reimbursement to which it was entitled since Peru had charged GEM plus SMT and royalties plus penalties and interest for the same periods. The Claimant submits that SUNAT arbitrarily refused to reimburse SMCV's GEM overpayments on the ground that SMCV's reimbursement requests were time-barred even though they were not.1612\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 424.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 202; Torreblanca I (**CWS-11**), \u00b6 90; Agreement for the Assessment of *Gravamen Especial a la Miner\u00eda* Approved by Law No. 29790 dated 28 February 2012 (**CE-64**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 202, referring to: SUNAT Assessment No. 012-003-0092685, Q4 2011 Royalty Assessments dated 29 December 2017 (notified on 18 January 2018) (**CE-174**); SUNAT Assessments Nos. 012-003-0092658 and 012-003- 0092961 to 012-003-0092964 (SMT for 4Q 2011-2012) dated 29 December 2017 (notified on 18 January 2018) (**CE-700**); SUNAT Assessment No. 012-003-0094883, 2012 Royalty Assessments dated 28 March 2018 (notified on 18 April 2018) (**CE-176**); Regulations for the Law Establishing GEM Legal Framework, Supreme Decree No. 173-2011-EF dated 29 September 2011 (**CA-182**), Article 2(l); Agreement for the Assessment of *Gravamen Especial a la Miner\u00eda* Approved by Law No. 29790 dated 28 February 2012 (**CE-64**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 203; SUNAT, Resolution No. 012-180-0018113/SUNAT (GEM Q4 2012) dated 18 December 2018 (**CE-746**); SUNAT, Resolution No. 012-180-0018114/SUNAT, (GEM 2013) dated 18 December 2018 (**CE-747**).\n\nSUNAT Resolution No. 012-180-0018640/SUNAT, GEM Q4 2011-Q3 2012 dated 4 March 2019 (**CE-218**); Bullard II (**CER-7**), \u00b6 V.\n\n990.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the five-year statute of limitations set out in the Civil Code, not the Tax Code, applies to GEM overpayments because the GEM is not a tax.1613 It is a contractual obligation that stems from the GEM Agreement that SMCV concluded with the Government.1614 Under Peruvian law, \"*the provisions of the Civil Code apply to legal relationships and situations regulated by other laws*\u201d unless those \"*other laws*\u201d expressly preempt the Civil Code. Here, the GEM Law does not provide a different statute of limitations applicable to SMCV's reimbursement requests based on the contractual nature of GEM. Thus, the statute of limitations set out in Article 1274 of the Civil Code applies, which provides that \"*[t]he statute of limitations to recover what was unduly paid runs out five years after the payment has been made*.\u201d1615\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 207 (a).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 207 (a); Agreement for the Assessment of *Gravamen Especial a la Miner\u00eda* Approved by Law No. 29790 dated 28 February 2012 (**CE-64**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 207 (b); Peruvian Civil Code (**CA-39**), Article 1274.\n\n991.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that under the Civil Code, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the date the party became aware that the payment was unduly imposed, which in SMCV's case, was not until 13 April 2016 at the very earliest, when SUNAT notified SMCV of the 2010-2011 Royalty Assessments. The five-year statute of limitations expired at the very earliest on 13 April 2021, and SMCV's reimbursement requests made on 28 December 2018 fell within the five-year period.1616\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 208; SUNAT, Assessment Resolution Nos. 052-003-0014011 to 052-003-0014015, 052-003-0014020 to 052-003-0014022, 052-003-0014024, 052-003-0014026 to 052-003-0014028 (2010-2011 Royalty Assessments) dated 13 April 2016 (**CE-142A**) (notified to SMCV 13 April 2016); SUNAT, Assessment Resolution Nos. 052-003-0014016 to 052-003-0014019, 052-003-0014023, 052-003-0014025, 052-003-0014029 to 052-003-0014031 (2010-2011 Royalty Assessments) dated 13 April 2016 (**CE-142B**) (notified to SMCV 13 April 2016).\n\n992.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent\u2019s failure to reimburse SMCV\u2019s GEM payments was arbitrary, grossly unfair, non-transparent, and inequitable given that the Government had induced and accepted those very payments assuring SMCV that it did not have to pay both GEM and royalties.1617\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 205.\n\n**b) The Respondent\u2019s position**\n--------------------------------\n\n993.\n\nThe Respondent submits that it did not breach its FET obligations by refusing to refund certain of SMCV\u2019s GEM payments.1618\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 752 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 485 *et seq.*, and 1034 *et seq.*\n\n994.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, its actions were not arbitrary or unsupported by Peruvian law because SUNAT dutifully followed Peruvian law and approved SMCV\u2019s request for a refund that was made within the statute of limitations. SUNAT rejected only an SMCV request that was untimely, because it was filed outside the statute of limitations. Accordingly, the Respondent cannot be held liable for SMCV\u2019s failure to act in a timely manner.1619\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 752.\n\n995.\n\nMoreover, even if the Claimant disagrees with SUNAT\u2019s decision, this does not rise to an FET breach. Applying the standard set out in the *ELSI* judgment, the Respondent argues that there is no basis to find that a decision enforcing a statute of limitations that SMCV was or should have been aware of is *\"opposed to the rule of law,\u201d* is *\"a wilful disregard of due process of law,\u201d* or is *\"an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety* .\u201d1620\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 753, referring to: *ELSI*, Judgment (**RA-72**), \u00b6 128.\n\n996.\n\nSpecifically, the Respondent submits that the Claimant timely submitted its refund requests for its GEM contributions for the period Q4 2012 to Q4 2013 and SUNAT approved those refunds.1621 However, the Claimant did not submit its refund request for GEM contributions for the period Q4 2011 to Q3 2012 until one year later, *i.e.,* on 28 December 2018. SUNAT denied those requests because the statute of limitations had expired. The Respondent contends that pursuant to Articles 43.3 and 44.5 of the Tax Code, a taxpayer has four years to request a refund for overpayment, counting from January 1st of the year after the payment was made. SMCV made the payments related to Q4 2011 to Q3 2012 in 2012. Accordingly, the statute of limitations to request any refunds started to run on 1 January 2013 and expired on 1 January 2017.1622\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 754.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 755. Tax Code (**CA-14**), Articles 43, 44.3.\n\n997.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's arguments are also in all other respects without merit:\n\n- Contrary to the Claimant's argument, the Respondent submits that the Government did not repeatedly encourage SMCV's understanding or induce SMCV's GEM payments. In any event, the Claimant knew SUNAT's position, as SUNAT had been arguing it before the Tax Tribunal and various courts since 2010.1623 Once the Superior Court issued its decision on appeal in January 2016 agreeing with SUNAT's position, SUNAT issued Royalty Assessments shortly thereafter, in April 2016. The Respondent submits that if SMCV had then issued its request for a refund for the Concentrator-related GEM payments, it would have been within the statute of limitations period for all of the GEM payments.1624\n\n- The Respondent submits that while the Peruvian Treasury retained both the GEM payments and the Royalty Assessments, this is because SMCV did not exercise its rights.1625 In any event, the Respondent acted consistently with Peruvian law. According to the Respondent, SUNAT would be acting in an arbitrary manner if it afforded SMCV special treatment and disregarded the law on its behalf, to the detriment of Peruvian taxpayers.1626\n\n- The Respondent argues that it did not misinterpret the statute of limitations. According to the Respondent, the Claimant's rights under discussion here are specific rights under the Tax Code to seek refunds for overpayment of certain taxes (as specifically set out in Articles 43 and 44 of the Tax Code).1627 The Respondent argues that the Claimant's unsupported interpretation according to which the statute of limitations should only start running once the taxpayer subjectively learns of his or her error would undermine the purpose of a statute of limitations, which is to provide certainty and finality.1628\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 757.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 758.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 759.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 760.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 765.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 766.\n\n998.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the Claimant knew as early as 2004, and certainly by 2005/2006, that the Respondent took the position that the Concentrator-related activities were not covered by the 1998 Stability Agreement. Moreover, SUNAT started issuing assessments against SMCV on that basis in 2009, and SUNAT argued that position before the Tax Tribunal and various courts starting in 2010. Despite that, the Claimant chose not to account for the royalty payments it owed for the Concentrator-related activities in determining its GEM payments and not to request refunds for its GEM overpayments until December 2017 and December 2018. The Claimant also did not seek to obtain any interim protection of its refund rights during the pendency of the 2008 Royalty Assessment litigation. When the Claimant made a timely request for certain refunds, the Respondent granted it. However, when, a year later, SMCV made a second, untimely request, the Respondent rejected it. The Respondent argues that there was nothing unfair, unequitable, or arbitrary and nothing close to violative of the TPA about SUNAT's actions.1629\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 767.\n\n**c) The Non-Disputing Party's position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n999.\n\nThe NDP has not provided an express position on the standard of arbitrariness and has, rather, focused its comments on denial of justice (see above, paras. 949 *et seq.*).\n\n**d) The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1000.\n\nThe Tribunal has already set out the applicable legal standard in relation to arbitrariness (see paras. 894 *et seq*.). As set out above, the Parties agree that an action may be arbitrary if it is \"*not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal preference*.\u201d1630 Arbitrariness is also characterized as \"*something opposed to the rule of law*\u201d and requires \"*a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety*.\u201d1631 The Tribunal will thus proceed to assess the Respondent's conduct on the basis of this standard.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 363, referring to: *Crystallex v. Venezuela*, Award (**CA-222**), \u00b6 578; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 648, referring to: *EDF v. Romania*, Award (**RA-62**), \u00b6 303.\n\n*ELSI*, Judgment (**RA-72**), \u00b6 128.\n\n1001.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that nothing in the Respondent's conduct conveys arbitrariness. On the contrary, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent acted in line with the applicable domestic law.\n\n1002.\n\nSpecifically, with respect to the Claimant's argument that the Respondent allegedly induced and accepted the GEM payments assuring SMCV that it did not have to pay both GEM and royalties, the Tribunal finds no convincing evidence that such an inducement took place. On the contrary, aside from the ample evidence indicating that the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement was clear and that royalties were thus due for the Concentrator, SMCV was by all means aware of SUNAT's position regarding SMCV's liability for royalties at the latest when the 2006-2007 Royalty Assessments were imposed on SMCV in August 2009.1632 SMCV entered into the GEM Agreement when it was already aware of the Respondent's position on the scope of the 1998 Stability Agreement, and thus, of its obligation to pay royalties in relation to the Concentrator. The fact that SMCV could challenge SUNAT's 2006-2007 Royalty Assessment or that SMCV or the Claimant's belief that royalties were not due does not change the fact that SUNAT held the position that royalties were due for the Concentrator. In any event, the Respondent cannot be held liable for any errors in judgment committed by SMCV or the Claimant when it entered into the GEM Agreement. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not established that there was any arbitrary conduct on the Respondent's part.\n\nSUNAT, 2006/07 Royalty Assessments dated 17 August 2009 (**CE-31**), Annex No. 1.\n\n1003.\n\nWith regard to the issue of the reimbursement of the overpayments, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed between the Parties that SMCV had the right to have the GEM overpayments reimbursed.1633 Undisputably, only royalties or GEM payments were owed but not both at the same time. This is why SUNAT granted SMCV's reimbursement requests made on 28 December 2017 for the Q4 2012 to Q4 2013 GEM payments. SMCV then waited a full year to request the reimbursement of the Q4 2011 through Q3 2012 GEM payments.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 204; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1034.\n\n1004.\n\nIn the case at hand, SUNAT denied the refund requests made by SMCV on 28 December 2018 for the Q4 2011 through Q3 2012 GEM payments on the basis that the statute of limitations to submit such refund requests had expired.1634 According to the Claimant, the Respondent did not apply the right statute of limitations and the Respondent's decision was, thus, arbitrary.\n\nSUNAT Resolution No. 012-180-0018640/SUNAT dated 4 March 2019 (notified to SMCV on 22 March 2019) (**CE-218**).\n\n1005.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that this argument lacks any merit as there was nothing arbitrary about the Respondent's enforcement of its statute of limitations. At most, it would constitute a misapplication of Peruvian law if the Claimant's position on the applicable limitation period were correct.\n\n1006.\n\nThe Tribunal is, however, not convinced that the Claimant's position on the applicable limitation period was even correct. With respect to the applicable statute of limitations, the Parties agree that GEM is a contractual obligation that stems from the GEM Agreement that SMCV concluded with the Government.1635 The Tribunal further notes that, according to the Claimant, \"*under Peruvian law, 'the provisions of the Civil Code apply to legal relationships and situations regulated by other laws' unless those 'other laws' expressly preempt the Civil Code*.\u201d1636\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 207 (a); Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 511; Agreement for the Assessment of *Gravamen Especial a la Miner\u00eda* Approved by Law No. 29790 dated 28 February 2012 (**CE-64**).\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 207.\n\n1007.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that \"*other laws*\u201d indeed do preempt the application of the statute of limitations under the Civil Code. In particular, the Tribunal notes as follows:\n\n- The Parties agree that the GEM Agreement is the contractual obligation to consider. They, thus, agree on the applicable legal framework for their obligations.\n\n- The third and eighth clauses of the GEM Agreement set out the legal framework applicable to the GEM Agreement, *i.e.,* \"*Law No. 29790 and the Regulations thereof.*\u201d1637\n\n- In turn, Article 5 of Law 29790 makes clear that the provisions of Law 28969, which authorizes SUNAT to enforce rules to facilitate the administration of mining royalties, apply.1638\n\n- Article 3(a)(ii) of Law 28969 *inter alia* specifies that Articles 43 and 44 from the First Book of the Tax Code is applicable.1639\n\n- Article 43.3 of the Tax Code provides that \"*[a]ctions aimed at requesting compensation or making compensation, as well as actions involving request for refunds, expire after four (4) years*.\u201d1640\n\nAgreement for the Assessment of *Gravamen Especial a la Miner\u00eda* Approved by Law No. 29790 dated 28 February 2012 (**CE-64**), Clause 3 and 8.\n\nEstablishing GEM Legal Framework, Law No. 29790 dated 28 September 2011 (**CA-181**), Article 5.\n\nLaw that Authorizes SUNAT to Implement Provisions that Facilitate the Administration of Royalties, Law No. 28969 dated 25 January 2007 (**CA-8**), Article 3(a)(ii).\n\nPeruvian Tax Code, Supreme Decree No. 133-2013-EF dated 22 June 2013 (**CA-14**), Article 43.3.\n\n1008.\n\nAccordingly, by virtue of the GEM Agreement, the applicable statute of limitations is 4 years, as set out in Article 43.3 of the Tax Code, and not the statute of limitations of 5 years provided for in the Civil Code.\n\n1009.\n\nWith respect to the starting point of this statute of limitations, in accordance with Article 44.5 of the Tax Code, the statute of limitations starts to run on 1 January \"*following the date on which the payment that was undue or excessive was made or became such*.\u201d1641\n\nPeruvian Tax Code, Supreme Decree No. 133-2013-EF dated 22 June 2013 (**CA-14**), Article 44.5.\n\n1010.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that SMCV made the Q4 2011 to Q3 2012 GEM payments in 2012. In principle, the date on which the limitations period started to run was, thus, 1 January 2013 (and expired on 1 January 2017). The Tribunal notes that the Claimant's expert Mr. Bullard opines that \"*SMCV could have only become aware that such payments were undue after SUNAT resumed issuing royalty assessments for the same periods for which SMCV made the GEM payments*.\u201d1642 However, the Tribunal finds that SMCV knew that SUNAT considered SMCV to owe royalties as early as 2009, when the first royalty assessments were issued against SMCV. Accordingly, when SMCV made its GEM payments in 2012, it already knew that these payments were not due, should SUNAT continue to assesss royalties for the Concentrator as it had done in preceding time periods.\n\nBullard II (**CER-7**), \u00b6 92.\n\n1011.\n\nThe limitation period, thus, began to run on 1 January 2013 and expired on 1 January 2017. SMCV's reimbursement claims for the Q4 2011 to Q3 2012 GEM payments were made on 28 December 2018 and were thus, time-barred. Accordingly, SUNAT's denial of SMCV's reimbursement claims for Q4 2011 to Q3 2012 GEM does not amount to arbitrariness in the application of the law.\n\n1012.\n\nThe Claimant has, thus, not shown to the Tribunal's satisfaction that the Respondent breached its FET obligations under the TPA.\n\n**VI. QUANTUM**\n---------------\n\n**A. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n1013.\n\nThe Claimant requests compensation due to the Respondent's breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement and Article 10.5 of the TPA, submitting two alternative damage claims:1643\n\n- First, the Claimant claims that SMCV has suffered damages in the amount of at least USD 942.4 million as a result of the Respondent's breaches of the 1998 Stability Agreement and the TPA.1644 The main claim is based on the premise that the 1998 Stability Agreement covers the entire mining unit.\n\n- In the alternative, the Claimant puts forward a different claim, which rests on the premise that the 1998 Stability Agreement did not cover the entire mining unit. In that case, the Claimant calculates that SMCV has suffered at least USD 719.9 million in damages.1645\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 430 *et seq.*; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 287 *et seq*.; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 128 *et seq.*; Spiller-Chavich I (**CER-1**); Spiller-Chavich II (**CER-6**).\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 436 *et seq*.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 289.\n\n1014.\n\nAfter the Hearing, the Claimant introduced Exhibit CE-1143, which the Claimant submits reflects SMCV's payment of approximately USD 26 million in outstanding liabilities.1646 The Claimant stated that, if so requested by the Tribunal, it would submit an updated damages model from its experts in light of this evidence.1647\n\nClaimant's letter to the Tribunal dated 18 October 2023; Claimant's letter to the Tribunal dated 21 November 2023.\n\nClaimant's letter to the Tribunal dated 18 October 2023.\n\n1015.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the Respondent's argument according to which there is a potential for duplication of the damages in this case and in the *SMM Cerro Verde* Arbitration is premature because the tribunal in the *SMM Cerro Verde* Arbitration has not yet rendered an award.1648\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 318.\n\n**B. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n1016.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant's damages claim is flawed and, in any event, inflated.1649\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 769 *et seq.*; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 1042 *et seq.*; Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6\u00b6 303 *et seq.*; Kunsmann I (**RER-5**); Kunsmann II (**RER-10**).\n\n1017.\n\nThe Respondent notes that the Claimant has calculated its damages assuming either that all of the Assessments, including penalties and interest (for its main claim) are deemed to violate the 1998 Stability Agreement and/or the TPA, or that, in its alternative claim, all of the penalties and interest and unrefunded GEM payments violate the TPA. However, the Tribunal would have to carefully consider separately the merits of each of the Claimant's claims of breach, which rest on different facts and legal theories for different challenged SUNAT Assessments. If the Tribunal were to find that the Respondent breached the 1998 Stability Agreement and/or the TPA only with respect to certain Assessments or certain portions of certain Assessments, then the Claimant's damages would have to be limited to the amounts specifically linked to any such breaching Assessments.1650\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 775; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1047.\n\n1018.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that the Claimant's damages are, in part, duplicative of those requested in the *SMM Cerro Verde* Arbitration. The Respondent notes that SMM Cerro Verde's request for 21% of SMCV's lost cash flows overlaps with the Claimant's claim for 100% of damages allegedly suffered by SMCV.1651\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1049.\n\n1019.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent *inter alia* (i) objects to the inclusion of unpaid obligations in the Claimant's damages calculation, (ii) objects to SMCV's dividend distribution assumptions, (iii) objects to the application of cost of equity as the Claimant's pre-award interest rate and discount rate, (iv) argues that SMCV failed to mitigate its damages when it failed to pay its obligations and chose instead to accumulate penalties and interest, (v) objects to the Claimant's inclusion in its damages calculation of penalties and interest relating to tax assessments, which are excluded under the TPA, and (vi) makes corrections to SMCV's short term interest and short-term deposit interest. Combining these corrections for the Treaty claim, the Claimant's damages for its main claim are reduced from USD 942.4 million to USD 119 million and its damages for its alternative claim are reduced from USD 719.9 million to USD 69.3 million.1652 Combining these corrections for the 1998 Stability Agreement claim, the Claimant's damages for its main claim are reduced from USD 942.4 million to USD 288.1 million and its damages for its alternative claim are reduced from USD 719.9 million to USD 163.5 million.1653\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 774 *et seq*.; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 1103-1107; Kunsman II (**RER-10**), \u00b6\u00b6 108 *et seq.*\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 1106.\n\n**C. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1020.\n\nHaving rejected the Claimant's claims in their entirety, the Tribunal equally rejects the Claimant's claim for compensation and interest.1654\n\nThereby, the Tribunal also rejects the Claimant's request for declaratory relief and indemnification at \u00b6 464(G) of the Claimant's Memorial and \u00b6 319(H) of the Claimant's Reply, and as further specified in \u00b6 446 of the Claimant's Memorial.\n\n**VII. COSTS**\n--------------\n\n**A. The Claimant\u2019s position**\n------------------------------\n\n1021.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal order the Respondent to pay all the costs of the arbitration, as well as the Claimant\u2019s and SMCV\u2019s attorneys' fees and expenses.1655 According to the Claimant, the principle of full reparation requires that the Claimant be compensated for the costs of the arbitration proceedings and its legal expenses.1656 The Claimant submits that Article 10.26.1 of the TPA authorizes the Tribunal to award such costs and expenses and that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention grants the Tribunal discretion to assess costs.1657 Relying on *Tenaris & Talta v. Venezuela,* the Claimant submits that tribunals have increasingly exercised their discretion to award the prevailing party its portion of the costs of the arbitration and the reasonable costs it incurs.1658\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 464; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 319; Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, \u00b6 133.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 463.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 463.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 463, referring to: *Tenaris S.A. & Talta \u2013Trading y Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal LDA v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/23, Award dated 12 December 2016 (**CA-225**), \u00b6 845.\n\n1022.\n\nIn its Statement of Costs, the Claimant explains that it incurred USD 31,118,789.48 in (i) attorney\u2019s fees and administrative costs; (ii) witness fees and expenses; and (iii) expert fees and expenses. Of this amount, the Claimant estimates that 15.8% of its costs, *i.e.,* USD 4,917,740.55, relate to the Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections.1659 The Claimant explains that the allocation of costs to jurisdiction is approximative due to the fact that the proceedings were not bifurcated, and that the allocation was made based on, among others, counsel\u2019s task-based tracking system, manual review of certain time entries, and the relative proportion of pages or paragraph numbers in submissions.1660\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs, p. 1.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs, p. 1.\n\n1023.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant explains that it paid USD 1,025,000.00 in ICSID advance payments.\n\n1024.\n\nThe Claimant states that it incurred costs in professional services related to this arbitration, including preparation of written submissions, document review and production, preparation for and participation in the hearing, procedural matters, fact development, communications, and other advice.1661 All the figures in the Claimant's Statement of Costs are as of 31 January 2024 and all figures incurred in currencies other than USD have been converted to USD at the official exchange rate on the date of payment.1662\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs, p. 1.\n\nClaimant's Statement of Costs, fn. 1.\n\n1025.\n\nIn total, the Claimant submits that it incurred **USD 32,143,789.48** as follows:1663\n\n**1.

The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n1030.\n\nThe Tribunal turns to its decisions on costs and begins by setting out the applicable legal framework.\n\n1031.\n\nArticle 10.26.1 of the TPA provides in relevant part:\n\n*A tribunal may also award costs and attorney's fees in accordance with this Section and the applicable arbitration rules*.1674\n\nTPA (**CA-10**), Article 10.26.1.\n\n1032.\n\nPursuant to Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal enjoys broad discretion to allocate costs. This provision sets out:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses* incurred *by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.*\n\n1033.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 28 provides:\n\n*(1) Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:*\n\n*(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre;*\n\n*(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties.*\n\n*(2) Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding. The Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, request the parties and the Secretary-General to provide additional information concerning the cost of the proceeding.*\n\n1034.\n\nFurthermore, ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1) provides in relevant part:\n\n*(1) The award shall be in writing and shall contain:*\n\n*[\u2026]*\n\n*(j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding.*\n\n1035.\n\nFinally, Section 23.2 of Procedural Order No. 1 provides:\n\n*In accordance with Arbitration Rule 28(2), promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each Party shall simultaneously submit to the Secretary of the Tribunal a factual statement of its costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding. The scope and format of the statements of costs will be determined by the Tribunal at the conclusion of the hearing, upon consultation with the Parties.*\n\n1036.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 1 and as established during the Hearing,1675 the Parties have each submitted a factual statement of their incurred costs in the form of an affidavit. Whereas both Parties seek to recover the entirety of the costs relating to the arbitration and the Claimant submits that tribunals have increasingly exercised their discretion to award the prevailing party its portion of the costs of the arbitration and the reasonable costs incurred,1676 the Respondent has not set out its position on the applicable legal principles on cost allocation.\n\nProcedural Order No. 1, Section 23.2; Hearing Transcript, Day 9, p. 2563, lines 3-18; Hearing Transcript, Day 10, p. 3050, line 18 to p. 3051, line 7; p. 3054, lines 10-20; p. 3059, lines 12-15; p. 3060, line 8 to p. 3061, line 14.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 463, referring to: *Tenaris S.A. & Talta \u2013Trading y Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal LDA v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/23, Award dated 12 December 2016 (**CA-225**), \u00b6 845.\n\n1037.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the applicable legal framework does not set out how costs should be apportioned. Rather, the Tribunal has discretion in the apportionment of costs between the Parties.\n\n1038.\n\nThe practice of past investment tribunals on the apportionment of costs is not uniform.1677 Investment tribunals constituted under the ICSID Convention have frequently assessed costs based on two general approaches.1678 The first approach consists in the equal sharing of costs under which each party should bear its own costs and half of the costs of the arbitration.1679 The second approach is the \"*costs follow the event*\u201d approach under which the unsuccessful party bears all the costs of the proceeding or under which costs are apportioned in accordance with the relative success and failure of the parties.1680\n\nAs noted by the following tribunals: *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp. and LG&E International Inc. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Award dated 25 July 2007 (**CA-139**), \u00b6 112; *Continental Casualty Co. v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award dated 5 September 2008 (**CA-150**), \u00b6 318; *Stadtwerke M\u00fcnchen GmbH, RWE Innogy GmbH, and others v.

Peru*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/28, Award dated 18 August 2008 (**CA-149**), \u00b6\u00b6 499-500.\n\nSee for example *Tenaris S.A. & Talta \u2013Trading y Marketing Sociedade Unipessoal LDA v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/23, Award dated 12 December 2016 (**CA-225**), \u00b6 845.\n\n1039.\n\nIn the case at hand, the Tribunal finds that the principle of equal sharing of the costs, according to which each party bears its own costs and half of the costs of the arbitration, should apply for three main reasons.\n\n1040.\n\nFirst, the dispute raised multiple complex questions of fact and law on both jurisdiction and merits. It not only required the assessment of extensive submissions and evidence presented by the Parties, but also involved written and oral submissions by the United States as a Non-Disputing Party on issues of Treaty interpretation. The Tribunal would find it difficult to assess the Parties' relative success under a costs follow the event approach in light of these multiple complex questions of fact and law on both jurisdiction and merits and the involvement of a Non-Disputing Party.\n\n1041.\n\nSecond, the Claimant and the Respondent have been partly successful and partly unsuccessful in their arguments before the Tribunal. The Respondent raised a number of objections to jurisdiction on which the Claimant prevailed in most part. Conversely, the Claimant raised a number of claims both under the Stability Agreement and the TPA on which the Respondent prevailed. Neither of the Parties' respective arguments were frivolous or manifestly unfounded. Rather, the Tribunal has considered that both Parties advanced serious cases and addressed the complex issues posed by the case in a professional and efficient manner. In the Tribunal's view, this mandates for an equal sharing of the costs.\n\n1042.\n\nThird, noting that the Claimant incurred significantly higher costs than the Respondent, the Tribunal finds that the equal sharing of costs constitutes a balanced and predictable approach. Each Party bears the costs it deemed reasonable and appropriate for the presentation of its case.\n\n1043.\n\nNone of the Parties has brought forward circumstances mandating for a departure from the principle of equal sharing of costs.\n\n1044.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal finds it appropriate to consider that each Party shall bear its own costs and half of the costs of the arbitration.\n\n1045.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the Tribunal's Assistant and ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses amount to a total of USD 1,738,182.07 broken down as follows:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitrators' fees and expenses |  |\n| Dr. Inka Hanefeld | 272,420.75 |\n| Prof. Dr. Guido Tawil | 366,924.01 |\n| Prof. Dr. Bernardo Cremades | 409,252.49 |\n| Assistant's fees and expenses |  |\n| Charlotte Matthews | 151,699.43 |\n| ICSID's administrative fees | 220,000.00 |\n| Direct expenses | 317,885.39 |\n| **Total** | **1,738,182.07** |\n\n1046.\n\nThese costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties.1681\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement. The balance in the case account will be refunded to the Parties proportionally to their contributions.\n\n**VIII. DISPOSITIF**\n--------------------\n\n1047.\n\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\na. **The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims except for the Claimant's claims based on the disputed Tax Assessments' penalties and interest;**\n\nb. **The Claimant's claims are rejected in their entirety;**\n\nc. **Each Party shall bear its own costs and half of the arbitration costs;**\n\nd. **All other claims and pleas for relief are rejected.**\n\n**Annex A to Respondent's Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on
