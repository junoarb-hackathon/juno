INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\u201cICSID\u201d** or the **\u201cCentre\u201d)** on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Korea on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 1 December 2007 (the **\u201cBIT\u201d** or **\u201cTreaty\u201d)** and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the **\u201cICSID Convention\u201d).**\n\n2.\n\nThe claimant is Mr. [REDACTED] Min **(\u201cMr. Min\u201d** or the **\u201cClaimant\u201d),** a national of the People\u2019s Republic of China. The respondent is the Republic of Korea **(\u201cKorea\u201d** or the **\u201cRespondent\u201d).** The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the **\u201cParties.\u201d** The Parties\u2019 representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n3.\n\nThis dispute relates to Mr. Min\u2019s claim that his rights under the Treaty and international law, including his rights under BIT Article 2(2) to fair and equitable treatment, have been violated and that he has been denied justice; and that, contrary to BIT Article 4(1), his investment in Korea, namely his shareholding in a Korean company, has been expropriated.\n\n4.\n\nThis Decision sets out the Tribunal\u2019s reasoned decision on the \u201cRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules\u201d (the **\u201cRule 41(5) Objection\u201d** or **\u201cApplication\u201d).**\n\n**II. THE OBJECTION**\n---------------------\n\n5.\n\nICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5) provides as follows.\n\n*Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.*\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Objection is that certain claims raised by Mr. Min are time-barred pursuant to Article 9(7) of the Treaty and that, accordingly, these claims manifestly lack legal merit and should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 41(5) quoted above.\n\n7.\n\nAs appears below, it is not in dispute between the Parties that the Respondent filed its Rule 41(5) Objection within 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal and before its first session.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 16 July 2020, the Claimant submitted its Request for Arbitration, together with Exhibits C-001 to C-024 and Legal Authority CL-001 (the **\u201cRequest\u201d),** which was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID on 3 August 2020, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n9.\n\nOn 20 October 2020, Mr. Stephen L. Drymer, a national of Canada, accepted his appointment by Claimant as arbitrator. On 19 November 2020, Professor Donald M. McRae, a national of Canada and New Zealand, accepted his appointment by Respondent as arbitrator. On 29 January 2021, in accordance with the method of appointment of the President agreed upon by the Parties, Mr. Ian Glick QC, a national of the United Kingdom, accepted his appointment as President of the Tribunal.

THE TREATY**\n------------------\n\n15.\n\nAs already mentioned, Mr. Min alleges that Korea has breached Articles 2(2) and 4(1) of the Treaty; and Korea alleges that certain of his claims are time-barred by Article 9(7).\n\n16.\n\nArticle 2(2) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall accord to investments in its territory of investors of the other Contracting Party fair and equitable treatment and full and constant protection and security.*\n\n17.\n\nArticle 4(1) of the Treaty provides as follows:\n\n*Neither Contracting Party shall expropriate, nationalize or take other similar measures, directly or indirectly, (hereinafter referred to as \u201cexpropriation\u201d) against the investments of the investors of the other Contracting Party in its territory, unless the following conditions are met:*\n\n*(a) for the public interests;*\n\n*(b) in accordance with domestic law and international standard of due process of law;*\n\n*(c) without discrimination;*\n\n*(d) against compensation in accordance with paragraph 2.*\n\n18.\n\nArticle 9 of the Treaty provides, so far as material, as follows.\n\n*1. For the purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party that has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of an alleged breach of this Agreement with respect to an investment of an investor of that other Contracting Party.*\n\n*...*\n\n*3. In case of international arbitration, the dispute shall be submitted, at the option of the investor, to:*\n\n*(a) International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) under the Convention on the Settlement of Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, done at Washington on March 18, 1965;*\n\n*...*\n\n[e]*ach Contracting Party hereby gives its consent for submission by the investor concerned of the investment dispute for settlement by binding international arbitration.*\n\n*...*\n\n*7. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this Article, an investor may not make a claim pursuant to paragraph 3 of this Article if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge that the investor had incurred loss or damage.*\n\n**V. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n-------------------------\n\n19.\n\nFor purposes of the Rule 41(5) Objection, the Tribunal summarises the factual background of the dispute alleged in the Claimant\u2019s Request. This summary does not reflect any finding of fact by the Tribunal.\n\n(a) In 2007, Mr. Min established a company incorporated in Korea called Pi Investment Co. Ltd **(\u201cPi Korea\u201d).** Mr. Min was originally its sole shareholder and, although there was a period when there were other investors, from 2010 until January 2015 Mr. Min was again its sole shareholder.1\n\n(b) In 2008, Pi Korea became the ultimate owner of a valuable building in central Beijing.2\n\n(c) To finance this acquisition, Pi Korea borrowed KRW380 billion in two loans, one from Korea Life Insurance Co., Ltd and one from Kookmin Bank.3 These loans were later, in 2009 and 2010, assigned to Woori Bank, which was then, and at all material times remained, a Korean state-owned and controlled institution.4\n\n(d) In 2010, a criminal investigation into Mr. Min began in Korea which culminated, in December of that year, in the Prosecutor\u2019s Office charging him with embezzlement, bribery, making false accusations against Woori Bank, and breach of fiduciary duty.5\n\n(e) In June 2011, the loans were extended on terms that allowed Woori Bank to accelerate them *\u201cat its own discretion without notice\u201d.* The Woori Bank then took steps to enforce its security, including removing Mr. Min as a director of Pi Korea and establishing a trust over the shares of that company (the \u201c**Pi Korea Shares**\u201d).6\n\n(f) In July 2013, Mr. Min began proceedings in the Seoul Central District Court against Woori Bank seeking a declaration that he was the shareholder of Pi Korea.7\n\n(g) In December 2013, Woori Bank entered into a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the \u201c**Woori-Manner SPA**\u201d)to sell all the Pi Korea Shares, and the loans, to Manner International Trading Ltd (\u201c**Manner**\u201d),a BVI-incorporated company, (the **\u201cManner Transfer\u201d),** and the shares were transferred to Manner in two tranches in March 2014 and January 2015.8 This transfer caused Mr. Min to lose his entire equity interest in Pi Korea.9\n\n(h) In March 2015, Mr. Min learned of the Woori-Manner SPA and the Manner Transfer, and disclosure of the former\u2019s full terms then became an issue in the proceedings, as did its validity and the value of the Pi Korea Shares.10\n\n(i) On 19 November 2015, the Seoul Central District Court found for Woori Bank, holding that the Woori-Manner SPA was valid, and refusing to reinstate him as the sole shareholder of Pi Korea.11\n\n(j) On 10 October 2016, the Seoul High Court convicted Mr. Min of embezzlement and other offences and sentenced him to a 6-year prison term.12\n\n(k) On 23 December 2016, the Seoul High Court upheld the judgment of the Seoul Central District Court.13\n\n(l) On 22 March 2017, the Korean Supreme Court dismissed Mr. Min\u2019s appeal against his conviction, and Mr. Min remains in prison to date.14\n\n(m) On 18 July 2017, the Korean Supreme Court also upheld the judgment of the Seoul Central District Court.15\n\nRequest, paras. 2, 16 and 17.\n\nRequest, paras. 2, 18 and 21.\n\nRequest, paras. 2 and 19.\n\nRequest, paras. 2 and 19.\n\nRequest, para. 50.\n\nRequest, paras. 24-28.\n\nRequest, paras. 5 and 31.\n\nRequest, paras. 4 and 28.\n\nRequest, paras. 4 and 17.\n\nRequest, paras. 29 and 32-44.\n\nRequest, paras. 44-45.\n\nRequest, para. 51.\n\nRequest, para. 46.\n\nRequest, para. 51.\n\nRequest, para. 46.\n\n20.\n\nParagraph 6 of the Request defines the proceedings before the District Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court collectively as the **\u201cKorean Civil Proceedings\u201d.** These, the Claimant alleges, \u201cwere *fraught with procedural flaws and irregularities\"* which *\u201cseriously undermined Mr Min\u2019s right to a fair trial.*\"16\n\nRequest, paras. 6 and 47.\n\n21.\n\nParagraph 7 of the Request alleges as follows.\n\n*The Korean courts' mishandling of the Korean Civil Proceedings was part of a wider scheme against Mr Min, facilitated by the Korean Government and designed to deprive him of his investment*\n\n*in Korea through unlawful criminal investigation and enforcement measures, as well as illegitimate civil judgments. In addition to Woori Bank\u2019s wrongful enforcement of the Pi Korea Security and the Korean Civil Proceedings, the Korean government also subjected Mr Min to inappropriate criminal investigation, discriminatory treatment and unjust criminal proceedings, all of which deprived Mr Min of his right to due process and freedom of movement, including his wrongful conviction and incarceration to date (collectively the* ***\u201cKorean Criminal Proceedings****\").**In**so doing, the Korean government deprived Mr Min of the opportunity to manage his businesses, including the Pi group of companies.*\n\n22.\n\nIn its Application, the Respondent uses the definition **\u201cWoori Bank Enforcement\u201d.** This is not a defined term in the Request but the Tribunal understands it to refer to the Woori Bank\u2019s enforcement of the security over the Pi Korean Shares, and its execution of the Manner Transfer.17\n\nSee the Respondent\u2019s Objection, para. 5(a), and the Request, paras. 65, 66 and 72.\n\n**VI. THE CLAIM**\n-----------------\n\n23.\n\nAt Part V of the Request, the Claimant sets out what he alleges to have been the Respondent\u2019s violations of the Treaty. In particular, the Claimant alleges the following.\n\n**A. Korea Failed to Treat Mr Min\u2019s Investment Fairly and Equitably**\n\n*61. Article 2(2) of the Treaty requires that Korea accord \u201cfair and equitable treatment\u201d to Mr Min\u2019s investment.*\n\n*62. Korea breached its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment to Mr Min\u2019s investment, including the obligation not to deny justice to Mr Min, through the following measures (separately and/or taken together as a composite act), which are discriminatory, unjust, unfair and lacking due process:*\n\n*\u2022 The Korean courts\u2019 improper handling of the Korean Civil Proceedings, including but not limited to:*\n\n*- The Korean courts\u2019 grossly unfair and unjust decision not to order disclosure of the Woori-Manner SPA, a crucial piece of evidence in the Korean Civil Proceedings which denied Mr Min access to key documents necessary to present his case;*\n\n*- The Seoul Central District Court\u2019s failure to forward Mr Min\u2019s appeal on the Disclosure Issue in a timely manner, which deprived Mr Min of his opportunity to appeal on the disclosure issue and to deploy the Woori-Manner SPA in fulfilling his burden of proof at trial;*\n\n*- The Korean courts\u2019 wrongful acceptance that the November 2014 Amendment to the Woori-Manner SPA provided by Woori Bank was valid despite legitimate concerns as to its authenticity, jeopardizing Mr Min's right to due process and a fair trial;*\n\n*- The Korean courts\u2019 wrongful acceptance of the Pi Korea Shares\u2019 zero valuation submitted by Woori Bank at face value, despite the fact that the valuation clearly represented a gross undervalue of the Pi Korea Shares. Further the Korean courts' decision to reject Mr Min\u2019s request for further information from KPMG was unjust and unreasonable; and*\n\n*- The Korean courts\u2019 wrongful acceptance of the validity of the Manner Transfer and/or the Woori-Manner SPA, despite all of the above irregularities.*\n\n*\u2022 The Korean courts and other State organs' improper handling of the Korean Criminal Proceedings, including but not limited to:*\n\n*- The Prosecutor\u2019s Office's discriminatory prosecution of Mr Min;*\n\n*- Mr Min\u2019s wrongful conviction and incarceration;*\n\n*- The Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019s use of unlawful surveillance against Mr Min; and*\n\n*- The Ministry of Justice\u2019s rejection of the Korean court's request that Mr Min be permitted to leave Korea, despite Mr Min\u2019s good track record of cooperating with the Korean authorities and his genuine need to travel for business.*\n\n*63. Each of the acts set out above individually and collectively constitute a violation by Korea of Article 2(2) of the Treaty.*\n\n**B. Korea Expropriated Mr Min\u2019s Investment**\n\n*64. Article 4(1) of the Treaty prohibits Korea from directly or indirectly expropriating or taking any similar measures against qualifying investments unless all of the conditions set out in Article 4(2) are satisfied, i.e., the expropriation is (i) for the public interest; (ii) in accordance with domestic and international standards of due process; (iii) without discrimination; and (iv) with compensation.*\n\n*65. Korea unlawfully expropriated Mr Min's investment in violation of Article 4(1) as its following acts (separately and/or taken together as a composite act) (i) had the effect of expropriating Mr Min\u2019s entire investment in Korea; and (ii) were not carried out for the public interests, in accordance with international standards of due process and/or with compensation:*\n\n*\u2022 Woori Bank\u2019s wrongful enforcement of the Pi Korea Security and execution of the Manner Transfer; and*\n\n*\u2022 The Korean courts\u2019 unlawful handling of the Korean Civil Proceedings.*\n\n24.\n\nAt Part VII of the Request, the Claimant sets out his request for relief as follows:\n\n*(a) A declaration that the Korean Civil Proceedings and the Korean Criminal Proceedings violated Mr Min's rights the Treaty and international law, including Mr Min's right to fair and equitable treatment and also amounted to a denial of justice;*\n\n*(b) A declaration that Korea expropriated Mr Min\u2019s investment in Korea through Woori Bank\u2019s wrongful enforcement of the Pi Korea Security and the Korean Civil Proceedings;*\n\n*(c) An award of damages amounting to Mr Min\u2019s financial loss as a result of the deprivation of his shareholdings in Pi Korea to be quantified at a later stage;*\n\n*(d) A declaration that Mr Min\u2019s indictment, conviction and incarceration as a result of the Korean Criminal Proceedings violated the Treaty and international law;*\n\n*(e) An order that Mr Min be released from prison immediately;*\n\n*(f) An award of moral damages to be quantified at a later stage; and*\n\n*(g) Such other relief as may be just and equitable.*\n\n**VII. THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n-------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the Parties\u2019 written and oral submissions on the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) Objection, and this section provides an overview of the Parties\u2019 positions in summary form. It is not intended to be exhaustive.\n\n26.\n\nIn brief, the Respondent submits that Mr. Min\u2019s claims based on the Woori Bank Enforcement and the Korean Criminal Proceedings are *\u201cmanifestly without legal merit\"* as they are time-barred under BIT Article 9(7). The Claimant disputes his claims are time-barred, and he further argues that Rule 41(5) is an improper remedy in the present case.\n\n**A.** **The Rule** **41(5)** **Standard**\n------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nRule 41(5) of the Arbitration Rules has been set out above.\n\n28.\n\nThe Parties are agreed on the following principles related to the applicable standard for Rule 41(5):\n\n(a) Korea\u2019s Rule 41(5) Objection was timely.\n\n(b) The applicable test is *\u201cmanifestly without legal merit\",* and, in accordance with the decision in ***Trans-Global,***18 a respondent is required *\u201cto establish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch.\"* The Respondent does not dispute that the *Trans-Global* test is a high bar.19\n\n(c) Rule 41(5) relates to *\u201ca legal impediment to a claim\",* not a factual one, so the Tribunal should generally accept the facts as pleaded by the claimant in determining a Rule 41(5) objection, unless it considers that the factual allegations are *\u201cincredible, frivolous, vexatious or inaccurate or made in had faith.*\"20\n\nRL-05, *Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25, para. 88 (Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 12 May 2008 (\u201c***Trans-Global***\").\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 27.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Observations, para. 15.\n\n29.\n\nAs further described below, with respect to the applicable standard, the Parties, however, disagree on: (i) the role of a Rule 41(5) objection in the context of a time-bar objection; and (ii) whether a tribunal should consider *\u201cefficiency\"* in making its determination of a Rule 41(5) Objection.\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s position**\n---------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that Rule 41(5) concerns *\u201ca legal impediment to a claim\", \u201cwhich can go to jurisdiction or the merits of the dispute.*\"21 Furthermore, a time-bar jurisdictional objection \u201c*is squarely \u2018a legal impediment to a claim'\"*, and, in fact, the ***Ansung*** tribunal upheld a Rule 41(5) objection based on the same BIT\u2019s time-bar provision.22\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, para. 13 (citing RL-012, *Almasryia for Operating & Maintaining Touristic Construction Co. LLC v*. *State of Kuwait,* ICSID Case No. ARB/18/2, para. 31 (Award on the Respondent\u2019s Application under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 1 November 2019) (\u201c***Almasryia***\u201d)).\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, para. 14 (citing RL-011, *Ansung Housing Co., Ltd. v. People's Republic of China,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/25 (Award, 9 March 2017) (\"***Ansung***\")).\n\n31.\n\nIn response to the Claimant\u2019s arguments that Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) objection improperly requires the Tribunal to decide a number of critical and complex factual issues, the Respondent emphasises that, for purposes of this Rule 41(5) Objection, the Tribunal need only decide the legal question of interpreting and applying BIT Article 9(7) based on the Claimant\u2019s \"*presumed''* pleaded facts.23 The Respondent is not asking the Tribunal to make any factual inquiry at this stage.24\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, paras. 30, 35 (citing RL-05, *Trans-Global* and RL-014, *Emmis International Holding, B. V. and others v. Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/12/2 (Decision on Respondent\u2019s Objection under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), 11 March 2013 **(\"*****Emmis***\")), 63(b).\n\nHearing Tr., p. 25.\n\n32.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent says, at paragraph 36 of its Observations:\n\n*Hence, the Claimant's assertion that 'the Tribunal must examine whether and to what extent the Respondent's acts complained of by Mr Min that comprise the Woori Bank Enforcement, the Korean Civil Proceedings and the Korean Criminal Proceedings were interconnected or had the common aim of depriving the Claimant of his investment in Korea\u2019 is plainly incorrect. The Tribunal does not need to do so. It only needs to interpret Article 9(7) and apply it to the pleaded facts i.e. assuming, for the purpose of this Rule 41(5) Objection, that there was such a connection between the actions. This is a question of law, not fact.*\n\n33.\n\nContrary to the Claimant\u2019s assertion that *ratione temporis* objections generally require a fact-intensive analysis at the merits stage, the Respondent points out that whether a time-bar objection can be decided at a preliminary stage depends on the case. Moreover, the Claimant\u2019s cited cases concerned different treaty provisions with different formulated claims and objections, which diverge from those in the present case.25 Furthermore, the Respondent highlights that the ***Ansung*** tribunal determined a Rule 41(5) objection based on the same Treaty provision *\u201ceven in the face of the claimant\u2019s* [Ansung\u2019s] *'continuing breach\u2019 argument (which closely mirrored the Claimant\u2019s* [Mr. Min\u2019s] *continuing breach argument in these proceedings).*\u201d26\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 37 (citing *e.g.* Claimant\u2019s First Observations, para. 29).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 38.\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent similarly dismisses the Claimant\u2019s efficiency argument as being irrelevant to the determination of a Rule 41(5) objection and notes that tribunals have granted Rule 41(5) objections that resulted in only partial dismissal of claims, without addressing efficiency.27 In any event, the Respondent points out that by definition there would be efficiency gains if some claims are dismissed.28\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, paras. 41-43 (citing, *e g.* RL-014, *Emmis,* paras. 44, 84-85).

Accordingly, the Claimant argues that the Rule 41(5) procedure is not a proper forum for resolving a time-bar dispute in the context of a composite act.31\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Observations, para. 17; Claimant\u2019s Second Observation, para. 22(b).\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Observations, para. 19.\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Observations, Section II(B); Claimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 35.\n\n36.\n\nIn Claimant\u2019s view, accepting Mr. Min\u2019s pleaded facts includes assuming his allegation that the acts are interconnected and constitute a composite act.32 The Claimant contends that to uphold the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objection would require the Tribunal to reject Mr. Min\u2019s composite act allegations, which is not permitted by Rule 41(5).33 Additionally, the Claimant observes that certain questions implicated by Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) Objection, such as causation, cannot be answered on a preliminary basis and are for the merits.34\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 2(a).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 22(c).\n\nHearing Tr., p. 70.\n\n37.\n\nThe Claimant observes that the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) Objection, based on the BIT Article 9(7) time-bar provision, only seeks partial dismissal of Mr. Min\u2019s claims, which would not result in any meaningful time and cost savings nor fulfil the *raison d\u2019etre* of Rule 41(5).35\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 2(c).\n\n**B.** **The Time-Bar:** **BIT** **Article** **9(7)**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n38.\n\nArticle 9(7) of the Treaty has been set out above.\n\n39.\n\nIt is not in dispute that the Tribunal must first interpret the BIT Article 9(7) time-bar *\u201cin good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of the words in their context and in light of the Treaty\u2019s object and purpose pursuant to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention.*\u201d36\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 47 (citing Claimant\u2019s First Observations, para. 37). *See also* Rule 41 (5) Objection, paras. 18-19.\n\n40.\n\nWith respect to the interpretation of BIT Article 9(7), the Parties agree that:\n\n(a) The \u201cCut-off Date\u201d for the application of BIT Article 9(7) is 16 July 2017 (*i.e.* three years before the Claimant filed its Request with ICSID)\n\n(b) The BIT Article 9(7) limitation start date *\u201cshould be the date on which an investor 'first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge that he had incurred loss or damage*'.\"37 The Parties also agree that *\u201cknowledge\"* can be either **actual** knowledge or **constructive** knowledge (i.e., what a prudent claimant should have known or must reasonably be deemed to have known by exercise of reasonable care or diligence).38\n\nClaimant\u2019s First Observations, para. 38.

The Respondent explains that such a question depends on the treaty text and the wording of the provision and the Claimant\u2019s pleaded case, and, on these bases, the three cases cited by the Claimant are distinguishable and *\u201cof no avail*\"66 In this particular case, even taking the Claimant\u2019s facts as true, including the composite act, the *\u201cClaimant first knew or should have first known of \u2018loss or damage\u2019 resulting from the Woori Bank Enforcement before the Cut-Off Date\",* and thus, like *Ansung,* the time-bar *\u201cobjection is apt for determination pursuant to the Rule 41(5) procedure, prior to the consideration of the merits*[\u2026]\"67\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 64.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 63(c).\n\n53.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent disputes the Claimant\u2019s assertion that Mr. Min only acquired the requisite knowledge that he had incurred loss or damage as a result of the Woori Bank Enforcement with the Korean Supreme Court judgement of 18 July 2017.68 Citing to ***Apotex,*** the Respondent submits that the Woori Bank Enforcement loss, which culminated with the Manner Transfer, is *\u201cclearly analytically distinct\"* from the loss from the Civil Proceedings.69 Only the first loss, which took place either in July 2013 or early 2015, is the subject of the Rule 41(5) Objection.70 According to the Respondent, the Claimant\u2019s reliance on ***Mobil** **v.** **Canada***,71 does not assist as, in the Claimant\u2019s words, Woori Bank started taking steps to enforce the security in 2011, compelling him to commence the Korean Civil Proceedings in July 2013, and he lost his entire shareholding with the Manner Transfer, which was disclosed to him in \u201c*early 2015*\"72 The Respondent emphasises that the ***Apotex*** decision is directly relevant as it addressed a similar argument and found that *\u201ca discrete government or administrative measure* [...] *is not tolled by litigation, or court decision relating to the measure.*\"73\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 62(b).\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 72 (citing RL-008, *Apotex Inc. v.

Accordingly, the Article 9(7) three-year time-bar applies to the composite act as a whole, so the composite acts which include the Woori Bank Enforcement and the Korean Criminal Proceedings are not time-barred.81\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, paras. 6, 10.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 2(a) and (b).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 2(a).\n\n58.\n\nAdditionally, and alternatively, the Claimant submits that whether these acts constitute composite or continuing acts is a question for the merits, and, for a Rule 41(5) Objection, Mr. Min only needs only to show he has a *\u201ctenable arguable case\u201d* that he acquired the requisite *\u201cknowledge* [that] *he had incurred loss or damage\u201d* on or after the Cut-Off date, which he has met.82\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 2(b).\n\n59.\n\nThe Claimant further notes that the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) objection is not the proper remedy in the present case as at least one of Mr. Min\u2019s *\u201cindisputably surviving claim\u2019s factual matrix requires a close examination of the facts on which other, allegedly time-barred claims are based*\u201d83 Consequently, the Claimant submits that this would not result in any meaningful time or cost savings nor fulfil the *raison d\u2019etre* of Rule 41(5).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 2.\n\n***a. Woori Bank Enforcement***\n-------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Mr. Min\u2019s expropriation and composite FET and denial of justice claims related to the Woori Bank Enforcement are not manifestly time-barred. During the Rule 41(5) Hearing, the Claimant submitted that the Woori Bank Enforcement claim is not a stand-alone claim.84 The Woori Bank Enforcement, the Korean Civil Proceeding and the Korean Criminal Proceedings are interconnected and form part of the composite act that culminated in the expropriation of his investment.85 According to the Claimant, the composite expropriation claim did not crystalise until the Korean Supreme Court\u2019s decision of 18 July 2017, and in January 2015, when the share transfer occurred, *\u201cthe expropriation as claimed by Mr. Min, had not occurred\"* as he was diligently seeking the court\u2019s intervention, so he *\u201ccould not have filed a BIT expropriation case at that point (the case would have been premature).*\"86\n\nHearing Tr., pp. 78-80, and 83.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 47(a).\n\nClaimant\u2019s Hearing Slides, p. 43.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant explains, \u201c[a]*pplying* [the **Mobil**]*standard, \u2018there was no reasonable degree of certainty on the part of Mr Min that he would sustain loss or damage as a result of the Woori Bank Enforcement until the Korean Courts finally disposed of his challenge to its validity*\u2019.\"87 Moreover, the Claimant distinguishes the **Apotex** case on the ground that it did not involve a composite act claim.88\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, paras. 48 and 56.

Korean Criminal Proceedings***\n------------------------------------\n\n63.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the FET and denial of justice claims arising out the Korean Criminal Proceedings are not manifestly time-barred. First, the Korean Criminal Proceedings form part of the composite FET claim, together with the Woori Bank Enforcement and the Korean Civil Proceedings.90 The Claimant submits that Mr. Min only acquired knowledge of *\u201closs or damage\"* arising from the FET breach on 18 July 2017 when the Korean Supreme Court issued its decision.91 The Claimant argues that until that time *\u201cthe Korean State could have itself corrected its actions, and the loss or damage would not have occurred.*\u201d92 Similarly, Mr. Min has a composite denial of justice claim based on the Korean Civil Proceedings and Criminal Proceedings, and Mr. Min also submits that Mr. Min only acquired knowledge of the reasonable certainty of *\u201closs or damage\u201d* arising from the denial of justice breach on 18 July 2017 when the Korean Supreme Court issued its decision.93\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 57.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Hearing Slides, p. 45.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Hearing Slides, p. 45.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Hearing Slides, p. 46.\n\n64.\n\nSecondly, the Claimant argues that the Korean Criminal Proceedings are a continuing breach of the BIT and international law, and each new act, including Mr. Min\u2019s incarceration, constitutes a new breach, which renews the BIT Art. 9(7) limitation period.94 The Claimant further submits that the Tribunal may only determine whether a series of acts constitutes a continuing breach at the merits stage. The Claimant asserts that he has at least a tenable case that the Korean Criminal Proceedings constitute a continuing breach in light of his wrongful incarceration, which happened after the Korean Supreme Court Judgement of 22 March 2017 and continues to date.95\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 57.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 59.\n\n65.\n\nIn addition, should the Tribunal dismiss these claims, the Claimant asserts that there would no efficiencies gained as the Tribunal would still have to examine the underlying facts.96\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 57.\n\n**D.** **Costs**\n----------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Tribunal has the discretion to allocate costs under ICSID Convention Article 61(2). As the two claims are manifestly without legal merit, the Respondent argues that Mr. Min should pay Korea\u2019s costs incurred in connection with the Rule 41(5) Objection, including Korea\u2019s legal fees and expenses and Korea\u2019s share of the Tribunal\u2019s and ICSID\u2019s fees and expenses, plus interest.97\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, paras. 45 and 46(b). Respondent\u2019s Observations, para. 93(c).\n\n67.\n\nThe Claimant similarly requests that the Tribunal order that the Respondent reimburse all of the Claimant\u2019s costs incurred in connection with the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection, including fees and expenses of the arbitrators and legal counsel.98\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 63(b).\n\n**E.** **The Parties\u2019 Request for Relief**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Respondent\u2019s request for relief**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n68.\n\nThe Respondent requests the Tribunal to:\n\n*(a) dismiss with prejudice each of:*\n\n*(i) the Claimant\u2019s claim that the Woori Bank Enforcement individually/separately amounted to an expropriation;*\n\n*(ii) the Claimant's claim that the Korean Criminal Proceedings* *individually/separately* *amounted to a breach of the FET standard and a denial of justice;*\n\n*(iii) the Claimant's claim that the Woori Bank Enforcement and the Korean Civil Proceedings* *collectively/taken together as a composite act* *amounted to an expropriation, to the extent that the Claimant claims loss or damage resulting from the Woori Bank Enforcement; and*\n\n*(iv) the Claimant\u2019s claim that the Korean Criminal Proceedings and the Korean Civil Proceedings* *collectively/taken together as a composite act* *amounted to a breach of the FET standard and a denial of justice, to the extent that the Claimant claims loss or damage resulting from the Korean Criminal Proceedings;*\n\n*(b) declare that each of the Claimant's claims outlined in subparagraph (a) above is outside the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction;*\n\n*(c) order the Claimant to pay the entirety of Korea\u2019s costs incurred in connection with the Rule 41(5) Objection (including Korea\u2019s legal fees and expenses and Korea's share of the Tribunal\u2019s and ICSID\u2019s fees and expenses), plus interest thereon; and*\n\n*(d) order such further or other relief as the Tribunal may deem just and proper.*99\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 93.\n\n**(2) The Claimant\u2019s request for relief**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nThe Claimant requests that the Tribunal grant the following relief:\n\n*(a) A declaration rejecting the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection in its entirety;*\n\n*(b) An order that the Respondent reimburse all of the Claimant's costs incurred in connection with the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection, including fees and expenses of the arbitrators and legal counsel; and*\n\n*(c) Such other relief as may be just and equitable.*100\n\nClaimant\u2019s Second Observations, para. 63.\n\n**VIII. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A.** **Introduction**\n-----------------------\n\n70.\n\nIn deference to the industry of counsel, the Tribunal has summarised at some length the varied and interesting arguments they have advanced. However, the Respondent\u2019s Objection is to *\u201ccertain claims\"* raised by Mr. Min, and not to all of them.101 This means that, whatever the Tribunal decides, this dispute will continue, and some at least of Mr. Min\u2019s claims will go forward for determination. That makes it most important that the Tribunal should not, even if only by a side wind, pre-judge, or appear to pre-judge, any of the factual or legal issues that are going to arise at a later stage.\n\nRule 41(5) Objection, para. 3.\n\n71.\n\nIn the present case, the Objection goes to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. The effect of Article 9(7) is that the Respondent has not agreed to be answerable for claims if more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge that the investor had incurred loss of damage. That said, it is not in dispute that conduct occurring before that date may still be relevant for the purposes of assessing both liability and damages.102\n\nHearing Tr., p. 38; and see RL-010, *Spence,* paras. 212 and 218.\n\n72.\n\nRule 41(5) requires a claim to be *\u201cmanifestly without legal merit\"* before it can be shut out. As held in ***Trans-Global****,* the Respondent must *\u201cestablish its objection clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch.\"*\n\n73.\n\nEven though the word *\u201cefficiency\u201d* is not mentioned in the rule, one obvious purpose of Rule 41(5) is to allow claims that are plainly legally bad to be disposed of quickly, and at an early stage; and it is difficult to see how it could be described as efficient to allow a claim that is manifestly without legal merit to go forward, even if it is based on facts which are also relied in relation to other, more meritorious, claims.\n\n74.\n\nIt is not suggested that the Claimant\u2019s factual allegations are *\u201cincredible, frivolous, vexatious or inaccurate or made in bad faith\u201d.* Accordingly, the Respondent\u2019s application falls to be decided on the basis of a close examination of the Claimant\u2019s case, as pleaded in his Request.\n\n75.\n\nMoreover, that examination must be made in the context of the Respondent\u2019s acceptance, albeit only for the purposes of deciding the Rule 41(5) Objection, that the Woori Bank Enforcement, the Korean Civil Proceedings, and the Korean Criminal Proceedings are inter connected as alleged by the Claimant in his Request.103\n\nRespondent\u2019s Observations, para. 36 quoted above; Hearing Tr., p. 25.\n\n76.\n\nFor these reasons, this is a dispute in which the Tribunal not only can, but should, decide the Objection quite shortly and, as Rule 41(5) provides, do so without prejudice to the Respondent\u2019s right *\u201cto file an objection pursuant to* [Rule 41] *(1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit\u201d.*\n\n**B.** **The Claims Pleaded**\n-----------------------------\n\n77.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s judgment, on a fair reading, paragraphs 61 to 66 of the Request assert the following claims:\n\nA. That Korea failed to accord Mr. Min fair and equitable treatment through the Korean courts\u2019 improper handling of the Korean Civil Proceedings (\u201c*separately*\u201d)*.*\n\nB. That the Korean courts failed to accord him fair and equitable treatment through the Korean courts and other state organs\u2019 improper handling of the Korean Criminal Proceedings (*\u201cseparately*\u201d).\n\nC. That Korea failed to accord him fair and equitable treatment through the Korean courts\u2019 improper handling of the Korean Civil Proceedings and the Korean courts and other State organs\u2019 improper handling of the Korean Criminal Proceedings (*\u201ctaken together as a composite act*\u201d).104\n\nD. That Korea unlawfully expropriated Mr. Min\u2019s investment as a result of Woori Bank\u2019s wrongful enforcement of the Pi Korea Security and execution of the Manner Transfer (\u201c*separately*\u201d).\n\nE. That Korea unlawfully expropriated his investment as a result of the Korean courts\u2019 unlawfully handling of the Korean Civil Proceedings (\"*separately*\u201d).\n\nF. That Korea unlawfully expropriated his investment as a result of Woori Bank\u2019s wrongful enforcement of the Pi Korea Security and execution of the Manner Transfer and the Korean courts\u2019 unlawful handling of the Korean Civil Proceedings (\u201c*taken together as a composite act*\u201d).\n\nIt could be argued that, read literally, the language of paragraph 63 of the Request means that Mr. Min is making a separate claim in respect of each of the assertions listed under the phrase *\u201cincluding but not limited to\u201d* in each of the two bullet points set out in paragraph 62. However, it is clear from the submissions made on his behalf that the Claimant does not put his case on this atomised basis, and this is not how the Tribunal has understood it.\n\n78.\n\nThe division between looking at the acts complained *\u201cseparately\u201d* at A, B, D and E, and *\u201ctaken together as a composite act\u201d* at C and F follows from the *\u201cand/or\u201d* formulation of the claims in paragraphs 62 and 65 of the Request.\n\n79.\n\nThe Claimant has, to some extent, attempted to reformulate his claims at paragraph 6 of his Second Observations and slide 7 and 8 used for the oral submissions. His currently pleaded case, however, is that in the Request. It is that to which the Respondent has objected, and it is that which the Tribunal must examine.\n\n**C.** **The Objection**\n------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Objection, as ultimately developed at the hearing, relates to the entirety of claims B and D, and as regards claims C and F, to any loss or damage which Mr. Min incurred, and of which he knew or should have known, before the Cut-off Date.\n\n81.\n\nAs already mentioned, it is not in dispute that, for the purposes of Article 9(7) of the Treaty, the Cut-off Date is 16 July 2017: that is, after the decision of the Korean Supreme Court dismissing Mr. Min\u2019s appeal against his conviction in the Korean Criminal Proceedings, but before it upheld the judgment of the Seoul District Court in the Korean Civil Proceedings. It is also after Woori Bank had successfully enforced its security over the Pi Korea Shares and executed the Manner Transfer.\n\n82.\n\nMr. Min, of course, knew of the decisions of the Korean Supreme Court in each case when, or very shortly after, they were promulgated; and he knew that Woori Bank had enforced its security not later than March 2015, when he learned of the Woori-Manner SPA and the Manner Transfer.\n\n**D.** **Claim** **D:** **The Woori Bank Enforcement**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nAs already mentioned above, the Claimant disclaims any intention to make a claim based on the Woori Bank Enforcement in and of itself.105 However, in the Tribunal\u2019s judgment, the Request, fairly read, contains such a claim. That being so, the Respondent is entitled to object to it, and the Tribunal ought to rule on that objection.\n\nHearing Tr., pp. 78, 79, 86 and 125.\n\n84.\n\nThis claim, put *\u201cseparately\"* as it is in paragraph 65 of the Request, is manifestly without legal merit on the basis of the facts pleaded by the Claimant himself. The process of enforcement carried out by Woori Bank finally came to an end in January 2015, when the second tranche of Pi Korea Shares was transferred to Manner; and Mr. Min acquired the knowledge that he had lost his shares in the company this way not later than March of that year, long before the Cut-off Date. It is like the claim *\u201cbased exclusively\"* on the FDA Decision in ***Apotex***.106\n\nSee RL-008, *Apotex,* paras. 315-324.\n\n85.\n\nAccordingly, the Woori Bank Enforcement cannot found a stand-alone claim as it is barred by Article 9(7) of the Treaty.\n\n**E.** **Claim** **B:** **The Korean Criminal Proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThis claim alleges a continuing breach stretching from the initiation of the criminal investigation of Mr. Min in 2010 to the present day, when he remains imprisoned in Korea.107\n\nHearing Tr., pp. 71-72.\n\n87.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s judgment, whether for the purposes of the Treaty the conduct complained of can properly be characterised as a continuing breach is a matter to be determined on the merits, not on a Rule 41(5) Objection.\n\n88.\n\nThe application of time limits to what are alleged to be continuing breaches has led to conflicting views from different tribunals: see for example: ***UPS*** paragraphs 24 to 30, and ***Spence*** at paragraphs 212 and 218 and ***Ansung*** paragraphs 112 to 114.\n\n89.\n\nAlthough Mr. Min\u2019s conviction was finally confirmed, and his imprisonment began, before the Cut-off Date, it is at least arguable that any loss or damage he may have incurred since that date is not time-barred. Such post Cut-off Date loss or damage may arguably have been caused by fresh breaches, rather than being the effect of an earlier breach which caused pre Cut-off Date loss or damage about which he knew, or ought to have known, before that date.\n\n90.\n\nAccordingly, Claim B as a whole cannot be said to be manifestly without legal merit.\n\n**F.** **Claims** **C** **and** **F:** **The Composite Claims**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nClaims C and F are pleaded as composite acts which it is said in each case breached the Treaty. Such a breach consists *of \u201ca series of acts or omissions defined in aggregate as wrongful*\u201d.108\n\nSee CL-010, Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Article 15.\n\n92.\n\nWhere a series of acts or omissions is properly so characterised, it is arguable that there is no breach until the series is complete. It is also arguable that the time when the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge that he has incurred loss or damage cannot arise until the breach itself has occurred. For without an alleged breach there cannot be a dispute, or a claim, at all.109\n\nSee Article 9(1) of the Treaty, quoted above.\n\n93.\n\nFor the purpose of determining the Rule 41(5) Objection, the Respondent accepts that, as pleaded, the Woori Bank Enforcement, the Korean Criminal Proceedings, and the Korean Civil Proceedings are interconnected. That being so, in the Tribunal\u2019s judgment, it must be open to the Claimant to plead claims C and F as it has. As pleaded, in each case the composite act was not complete until the final decision of the Korean Supreme Court in the Korean Civil Proceedings on 18 July 2017, two days after the Cut-off Date.\n\n94.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the decision in ***Apotex.*** However, in that case the respondent and the tribunal rejected any suggestion that the (out of time) FDA Decision could be linked to the subsequent (within time) Federal Court Decisions. In the present case, by contrast, for the purposes of this Objection the interconnection between the facts alleged constitute composite acts is accepted. Moreover, there appears to have been no equivalent in ***Apotex*** to the allegation in paragraph 7 of the Request110 in this case.\n\nSee para. 21 above.\n\n95.\n\nOnce it is accepted that a claim based on an alleged composite act is *prima facie* timeous and thus not barred as a whole by Article 9(7), the Tribunal does not think it appropriate to go on to parse that claim and examine whether parts of the loss or damage alleged to be attributable to the breach are irrecoverable because they were incurred, and known to the investor, before the Cut-off Date. If the claim as a whole is not manifestly without legal merit, the question of what loss is recoverable, if liability is established, should here be left for the hearing on the merits.\n\n96.\n\nAccordingly, neither claim C nor claim F can be said to be manifestly without legal merit.\n\n**IX. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n97.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s judgment, the appropriate order to make at this stage is to reserve the costs of this Rule 41(5) Objection.\n\n**X. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n98.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) Claim B, that the Korean courts failed to accord the Claimant fair and equitable treatment through the Korean courts and other State organs\u2019 improper handling of the Korean Criminal Proceedings, is not as a whole manifestly without legal merit;\n\n(2) Claim C, that Korea failed to accord the Claimant fair and equitable treatment through the Korean courts\u2019 improper handling of the Korean Civil Proceedings and the Korean courts and other State organs\u2019 improper handling of the Korean Criminal Proceedings, taken together as a composite act, is not manifestly without legal merit;\n\n(3) Claim D, that Korea unlawfully expropriated Mr. Min\u2019s investment as a result of Woori Bank\u2019s wrongful enforcement of the Pi Korea Security and execution of the Manner Transfer, and based exclusively thereon, is manifestly without legal merit;\n\n(4) Claim F, that Korea unlawfully expropriated the Claimant\u2019s investment as a result of Woori Bank\u2019s wrongful enforcement of the Pi Korea Security and execution of the Manner Transfer and the Korean courts\u2019 unlawful handling of the Korean Civil Proceedings, taken together as a composite act, is not manifestly without legal merit; and\n\n(5) The costs of and incidental to this Rule 41(5) Objection are reserved."}]}
