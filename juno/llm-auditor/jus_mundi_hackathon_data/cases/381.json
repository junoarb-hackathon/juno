INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 15 July 1994, which entered into force on 31 October 1995 (the **\"BIT\"** or **\"Treaty\"),** and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the **\"ICSID Convention\").**\n\n2.\n\nClaimant is Gambrinus Corporation and is hereinafter referred to as **\"Gambrinus\"** or the **\"Claimant.\"**\n\n3.\n\nClaimant is a company incorporated under the laws of Barbados.\n\n4.\n\nRespondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and is hereinafter referred to as **\"Venezuela\"** or the **\"Respondent.\"**\n\n5.\n\nClaimant and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the **\"Parties.\"** The Parties\u2019 respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n**II. OVERVIEW OF THE CASE AND PARTIES' REQUEST FOR RELIEF**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe dispute relates to the alleged expropriation by Respondent of Claimant\u2019s ten percent (10%) equity interest in a group of four Venezuelan companies, jointly referred to as Fertinitro,1 which produces nitrogen fertilizers (ammonia and urea) for export and internal use in Venezuela, through the operation and maintenance of four petrochemical plants.\n\nFertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente, S.A.; Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente, C.E.C.; Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, SRL; and Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, Fertinitro, C.E.C. (collectively referred to as **\"Fertinitro\").**\n\n7.\n\nA Joint Investors\u2019 Agreement establishing Fertinitro was concluded on 8 April 1998, and the plants commenced commercial operations in 2001.\n\n8.\n\nFertinitro\u2019s structure included four original shareholders at the top: Petroqu\u00edmica de Venezuela S.A. **(\"Pequiven\")** a wholly owned subsidiary of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), the state-owned oil company, Polar Uno C.A. **(\"Polar\")** a company incorporated in Venezuela, Koch Oil S.A. (later denominated Koch Minerals S.a.r.l., **(\"Koch\")),** a company incorporated in Switzerland, and Snamprogetti B.V. **(\"Snamprogetti\"),** a company incorporated in the Netherlands. In January 2008, Polar -under a new denomination- namely Inversiones Polar S.A. **(\"Inv. Polar\")2** executed a transaction with the purpose of transferring its interest in Fertinitro to Gambrinus, the Claimant in this arbitration.\n\n*See infra* \u00b6 46.\n\n9.\n\nOn 11 October 2010, Expropriation Decree No. 7713 dated 10 October 2010, declaring the compulsory acquisition of the assets of Fertinitro came into effect. The Decree directed Pequiven, a 35% equity-holder in Fertinitro, to act as the \"expropriating entity\" and carry out \"the forced acquisition... of all the real and personal property... belonging or currently in the possession of Fertinitro.\"3\n\nDecree Law No. 7,713 of 10 October 2010, Official Gazette No. 39,528 dated 11 October 2010 (the **\"Expropriation Decree\")** (C-2).\n\n10.\n\nTo date, Gambrinus has not received compensation from Venezuela for the forced acquisition of its alleged investment in Fertinitro. According to Claimant, Respondent is thus liable for breaches of Venezuela\u2019s obligations to Claimant, a protected \"Company\" under the terms of the BIT.4\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 6.\n\n11.\n\nGambrinus requests that the Arbitral Tribunal issue an Award:\n\n(a) Declaring that Respondent is in breach of its obligations under, among other provisions, Articles 5, 2(2) and 3 of the Treaty, as well as customary international law, and that, by virtue of the violations of the Venezuelan Expropriation Law, Respondent is in further breach of Articles 5, 2(2) and 3 of the Treaty;\n\n(b) Ordering that Respondent pay Claimant full compensation with respect to said breaches of the Treaty and international law, in an amount of USD150,404,359.00 million, to bear interest at a rate no less than the Venezuela sovereign debt rate, compounded annually (or monthly LIBOR+8%, compounded monthly, or such other rate as the Tribunal deems fit) until the date of the Award;\n\n(c) Ordering that Respondent pay all costs of and associated with this arbitration, including Claimant\u2019s legal fees, experts\u2019 fees, disbursements, administrative fees and the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal;\n\n(d) Ordering that post-Award interest shall continue to run on all sums so awarded at the Venezuela sovereign debt rate, compounded annually (or monthly LIBOR+8%, compounded monthly, or such other rate as the Tribunal deems fit) until the date of payment; and\n\n(e) Granting such other and further relief as the Arbitral Tribunal deems just and proper.5\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 186; Cl. Reply, \u00b6 319, containing an updated damages figure.\n\n12.\n\nFor its part, Venezuela contends that Gambrinus is not a foreign investor in Venezuela, it has made no investment, suffered no detriment and has taken no risk. The belated transfer from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus was made in clear breach of the Founding Agreements of Fertinitro such that Gambrinus never received title to shares in Fertinitro, and in all cases the transfer was made at such time as to fabricate jurisdiction.6\n\nResp. PHB (II), \u00b6 6.\n\n13.\n\nRespondent requests that the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n(a) decline jurisdiction in the present proceedings;\n\n(b) in the alternative, dismiss all of Claimant\u2019s claims in finding that Respondent has not breached its obligations either under the BIT or international law;\n\n(c) in the alternative, if the Tribunal should decide to make an award in favour of Claimant, limit the award to a maximum amount of USD 13.7 million;\n\n(d) order Claimant to pay all costs incurred in connection with these arbitration proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and those associated with ICSID, as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by Respondent, including the fees of legal counsel and experts, plus interest; and\n\n(e) order such other relief as the Tribunal, in its discretion, considers appropriate.7\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 623; Resp. PHB (II), \u00b6 78.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. The Institution of Proceedings and the Constitution of the Tribunal**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 9 November 2011, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 8 November 2011 from Gambrinus Corporation against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the **\"Request\"** or **\"RfA\").** The Request was supplemented by a letter dated 1 December 2011, answering questions posed by the Centre.\n\n15.\n\nOn 2 December 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre\u2019s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n16.\n\nIn the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the method of constituting the Tribunal, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the formula set forth under Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Piero Bernardini, a national of Italy, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties, Marc Lalonde a national of Canada, appointed by Claimant, and Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a national of France, appointed by Respondent.\n\n18.\n\nThe President of the Tribunal accepted his appointment on 24 April 2012, and his coarbitrators on 8 February 2012, and 15 March 2012, respectively.\n\n19.\n\nOn 24 April 2012, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **\"Arbitration Rules\"****),** the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Mair\u00e9e Uran-Bidegain, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**B. The First Session of the Tribunal and the Exchange of Written Pleadings**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 12 July 2012. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed *inter alia* that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that both English and Spanish would be the procedural languages of the arbitration and that the place of proceeding would be Paris, France. The Parties agreed on a schedule for the jurisdictional/merits phase of the proceedings. The agreement of the Parties was embodied in Procedural Order No. 1 signed by the President and circulated to the Parties on 23 July 2012, supplemented by letters of 30 July 2012 and 26 September 2012.\n\n21.\n\nOn 8 June 2012, Respondent submitted a request to address the objections to jurisdiction as a preliminary question (the **\"Bifurcation Request\").** This was followed by Claimant\u2019s Observations on the Bifurcation Request on 22 June 2012.\n\n22.\n\nOn 6 July 2012, Respondent submitted a response to Claimant\u2019s Observations of 22 June 2012, and on 9 July 2012, Claimant submitted final observations on the Bifurcation Request.\n\n23.\n\nOn 30 July 2012, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties of the Tribunal\u2019s decision not to bifurcate the proceedings, joining Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction to the merits.\n\n24.\n\nFollowing the schedule agreed between the Parties and the Tribunal during the first session, for a non-bifurcated procedure, the Parties filed their written pleadings as follows:\n\n(a) Claimant filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits, and *Quantum* on 30 November 2012, accompanied by a witness statement of Mr. Reinaldo Gabald\u00f3n and an expert report of Mr. Brent Kaczmarek of Navigant;\n\n(b) Respondent filed its \"Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits, and *Quantum,\"* on 17 May 2013, accompanied by witness statements of Francisco Toro and Sim\u00f3n Escobar, Legal Opinions by Professors Iribarren and Garcia Montoya, and a valuation report by Dr. Daniel Flores of EconOne;\n\n(c) Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits and its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, on 30 August 2013, accompanied by a second witness statement from Mr. Reinaldo Gabald\u00f3n, a legal opinion by Dr. Carlos Ayala Carao, an expert report by Dr. Flessner and a second valuation report by Mr. Kaczmarek;\n\n(d) Respondent filed its \"Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Merits and *Quantum,\"* on 29 November 2013, accompanied by second witness statements by Messrs. Toro and Escobar, as well as second legal opinions by Messrs. Montoya and Iribarren and a second valuation report by Dr. Daniel Flores;\n\n(e) Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 17 January 2014 accompanied by a third witness statement by Mr. Reinaldo Gabald\u00f3n and a third valuation report by Mr. Brent Kaczmarek.\n\n**C. The Hearing**\n------------------\n\n25.\n\nA pre-hearing organizational meeting was held with the Parties by telephone conference on 24 February 2014.\n\n26.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction, merits and *quantum,* took place at the World Bank offices in Paris from 10-13 March 2014 (the **\"Hearing\").** In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the hearing were:\n\nFor Claimant :\n\nKaryl Naim Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP\n\nTimothy G. Nelson Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP\n\nJulie B\u00e9dard Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP\n\nGunjan Sharma Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP\n\nKatherine Porter Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP\n\nMargarita Morales-Diaz Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP\n\nCharlotte Woodley Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP\n\nFor Respondent :\n\nLuis Bottaro Hogan Lovells (Caracas)\n\nGonzalo Rodriguez-Matos Hogan Lovells (Caracas)\n\nLaurent Gouiff\u00e9s Hogan Lovells (Paris)\n\nCarmen N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Lagos Hogan Lovells (Paris)\n\nThomas Kendra Hogan Lovells (Paris)\n\nMelissa Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez Hogan Lovells (Paris)\n\nMarianna Boza Hogan Lovells\n\nCarlos Rodr\u00edguez Hogan Lovells\n\nAnna Bonini Hogan Lovells\n\n27.\n\nThe following persons were examined:\n\nOn behalf of Claimant :\n\nMr. Reinaldo Gabald\u00f3n Witness\n\nProf. Carlos Ayala Carao Expert Witness\n\nMr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA Expert Witness, Navigant Consulting\n\nOn behalf of Respondent:\n\nProf. Henrique Iribarren Monteverde Expert Witness\n\nDr. Daniel Flores Expert Witness, Econ One Research\n\n**D. The Additional Argument and Post-Hearing Submissions**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n28.\n\nOn 18 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 authorizing Respondent to deal with a particular jurisdictional argument relating to Respondent\u2019s allegations that Claimant had failed to comply with the terms of Section 6.7 of the Joint Investors Agreement and therefore failed to obtain valid title to the Fertinitro shares.\n\n29.\n\nIn accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, on 16 May 2014, Respondent filed a written submission on the Invalidity of the Purported Share Transfer from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus; and on 21 July 2014, Claimant answered Respondent\u2019s submission of 16 May 2014.\n\n30.\n\nOn 29 August 2014, the Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs, and on 26 September 2014, the Parties filed simultaneous Reply post-hearing briefs.\n\n**E. Submissions on Cost**\n--------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Parties filed simultaneous costs submissions on 17 October 2014 and reply costs submissions on 31 October 2014.\n\n**F. Closure of Proceedings**\n-----------------------------\n\n32.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on 21 April 2015.\n\n**IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n33.\n\nThe Tribunal summarizes below in chronological order, insofar as relevant to make its determination, the factual background of these proceedings.\n\n**A. The Project**\n------------------\n\n34.\n\nDuring the 90s, Venezuela was a net importer of agricultural products and by the end of the decade it imported up to 64% of the internal food consumption.8 Against this background, Venezuela decided to increase its production of fertilizers.9\n\nR. Gott, Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela, Verso 2011 (R-10), p. 164.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 31.\n\n35.\n\nDuring that time, Pequiven sought private partners to participate in the development of a fertilizer production facility.\n\n36.\n\nOn 14 October 1997, Pequiven, Polar, Koch, and Snamprogetti, concluded a ***Fertilizer Development Agreement,*** setting forth the framework for the creation of a joint venture for the construction and operation of a fertilizer production facility, namely two ammonia and two urea plants, together with the commercialization in both local and export markets, of the ammonia and urea produced by the plants (the **\"Project\").10** Ammonia and urea are both fertilizers used to increase crop productivity.11\n\nFertilizer Development Agreement dated 14 October 1997 by and among Petroqu\u00edmica de Venezuela, S.A. (PEQUIVEN), Koch Oil, S.A., Snamprogetti Netherlands B.V. and Polar Uno, C.A. **(\"Fertilizer Development Agreement\") (RG-2).**\n\nC. J. Overdahl, *et. at,* \"Fertilizer Urea,\" University of Minnesota College of Agriculture, Food, and Environment sciences, Extension Soils Specialist (1991) (R-14), p. 1.\n\n37.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the selection of the participants to the Project was made *intuitu personae.* Koch had experience in international and U.S. markets for production and distribution of fertilizers; Pequiven had experience in the fertilizers national market; Snamprogetti had experience in the construction of industrial plants and would serve as the engineering, procurement and construction contractor and become a shareholder; and Polar, one of Venezuela\u2019s largest private business, was invited to participate in the project as a domestic partner, in order to inspire confidence in Venezuela\u2019s environment and thereby attract external funding.12\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 34-36; 46.\n\n38.\n\nOn 8 April 1998, Pequiven, Koch, Snamprogetti and Polar concluded a ***Joint Investors\u2019 Agreement*** **(\"JIA\"),** setting forth the contractual framework for the construction, operation and investment terms of the two ammonia plants, each with a minimum nameplate capacity of 1,800 metric tons of ammonia per day, and of the two urea plants, each with a minimum nameplate capacity of 2,200 metric tons of urea per day.13 Pursuant to the JIA, the four joint investors (also referred to as **\"Owners\"** under the terms of the JIA), agreed on the creation of the following Venezuelan companies:\n\n\u25a0 Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente S.A.; (the **\"Company\")**\n\n\u25a0 Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente C.E.C.; (the \"***Comandita\")***\n\n\u25a0 Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, SRL; and\n\n\u25a0 Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, Fertinitro C.E.C. (the **\"Operating Company\").**\n\nJoint Investors\u2019 Agreement dated 8 April 1998 by and among Petroqu\u00edmica de Venezuela, S.A. (PEQUIVEN), Koch Oil, S.A., Snamprogetti B.V. and Polar Uno, C.A. (the **\"Joint Investors Agreement\" (\"JIA\"))** (C-6), Recitals pp.l-4.\n\n39.\n\nThese four companies are jointly referred to as **\"Fertinitro.\"** Section 2.1 of JIA, provided for the ownership structure of Fertinitro as follows:\n\n\u25a0 35% owned by Pequiven (as holder of Class A shares in the Company, and Class V shares in the *Comandita);*\n\n\u25a0 35% owned by Koch (as holder of Class B shares in the Company, and Class W shares in the *Comandita);*\n\n\u25a0 20% owned by Snamprogetti (as holder of Class C shares in the Company, and Class X shares in the *Comandita);* and\n\n\u25a0 10% owned by Polar (as holder of Class D shares in the Company, and Class Y shares in the *Comandita).*\n\n40.\n\nKoch and Polar owned their respective interests in the Project through wholly owned \"Special Purposes Subsidiaries\" (as defined in the JIA), namely Koch Jos\u00e9 Cayman Islands Limited **(\"Koch Jos\u00e9\"),** and Polar Jos\u00e9 Investments Limited, **(\"Polar Jos\u00e9\")** respectively, both companies organized under the laws of Cayman Islands.14 In accordance with Section 2.4 of the JIA, and the Recitals, Koch and Polar as Owners, remained responsible together with the Special Purpose Subsidiaries for compliance with all the obligations under the JIA. Moreover, the only assets of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries were the shares or debt in the Fertinitro Companies. By 18 February 1998, Koch transferred 28,571% of its interest in Koch Jos\u00e9 to Latin American Investment Fund **(\"LAIF\").** LAIF then became a 10% shareholder of Fertinitro.\n\nJoint Investors\u2019 Agreement (C-6), Recitals, p. 2, and Section 2.4.\n\n41.\n\nOn or around the same date of the conclusion of the JIA, several agreements related to the construction, maintenance and financing of Fertinitro were also executed. Among others, on 8 April 1998, Koch, Pequiven and International Petrochemical Sales Limited **(\"IPSL\")** (an affiliate of Pequiven), executed a 20 years ***Offtake Agreement,*** pursuant to which both Koch and Pequiven/IPSL, agreed to buy ammonia and urea produced by Fertinitro on a \"Take-or-Pay\" basis until the loans taken out by Fertinitro to finance the project would be repaid.15 Neither Polar nor Polar Jos\u00e9 were parties to the Offtake Agreement and had no role in marketing or selling Fertinitro\u2019s output.\n\nOfftake Agreement dated 8 April 2008 by and among Petroquimica de Venezuela, S.A. (Pequiven), International Petrochemical Sales Limited and Koch Oil, S.A., as buyers and Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, Fertinitro, C.E.C., as Seller (the **\"Offtake Agreement\")** (RG-6), Art 3.2.\n\n42.\n\nThe sales of fertilizers to the international market were regulated by Article 2.3 of the Offtake Agreement, pursuant to which, Pequiven and IPSL had the right to market and sale output in South and Central America and the Caribbean, including Venezuela, and Koch, had the right to market and sale output in the North American markets.16\n\n*Ibid.,* Art. 2.3.\n\n43.\n\nUnder the Offtake Agreement, Pequiven\u2019s potential sale of fertilizers to the Venezuelan market was limited to 10% of its allocated output. This percentage was increased to 15% three years later, and by 1% per year thereafter.17 In addition, the Offtake Agreement set a specific formula to determine the price at which Koch and Pequiven were entitled to buy urea and ammonia from Fertinitro for resale or for their own consumption.18\n\n*Ibid.,* Art. 2.5.\n\n*Ibid.,* Art. 3.1.\n\n44.\n\nThe project finance structure contained many other service and financing agreements, including an ***Equity Contribution Agreement,*** setting forth the obligations of the Owners to fund their capital contributions to the constituent Fertinitro entities, the ***Common Security Agreement,*** and the ***Transfer Restrictions Agreement,*** setting forth the transfer requirements requested by the Project lenders.19\n\nEquity Contribution Agreement dated 21 April 1998 (RG-7); Common Security Agreement dated 21 April 1998 (RG-8); Transfer Restrictions Agreement dated 21 April 1998 (RG-9).\n\n45.\n\nIn 2001, Snamprogetti completed the construction of the Fertinitro plants and facilities, and commercial production commenced the same year.20\n\n*See* Report of Independent Accountants and Financial Statements dated 31 December 2001 and 2002, n. 1, p. 9 (R-17).\n\n46.\n\nOn 12 May 1998, Polar Uno C.A., the Venezuelan company that concluded the JIA, changed its name to Inversiones Polar S.A. (Inv. Polar).21 Three years later, on 6 August 2001, Inv. Polar decided to remove Polar Jos\u00e9 (the Special Purpose Subsidiary of the Cayman Island),22 from the Fertinitro investment structure and instead, to own its shares through Inv. Polar, the Parent Company. According to Claimant, this was in response to a change in Venezuela\u2019s tax law that established a list of \"low tax jurisdictions,\" which included the Cayman Islands.23 Consequently, Polar Jos\u00e9 notified the Fertinitro shareholders and lenders that it was transferring all its interest in Fertinitro, previously owned through Polar Jos\u00e9, to be owned directly by Inv. Polar.24 Polar Jos\u00e9 completed the transaction without objection from the other shareholders.25\n\n*See* Inversiones Polar Name Change, Corporate Registry *(Cambio de denominaci\u00f3n social ante Registrador Mercantil Primero de la Circunscripci\u00f3n Judicial)* accompanied by Minutes of the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting held on 12 May 1998) (RG-1).\n\n*See supra,* \u00b6 40.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 32.\n\nNotification of Transfer to Trustees dated 6 August 2001 (RG-18). *See also supra,* \u00b6 8, n. 2.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 32.\n\n47.\n\nFertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente S.A., the Company, was at the corporate structure\u2019s effective peak.26 The management of Fertinitro was carried out through a nine-member Board of Directors for each of the four companies mentioned above, with the Board of the Company at its top. Pequiven appointed 3 members, Koch and LAIF appointed 3 members in total, Snamprogetti appointing 2 members and Polar Jos\u00e9, appointed one member, to each of the boards. In addition, each shareholder appointed one or more alternate directors.27 Certain management functions such as, for example, the appointment of the Chairman of the Board, were reserved to Koch and Pequiven, the largest shareholders.28\n\nIn accordance with the JIA, the Company was set to be the sole or majority owner of interests in the other companies that constituted the Investment Structure; *see* JIA (C-6), Recitals p. 1 and Investment Structure (Exh. A to the JIA).\n\nJIA (C-6), \u00b6\u00b6 5.2.1 and 5.2.2.\n\n*See ibid.* (C-6), \u00b6 5.2.4.\n\n48.\n\nPolar Jos\u00e9, Inv. Polar and Gambrinus appointed Messrs. Hernan Anzola, and Oscar Grossman as Directors, in different periods, and Mr. Reinaldo Gabald\u00f3n as Alternate Director. Mr. Gabald\u00f3n is acting as witness in the present proceedings.\n\n49.\n\nPequiven appointed several directors, including Mr. Francisco Toro, as Director and Alternate Director. Mr. Toro submitted two witness statements in these proceedings. Mr. Francisco Toro passed away in February 2014.\n\n**B. Renegotiation of Agreements and Potential Buy-Out of Private Shareholders by Pequiven**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nBetween 2001 and 2005, LAIF and Pequiven requested at different times an agreement from the Fertinitro Board of Directors to amend the Offtake Agreement. On the one hand, LAIF was concerned that the \"off takers\" were paying below-market price for urea, to Fertinitro\u2019s detriment, and requested that the price be raised.29 On the other hand, Pequiven requested the right to purchase additional urea at a reduced price (from the price agreed in the Offtake Agreement), for resale in the Venezuela market for the period between 2005 and 2007.30 From 2005 to 2006 directors and shareholders continued to discuss potential revisions to the Offtake Agreement.31 However no agreement was ever reached.32\n\nIn April 2005, at the request of the Fertinitro Board of Directors, Blue, Johnson and Associates, an independent consulting firm issued a report reflecting the results of its review of the Offtake Agreement. The firm had been approached to review the efficiency and implications of the Agreement\u2019s pricing mechanism on the revenue being generated to the venture and its investors. It concluded that the Agreement was harming the company\u2019s profitability, as it resulted in more benefits for Koch and Pequiven/IPSL, but less revenue for the other shareholders. The off-takers had an economic incentive not to amend the Offtake Agreement. *See* Presentation Report prepared by Blue Johnson & Associates INC dated 5 April 2005 (R-22); Cl.

Concomitantly, the Board of Directors discussed the potential effects of Venezuela\u2019s policies of seeking additional State control over petrochemical activities. For example, on 18 January 2007, Mr. Parra, one of Koch\u2019s directors reported that Mr. Toro, Pequiven\u2019s appointed alternate director, had informed the board that \"time ha[d] run out and Pequiven must take control of the Offtake and business\"; \"Fertinitro must be run by the Venezuelan State;\" and \"all shareholders\u2019 rights and agreement will be respected.\"33\n\n*See* Email from T. Parra to F. Toro and A. Zavala dated 18 January 2007 (R-88), and Email from T. Parra to R. Gabald\u00f3n dated 18 January 2007 (RG-128).\n\n52.\n\nLess than a month later, on 8 February 2007, Mr. Francisco Toro, reiterated to the Board of Directors a similar statement:\n\n[G]iven the policies of the Venezuelan State, which were supported by Pequiven, it would be necessary to search for a way and design a process by which control of the production and marketing of Fertinitro\u2019s fertilizer could be handed over to Pequiven. Mr. Toro repeated that existing agreements would be honored but that this step was inevitable and would have to be completed within a matter of months. He added that Pequiven would soon be holding individual talks with each shareholder to try to reach an amicable agreement on the matter.34\n\nMinutes of Board of Directors Meeting No. 78 held on 8 February 2007 **(\"Minutes of Board of Directors Meeting No. 78\")** (R-36 / RG-68 with translation), p. 2.\n\n53.\n\nThe Parties disagree on whether these communications could be considered as a threat of a potential expropriation35 or a confirmation of Pequiven\u2019s desire to buy the other shareholders\u2019 interest at a fair and arms-length value.36\n\nResp.

Mr. Z\u00e1ldivar, Pequiven\u2019s external counsel, also is said to have advised Mr. Gabald\u00f3n at that same time that the government of Venezuela was not nationalizing Fertinitro; *see* Reinaldo Gabald\u00f3n\u2019s Personal Notes from December 11, 2007 Meeting with Miguel Zaldivar (Partner, Hogan & Hartson LLP) (RG-114).\n\n54.\n\nIn late 2007, the shareholders negotiated a draft Memorandum of Understanding **(\"MOU\")** concerning the sale.37 The MOU was not executed. The Parties differ on the reasons for which the transaction was not completed.38\n\nDraft Memorandum of Understanding (2007) (RG-3 6) (Nav. 116). The draft MOU provided by both Parties contains track changes and therefore may not be the latest version.\n\nClaimants state that the lack of financing by Pequiven prevented the deal from going through, as the price was set in agreement by all shareholders including Pequiven *(see* Cl. Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 51-52; Cl. Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 34-35). According to Respondent, Koch had set a price exceeding the reasonable valuation of the plant and this broke the negotiations *(see* Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6 126).\n\n**C. The Share-Transfer from Inv. Polar to Claimant and the Additional Capital Contribution Agreement**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nOn 21 January 2008, pursuant to Section 6.2.2 of the JIA and Section 12(b) of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and the *Comandita,* Inv.

The dividend was paid in dollars to all shareholders, including Pequiven.51 To allow this dividend, the lenders required the signature of an additional agreement, namely the ***Additional Capital Contribution Agreement,*** concluded by Gambrinus, Cervecer\u00eda Polar, Pequiven, Koch (and its affiliates) and Snamprogretti (and its affiliates) on 29 April 2008. In this agreement the parties, (1) acknowledged the selling requirements to the Venezuelan market imposed by the Urea Decree52 and, (2) stated that \"to support the financial viability of the Project\" the shareholders would provide additional capital contributions to Fertinitro, in the event of a \"shortfall\" in Fertinitro\u2019s debt payment to senior Lenders.53 No contribution was ultimately necessary.54\n\nReport of Independent Auditors for FertiNitro Venezuela, C.E.C. dated 31 December 2008 and 2007 (English) (RG-21), p. 24.\n\n*See* description of the Urea Decree *infra,* \u00b6 68.\n\nShareholder Additional Equity Contribution Agreement dated 29 April 2008 (R-66), Recitals, Art. 3.\n\nResp.

According to Respondent, the government developed several other plans with the purpose of furthering food self-sufficiency and food security. Ensuring adequate fertilizer supply was one of the elements of these plans.60 Claimant emphasizes that the Plans contemplated the continued presence of the private sector.61\n\nPlan for the Economic and Social Development of the Nation, September 2001 (R-25).\n\nNational Project Sim\u00f3n Bolivar, First Socialist Plan, Economic and Social Development of the Nation, September 2007 **(\"Sim\u00f3n Bolivar Plan\")** (R-35).\n\nPlan for the Economic and Social Development of the Nation (R-25), p. 32, \u00b6 1.1.3.1.\n\nSim\u00f3n Bolivar Plan (R-35), p. 22.\n\nResp.

In 2004, the domestic urea demand was not satisfied by the domestic production, and Venezuela imported urea.63\n\n*See* Report: Volumetric Impact of Decree 5218 on FertiNitro Operations, Empresas Polar dated July 2007 (RG-86). *See also,* Tr.

JURISDICTION**\n-------------------\n\n**A. Introduction**\n-------------------\n\n87.\n\nRespondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione personae, ratione temporis* and *ratione materiae,* under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, alleging *inter alia* that (A) Gambrinus is not a protected foreign investor and Polar\u2019s use of Gambrinus\u2019s legal personality is an abuse of corporate personality; (B) the dispute pre-dates the \"interposition\" of Gambrinus in the corporate structure and/or was reasonably foreseeable at that time; and (C) Gambrinus made no investment, as it has not proved title to the Fertinitro shares and its purported interest is not an \"investment\" for purposes of the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n88.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that jurisdiction in the present case is subject to a dual test, meaning that it must exist both under the ICSID Convention and the applicable investment protection treaty, the Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela dated 15 July 1994 and in force on 31 October 1995.\n\n89.\n\nICSID jurisdiction and the competence of this Tribunal derive from Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, which states in relevant part:\n\n(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) 'National of another Contracting State' means:\n\n\u2026\n\n(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a national of another Contracting State for the purpose of this Convention\".\n\n90.\n\nArticle 1 (a) of the BIT defines \"investment\" as \"every kind of assets invested by nationals or companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party [...].\" Article 1(d) defines \"companies\" as meaning, \"in respect of each Contracting Party, corporations, firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in that Contracting Party. For the purpose of the Convention referred to in Article 8 [ICSID Convention] 'Company' shall include any company incorporated or constituted under the law in force in one Contracting Party which is owned or effectively controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n91.\n\nArticle 8 of the BIT sets forth the disputes that may be submitted to arbitration according to the BIT and the ICSID Convention:\n\n(1) Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the national concerned, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on March 18, 1965.\n\n\u2026\n\n\u2026\n\n(4) Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.\n\n92.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the Centre depends first and foremost on the consent of the parties.97 Tribunals shall exercise jurisdiction over all disputes that fall within the scope of the parties\u2019 consent as long as the dispute satisfies the objective requirements set forth in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. In the words of Professor Aaron Broches, the purpose of Article 25(2)(b) is to\n\n... indicate the outer limits within which disputes may be submitted to conciliation or arbitration under the auspices of the Centre with the consent of the parties thereto. Therefore the parties should be given the widest possible latitude to agree on the meaning of \"nationality\" and any stipulation of nationality made in connection with a conciliation or arbitration clause which is based on a reasonable criterion should be accepted.98\n\nReport of the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Dispute between States and National of Other States, 1 ICSID Reports 28, stating that \"[c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre\" (\u00b6 23).\n\nA. Broches, \"The Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States,\" 136 Recueil des Cours, 331, p. 361 (1972-11).\n\n93.\n\nRegarding the \"outer limits within which disputes may be submitted to conciliation and arbitration,\" Broches points specifically to a situation where it should not be permitted to the parties \"to use the Convention for purposes for which it was clearly not intended.\"99\n\nA. Broches, *cit., ibid.*\n\n94.\n\nBased on Article 25 of the Convention and the BIT this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute if the following requirements are met: (1) Claimant is a \"national or company\" of a Contracting Party to the BIT and a \"national of another Contracting State\" to the ICSID Convention; (2) Claimant has an \"investment\" in the territory of the other Contracting Party and in accordance with the ICSID Convention; (3) the legal dispute arises directly from the investment; and (4) the parties to the dispute have consented to ICSID jurisdiction over it.\n\n95.\n\nBearing in mind the principles that have just been recalled, the Tribunal shall now examine Respondent\u2019s arguments that there is no jurisdiction *ratione personae, ratione temporis* and *ratione materiae.*\n\n**B. The Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Personae***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Gambrinus is not a foreign investor in Venezuela: the only true investor is Polar, a Venezuelan corporation, and the mere incorporation of Gambrinus in Barbados is not sufficient for Gambrinus to qualify as an \"investor\" for purposes of the BIT and the ICSID Convention.100 Claimant, in turn, argues that Gambrinus is a purposeful investor under the BIT, since it is incorporated in Barbados and there are no reasons to disregard Claimant\u2019s Barbadian citizenship. Moreover, it is established practice that any agreement on nationality included in the BIT, also satisfies the definition of \"national of another contracting state\" for purposes of the ICSID Convention, and thus this Tribunal has jurisdiction *ratione personae* over Claimant.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 164-236; Resp. PHB (I), \u00b6\u00b6 43-48.\n\n**a.** ***Respondent\u2019s Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nRespondent alleges that Gambrinus does not qualify as an \"investor\" under the BIT and a \"national of another contracting State\" under the ICSID Convention, on the basis of the following arguments:\n\ni. First, Gambrinus is an empty off-shore entity with no operations. It is owned, controlled and run by Polar, a Venezuelan company, in Venezuela. In accordance with the text of the BIT and the purpose of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal should look at Gambrinus\u2019 economic reality to determine whether it can be considered a foreign investor under the BIT, instead of stopping its analysis at the place of incorporation.101\n\nii. Second, even if the Tribunal would consider that only the incorporation criterion should be followed under both, the BIT and the ICSID Convention, Gambrinus corporate veil should be pierced, on the basis of an occurrence of abuse of process and *fraude de ley.102*\n\nResp. C- Mem., \u00b6 165.\n\nIbid.,\u00b6\u00b6 220-236.\n\n(i) *Gambrinus\u2019 status as an \"investor \" for purposes of the BIT and the ICSID Convention*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Gambrinus does not exist as an economic entity in its own right. Gambrinus is undistinguishable from Inv. Polar as it has no business or economic activities of its own and lacks any meaningful link with Barbados.103 It is registered in Barbados as an \"International Business Company,\" a qualification typically given to shell companies, and its registered addresses correspond to secretarial service providers.104 Instead, it is entirely owned by Inv. Polar, without any true identity and no independent decision-making powers, controlled by the same high ranking executives of Inv. Polar based in Caracas,105 as well as managed by the same directors previously appointed by Inv. Polar, Mr. Grossman and Mr. Gabald\u00f3n.106 Moreover, Polar became involved in Fertinitro for its characteristics as a Venezuelan company and not as a foreign investor107 and it was Inv. Polar, and not Gambrinus, which participated in the settlement negotiations with Pequiven. As such, even after the Share Transfer, Inv. Polar and not Gambrinus continued to be treated as the actual shareholder in Fertinitro.108 Mr. Gabald\u00f3n\u2019s continued to receive his salary from Polar, and Mr. Sucre, the director of the board, approved both, the sale by Inv. Polar, and the purported purchase by Gambrinus.109 All these factors, according to Respondent, prove that Gambrinus is not a foreign investor under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 203-207.\n\nTr. Day 1, [Gouiff\u00e9s] 112:16-25 and 113:1-5 citing Certificate of Incorporation of Gambrinus Corp dated 1 September 2004 (RG-34) and notices of change of address dated 28 Feb 2011 and 22 November 2012 (R-84), Excerpts from secretarial providers, Chancery Chambers and Cidel\u2019s Corporate website *(see* R-7, R-8, respectively). *See also,* Resp.

Guevara of 29 June 2010 (RG-127); Fertinitro\u2019s 2009 Financial Statements (RG-21); and Letter from Pequiven concerning compensation negotiations (RG-74).\n\nResp. PHB (I), \u00b6 31, citing Tr. Day 2, [Gabald\u00f3n] 137:24-25 and 138:1-4.\n\n*The BIT*\n---------\n\n99.\n\nRespondent explains that the reference in Art. 1(d) of the BIT, second sentence, to \"effective control\" reflects Barbados and Venezuela\u2019s intention that economic realities and the economic substance of the entity, be considered when determining the nationality of an investor.110 It further adds that \"an investor incorporated in Barbados but void of any independent economic substance and effectively controlled by a Venezuelan company does not satisfy the nationality requirement.\"111\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 171; *see also infra* \u00b6\u00b6 136-138.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 175.\n\n100.\n\nIn addition, as a matter of international law, the place of incorporation criterion is not sufficient to determine a company\u2019s nationality. Contrary to Claimant\u2019s recount of the *Barcelona Traction* holding, in that case the Court found that, in addition to the place of incorporation, there was a need for some \"permanent and close connection\" between the State of purported nationality and the corporation.112 Moreover, according to Respondent, \"the need for a permanent and close connection has also been recognized by Article 9 of the International Law Commission\u2019s Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, which reflects customary international law.\"113\n\nResp. Rej.,\u00b6 113, citing *Barcelona Traction Barcelona Traction Light and Power Company, Limited,* I.C.J. Reports 1970, 5 February 1970 **(\"Barcelona Traction\")** (RL-20), \u00b6 71.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 114-115.\n\n101.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent suggests that Claimants\u2019 reliance on the *Yukos, Saluka, ADC, and Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* cases to have the Tribunal rely solely on the place of incorporation is misplaced, as those treaties \"contained no control criterion at all\" or in the case of *Tokios, Tokel\u00e9s* the \"applicable provision concerned entities incorporated in third states and its purpose was to extend the scope of protection\" to those states.114\n\nResp. PHB (I), \u00b6 48; *see also infra* \u00b6 135.\n\n*The ICSID Convention*\n----------------------\n\n102.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant\u2019s argument that the definition of investor included in the BIT, instrument of consent, should always be a determining factor over any potential objective definition arising from the Convention. Instead, according to Respondent, such definition should be disregarded in special cases where it proves to be \"unreasonable in light of the ICSID Convention\u2019s object and purpose.\"115\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 121.\n\n103.\n\nVenezuela posits that by considering Gambrinus as a protected investor, the Tribunal would be pennitting Inv. Polar, a Venezuelan corporation, to submit a purely domestic dispute to an ICSID Tribunal, which would be contrary to the ICSID Convention\u2019s object and purpose.116\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 124-125; Tr. Day 1, [Gouiff\u00e9s] 134:16-25 and 135:1-16 relying on Schreuer (RL-6) \u00b6\u00b6 268, 296, 760 (RL-95).\n\n104.\n\nVenezuela considers that Claimant\u2019s reliance on the *Aucoven, Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* and *Rompetrol* tribunals to establish jurisdiction *ratione personae* under the Convention is misplaced. First, the *Aucoven* Tribunal agreed, citing Mr. Broches, that the Parties\u2019 discretion to determine the nationality of companies-investor is limited by the purpose of the Convention.\n\n105.\n\nSecond, the *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* majority recognized that the dispute must satisfy objective requirements of the Convention to fall under the jurisdiction of the tribunal.117 Moreover, in *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s,* the claimant had a real business activity in Lithunia, and the \"test of the siege social\" used in that case would lead to the conclusion that Gambrinus is not an investor.118\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 179-183.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 215-216.\n\n106.\n\nThird, in *Rompetrol,* the claimant was only partially owned by a Romanian national, not entirely owned and the BIT provided for more than only ICSID Arbitration. Therefore, no parallels can be drawn from both cases.119\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 217.\n\n107.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent argues that its proposition is further supported by the *intuitu personae* nature of the contractual arrangements underlying the Fertinitro Project, pursuant to which transfers were subject to restrictive conditions, as the original investors would remain liable for all obligations under the contracts.120 It alleges that \"Polar was chosen to participate in Fertinitro because of its Venezuelan identity\"121 and it was Polar Uno C.A., which signed the JIA and the By-Laws of Fertinitro, subscribed to the original shares, and became one of the Owners of Fertinitro.122 Inv. Polar, as the transferor of its rights under the JIA, bore the risks of Gambrinus\u2019 participation in Fertinitro, and as the guarantor to Gambrinus, Inv. Polar remained jointly and severally liable for all obligations relating to the Project.123 It also retained control over the Claimant.124\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 191-197.\n\nResp. PHB (I), \u00b6 13.\n\nResp. PHB (I), \u00b6 14.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 198-200.\n\n108.\n\nAdditionally, Respondent rejects Claimant\u2019s arguments that the investment was done through a non-Venezuelan entity from the inception, *i.e.* Polar Jos\u00e9, the entity from the Cayman Islands, alleging that Polar Jos\u00e9 was introduced for tax reasons as a \"Special Purpose Subsidiary\" but not as an Owner or investor under the JIA.125\n\nResp. PHB (I), \u00b6 15.\n\n(ii) *Veil-Piercing, Abuse of Process and Fraude a la ley or Fraude de ley*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n109.\n\nIn any case, even if the Tribunal would consider that the incorporation criterion should be followed under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention, Respondent submits that Gambrinus\u2019 corporate veil should be pierced and Gambrinus legal personality should be considered indistinguishable from that of its shareholder, Inv. Polar, a Venezuelan company.\n\n110.\n\nRespondent states that \"the factors considered by arbitral tribunals in piercing the corporate veil are based on the notion of abuse (and in some cases, fraud) and seek to ascertain whether or not abusive corporate structuring or treaty fraud is established. Accordingly,... if there has been a misuse of the legal personality, the corporate veil of the company must be pierced.\"126 Contrary to Claimant\u2019s allegations, \"tribunals have a discretionary power to decide whether it is appropriate to apply this equitable doctrine in cases submitted to their scrutiny.\"127\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 223.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 135.\n\n111.\n\nRespondent contends that the present case merits piercing the corporate veil because Gambrinus is \"an empty vehicle with no genuine connection to Barbados\"128 and Inv. Polar is using its legal personality as \"an opportunistic shield\" to gain access to ICSID jurisdiction.129 Venezuela submits that \"the Share Transfer was a purely artificial transaction. Gambrinus did not disburse a single dollar when it received Fertinitro\u2019s shares from Polar, nor did it suffer any economic detrimental impact as a result of the acquisition.\"130 Moreover, Claimant failed to submit any evidence to support its statement that Gambrinus is a \"corporation of substance.\"131\n\nResp. PHB (II), \u00b6 24.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 227 - 230.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 138.\n\nResp. PHB (II), \u00b6 24.\n\n112.\n\nRespondent further contends that the takeover of Fertinitro was predictable and imminent. By 2008, date of the transfer to Gambrinus, Inv. Polar knew that Venezuela would soon take control of Fertinitro. It was at that point, according to Respondent, that Inv. Polar executed the \"hasty reorganization to transfer, on a purely technical level, its holding to Gambrinus,\"132 which was completed for the sole purpose of obtaining a nationality of convenience and gain access to ICSID arbitration by committing an abuse of process and legal personality.133\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 232.\n\n*Ibid.* \u00b6\u00b6 230-232; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 137-140.\n\n113.\n\nMoreover, by doing so, Gambrinus also incurred a *'fraude de ley\"* under Venezuelan law. As explained by Professor Iribarren, the *fraude de ley* or \"fraud of law\" principle \"is based on the notion that \"an entity may be [a] party to legal dealings which are an indirect breach of the law, in the sense that they achieve a result contrary to the legal framework, although technically complying with the letter of the law.\"134\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 233-234, citing Iribarren (I), \u00b6\u00b6 34-57. *See also, infra,* \u00b6 221 (5).\n\n114.\n\nGambrinus intended to evade (through the share transfer, an otherwise legal means) the jurisdiction of Venezuelan courts over the present dispute, and thereby purposefully elude mandatory rules that dictate the submission of expropriation claims to the Venezuelan courts, as a matter of public policy. These elements are sufficient to conclude that the share transfer constituted a *fraude de ley.135*\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 233-234; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 139, 205-210.\n\n115.\n\nRespondent concludes that the present circumstances justify piercing the corporate veil and that the Tribunal must decline jurisdiction *ratione personae* to prevent the investment treaty arbitration system to be abused.136\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6 148.\n\n**b.** ***Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n(i) *Gambrinus\u2019 status as an \"investor \" for purposes of the BIT and the ICSID Convention*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nNumerous investor-state tribunals have accepted that when incorporation in a state is the sole condition for corporate nationality, no further requirements should be imposed.137 The nationality definition in the BIT applicable to these proceedings is satisfied by reasons of simple incorporation in a contracting state. Since Claimant is incorporated in Barbados, Claimant satisfies the BIT\u2019s corporate nationality definition.138 In addition, as admitted by Respondent, the widely accepted established practice is to find that any agreement on nationality of the BIT satisfies the first prong of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.139\n\nCl.

According to Claimant, the test of incorporation, based on the definition of the BIT, is wholly reasonable and consistent with the object and purpose of the Convention, especially where, as Broches notes, parties have been given \"the widest possible latitude to agree on the meaning of 'nationality' [under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention] and any stipulation of nationality made in connection with... a[n] arbitration clause which is based on a reasonable criterion, should be accepted.\"150 Therefore, the nationality requirement of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is also satisfied.151\n\nId., \u00b6 35, citing A.

Claimant also rejects Respondent\u2019s position that Gambrinus corporate veil should be pierced.\n\n125.\n\nPast tribunals, including the ICJ in *Barcelona Traction,* have held that veil-piercing is reserved for exceptional cases involving injustice or fraudulent use of corporate form, none of which exist in this case.153 Here, Claimant submits, there are no *exceptional factual bases* for claiming that Gambrinus was incorporated for \"fraudulent purposes,\" \"abuse of legal personality,\" \"malfeasance\" or \"evasion of legal requirements or of obligations.\"154 Instead, Gambrinus was formed in 2004, several years after the investment and four years before acquiring the Fertinitro shares, and was engaged in other business activities, such as acquiring shares in Metanol de Oriente S.A. **(\"Metor\").155** Claimant acquired the Fertinitro shares, through a real issuance of equity shares in exchange of Fertinitro shares; it is not an artificial transaction and it was completed at the suggestion of Pequiven, in anticipation of a potential sale of the shares to Pequiven, at a time when no expropriation was made.156\n\nCl.

Rej., \u00b6 36.\n\n126.\n\nClaimant also underlines that from the outset the JIA and Offtake Agreement permitted offshore affiliates to hold Fertinitro shares. Gambrinus\u2019 Fertinitro shares were originally held by Polar Jos\u00e9, another foreign entity from Cayman Islands and Pequiven itself used a BVI entity in the Offtake Agreement.157 The Transfer of Fertinitro shares to Claimant from Inv. Polar \"merely restored the status *quo ante.\"158*\n\nCl. PHB (II), \u00b6 12; Cl. PHB (I), \u00b6 17.\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 37.\n\n127.\n\nThe mere fact that Inv. Polar agreed to \"remain responsible with the transferee Affiliate\" for compliance with the JIA, does not change the separate, independent legal obligations assumed by Gambrinus, as an \"original named party\" to the JIA, according to Claimant.159 Moreover, as explained by Mr. Kaczmarek, the January 2008 acquisition was \"not a 'cost-free' transaction, but a common method of acquiring another company.\"160\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 38.\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 39 citing Kaczmarek (III), \u00b6 13.\n\n128.\n\nAccordingly, there are no legal bases to conclude that the 2008 transfer from Inv. Polar was improper. In any case, as already recognized by the *Tidewater* tribunal, even if the transfer to Claimant was purely motivated by the desire to obtain future treaty benefits, this would not prevent the Tribunal from finding that Gambrinus is a Barbadian company and that it has jurisdiction *ratione personae.*161 Citing also to the *Mobil* tribunal, as well as Prof. Schreuer, Claimant alleges that the weight of authority holds that it is a perfectly legitimate goal to restructure investments with investment treaty protection in mind.162\n\nCl.

However, these elements are absent in this case. First, the transfer of shares occurred to address currency exchange concerns and therefore no \"subjective intent\" can be shown, and, second, the BIT is a fully \"implemented\" treaty in Venezuela, and therefore reliance on the BIT cannot be an evasion of \"a mandatory norm.\"163 As explained by Professor Ayala, \"the option exercised by Gambrinus, that is, one of the two equally valid and effective alternatives under Venezuelan law [namely recourse to the BIT, or to the Venezuelan courts] and which protect investors, cannot be understood to be a violation of Venezuelan public order.\"164\n\nCl.

Rej., \u00b6 33, citing Ayala, \u00b6 202.\n\n130.\n\nFor all these reasons, Claimant alleges that there are no exceptional circumstances that would allow the Tribunal to ignore Claimant\u2019s status under the laws of Barbados and pierce the corporate veil. Accordingly, the conditions for jurisdiction *ratione personae* are met in this case.\n\n(2) **The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nJurisdiction *ratione personae* depends on how \"nationality\" is defined in the ICSID Convention and the BIT, this definition setting the limits to the rights protected which may only be those belonging to a qualifying investor.\n\n132.\n\nAs it has been noted, Contracting States enjoy broad discretion to define corporate nationality under the ICSID Convention. \"[D]efinitions of corporate nationality in national legislation or in treaties providing for ICSID\u2019s jurisdiction are directly relevant to the determination of whether the nationality requirements of Article 25(2)(b) have been met\" and \"[a]ny reasonable determination of the nationality of juridical persons contained in national legislation or in a treaty should be accepted by an ICSID commission or tribunal.\"165\n\nChristoph H. Schreuer *et at., The ICSID Convention. A Commentary,* (2d ed., 2011) (CL-214), p. 287, \u00b6 723.\n\n133.\n\nAs mentioned by other ICSID tribunals, the drafters of the ICSID Convention, in reliance on its consensual nature, preferred giving the Contracting Parties a greater latitude to define themselves such terms as \"legal dispute,\" \"investment,\" \"nationality\" and \"foreign control.\"166 Thus, it has been held that \"the jurisdiction of the Centre depends first and foremost on the consent of the Contracting Parties, who enjoy broad discretion to choose the disputes that they will submit to ICSID.\"167\n\n*Autopista Concessionada de Venezuela, C.A.* v. *Venezuela,* No. ARB/00/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 27 September 2001 ***(\"Aucoven\")*** (CL-33),\u00b697.\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* Decision (CL-32), \u00b6 19.\n\n134.\n\nConsidering the freedom thus left to the Contracting Parties to identify specific criteria to determine the nationality of a juridical person, one may turn to the applicable investment protection treaty to find which are these criteria. According to the BIT, incorporation in Barbados is sufficient to establish nationality of a company.168 Therefore Gambrinus is a \"national of another Contracting State\" and a \"national\" or \"company\" meeting the nationality requirement of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. This is Claimant\u2019s position.\n\n*See supra,* \u00b6 90.\n\n135.\n\nAs previously explained, Respondent contends in opposition that the freedom left by the ICSID Convention to the Contracting Parties is not absolute since it cannot supersede the very purpose of the Convention, which is to promote \"foreign private international investment\" as stated by the Preamble. It adds that Gambrinus is a shell company with no activity whatsoever either in Barbados or in Venezuela, the purpose of the transfer of interest by Inv. Polar in 2008 being to get the benefit of the BIT Barbados-Venezuela.\n\n136.\n\nIn support of its position, Respondent argues that the BIT expressly applies a control criterion to determine corporate nationality in cases where the company is incorporated in one Contracting Party but \"owned or effectively controlled by nationals or companies, of the other Contracting Party.\"169 It relies on Article 1(d), second sentence, of the BIT, according to which\n\nFor the purposes of the Convention referred to in Article 8 \"Company\" shall include any company incorporated or constituted under the law in force in one Contracting Party which is owned or effectively controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.170\n\nResp. PHB (II), \u00b6 22.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 90.\n\n137.\n\nAccording to Respondent, this provision necessarily has a double effect: first, extending jurisdiction to companies incorporated in the Host State but controlled by nationals of the other Contracting Party; second, preventing companies incorporated in one Contracting party but controlled by nationals of the Host State from suing the Host State.171 According to Respondent, the reference to \"effective control\" in the second sentence of Article 1(d) reflects Barbados and Venezuela\u2019s intent for economic realities to be taken into account.172\n\nResp. PHB (I), \u00b6 48. Resp. PHB (II), \u00b6\u00b6 22 -23.\n\nResp. C.-Mem.,\u00b6 171.\n\n138.\n\nAlways according to Respondent, the provision would apply also to the present case with the effect of excluding that Gambrinus, being owned or effectively controlled by a Venezuelan entity, is eligible as a \"Company\" for purposes of the ICSID Convention under Article 8 of the BIT. Respondent relies on the treaty interpretation criteria codified in the VCLT, specifically Article 31(1) according to which the treaty provision should be interpreted *\"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\"173* In this respect, an analysis of the purpose and object of the BIT, as described in the preamble confirms that the Tribunal should look at economic realities, since the BIT aims to provide protections to foreign and not to domestic investors.174\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 168-171; Resp. Rej.\u00b6\u00b6 98-102.\n\nResp. C-Mem, \u00b6\u00b6 173-74.; Resp. Rej. \u00b6 101.\n\n139.\n\nThe Tribunal does not share Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the second sentence of Article 1(d) of the BIT. It considers that this provision mirrors Article 25(2)(b), second part, of the ICSID Convention according to which the nationality requirement is satisfied also in case of a company incorporated in the Contracting State party to the dispute if such company is subject to foreign control. As indicated by the wording used for the definition of \"Company\" under Article 1(d), second sentence, of the BIT, the intent of the Contracting Parties was to expand such definition to include \"any company incorporated or constituted under the law in force in one Contracting Party which is owned or effectively controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.\" The \"expansive\" effect of Article 1(d), second sentence, is the same as it is provided by Article 25(2)(b), second part, of the ICSID Convention.\n\n140.\n\nRespondent\u2019s interpretation is at odds with the *\"ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty in their context\"* under the VCLT and with the Contracting Parties\u2019 intention to give an expansive effect to this provision, as made manifest by the wording adopted. According to this interpretation, the provision \"includes\" the situation that Respondent seeks instead to exclude. When applied to the case of Gambrinus, the effect of the provision would not be to \"exclude\" Gambrinus, from the scope of Article 8 of the BIT, but rather to consider that Gambrinus, being a company incorporated or constituted under the law in force in one Contracting Party, namely Barbados, would be eligible for dispute settlement purposes to bring a claim against Barbados under the BIT as a company \"owned or effectively controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party,\" *i.e.* controlled by Inv. Polar, a Venezuelan company.\n\n141.\n\nRespondent further contends that failing application of the above provision to exclude that Gambrinus meet the nationality requirement under the ICSID Convention and the BIT, Gambrinus\u2019 corporate veil should be pierced since \"Polar\u2019s use of Gambrinus\u2019 legal personality is a prime example of abuse of personality.\"175 Respondent relies on the ICJ\u2019s *Barcelona Traction* case as recognising that the act of piercing the corporate veil is part of the international customary law \"to prevent the misuse of the privilege of legal personality.\"176\n\nRespondent C-Mem., \u00b6 220.\n\n*Ibid.,\u00b6* 221.\n\n142.\n\nThe Tribunal notes initially that *Barcelona Traction's* ruling concerns diplomatic protection, a context which is not the one of investment protection regulated by the ICSID Convention and the BIT. It notes further that piercing the corporate veil may only apply in exceptional circumstances, in case where \"fraud\" or \"malfeasance\" is clearly established, this being the type of conduct considered by *Barcelona Traction* as justifying a veilpiercing. Respondent has not shown that Claimant has used its status as a Barbadian entity, known to and accepted by Respondent, to perpetrate fraud or engage in malfeasance. As it has been noted, there is nothing wrong for a prudent investor \"to organise its investment in a way that affords maximum protection under existing treaties, usually by establishing a company in a State that... accepts incorporation as a basis for corporate nationality.\"177\n\nSchreuer\u2019s *Guide to Nationality Planning,* Global Arbitration Review, May 11, 2012, p. 1 (CL-156).\n\n143.\n\nThere is also no basis for Respondent\u2019s claim that by entering into the Share Transfer Agreement with Inv. Polar, Claimant committed a \"*fraude a la ley\"* under Venezuelan law since the aim of the transaction was to avoid the application of mandatory Venezuelan laws, specifically the expropriation law, and to evade the exclusive jurisdiction of Venezuelan courts. As it has been correctly mentioned, the option to make recourse to the BIT protection was equally valid under Venezuelan law, the BIT being part of this law, so that its choice cannot be understood as a violation of Venezuelan public order.178 The only basis for establishing jurisdiction *ratione personae* in this case is the conformity of Claimant\u2019s claim with the requirements of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, not with mandatory rules of the local law.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 129.\n\n144.\n\nIn the exercise of its functions the Tribunal is guided by the terms in which the Contracting Parties to the BIT have agreed to establish its jurisdiction. According to the Tribunal\u2019s interpretation, the BIT only requires that Claimant be constituted under the laws of one of the Contracting Parties. As a company incorporated or constituted in Barbados, one of the BIT\u2019s Contracting Parties, Gambrinus satisfies the jurisdiction *ratione personae.*\n\n145.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s finding of jurisdiction *ratione personae* under the BIT is not dispositive of all issues of jurisdiction. It leaves open the question whether in the particular case the ICSID Convention is used for a purpose for which clearly it was not intended by permitting that a purely domestic dispute be internationalized into a treaty investment dispute in violation of the \"outer limits\" of that Convention.179\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 93. To use the words of another tribunal, \"[t]he tribunal has to ensure that the ICSID mechanism does not protect investments that it was not designed for to protect, because they are in essence domestic investments disguised as international investments for the sole purpose of access to this mechanism.\" *Phoenix Action, Ltd v. Czech Republic,* Award, 15 April 2009 ***(\"Phoenix***\") (RL-11), \u00b6 144.\n\n146.\n\nContrary to Claimant\u2019s suggestion that only the BIT is relevant for the purposes of determining jurisdiction *ratione paersonae,* cases on which it relies confirm the need to consider in addition whether jurisdiction in the particular case is consistent with the very purpose of the ICSID Convention. Thus, the tribunal in *Aucoven,* referring to the discretion left to the parties by the framers of the Convention in defining nationality, held:\n\nit goes without saying, however [...] that this discretion is not unlimited and cannot be exercised to the point of being clearly inconsistent with the purposes of the Convention.180\n\nLikewise, the majority of the tribunal in the *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* case held:\n\nTribunals shall exercise jurisdiction over all disputes that fall within the scope of the Contracting Parties\u2019 consent as long as the dispute satisfies the objective requirements set forth in Article 25 of the Convention.181\n\n*Aucoven* (CL-33), \u00b6 98.\n\n*Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* Decision (CL-32), \u00b6 19.\n\n147.\n\nUnless jurisdiction is to be excluded on any other ground, it shall therefore be necessary to examine in the context of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* whether Gambrinus owns an \"investment\" in Venezuela according to the ICSID Convention and the BIT and, if so, whether Gambrinus is a shell company having made no contribution, as alleged by Respondent.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Temporis***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties\u2019 Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* because Inv. Polar transferred it shares to Gambrinus with the purpose of gaining access to ICSID \"at a time when the dispute had already arisen, or was at the very least reasonably foreseeable.\"182 Claimant answers, in turn, that the Share-Transfer responded to business considerations and that Respondent\u2019s challenge to the 2008 Share Transfer as an abuse of rights is factually unsupported.183\n\nResp.

At the time of the 2008 Share Transfer, Fertinitro had already been affected by these and other regulatory measures which reflected the government\u2019s increased control over food security industries.187\n\nResp.

PHB (II), \u00b6 12, quoting Wikileaks Cable from US Embassy in Caracas to Washington, RE: New Petrochemicals Law, 27 August 2009 (R-94). As a matter of fact, the quote from the cable puts it differently:  \n... Pequiven began diverting a higher percentage of FertiNitro\u2019s production to the domestic market in 2006. This was followed by a 2007 government regulation mandating that urea be supplied first to the domestic market. Since then Pequiven has run the Jose facility itself; Koch pulled its own people out in 2007. (C) Koch has received verbal assurances from Pequiven that the project would not be affected by the new petrochemical legislation. In the event of nationalization, however, Koch has prepared by registering its FertiNitro affiliate in Switzerland to give it access to the Swiss Bilateral Investment Treaty. A Koch representative added that Pequiven\u2019s management of the facility could be termed a \"creeping expropriation\" given that it no longer consults with the FertiNitro Board or abides by other contract provisions.\n\n153.\n\nVenezuela also submits that, unlike what Claimant alleges, whether Gambrinus decided or not to bring a positive legal claim on the basis of the Urea Decree is irrelevant to determine if there is a dispute. For a dispute to exist, the applicable test is whether at the time of the purported transfer \"a conflict of legal views or interests existed.\"192\n\nResp. PHB (II), \u00b6\u00b6 9-11.\n\n154.\n\nAccordingly, the purported 2008 Share Transfer was made after the dispute had arisen, and there can be no jurisdiction over Gambrinus.\n\n155.\n\nRelying on the *Pac Rim* and *Tidewater* cases, Respondent further submits that, in any case, an abuse of rights can also occur when the dispute, albeit not yet in existence, was reasonably foreseeable.193 Venezuela contends that the escalation of regulatory and legislative measures in 2007, as well as repeated public and private warnings at the time of the purported 2008 Share Transfer, made the expropriation obvious and inevitable (at the very least), and therefore beyond the reasonably foreseeable standard, for the following reasons:\n\nResp.

PHB (II), \u00b6 14.\n\n156.\n\nFirst, the 2007 legal climate unequivocally pointed to Fertinitro\u2019s nationalisation:\n\n\u25a0 With Venezuela\u2019s National Development Plan to \"take control\" of strategic production activities and related measures in the background, it was \"imminent and foreseeable\" that, as part of the government policy, Venezuela would take control of Fertinitro\u2019s assets.194\n\n\u25a0 The framework for Fertinitro\u2019s expropriation had already been established.195 Relying on Dr. Irribaren\u2019s Opinion, Respondent alleges that in Venezuela all expropriation process have three distinct phases: the first phase begins when the legislative body enacts a legal act declaring that the assets and activities are of \"public interest,\" a second administrative phase follows in which the executive body declares the expropriation; and third, a judicial phase consisting of the payment of compensation to the affected parties and the transfer of title of the assets.196\n\nIn this instance, the pre-expropriatory phase began in February 2007 with the enactment of the Hoarding Law. This law declared that all products necessary for the production and manufacturing of food were public and of social interest. It continued with the issuance of the Urea Decree and Decree 5835 and the enactment of the Draft Petrochemical Organic Law, that would require Fetinitro\u2019s acquisition of at least 51% of the shares, as well as other measures in the field of food security followed during the first quarter of 2007. Subsequent to this, Inv. Polar transferred its interest to Gambrinus in 2008.\n\n\u25a0 Claimant could not ignore the Orinoco Belt nationalisations, where the state was acquiring a majority interest.\n\nResp.

This lead to an article by Mr. Gabald\u00f3n recommending limitations on the draft Petrochemical Law.200 In addition, the alleged assurances that there would be no nationalization arguably provided by Pequiven\u2019s external legal counsel, evidenced on a hand written note, further confirm that this was a real concern and a point of discussion.201\n\nResp.

Polar equity interest was to enable Gambrinus to access international arbitration by bringing a pre-existing or reasonably foreseeable dispute as an international dispute under the BIT. This should lead the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction over the present proceedings.\n\n**b.** ***Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nAccording to Claimant, Respondent\u2019s assertion that the transfer of Fertinitro shares to Claimant was motivated by an imminent expropriation is unfounded. Instead, Claimant asserts, it was based on business considerations for currency-related reasons to receive U.S. dollars in anticipation of Pequiven\u2019s purchase of Inv. Polar\u2019s interests in Fertinitro.204 Moreover, Pequiven\u2019s own lawyer, Mr. Simon Guevara, was of the opinion that there was a reasonable risk that a dividend to be paid to a shareholder located in Venezuela could be subject to currency restrictions.205\n\nCl.

Polar\u2019s interests in another mixed company, Metor.206 In reliance of its witness, Mr. Gabald\u00f3n, Claimant stated that during those negotiations:\n\nMr. Garcia [a Pequiven representative] suggested that the best way for Inv. Polar to receive U.S. dollars for its shares was for Inv. Polar to transfer its interest in Metor to an 'off-shore' entity, because such a transfer would obviate the need for Pequiven to obtain approval of the Central Bank of Venezuela and Ministry of the Popular Power for Energy and Oil to make foreign currency payments to a domestic corporation.\n\nBased on this suggestion, Inv. Polar transferred its interest in Metor to Claimant. Inv. Polar then also followed the same practice when it transferred its Fertinitro shares to Claimant, in anticipation of another acquisition by Pequiven.207\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 8-11 citing to R.

According to Claimant, in December 2007, Pequiven\u2019s counsel stated that the buy-out was on a \"fast track\" set for \"early next year (1st Qtr)208 and Pequiven was ostensibly still working with the lenders at that time toward the completion of the transaction. \"Thus, Fertinitro was also still considering dollar-denominated dividend payments in January 2008, which provided an additional impetus for Inv.

Instead, the notion of \"pre-existing dispute\" must be \"tied to the specific measures that form the Claimant\u2019s cause of action in the arbitration.\"212 Neither Inv. Polar nor Gambrinus made a legal claim concerning the implementation of the Urea Decree and Resolution, which would be necessary for a dispute to exist.213 Claimant\u2019s claim rests on the October 2010 Expropriation Decree alone not the Urea Decree or Resolution.214\n\nCl.

Instead, according to Claimants, Respondent expressly disclaimed any intention to expropriate Fertinitro. First, Mr. Toro provided assurances that shareholders\u2019 rights would be respected and that the Urea Decree would not negatively impact Fertinitro\u2019s operations.224 Second, Respondent informed Claimant and the other shareholders of Fertinitro\u2019s interest in a buy-out through a negotiated process and in a December 2007 meeting, Mr. Miguel Zaldivar, Pequiven\u2019s counsel, expressly told the investors that \"the Government of Venezuela was not nationalizing Fertinitro.\"225 Third, correspondence from a Koch representative shows that, sometime in January 2007, Mr Toro stated that \"all shareholders rights and agreements will be respected.\"226 Thus, at least on three occasions, January, February and December 2007, Respondent represented that there would be no expropriation.227 Finally, the 2008 acquisition occurred in an atmosphere of continued negotiations between Fertinitro and the private shareholders for an amicable buy-out.228\n\nCl.

Rej., \u00b6 154.\n\nIbid., \u00b6 155.\n\n177.\n\nRespondent lists a series of facts that in its opinion indicate that the conditions for a dispute to have arisen existed in January 2008, when Inv. Polar transferred to Gambrinus its interest in Fertinitro.236 According to Respondent, the transfer to Gambrinus was made after the dispute had started for the purpose of resolving the same through an international regime that would not have been available to Inv. Polar.237\n\n*Ibid.,\u00b6* 156.\n\nResp.

Polar\u2019s transfer of its interest in Fertinitro to Gambrinus, a Barbadian company, or if in any case the dispute was foreseeable thereby enabling Claimant to have access to this Tribunal by an abuse of process.\n\n180.\n\nIn order to substantiate the position that the dispute pre-dated the transfer of interest from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus, Respondent refers to a series of legislative and regulatory measures reflecting Venezuela\u2019s policy to ensure stable domestic food production and food security.241 Among such measures, the National Development Plan for the Economic and Social Development of the National for the period 2007-2013 were announced in January 2007, declaring the State\u2019s maintenance of \"full control of production activities which are of strategic value for the development of the country.\"242\n\n*See also* description of selective legislative measures *supra* Section IV.

C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 96-97.\n\n181.\n\nA few days later, on 21 February 2007, the Hoarding Law was published, declaring the public utility and social interest of goods needed for food production activities and allowing the Government to initiate expropriatory actions for reasons of food security and sovereignty.243 The Urea Decree followed on 26 February 2007, stating that food production is \"an essential element of national security and sovereignty\" and declaring nitrogenous fertilizers and products required for their production to be primarily for the local market and that their prices would be regulated by ministerial resolutions. Such resolution was issued on 2 May 2007 (the Urea Resolution), fixing the price at which Pequiven was entitled to buy urea in order to meet domestic demand from any domestic producers, including Fertinitro.244\n\nIbid.,\u00b6\u00b6 102-103.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 105-107.\n\n182.\n\nOther legislative measures were contemplated regarding the petrochemical industry. A draft of Petrochemical Organic Law was circulated around April 2007 providing that Pequiven would have to hold a majority equity participation in all mixed petrochemical companies (including Fertinitro),245 the intent being to pass the Law before the end of 2007.246 On 23 September 2007, the new Socialist Petrochemical Revolutionary Plan was released declaring the objective of turning Venezuela into a world petrochemical power.\n\n*Ibid.,\u00b6\u00b6* 114-115.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 119.\n\n183.\n\nOn 28 January 2008, Decree 5835 was issued \"declaring numerous products including ammonia and urea, to be of a public utility\" and stating that \"for safety reasons and food sovereignty and without further formality... the government might initiate expropriation proceedings.\"247\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 122, referring to Gabald\u00f3n (I), \u00b6 50.\n\n184.\n\nRespondent provided in its Opening Statement at the hearing of 10 March 2014, a summary of the measures that could be considered potential signals of expropriation248:\n\nRespondent\u2019s Opening Statement, Hearing of 10 March 2014, para. 2.3.5 \"Overview of measures pointing to expropriation of Fertinitro.\"\n\n185.\n\nAccording to Respondent, this escalation of regulatory and legislative interventions throughout 2007 could not but make a sophisticated and prudent business actor as the Polar Group realise \"that the expropriation of Fertinitro was inevitable\"249 and that the dispute in that regard, if not already in existence, was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the purported Share Transfer.250 The more so since, according to Respondent, under Venezuelan expropriation law the first step in the expropriatory process is the declaration of \"various products, including fertilizers, to be of public and social interest,\" such declaration having intervened in February 2007 with the Hoarding Law.251\n\nResp.

However, the available evidence does not point to just one direction, namely the serious threat of imminent expropriation of Fertinitro, as contended by Respondent.\n\n187.\n\nSome of these measures, such as the Urea Decree and Regulation, had limited effects on Fertinitro\u2019s business activity,252 the latter remaining \"capable of servicing its debt obligations and generating profits.\"253 The Urea Decree did not even lead to a declaration of default by Fertinitro under the financing documentation only 15% of its output being estimated to be required to comply with that Decree.254As stated by Claimant, after studying the effect of the Urea Decree for a year, on 15 October 2008 \"Fitch Ratings upgraded Fertinitro\u2019s credit rating.\"255 The valuation so given of Fertinitro\u2019s business activity by a prominent ratings agency may be hardly reconciled with the imminent threat of an expropriation.\n\nAs explained by Mr. Gabald\u00f3n (II), \u00b6\u00b6 74, 93-94, 104, 105 and recognized by Mr. Toro, Pequiven\u2019s representative and the Company\u2019s President, at Fertinitro Board Meeting of May 24,2007: \"based on estimates of urea consumption, Pequiven\u2019s own production, and the fact that Pequiven\u2019s new fertilizer plant should be ready within three years, the effect on Fertinitro of the requirement [to supply] urea at regulated price[s] should be very reasonable.\" (RG-70, p. 2).\n\nResp.

In a communication of 18 January 2007, Mr. Parra, one of Fertinitro Directors, advised Mr. Gabald\u00f3n regarding comments made by Mr. Toro in a previous Board Meeting on plans and intentions for Fertinitro\u2019s future. The essence and key points of Mr. Toro\u2019s communication were:\n\n\u25a0 Time has run out and Pequiven must take control of the Offtake and the Business;\n\n\u25a0 FertiNitro must be run by the Venezuela State;\n\n\u25a0 Fertilizer is vital to the country\u2019s needs;\n\n\u25a0 All this is in line with the philosophies of the Venezuelan government and its law;\n\n\u25a0 Pequiven will be bringing specific proposals for the consideration of all the shareholders;\n\n\u25a0 The discussions will be open, but time is limited;\n\n\u25a0 Pequiven recognizes that the debt must be paid off-it is internally studying the process to achieve this end;\n\n\u25a0 Pequiven would like to have all shareholders continue to participate-nevertheless, one shareholder has already offered its shares for sale, and this knowledge will be made public shortly;\n\n\u25a0 All shareholders\u2019 rights and agreements will be respected.256\n\nE-mail for T.

He added that Pequiven would soon be holding individual talks with the shareholders to try to reach an amicable agreement on the matter.257\n\nMinutes of Board of Directors Meetings No. 78 (RG-68); *see also, supra* \u00b6 52.\n\n190.\n\nFollowing Fertinitro\u2019s management favourable consideration, since October 2006 Pequiven had started negotiating the purchase of one or more of the other shareholders\u2019 interest in Fertinitro.258 Therefore, despite the legislative measures contemplated or already enacted that, according to Respondent, had an impact on Fertinitro\u2019s future business prospects, in February 2007 there was no threat of expropriation but rather a negotiation program in order for Pequiven to acquire the control of Fertinitro based on \"an amicable agreement\" in the pursuance of which \"existing agreements\" would be honored.259\n\nBoard of Directors of Fertinitro dated 17 October 2006 (R-55), p. 5)\n\nMinutes of the Board of Directors Meetings No. 78 (RG-68).\n\n191.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the shareholders other than Pequiven, including Inv. Polar, showed interest in Pequiven\u2019s proposal to buy their shares in Fertinitro.260 As reminded by Mr. Toro, at that time, Polar had sold to Pequiven its interest in another mixed company with the latter, Metor.261 Negotiations followed for the buy-out of Fertinitro.\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 125.\n\nToro (I), \u00b6 39. Reference to the Metor\u2019s sale is in Cl. Rej., \u00b6 7(d); Cl. PHB (I), \u00b6 18 and n. 43; Cl. PHB (II), \u00b6 9.\n\n192.\n\nIn November 2007, a draft MOU was circulated setting forth the general terms of a transaction pursuant to which each of Koch, LAIF, Snamprogetti and Polar would have transferred their respective shares in Fertinitro to Pequiven for an aggregate purchase price indicated by the draft of USD 1,210,000,000.00 \"less the outstanding balance of principal and accrued interest on Fertinitro\u2019s existing bank and bond financing as of the Closing Date... plus the Excess Cash.\"262\n\nGabald\u00f3n (I), \u00b6 54; Draft Memorandum of Understanding (2007) (RG-36).\n\n193.\n\nThe Parties disagree on the reasons for the failure to reach a final agreement on the buy-out of Fertinitro\u2019s shares by Pequiven. According to Respondent, the price indicated in the draft MOU was \"far exceeding a reasonable valuation of the plant\" and therefore, the negotiations were interrupted.263 According to Mr. Gabald\u00f3n, a sale of shares to Pequiven remained a real possibility throughout much of 2008, Pequiven \"seeking to raise the necessary funds to complete the buyout,\" which became too difficult for it \"due to the worldwide economic crisis that began in September 2008.\"264\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6 126. According to Mr. Toro, as a result \"Pequiven decided to suspend the idea of acquiring the Fertinitro shares,\" Toro (I), \u00b6 42.\n\nGabald\u00f3n (I), \u00b6\u00b6 66-67; Gabald\u00f3n (II), \u00b6\u00b6 79-81.\n\n194.\n\nBy an e-mail of 30 September 2008 Mr. Miguel Zaldivar, counsel for Pequiven at Hogan & Hartson, sent the following message to the representatives of Fertinitro\u2019s shareholders:\n\nAt the request of some of the shareholders, the Citibank-Hogan & Hartson team working with Pequiven invite you to participate in a meeting in Miami (at noon in our offices, address is below) on Monday October 6 at which we will make a presentation of a proposed plan involving the transfer of your interest in FertiNitro and related financing issues. Essentially, some of the shareholders want to know the details of the finance plan, a step by step analysis of how it will be implemented, attendant legal and financial risks, etc. Please confirm whether you will be in attendance. Thanks and best regards, Miguel.265\n\nEmail Exchange among Miguel Zaldivar, Jr. (Partner, Hogan & Hartson LLP) and the Fertinitro Shareholders discussing the potential sale of Fertinitro shares in Pequiven, 2 September 20 September 2008 (RG-115).\n\n195.\n\nThe same document refers in its body to previous communications among the parties to the proposed transaction confirming Claimant\u2019s position that after December 2007 \"Pequiven was ostensibly still working toward the completion of the transaction.\"266 Evidence in the file shows that on 6 October 2008, following the above invitation, Mr. Grossmann, a director of Inv. Polar, attended a meeting with Hogan & Hartson, counsel for Pequiven, and Citibank in Miami \"to finalize issues related to the financing of the transaction.\"267\n\nCl. Rej., \u00b6 12.\n\nGabald\u00f3n (II), \u00b6 80.\n\n196.\n\nBased on the foregoing, it is the Tribunal\u2019s view that at the time of the purported Share Transfer to Gambrinus, \"expropriation\" of Fertinitro was not only far from being in existence but neither \"reasonably foreseeable\" or \"highly probable,\" as alleged by Respondent.268 There would have been no need for Pequiven to continue to negotiate the terms of a complex transaction as the one related to the Fertinitro\u2019s buy-out, if Respondent had plans of expropriating Fertinitro in January 2008.\n\nIt is to be noted that Pequiven had excluded on various occasions that Fertinitro was under threat of expropriation. *See* Cl. Rej.,\u00b6 24.\n\n197.\n\nMore may be said on the subject. Respondent\u2019s claim -relying on the *Phoenix* holding- that the Urea Decree and Regulation had \"cause[d] damages to\" Fertinitro so that a \"dispute... had already arisen\" in January 2008 making Gambrinus\u2019 acquisition an \"abuse of right,\"269 is to be rejected. As previously mentioned and as recognized also by Pequiven, the effects on Fertinitro\u2019s business of the Urea Decree and Regulation were minimal, Fitch having upgraded again Fertinitro\u2019s rating in October 2008.270. Even accepting the holding of other tribunals according to which to consider that a dispute exists it is sufficient that it be \"reasonably foreseeable\"271 or \"highly probable,\"272 it is a fact that in January 2008 there was no \"dispute\" which might have had a negative impact on Fertinitro\u2019s business activities in the near future.\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 151-152.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 187.\n\n*Tidewater, supra,* \u00b6 155.\n\n*Pac Rim, ibid.*\n\n198.\n\nUnder general international law, a dispute means \"a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests between parties.\"273 ICSID tribunals have adopted similar description of a dispute, holding that in order for a dispute to exist it must be susceptible of being stated in terms of a concrete claim.274 No such \"disagreement\" or \"conflict of legal opinions or of interests\" had emerged in January 2008, even if only potentially, regarding Fertinitro and its expropriation.\n\n*Mavrommatis Palestine Concessions (Greece v.

Except to the extent relevant for other aspects of the case, this determination dispenses the Tribunal with inquiring into the reasons underlying the Share Transfer of January 2008, a subject on which the Parties disagree.275\n\n*See supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 159-163.\n\n**D. The Tribunal\u2019s Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Materiae***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties\u2019 positions**\n------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant cannot be considered to have made an investment under the objective criteria of the ICSID Convention Article 25.276 In addition, the applicable BIT definition is not met \"because Gambrinus never made an active contribution, nor did it ever commit any resources for the Fertinitro shares it purportedly acquired.\"277 Moreover, since Gambrinus alleged \"investment\" was made in violation of Venezuelan laws, the dispute arising from it falls outside the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.278 Claimant, in turn, rebuts Respondent\u2019s allegation, stating that Gambrinus held at all material times 10% of the outstanding shares in Fertinitro, which is sufficient to satisfy the terms of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. The *Salini* test, including the criteria for contribution and risk, does not establish jurisdictional requirements, which are, in any event, met in this case.279\n\nResp.

PHB (II), \u00b6\u00b6 25-26.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 *27.*\n\n(i) *The validity of the Share Transfer from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n202.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the Share Transfer from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus involved \"a technical arrangement involving a share issue and the creation and then cancellation of a hypothetical debt with no detriment to Gambrinus.\"282 Such transfer was not in accordance with the terms of the transfer restrictions of the Fertinitro Founding Agreements and therefore Gambrinus has no standing before this Tribunal because it never received title to the shares in Fertinitro.\n\nResp. PHB (I), \u00b6 7.\n\n1. The modalities of the Share Transfer and alleged applicable restrictions under the Founding Agreements\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nIn recognition of the *intuitu personae* nature of the JIA and the Fertinitro Companies Bylaws, these documents contained detailed restrictions on the transfer of their interests.\n\n204.\n\nSections 6(2) and 6(7) of the JIA contain the required conditions for the disposition of interests in Fertinitro. Section 6.2 included two different set of regimes. One for share-transfer to third parties (i.e. any party that is not an Owner or an affiliate of an Owner as defined in the JIA) and another one for transfer \"by an Owner to an Affiliate of such Owner.\"\n\n205.\n\nIn accordance with Section 6(2) for transfers to an Affiliate, an Owner would have to comply with *inter alia* the following: (i) provide 30 day written notice of the transfer to Fertinitro and the other Owners; (ii) repurchase the shares transferred to the affiliate if the affiliate ceases to be an affiliate of the Owner; (iii) ensure that the transferring Owner remains responsible with the transferee Affiliate for compliance with all the obligations of the transferring Owner under the Agreement; and (iv) comply with the conditions of 6(7), which were applicable to any type of transfer.283\n\nResp. Submission, \u00b6 12.\n\n206.\n\nIn accordance with Section 6(7), all transfers of participating interest in Fertinitro shall be made \"exclusively for cash or cash equivalent.\"\n\n207.\n\nRespondent argues that these transfer requirements -as the other provisions of the JIA-were specifically chosen among sophisticated commercial entities, with extensive knowledge and experience of concluding commercial contracts of this type and complexity.284\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* \u00b6 9.\n\n208.\n\nIn addition, Articles 11 to 15 of the By-Laws of Fertinitro Oriente S.A. contain a mirror validity requirement that all transfers be made \"in cash or cash equivalent to the exclusion of any other forms of consideration,\" and that any non-compliant disposition of interests would be null and void.285\n\nBy-Laws of Fertinitro Oriente S.A. (RG-11), Art. 14; *See* Resp. Submission, \u00b6 14.\n\n209.\n\nAccording to Respondent, it is undisputed that Gambrinus did not make a payment in \"cash or cash equivalent.\" Instead, Inv. Polar and Gambrinus devised a \"share for share transaction.\"286\n\nResp. Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 23-25; 32-33.\n\n210.\n\nThis was accomplished first, through the 21 January 2008 notice, by which Inv. Polar informed the other Owners of the purported Share-Transfer and \"urgently\" requested that they waive the 30-day notice period required under Section 6.2.2(a) of the JIA and 12(b) of the By-Laws.287 Respondent alleges that Claimant failed to explain the urgency of the request.288\n\n*Ibid.,\u00b6\u00b6* 19-20.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 20, referring to Tr. Day 2, [Goiffes/Gabald\u00f3n] 130:21-25.\n\n211.\n\nThe second step was the execution of the 24 January 2008 Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which Gambrinus would pay Inv. Polar\u2019s USD eighty million one hundred (USD 80,000,100.00) for Inv. Polar\u2019s 10% equity interest in Fertinitro.289 The one and half page was not circulated to the other Owners.290 \"[W]hile the shares were stated to have already been transferred, payment would only take place at an undetermined future date,\" following the \"granting\" of the document.291\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 22, referring to the Share Purchase Agreement, *Contrato de Compraventa de Acciones,* between Inv. Polar S.A. and Gambrinus Corp, dated 24 January 2014 (RG-37), Clause Three.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* referencing the Share Purchase Agreement (RG-37), \u00b6 5.\n\n212.\n\nThird, on 15 February 2008, Gambrinus and Inv. Polar subscribed a Common Share Subscription Agreement.292 Under this agreement, Gambrinus issued further shares in itself to Inv. Polar for USD eighty million one hundred (USD 80,000,100.00). The amount owed by Inv. Polar to Gambrinus for the subscription of those new shares was set off against the identical sum that Gambrinus owed to Inv. Polar under the Share Purchase Agreement.293\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 23, referencing the Share Subscription Agreement dated 15 February 2008 (RG-120).\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 23, referencing Gambrinus Corp Resolution dated 15 February 2008 (RG-119).\n\n213.\n\nRespondent further alleges that under this arrangement, no funds were transferred from Gambrinus to Inv. Polar. Similarly, the issuance of new shares could not be considered as a payment in cash or having been made through a \"cash equivalent.\" This was expressly recognized by Claimant during the hearing.294 Respondent asserts that:\n\n[I]t is generally accepted that a cash equivalent is a fully liquid asset, that is one of that is readily convertible into cash on a short-term basis... Gambrinus is not traded publicly, and as such there is no market for the trade of its shares and no way in which their value can be quickly and precisely defined. Shares in Gambrinus could therefore not constitute a cash equivalent as they are not an immediately realizable liquid asset.295\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 24, 34-35, citing Tr. Day 1, [Chairman/Nelson] 74:9-19.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 36. Respondent further relies \"[b]y way of illustration\" on \"the International Financial Reporting Standard (IFRS) 7, a global accounting standard adopted by Venezuela, which considers in detail the meaning of the term \"cash equivalents.\" : *ibid.,\u00b6* 37. This is highly contested by Claimant *(see infra,* n. 330)).\n\n214.\n\nRespondent claims that it did not realize the share-for-share nature of this transaction until it read Claimant\u2019s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.296\n\nResp. Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 28, 51.\n\n2. Gambrinus\u2019 alleged acquisition of the Fertinitro shares\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nPursuant to Section 6.1. of the JIA, all transfers that did not comply with all required conditions, would be null and void, and have no force or effect.297 On this basis, the consequence of Inv. Polar\u2019s non-compliance with the terms of the JIA and By-laws is that the purported transfer is *ipso iure* null and void, which pursuant to Venezuelan law, has the same effect as non-existence.298\n\nJIA (C-6).\n\nResp. Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 30-31, 44 citing Legal Opinion of Dr. G. Montoya, \u00b6 59.\n\n216.\n\nRespondent also rejects Claimant\u2019s allegations that the aforementioned transfer restrictions do not apply to inter-affiliate transactions, as is the case between Inv. Polar and Gambrinus. A transfer to an Affiliate constitutes a \"Permitted Disposition\" under Section 6.2 of JIA, which expressly requires that Section 6.7 be complied with. Respondent further contends that the heading of Section 6.7 unequivocally states that it applies to all transfers. The same reasoning applies to Art. 14 of the By-Laws.299\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 46-49.\n\n217.\n\nAccordingly, the Share Transfer never materialized; Gambrinus never acquired ownership of the shares in Fertinitro and it never became an Owner under the terms of the JIA, as further confirmed by Dr. Garcia Montoya, Respondent\u2019s appointed legal-expert. As a result, it made no protected investment under the BIT and cannot be subject to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.300\n\n*Ibid., \u00b6 62.*\n\n(ii) *Gambrinus\u2019 alleged investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n218.\n\nAccording to Respondent, in this case there is no investment either under the ICSID Convention, or under Article 1(a) of the BIT.\n\n219.\n\nRespondent rejects Claimant\u2019s contention that satisfying the requirements of the BIT is sufficient to satisfy Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.301 Citing for support to several ICSID decisions and commentators, Respondent asserts that an investment must pass a \"dual jurisdictional test.\"302\n\nResp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 251-263.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 253 and cases cited in n. 291.\n\n220.\n\nRespondent posits that the existence of objective criteria for purposes of determining if there is an \"investment\" under the Convention, and the use of the *\"Salini* criteria,\" have been widely accepted by ICSID tribunals and cannot be simply dismissed, as Claimant\u2019s attempt to suggest.303 Recent cases such as *Caratube, Quiborax, KT Asia* and *Malicorp* have recognized that the mere holding of shares is \"insufficient\" for an investment to be found to exist.304\n\nResp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 159-160; *see also,* Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 264-269; Resp. PHB (II), \u00b6 32.\n\nResp. PHB (II), \u00b6 32; *see also,* Resp. C-Mem., \u00b6\u00b6 251-263; Resp. Rej., \u00b6\u00b6 169-179.\n\n221.\n\nFirst, considering the *Salini* criteria, as expanded by subsequent case law, Claimant\u2019s alleged investment does not meet the jurisdictional requirement under the ICSID Convention because:\n\n1. *There is no substantial contribution in money or other assets, i.e. \"a commitment of resources\" from Gambrinus.* An investment must involve from the outset a substantial trans-border flow of capital from the purported investor to the host state *(i.e.* the contribution).305 Gambrinus\u2019 involvement was nothing more than 'an accounting exercise' between affiliates of the same group.306 Therefore, any alleged contribution done by the Fertinitro shareholders, including Inv. Polar, prior to Gambrinus\u2019 involvement in the project is irrelevant.307\n\n\u25a0 The 2008 Capital Contribution Agreement, constitutes a \"hypothetical call for funds, entirely guaranteed by Polar and limited to a minor proportion of the sums gained by way of dividends.\"308\n\n\u25a0 Similarly, the know-how that Mr. Grossman and Gabald\u00f3n as Directors could have brought to the Fertinitro Board was minimal an in any case cannot suffice as a \"contribution\" for purposes of the ICSID Convention, as it has been recognized by prior ICSID Tribunals.309\n\n\u25a0 Finally, Gambrinus cannot attempt to differentiate itself from Inv. Polar for purposes of establishing the nationality of the investors, while at the same time trying to treat the two entities as just one for purposes of contribution.310\n\n2. *The transfer from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus did not involve any risk.* Under the alleged Share Transfer, Inv. Polar remained liable for the obligations and Project risks,311 and in any case, since Gambrinus did not make any initial capital contributions or commitments, it was not in a position to risk a potential loss.312\n\n3. *Gambrinus alleged investment did not contribute to the economic development of Venezuela,* in the sense of contributing to the public interest and the transferring of know now.313\n\n4. *Gambrinus investment was not made in good faith.* Claimant is indistinguishable from Inv. Polar being therefore a Venezuelan based company suing its own State. The purported Share Transfer was done in violation of the Founding Agreements to gain ICSID jurisdiction and escape the expropriatory proceedings under Venezuelan law.314\n\n5. *Gambrinus investment was made fraudulently in breach of domestic law.* Citing to the *Phoenix* tribunal for support, it asserts that \"States cannot be deemed to offer access to the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments made in violation of their laws.\"315 Respondent argues that the Share Transfer constituted a fraudulent bid to bypass fundamental principles of domestic law and Claimant incurred a *fraude de ley.*\n\n*See* Resp.

Art. 2(1) of the BIT reads: \"Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create favorable conditions for nationals or companies of the Other Contracting Party to invest capital in its territory, and subject to its right to exercise powers conferred by its laws, shall admit such capital.\"\n\n**b.** ***Claimant\u2019s Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n225.\n\nRespondent, as the party putting forward an affirmative defense, such as its objection to the validity of Gambrinus\u2019 title, bears the burden of substantiating its position through evidence. The principle that the party who asserts must prove has been recognized by several ICSID tribunals.319\n\nCL. PHB (I) \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n\n226.\n\nClaimant also argues that there is no basis, either in the text of the JIA, or the Fertinitro ByLaws (nor under Venezuelan or international law), for challenging the 24 January 2008 transfer of Fertinitro shares from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus. The transfer was made in good faith, fully disclosed to all shareholders and accompanied by cash/cash equivalent consideration -namely, the obligation, assumed by Gambrinus at the time of the transfer, to pay Inv. Polar the sum of USD 80,000,100.320\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 1.\n\n(i) *The validity of the Share Transfer from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. The modalities of the Share Transfer and alleged applicable restrictions under the Founding Agreements\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nRespondent\u2019s \"new argument\" that the January 2008 acquisition did not satisfy a \"cash equivalent\" requirement of the JIA and Fertinitro By-Laws is meritless.\n\n228.\n\n\"Cash equivalent\" encompasses \"monetary obligations\" and payments of a money obligation, as articulated by both Parties\u2019 legal experts, Mr. Rodner and Dr. Garc\u00eda.321 The cash equivalent criterion in Section 6.7(i) of the JIA and Article 14 of the By-Laws is satisfied by payment in \"money equivalent.\"322\n\nCl. PHB (II), \u00b6 15, citing Garcia III, \u00b6 65 and Rodner Opinion \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 14.\n\n229.\n\nIn January 2008, \"to acquire the Fertinitro shares, Gambrinus undertook 'an obligation to pay [a] creditor a certain sum of money,' *i.e.* a 'money obligation'\"323 \"for 'money equivalent' which is also 'cash equivalent.'\"324\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 11.\n\nCl. PHB (II), \u00b6 16, citing Rodner Opinion, \u00b6 61.\n\n230.\n\nClaimant agrees with Respondent that the January acquisition was a \"set off' in which Gambrinus incurred debt to Inv. Polar in exchange of Fertinitro shares, and on 15 February 2008, Inv. Polar incurred debt to Gambrinus, in exchange of Gambrinus shares of the same value. Relying on Mr. Rodner, Claimant further states that these debts were \"set off' against each other; the transfer was thus conducted for \"set off' of money, *i.e.* two matching cash equivalent obligations, satisfying cash equivalency.325 This \"set off' of two mutual cash obligations was contemplated and authorized by the Venezuelan Civil Code.326\n\nCl. PHB (II), \u00b6 16, Rodner Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 59-62; Cl. Response, \u00b6 12. With regard to International Accounting Standard, Claimant asserts that it was not included as an exhibit in this arbitration and is not in the record, nor did Dr. Garcia rely on it in his expert report. In any case, IAS7 was an accounting standard adopted by Venezuela in 2008 and therefore cannot inform the interpretation of \"cash equivalency\" as drafted in the 1998 JIA and Fertinitro Bylaws. In any case, the cash equivalents in this transaction were offsetting cash obligations, not shares. Cl. PHB (II), \u00b6 17.\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 12.\n\n231.\n\nIn any case, the cash equivalency transfer requirement of the JIA and the Fertinitro Companies\u2019 By-laws, does not apply to inter-affiliate transfers.327 According to Claimant, \"Venezuelan law eschews interpretation of a contract which are at odds with the intention of the parties, ignores the contract as a whole, and... would have absurd consequences.\"328\n\n*Ibid,\u00b63.*\n\nIbid.\n\n232.\n\nClaimant also alleges that \"there is no reason in law or logic, why inter-affiliate transfers need to be subject to a 'cash equivalency' requirement, particularly given that the sole commercial rationale for that requirement is to [give] effect [to] the right of [first] refusal provisions in Sections 6.3 through 6.5.\"329\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 21; *see also,* \u00b6\u00b6 32-36.\n\n233.\n\nClaimant further rebuts the reasons provided by Respondent for the \"cash equivalent\" requirements as follows: First, it cannot be to provide solvency assurances of any new owner and economic standing to participate in the Project, because the JIA mandates that prior shareholders guarantee the obligations of the new affiliate.330 Second, members of the same group do not engage in protracted ownership struggles, and therefore there is no reason to include a \"cash equivalent\" restriction to \"limit potential disputes over ownership rights,\" as claimed by Respondent.331\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 37.\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 37.\n\n234.\n\nAccording to Claimant, further proof of the parties\u2019 intent lies in the fact that the range of \"Permitted Dispositions\" in Section 6.2 include numerous scenarios in which it is literally impossible to supply cash or cash equivalent payment of the kind urged by Venezuela and still be fully compliant with Section 6.7. Such is the case, for example, of the share for share exchanges between Pequiven and Venezuela\u2019s state-owned investment fund or \"VIE\" contemplated by Sections 6.2.1 and 2.1.1.332\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6\u00b6 23-24.\n\n235.\n\nWith regard to the alleged restrictions applicable under the By-Laws, Claimant answers that the By-laws contain mirror requirements to the JIA and argues that Respondent fails to mention relevant language of Articles 11 and 12 of the By-Laws.\n\n236.\n\nThis is further reinforced, according to Claimant, by the fact that neither the JIA, nor the ByLaws require that the price set out for an inter-affiliate transfer be disclosed, nor is there a requirement to disclose the kind or extent of the payment.333 This is in contrast to third-party transfers under Section 6.4 of the JIA.334\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 22.\n\nIbid.\n\n237.\n\nThe absence of a disclosure of price requirement is the reason why Claimant and Inv. Polar did not give information on the modality or the amount of the transfer price contained in the Share Transfer Agreement. No bad faith or misrepresentation can be concluded from this.335\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6\u00b6 32-34, 42, 43.\n\n238.\n\nMoreover, the 24 January 2008 email from Mr. Sim\u00f3n Guevara, Secretary of the Board of Fertinitro, to each of the Owners, including Pequiven, confirmed that \"after reviewing the By-Laws and the pertinent Sections of the Joint Investors Agreement... we are of the opinion that Inv. Polar ha[d] complied with all requirements to proceed to transfer its shares.\"336 The email contains no mention of cash equivalency, nor of any other Owner, including Pequiven, asking about cash equivalency since none of the parties expected or required, that cash equivalent consideration be furnished.337\n\n*Ib\u00edd,* \u00b6\u00b6 43, 44, referring to Email Exchange between S. Guevara and T. Parra, 24 January 2008 (RG-40).\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 45.\n\n2. Gambrinus\u2019 alleged acquisition of the Fertinitro shares\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nClaimant contends that Venezuela cannot dispute Gambrinus\u2019 titles to the shares. Relying on Mr. Rodner, Claimant asserts that, regardless of whether cash equivalence was applied or satisfied, Claimant would retain its substantial shareholding,\" as \"failure to satisfy cash equivalency does not, under Venezuelan law, lead to absolute nullity.\"338\n\nCl. PHB (II), \u00b6 22, Rodner Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 74-83.\n\n240.\n\nIn any case, Venezuela\u2019s new argument cannot divest the Tribunal of jurisdiction under the Treaty. According to Claimant, all of Respondent\u2019s cited authorities involved objectively grievous and knowing frauds, such as the \"knowing and intentional breach\" of criminal laws or falsity in documents.339 Citing to the *Metalpar* tribunal, Claimant alleges that \"divestment of jurisdiction is an excessive sanction for even a mere technical legal error, if one existed.\"340 According to Claimant, \"the present dispute, concem(s) a highly technical contractual provision raised at the eleventh hour, and then only to distort it\" therefore it cannot be compared to the authorities cited by Respondent.\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 47.\n\nIbid.\n\n241.\n\nRelying on Mr. Rodner, Gambrinus asserts that \"no fundamental principle of morality,\" \"public policy\" or \"illegality\" is implicated here.341\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 47.\n\n(ii) *Gambrinus\u2019 alleged investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n242.\n\nAccording to Claimant, it remains unrebutted by Venezuela that this Project satisfies the definition of investment included in Article 1(a) of the BIT, which defines investment broadly, to include \"shares and stock and debentures of a company.\" Gambrinus held at all material times, 10% of the outstanding shares in Fertinitro Oriente S.A. and Fertinitro Oriente C.E.C. Therefore, Claimant\u2019s equity ownership in an industrial facility, is a \"clear-cut investment.\"342\n\nCl. PHB (II), \u00b6 23.\n\n243.\n\nRespondent' belated argument that the term \"invested by\" incorporated in the BIT\u2019s definition of investment suggests that an \"active contribution\" is necessary, was raised for the first time at the Hearing. In any case, it is without merits and has already been rejected by the *Mytilineos* tribunal in connection with the Greece-Serbia BIT.343\n\nCl. PHB (I), \u00b6 21; Cl. PHB (II),\u00b6 23\n\n244.\n\nClaimant argues that by holding a \"shareholding in a large industrial concern\" Gambrinus held a \"classic form of an investment\" and therefore recourse to the *Salini* criteria \"are not required.\"344 In any case, the *Salini* criteria are met, because:\n\n1. *Claimant made a contribution* to acquire Fertinitro shares through the January 2008 Share Purchase Agreement,345 as well as know-how, managerial experience through Mr. Gabald\u00f3n and Mr. Grossman.346 Moreover, Claimant contributed \"by signing the 2008 Shareholder Additional Contribution Agreement, under which it committed to provide certain *pro rata* capital infusions, to bolster Fertinitro\u2019s bond ratings.\"347 In addition, Gambrinus corporate predecessors and affiliates made substantial contributions, which Claimant inherited.348\n\n2. *Claimant assumed risk* because it directly assumed all rights and obligations of the JIA, and entered into the 2008 Capital Contribution Agreement, obligating Gambrinus to make fresh injections if the project under-performed and allowing it to receive dividends.349 \"The mere fact that these contractual risks were subject to guarantees made by Inv. Polar and Cervecer\u00eda Polar, does not diminish Gambrinus\u2019 separate and independent legal and financial risks,\" as Claimant remained the primary contractual obligor.350\n\n3. *The contribution to the host state\u2019s development* is not an independent factor in the *Salini* analysis, as conceded by Respondent, but in any case, Fertinitro\u2019s contribution \"is obvious and incontestable.\"351\n\nCl.

Since this requirement is preliminary to any other conditions for jurisdiction *ratione materiae,* it shall be examined first.\n\n246.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimant failed to comply with the Joint Investors\u2019 Agreement and the Fertinitro By-Laws352 (jointly referred to by it as the \"Founding Agreements\") when the purported transfer of shares was made in January 2008, the transfer being consequently *\"null, void and of no force and effect\"353 as* it breached \"essential restrictions agreed from the outset\" in the referenced Founding Agreements. Since Gambrinus never acquired ownership of Fertinitro\u2019s shares,354 in Respondent\u2019s view it has no standing before the Tribunal and jurisdiction should be declined on this basis.355\n\nRespondent refers specifically to the By-Laws of Fertinitro Oriente S.A. and Fertinitro Oriente C.E.C, the shares of which were directly owned by the shareholders of the Project and which were, among others, the object of the Share Transfer Agreement between Gambrinus and Inv. Polar in January 2008. According to Respondent, both By-Laws had been registered on 27 March 1998 with the Commercial Registry of the State of Miranda. Resp. Submission, \u00b6 8.\n\nResp. PHB (II), \u00b628.\n\nResp. Submission, \u00b6 45.\n\nResp. PHB (II), \u00b6 30.\n\n247.\n\nArticle VI of the JIA, regulating the transfer of Fertinitro\u2019s shares, is applicable. It provides as follows in Sections 6.1. and 6.2:\n\n6.1. Restriction on Transfer. No Owner shall give, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, mortgage, grant a security interest in, or otherwise dispose of and/or encumber any of its interests or any interest therein (\"Disposition\") other than a Disposition permitted under Section 6.2 unless such Owner complies with the provisions of this Article VI. Any Disposition attempted or made without full compliance with this Article VI in its entirety shall be null, void and of no force or effect.\n\n6.2 Permitted Dispositions. The following Dispositions shall be permitted without compliance with any other provision of this Article VI other than Section 6.7:\n\n6.2.1 by Pequiven to VIE as contemplated in Section 2.1.1;\n\n6.2.2 by an Owner to an Affiliate of such Owner (including any Special Purpose Subsidiary) if: (a) such Owner has provided at least thirty (30) days written notice of such Disposition to the Company, Comandita and each of the other Owners; [...] (d) the transferring Owner agrees, pursuant to instruments in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the non-transferring Owners, to remain responsible with the transferee Affiliate for compliance with all the obligations of the transferring Owner under this Agreement, including execution of a Parent Performance Agreement by any Parent Company of the transferee, if applicable; and (e) the transferee Affiliate becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to the instruments in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the non-transferring Owners. [...]\n\n248.\n\nAccording to Section 6.2, any Disposition is subject to the additional conditions of Section 6.7, which provides as follows:\n\n6.7. Additional Interest Transfer Requirements. Any Disposition of Interests is subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:\n\n(i) Any Disposition shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalents to the exclusion of any other consideration;\n\n(ii) Any Disposition must be for a Proportionate number of Shares and Comandita Passive Shares;\n\n\u2026\n\n(v) Any transferee of Interests, including an Affiliate of the transferor, shall, by a written instrument executed and delivered to the Company and the Remaining Owners before the Disposition is agreed to or concluded, (a) authorize, approve and adopt this Agreement and assume all of the obligations of an Owner hereunder as if it were an original, named, party hereto, including execution of a Parent Performance Agreement by any Parent Company, if applicable, (b) make representations and warranties substantially equivalent to those made by Pequiven, Koch, Snamprogetti and Polar in Article III, and (c) provide an address and facsimile number to the Company and the Owners for purposes of Section 13.14.\n\n249.\n\nRespondent refers to the By-Laws of Fertinitro Oriente S.A. assuming that the same replicates the provisions of the JIA regarding share transfer restrictions.356 Under the Founding Agreements any share transfer, including to Affiliates, in order to be valid would have to be made *\"exclusively for cash or cash equivalents to the exclusion of any other consideration.\"* Contrary to this provision, according to Respondent the parties devised a \"share-for-share transaction\" by which Gambrinus, instead of paying in cash or cash equivalent for the shares in Fertinitro, issued further shares in itself to Inv. Polar in exchange for the shares in Fertinitro,357 this share-for-share being recognised by Claimant as having occurred.358\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 14 and n. 19.\n\n*Ibid.,\u00b6* 23.\n\nCl. Rej.,\u00b6 60.\n\n250.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the detailed restrictions of the JIA regarding share transfers were the result of careful drafting and analysis given the importance of the partners and their identity, each of whom had been carefully selected to participate in the Fertinitro Project, because they offered \"strategic advantages.\"359 Any attempted transfer in violation of the restrictions of Article VI would be null, void and legally ineffective.360 These restrictions equally applied to a transfer of shares to an affiliate. Although a Permitted Disposition under Section 6.2, a transfer to an affiliate would also be subject in any case to satisfaction of each of the conditions of Section 6.7, including the requirement that \"any Disposition shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalents to the exclusion of any other considerations.\" According to Respondent, this condition would have assisted in ensuring, among other things, the solvency and economic standing of the transferee, the transparency as to the value of the disposition and the genuine character of the operation.361\n\nRelying on Mr. Gabald\u00f3n, Respondent states that Polar was selected \"because the presence of a private investor with experience in the Venezuelan market would provide confidence to banks and foreign lenders in relation to the financing of the project.\" Resp. Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 4,7,8, citing Gabald\u00f3n (I), \u00b6 10 and Tr.

PHB (I), \u00b6 59.\n\n251.\n\nClaimant replies that there is no basis under the JIA or the Fertinitro By-Laws or international law for challenging the January 24, 2008 transfer of shares from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus.362 Claimant relies on the legal opinion of Mr. James Otis Rodner (the **\"Rodner Opinion\")** according to which the JIA cash requirement does not apply in case of inter-affiliate transfers, the purpose of the requirement that the transfer be for cash or cash equivalents being to facilitate the \"right of first refusal regime\" requiring a departing shareholder to offer its interest to the other shareholders prior to sales to unaffiliated third parties.363 This right requires for its exercise that the price at which the shares to be transferred are offered for sale be stated in money and payable only in money. Since no such \"right of first refusal,\" arises with respect to inter-affiliate transfers, there is no reason why the cash equivalency requirement shall be applicable.364\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 1.\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 3. The right of first refusal is provided by Section 6.3-6.6 of the JIA (C-6) and Article 13 of the By-Laws of both Fertinitro de Oriente S.A. (RG-11) and Fertinitro C.E.C. (R-109).\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4. *See also,* Rodner Opinion, \u00b6 29.\n\n252.\n\nAccording to the Rodner Opinion, to apply the cash equivalency requirement to any transfers between affiliates would lead to the absurd result of disallowing various \"Permitted Dispositions\" under Section 6.2, specifically inter-affiliate transfers pursuant to liquidation or merger under Section 6.2.2 or a share-for-share transfer under Section 6.2.1 since these Dispositions cannot be made \"exclusively\" for \"cash equivalent consideration\" as expressed by Section 6.7(i).365\n\nRodner Opinion, \u00b6 28.\n\n253.\n\nClaimant contends that Fertinitro By-Laws, far from being identical to the JIA as asserted by Respondent,366 actually state that inter-affiliate transfers may be made without complying with \"cash equivalents\" requirement.367 According to Claimant, under the 24 January 2008 Share Purchase Agreement, Gambrinus assumed the \"obligation to pay the money sum of USD 80,000,100.00 as payment for the shares in question\"368 and the cash nature of this obligation is not altered by it being later offset by matching a cash obligation assumed by Inv. Polar under the 15 February 2008 Common Share Subscription Agreement.369\n\nRespondent\u2019s Closing Presentation, slide 25; Resp. Submission, \u00b6 14.\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 7.\n\nShare Purchase Agreement (RG-37).\n\nCommon Share Subscription Agreement dated 15 February 2008 (RG-120); Cl. Response, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n\n254.\n\nAccording to the Rodner Opinion, under the Fertinitro By-Laws the cash equivalent requirement under Article 14 for a shareholder\u2019s sale of its shares, applies with the express exclusion of the transactions mentioned in Article 12 regarding inter-affiliate transfers, such as the transfer made from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus. According to the Rodner Opinion, Article 12 provides that \"the shareholders can sell... transfer... without the obligation of compliance with the provisions of this Chapter (the reference is to Chapter III of the Charter)... in case of... transfer by a shareholder in favor of an Affiliate.\"370\n\nRodner Opinion, \u00b6 27.\n\n255.\n\nThe Rodner Opinion reminds that contracts in Venezuela, as in many civil law countries, are interpreted taking into account the real intentions of the parties, avoiding absurd results and looking at the contract as a whole, meaning by that that one must not read individual provisions without relating them to the parties\u2019 intentions when entering into the contract and to the remaining clauses in the contract. Under civil law systems, this is a systemic interpretation *(\"interpretaci\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica\")* where each clause in the contract, being a logical part of an integrated system, is given meaning that is coherent with the contract as a whole.371\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 25.\n\n256.\n\nThe Rodner Opinion adds that in civil law, including Venezuelan law, when the same parties enter into several contracts that deal with the same subject, if there is a contradiction in the terms used in both contracts, the language in the later contract prevails over the language in the earlier contract. The later document in this case is the Fertinitro C.E.C. Charter, which has a higher standing, the JIA having been entered into on 8 April 1998 while that Charter was registered in the Mercantile Registry on 21 May 1998, after the date of the JIA. According to the principle that the latest expression of the parties should be given prevailing consideration, if, in relation to a particular requirement under both agreements, the terms of the Fertinitro Charter differ from the terms in the JIA, the terms in the Fertinitro Charter prevail over the terms in the JIA.372\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* \u00b6 26.\n\n257.\n\nRespondent contends on its side that any provisions which are the product of the will of the parties to a contract and which are not contrary to public order or good moral standards, shall be deemed valid and of full force and effect between them, this being the case of the \"cash or cash equivalent\" requirement. It adds that in light of the prevalence of the principle of party autonomy, statutory provisions have merely a supplementary nature in relation to contractual provisions.373 Had the parties wished to exclude inter-affiliate transfers from the \"cash or cash equivalent\" requirement, they could easily have done so, tribunals being not supposed to rewrite the parties\u2019 agreement by resorting to rules of interpretation that are applicable in case of obscurity, ambiguities or deficiencies in the parties\u2019 intention, which is not the present case.374\n\nResp. PHB (I), \u00b6 62.\n\n*Ibid.,\u00b6\u00b6* 63-69.\n\n258.\n\nRespondent contends further that the Fertinitro By-Laws may only give effect to the will of the parties as reflected in the JIA which, as provided by Section 13.12, \"may not be altered, modified, amended or changed in any manner... except pursuant to a written agreement executed and delivered by all of the Owners.\" In any case, the By-Laws confirm that the requirement of consideration in cash or cash equivalent applies *\"sin perjuicio de cualesquiera otras previsiones\"* and applies to *\"cualquier transferencia o enajenaci\u00f3n de acciones de la Sociedad.\"375* No evidence is given by Claimant as to why the cash equivalent clause should be excluded in case of inter-affiliate transfers, Section 6.7 not dealing with pre-emption rights so that situations of pre-emption cannot have been the reason for including the cash or cash equivalent requirement.376 Claimant failed to make any payment of cash or cash equivalent consideration as required, the share-for-share set off being not a *\"payment in any manner of representing money\"* according to the Rodner Opinion\u2019s interpretation, falling rather within \"any other consideration,\" which is specifically excluded by the Founding Agreements.377\n\n*Ibid.,\u00b6\u00b6* 70-71.\n\n*Ib\u00edd.,* \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.\n\nIbid., \u00b6\u00b6 78-82.\n\n259.\n\nIt is Claimant\u2019s position that the parties\u2019 real intention regarding the precise scope of the condition under Section 6.7(i) of the JIA that \"[a]ny Disposition of Interest shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalents to the exclusion of any other consideration\" is made uncertain by at least two reasons:\n\n\u25a0 The difference in the formulation of Article VI of the JIA and Chapter III of the Fertinitro By-Laws regarding the applicability of the same condition to the transfer of shares to Affiliates;378\n\n\u25a0 The fact that the application of this condition to any \"Disposition of Interest\" will lead to the absurd result of disallowing various of the Permitted Dispositions under Section 6.2.379\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 253.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 254.\n\n260.\n\nRegarding the first of Claimant\u2019s remarks, the Tribunal is asked to interpret the provisions regulating the transfer of Fertinitro\u2019s shares contained in an agreement governed by Venezuelan law380 in relation to the corresponding provisions of Fertinitro By-Laws adopting a different formulation.\n\nJIA, Section 13.7 \"Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, construed under and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Venezuela without regard to the conflicts-of-law provisions thereof.\"\n\n261.\n\nIt should initially be mentioned that there is no prevalence of the Fertinitro By-Laws over the text of the JIA. According to Section 2.1 of the JIA, \"[t]he Owners acknowledge and agree that each of the Charter / By-Laws, the *Comandita* Charter / By-Laws, the S.R.L. Charter/ By-Laws and Operating Company Charter / By-Laws have been registered and shall be modified, if necessary, to reflect the provisions of this Agreement.\" Thus, it is rather for the By-Laws of Fertinitro to reflect the terms of the JIA, not the contrary. To the extent the terms of the By-Laws depart or conflict with the terms of the JIA, the terms of the latter prevail.\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that differently from Section 6.2 of the JIA which makes any Disposition of shares, not excluding transfers to Affiliates, subject to the condition of a \"cash or cash equivalents\" consideration under Section 6.7(i), no similar condition is apparently prescribed by the Fertinitro By-Laws regarding transfers to Affiliates.381 Under Article 12 of the ByLaws (entitled \"Exception to the Restriction on Disposal and Encumbrance of Company Shares\"), the shareholders may transfer or confer rights on their shares without being obliged to comply with the provisions of Chapter III (inclusive of Articles 11 to 15), \"except where provided for under paragraph three of clause thirteen,\" in case (under B) of disposal of shares to Affiliates. Paragraph three of Article 13, dealing with \"Transfers to Third Parties,\" is no exception to the unconditioned disposal of shares to Affiliates under Article 12, considering that transfers to Affiliates are not transfers to Third Parties.\n\nIn examining the By-Laws the Tribunal shall follow the English translation provided by Claimant on 23 July 2014, accepted by its decision of February 4, 2015. Respondent has declared not to accept Claimant\u2019s translation of the ByLaws in its communication of 11 February 2015: however, its translation of Article 14, used by Resp. Submission (ns. 22 and 23), conforms substantially to Claimant\u2019s translation.\n\n263.\n\nUnder Article 14 of the Fertinitro By-Laws, any transfer or disposal of shares in the Company, to be valid, must meet the condition that \"[t]he only compensation to be received by the assignor-shareholder.... shall be funds in cash (or an equivalent in foreign currency), to the exclusion of all other compensation.\" The reference made at the beginning of Article 14 to \"any transfer or disposal of Company shares\" includes, due to its generality, transfers to Affiliates. This would be in conflict with the exemption of transfer to Affiliates from the condition of payment in cash or cash equivalent under Article 12. However, the conflict is removed by the starting language of Article 14, making its provisions applicable \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision contained in these Articles of Incorporation/ ByLaws,\" the reference to any other provision including Article 12.\n\n264.\n\nThe prevalence of Article 14 over the exemption of transfer to Affiliates under Article 12 is confirmed by the last part of the same Article 14, providing (under B) that \"[a]ny disposal or transfer of Company shares must be carried out pursuant to the provisions contained in the Agreement,\" where \"Agreement\" cannot but refer to the JIA. Also under the By-Laws, therefore, transfers of shares to Affiliates are subject for their validity to the condition of payment being made in cash or cash equivalents, as provided by Section 6.7(i) of the JIA.\n\n265.\n\nBoth Parties and their legal experts have made reference to the rules of contract interpretation of Venezuelan law reaching however different conclusions.382 The Tribunal notes that according to Article 12 of the Venezuelan Code of Civil Procedure,\n\n*En la interpretaci\u00f3n de contratos o actos que presenten oscuridad, ambig\u00fcedad o deficiencia, los jueces se atendr\u00e1n al prop\u00f3sito y ala intenci\u00f3n de las partes o de los otorgantes, teniendo en mira las exigencias de la Ley, de la verdad y de la buena, fe*.383\n\nIt does not believe that the situation confronting the Parties in the present case is characterized by *\"oscuridad, ambig\u00fcedad o deficiencia,\"* as required by Article 12 of the Venezuelan Code to allow for the real intention of the parties to take precedence over the contract language.\n\nClaimant, *supra,* \u00b6\u00b6 255-256; Respondent, *supra,* \u00b6 257.\n\nM\u00e9lich Orsini, *La interpretaci\u00f3n del contrato en Venezuela,* in \"Tratado de Interpretaci\u00f3n del contrato en America Latina,\" Volume II, Lima (2007) (JR-10) p. 2280.\n\n266.\n\nThere is no \"obscurity, ambiguity or deficiency\" in the provisions of the JIA regulating the transfer of shares, including with regard to the condition under Section 6.7(i) that any transfer, not excluding transfers to Affiliates, \"be made for cash or cash equivalents.\" The Tribunal is not supposed to modify the Parties\u2019 agreement merely because one might believe that requiring the application of this condition also in case of inter-affiliate transfers would serve no useful purpose, particularly none of the purposes assigned by Respondent to this condition,384 since any such transfer is subject in any case to the transferor\u2019s guarantee to the other shareholders for the transferee\u2019s obligations.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 250.\n\n267.\n\nLikewise, the Tribunal is not supposed to interpret the parties\u2019 agreement under the JIA so as to exclude that the condition of payment in cash or cash equivalent under Section 6.7(i) apply to intra-affiliate transfers only because it is reasonable to think that the real purpose of that condition is to permit the exercise of the right of first refusal of the other shareholders. By the same token, the Tribunal should not rewrite the parties\u2019 agreement because otherwise the condition of a \"cash or cash equivalent\" consideration under Section 6.7(i) would not permit implementing some of the Permitted Dispositions under Section 6.2 of the JIA. The Tribunal\u2019s appreciation of the real impact of that condition in those different cases is no substitute for the parties\u2019 free determination in that regard.\n\n268.\n\nThe condition that payment for the transfer of Fertinitro shares be made in cash or cash equivalents applies therefore also to the transfer of shares to Gambrinus as an Affiliate of Inv. Polar. The payment of the price for such transfer was agreed in the Share Purchase Agreement in the sum of USD 80,000,100.00 which, as stated therein, \"will be paid to THE SELLER by THE BUYER at a future date following the granting of this document.\"385 It formally conformed to the condition prescribed by the JIA for such payment, leading to believe that Claimant was aware that this condition had to be complied with also for the transfer to an Affiliate. The Tribunal is further comforted in its conclusion by the clear statement of Inv. Polar itself in its letter of 21 January 2008 to the other investors stating that the transfer of all its Fertinitro shares to Gambrinus would take place, \"all in compliance with Sections 6.2.2 and 6.7 of the Joint Investors\u2019 Agreement and Section 12(b) of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the *Commandita* and the Company.\"386\n\nShares Purchase Agreement (RG-37), Clause THREE.\n\nAssignment Agreement (C-4).\n\n269.\n\nBefore such payment would be made, however, the parties agreed under the Common Share Subscription Agreement of 15 February 2008 to convert it into a share-for-share payment, Gambrinus issuing shares in itself to Inv. Polar, the amount due by the latter for the newly issued shares being set off against the same amount due by Gambrinus to Inv. Polar for the transfer of Fertinitro\u2019s shares.387 The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that shares in Gambrinus are not a cash equivalent as they are not \"an immediately realizable liquid asset,\" Gambrinus not being traded publicly.388\n\nGambrinus Corp. Resolution, 15 February 2008 (RG-119).\n\nResp. Submission, \u00b6 36.\n\n270.\n\nRespondent contends that it learnt of the share-for-share transfer to Gambrinus only during the proceedings, Claimant having repeatedly represented that there had been a valid share transfer to then admit, only in its Rejoinder of 17 January 2014, the nature of the transfer.389 It adds that the purported share transfer was made in breach of the general principle under Venezuela law of good faith, so that even if Gambrinus had actually acquired the ownership of Fertinitro shares the transfer cannot be opposed against the other Owners or third parties, Claimant being not entitled to claim the BIT protection due to its lack of good faith.390\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 53, 64.\n\n271.\n\nClaimant denies having breached the good faith principle or made any misleading representations or having concealed the true nature of the transaction, Gambrinus and Inv. Polar having complied with Section 6.7 of the JIA considering how it was interpreted.391 It explains that the reference to a \"December 12, 2007\" share agreement in the Common Share Subscription Agreement was the result of a clerical error so that it does not suggest that the transfer was made in breach of good faith before consent was given by the other shareholders on 22-23 January 2008.392\n\nCl. Response, \u00b6 47; Rodner Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 67-70.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 73.\n\n272.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the condition under Section 6.7(i) that any transfer of shares be made for cash or cash equivalents was considered by the parties to the JIA to be an essential element of the contract.393 This is evidenced by the seriousness of the sanction that had been agreed in case of breach of such condition, the \"nullity\" and the \"no force or effect\" of the purported transfer.\n\nResp. Submission, \u00b6 44; Montoya Opinion, \u00b6 54.\n\n273.\n\nThe transfer of shares between Gambrinus and Inv. Polar made on 24 January 2008 under the Share Purchase Agreement may not be given effect in the present case in view of the breach of the agreed essential condition that the transfer be made for cash or cash equivalents, the share-for-share consideration agreed in the Common Share Subscription Agreement of 15 February 2008 being not equivalent to cash.\n\n274.\n\nThis conclusion dispenses the Tribunal from dealing with Respondent\u2019s subordinate claim whereby, since the investment was not made in good faith, it should in any case be denied protection. For what may be of relevance in the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that Claimant did not act in breach of the good faith, its conduct being rather motivated by an erroneous interpretation of the relevant provisions of the JIA and the By-Laws. For that reasons, there was no bad faith representation by Claimant to the other shareholders that the transfer would comply with Sections 6.2.2 and 6.7 of the JIA.394\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 268.\n\n275.\n\nAs confirmed by a recent ICSID award, \"a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to a dispute between the host State and a national or company which has acquired its protected investment before the alleged breach occurred.\"395 This holding, which follows a long series of consistent investment treaty decisions,396 is based on the principle whereby \"the substantive protections of the BIT apply to the State conduct that occurred after these protections became applicable to the eligible investment.\"397\n\n*Ren\u00e9e Rose Levy and Gremcitel S.A.* v. *Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/17, Award, 9 January 2015, \u00b6 146.\n\n*Ibid.,* n. 171.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 147.\n\n276.\n\nClaimant\u2019s claim in this arbitration is founded on Respondent\u2019s expropriation of its investment on October 10, 2010 in breach of Article 5 of the BIT398 as well as on the breach of the fair and equitable treatment of its investment under Article 2(2) of the BIT due to Respondent\u2019s expropriatory actions.399 Claimant owned no investment at the time of the alleged expropriation of Fertinitro shares on 10 October 2010, due to the Share Purchase Agreement with Inv. Polar being of no force and effect.400 Having made no investment which may fall within the BIT protection, Claimant\u2019s claim is not subject to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction which, accordingly, must be declined.\n\nCl. Mem., \u00b6 155.\n\n*Ibid.,* \u00b6 132.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 273.\n\n277.\n\nAt the end of the analysis of jurisdiction *ratione personae,* the Tribunal indicated that it would examine in the context of jurisdiction *ratione materiae* whether Gambrinus owns an investment in Venezuela and, if so, whether it is a shell company having made no contribution, as alleged by Respondent.401 Having reached the conclusion that Claimant did not own an investment in Venezuela at the time of the alleged BIT breaches, the Tribunal has declined jurisdiction. Accordingly, there shall be no further analysis of the present case by the Tribunal.\n\n*Supra,* \u00b6 147.\n\n**VI. THE COSTS OF THE PROCEEDING**\n-----------------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe Parties filed simultaneous submissions on costs on 17 October 2014 and simultaneous reply submissions on 31 October 2014.\n\n279.\n\nIn its submission Claimant contends that it should be awarded the totality of its arbitration costs, including legal fees, experts\u2019 fees, and other disbursements associated with this arbitration, as well as its share of the costs of the Tribunal and the Centre, in the amount of USD 7,817,562.63.\n\n280.\n\nIn its submissions Respondent argues that regardless of the outcome of this case Claimant\u2019s behaviour throughout this arbitration justifies its bearing all costs incurred in these proceedings, *i.e.* its own costs as well as Respondent\u2019s costs for a total amount of USD 7,607,586.24 (the share of ICSID costs, equal to USD 350,000, being provisional). According to Respondent, the arbitration was unnecessary since negotiations with Pequiven on compensation should have been maintained until their conclusion. Had Claimant disclosed from the outset that the purported share transfer had been done in breach of the relevant agreements Respondent would have been in a position to object initially to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n281.\n\nThe fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses amount to USD 731,432.65, divided as follows (in USD):402\n\nArbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses:\n\nProf. Piero Bemardini USD 182,932.56\n\nThe Hon. Marc Lalonde USD 151,942.80\n\nProfessor Pierre-Marie Dupuy USD 170,613.69\n\nICSID\u2019s administrative fees: US$ 128,000.00\n\nICSID\u2019s expenses(estimated):403 US$ 101,881.10\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account as soon as all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\nThe amount includes estimated charges (courier, printing and copying) in respect of the dispatch of this Award.\n\n282.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s fees and expenses as well as ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and expenses are paid out of the advances made by the Parties. As a result, each Party\u2019s share of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 365,716.32.404\n\nThe remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n283.\n\nThe Tribunal has the power to order costs under Article 61 (2) of the ICSID Convention,\u00a0which provides:\n\nIn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Center shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\n\nIt is recognized that in awarding costs the Tribunal enjoys broad discretion, subject to the exercise of discretion being explained, as required by Article 48 (3) of the ICSID Convention providing that \"[t] he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.\"405\n\nSchreuer, The ICSID Convention - A Commentary, 2nd edition 2009, p. 1235, \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.\n\n284.\n\nThe outcome of the case has been to some extent in each Party\u2019s favour, the Tribunal having rejected Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections *ratione personae* and *ratione temporis* but having accepted to decline jurisdiction, as requested by Respondent, due to Claimant\u2019s lack of title to an investment in Venezuela.\n\n285.\n\nIn view of the outcome of the case, the Tribunal considers appropriate that each Party bear in full its own legal fees and costs and that the Parties equally share the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the ICSID facilities.\n\n**VII. THE TRIBUNAL'S DECISION**\n--------------------------------\n\n286.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n1. The Centre has no jurisdiction and the Tribunal has no competence to hear Claimant\u2019s claims.\n\n2. Each Party shall bear in full all legal fees and costs it has incurred and shall equally share the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs for the use of the facilities of the Centre."}, {"Title": "Decision on Annulment", "Type": "Annulment", "Date": "2017-10-03T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Annulment\n---------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Table of Selected Abbreviations/Defined Terms** | |\n| A-[#] | Applicant\u2019s Exhibit |\n| AL-[#] | Applicant\u2019s Legal Authority |\n| Applicant | Gambrinus Corp. |\n| Application | Application for Annulment of the Award dated October 9, 2015 |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of 2006 |\n| Arbitration Hearing | Hearing on jurisdiction and the merits held in Paris on March 10-13, 2014 |\n| Award | Gambrinus Corp. v.

INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATION**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns an application for annulment (the **\"Application\")** of the award rendered on June 15, 2015 in ICSID Case No. ARB/11/31 (the **\"Award\")** in the arbitration proceeding between Gambrinus Corporation **(\"Gambrinus\"** or the **\"Applicant\")** and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the **\"Respondent\"** or **\"Venezuela\").**\n\n2.\n\nThe Applicant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the **\"Parties.\"** The Parties\u2019 representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).\n\n3.\n\nThe Award decided on a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes **(\"ICSID\"** or the **\"Centre\")** on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated July 15, 1994, which entered into force on October 31, 1995 (the **\"BIT\"** or **\"Treaty\"),** and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated March 18,1965, which entered into force on October 14,1966 (the **\"ICSID Convention\").**\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute relates to the alleged expropriation by the Respondent of Gambrinus\u2019 ten percent (10%) equity interest in a group of four Venezuelan companies, jointly referred to as \"Fertinitro,\" which produces nitrogen fertilizers (ammonia and urea) for export and internal use in Venezuela, through the operation and maintenance of four petrochemical plants.\n\n5.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal reached the conclusion that Gambrinus did not own an investment in Venezuela at the time of the alleged BIT breaches and, therefore, declined jurisdiction.\n\n6.\n\nGambrinus applied for the annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) subparagraphs (b), (d), and (e) of the ICSID Convention, identifying three grounds for annulment: (i) manifest excess of powers; (ii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and (iii) failure to state the reasons on which the Award is based.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n7.\n\nOn October 9, 2015, Gambrinus filed with the Secretary-General of ICSID the Application.\n\n8.\n\nThe Application was filed in accordance with Article 52 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 50 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings **(\"Arbitration Rules\"****),** within 120 days after the date of the Award.\n\n9.\n\nOn October 16, 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID informed the Parties that the Application had been registered on that date and that the Chairman of the Administrative Council of ICSID would proceed to appoint an *ad hoc* committee pursuant to Article 52(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n10.\n\nBy letter of January 15, 2016, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 52(2), the Secretary-General notified the Parties that the *ad hoc* committee (the **\"Committee\")** had been constituted and that the annulment proceeding was deemed to have begun on that date.\n\n11.\n\nThe Committee was composed of Tan Sri Dato' Cecil W.M.

THE AWARD**\n------------------\n\n23.\n\nBelow is a brief summary of the relevant sections of the Award, including a summary of the facts that are relevant for the purpose of the present annulment proceedings.2\n\nThis factual summary is based on the facts described in the Award and is not intended to be an exhaustive and detailed narrative of all such facts. Rather, its purpose is simply to provide the general context of this Decision.\n\n**A. Summary of Relevant Facts**\n--------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nDuring the 90\u2019s Venezuela decided to increase its production of fertilizers.3 During that time, Venezuela through its State-owned entity, Petroqu\u00edmica de Venezuela S.A.4**(\"Pequiven\"),** sought private partners to participate in the development of a fertilizer production facility.5\n\nAward, \u00b6 34.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 8 (\"Petroqu\u00edmica de Venezuela ('Pequiven') [is] a wholly owned subsidiary of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A. (or \"PDVSA\") the state-owned oil company.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 35.\n\n25.\n\nAs a result, on April 8, 1998, Pequiven, Polar Uno C.A., later named Inversiones Polar S.A.6 (hereinafter, **\"Polar\"),** a company incorporated in Venezuela, Koch Oil S.A. (later denominated Koch Minerals S.a.r.l.) **(\"Koch\"),** a company incorporated in Switzerland, and Snamprogetti B.V. **(\"Snamprogetti\"),** a company incorporated in the Netherlands, concluded a Joint Investors\u2019 Agreement (the **\"JIA\"),** setting forth the contractual framework for the construction, operation and investment terms of two ammonia plants (the **\"Project\").7**\n\nOn May 12, 1998, Polar Uno C.A. changed its name to Inversiones Polar S.A. *Id.,* \u00b6 46.\n\n*Id*.,\u00b638.\n\n26.\n\nPursuant to the JIA, the four joint investors (also referred as **\"Owners\"** under the JIA), agreed to the creation of four Venezuelan companies, jointly referred to as \"Fertinitro\": Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente, S.A. (the **\"Company\");** Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente C.E.C. (the ***\"Comandita\")',*** Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela S.R.L.; and Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, Fertinitro C.E.C. (the **\"Operating Company\").8**\n\nId.,\u00b638.\n\n27.\n\nAccording to Section 2.1 of the JIA, the ownership structure of Fertinitro was as follows: 35% owned by Pequiven; 35% owned by Koch; 20% owned by Snamprogetti and 10% owned by Polar.\n\n28.\n\nKoch and Polar owned their respective interests in the Project through wholly owned \"Special Purpose Subsidiaries\" (as defined in the JIA), namely Koch Jos\u00e9 Cayman Islands Limited **(\"Koch Jos\u00e9\"),** and Polar Jos\u00e9 Investments Limited, **(\"Polar Jos\u00e9\")** respectively, both companies organized under the laws of Cayman Islands. In accordance with Section 2.4 of the JIA and its Recitals, Koch and Polar as Owners, remained responsible together with the Special Purpose Subsidiaries for compliance with all the obligations under the JIA. Moreover, the only assets of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries were the shares or debt in the Fertinitro Companies. By February 18, 1998, Koch transferred 28,571% of its interest in Koch Jos\u00e9 to Latin American Investment Fund **(\"LAIF\").** LAIF then became a 10% shareholder of Fertinitro.9\n\nId.,\u00b640.\n\n29.\n\nArticle VI of the JIA regulated the transfer of Fertinitro\u2019s shares. Sections 6.1. and 6.2 provided as follows:\n\n*6.1. Restriction on Transfer. No Owner shall give, sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate, mortgage, grant a security interest in, or otherwise dispose of and/or encumber any of its interests or any interest therein (''Disposition \") other than a Disposition permitted under Section 6.2 unless such Owner complies with the provisions of this Article VI. **Any Disposition attempted or made without full compliance with this Article VI in its entirety shall be null, void and of no force or effect.***\n\n*6.2 Permitted Dispositions. The following Dispositions shall be permitted without compliance with any other provision of this Article VI other than Section 6.7:*\n\n*6.2.1 by Pequiven to VIE as contemplated in Section 2.1.1;*\n\n*6.2.2 by an Owner to an Affiliate of such Owner (including any Special Purpose Subsidiary) if: (a) such Owner has provided at least thirty (30) days written notice of such Disposition to the Company, Comandita and each of the other Owners; [...] (d) the transferring Owner agrees, pursuant to instruments in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the non-transferring Owners, to remain responsible with the transferee Affiliate for compliance with all the obligations of the transferring Owner under this Agreement, including execution of a Parent Performance Agreement by any Parent Company of the transferee, if applicable; and (e) the transferee Affiliate becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to the instruments in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the non-transferring Owners. [...]*\n\n30.\n\nIn accordance with Section 6.2 of the JIA, all \"Permitted Dispositions\" are subject to the requirements set forth in Section 6.7, which provides as follows:\n\n*6.7. Additional Interest Transfer Requirements. Any Disposition of Interests is subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:*\n\n*(i) **Any Disposition shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalents to the exclusion of any other consideration;***\n\n*(ii) Any Disposition must be for a Proportionate number of Shares and Comandita Passive Shares;*\n\n\u2026\n\n*(v) Any transferee of Interests, including an Affiliate of the transferor, shall, by a written instrument executed and delivered to the Company and the Remaining Owners before the Disposition is agreed to or concluded, (a) authorize, approve and adopt this Agreement and assume all of the obligations of an Owner hereunder as if it were an original, named, party hereto, including execution of a Parent Performance Agreement by any Parent Company, if applicable, (b) make representations and warranties substantially equivalent to those made by Pequiven, Koch, Snamprogetti and Polar in Article III, and (c) provide an address and facsimile number to the Company and the Owners for purposes of Section 13.14.*\n\n31.\n\nIn 2001, Snamprogetti completed the construction of the Fertinitro plants and facilities and commercial production commenced the same year.10\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 45.\n\n32.\n\nOn August 6, 2001, Polar decided to remove Polar Jos\u00e9 (the Special Purpose Subsidiary of the Cayman Island) from the Fertinitro investment structure, and, instead, to own its shares through Inversiones Polar S.A., the parent company. Polar Jos\u00e9 completed the transaction without objection from the other shareholders.11\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 46.\n\n33.\n\nOn January 21, 2008, pursuant to Section 6.2.2 of the JIA and Section 12(b) of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Company and the *Comandita* (the **\"Fertinitro ByLaws\"),** Polar notified Pequiven, Koch, Snamprogetti, the *Comandita* and the Company, of its intention to \"transfer all the Polar Interests to Gambrinus Corporation.\" In that same letter, Polar specified that it \"desired to consummate the transfer as soon as practicable, and no later than 24 January 2008.\" Polar then requested from the addressee\u2019s shareholders a \"waiver\" of the 30-day prior notice requirements contemplated in the JIA for transfers to affiliates.12\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 55.\n\n34.\n\nThe January 21, 2008 notice was accompanied by an \"Assumption Instrument\" dated January 22, 2008, to be signed by Polar and Gambrinus \"before the consumption of the Transfer, all in compliance with Sections 6.2.2 and 6.7 of the [JIA] and Section 12(b) of [Fertinitro By-Laws].\" Under the terms of the executed Assumption Instrument:\n\n\u2022 Polar agreed to remain jointly and severally \"responsible\" with Gambrinus for compliance with all the obligation of Polar under the JIA;\n\n\u2022 Polar agreed to repurchase its interest in Fertinitro should Gambrinus cease to be an affiliate of Polar; and\n\n\u2022 Gambrinus agreed to become a part to the JIA, adopted the JIA and assumed all of the obligations as if it were an original \"named party thereto.\"13\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 56.\n\n35.\n\nOn January 22 and 23, 2008, Pequiven, Koch, Snamprogetti, the Company and the *Comandita* granted the requested waivers.14\n\n*Id.*,\u00b657.\n\n36.\n\nOn January 24, 2008, Gambrinus and Polar executed a share purchase agreement (the **\"Share Purchase Agreement\"** or the **\"2008 Transfer\").** Pursuant to clause THREE of the Share Purchase Agreement, Gambrinus would pay USD eighty million and one hundred dollars (USD 80,000,100.00) for Polar\u2019s 10% equity interest in Fertinitro \"at a future date following the granting of this document.\" On that same date, Sim\u00f3n Guevara, the Secretary of Fertinitro\u2019s Board, sent an email to Tony Parra, Koch-appointed Director, stating that the 2008 Transfer complied with the requirements under the purchase and financing documents, including Section 6.2 of the JIA.15\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 58.\n\n37.\n\nOn February 15, 2008, Gambrinus and Polar subscribed a common share subscription agreement (the **\"Common Share Subscription Agreement\").** In accordance with the terms of this agreement, Gambrinus issued 800,001 (eight hundred thousand and one) common shares in itself to Polar for an amount of USD 80,000,100.00. The Common Share Subscription Agreement further stipulated that \"as a result of the capitalization of the Subscription Amount by [Polar] in [Gambrinus], the account receivable that [Polar] has against [Gambrinus] is hereby extinguished.\" No cash was exchanged between Gambrinus and Polar for this transaction.16\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 59.\n\n38.\n\nOn October 11, 2010, Venezuela enacted Decree No. 7,713, which provided the forced acquisition of Fertinitro (the **\"Expropriation Decree\").17**\n\n*Id*.,\u00b675.\n\n39.\n\nOn November 8, 2011, Gambrinus filed before ICSID its Request for Arbitration against Venezuela.18\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 86.\n\n**B. The Parties\u2019 Arguments**\n-----------------------------\n\n40.\n\nIn Section V of the Award, the Tribunal addressed the jurisdictional objections raised by Respondent. Venezuela objected to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal *ratione personae, ratione temporis* and *ratione materiae,* under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the BIT alleging, *inter alia,* that (A) Gambrinus is not a protected foreign investor and Polar\u2019s use of Gambrinus\u2019 legal personality is an abuse of corporate personality; (B) the dispute pre-dates the \"interposition\" of Gambrinus in the corporate structure and/or was reasonably foreseeable at that time; and (C) Gambrinus made no investment, as it has not proved title to the Fertinitro shares and its purported interest is not an \"investment\" for purposes of the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n41.\n\nIn Section V.B. and V.C of the Award, the Tribunal analyzed and rejected the objections *ratione personae* and *ratione temporis* (A and B above), and in Section 5.D of the Award, the Tribunal addressed Respondent\u2019s *ratione materiae* objection, which is the sole object of the present annulment proceedings. A brief summary of the Parties\u2019 relevant arguments on the *ratione materiae* objection follows.\n\n42.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the detailed restrictions of the JIA regarding share transfers were the result of careful drafting and analysis given the importance of the Owners and their identity, each of whom had been carefully selected to participate in the Project. Any attempted transfer in violation of the restrictions of Section 6 would be null, void and legally ineffective. These restrictions equally applied to a transfer of shares to an affiliate. Although a \"Permitted Disposition\" under Section 6.2, a transfer to an affiliate would also be subject in any case to satisfaction of each of the conditions of Section 6.7, including the requirement that \"any Disposition shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalents to the exclusion of any other considerations.\" According to the Respondent, this condition would have assisted in ensuring, among other things, the solvency and economic standing of the transferee, the transparency as to the value of the disposition and the genuine character of the operation.19\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 250.\n\n43.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent pointed out that Articles 11 and 15 of the Fertinitro By-Laws contain a mirror validity requirement that all transfers be made \"in cash or cash equivalent to the exclusion of any other forms of consideration,\" and that any non-compliant disposition of interests would be null and void.20\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 208.\n\n44.\n\nThe Respondent further argued that Gambrinus did not make a payment in \"cash or cash equivalent.\" Instead, Polar and Gambrinus devised a \"share for share transaction.\"21 Under the Common Share Subscription Agreement, the amount owed by Polar for the subscription of the newly issued Gambrinus shares was set-off against the identical sum that Gambrinus owed to Polar under the Share Purchase Agreement. The Respondent argued that, under this arrangement, no funds were transferred from Gambrinus to Polar and that the issuance of the new shares could not be considered as payment in cash or having been made through a \"cash equivalent.\"22\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 209.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 212 and 213.\n\n45.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent argued that the 2008 Transfer was, in accordance with Section 6(1) of the JIA, null and void *ab initio,* which pursuant to Venezuelan law, has the same effect as non-existence. Accordingly, the 2008 Transfer never materialized, Gambrinus never acquired ownership of the shares in Fertinitro and it never became an owner under the terms of the JIA.23\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 215 and 217.\n\n46.\n\nFinally, the Respondent claimed that the 2008 Transfer was made in breach of the general principle under Venezuelan law of good faith, so that even if Gambrinus had actually acquired the ownership of Fertinitro shares, Gambrinus would nevertheless not be entitled to claim the BIT protection.2425\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 270.\n\nAs part of its jurisdictional objection *ratione materias,* Respondent also argued that, even if the Tribunal found that the 2008 Transfer was valid, Gambrinus would still not own a protected investment under the terms of the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Yet, having reached the conclusion that Gambrinus did not own the Fertinitro shares at the time of the alleged breach of the BIT, the Tribunal decided that it would not address Respondent\u2019s second argument.\n\n47.\n\nIn response, Gambrinus contended that there is no basis, either in the JIA or the Fertinitro By-Laws for challenging the 2008 Transfer. The 2008 Transfer was made in good faith, fully disclosed to all shareholders and accompanied by cash/cash equivalent consideration - namely, the obligation assumed by Gambrinus at the time of the transfer to pay Polar the sum of USD 80,000,100.26\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 226.\n\n48.\n\nApplicant argued that the \"set-off' of two matching cash equivalent obligations satisfies the cash equivalency requirement under Section 6(7) of the JIA and that, in any case, the cash equivalency transfer requirement of the JIA and the Fertinitro By-Laws did not apply to inter-affiliate transfers.27\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 231.\n\n49.\n\nRelying on the legal opinion of Mr. James Otis Rodner (the **\"Rodner Opinion\"),** Gambrinus argued that the requirement that the transfer be for cash or cash equivalent was to facilitate the \"right of first refusal.\" However, since no right of first refusal arises with respect to inter-affiliate transfers, there is no reason why the cash equivalency requirement should be applicable in such cases.28\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 232 and 251.\n\n50.\n\nAccording to the Rodner Opinion, to apply the cash equivalency requirement to any transfers between affiliates would lead to the absurd result of disallowing various \"Permitted Dispositions\" under Section 6.2, specifically inter-affiliate transfers pursuant to liquidation or merger under Section 6.2.2 or a share-for-share transfer under Section 6.2.1 since these Dispositions cannot be made \"exclusively\" for \"cash equivalent consideration\" as expressed by Section 6.7(i).29\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 243 and 252.\n\n51.\n\nGambrinus further contended that the Fertinitro By-Laws, far from being identical to the JIA as asserted by Respondent, actually state that inter-affiliate transfers may be made without complying with the \"cash equivalent\" requirement.30 According to the Rodner Opinion, under the Fertinitro By-Laws, the cash equivalent requirement under Article 14 for a shareholder\u2019s sale of its shares, applies with the express exclusion of the transactions mentioned in Article 12 regarding inter-affiliate transfers, such as the 2008 Transfer.31\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 253.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 254. Gambrinus also pointed out that neither the JIA nor the Fertinitro By-Laws require that the price set out for an inter-affiliate transfer be disclosed, nor is there a requirement to disclose the kind or extent of the payment, in contrast to third-party transfers under Section 6.4 of the JIA. See *Id.,* \u00b6 236.\n\n52.\n\nAlso on the basis of the Rodner Opinion, Gambrinus argued that contracts in Venezuela, as in many civil law countries, are interpreted taking into account the real intentions of the parties, avoiding absurd results and looking at the contract as a whole, meaning that one must not read individual provisions without relating them to the parties\u2019 intention when entering into the contract and to the remaining clauses in the contract.32\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 255.\n\n53.\n\nThe Rodner Opinion added that in civil law, including Venezuelan law, when the same parties enter into several contracts that deal with the same subject, if there is contradiction in the terms used in these contracts, the language of the later contract prevails over the language of the earlier contract. In accordance with this principle, Gambrinus argued that the terms of the Fertinitro By-Laws prevail over the terms of the JIA.\n\n54.\n\nFurthermore, Gambrinus contended that the Respondent cannot dispute Gambrinus\u2019 titles to the shares since, regardless of whether cash equivalence was satisfied, failure to satisfy this requirement: (i) does not, under Venezuelan law, lead to absolute nullity,33 and (ii) cannot divest the Tribunal of jurisdiction under the Treaty since \"no fundamental principle of morality,\" \"public policy\" or \"illegality\" is implicated here.34\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 239.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 240 and 241.\n\n55.\n\nIn reply to Gambrinus\u2019 argument that the real intention of the parties was not to apply the cash equivalency requirement to inter-affiliate transfers, the Respondent pointed out, *inter alia,* that Section 6.7 of the JIA does not deal with pre-emption rights and therefore situations of pre-emption cannot have been the reason for including the cash or cash equivalent requirement.35 The Respondent further argued that, had the parties wished to exclude inter-affiliate transfers from the cash or cash equivalent requirement, they could easily have done so, as tribunals are not supposed to rewrite the parties\u2019 agreement by resorting to rules of interpretation that are applicable in case of obscurity, ambiguities or deficiencies in the parties\u2019 intention, which is not the present case.36\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 258.\n\n*Id.*,\u00b6 257.\n\n**C. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis on the** ***Ra tione Materiae*** **Objection**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nAs mentioned above, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent\u2019s objections *ratione personae* and *ratione temporis,* but upheld the Respondent\u2019s *ratione materiae* objection, which is the sole object of the present annulment proceedings. Thus, the following summary of the Tribunal\u2019s analysis will exclusively deal with the *ratione materiae* objection.\n\n57.\n\nThe Tribunal analyzed Article VI of the JIA and noted that the terms of Section 6.2 of the JIA make any disposition of shares, including transfers to affiliates, subject to the condition of \"cash or cash equivalents\" consideration under Section 6.7(i).\n\n58.\n\nThe Tribunal also found that, pursuant to Section 2.1 of the JIA, to the extent that the terms of the Fertinitro By-Laws conflict with the terms of the JIA, the terms of the latter prevail.37\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 261.\n\n59.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal analyzed the Fertinitro By-Laws and noted that, in accordance with the last part of Article 14 of the Fertinitro By-Laws, any disposal or transfer of shares must comply with the provisions contained in the JIA. Thus, the Tribunal concluded that also under the Fertinitro By-Laws, transfers of shares to affiliates are subject for their validity to the condition of payment being made in cash or cash equivalent, as provided by Section 6(7)(i) of the JIA.\n\n60.\n\nThe Tribunal further noted that both Parties and their legal experts had made reference to Article 12 of the Venezuelan Code of Civil Procedure, according to which:38\n\n*En la interpretaci\u00f3n de contratos o actos que presenten oscuridad, ambig\u00fcedad o deficiencia, los jueces se atendr\u00e1n al prop\u00f3sito y ala intenci\u00f3n de las partes o de los otorgantes, teniendo en mira las exigencias de la Ley, de la verdad y de la buena fe.*\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 265.\n\n61.\n\nThe Tribunal found that this provision means that under Venezuelan law the intention of the parties will only take precedence over the contract language when there is \"obscurity, ambiguity or deficiency.\"39 In this regard, the Tribunal also held that there is no \"obscurity, ambiguity or deficiency\" in the provisions of the JIA regulating the transfer of shares, including with regard to the condition under Section 6.7(i) that any transfer, including transfers to affiliates, such as the 2008 Transfer, \"be made for cash or cash equivalents.\"40\n\n*Id*.,\u00b6265.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 266.\n\n62.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal concluded that it was not supposed to \"modify\" or \"rewrite\" the JIA \"merely because one might believe that requiring the application of this condition also in case of inter-affiliate transfers would serve no useful purpose,\"41 or \"only because it is reasonable to think that the real purpose of that condition is to permit the exercise of the right of first refusal of the other shareholders.\"42\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 266.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 267. In this same paragraph, the Tribunal adds that, \"[b]y the same token, [it] should not rewrite the parties\u2019 agreement because otherwise the condition of a 'cash or cash equivalent' consideration under Section 6.7(i) would not permit implementing some of the Permitted Dispositions under Section 6.2 of the JIA.\"\n\n63.\n\nThe Tribunal was comforted in its conclusion by the statement of Polar in its letter of January 21, 2008 to the other Owners stating that the 2008 Transfer would take place \"in compliance with Sections 6.2.2 and 6.7 of the [JIA] and Section 12(b) of the [Fertinitro By-Laws].\"43\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 268.\n\n64.\n\nFurther, the Tribunal agreed with Respondent that the Common Share Subscription Agreement established a share-for-share payment and that such payment for the Fertinitro shares did not comply with the cash equivalency requirement under Section 6.7 of the JIA, since the Gambrinus shares are not \"an immediately realizable liquid asset,\" Gambrinus not being traded publicly.44\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 269.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal determined that the cash equivalency requirement under Section 6.7(i) of the JIA was considered by the parties to the JIA to be an essential element of the contract, given the seriousness of the sanction that had been agreed in case of breach of such condition - the \"nullity\" and the \"no force of effect\" of the purported transfer.45\n\n*Id*.,\u00b6272.\n\n66.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal determined that the 2008 Transfer may not be given effect in the present case.46 Accordingly, the Tribunal concluded that Gambrinus owned no investment at the time of the alleged expropriation of Fertinitro, due to the Share Purchase Agreement being of no force and effect. \"Having made no investment which may fall within the BIT protection, [Gambrinus'] claim is not subject to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction which, accordingly, must be declined.\"47\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 273. According to paragraph 274 of the Award, this conclusion dispenses the Tribunal from dealing with Respondent\u2019s subordinate claim whereby, since the investment was not made in good faith, it should in any case be denied protection. Yet, the Tribunal adds that, \"[f]or what may be of relevance in the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that [Gambrinus] did not act in breach of the [sic] good faith, its conduct being rather motivated by an erroneous interpretation of the relevant provisions of the JIA and the By-Laws.\"\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 276.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. The Applicant\u2019s Position**\n-------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nAs mentioned above, Gambrinus seeks annulment of the Award on three of the five grounds set forth in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention: (i) that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers; (ii) that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; and (iii) that the Award failed to state the reasons on which it is based.\n\n68.\n\nBelow is a summary of Gambrinus\u2019 arguments:\n\n**(1) The Relevant Standards of Review**\n----------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nCiting the annulment decision in *Sempra v. Argentina,48* the Applicant argues that, when interpreting the grounds for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, the Committee should not apply neither a narrow nor a broad approach, nor a presumption in favour of the Award\u2019s validity.49\n\n*Sempra Energy Int'l* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2010 *[\"Sempra\"]* **(AL-005).**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 150 and 151.\n\n70.\n\nWith regards to the annulment ground based on a tribunal\u2019s \"manifest excess of powers\" (Article 52(1)(b)), the Applicant states that an excess of jurisdiction, or a failure to exercise jurisdiction where it actually exists, is a \"paradigm form of excess of powers.\"50\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 152.\n\n71.\n\nThe Applicant contends that in order for the excess to be \"manifest,\" an error need not be obvious on its face. Instead, in some cases, extensive argumentation and analysis may be required.51\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 153. In this regard, Applicant cites *Caratube Int'l Oil Co.* v. *Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/12, Decision on Annulment, February 21, 2014 *[\"Caratube\"]* **(AL-020)** and *Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Occidental Exploration and Prod. Co.* v. *Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Decision on Annulment, November 2, 2015 *[\"Occidental\"]* **(AL-022).**\n\n72.\n\nThe Applicant points out that a manifest excess of powers may also occur when a tribunal fails to apply the relevant law, and argues that although a mere misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law will not suffice, a \"gross or egregious error of law, acknowledged as such by any reasonable person, could be construed to amount to a failure to apply the proper law, and could give rise to the possibility of annulment.\"52\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 155. In support of this, Applicant cites *Caratube* **(AL-020),** *Sempra* **(AL-005)** and *AES Summit Generation Ltd. and AES-Tisza Eromu Kft* v. *Hungary,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2012 *[\"AES Summit\"]* **(AL-0024).**\n\n73.\n\nMoreover, the Applicant argues that when the ground for annulment is based on a jurisdictional excess of power, the committee must apply a more rigorous approach and undertake a \"searching inquiry.\"53 If a committee finds that the tribunal did not conduct a \"properly analysis\" of a jurisdictional issue, such failure constitutes an annullable error.54 The Applicant supports this argument on the recent annulment decision in *Venezuela Holdings,* in which the committee accepted that \"there is some force in the argument advanced by Venezuela [which in that annulment proceeding was the applicant] that matters of jurisdiction may call for a more rigorous approach than other grounds for annulment, simply because a tribunal ought not to be allowed to exercise a judicial power it does not have (or vice versa).\"55\n\nTr. 2017, Day 2, 270:14-15.\n\nApplicant\u2019s letter of April 24, 2017.\n\n*Venezuela Holdings* **(AL-066) \u00b6** 110. According to this same \u00b6 110: \"It is plain on the face of it that the reference in Article 52(1)(b) to a tribunal having \"manifestly exceeded its powers\" fits most naturally into the context of jurisdiction, in the sense that it covers the case where a tribunal exercises a judicial power which on a proper analysis had not been conferred on it (or vice versa declines to exercise a jurisdiction which it did possess).\"\n\n74.\n\nAs to the annulment ground based on the Tribunal\u2019s \"failure to state the reasons\" (Article 52(1)(e)), the Applicant argues that an award will be annullable \"as long as there is no express rationale for the conclusions with respect to a pivotal or outcome-determinative point.\"56 In addition, the Applicant contends that, as established by the annulment committee *in MINE* v. *Guinea,57* an award will also be annullable when the Tribunal offers \"inconsistent reasons or frivolous reasons.\"58\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 157. In support of this argument, the Applicant cites *Victor Pey Casado and Foundation Presidente Allende* v. *Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on Annulment, December 18, 2012 *[\"Pey Casado\"]* **(AL-016),** as well as *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Decision on Annulment, July 3, 2002 *[\"Vivendi* *I*\"] **(AL-025).**\n\n*Maritime Int'l Nominees Establishment* v. *Gov't of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/84/4, Decision on Annulment, December 22, 1989 *[\"MINE\"]* **(AL-006).**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 158.\n\n75.\n\nCiting the annulment decision in *TECO* v. *Guatemala,59* the Applicant argues that the award must be annulled where \"the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning is not clear at all,\" i.e., where \"the Committee, despite having the benefit of the Parties\u2019 submissions and of the entire record before it, has struggled to understand the Tribunal\u2019s line of reasoning,\" or where there is a '\"complete absence of any discussion of the Parties\u2019 [submissions] within the Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the' overarching claim or defense.\"60\n\n*TECO Guatemala Holdings LLC* v. *Republic of Guatemala,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23, Decision on Annulment, April 5, 2016 [\"TECO\"] **(AL-027).**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 159.\n\n76.\n\nIn particular, on the basis of the annulment decision in *Venezuela Holdings,* the Applicant argues that a tribunal\u2019s failure to address relevant principles of the applicable law concerning existence and scope of property rights constitutes a failure to state the reason under Article 52(1)(e) as well as a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b).61\n\nSee Applicant\u2019s letter of April 24, 2017. The Applicant refers to *Venezuela Holdings* **(AL-066), \u00b6\u00b6** 166 and 187.\n\n77.\n\nWith regards to the annulment ground based on a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)), the Applicant highlights that the object and purpose of this ground is to protect the integrity of the arbitral procedure,62 and that an award will only be annullable on this basis when the relevant rule of procedure is \"fundamental,\" that is, \"when it 'concerns a rule of natural justice' i.e., is 'concerned with the essential fairness of the proceeding.'\"63\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 160. In support of this argument, the Applicant cites *Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Servs. Worldwide* v. *Republic of Phillipines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/3/25, Decision on Annulment, December 23, 2010 *[\"Fraport Annulment\"]* **(AL-008);** *Alapli Elektrik B. V.* v. *Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/13, Decision on Annulment, July 10, 2010 *[\"Alapli\"]* **(AL-010);** and *CDC Group Plc.* v. *Republic of Seychelles,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/14, Decision on Annulment, June 29, 2005 *[\"CDC Group\"]* **(AL-0009).**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 162.\n\n78.\n\nCiting *Fraport,64 Amco II,65 Alapli66* and *Pey Casado,67* the Applicant states that such fundamental rules of procedure comprise the right to procedural equality and the right to be heard, which also includes the right to have a meaningful opportunity to rebut a new argument or claim.68 In addition, and on the basis of the annulment decisions in *Caratube*,69 and *TECO,70* the Applicant also contends that, the failure to properly apportion the burden of proof between the parties may, in certain circumstances constitute a breach of a fundamental rule of procedure.71\n\n*Fraport Annulment* **(AL-008), \u00b6** 200.\n\n*Amco Asia Corp. et. al.* v. *Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Annulment, December 17, 1992 *[\"Amco If']* **(AL-007), \u00b6** 9.08.\n\n*Alapli* **(AL-010), \u00b6** 131.\n\n*Pey Casado* **(AL-016), \u00b6** 184.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 232 to 237.

See also Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6106 to 108.\n\n80.\n\nFinally, the Applicant argues that in contrast with the other grounds for annulment, Article 52(1)(d) encompasses \"not only procedural breaches committed by the Tribunal, but also those committed by other actors, such as the parties [...] or their counsel.\"74\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 161.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Manifest Excess of Powers and the Award\u2019s Failure to State the Reasons upon which it is based**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n81.\n\nGambrinus argues that the Tribunal committed \"annullable errors\" that constitute a manifest excess of power under Article 52(1)(b) and/or a failure to state the reasons under Article 52(1)(e) in six (6) different ways: (i) in its treatment of the 2008 Transfer as being void *ab initio-,* (ii) in its application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate transfers; (iii) in its conclusion on whether the 2008 Transfer involved cash/cash-consideration; (iv) in its conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription Agreement; (v) in its failure to address and apply the 5-year prescription period and (vi) in its failure to apply and address relevant international law.\n\n***a. The Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the 2008 Transfer as being void*** **ab initio**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nGambrinus argues that, under Venezuelan law, a contractual transaction can only be viewed as absolutely null and void if it fails to satisfy very basic conditions *(e.g.,* if a contract was signed by someone lacking basic capacity to consent) and a lawful end, and if it violates an absolute norm of public policy.75 According to the Applicant, this is supported by the Rodner Opinion, which is in turn supported by fourteen exhibits and references to Venezuelan law and legal authorities.76\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 165.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 165.\n\n83.\n\nIn this sense, Gambrinus further argues that under Venezuelan law, the non-adherence to a technical legal condition of transfer - a condition that was fully capable of being waived, such as the cash equivalency requirement under Section 6.7 of the JIA - cannot make that transfer null and void *ab initio.77* At the most, that transfer would only be *potentially* capable of being invalidated at the suit of a contract counterparty having standing to seek such relief (relative nullity), and until such a time that a competent court has declared that transfer null, the transfer would remain valid and have full effect.78\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 166 and 169. The Applicant further argues that the Award \"fails to take account of the principle, explained by Mr. Rodner, that a transaction cannot be regarded as 'inexistent' based upon the contractual condition that was capable of being waived, particularly where that [sic] the shareholders had confirmed the shareholding.\" Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 48.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 167 to 169. In support of its argument regarding the need of a declaration of nullity from a competent tribunal, the Applicant cites the expert opinion of Prof. Iribarren in another ICSID arbitration, *Crystallex Int'l Corp.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/11/2, Award, April 4, 2016 *[\"Crystallex\"]* **(AL-018).** In such case Prof. Iribarren acted as legal expert for Venezuela.\n\n84.\n\nBased on the above, the Applicant argues that the 2008 Transfer must be regarded as real and extant from the moment of the Share Purchase Agreement and that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by refusing to recognize Gambrinus\u2019 investment on the basis of Article VI of the JIA.79\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 170 and 171.\n\n85.\n\nThe Applicant supports its position on the annulment decision in *Occidental v. Ecuador,80* which, according to Gambrinus, \"bears striking parallels to the present case.\"81 For the Applicant, the *Occidental* v. *Ecuador* annulment decision shows that in a civil law system like Venezuela or Ecuador, the violation of a transfer restriction - such as the cash equivalency requirement in this case - does not result in nullity *ab initio,* even if the restriction declares non-conforming transfers to be null. Instead, in such circumstances, a tribunal must treat the transfer as valid and to do otherwise would constitute a manifest excess of jurisdiction.82\n\n*Occidental* **(AL-022).**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 172.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 175. See also Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 36 to 44. The Applicant maintains that on this point Ecuadorian law and Venezuelan law are in full harmony (Reply on Annulment, \u00b642):  \n (a) Both Ecuadorian and Venezuelan law have different classes of \"nullity,\" namely, inexistence, absolute nullity and relative nullity; these are separately delineated.  \n (b) Thus, under both Ecuadorian and Venezuelan law, a failure to meet certain fundamental conditions for the existence of a contract leads to inexistence, and a failure to satisfy certain conditions as demanded by fundamental public policy leads to absolute nullity.  \n (c) Under both Ecuadorian and Venezuelan law, when an alleged pre-condition to a contract or legal act is capable of being waived by the party in whose interest it is made, and/or ratified, then the contract or legal act is only subject to \"relative nullity\" i.e., it is operative, and it is not null and void until and unless a party with standing obtains a declaration of nullity from a competent tribunal.\n\n86.\n\nAdditionally, the Applicant argues that a corollary error committed by the Tribunal in this case (and as further illustrated by *Occidental v. Ecuador)* was that it assumed, without proper foundation, that it actually possessed jurisdiction to declare the investment nonexistent, while in fact only a properly constituted tribunal, having jurisdiction under the JIA and Fertinitro By-Laws, had such power.83\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 176. The Applicant argues that the *Occidental* **(AL-022)** annulment decision \"underscores that an excess of powers occurs, and that excess is manifest, when an ICSID tribunal declares as inexistent or null an event that was not inexistent or null (and which could only have been declared so by a different tribunal) especially when such a declaration is contrary to the position taken by the parties who would have had standing. It bears emphasis that a lawsuit seeking such a declaration would be a matter for Fertinitro\u2019s shareholders and creditors - who consented to and benefited from Gambrinus\u2019 role as a shareholder - to litigate.\" Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 44.\n\n87.\n\nFinally, the Applicant claims that the Tribunal\u2019s excess of powers was \"manifest\" since applicable Venezuelan law had been articulated in the record and it was undisputed that the JIA was subject to Venezuelan law, including the distinction between relative and absolute nullity.84 In response to Respondent\u2019s contention that the issue of absolute versus relative nullity was never raised before the Tribunal, the Applicant notes that the argument was squarely raised in (i) its July 21, 2014 submission (the **\"July 2014 Submission\");85** (ii) Rodner\u2019s Opinion of the same date,86 \"which formed an integral part of Gambrinus\u2019 submissions;\"87 and Gambrinus\u2019 September 26, 2014 post-hearing reply (the **\"2014 PostHearing Reply \").88**\n\n*Id*., \u00b6 177.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Response to Respondent\u2019s New Argument and May 16 Submission dated July 21, 2014, \u00b6 47 footnote 66 **(A-53).**\n\nLegal Opinion on Venezuelan Law of James Otis Rodner, July 18,2014 [the \"Rodner Opinion\"] **(A-54), \u00b6\u00b6** 21, 42, 43,44, 45,80 and 81.\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 31.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Post-Hearing Reply of September 26, 2014, \u00b6 22 (A-57).

The Tribunal\u2019s application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate transfers***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Tribunal acknowledged that the text of Article VI of the JIA contained obscurities, ambiguities, or deficiencies that would lead to illogical results never contemplated by the parties to the JIA.89\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 179.\n\n89.\n\nFor instance, according to the Applicant, the Tribunal agreed with Gambrinus that the application of the cash equivalency requirement in Section 6.7(i) to the \"Permitted Disposition\" in Section 6.2 would render most of those dispositions literally impossible.90 The Tribunal also \"explicitly\" found that the cash equivalency requirement served no purpose for inter-affiliate or other \"Permitted Dispositions\" under the JIA.91 Additionally, the Tribunal acknowledged that \"the cash equivalency provisions in the [Fertinitro] ByLaws did not so clearly apply to inter-affiliate transfers.\"92\n\n*Id.*, \u00b6 179.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 185.

See also Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 60 to 63.\n\n90.\n\nThe Applicant argues that, faced with such obscurities, ambiguities or deficiencies, Venezuelan law mandated that the Tribunal give effect to the actual intent of the parties in the JIA - which would have led to the conclusion that the cash equivalency requirement did not apply to inter-affiliate transfers - and that the Tribunal failed to do so.93\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 182 and 186. Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 58 and 59.\n\n91.\n\nFor the Applicant, this omission is particularly telling given: (i) \"the evidence that Fertinitro\u2019s Corporate Secretary and the Company\u2019s lawyers, David Polk & Wardwell (who drafted the JIA), knew about the inter-affiliate transfer [...] and yet made no inquiry whatsoever concerning the 'consideration' being paid for the transfer;\" and (ii) the shareholders\u2019 post-acquisition conduct, which \"not only accepted Gambrinus as a shareholder but relied on Gambrinus\u2019 contractual obligations.\"94\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 187. In this sense, the Applicant also claims that the Award failed to consider, for example, that the post-acquisition conduct of the shareholders, by application of the doctrine of good faith, also provided a separate basis for finding that the cash equivalency requirement did not apply to the 2008 Transfer.\n\n92.\n\nIn view of this omission, the Applicant concludes that the Tribunal committed two annullable errors: first, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers, and second, the Award failed to state the reasons upon which it is based.95\n\nAV, \u00b6 188.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion on whether the 2008 Transfer involved cash/cash-consideration***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nThe Applicant argues that, even assuming that the Tribunal was correct in applying the cash equivalency requirement to inter-affiliate transfers, its analysis of whether the 2008 Transfer actually met such requirement incurred an \"annullable error.\"\n\n94.\n\nIn particular, the Applicant contends that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the cash equivalency requirement was not met because Gambrinus\u2019 shares were not \"an immediately realizable liquid asset\" was based only on the International Accounting Standard 7 **(\"IAS 7\")** which was introduced into the record by the Respondent without seeking prior permission in breach of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2.96\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 116. Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 69.\n\n95.\n\nInstead, the Tribunal should have based its analysis on Venezuelan law under which -according to the Rodner\u2019s Opinion - a set-off of monetary obligations would comply with the cash equivalency requirement provided under Section 6.7(i) of the JIA.\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, by relying only on the IAS 7 and failing to apply Venezuelan law of set-off to the transaction, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.97\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 196. See also Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 65 to 68.\n\n97.\n\nFurthermore, citing the annulment decision in *TECO* v. *Guatemala,98* the Applicant argues that by failing to explain why the law of set-off could not apply or why Mr. Rodner\u2019s analysis could not be accepted, the Award failed to state the reasons upon which it is based.99\n\n*TECO* **(AL-027).**\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 197.\n\n***d. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription Agreement***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Tribunal\u2019s holding that the Common Share Subscription Agreement had the effect of \"converting\" the transaction \"into a share-for-share payment\" represents a further annullable error.100\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 199.\n\n99.\n\nThe Applicant contends that, while the Tribunal applied a strict literalist approach to the JIA, it applied a non-textual approach when it construed the Common Share Subscription Agreement \"as 'converting' the terms of the January 2008 Share Purchase Agreement into an agreement to engage in a share-for-share transaction.\"101\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 200 and 201.\n\n100.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, if a strict textual reading of the Share Transfer Agreement and the Common Share Subscription Agreement had also been taken, this same approach would inevitably have led to the conclusion that the cash equivalency requirement was satisfied, since the Share Purchase Agreement created a money obligation payable in cash which was discharged when Polar assumed a matching and offsetting cash payment obligation to Gambrinus by virtue of the share subscription.102\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 200.\n\n101.\n\nThe Award\u2019s failure to reconcile these different approaches leads to an unexplained inconsistency in its treatment of the cash equivalency requirement which represents a failure to state the reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, as well as a manifest excess of powers of the Tribunal under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n***e. The Tribunal\u2019s failure to address and apply the 5-year prescription period***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Award never addressed the effect of the 5-year prescription period for declaring nullity in Venezuelan law, which the Respondent\u2019s own legal expert acknowledged would have been applicable to any action for annulment of the 2008 Transfer.103 For the Applicant, the Tribunal\u2019s failure \"to address the prescription period and to apply its finding of good faith to the prescription period under Venezuelan law,\" represents a failure to give reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention as well as a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.104\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 204.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 206.\n\n103.\n\nIn response to the Respondent\u2019s contention that the 5-year prescription period was never raised by Gambrinus before the Tribunal, the Applicant notes that the issue was raised (i) in footnote no. 57 of its July 2014 Submission in response to the Respondent\u2019s legal expert, Dr. Garcia Montoya,105 and (ii) in the Rodner Opinion.106107\n\nJuly 2014 Submission, \u00b6 47, footnote no. 57 **(A-53).** The Applicant argues that the Respondent\u2019s legal expert, Dr. Garcia Montoya, agreed that an application for nullity was subject to a prescription period of 5 years. In fact, the Applicant contends that both Mr. Rodner and Dr. Garcia Montoya agreed that Venezuelan law establishes a distinction between relative versus absolute nullity. Furthermore, the Applicant argues that the legal authorities submitted by both legal experts on this issue are all in accord. See Reply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 75 and 76.\n\nRodner Opinion, \u00b6 43 **(A-54).**\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 71 to 73.\n\n104.\n\nMoreover, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal also failed to consider the impact of the 5-year prescription period established in the Fertinitro By-Laws themselves and that this failure also constitutes both a failure to give reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, as well as a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.108\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 207.\n\n***f. The Tribunal\u2019s failure to apply and address relevant international law***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n105.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, the Tribunal failed to address the argument made by Gambrinus during the arbitration proceedings that international legal principles clearly hold that jurisdiction should not be denied on the basis of a minor, non-prejudicial noncompliance with contractual or regulatory provisions, such as the cash equivalency requirement set forth in Section 6.7(i) of the JIA.109 In support of this argument, the Applicant cited *Rumeli Telekom A.S.* v. *Kazakhstan)110 Tokios Tokeles v.

Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 82.\n\n107.\n\nThe Applicant further argues that the Tribunal\u2019s failure to apply the said international legal principles constitutes a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention and that the absence of any discussion of this issue in the Award constitutes a failure to give reasons under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.115\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 210 and 211. The Applicant further argues that the Tribunal also failed to address the legal consequences that under Venezuelan and international law emerged from the fact that all of the other shareholders consented to and benefited from the 2008 Transfer. For the Applicant, these facts \"compelled the conclusion that, by application of good faith *[actos propios),* Venezuela was precluded from denying Gambrinus\u2019 status as shareholder.\" Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 83.\n\n**(3) Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n108.\n\nThe Applicant also requests that the Award be annulled on the ground that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention).\n\n109.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the Respondent was allowed to raise an allegedly entirely new defense (the issue of whether or not the 2008 Transfer complied with the JIA\u2019s cash equivalency requirement, hereinafter the **\"JIA Defense\")** during the first day of the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits (the **\"Arbitration Hearing\"),** that is, after the closure of the written phase of the proceedings, and in violation of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1116\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 112. In particular, the Applicant refers to Sections 13.9 and 13.10 of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1 of 23 July 2012, according to which: \"13.9. The Parties have agreed to include with their written submissions (i.e., memorials, counter-memorials, replies and rejoinders) not only their legal arguments, but also all the evidence on which they rely for the legal and factual positions advanced therein, including written witness testimony, any expert testimony, documents and all other evidence in whatever form [... ] 13.10. Replies and rejoinders shall respond strictly to the prior submission filed by the other Party and shall not raise new issues. The Parties shall not be permitted to supplement their written submissions without authorization of the Tribunal.\" The Applicant notes that the Tribunal itself held, in its Procedural Order No. 2, that Respondent\u2019s JIA Defense was a new argument not allowed under Section 13.9 of Procedural Order No. 1. Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 20.\n\n110.\n\nThe Applicant argues that the timing of the Respondent\u2019s JIA Defense \"was not accidental,\" but a \"deliberate ambush\" \"timed to obtain maximum surprise\" and \"strategic advantage,\"117 that ultimately resulted in \"a fundamentally imbalanced oral procedure, in which [Gambrinus] was not able to prepare to argue the one point that was to prove dispositive.\"118 Furthermore, according to the Applicant, although the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2 attempted to give Gambrinus an opportunity to argue the issue, \"it is all too clear that these procedures were fundamentally inadequate.\"119\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 223\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 212. In response to the Respondent\u2019s claim that it only became aware of the facts about the transfer when it reviewed Gambrinus\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction in January 2014, the Applicant contends that Gambrinus had disclosed full copies of the January 2008 Share Purchase Agreement and the February 2008 Share Subscription Agreement by the time it filed its Reply on August 30, 2013, that is, 7 months prior to the hearing. Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 25.\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 212.\n\n111.\n\nFor the Applicant, the untimely introduction of this new jurisdictional objection deprived Gambrinus of its right to participate effectively in the oral phase of the Arbitration Hearing. In particular, the Applicant contends that the Respondent\u2019s \"ambush tactics\" created the following fundamental imbalances during the oral procedure:\n\n\u2022 An imbalance in the opening: Gambrinus\u2019 counsel presented opening submissions based solely upon the case as pleaded in written submissions while Respondent\u2019s counsel unveiled its new defense.120\n\n\u2022 An imbalance in testimony on Day 2: Gambrinus\u2019 witness, Mr. Gabald\u00f3n, was cross-examined on the JIA Defense on Day 2 of the Arbitration Hearing, while Gambrinus\u2019 counsel was not in a position to adduce testimony from him on the issue.121\n\n\u2022 Further testimonial imbalances: Gambrinus\u2019 decision not to call Mr. Haberman and Dr. Garcia Montoya \"was predicated, *inter alia,* on the jurisdictional and merits arguments as then pled by Respondent\" and therefore Gambrinus did not cross-examine them on the opinions they had and would render with respect to the JIA Defense.122\n\n\u2022 An imbalance in the closing arguments: \"Gambrinus\u2019 counsel had not had the opportunity to research and marshal their arguments on the JIA/cash equivalency point.\"123\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 218.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 219.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 220.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 222. The Applicant argues that the untimely introduction of the JIA Defense also created an imbalance in the disclosure phase of the proceedings, since it \"foreclosed any hope of getting disclosure on this key issue.\" *Id., \u00b6* 221.\n\n112.\n\nThe Applicant contends that all of these imbalances led to an impairment of the decision making process that was not redressed or cured by the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2, which attempted to give Gambrinus an opportunity to address the JIA Defense, \"albeit with constraints of a page-limited brief and single expert opinion.\"124 In this regard, the Applicant argues that the \"damage\" to the decision making-process is manifested in the fact that Gambrinus\u2019 post-hearing submissions on the JIA Defense did not receive \"the same level of attention as Respondent\u2019s oral submissions and slide presentations\"125 and in the fact that numerous arguments contained in its post-hearing submissions \"were not subject of substantive deliberations\"126 or were simply ignored.127\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 225 and 226.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 227.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 227.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 228. *Inter alia,* the Applicant points out that the Award failed to address the correspondence by Fertinitro\u2019s Secretary, Mr. Guevara, which proved that the 2008 Transfer complied in all respects with the JIA and that the shareholders routinely demonstrated their acceptance of Gambrinus\u2019 shareholding. Reply on Annulment, \u00b6 102.\n\n113.\n\nOn this basis, the Applicant concludes that the imbalances led to a manifest and serious violation of Gambrinus\u2019 fundamental right to procedural equality and right to be heard,128 and that the Tribunal\u2019s failure to address numerous potentially dispositive points of law and fact (particularly those identified in the Rodner Opinion), constituted a failure to properly apportion the burden of proof which also constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.129\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 238.\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 239 and 240.\n\n114.\n\nFinally, in response to the Respondent\u2019s argument that Gambrinus agreed to the procedures set forth by the Tribunal to address the JIA Defense and therefore waived its right to challenge the Award on this basis, the Applicant contends that Gambrinus \"consistently opposed the admission of the new defense.\"130 For the Applicant, the fact that Gambrinus agreed to the timetable for the post-hearing briefs, after its objections to the admissibility of the JIA Defense had been overruled, cannot be considered a waiver of the original objection.131\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 89 to 98.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 99.\n\n**B. The Respondent\u2019s Position**\n--------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Gambrinus is attempting to use the annulment mechanism as an appeal procedure against the Award132 and requests that the Committee dismiss Gambrinus\u2019 Application in its entirety.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 2.\n\n116.\n\nBelow is a summary of the Respondent\u2019s arguments:\n\n**(1) Relevant Standards of Review**\n------------------------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe Respondent highlights that the annulment remedy under the ICSID Convention is not an appeal. It is an \"exceptional\" or extraordinary remedy for \"unusual and important\" cases, which does not allow to review an award on the merits, but only under the five limited grounds listed in Article 52(1) of the ICSID Convention.133 In support of this, the Respondent cites Prof. Schreuer134 and the annulment decisions in *MINE* v. *Guinea,135 TECO* v. *Guatemala136* and *RSM* v. *Grenada.137*\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 149 to 153.\n\nSchreuer *et al., The ICSID Convention: A Commentary* (2nd ed. 2009), p. 901 at \u00b6 11 **(DL-2).**\n\n*MINE* **(AL-006), \u00b6** 4.04.\n\n*TECO* **(AL-027), \u00b6** 73.\n\n*RSM Prod.

Citing the Centre\u2019s *Updated Background Paper on Annulment for the Administrative Council of ICSID,* May 5, 2016, \u00b6 68 **(DL-5), \u00b6** 68.\n\n119.\n\nCiting the annulment decisions in *El Paso v. Argentina139* and *Sempra* v. *Argentina,*140 the Respondent notes that the annulment ground based on a \"manifest excess of power\" (Article 52(1)(b)) requires that the excess be \"obvious, evident, clear, self-evident and extremely serious,\" as well as \"quite evident without the need to engage in an elaborate analysis of the text of the Award.\"141 Furthermore, contrary to what is suggested by the Applicant, the Respondent argues that this requirement is applicable irrespective of whether the tribunal\u2019s decision is on the merits or on jurisdiction and cites, among others, the annulment decision in *Total* v. *Argentina.142*\n\n*El Paso Energy Int'l Co. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Decision on the Application for Annulment, September 22, 2014 [\"El *Paso\"]* **(DL-8),\u00b6** 142.\n\n*Sempra* **(AL-005), \u00b6** 213.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 168.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 258 - 261, citing *Total S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/04/01, Decision on Annulment, February 1, 2016 *[\"Total\"]* **(DL-1), \u00b6\u00b6** 241-242. See also Tr. 2017, Day 1, 223:22-225:11 and Day 2, 338:6-22.\n\n120.\n\nIn addition, in relation to the failure to apply the relevant law, the Respondent contends that misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law, even if serious, does not justify annulment.143 Furthermore, according to the Respondent, the distinction between failure to apply the proper law and a misapplication or misinterpretation of the law is well-established and has been recognized by a clear line of *ad hoc* committee decisions.144 Relying on *Continental Casualty* v. *Argentina,145* the Respondent adds that it is for the Tribunal, not *the ad hoc* Committee, to determine the relevant provisions of the applicable law, their content, their relevance and their legal effect and a tribunal\u2019s decision on such issues cannot amount to a manifest excess of power.146\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 169.\n\nSee for example, *MINE* **(AL-006), \u00b6** 5.04: \"Disregard of the applicable rules of law must be distinguished from erroneous application of those rules which, even if manifestly unwarranted, furnishes no ground for annulment;\" *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki* v. *United Arab Emirates,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/7, Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee, June 5, 2007 *[\"Soufraki\"]* **(DL-7), \u00b6** 85: \"[...] *a distinction must be made between the failure to apply the proper law, which can result in annulment, and an error in the application of the law, which is not a ground for annulment',\" Occidental,* \u00b6 56: *\"Misinterpretation or misapplication of the proper law to be applied to the merits, even if serious, does not justify annulment;\" TECO* **(AL-027), \u00b6** 80 : \"[...] *when determining whether a tribunal failed to apply the applicable law, an annulment committee must determine whether that tribunal correctly identified the applicable law and whether it endeavored to apply it to the facts in dispute. Whether or not the tribunal made an error in the application of that law is beside the point.\"* In this regard, the Respondent highlights *El Paso* \u00b6 144, in which the Committee held: \"[I]t *is necessary to distinguish between the failure to apply the proper law and an error in the application of that law. The first is a ground for annulment under Article 52, the second is not. Reviewing the substantive reasoning by which an arbitral tribunal reached its conclusions would require reexamining how the tribunal applied or interpreted the law, which would transform annulment committees into appellate tribunals. Under this scenario, committees would necessarily have to evaluate the facts and the evidence as well as the legal principles put forward by the parties all of which were already analyzed by the respective arbitration tribunal. This would change the very nature of the ICSID arbitration system.\"*\n\n*Continental Casualty Co.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Decision on the Application for Partial Annulment of Continental Casualty Company and the Application for Partial Annulment of the Argentine Republic, September 16, 2011 *[\"Continental Casualty\"]* **(DL-19), \u00b6** 91.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 249.\n\n121.\n\nAs for the annulment ground based on the Tribunal\u2019s failure to state the reasons upon which the award is based (Article 52(1)(e)), the Respondent cites the annulment decision in *MINE* v. *Guinea147* according to which, this ground does not apply \"as long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or law.\"148 Citing *Wena* v. *Egypt,149* the Respondent further argues that this ground does not allow an *ad hoc* committee to \"reconsider whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not.\"150\n\n*MINE* **(AL-006), \u00b6** 5.09.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 163.\n\n*Wena Hotels Ltd.* v. *Arab Republic of Egypt,* ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Decision on the Application for Annulment, February 5, 2002 *[\"Wena Hotels\"]* **(DL-3), \u00b6** 79.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 162.\n\n122.\n\nRelying on *TECO* v. *Guatemala151* and *Wena v. Egypt,152* the Respondent also contends that insufficient reasoning, as opposed to a complete failure to state reasons, does not warrant annulment, and that the obligation to state the reasons does not require that each reason be stated expressly, but may be implicit in the Tribunal\u2019s reasoning.153 Moreover, citing *Soufraki v. United Arab Emirates,154* the Respondent argues that some *ad hoc* committees have also suggested that they have discretion to further explain or clarify the tribunal\u2019s reasoning rather than annulling the award.155\n\n*TECO* **(AL-027), \u00b6** 249.\n\n*Wena Hotels* **(DL-3),** \u00b6 81.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 164 and 165.\n\n*Soufraki* **(DL-7), \u00b6** 24.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 166.\n\n123.\n\nThe Respondent further stresses that, under Article 48 of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal need not address and respond to each and every argument raised by the parties and that, in fact, even a failure to deal with every question under ICSID Convention Article 48 is not a ground for annulment under ICSID Convention Article 52(1)(e).156\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 220.\n\n124.\n\nWith regards to the annulment ground based on a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)), the Respondent argues that the award should only be annulled on this basis when *the tribunal* has departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, since it is for the tribunal to ensure that such fundamental principles are respected throughout the arbitration.157\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 158. In support of this argument the Respondent relies on *Occidental* **(AL-022), \u00b6** 60 and in *Vivendi I* **(AL-025), \u00b6** 83.\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent notes that *ad hoc* committees have only admitted this ground in \"extreme\" cases given that, as explained by the *Wena* v. *Egypt158 ad hoc* committee, the \"serious departure\" requirement means that the departure from the fundamental rule of procedure \"must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.\"159\n\n*Wena Hotels* **(DL-3), \u00b6** 58.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 159 and 160.\n\n126.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that when this annulment ground is based on an alleged violation of a party\u2019s right to be heard the \"bar is set high.\"160 In this regard, the Respondent cites the recent annulment decision in *Venezuela Holdings* according to which \"[i]n the limited number of cases in which *ad hoc* committees have given serious consideration to the contention that a party has been denied the right to be heard, it has been on the basis that a tribunal reached its ultimate award on a ground that one or both parties had had no opportunity to address at all in its argument.\"161\n\nSee Respondent\u2019s letter of April 24, 2017.\n\n*Venezuela Holdings* **(AL-066), \u00b6** 133.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal\u2019s Manifest Excess of Powers and the Award\u2019s Failure to State the Reasons upon which it is based**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Gambrinus\u2019 allegations regarding the Award\u2019s alleged failure to state the reasons and the Tribunal\u2019s manifest excess of powers constitute an attempt to completely re-litigate its case on jurisdiction and to introduce new jurisdictional arguments that had never been raised before the Tribunal, such as the lack of jurisdiction over the question of the existence of the 2008 Transfer.162\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 19 and 25.\n\n128.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Award unambiguously sets out the reasons which led the Tribunal to conclude that it lacked jurisdiction.163 Furthermore, the Tribunal decided well within the scope of its powers when it declined jurisdiction over Gambrinus\u2019 claims, applying the proper law to the issue of the ownership over the alleged investment.164\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 20 and 206 to 234.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 23 and 235 to 280. In response to the Applicant\u2019s argument, based on the annulment decision in *Venezuela Holdings* **(AL-066),** that a tribunal\u2019s failure to address relevant principles of the applicable law concerning existence and scope of property rights constitutes an annullable error (see \u00b6 76 above), the Respondent contends that, unlike in *Venezuela Holdings* **(AL-066),** in the present case the Tribunal carefully applied the relevant sources of law. In particular, the Respondent points out that the Tribunal examined the 2008 Transfer under Venezuelan law and concluded that it was ineffective because of the essential nature given to the \"cash or cash equivalent\" requirement. See Respondent\u2019s letter of April 24, 2017.\n\n129.\n\nBelow is a more detailed summary of the Respondent\u2019s position on each of the annullable errors identified by Gambrinus.\n\n***a. The Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the 2008 Transfer as being void*** **ab initio**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Applicant\u2019s argument that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by finding that the 2008 Transfer as being void *ab initio* must fail because it is based on a defence that Gambrinus never raised before the Tribunal.\n\n131.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Applicant\u2019s argument regarding relative versus absolute nullity suggests (i) that Venezuela had no standing to raise the inexistence of the 2008 Transfer in the arbitration proceeding and (ii) that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to declare the investment non-existent.165 Yet, at no point did Gambrinus make these submissions to the Tribunal.166 In fact, the Respondent notes that the Applicant requested the Tribunal to decide on the validity of the 2008 Transfer when it included this question in the joint list of questions submitted by the Parties to the Tribunal after the submission of the post-hearing reply briefs (the **\"Joint List of Questions\").167**\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 264.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 98. In response to the Applicant\u2019s allegations that it had properly raised this issue before the Tribunal, the Respondent contends that the \"vague\" references identified by Gambrinus (the footnote in the July 2014 Submission and the sentence in the 2014 Post-Hearing Reply) cannot, \"under any possible definition, qualify as an objection to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\" Additionally, the Respondent contends that the statements made in the Rodner Opinion on this issue cannot be considered as an integral part of Grambrinus\u2019 submissions, since it was not the role of the legal expert to present objections to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction that Gambrinus had failed to submit. See Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 100 to 104.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 266.\n\n132.\n\nFor the Respondent, the very fact that these defenses were not explicitly submitted by the Applicant in any of its submissions is the best evidence that the Tribunal did not \"manifestly\" exceed its powers by not subscribing them.168\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6268.\n\n133.\n\nIn response to the Applicant\u2019s argument that \"the evidence showed\" that under Venezuelan law, even if Gambrinus had failed to comply with Section 6.7(i) of the JIA, the 2008 Transfer had to be given effect, the Respondent contends that the legal evidence submitted by the Parties in this regard differed. The Respondent points out that, in contrast with the views of Mr. Rodner (which were not even endorsed in Gambrinus\u2019 submission), the evidence submitted by Venezuela, including the opinion of Dr. Garcia Montoya, \"showed that the parties had agreed on the consequences of such a failure in the JIA and the ByLaws and that, pursuant to these specific provisions, the [2008 Transfer] had no effect *ipso iure.\"169*\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 271. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 93 to 95.\n\n134.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, contrary to what is argued by the Applicant, the findings of the *ad hoc* committee in *Occidental v. Ecuador* in no way support Gambrinus\u2019 application for annulment. According to the Respondent, the issue at stake in such a case was whether the majority of the tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers when granting to Occidental a compensation based on 100% of the value of a participation contract in an oil field while 40% of this amount corresponded to the rights assigned to Andes (a Chinese company not protected by the investment treaty between Ecuador and the United States).170\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 273.\n\n135.\n\nFor the Respondent, Gambrinus\u2019 attempts to apply the findings of the *ad hoc* committee in *Occidental* v. *Ecuador* to this case must fail for several reasons.\n\n136.\n\nFirst, the Respondent notes that while Occidental was seeking to benefit from its own breach of Ecuadorian law by inflating the amount of compensation it was claiming against Ecuador, in the present case Venezuela showed that Gamrbinus had failed to make an investment under the BIT because of Gambrinus\u2019 failure to comply with an essential contractual requirement.171\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 276.\n\n137.\n\nThe Respondent also points out that an essential finding of the *Occidental ad hoc* committee was the contradictory reasoning of the tribunal, which had based its decision on the inexistence of the assignment of rights to Andes while at the same time recognizing Andes\u2019 rights in order to justify its conclusion. Instead, in the present case Gambrinus has failed to show any such contradiction.172\n\n*Id.*\n\n138.\n\nAdditionally, the Respondent argues that the governing law in this case is Venezuelan law and therefore Gambrinus cannot simply extrapolate some of the findings of the *Occidental* committee regarding Ecuadorian laws and Ecuadorian Supreme Court decisions and claim that the same principles apply to this case.173\n\n*Id.*\n\n139.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent notes that the *Occidental* v. *Ecuador* case concerned the consequences of a failure to obtain a relevant authorization under the Ecuadorian Hydrocarbon Law, and that under the Ecuadorian Civil Code such a failure would entail absolute nullity, which would need to be declared by a judge. The Respondent highlights that, in contrast with the present case, these provisions of Ecuadorian law were discussed at length before the *Occidental* tribunal. Furthermore, they are of no relevance for the case at hand \"where an essential contractual requirement was at stake, in relation to which the JIA and Fertinitro\u2019s By-Laws expressly provided that non-compliant transfers would automatically be null, void and without effect [...], manifestly excluding any need for a prior declaration by the judge.\"174\n\n*Id.* See also Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 108. Similarly, the Respondent also contends that Gambrinus\u2019 arguments regarding Prof. Iribarren expert opinion in *Crystailex* **(AL-018)** must fail, because such case concerned the validity of the decision of a public organ in Venezuela \"which is inapposite to issues of Venezuelan private contract law, pursuant to which the parties are free to agree that a failure to comply with certain essential requirements would automatically result in share transfers being 'null, void and of no force or effect.'\" See Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 278. See also Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 109.\n\n***b. The Tribunal\u2019s application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate transfers***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal applied the proper law to the interpretation of Section 6.7(i) of the JIA and arrived to the conclusion that this provision applied to interaffiliate transfers.\n\n141.\n\nThe Tribunal assessed the weight to be given to the intention of the parties to the JIA, applying the relevant rule of contract interpretation set forth in Article 12 of the Venezuelan Code of Civil Procedure, which had been relied upon by both Parties\u2019 legal experts. On this basis, the Tribunal reached the conclusion that: (i) the intention of the parties would only take precedence over the contract language in case the contractual provisions were obscure, ambiguous or deficient; and (ii) \"because Article 6.7(i) of the JIA clearly applied on its face to all transfers - and as such contained no 'obscurity, ambiguity or deficiency' - the Tribunal was not entitled under Venezuelan law to simply disregard it in the light of any alleged 'purpose' or 'real intention' of the parties.\"175\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 244.\n\n142.\n\nThus, for the Respondent, the Tribunal relied on the relevant Venezuelan law on the record and applied it to the facts of the case.176 As explained by the *ad hoc* committee in *CDC v. Seychelles,177* the fact that the Tribunal did not rely on the arguments put forward by Gambrinus\u2019 legal expert, does not mean that it failed to apply the proper law.178\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 245.\n\n*CDC Group* **(AL-0009), \u00b6** 45.\n\nThe Respondent notes that its legal expert, Dr. Garcia Montoya, demonstrated that, in the absence of obscurity, ambiguity or deficiency, the text of the contract prevailed as an expression of the intention of the parties under Venezuelan law and, according to the Respondent, the Tribunal upheld the argument of Dr. Garcia Montoya on this point. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 51 and 52.\n\n143.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent contends that the Award clearly states the reasons which led the Tribunal to this conclusion and such \"reasons are consistent, they are not frivolous and they enable the reader to understand how the Tribunal reached its conclusion in this respect.\"179\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 214.\n\n144.\n\nContrary to Gambrinus\u2019 reading of the Award, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal did not agree with Gambrinus that the application of Section 6.7(i) of the JIA to all permitted dispositions would render these dispositions literally impossible, nor did it \"explicitly find,\" as alleged by the Applicant, that cash equivalency served no purpose for interaffiliate or other permitted dispositions under the JIA.180 If anything, the Tribunal simply took note of the arguments put forward by Gambrinus and found that, pursuant to the relevant principles of interpretation under Venezuelan law, a determination on these points was immaterial and, therefore, unnecessary.181\n\nThe Respondent also argues that Gambrinus\u2019 allegation that the Tribunal identified a contractual ambiguity both within the Fertinitro By-Laws and between the Fertinitro By-Laws and the JIA is wrong. On the contrary, after carefully analyzing the text of the different relevant provisions in the By-Laws, the Tribunal expressly found that there was no ambiguity. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 47 to 50.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 213. See also Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 53 to 55.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion on whether the 2008 Transfer involved cash/cash-consideration***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Tribunal applied the proper law when assessing whether the 2008 Transfer had been made in accordance with the cash equivalency requirement set forth in Section 6.7(i) of the JIA. In doing this assessment, the Tribunal agreed with the Respondent\u2019s submission and legal expert\u2019s opinion that, under Venezuelan law, the Gambrinus\u2019 shares are not \"cash equivalent\" since they are not readily convertible into cash on a short-term basis.182 Contrary to Gambrinus\u2019 suggestion, when reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal did not even refer to (let alone exclusively rely on) the standard provided by IAS 7.183\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 247 and 248.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 250. In response to the Applicant\u2019s argument regarding the Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to address Mr. Rodner\u2019s opinion as to whether a set-off of monetary obligations had to be regarded as satisfying the cash equivalency requirement, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal was under no duty to address this, given that the issue was irrelevant in light of the Tribunal\u2019s finding that the Common Share Subscription Agreement was a share-for-share transaction. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 57 to 62. Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the Applicant\u2019s arguments in this regard are misleading since the mere fact that an obligation is denominated in money is completely irrelevant when assessing whether such obligation has been paid in cash or cash equivalency, as required by the JIA. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 84 to 87.\n\n146.\n\nIn this regard, the Respondent argues that there can be no doubt that the Tribunal sought to apply Venezuelan law and that Gambrinus should not use this annulment proceeding to challenge whether the Tribunal was right in its conclusion, since this would go to the substance of the Tribunal\u2019s decision and as such, as explained in *Continental Casualty* v. *Argentina,184* cannot amount to a manifest excess of power.185\n\n*Continental Casualty* **(DL-19), \u00b6** 91.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 249.\n\n***d. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription Agreement***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nIn response to Gambrinus\u2019 argument regarding the alleged inconsistency in the Tribunal \"non-textual\" approach when qualifying the Common Share Subscription Agreement as a \"share-for-share\" transaction, the Respondent argues that the Applicant has failed to show how this allegation could be relevant for the purpose of the annulment.\n\n148.\n\nFor the Respondent, the fact that the Applicant is not convinced by the reasons put forward by the Tribunal is irrelevant since, as explained in *El Paso v. Argentina,186* unconvincing reasons do not amount to lack of reasons and thus it is not within the power of an *ad hoc* committee to decide whether it agrees or disagrees with the reasons expressed by the tribunal.187\n\nEl Paso **(DL-8),\u00b6** 217.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 218 and 2019.\n\n***e. The Tribunal\u2019s failure to address and apply the 5-year prescription period***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nCiting *Wena* v. *Egypt,188* the Respondent argues that a tribunal cannot reasonably be expected to respond in its reasoning to a defense which was never articulated by any of the parties.189 In this regard, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal did not fail to address and apply the 5-year prescription simply because the Applicant never submitted that Venezuela\u2019s jurisdictional objection based on the 2008 Transfer was time-barred.190\n\n*Wena Hotels* **(DL-3), \u00b6** 82.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 231.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 226. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 63.\n\n150.\n\nFor the Respondent, the only reference to the prescription period in Gambrinus\u2019 submissions appears in a footnote of its July 2014 Submission, in which it both misread and criticized Venezuela\u2019s legal expert argument in this regard. The Respondent notes that the Applicant did not put forward in that submission - or in any of its subsequent briefs -any defense that the Respondent\u2019s objection should be declared time-barred and dismissed. Similarly, the Respondent adds that nowhere did Gambrinus\u2019 legal expert, Mr. Rodner, opine on the issue.191\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 228 and 229. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 64.\n\n151.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent points out that the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit a list of the questions that they deemed should be addressed in the Award and that Gambrinus did not include the prescription period issue in this list.192\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 221 and 222. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 65.\n\n***f. The Tribunal\u2019s failure to apply and address relevant international law***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nWith regards to the Applicant\u2019s argument that the Tribunal failed to address relevant principles of international law, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal had no reason to address the awards cited by Gambrinus, since such awards dealt with the scope of the provision contained or implied in some investment treaties that investment must be made in accordance with the host State law and were thus irrelevant and immaterial to the Tribunal\u2019s decision.193\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 232 to 234. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 68 to 72.\n\n**(3) The Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n153.\n\nContrary to the Applicant\u2019s arguments on the Respondent\u2019s \"ambush tactics,\" the Respondent contends that its JIA Defense was a legitimate complement to its jurisdictional objection based on the lack of Gambrinus\u2019 investment, which was prompted by Gambrinus\u2019 late submission of the details of the 2008 Transfer.194\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 172 to 182.\n\n154.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that, contrary to the Applicant\u2019s suggestion, under the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1 the Tribunal had the discretion to authorize (or not) a supplement to the Parties\u2019 written submissions and it was in the light of this power that the Tribunal admitted the Respondent\u2019s JIA Defense.195\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 5 and 22.\n\n155.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the procedures put in place by the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 2 were in no way imposed upon the Applicant. On the contrary, the Respondent argues that the Applicant \"specifically suggested, negotiated and agreed on the very procedural arrangements that it now claims 'failed to erase the imbalance that arose at the hearing.'\"196 In this regard, according to the Respondent, the fact that Gambrinus objected to the introduction of the JIA Defense is irrelevant. What matters is that Gambrinus never raised any objection in relation to the subsequent post-hearing procedure agreed to ensure Gambrinus\u2019 right to be heard.197\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 185. Among other things, the Respondent highlights that, contrary to the Applicant\u2019s suggestion that it was precluded from submitting evidence after the Arbitration Hearing, Gambrinus expressly agreed that no further factual evidence would be submitted in the post-hearing brief. Counter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 189.\n\nRejoinder on Annulment, \u00b623. In this sense, the Respondent highlights that it was Gambrinus\u2019 counsel who, when they objected to the introduction of the JIA Defense by the Respondent at the Arbitration Hearing, requested that they be able to address this issue in written submissions. The Respondent notes that \"[t]he bulk of these procedural arrangements - and not only their 'timetable' - were then negotiated between the Parties\u2019 respective counsel, who reached an agreement on all aspects of the procedure to be implemented - including the number, content, order, calendar and length of submissions and the extent of any evidence to be enclosed.\" According to the Respondent, in fact, the principle that this issue would be addressed in specific submissions before post-hearing briefs was agreed before the exact \"timetable\" for such submissions was set. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6\u00b6 24 to 26.\n\n156.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent notes that the post-hearing phase agreed by the Parties lasted more than six months and that throughout this time Gambrinus never took issue with the agreed procedure, nor did it request that this procedure be amended or that further arrangements be put in place.198\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 192.\n\n157.\n\nOn this basis, the Respondent contends that, pursuant to Arbitration Rule 27, the Applicant is precluded form alleging that the established procedure constituted a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.199\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 194. In support of this argument the Respondent cites the annulment decision in *Klockner Industrie-Ardagen GmbH and others* v. *United Republic of Cameroon,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/2, Decision on Annulment, May 13, 1985 *[\"Klockner I']* **(DL-13), \u00b6** 88; *Fraport Annulment* **(AL-008), \u00b6** 206; and *RSM* **(DL-4), \u00b6** 27.\n\n158.\n\nIn any event, the Respondent argues that the procedure was fair to both Parties, guaranteeing the right to be heard and the equality between both Parties.200 In this regard, the Respondent notes that the Parties were given the opportunity to submit specific written submissions and a legal opinion dealing exclusively with the JIA Defense and that Gambrinus had yet another opportunity to supplement this submission or to rebut the points made by Venezuela in two rounds of post-hearing briefs and reply briefs.201\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 198.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 199. According to the Respondent, the Applicant\u2019s reliance on Pey *Casado* **(AL-016),** *TECO* **(AL-027)** and *Fraport Annulment* **(AL-008)** is misplaced. For the Respondent, such cases only serve to confirm that, because Gambrinus was clearly given the opportunity to present its position on the JIA Defense, the *\"principe du contradictoire\"* was fully complied with in the present case. Rejoinder on Annulment, \u00b6 30.\n\n159.\n\nAdditionally, and contrary to the Applicant\u2019s suggestion that its inability to address the JIA Defense during the Arbitration Hearing constitutes a violation of its fundamental right to present its case, the Respondent contends that Arbitration Rule 29 expressly contemplates the possibility for the Parties to agree that all or some issues be addressed on a document-only basis, with no hearing.202\n\nCounter-Memorial on Annulment, \u00b6 202.\n\n**V. ANALYSIS**\n---------------\n\n160.\n\nArticle 52(1) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\n*(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*a. that the Tribunal was not properly constituted;*\n\n*b. that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers;*\n\n*c. that there was corruption on the part of a member of the Tribunal;*\n\n*d. that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure; or*\n\n*e. that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n**A. Article 52(1)(b) - Manifest Excess of Powers**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Relevant Standard of Review**\n-----------------------------------\n\n161.\n\nThe Applicant seeks annulment pursuant to Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The underlying arguments on which the Applicant relies upon to seek annulment on this ground are to some extent common to the ones used to seek annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. It should be noted that the standard to set aside an award under the two provisions is neither similar nor identical. The Committee will, despite the reliance by the Applicant on similar underlying arguments, deal with the application for annulment under the two provisions separately.\n\n162.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in the *Klockner I* annulment decision stated as follows:\n\n*[A]n arbitral tribunal\u2019s lack of jurisdiction, whether said to be partial or total, necessarily comes within the scope of an \"excess of powers \" under Article 52(1)(b)203*\n\n*Klockner I* **(DL-13), \u00b6** 4. This wording was later cited in *CMS Gas Transmission Co.* v. *Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8, Decision on Annulment, September 25, 2007 [\"CMS\"], \u00b6 47.\n\n163.\n\nThe ground of manifest excess of power is not merely limited to lack of jurisdiction. This ground of annulment is also applicable when the tribunal disregards the applicable law or grounds its decision in the award on a law other than the law applicable under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention.204\n\n*Klockner I* **(DL-13), \u00b6\u00b6** 58-59; *MINE* **(AL-006), \u00b6** 5.03; *CMS,* \u00b6 49; *Empresas Lucchetti, S.A. and Lucchetti Per\u00fa, S.A., sub nom. Industria Nacional de Alimentos, S.A. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, S.A. v. Republic of Peru,* ICSID Case No. ARB/03/4, Annulment Decision, September 5, 2007 [\"*Lucchetti*\"]; ; *MTD Equity Sdn. Bhd. and MTD Chile S.A.* v. *Republic of Chile,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/7, Annulment Decision, March 21, 2007 [\"MTD\"], \u00b6 44; *Soufraki* **(DL-** 7),\u00b645.\n\n164.\n\nThe *ad hoc* committee in the *CMS* annulment decision stated as follows:\n\n*A complete failure to apply the law which a tribunal is directed by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention can also constitute a manifest excess of powers.205*\n\n*CMS,* \u00b6 49.\n\n165.\n\nThere is a distinction between non-application of the applicable law and an incorrect application of the applicable law. The former is a ground for annulment while the latter is not.206\n\nSome annulment committees have stated that an egregious error in the application of the law could also be a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n166.\n\nIn the annulment decision in *MINE,* the committee stated as follows:\n\n*Disregard of the applicable rules of law must be distinguished from erroneous application of those rules which, even if manifestly unwarranted, furnishes no ground for annulment.207*\n\n*MINE* **(AL-006), \u00b6** 5.04.\n\n167.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that in order for the Award to be annulled under this ground, there are two requirements. First, the Tribunal must have exceeded its powers by \"deciding questions\" not submitted to it or refusing to decide questions properly before it, or by failing to apply the proper law.208 Second, the excess must be manifest. The excess of power must be \"obvious, evident, clear, self-evident and extremely serious.\"209\n\n*CDC Group* **(AL-0009).**\n\nEl Paso **(DL-8), \u00b6** 142.\n\n**(2) The Annullable Errors Identified by the Applicant under the Ground of Manifest Excess of Powers**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n168.\n\nAs explained above, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal committed annullable errors that constitute a manifest excess of powers under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention in six (6) different ways: (i) in its treatment of the 2008 Transfer as being void *ab initio-,* (ii) in its application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate transfers; (iii) in its conclusion on whether the 2008 Transfer involved cash/cash-consideration; (iv) in its conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription Agreement; (v) in its failure to address and apply the 5-year prescription period; and (vi) in its failure to apply and address relevant international law. The Committee will now analyze each one of them.\n\n***a. The Tribunal\u2019s treatment of the 2008 Transfer as being void*** **ab initio**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n169.\n\nThe contention of the Applicant is that the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that the 2008 Transfer was void due to Gambrinus\u2019 failure to abide by the cash equivalency requirement of Section 6.7(1) of the JIA represents a manifest excess of jurisdiction. The contention of Gambrinus is that, even if the transfer was a technical non-compliance of Article VI of the JIA and Chapter III of the Fertinitro By-Laws, *quod non,* it would merely be a technical breach and therefore the 2008 Transfer should not have been treated by the Tribunal as being null and void.\n\n170.\n\nThe Applicant relies heavily on the annulment decision in *Occidental v Ecuador210* to further argue that the 2008 Transfer was valid and effective until declared otherwise by the competent court under the JIA (i.e. arbitral tribunal under the rules of the International Chamber of Commerce) and not by the Tribunal. Gambrinus also relies on the expert opinion provided by the Respondent\u2019s legal expert, Prof. Iribarren, in *Crystallex International Corp* v *Venezuela211* and on the opinion of its own expert, Mr. Rodner.\n\n*Occidental* **(AL-022).**\n\n*Crystallex* **(AL-018).**\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent, on the other hand, contends that Gambrinus is in effect putting forward an entirely new defence.\n\n172.\n\nThe Committee notes that the question of whether failure to comply by the cash equivalency requirement would render the contract voidable as opposed to it being void *ab initio* was not in the Joint List of Questions submitted to the Tribunal. Hence, the Tribunal cannot be reproached for not having addressed the issue that it was not asked to consider.212\n\n*Wena Hotels* **(DL-3)** \u00b682\n\n173.\n\nThe Tribunal in the Award considered Article VI of the JIA and in particular Section 6.7(i) and held that the transfer of the Fertinitro shares was null and void and of no effect. The Tribunal was not asked to consider whether the transfer was voidable and hence the Tribunal cannot be faulted for its decision.\n\n174.\n\nThe Committee is also of the view that the Tribunal did not have to decide whether the 2008 Transfer can be said to be a nullity before a competent court made such a determination in view of the fact that the issue was not raised nor argued comprehensively before the Tribunal.\n\n175.\n\nWhen arguments were addressed during the Hearing on Annulment with regard to the *Occidental* annulment decision, the Committee asked the Applicant whether Venezuelan law and Ecuadorian law on this issue are sufficiently similar for the decision in *Occidental* to be applicable to the present proceedings.213 The Committee was not able to obtain a satisfactory answer from the Applicant. The Respondent submitted that the Venezuelan Civil Code does not include an equivalent provision to Article 1698 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code.\n\n*Occidental* **(AL-022).**\n\n176.\n\nIt should be noted that in the *Occidental* case, the issue of whether a competent court should declare whether the transfer of shares was null or void *ab initio* was raised before the tribunal, whereas in the present case this issue is being raised for the very first time before the Committee. In this regard, it should also be noted that this was an issue that was not included among the Joint List of Questions214 that the parties submitted to the Tribunal.\n\nJoint List of Questions **(A-59).**\n\n177.\n\nIn light of the above, the decision in *Occidental* whilst being persuasive, is distinguishable on the facts and in law and is not applicable to the present dispute.\n\n178.\n\nThe Committee is therefore of the view that the Tribunal did not manifestly exceed its powers.\n\n***b. The Tribunal\u2019s application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate transfers***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Applicant\u2019s principal argument is that, when determining whether the cash equivalency requirement applied to inter-affiliate transfers, the Tribunal manifestly failed to ascertain and apply the real intent of the parties under the JIA and the Fertinitro ByLaws, as required under Venezuelan law and thus, failed to apply the proper law.\n\n180.\n\nThe Committee is satisfied that the Tribunal applied Venezuelan law. In particular, the Tribunal considered Article 12 of the Venezuelan Code of Civil Procedure in order to interpret the JIA and the Fertinitro By-Laws. Article 12 reads as follows:\n\n*En la interpretaci\u00f3n de contratos o actos que presenten oscuridad, ambig\u00fcedad o deficiencia, los jueces se atendr\u00e1n al prop\u00f3sito y ala intenci\u00f3n de las partes o de los otorgantes, teniendo en mira las exigencias de la Ley, de la verdad y de la buena fe.*\n\n181.\n\nThe English translation reads as follows:\n\n*When interpreting contracts that are obscure, ambiguous or, defective the judge shall look to the purpose and intention of the parties or the issuer, taking into account the requirements of the law, truth and good faith,* [emphasis added]\n\n182.\n\nIn applying this Article, the Tribunal analysed the provisions of the JIA regulating the transfer of shares, including the cash equivalency requirement under Section 6(7)(i), and came to the conclusion that there was no obscurity ambiguity or deficiency in such provisions and that, therefore, it was not allowed to look beyond the plain contract language which required all transfers to be made for cash or cash equivalent.215\n\nAward, \u00b6\u00b6 265 and 266.\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal also carefully analysed the Applicant\u2019s argument that Article 12 of the Fertinitro By-Laws does not subject inter-affiliate transfers to a cash equivalency requirement. It was further argued that Article 14 of the Fertinitro By-Laws is subordinate to Article 12 and that, in light of the conflict with Section 6 of the JIA, the Tribunal should have analysed or ascertained the real intention of the parties.\n\n184.\n\nThe Tribunal expressly dealt with these issues in its Award.216 It first stated that there is no prevalence of the Fertinitro By-Laws over the text of the JIA.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 261.\n\n185.\n\nIt then considered Articles 12 and 14 of the Fertinitro By-Laws and came to the conclusion that there was no conflict between the Fertinitro By-Laws and the JIA by holding as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal notes that differently from Section 6.2 of the JIA which makes any Disposition of shares, not excluding transfers to Affiliates, subject to the condition of a \"cash or cash equivalents \" consideration under Section 6.7(i), no similar condition is apparently prescribed by the Fertinitro By-Laws regarding transfers to Affiliates. Under Article 12 of the By-Laws (entitled \"Exception to the Restriction on Disposal and Encumbrance of Company Shares \"), the shareholders may transfer or confer rights on their shares without being obligated to comply with the provisions of Chapter III (inclusive of Articles 11 to 15), \"except where provided for under paragraph three of clause thirteen, \" in case (under B) of disposal of shares to Affiliates. Paragraph three of Article 13, dealing with \"Transfers to Third Parties, \" is no exception to the unconditioned disposal of shares to Affiliates under Article 12, considering that transfers to Affiliates are not transfers to Third Parties.217*\n\n*However, the conflict is removed by the starting language of Article 14, making its provisions applicable \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision contained in these Articles of Incorporation/ By-Laws, \" the reference to any other provision including Article 12.218*\n\n*The prevalence of Article 14 over the exemption of transfer to Affiliates under Article 12 is confirmed by the last part of same Article 14, providing (under B) that \"[a]ny disposal or transfer of Company shares must be carried out pursuant to the provisions contained in the Agreement, \" where \"Agreement \" cannot but refer to the JIA. Also under the By-Laws, therefore, transfers of shares to Affdiates are subject for their validity to the condition of payment being made in cash or cash equivalents, as provided by Section 6.7(i) of the JIA.219*\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 262.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 263.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 264.\n\n186.\n\nThe Committee considers that the proper law that had to be applied is Venezuelan law and that the Tribunal was mandated to interpret the provisions of the JIA and the Fertinitro ByLaws to ensure that the transfer of the Fertinitro shares to the Applicant complied with Venezuelan law.\n\n187.\n\nThe Tribunal did just that. It interpreted the provisions of the JIA and the Fertinitro ByLaws in accordance with Venezuelan law and expressly dealt with the relationship between the JIA and the Fertinitro By-Laws, as explained above.\n\n188.\n\nAccordingly, in the Committee view, the Tribunal cannot be faulted in its application of Venezuelan law and its interpretation of the latter does not give rise to a manifest excess of power.\n\n***c. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion on whether or not the 2008 Transfer involved cash/cash consideration***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the Tribunal\u2019s reliance on IAS 7 for defining cash or cash equivalency is flawed220 and constitutes a manifest excess of power, as it represented the failure to apply proper principles of Venezuelan law. The Applicant further contends that IAS 7 has no status under Venezuelan law. It also contends that IAS 7 was introduced in breach of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 247, 248, 249 and 250.\n\n190.\n\nAccording to the Applicant, Venezuelan law recognizes set-off as a proper manner of discharging money obligations. The Applicant further contends that the Tribunal failed to discuss and apply the principles of set-off, while these principles are part of Venezuelan law, in particular Article 1333 of the Venezuelan Civil Code.\n\n191.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal did allude to the issue of set-off.221 It also referred to Mr. Rodner\u2019s opinion as to whether the set-off of money obligations would satisfy the requirements of Section 6.7 of the JIA and came to the conclusion that the transfer of shares did not comply with such requirement. Accordingly, there is no merit in the Applicant\u2019s argument that the Tribunal did not address the issue of the set-off and thereby committed an annullable error.\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6\u00b6 230, 258, 260\n\n192.\n\nFurthermore, contrary to what is argued by the Applicant, the Tribunal did not rely upon IAS 7 for its conclusion.\n\n193.\n\nTherefore, the Committee is of the view that the Tribunal considered in the Award whether the 2008 Transfer complied with the cash equivalency requirement under Venezuelan law and its interpretation does not give rise to a manifest excess of powers.\n\n***d. The Tribunal\u2019s conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription Agreement***\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nAs explained above, Gambrinus argues that, while the Tribunal applied a strict literalist approach to the JIA, it applied a non-textual approach when it construed the Common Share Subscription Agreement \"as 'converting' the terms of the January 2008 Share Purchase Agreement into an agreement to engage in a share-for-share transaction.\"222 According to the Applicant, the Award\u2019s failure to reconcile this different approaches leads to an unexplained inconsistency in its treatment of the cash equivalency requirement which represents a manifest excess of powers of the Tribunal under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention (as well as a failure to state the reasons under Article 52(1)(e)).\n\nMemorial on Annulment, \u00b6 200 and 201.\n\n195.\n\nThe Respondent takes the view that there is no error in the manner in which the Tribunal construed the Common Share Subscription Agreement. It further takes the view that it is not within the purview of an *ad hoc* committee to decide whether it agrees or disagrees with the reasons expressed by the Tribunal.\n\n196.\n\nHaving considered both the arguments of Gambrinus and Venezuela on this issue, the Committee is of the view that there is no merit in Gambrinus\u2019 argument. The Tribunal has given reasons as to the manner in which it construes the JIA, the Fertinitro By-Laws and the Common Share Subscription Agreement.\n\n197.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, these reasons are not frivolous. It is not within the powers of the Committee to decide whether it agrees or disagrees with the conclusion of the Tribunal. The Committee may only assess whether, in reaching its conclusion, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers.\n\n***e. The Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to address and apply the 5-year prescription period***\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n198.\n\nThe argument of the Applicant is that, pursuant to the Venezuelan Civil Code Article 1346 and the Fertinitro By-Laws, a 5-year prescription period was applicable for nullity actions. The Applicant contends that the Tribunal did not address the issue of the prescription period.\n\n199.\n\nThis was another issue that was not raised by the Applicant in the Joint List of Questions that the Tribunal was requested to consider. The only reference to the issue of limitation or prescription period is in footnote 57 of the July 2014 Submission. The Committee is therefore of the view that the Tribunal cannot be faulted in not addressing the issue of prescription period or limitation when it was not raised specifically as an issue or argued *in extensor* by the Applicant before the Tribunal.\n\n***f. The Tribunal\u2019s alleged failure to apply and address relevant international law***\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nThe argument of the Applicant is that the Tribunal did not address or take into account the principle of public international law that purported minor technical non-compliance with contractual or regulatory provisions - such as the cash equivalency requirement set out in Section 6.7 of the JIA -, cannot deprive an investor of its treaty rights under international law, \"particularly where the alleged technical error arose from a good faith misunderstanding.\"223 The Applicant relied on 4 authorities in its submissions.224\n\nReply on Annulment, \u00b6 81.\n\n*Fraport AG Frankfurt Airport Sen's. Worldwide v. Republic of Phillipines,* ICSID Case No. ARB/3/25, Award, August 16, 2007 [\"Fraport\"] **(DL-022), \u00b6** 396; *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomunikasyon Hizmetleri A.S.* v. *Republic of Kazakhstan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/16, Award, July 26, 2016 *[\"Rumeli\"]* **(AL-0030), \u00b6** 319; *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s* **(AL-029), \u00b6** 86; *Desert Line Projects* **(AL-033), \u00b6 104;** *Metalpar* **(AL-032), \u00b6 84.**\n\n201.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that the contractual provisions of an underlying agreement may not be minor technical defects which can be disregarded.\n\n202.\n\nFurther, the Committee has also considered very carefully the 4 authorities cited by the Applicant and they relate to whether the claimants had a protected investment under the different applicable bilateral investment treaties given the alleged failure of the investors to comply with the laws of the host State when making their investments. However, the issue in this annulment proceeding is not whether Gambrinus failed to comply with local legislation thereby losing the procedural protections granted by the BIT. Thus, the Committee agrees with the Respondent that the authorities are neither relevant nor applicable. In the present case, there was no investment within the meaning of the JIA, read with the BIT and the laws of Venezuela.\n\n203.\n\nThe Committee is therefore of the view that the Tribunal did not make a manifest error in not dealing with the international law argument specified in paragraph 200 above, as it was not applicable.\n\n**B. Article 52(1)(e) - Failure to State the Reasons**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Relevant Standard of Review**\n-----------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nArticle 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\n*(1) Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*(e) that the award has failed to state the reasons on which it is based.*\n\n205.\n\nThis Article is connected to Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention according to which:\n\n*(3) The award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and shall state the reasons upon which it is based.*\n\n206.\n\nThe annulment committee in *MINE* v. *Guinea225* held that to annul an award under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the committee has to ascertain how the tribunal proceeded from Point A to Point B in arriving at its decision and stated the test in the following words:\n\n*In the Committee\u2019s view, the requirement to state the reasons is satisfied* as *long as the award enables one to follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B. and eventually to its conclusion, even if it made an error of fact or law.*\n\n*MINE* **(AL-006), \u00b6** 5.09\n\n207.\n\nIn *Wena Hotels* v. *Egypt* the annulment committee was of the view that when construing Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention, the committee is not empowered to reconsider \"whether the reasons underlying the Tribunal\u2019s decisions were appropriate or not, convincing or not.\"226\n\n*Wena Hotels* **(DL-3), \u00b6** 79\n\n208.\n\nFurthermore, as stated by the *TECO* v. *Guatemala* and other annulment committees,227 the Tribunal\u2019s failure to address \"every argument, piece of evidence or authority in the record\" is not a ground for annulment.228\n\n*Rumeli Annulment* **(DL-0017), \u00b6** 84.\n\n*TECO* **(AL-027), \u00b6** 249.\n\n209.\n\nThe Committee has considered the pronouncements of the *ad hoc* committees that are referred to in the preceding paragraphs and will apply the principles enunciated in those cases in its analysis.\n\n**(2) The Annullable Errors Identified by the Applicant under the Ground of Failure to State the Reasons**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n210.\n\nThe Committee sought to determine how the Tribunal arrived at its decision that jurisdiction did not exist under the ICSID Convention in respect of Gambrinus\u2019 claim. The Tribunal had to determine whether the Applicant is a protected foreign investor within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention read with Article 1(a) of the BIT. In the Committee\u2019s view, after having considered all the arguments of the Applicant and the Respondent, the Tribunal correctly expressed the reasons on which its conclusion is based, in the following terms:\n\n*Claimant owned no investment at the time of the alleged expropriation of Fertinitro shares on 10 October 2010, due to the Share Purchase Agreement with Inv. Polar being of no force and effect. Having made no investment which may fall within the BIT protection, Claimant\u2019s claim is not subject to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction which, accordingly, must be declined.229*\n\nAward, \u00b6 276.\n\n211.\n\nAs explained above, the Applicant has identified five (5) annullable errors under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention. In particular, the Applicant argues that the Tribunal failed to state the reasons upon which the Award is based: (i) in its application of the cash equivalency clause to inter-affiliate transfers; (ii) in its conclusion on whether the 2008 Transfer involved cash/cash-consideration; (iii) in its conclusion regarding the Common Share Subscription Agreement; (iv) in its failure to address and apply the 5-year prescription period and (v) in its failure to apply and address relevant international law. The Committee will now consider these five (5) arguments.\n\n212.\n\nThe Committee has dealt with the arguments (iii) to (v) when considering the Applicant\u2019s arguments under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention. It will adopt the reasons and conclusions set out therein. As to the arguments under (i) and (ii) above, the Committee is of the view that these two arguments raised by the Applicant are inter-related and can be dealt with together.\n\n213.\n\nThis necessitates a determination of whether it is possible to follow the Tribunal\u2019s construction of the sections of the JIA and the By-Laws which regulate the transfer of the Fertinitro shares and the reasons for the Tribunal\u2019s conclusion.\n\n214.\n\nIn the Award,230 the Tribunal construed the provisions of Article VI of the JIA, in particular Sections 6.1 and 6.2 which deal with restrictions on transfer and permitted dispositions. The Tribunal also considered Section 6.7(i) in particular, which provides \"that any disposition shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalent to the exclusion of any other consideration.\"\n\n*Id.,* \u00b6 247.\n\n215.\n\nThe Tribunal considered the Fertinitro By-Laws and also the argument of the Applicant that the Fertinitro By-Laws are inconsistent with the JIA and concluded that there was no conflict between the provisions of the two instruments regarding the transfer of shares.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal considered Article 12 of the Venezuelan Code of Civil Procedure, which was relied on by both experts, and noted that the Parties and their legal experts had discussed the rules of interpretation of Venezuelan law and that they reached different conclusions. The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the intention of the parties to the JIA had to be considered only if there was any ambiguity, as a supplementary means of interpretation.\n\n217.\n\nThe Tribunal further concluded that there was no obscurity, ambiguity or deficiency in the interpretation of Section 6.7(i) and that, therefore, the alleged intention of the parties should not take precedence over the contract language.\n\n218.\n\nIn considering these provisions of the JIA, the Tribunal did not accept the Applicant\u2019s argument that despite the clear wording of Section 6.7(i), such Section was not applicable to transfers to affiliates. The Tribunal also did not accept Gambrinus\u2019 additional argument that the Fertinitro By-Laws were inconsistent with the JIA. In fact, the Tribunal took the view that when the Sections of the JIA and the Fertinitro By-Laws were considered, they had the same effect.\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal then went on to deal with the Respondent\u2019s argument that the share-for-share transaction which Gambrinus relied upon as being in compliance with the JIA, was untenable because the shares in Gambrinus are not of cash equivalent. The Tribunal agreed with the Respondent that the shares in the Applicant are not a cash equivalent due to the reason that they are not immediately realisable liquid assets since they are not traded publicly.\n\n220.\n\nThe Tribunal subsequently considered the consequences of a breach of the JIA in particular Section 6.1 which provided that no owner of the shares shall sell its shares save in compliance with the provisions of Article VI and non-compliance with Article VI shall cause the transfer to be null, void and of no force or effect. The Tribunal therefore concluded that the 2008 Transfer could not be given effect to because the essential provisions of the JIA had not been complied with as there was no cash or cash equivalent provided for in respect of the sale of shares in the Common Share Subscription Agreement.231\n\n*Id*., \u00b6\u00b6 272, 273, 265, 267.\n\n221.\n\nGambrinus did not explicitly plead that the evidence showed that, even if Gambrinus had failed to comply with Section 6.7 of the JIA, the transfer had to be given effect. Before the Tribunal there was the expert opinions of Mr. Rodner and Dr. Garcia Montoya and it was up to the Tribunal to decide which of the two experts it found more persuasive and the fact that it preferred the evidence of one expert is not an annullable error.\n\n222.\n\nIn the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal stated the reasons on which the conclusion is based and therefore cannot be faulted. In the circumstances, there is no annullable error as such.\n\n223.\n\nGambrinus further argued that, in order to declare the 2008 Transfer null and void, there has to be a declaration by a competent tribunal under the JIA, namely an arbitral tribunal established pursuant to the Arbitration Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce. However, the Committee agrees with Venezuela that such argument was not in the Joint List of Questions that was submitted to the Tribunal nor was it explicitly pleaded before the Tribunal. Hence, the Tribunal was not in error in not dealing with this issue.\n\n224.\n\nIn conclusion, the Committee is of the view that in reading the Award one is able to proceed from Point A to Point B and does not find that the reasons given by the Tribunal for holding that it has no jurisdiction are frivolous or contradictory. In the Committee\u2019s view, the Tribunal has painstakingly construed the provisions of the JIA, the Fertinitro By-Laws and Venezuelan law, in coming to the conclusion that the provisions of the JIA and the ByLaws were not complied with by Gambrinus in respect of the transfer of shares.\n\n225.\n\nThe Committee therefore finds no merit in respect of the request by Gambrinus to annul the Award pursuant to Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**C. Article 52(1)(d) - Serious Departure from a Fundamental Rule of Procedure**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Relevant Standard of Review**\n-----------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nArticle 52(1)(d) reads as follows:\n\n*Either party may request annulment of the award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on one or more of the following grounds:*\n\n*(d) that there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure...*\n\n227.\n\nThe critical words in Article 52(1)(d) are \"serious\" and \"fundamental.\" There has been an adoption of a dual analysis by *ad hoc* committees that the departure from a rule of procedure must be \"serious\" and the rule of procedure must be \"fundamental.\"232\n\n*MINE* **(AL-006), \u00b6** 4.06; *Wena Hotels* **(DL-3), \u00b6** 56; *CDC Group* **(AL-0009), \u00b6** 48; *Occidental* **(AL-022), \u00b6** 62; *Tulip Real Estate and Development Netherlands B. V.* v. *Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/11/28, Decision on Annulment, December 30, 2015 [\"*Tulip*\"] **(DL-28), \u00b6** 70; *TECO* **(AL-027), \u00b6** 81.\n\n228.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that the right to be heard and to be able to present one\u2019s case is a fundamental principle encompassed within Article 52(1)(d). The Committee therefore has to determine whether the Tribunal has violated the Applicant\u2019s right to be heard in delivering its Award. The Committee should be concerned with the essential fairness of the proceedings.233 Another important consideration is whether the breach is serious and \"could potentially have affected the award.\"234\n\n*CDC Group* **(AL-0009), \u00b6** 49.\n\n*TECO* **(AL-027), \u00b6** 85.\n\n229.\n\nThe Committee also refers to the annulment decision in *Vivendi235* where the committee held as follows:\n\n*[u]nder Article 52(1)(d), the emphasis is clearly on the term \"rule of procedure, \" that is, on the manner in which the Tribunal proceeded, not on the content of its decision.*\n\n*Vivendi I* **(AL-025), \u00b6** 83.\n\n230.\n\nIn the *MINE* annulment decision,236 it was held that for this ground of annulment to be operative, the departure from the rule of procedure must be a \"serious one\" and the rule of procedure which is breached must be \"fundamental.\"\n\n*MINE* **(AL-006), \u00b6** 4.06.\n\n231.\n\nIn the *Wena Hotels* annulment decision237 it was held that:\n\n*In order to be a \"serious\" departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.*\n\n*Wena Hotels* **(DL-3), \u00b6** 58.\n\n232.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the standard set out in the decisions that the Committee has referred to in the preceding paragraphs. The Committee will now apply those principles to determine whether the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure as alleged by Gambrinus.\n\n**(2) The alleged annullable error**\n------------------------------------\n\n233.\n\nThe Applicant contends that the introduction of the JIA Defense during the first day of the Arbitration Hearing on March 10, 2014 breached a fundamental procedural principle of equality of treatment and equal right to be heard and that this created a fundamental imbalance at the Arbitration Hearing, namely that the Respondent was able to present arguments and evidence on the JIA Defense whilst the Claimant was deprived of that opportunity. The Applicant further contends that the post-hearing procedure did not rectify the prejudice caused by that imbalance.\n\n234.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that in order to determine whether the submissions of the Applicant can constitute a breach of Article 52(1)(d), it is necessary to consider what transpired before, during and after the Arbitration Hearing.\n\n***a. Pre-Hearing Developments***\n---------------------------------\n\n235.\n\nGambrinus filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction Merits and Quantum on November 30, 2012 accompanied by a witness statement of Mr. Reinaldo Gabaldon and an expert report which evidenced that Polar had agreed to transfer its shares in Fertinitro to Gambrinus for USD 80 million pursuant to the Share Purchase Agreement.\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction Merits and Quantum on May 17, 2013 which was accompanied by witness statements, legal opinions and a valuation report.\n\n237.\n\nGambrinus filed its Reply on Merits and its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on August 30, 2013 accompanied by a witness statement, legal opinion and an expert report and a valuation report.\n\n238.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, Merits and Quantum on November 29, 2013 accompanied by witness statements as well as legal opinions and a valuation report.\n\n239.\n\nGambrinus filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on January 17, 2014 accompanied by a witness statement and a valuation report.\n\n240.\n\nThe contention of the Respondent is that the Applicant produced no evidence of its title in its Request for Arbitration, as the only exhibit relating to share transfer was the Notice of Waiver dated January 22, 2008.\n\n241.\n\nThe Respondent contends that when the Memorial of the Applicant dated November 30, 2012 was filed, the Applicant produced the Share Purchase Agreement which provided a transfer of the shares to Gambrinus for a price of USD 80 million to be paid at a future date. The Respondent contends that Gambrinus in its Counter-Memorial of May 17, 2013 produced the Common Share Subscription Agreement.\n\n242.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Gambrinus in its Rejoinder of January 17, 2014 admitted that a share-for-share transaction had taken place and that no cash had been paid and that this was confirmed by the Applicant\u2019s counsel.\n\n243.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that the issue of whether Gambrinus had paid for the shares in cash within the meaning of Section 6.7(i) of the JIA was an important issue pertaining to jurisdiction. It should have been one of the principal issues that the Respondent should have considered when the arbitration commenced. The issue that the Committee has to consider is whether the fact that the Tribunal considered the JIA Defense despite being raised for the first time on March 10, 2014 during the Arbitration Hearing constitutes a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d). This necessitates a consideration of what transpired at the Arbitration Hearing which commenced on March 10, 2014.\n\n***b. March 10, 2014- Day 1***\n------------------------------\n\n244.\n\nOn February 17,2014, Gambrinus indicated that it was not necessary to call Mr. Haberman and Dr. Garcia Montoya for examination. The Hearing commenced on March 10, 2014 with the Claimant\u2019s opening presentation. Gambrinus\u2019 counsel addressed the Common Share Subscription Agreement and argued that it did not matter whether cash or economic detriment was sustained by Gamrbinus on January 24, 2008 or in February 2008 when shares-for-shares were issued.\n\n245.\n\nGambrinus\u2019 counsel was specifically asked by the Chairman of the Tribunal whether the sum of USD 80 million was actually paid by Gambrinus. Gambrinus\u2019 counsel\u2019s response was that cash was not paid but what was done was that the assets were acquired by Gambrinus in exchange for shares.238\n\nTr. 2014, Day 1, page 74:9-18 (A-43).\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent in addressing the 2008 Transfer submitted that this raised a jurisdictional issue, namely, that there was no investment and the Tribunal had no jurisdiction. Venezuela relied on the provisions of Section 6.7 of the JIA which required that \"any disposition shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalent to the exclusion of any other consideration.\"\n\n247.\n\nGambrinus\u2019 counsel intervened at that point to state that the issue of non-compliance with Section 6.7 of the JIA had not been specifically pleaded and that this was a new argument. Gambrinus took the view that this new argument could be addressed through proper briefing during closing arguments and written memorials.239\n\n*Id.,* page 174:7-17 **(A-43).**\n\n***c. March 11, 2014 - Day 2***\n-------------------------------\n\n248.\n\nGambrinus took the view that the Respondent had to make a formal application to raise this new argument in view of the provisions of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n249.\n\nThe Arbitration Hearing before the Tribunal proceeded with the examination of Mr. Gabaldon and objections were raised by the Gambrinus\u2019 counsel with regard to questions posed by Venezuela which Gambrinus submitted were in respect of the \"new\" argument.\n\n***d. March 12, 2014 - Day 3***\n-------------------------------\n\n250.\n\nThere appears to have been a dialogue between the Parties and discussions had taken place as to how the post-hearing arrangements could address the JIA Defense. Gambrinus\u2019 counsel then informed the Tribunal that there had been a \"constructive dialogue\" and that discussions were taking place about the timing and structure of the post-hearing briefing.240\n\nTr. 2014, Day 3, page 237 **(A-45).**\n\n251.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s counsel formally applied to raise the JIA Defense. The Tribunal having heard arguments, adjourned and deliberated and handed down its decision in the following manner:\n\n*The Tribunal considers that Respondent, in particular in its rejoinder in paragraph 63, has addressed the issue of the lack of payment by Gambrinus of the agreed sum to Polar as required by the share transfer agreement.*\n\n*However, the Tribunal considers the reference made by Respondent in its opening submission to the failure by Claimant to comply with the terms of Article 6.* 7 *of the joint investors\u2019 agreement, resulting, according to Respondent, in Claimant\u2019s failure to achieve valid title to the Fertinitro shares, is a new argument which, as such, was not allowed under paragraph 13.9 of Procedural Order No. 1.*\n\n*Under paragraph 13.10 of the same order, any supplement by the parties of their written submission must be authorised by the Tribunal.*\n\n*Having considered Respondent\u2019s request to be authorised to deal with the described new argument, as well as Claimant\u2019s objection under its letter of March 14th 2014, the Tribunal has decided to grant the Respondent the requested authorisation.*\n\n*That is our decision. All this is on record. Both Claimant and Respondent will be able, if they so wish, to deal with this new argument tomorrow in their closing, and certainly in the further steps of the proceeding, including post-hearing briefs.241*\n\n*Id.,* 251:3-25, 252:1-3 (A-45).\n\n***e. March 13, 2014 - Day 4***\n-------------------------------\n\n252.\n\nHaving presented their closing arguments, the Parties mutually agreed on the procedure by which the JIA Defense would be dealt with.242\n\nTr. 2014, Day 4 page 41 (A-46).\n\n253.\n\nThe Chairman of the Tribunal addressed the Parties on the procedural steps with regard to closing statements and post-hearing submissions. He also invited the Parties to confer and agree on issues. The Chairman also requested the Parties to agree to a Joint List of Questions which the Parties wished to be addressed in the Award.\n\n254.\n\nOn March 18, 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 which formally restated the agreement reached by the Parties at the end of the hearing. The relevant parts of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2 read as follows:\n\n*WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS ON THE \"NEW ARGUMENT\"*\n\n*By Friday, 16 May 2014, Respondent shall file a written submission of maximum twenty (20) pages, accompanied by nothing more than a legal opinion, on the question of the validity under Venezuelan law of the purported share transfer of 24 January 2008. The legal opinion shall be brief, but need not be restricted to the twenty-page limitation.*\n\n*By Friday, 18 July 2014, Claimant shall file a written submission of the same length (i.e. 20 pages), addressing Respondent\u2019s submission of 16 May 2014, as identified above. Claimant\u2019s submission may also be accompanied by a brief legal opinion and nothing more.*\n\n*POST-HEARING BRIEFS*\n\n*On Friday, 29 August 2014, the Parties shall file simultaneous post-hearing briefs, of no more than fifty (50) pages.*\n\n*By no later than Friday, 26 September 2014, the Parties shall file simultaneous post-hearing reply briefs of no more than thirty (30) pages.*\n\n*With the post-hearing reply briefs, the Parties will submit an agreed upon list of questions that they consider shall be addressed by the Tribunal for purposes of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention.*\n\n255.\n\nOn October 1, 2014, and pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2, the Parties submitted the Joint List of Questions that should be addressed by the Tribunal for purposes of Article 48 of the ICSID Convention. There were 16 questions to be addressed.243\n\nJoint List of Questions **(A-59).**\n\n256.\n\nThe issue that arises for the Committee to consider is whether Gambrinus through its counsel having agreed on the procedure for the new point to be raised, can now contend that they were \"ambushed\" and that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n257.\n\nThe chronology of events clearly indicates that the Applicant agreed consensually to the procedure by which the JIA Defense was to be addressed by the Tribunal. It is therefore the Committee\u2019s view that there is no basis for the Applicant to characterise the procedure they agreed as one in which they were \"ambushed.\"\n\n258.\n\nThe Committee is also of the view that Gambrinus was accorded ample opportunity to address the JIA Defense. There were legal opinions submitted by Dr. Garcia Montoya on behalf of Venezuela. Gambrinus submitted the legal opinion of Mr. Rodner which was 45 pages together with 56 exhibits.\n\n259.\n\nGiven the Committee\u2019s prior findings that Gambrinus consented without any qualification to the procedure to present its arguments to address the JIA Defense and that such procedure provided ample opportunity to address it, in the Committee\u2019s view, there is in the circumstances no serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.\n\n260.\n\nAnother one of the arguments raised by Gambrinus is that the JIA Defense was raised very late in the day and hence the Tribunal could have already commenced its deliberations. This is mere speculation on the part of Gambrinus as there is no evidence to support that the Tribunal had, prior to issuing its Procedural Order No. 2, in any way, deliberated on the JIA Defense. The Committee is of the view that if Gambrinus was of the view that it needed more time, then it should not have agreed to the timetable and the procedure that was proposed and should have objected. The proceedings indicate that Gambrinus did not register any such objection but had actually reached a consensus with Venezuela as to how to deal with the JIA Defense. The Tribunal was cognisant of the fact that the Respondent had raised a new argument and gave Gambrinus an opportunity to present its arguments to the contrary.\n\n261.\n\nThe Committee is also of the view that the procedure that was agreed to by the Parties, as enshrined in the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2, does not in any way violate fundamental rules of procedure. The Applicant was given every opportunity to present its case as to why it had complied with the provisions of Section 6.7 of the JIA. The conduct of the Tribunal in permitting a new argument to be raised with the consent of both Parties is not a ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n262.\n\nThe Applicant has also argued that the Tribunal wrongly permitted the introduction of IAS 7 and therefore committed a breach of the Tribunal\u2019s Procedural Order No. 2 and this constituted an annullable error within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d). The Tribunal did not rely on IAS 7 in order to reach its conclusion on whether the cash equivalency requirement was complied with. There is therefore, in the Committee\u2019s view, no breach of Article 52(1)(d) by the Tribunal in respect of this allegation.\n\n263.\n\nThe Committee relies on the words of the annulment committee in *MINE v Guinea* which reads as follows:\n\n*A first comment on this provision concerns the term \"serious \". In order to constitute a ground for annulment the departure from a \"fundamental rule of procedure \" must be serious. The Committee considers that this establishes both quantitative and qualitative criteria: the departure must be substantial and be such as to deprive a party of the benefit or protection which the rule was intended to provide.*\n\n*A second comment concerns the term \"fundamental\": even a serious departure from a rule of procedure will not give rise to annulment, unless that rule is \"fundamental\". The Committee considers that a clear example of such a fundamental rule is to be found in Article 18 of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration which provides: \"The parties shall be treated with equality and each party shall be given full opportunity of presenting his case. \" The term \"fundamental rule of procedure \" is not to be understood as necessarily including all of the Arbitration Rules adopted by the Centre.244*\n\n*MINE* **(AL-006), \u00b6\u00b6** 5.05-5.06\n\n264.\n\nThe statement of the annulment committee in *Wena Hotels* is also relevant.\n\n*In order to be a \"serious\" departure from a fundamental rule of procedure, the violation of such a rule must have caused the Tribunal to reach a result substantially different from what it would have awarded had such a rule been observed.245*\n\n*Wena Hotels* **(DL-3), \u00b6** 58.\n\n265.\n\nThe Committee is of the view that there is no merit in the Applicant\u2019s contention that there was a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure under Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**a. Gambrinus\u2019 Statement of Costs**\n------------------------------------\n\n266.\n\nPursuant to its submission on costs dated March 12, 2017, the Applicant has incurred the following costs in connection with this annulment proceedings:\n\nProfessional fees (consisting of attorney time) USD 460,473.35\n\nOut of Pocket disbursements USD 63,360.91\n\nTOTAL USD 523,834.26\n\n**b. Venezuela\u2019s Statement of Costs**\n-------------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nPursuant to its submissions on costs dated March 10, 2017, the Respondent has incurred the following costs in connection with this annulment proceedings:\n\nHogan Lovells\u2019 Fees and Disbursements USD 1,052,363.00\n\nDisbursements USD 84,588.00\n\nTOTAL USD 1,136,951.00\n\n**c. Committee\u2019s Decision**\n---------------------------\n\n268.\n\nPursuant to Article 52(4) of the ICSID Convention, Chapter VI of the ICSID Convention, including Article 61(2), shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to the proceedings before this Committee. According to Rule 53 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, \"[t]he provisions of these Rules shall apply *mutatis mutandis* to any procedure relating to the interpretation, revision or annulment of an award and to the decision of the Tribunal or Committee.\"\n\n269.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\n*In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid....*\n\n270.\n\nIn exercise of its discretion under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Committee has the authority to decide on an appropriate allocation of costs in the present proceedings.\n\n271.\n\nRule 47(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules provides that the tribunal\u2019s award \"shall contain [...] (j) any decision [...] regarding the cost of the proceeding.\"\n\n272.\n\nRegulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations further provides that in annulment proceedings:\n\n*[...] the applicant shall be solely responsible for making the advance payments requested by the Secretary-General to cover expenses following the constitution of the Committee, and without prejudice to the right of the Committee in accordance with Article 52(4) of the Convention to decide how and by whom expenses incurred in connection with the annulment proceeding shall be paid.*\n\n273.\n\nThe Applicant in seeking annulment of the Award, has been responsible for making all the advance payments to cover the costs of the Committee and the Centre. The Committee has discretion to decide on the final allocation of these costs of the proceeding, as well as of the costs incurred by the Parties in respect of their legal representation in this annulment proceeding.\n\n274.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Committee order the Applicant to bear the costs of the proceedings as well as the Respondent\u2019s legal costs and expenses in full based on the following arguments:\n\n\u2022 the annulment proceedings were unnecessary and there were no merits in the Applicant\u2019s claims; and\n\n\u2022 there was a misuse of the annulment proceedings.\n\n275.\n\nThe Committee cannot agree with the Respondent that Gambrinus\u2019 Application for Annulment was unnecessary. The ICSID Convention explicitly provides for the right to seek annulment. The Committee is not convinced that there is any illegitimacy in the Applicant\u2019s motives to seek annulment in the present case.\n\n276.\n\nThe Committee in the exercise of its discretion sees no justification for ordering the Applicant to bear the legal costs and expenses that the Respondent has incurred in connection with this annulment proceedings.246\n\nThe Committee concludes that Gambrinus\u2019 Application for Annulment cannot be considered \"fundamentally lacking in merit\", or \"to any reasonable and impartial observer, most unlikely to succeed.\" CDC Group, \u00b6 89.\n\n277.\n\nThe Committee agrees with the recent trend in ICSID cases that it is generally reasonable for a party whose application has been rejected in its entirety to bear the costs of the proceeding in full. There are no special circumstances that would warrant a different conclusion in the present case. The Committee is of the view that the Applicant shall bear all costs of the proceeding, consisting of the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre.\n\n278.\n\nThe costs of the annulment proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):\n\nCommittee Members\u2019 fees and expenses\n\nTan Sri Dato' Cecil W.M. Abraham 93,006.17\n\nAmbassador Hussein A. Hassouna 77,098.06\n\nDoctor Michael Pryles 67,168.06\n\nICSID\u2019s administrative fees 64,000.00\n\nDirect expenses (estimated)247 46,348.67\n\n**Total** **347,620.96****248**\n\nThis amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Decision on Annulment (courier, printing and copying).\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\n279.\n\nThe Applicant has advanced the entire amount of the costs of the proceeding pursuant to Regulation 14(3)(e) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations and hence no reimbursement order is required.\n\n**VII. DECISION**\n-----------------\n\n280.\n\nFor the reasons referred to above, the Committee issues the following decision:\n\n(1) The Applicant\u2019s request for annulment of the Award rendered on June 15, 2015 in ICSID Case No. ARB/11/31 is denied.\n\n(2) Each Party shall bear its own legal costs and expenses incurred in connection with this annulment proceeding.\n\n(3) The Applicant shall bear the total costs of the proceedings, consisting of the fees and expenses of the members of the Committee and the charges for the use of the ICSID facilities.\n\n(4) All other requests by the Parties are dismissed."}]}
