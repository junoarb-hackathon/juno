PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND**\n----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe present order deals with an application filed by the Republic of Guinea (the \"Respondent\" or \"Guinea\") on 30 April 2015 (the \"Application\"), by which the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order (i) on the basis of Article 28(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"Arbitration Rules\"), that BSG Resources Limited (the \"Claimant\" or \"BSGR\") bear all the cost advances during the pendency of these proceedings and reimburse the first advance paid by the Respondent, (ii) on the basis of Article 39(1) of the Arbitration Rules, a provisional measure requiring the Claimant to post security for costs in the form of an irrevocable guarantee in the amount of \u20ac 3 million, and (iii) that BSG bear all costs incurred in connection with the Application. The Application was accompanied with 51 factual exhibits (Exhs. R-1 to R-51) and 11 legal authorities (Exhs. RL-1 to RL-11).\n\n2.\n\nIn conformity with the procedural schedule set in paragraph 26.2 of Procedural Order No. 1, the Claimant filed its response to the Application on 5 June 2015 (the \"Response\"), in which it requested the Tribunal to reject the Respondent's requests and to award it the costs incurred for responding to the Application. The Claimant further stated that, in its view, the Application was straightforward and did not require a hearing, although it remained at the disposal of the Tribunal for further oral explanations at a hearing if required. The Response was accompanied with 47 factual exhibits (Exhs. C-28 to C-74) and 26 legal authorities (Exhs. CL-3 to CL-28).\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent filed its reply on 12 June 2015 accompanied with 13 factual exhibits (Exhs. R-52 to R-64) (the \"Reply\"). In addition to reiterating its requests for advance payments and security for costs, the Respondent further indicated that factual exhibits C-68 to C-74 were confidential, thus requesting these exhibits as well as paragraph 60 of the Response not to be published as long as the criminal investigation in Guinea was ongoing.1 The Respondent did not ask for a hearing on the Application.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 60 and 107, point 3.\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant filed its rejoinder on 19 June 2015 accompanied with 6 factual exhibits (Exhs. C-75 to C-80) and one legal authority (Exh. CL-29) (the \"Rejoinder\"), in which it reiterated its position as set out in the Response.\n\n5.\n\nOn 11 August 2015, the Claimant sent a letter to the Tribunal seeking leave to file one additional legal authority into the record, namely the Decision on the Parties' Requests for Provisional Measures dated 23 June 2015 in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/14 *EuroGas Inc. and Belmont Resources Inc. v. Slovak Republic* (the \"*Eurogas* decision\"). In compliance with ICSID's email of 14 August 2015, the Claimant filed the *Eurogas* decision together with brief comments on 21 August and the Respondent provided its comments on 28 August.\n\n**II. POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES**\n--------------------------------\n\n**1. Position of the Respondent**\n---------------------------------\n\n6.\n\nThe Application contains two requests: that the Claimant pay all advances for the Tribunal's and the Centre's fees and expenses, including the reimbursement of the Respondent's first advance payment in the amount of US$ 125'000 (a. below); and that the Tribunal order the Claimant to post security for costs in the amount of \u20ac 3 million (b. below).\n\n7.\n\nWith reference to other ICSID cases, the Respondent submits that, notwithstanding the Tribunal's lack of competence to entertain the merits of the Claimant's case, the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction to order the requested measures on the basis of Article 28(1)(a) and 39(1) of the Arbitration Rules.2\n\nApplication, \u00b6 10, referring to *Victor Pey Casado and Foundation President Allende v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on provisional measures requested by the Parties, 25 September 2001, \u00b6\u00b6 6-8 (Exh. RL-1); *Tokios Tokel\u00e9s v. Ukraine*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/18, Order No. 1, Claimant's Request for Provisional Measures, 1 July 2003, \u00b6 6 (Exh. RL-2); *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/05, Decision on Provisional Measures, 6 April 2007, \u00b6 29 (Exh. RL-3), quoting *Holiday Inn S.A. et al. v. Morocco*, ICSID Case No. ARB/72/1, Decision of 2 July 1972; Reply, \u00b6 11.\n\n8.\n\nRegarding more specifically the request for security for costs, the Respondent relies on *RSM v. St. Lucia* and *Phoenix v. Czech Republic* to argue that it has a legitimate interest in obtaining such security even if the Tribunal were to lack competence *ratione materiae* over the dispute, since the Tribunal's award denying jurisdiction could hold the Claimant liable for all the costs generated by the present proceedings.3\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13, referring to *RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on St. Lucia's Request for Security for Costs, 13 August 2014, \u00b6 59 (Exh. RL-4) and *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. The Czech Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/05, Award, 15 April 2009, \u00b6\u00b6 145-152.\n\n**a. Advances on costs**\n------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn the basis of Articles 61(2) of the ICSID Convention, Regulation 14(3)(d) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations, and Article 28(1)(a) of the Arbitration Rules, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimant to pay all cost advances during these present proceedings and to reimburse the first advance payment of US$ 125'000 made by the Respondent. In reply to the Claimant's argument that the Respondent has twice consented to pay half of the advances on costs (by paying the first advance and accepting Article 10.1 of Procedural Order No. 1), the Respondent contends that those facts have no repercussion on its request, which was announced at the first session held on 23 April 2015 (the \"First Session\") and thus before Procedural Order No. 1 was issued.4\n\nReply, \u00b6 15.\n\n10.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Tribunal has discretionary power to decide \"at any time\" on the apportionment of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal as well as the charges of the Centre.5 Such power should be exercised when there is \"good cause\".6 Contrary to the Claimant's view, the \"good cause\" criterion established in *RSM v. St. Lucia* should not be mistaken for the particular circumstances of that case.7 For the Respondent, three grounds provide good cause for the Claimant to pay all cost advances in the present proceedings, namely (i) the exploitation of these arbitral proceedings by the Claimant, (ii) the health crisis in connection with the Ebola outbreak in Guinea, and (iii) the lack of merit of the Claimant's claims.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 18-24; Reply, \u00b6 14.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 24, referring to *RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on St. Lucia's Request for Security for Costs, 13 August 2014, \u00b6 76 (Exh. RL-4)\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 19-25.\n\n**(i) The Claimant's exploitation of the arbitral proceedings**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n11.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimant's conduct shows that it seeks to prolong the proceedings as much as possible, as part of its media campaign targeting the Respondent's intention to reattribute the mining rights in dispute.8 The Respondent points to various examples, such as a series of public statements made since 2013 by BSGR containing threats to resort to arbitration; the Claimant's misleading press statement of 7 May 2014 indicating that it had \"filed\" a request before ICSID; and a piece published in the Sunday Times on 1 June 2014, based exclusively on BSGR's declarations.9 In addition, the Claimant has announced its intention to start new proceedings against Guinea on the same facts as the case at hand.10\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 37-38; Exhs. R-53 to R-55.\n\nReply, \u00b6 39; Exh. R-56.\n\n12.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that the Claimant has shown a \"dilatory attitude\" and has seized every opportunity to delay the proceedings since it filed its Request for Arbitration.11 Moreover, despite the fact that the Claimant had stated in the Request for Arbitration that it intended to request provisional measures to prevent the Respondent from disposing of the disputed mining rights, it was unable to respond to the Tribunal's related question at the First Session, thus confirming that the Claimant was not facing a situation of urgency.12\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 35-36; Reply, \u00b6 33.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 37; Reply, \u00b6 34.\n\n13.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent submits that there is a persistent incoherence between the Claimant's aggressiveness in its public declarations and its wait-and-see approach towards these arbitral proceedings.13 In the Respondent's view, it should not have to bear the costs of a procedure which the Claimant is manifestly protracting so as to foster its media campaign.14\n\nReply, \u00b6 41.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 39.\n\n**(ii) The Respondent's budgetary constraints due to the Ebola crisis**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nFor the Respondent, the exploitation of these proceedings by the Claimant is compounded by the fact that Guinea's \"precarious\" financial situation has been put under increasing strain by the Ebola crisis.15 While it acknowledges that its development prospects are positive,16 Guinea is ranked among the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and Least Developed Countries by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the United Nations.17 In 2012, more than half of the population lived below the poverty line and extreme poverty reached 18%. In 2013, Guinea's GDP was US$ 6.144 billion and, while the growth rate was projected to reach 4,5% in 2014, the Ebola crisis resulted in halving that rate.18\n\nApplication, \u00b6 40.\n\nReply, \u00b6 43.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 41; Exhs, R-18 and R-19.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 45.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent further explains that since 2010 the country has undergone reforms to foster good governance in the natural resources sector, and reached the \"completion point\" allowing it to benefit from debt relief measures.19 Notwithstanding this, Guinea is suffering from the violent Ebola epidemic requiring substantial financial resources. Specifically, Guinea had to set aside US$ 70 million in 2014.20 While the Respondent has shown its disposition that this arbitration be conducted in an orderly fashion, by paying the cost advances requested so far, it claims that the sums required for conducting the present arbitration would be put to better use in financing the fight against poverty and the Ebola epidemic.21\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 48.\n\n16.\n\nIn response to the Claimant's criticisms on Guinea's handling of the Ebola crisis and the retention of two international law firms to represent its interests in these proceedings, the Respondent dismisses both arguments as inappropriate, imprudent and inapposite.22\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 45-48.\n\n**(iii) The Respondent's serious defense on the merits**\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nFor the Respondent, the reallocation of advances is further justified because it has \"serious elements\" for its defense on the merits, in particular in light of the exceptionally strong evidence that BSGR obtained the disputed mining rights through an intricate \"corruption scheme\", confirmed by sound proof and Ms. Tour\u00e9's witness statements.23 Whereas the Claimant contends that Ms. Tour\u00e9's written testimony is contradicted by evidence given by third parties, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's interpretation of that evidence. Moreover, the depositions filed by the Claimant are part of confidential criminal proceedings, in which the Claimant is not involved and to which it should have no access. Given the impact which the publication of these depositions could have on the ongoing criminal investigation, the Respondent requests that Exhs. C-68 to C-74 and paragraph 60 of the Claimant's Response not be published.24\n\nApplication, \u00b6 51; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 53-62.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 59-61.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the seriousness of the issues before the Tribunal is confirmed by the multiplicity of criminal proceedings concerning the same acts of corruption which are currently pending in the United States, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.25 In addition, BSGR's partner Vale S.A. has begun an arbitration against BSGR at the London Court of International Arbitration26 and Rio Tinto, the first holder of the disputed mining rights, has started proceedings against BSGR in the United States.27\n\nApplication, \u00b6 53; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 65-66.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 54.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 55.\n\n19.\n\nWhile the Respondent concedes that the Tribunal is not called upon at this stage to rule on the merits of its arguments, it submits that there can be \"no doubt\" that its defense rests on serious arguments and conclusive evidence.28 At any rate, the \"exceptional circumstances\" presented in the previous paragraphs constitute at the very least \"good cause\" justifying the Respondent's request on advance payments.29\n\nApplication, \u00b6 57; Reply, \u00b6 67.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59.\n\n**b. Security for costs**\n-------------------------\n\n20.\n\nGuinea also requests security for costs in the amount of \u20ac 3 million so as to preserve the Respondent's right to recover the expenses incurred in connection with these proceedings.30\n\nApplication, \u00b6 60.\n\n21.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Application meets the relevant test and that the Tribunal is competent under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Article 39(1) of the Arbitration Rules31 because (i) the requested measure aims at preserving the right of Guinea to the reimbursement of its costs, (ii) in circumstances rendering such preservation necessary and (iii) it is urgent.32 Finally, the Respondent submits that the requested amount is reasonable (iv).\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 62-65, referring to *RSM Production Corporation et al. v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Application for Security for Costs, 14 October 2010, \u00b6 5.5 (Exh. RL-7); Reply, \u00b6 71.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 67, referring to *Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.a. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00f9n v. Plurinational State of Bolivia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2, Decision on Provisional Measures, 1 February 2010, \u00b6 113 (Exh. RL-8); *Churchill Mining PLC and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Procedural Order No. 9, Provisional Measures, 8 July 2014, \u00b6 69 (Exh. RL-9).\n\n**(i) The preservation of the right to the reimbursement of the Respondent's costs**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the possibility of recovering its costs at the end of arbitral proceedings is a procedural right that may find protection by way of provisional measures. As confirmed by the *RSM* tribunal, the hypothetical nature of a costs award is not a bar to ordering provisional measures.33 The restrictive interpretation of *Maffezini v. Spain*, relied upon by the Claimant to show that hypothetical future rights are too speculative to merit protection, has been plainly rejected by ICSID tribunals since.34\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69, referring to *RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on St. Lucia's Request for Security for Costs, 13 August 2014, \u00b6 66 (Exh. RL-4).\n\nReply, \u00b6 83-86, referring to *Victor Pey Casado and Foundation President Allende v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on provisional measures requested by the Parties, 25 September 2001, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48, 80 (Exh. RL-1); *RSM Production Corporation et al. v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Application for Security for Costs, 14 October 2010, \u00b6 5.8 (Exh. RL-7); *RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on St. Lucia's Request for Security for Costs, 13 August 2014, \u00b6 72 (Exh. RL-4).\n\n23.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the evidence of corruption creates a real probability that the Claimant will be ordered to pay the Respondent's costs at the end of the proceedings.35\n\nApplication, \u00b6 70.\n\n**(ii) Exceptional circumstances make security for costs necessary**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe Respondent acknowledges that the provisional measure requested is rarely granted and requires \"exceptional circumstances\", although no rules define such circumstances. The tribunal in *RSM v. St. Lucia* distinguished clearly between the test of \"exceptional circumstances\" and the actual facts of a given case that may meet that test. Different sets of facts may therefore meet the test.36\n\nReply, \u00b6 75-80.\n\n25.\n\nSecurity for costs, so says the Respondent, has been deemed necessary in the face of a proven risk of default.37 ICSID tribunals have accepted that exceptional circumstances existed in case of (i) insolvency, financial difficulties or insufficient assets, (ii) a single claimant, as opposed to cases with several claimants which may be found jointly liable for the reimbursement of costs, (iii) corporate restructuring, or (iv) third party funding.38\n\nApplication, \u00b6 72.\n\nApplication, \u00b6 73, citing *RSM Production Corporation et al. v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Application for Security for Costs, 14 October 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 5.20-5.24 (Exh. RL-7); *Commerce Group Corp. & San Sebastian Gold Mines, Inc. v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/17, Decision on El Salvador's Application for Security for Costs, 20 September 2012, \u00b6 48 (Exh. CL-18) and *RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on St. Lucia's Request for Security for Costs, 13 August 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 82-83 (Exh. RL-4).\n\n26.\n\nFor the Respondent, there are three circumstances that, combined, amount to a real risk that the Claimant will not comply with a potential order for costs:\n\n\u2022 First, the corporate structure and financial situation of BSGR imply a risk of insolvency as a result of the lack of transparency regarding the assets of this holding company.39\n\n\u2022 Second, the Claimant's ability to honor a potential award on costs is questionable given the multiple proceedings pending against the Claimant, which will presumably end before the present arbitration. The Respondent argues that BSGR is \"probably\" going to be held liable for millions of US dollars in two proceedings and that criminal investigations in the United States may lead to the indictment of the company or its representatives. Other investigations in the United Kingdom and Switzerland will also have an impact on the financial situation of BSGR. In addition, the Claimant has carried out frequent recapitalizations as a result of the high debt of some of its subsidiaries.40\n\n\u2022 Third and last, the Respondent refers to the attitude of Mr. Beny Steinmetz, the ultimate beneficiary of the Claimant, towards his tax obligations and notes the investigations of the Israeli authorities regarding unpaid taxes. The Respondent also claims that Mr. Steinmetz has already started to shield his assets to avoid the enforcement of this Tribunal's award.41\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 74-75; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 91-92.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 76-77; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 93-97.\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 78-79; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 98-100.\n\n27.\n\nIn the light of these circumstances, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimant to post security for costs in the form of an irrevocable bank guarantee.42\n\nApplication, \u00b6 83.\n\n28.\n\nAs regards the *Eurogas* decision, Guinea asserts that it confirms the Tribunal's power to grant a bank guarantee as security for costs when there is a risk that the Claimant will become insolvent.43 While the tribunal in *Eurogas* decided against granting security and found that a claimant's financial difficulties are not necessarily exceptional circumstances, the facts here go beyond the financial difficulties of the Claimant and Mr. Steinmetz. They include (i) the fact that BSGR is the sole Claimant; (ii) the unusual accumulation of multiple arbitration and litigation proceedings (including criminal proceedings) against the Claimant, which could result in awards of several hundred million dollars; (iii) Mr. Steinmetz's conduct, such as his tax evasion maneuvers; and (iv) the Claimant's intent to file a second ICSID arbitration against Guinea.44 In the Respondent's submission, all these facts constitute particular circumstances \"without precedent\" and justify an order for security.45\n\nRespondent's comments on the *Eurogas decision*, \u00b6 11.\n\nRespondent's comments on the *Eurogas decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 5-8.\n\nRespondent's comments on the *Eurogas decision*, \u00b6 11.\n\n**(iii) The requested measure is urgent**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n29.\n\nRelying on case law, the Respondent submits that the urgency requirement is satisfied when the preservation of the Respondent's rights cannot await the issuance of the award.46 An order for security for costs is urgent given the need to protect the applicant's right to obtain reimbursement of its costs, prior to the issuance of the award. *In casu*, the multiple parallel proceedings and the manifold elements of corruption justify that the Claimant post security for costs.47 The Respondent further notes that the Claimant has not disputed that the urgency requirement is met.48\n\nApplication, \u00b6 84, citing *Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Procedural Order No. 1, 31 March 2006, \u00b6 76 (Exh. RL-11).\n\nApplication, \u00b6 87.\n\nReply, \u00b6 102.\n\n**(iv) The requested amount is reasonable**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n30.\n\nFinally, the Respondent vouches for the reasonableness of the requested guarantee in the amount of \u20ac 3 million. It corresponds to the Respondent's estimated fees and expenses in this arbitration in light of its complexity and the procedural calendar.49 In any event, the Respondent would only call on the guarantee for the amount of costs which the Tribunal may allocate to it.50\n\nApplication, \u00b6\u00b6 88-89.\n\nReply, \u00b6 105.\n\n**c. Costs relating to the Application**\n----------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent asks the Tribunal to order the Claimant to bear all costs related to the Application.51\n\nApplication, \u00b6 90; Reply, \u00b6 107.\n\n**2. Position of the Claimant**\n-------------------------------\n\n32.\n\nFor the Claimant, the Respondent's Application is \"wholly misconceived, without merit and a regrettable waste of resources\", lodged in the hope of painting a \"picture of distress\" so as to form a \"lasting impression\" on the Tribunal, thus seeking to \"subconsciously predispose it on the merits\".52 The sole circumstance on which the Respondent relies to support its requests, far from being extreme or exceptional, is a general risk that the Claimant will be unwilling or unable to pay costs. Yet this risk \"is inherent in any arbitration or litigation and it has never before justified the grant of measures that Guinea is seeking here.\"53 The only case in ICSID history where similar requests have been granted is *RSM v. St. Lucia*, in which there was a specific and proven risk of non-payment. By contrast, the Respondent's application is not based on incontrovertible evidence but on mere speculation and conjecture.54\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 3.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 4-6.\n\n**a. Advances on costs**\n------------------------\n\n33.\n\nFor the Claimant, if the Respondent's request on advances is upheld, this would require the Tribunal to set aside ICSID standard practice and the presumption enshrined in Article 14(3)(d) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations that each Party bears half of the advances on costs.55 While the Claimant accepts that the Tribunal may apportion advances as a matter of discretion, it notes that such power has been used only once in over 400 ICSID arbitration cases, in circumstances that were \"substantially different\" from those here.56\n\nResponse, \u00b6 10.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 12.\n\n34.\n\nThe *RSM v. St. Lucia* tribunal held that a different allocation of advance payments must rest on a \"good cause\" and found that the combination of four specific circumstances justified altering the allocation of advance payments. In essence, that tribunal found that RSM's record concerning payment of administrative expenses in two prior ICSID proceedings (failure to pay advances on costs and failure to pay costs awarded against it) raised substantial doubts about its willingness and/or ability to pay an award of costs. It also found that RSM was impecunious and third party funded, which constituted \"good cause\" to change the allocation of advances.57 None of these circumstances exist in the present case, since BSGR (i) has no track record of failing to pay advances on costs, (ii) has no track record of failing to pay costs awarded against it, (iii) is not impecunious, and (iv) is not funded by a third party.58 In addition, none of the three circumstances put forward by the Respondent \"come[] even close\" to the circumstances prevailing in *RSM v. St. Lucia*.59 The Claimant further argues that, contrary to the Respondent's understanding, it does not assert that the conditions in *RSM v. St. Lucia* are the only ones under which cost advances may be reallocated. Rather, it has analyzed those specific circumstances to show their exceptional nature and how high a threshold has been set.60\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 14-20, referring to *RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on St. Lucia's Request for Provisional Measures, 12 December 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 68-74 (Exh. CL-5).\n\nResponse, \u00b6 21.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 22.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 15.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimant also points to the fact that the Respondent's request, brought up during the First Session, contradicts its prior consent to pay its share of the first advance without reservation as well as the absence of any qualifications when filing its comments to Article 10.1 of draft Procedural Order No. 1.61 The discretionary power of an arbitral tribunal to reallocate advances other than in equal shares allows it to reassess the situation when circumstances change; in the present case, each of the circumstances now invoked by the Respondent \"was well-known to it from the start of this arbitration.\"62\n\nResponse, \u00b6 11; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 9-12.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 10.\n\n**(i) The Claimant's alleged exploitation of the arbitral proceedings**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimant denies that it has launched these proceedings in support of its media campaign to retain its mining rights. The motivation to retain its mining rights is not inappropriate, since restitution is an admissible remedy under both international and Guinean law. Moreover, public announcements are legitimate means used to preserve the *status quo* and avoid the aggravation of the dispute.63\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 23-28, referring to Article 35 of the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, 2001 (Exh.

RL-2); Rejoinder, \u00b6 21.\n\n37.\n\nIn addition, BSGR denies that it manipulates the media and contends that it has found itself in the center of a \"media storm\". Its press releases are not meant to exert pressure, but rather to restore its corporate image and tell its side of the story.64\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 33-42.\n\n38.\n\nIt further submits that its conduct in the arbitration has been perfectly reasonable and denies that it is seeking to protract these proceedings.65\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 36-43; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 23-31.\n\n39.\n\nAs regards the Respondent's allegation that the Claimant is duplicating proceedings, the Claimant admits that two of its subsidiaries have issued a Notice of Dispute on 9 April 2015, which is legally justified under the Zogota Base Convention. The Claimant denies that this constitutes abusive behavior and pledges that it \"will make every effort to consolidate or otherwise align the proceedings so as to conduct the arbitration(s) as cost and time efficient[ly] as possible.\"66\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 44.\n\n**(ii) The Respondent's alleged budgetary constraints**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimant fails to see the relevance of the Respondent's allegation that its financial means are limited, since the Respondent does not argue that it cannot cover the costs of arbitration, but that they would be \"better used\" to deal with Ebola instead.67\n\nResponse, \u00b6 44.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimant further stresses the promising economic forecast for Guinea and casts doubts on the handling and impact of the Ebola crisis.68 The Respondent has failed, so says BSGR, to submit a \"well proven case\" that it cannot otherwise pay its advances, and therefore there is no justification to depart from the general principle that each Party should bear its own advances.69\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 45-46; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 45-49.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 47.\n\n**(iii) The Respondent's alleged serious defense**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n42.\n\nFor the Claimant, the fact that the Respondent may have a plausible defense \"is a very long way from justifying dispensing with the principle of equal allocation of advances on costs\".70 Just as the *Maffezini* tribunal rejected security for costs based on the allegation of a strong defense, it would be improper here to prejudge the Respondent's corruption allegations by requiring the Claimant to pay all advances.71\n\nResponse, \u00b6 48.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50, referring to *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2, 28 October 1999, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21 (Exh. CL-14); *Guaracachi America and Rurelec v. Bolivia*, PCA Case No. 2011-17, Procedural Order No. 14, 11 March 2013, \u00b6 8 (Exh. CL-15).\n\n43.\n\nThe Claimant denies any wrongdoing or corruption and disputes Ms. Tour\u00e9's witness statements, which it describes as unreliable and contradictory.72 In connection with the other pending proceedings, neither BSGR nor Mr. Steinmetz or any of BSGR's employees or agents were the subject of the proceedings in the United States, the United Kingdom or Switzerland. Further, BSGR's joint venture partner Vale, so the Claimant says, most likely initiated LCIA proceedings against BSGR to protect its position.73\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 52-64.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 65-67.\n\n44.\n\nIn its Rejoinder, the Claimant added that it would not deal in that submission with Guinea's request that paragraph 60 of the Response and Exhs. C-68 to C-74 not be published, but reserved the right to do so in correspondence between the parties and the Tribunal. The Claimant did, however, note that the Respondent's concern about the integrity of the ongoing investigations could not be taken seriously when the Respondent itself published Ms. Tour\u00e9's witness statement of 2 December 2013 on its website.74\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 54, footnote 28.\n\n45.\n\nIn sum, the Claimant maintains that the Respondent has failed to show \"exceptional circumstances\" and \"good reason\" to obtain the relief it seeks, and the Tribunal should accordingly deny the request on advance payments.75\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 68-73.\n\n**b. Security for costs**\n-------------------------\n\n46.\n\nThe Claimant accepts the Tribunal's competence to grant security for costs, but argues that in accordance with unanimous ICSID case law, security can only be granted in \"exceptional circumstances\", if not \"in the most extreme case\".76 Eight of the nine ICSID tribunals requested to grant security for costs found no exceptional circumstances and denied the requests. They held that the applicant had to produce \"hard and concrete evidence\" as opposed to mere assertions and speculation.77 The only case in which security was granted was *RSM v. St. Lucia*, in which the claimant had repeatedly demonstrated its unwillingness and inability to pay costs and was funded by a third party. It is the cumulative effect of these facts that led the *RMS* tribunal to its stand-alone decision.78\n\nResponse, \u00b6 75, referring to *Emilio Agustin Maffezini v.

CL-5).\n\n47.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the recent *Eurogas* decision fully supports its position that security for costs should not be ordered but in exceptional, if not extreme, situations, adding to the series of negative ICSID decisions referred to in the Response and Rejoinder. The *Eurogas* decision confirms that a tribunal should not make a finding of exceptional circumstances \"lightly\"; that security cannot be granted on the ground of the claimant's financial hardship; and that an allegedly serious defense on the merits is irrelevant.79\n\nClaimant's comments on the *Eurogas decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.\n\n**(i) There are no exceptional circumstances justifying security for costs**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe Claimant's view is that its corporate structure is neither unusual nor exceptional. Moreover, the Claimant has been doing business in and with the Guinean Government since 2006. It had the same corporate structure when it was granted the mining rights. If this did not pose a problem then, it cannot reasonably be invoked to justify the security request now. Furthermore, as explained in *Libananco v. Albania*, the fact that an investor is a shell company without sufficient assets of its own is not a sufficient ground to order security.80\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 86-90; *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v. Republic of Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Decision on Preliminary Issues, 23 June 2008, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59 (Exh. CL-17).\n\n49.\n\nIn addition, the Claimant dismisses the suggestion that its structure would allow it to transfer assets to other companies of the group to frustrate the enforcement of an award as a mere conjecture based on hypothetical presumptions.81\n\nResponse, \u00b6 91.\n\n50.\n\nMoreover, BSGR argues that there is no direct relationship between an alleged lack of transparency of Guernsey holding companies and an inability or unwillingness to pay.82\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 68-69.\n\n51.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the risk of non-payment \"is built on speculation and doom scenarios only.\"83 Indeed, it has an excellent credit history and has never defaulted on its financial obligations. As to its balance sheet, BSGR notes that its \"total equity and total assets are close to US$ 700 million, with total liabilities just exceeding 10 million.\"84 In respect of the legal proceedings pending against it, the Claimant contends that there is no evidence that it will lose those proceedings, nor that it would become insolvent if it lost. There is no requirement to account for the claims filed by Vale and Rio Tinto as liabilities. Moreover, the restructuring of loans within the BSGR group referred to by the Respondent does not establish a risk of non-payment as it involves companies that are not parties to these proceedings.85\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 86.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 100.\n\nResponse, \u00b6 104; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 79-84.\n\n52.\n\nIn any event, ICSID jurisprudence shows that possible financial hardship of a claimant is a poor ground for requesting security for costs86 and Guinea does not invoke cases in which a lower threshold was applied.\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 94-99, citing *Burimi SRL and Eagle Games SH.A v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18, Procedural Order No. 2, 3 May 2012, \u00b6 41 (Exh. CL-16); *RSM Production Corporation et al. v.

RL-4).\n\n53.\n\nFinally, the Claimant insists that Mr. Steinmetz is not a party to these proceedings, he does not control BSGR's assets, and his personal financial affairs are therefore irrelevant. At any rate, so says the Claimant, the Respondent's allegations are false: Mr. Steinmetz's dispute with the Israeli tax authorities has been settled; he has not divested certain of his businesses \"and even if he did, he did so for proper business or personal purposes completely unrelated to the present arbitration.\"87\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 106-109, citing *RSM Production Corporation et al. v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Application for Security for Costs, 14 October 2010, \u00b6 5.24 (Exh. RL-7); Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 87-90.\n\n**(ii) Other considerations**\n-----------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Claimant also submits that the Tribunal should not prejudge cost allocation. In support of this submission, it cites *Maffezini v. Spain*, *Libananco v. Turkey* and *Burimi v. Albania*, according to which security should not be ordered because it would imply speculating that the Respondent will ultimately be granted costs.88\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 115-118, citing *Emilio Agust\u00edn Maffezini v. The Kingdom of Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/7, Procedural Order No. 2, 28 October 1999, \u00b6\u00b6 13; 15-18 (Exh. CL-14); *Libananco Holdings Co. Limited v.

Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18, Procedural Order No. 2, 3 May 2012, \u00b6 47 (Exh. CL-16).\n\n55.\n\nBSGR also claims that there is an inherent and systemic risk in investment arbitration which derives from the fact the State has consented to arbitration with investors that may be ultimately unwilling or unable to pay cost awards.89\n\nResponse, \u00b6\u00b6 120-123, citing *Burimi v. Albania*, *Burimi SRL and Eagle Games SH.A v. Republic of Albania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/18, Procedural Order No. 2, 3 May 2012, \u00b6 49 (Exh. CL-16) and *RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia*, Assenting Reasons attached to the Security for Costs Decision of Dr Gavan Griffith, 13 August 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 2-3 (Exh. RL-4).\n\n**(iii) Security amount**\n-------------------------\n\n56.\n\nThe Claimant considers that \u20ac 3 million to defend an ICSID case is not necessarily a reasonable figure, although it does not find it a shocking amount either. It criticizes the Respondent for seeking security for the entire amount of its estimated fees at once, instead of proceeding in stages throughout the arbitration, which would be a more sensible approach.90\n\nResponse, \u00b6 124.\n\n**c. Costs relating to the Application**\n----------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nIn line with its position that the Application is without merit, BSGR claims its costs to defend this request, irrespective of the outcome of the proceedings. In its Rejoinder, it notes that it awaits the Tribunal's directions as to the submission of its costs.91\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 97.\n\n**III. ANALYSIS**\n-----------------\n\n58.\n\nThis decision is made on the basis of the Tribunal's understanding of the record as it stands today. As a result, nothing herein shall preempt any later finding of fact or conclusion of law and any conclusion reached here could be revised if relevant circumstances were to change.\n\n**1. Cost advances**\n--------------------\n\n**a. Legal framework**\n----------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe rule in ICSID arbitration, as in many arbitration systems, is that the Parties pay the advances to finance the costs of the proceedings in equal shares and that the Tribunal determines the final allocation of costs in the award. Regulation 14(3)(d) of the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulations expresses this rule in the following terms:\n\n**Regulation 14**\n\n**Direct Costs of Individual Proceedings**\n\n[(3)(d)] in connection with every conciliation proceeding, and in connection with every arbitration proceeding unless a different division is provided for in the Arbitration Rules or is decided by the parties or the Tribunal, *each party shall pay one half of each advance* or supplemental charge, without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of an arbitration proceeding to be made by the Tribunal pursuant to Article 61(2) of the Convention. [\u2026] (Emphasis added)\n\n60.\n\nThe ICSID legal framework allows for exceptions to this rule, which require an agreement of the Parties (there is none here) or a decision of the tribunal. The Parties do not dispute the Tribunal's power in this respect, and rightly so. It is based on Regulation 14(3)(d) just quoted and on ICSID Arbitration Rule 28, which reads as follows:\n\n**Rule 28**\n\n**Cost of Proceeding**\n\n(1) Without prejudice to the final decision on the payment of the cost of the proceeding, the Tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, decide:\n\n(a) at any stage of the proceeding, the portion which each party shall pay, pursuant to Administrative and Financial Regulation 14, of the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre;\n\n(b) with respect to any part of the proceeding, that the related costs (as determined by the Secretary-General) shall be borne entirely or in a particular share by one of the parties.\n\n61.\n\nContrary to the Claimant's contention, the Tribunal considers that the request is admissible, although the Respondent did not raise it until the First Session and it knew since the start of the arbitration about the circumstances which it now invokes.\n\n62.\n\nAs was just seen, Regulation 14(3)(d) allows the Tribunal to deviate from the fifty-fifty apportionment of the advances which is the rule. This said, the ICSID legal framework provides no guidance on the test which the Tribunal should apply when considering allocating advances other than according to the fifty-fifty rule.\n\n63.\n\n*RSM v. St. Lucia* is the only ICSID case that has accepted to change the fifty-fifty division of advances. The *RSM* tribunal considered that a variation from the fifty-fifty rule required showing good cause. While it added that this standard is less stringent than the \"exceptional circumstances\" threshold applied in connection with provisional measures, it explained that it \"ha[d] no occasion here to conceive of and address what sort of circumstances might generally amount to \"good cause\" for varying the presumption that each Party advances one-half of ongoing administrative expenses.\"92 It thus focused its analysis on the specific circumstances of the case and was led to alter the presumptive allocation of advances as a result of a combination of circumstances, specifically \"(1) that Claimant's record concerning payment of these administrative expenses in two prior ICSID proceedings gives rise to substantial doubt about either its willingness or ability (or both) to pay any award of such expenses and (2) that, far from allaying these doubts, the circumstances of this proceeding thus far compound them.\"93 Consequently, the tribunal found that there was a \"reasonable inference\" that the Claimant would never pay the costs unless it was required to pay in advance.94\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on St. Lucia's Request for Provisional Measures, 12 December 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 49-50 (Exh. CL-5).\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v. St. Lucia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/10, Decision on St. Lucia's Request for Provisional Measures, 12 December 2013, \u00b6 74 (Exh. CL-5).\n\n**b. Is there \"good cause\" to reallocate advances on costs?**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Parties that the \"good cause\" standard outlined in *RSM v. St. Lucia* should not be mistaken for the particular circumstances of that case. The latter are certainly not the only possible circumstances under which advances on costs may be allocated other than in equal shares. Still, an assessment of the circumstances of that case shows that a departure from the fifty-fifty apportionment cost advance must rest on strong grounds and can only prevail in exceptional circumstances.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that such exceptional circumstances do exist in the present case. This is not due to its assessment of the merits of this case. Indeed, at this very early stage of the arbitration, it is difficult for the Tribunal to assess the likelihood of success of the Respondent's defenses. Doing so would entail entering into the substance of the issues and prejudging the merits of the respective positions at an early stage without the benefit of a full record. This would undoubtedly be at best an unsatisfactory exercise.\n\n66.\n\nNeither is the Tribunal's determination based on alleged dilatory tactic of BSGR. In fact, the Tribunal sees no indication of BSGR employing dilatory tactics in this arbitration in order to foster a media campaign to retain its mining rights. So far, the arbitration is unfolding at a normal pace for a complex investment arbitration. The examples cited by the Respondent do not show that the Claimant tries to put a spoke in the wheel.\n\n67.\n\nRather, the Tribunal's determination is based on the Respondent's argument pursuant to which, in view of its precarious situation, which is put under further strain due to the Ebola epidemic, its share of advances on costs of this arbitration should better go towards fighting the Ebola crisis and somewhat easing Guinea's budgetary constraints.\n\n68.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Guinea is ranked among the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries and Least Developed Countries by the IMF, the World Bank, and the United Nations, with more than 50% of the population living below the poverty line and 18% in extreme poverty (2012 figures). It also notes that, in addition to human distress, the Ebola crisis has caused significant losses to the economy and hence to fiscal resources. It has also considerably reduced the development and growth perspectives of the country (see in particular Exhs. R-18, R-21 and R-22).\n\n69.\n\nThe Tribunal is of course aware that the Claimant has opposed these arguments and has in particular stressed that the Respondent has retained two international firms as counsel; that it has not stated that it was unable to pay the advances; that its economic prospects are improving; and that it is not managing the health crisis and aid funds in an efficient manner. While there may be truth in these arguments, they do not change the fact that Guinea is one of the poorest countries in the world and that its budget is under major pressure as a result of the Ebola crisis. It is also true that respondent States do not have the initiative of starting arbitration proceedings. Rather, they are subject to the initiative and timing of the claimant, and it is true that investment arbitrations can place a non-negligible burden on the fiscal resources of States in low income economies.\n\n**c. Conclusion on advances**\n-----------------------------\n\n70.\n\nAs a result of these exceptional circumstances, the Tribunal determines that BSGR shall bear 75% of the advances on costs and Guinea 25%. This apportionment shall apply as from the second advance, being specified that Guinea's first advance payment shall not be refunded. For the avoidance of doubt, this determination is without prejudice of the Tribunal's final decision on the allocation of costs.\n\n**2. Security for costs**\n-------------------------\n\n**a. Legal framework**\n----------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Tribunal's authority to grant security for costs as a provisional measure is undisputed by the Parties. This authority stems from Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 39, which read as follows:\n\n**Article 47**\n\nExcept as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\n\n\\* \\* \\*\n\n**Rule 39**\n\n**Provisional Measures**\n\n(1) At any time after the institution of the proceeding a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights be recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n**b. Requirements for provisional measures**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nUnder Rule 39, an application for provisional measures must specify \"the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\" ICSID tribunals have interpreted these requirements to mean that provisional measures must (i) serve to protect certain rights of the applicant, (ii) be urgent, and (iii) be necessary, which implies the existence of a risk of irreparable or substantial harm.95\n\n*See Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Procedural Order No. 9, 6 September 2005, \u00b6 38 (Exh. CL-12); *Burlington Resources, Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Procedural Order No. 1, 29 June 2009, \u00b6 51; *Quiborax S.A., Non-Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v.

Romania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Decision on Claimants' Application for Provisional Measures, 2 March 2011, \u00b6 12.\n\n73.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that the applicant must establish the facts underlying the requirements with sufficient likelihood, without having to actually prove them at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n74.\n\nWhile the requirements are undisputed, the Parties disagree on their fulfillment in this case. In particular, the Parties disagree on the Respondent's right deserving protection (i) and on necessity (ii). By contrast, the Parties do not dispute that the Tribunal has *prima facie* jurisdiction to rule on provisional measures, even though the Respondent has announced that it will raise an objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\n**(i) Rights requiring preservation**\n-------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that its conditional right to the reimbursement of the Claimant's costs deserves protection. As found by the tribunals of *Pey Casado v. Chile, RSM v. Grenada,* and *RSM v. St. Lucia*, the right to be preserved need not necessarily exist at the time of the request.96 Therefore, while the Tribunal acknowledges that the right requiring preservation relies on two hypothetical events (that the Respondent will prevail in this arbitration and that it will be awarded costs), it nevertheless deems that the *prima facie* existence of a right has been established.\n\n*Victor Pey Casado and Foundation President Allende v. Republic of Chile*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/2, Decision on provisional measures requested by the Parties, 25 September 2001, \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48, 80 (Exh. RL-1); *RSM Production Corporation et al. v. Grenada*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Tribunal's Decision on Respondent's Application for Security for Costs, 14 October 2010, \u00b6 5.8 (Exh. RL-7); *RSM Production Corporation v.

RL-4).\n\n**(ii) Existence of exceptional circumstances**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Parties agree that the provisional remedy requested can only be granted in circumstances of exceptional nature. These circumstances should display a real risk that the Claimant will not comply with a potential order for costs because it is unable or unwilling to do so.\n\n77.\n\nThe Tribunal finds that, in the present state of the record, the circumstances are not exceptional and consequently denies the request for the following reasons.\n\n78.\n\nFirst, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimant's structure, that of a holding company, is neither unusual nor exceptional. Similarly, the alleged lack of transparency and the fact that BSGR may transfer its assets do not appear exceptional nor do they pose an extraordinary risk of defaulting on a potential order for costs. This is in particular so as the Claimant asserts that it has never defaulted on its financial obligations, an assertion that has not been persuasively contested by the Respondent.\n\n79.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal cannot foresee how the multiple legal proceedings against the Claimant will end and how they may impact the financial condition of BSGR. Further, the recapitalization or restructuring of some subsidiaries do not in and of themselves say much about the finances of the group and the holding company. Moreover, the Tribunal notes the Claimant's statement that its equity and assets are close to USD 700 million and liabilities just exceed USD 10 million.\n\n80.\n\nThird, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that Mr. Beny Steinmetz is not party to these proceedings and thus his personal finances \u2013 whatever they may be \u2013 appear irrelevant.\n\n81.\n\nIn view of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes that the requirement of necessity is not met. Since the requirements for provisional measures are cumulative, the Tribunal will dispense with examining whether the requirement of urgency is satisfied.\n\n**(iii) Conclusion**\n--------------------\n\n82.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not established being entitled to an order for security for costs.\n\n**c. Costs**\n------------\n\n83.\n\nEach Party requests the Tribunal to order the opposing Party to bear the costs associated with the Application. The Tribunal finds it preferable to rule on costs at a later stage and thus reserves its decision. The Tribunal therefore makes no direction for further details of those costs at this time.\n\n**3. Final observations**\n-------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThis order is issued in the present state of the record and can be reopened if circumstances change materially.\n\n85.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the issue of publication of certain exhibits and paragraph 60 of Claimant's Response shall be dealt with in a separate Procedural Order.\n\n**IV. ORDER**\n-------------\n\n86.\n\nOn this basis, the Arbitral Tribunal:\n\n(1) Partially grants the Respondent's request that the Claimant pay the advances of arbitration costs;\n\n(2) Determines that as from the second advance of costs, the Claimant shall bear 75% and the Respondent 25% of the requested advance, without prejudice to the final cost allocation;\n\n(3) Denies the Respondent's request that the Claimant post security for costs;\n\n(4) Reserves its decision on costs related to the Application for a later stage of these proceedings."}, {"Title": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify All Members of the Arbitral Tribunal", "Type": "Arbitrator & Judge Challenge", "Date": "2016-12-28T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on the Proposal to Disqualify All Members of the Arbitral Tribunal\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**I. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n-------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, BSG Resources Limited submitted a Request for Arbitration to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") against the Republic of Guinea (\"**Guinea**\" or \"**Respondent**\").\n\n2.\n\nOn 8 September 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"**ICSID Convention**\"), under ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22.\n\n3.\n\nOn 5 February 2015, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**ICSID Arbitration Rules**\"). Mr. Benjamin Garel, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal is composed of Ms. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, President, appointed by her co-arbitrators in accordance with the Parties' agreement regarding the method of constitution of the Tribunal under Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention; Mr. Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of the Netherlands, appointed by the Claimants; and Mr. Pierre Mayer, a national of France, appointed by the Respondent.\n\n5.\n\nOn 23 April 2015, the Tribunal held its first session with the Parties. During the first session, the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and that they had no objection to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal.\n\n6.\n\nOn 13 October 2015, BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited and BSG Resources (Guinea) S\u00c0RL submitted another Request for Arbitration to ICSID against Guinea. On 25 November 2015, the Secretary-General registered this Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, under ICSID Case No. ARB/15/46.\n\n7.\n\nOn 7 December 2015, the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/15/46 was constituted pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. It was composed of the same members as the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22.\n\n8.\n\nOn 14 February 2016, the Tribunals issued Procedural Order No. 1 in ICSID Case No. ARB/15/46 and Procedural Order No. 5 in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22 implementing, at the Parties' request, the consolidation of the two cases into ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22. On the same day, the Tribunal in ICSID Case No. ARB/15/46 issued Procedural Order No. 2 taking note of the discontinuance of ARB/15/46 in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(1).\n\n9.\n\nOn 9 August 2016, the Parties submitted their requests for document production to the Tribunal, in the form of Redfern Schedules.\n\n10.\n\nOn 5 September 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (\"PO7\") containing its decisions on the Parties' requests for document production.\n\n11.\n\nOn 3 October 2016, the Parties produced documents pursuant to PO7.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 15 October 2016, BSG Resources Limited, BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited and BSG Resources (Guinea) SARL (\"**Claimants**\") alleged that the Respondent was withholding certain relevant and material documents that the Tribunal had ordered it to produce in PO7. The Claimants asked the Tribunal to order the Respondent to produce these documents and to indicate the steps it had taken to identify and collect the documents ordered to be produced by PO7.\n\n13.\n\nBy letter dated 22 October 2016, the Respondent denied having withheld responsive documents and explained the steps taken to comply with the Tribunal's decision in PO7.\n\n14.\n\nBy emails dated 22 and 24 October 2016, the Claimants sought leave to respond to the Respondent's letter dated 22 October 2016. By email dated 24 October 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it did not wish to receive further communications from the Parties in relation to document production, and that it would revert shortly with further directions.\n\n15.\n\nBy letter dated 27 October 2016, the Tribunal conveyed the following message to the Parties:\n\n*Having reviewed the positions of the Parties, including the Respondent's responses to Annex 1, the Tribunal is of the view that pursuing these issues of document production at this stage of the proceedings will make no meaningful contribution to the resolution of this dispute. This said, it notes that, to the extent the Claimants wish to claim that non-compliance with Procedural Order No. 7 entails legal consequences, such as for instance adverse inferences, they may do so in the further course of the arbitration, specifically in their further scheduled written submissions and at the hearing. In addition, the Tribunal reminds the Parties that they are under a continuing duty to produce responsive documents as and when they become available. All other requests are denied.*\n\n16.\n\nOn 4 November 2016, the Claimants proposed the disqualification of all three members of the Tribunal in accordance with Article 57 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 9 (\"**Proposal**\"). On that date, the Centre informed the Parties that the proceeding had been suspended until the Proposal was decided, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6). The Centre also established a procedural calendar for the Parties' submissions on the Proposal.\n\n17.\n\nOn 11 November 2016, the Respondent submitted its response to the Proposal.\n\n18.\n\nBy letter dated 15 November 2016, the three members of the Tribunal jointly furnished explanations as envisaged by ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).\n\n19.\n\nBy email dated 22 November 2016 and by letter dated 23 November 2016, the Respondent and the Claimants, respectively, submitted further observations.\n\n**II. PARTIES' ARGUMENTS**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Proposal**\n------------------------------\n\n20.\n\nThe Claimants' arguments in support of their proposal to disqualify the members of the Tribunal were set forth in their submissions of 4 November 2016 and 23 November 2016. These arguments are summarized below.\n\n**1) The Basis for Disqualification of the Tribunal Members**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. The Tribunal's Alleged Prejudgment of a Central Issue in the Arbitration**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Tribunal prejudged a central issue in the arbitration, \"*which raises reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the members of the Tribunal and reveals an underlying bias against Claimants*.\"1\n\nProposal, \u00b6 38.\n\n22.\n\nThe Claimants' contention relates to the Tribunal's decision on 27 October 2016 regarding the Claimants' requests for document production (the \"**Decision**\"). During the document production phase, the Claimants had sought from the Respondent \"*the production of Emails and Deliberations in relation to the process and the reasoning for the award of the Mining Rights to Claimants*.\"2 According to the Claimants, these key documents related to the core issues in this case as they would assist in establishing whether the mining rights were procured by the Claimants in accordance with due process and based on arms-length negotiations.3\n\nProposal, \u00b6 35.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 35; see also Cl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 20-36.\n\n23.\n\nThe Claimants argue that in PO7 the Tribunal acknowledged that the Emails and Deliberations were relevant and material to the outcome of the case, yet it came to the opposite conclusion on 27 October 2016 when it found \"*that pursuing these issues of document production at this stage of the proceedings will make no meaningful contribution to the resolution of this dispute*\" and rejected the Claimants' request.4\n\nProposal, \u00b6 36.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimants consider that:\n\n*By concluding that the production of the Emails and Deliberations (that until a few weeks ago were considered relevant and material) will no longer meaningfully contribute to the resolution of the dispute, the Tribunal has undoubtedly prejudged the fiercely contested issues in this arbitration.*5\n\nProposal, \u00b6 37.\n\n25.\n\nThe Claimants maintain that the Tribunal's Decision on document production is flawed because it is based on Guinea's belated and incorrect argument that it lacked control over the requested documents and was unable to search for them.6 The Claimants further submit that there is reasonable doubt as to the Tribunal's impartiality because the Tribunal ignored Guinea's withholding of relevant and material documents without proper justification and because the Tribunal failed to review such documents.7 According to the Claimants, these concerns are amplified by the Tribunal's refusal to allow them to respond to Guinea's letter of 22 October 2016.8\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 38-39; see also Cl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 37-51.\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 40-41.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 42; see also Cl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 78-80.\n\n26.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Claimants conclude that:\n\n*A third person undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the Tribunal's extraordinary decision to allow Guinea to withhold possibly hundreds of Emails that are potentially relevant and material to the outcome of the case and the Tribunal's refusal to Claimants' request to reply to Guinea's defence, would conclude that the members of the Tribunal manifestly lack the impartiality required under the ICSID Convention.*9\n\nProposal, \u00b6 43.\n\n**b. The Tribunal's Alleged Denial of Due Process and Violation of the Claimants' Rights**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nIn the Claimants' view, the production of documents is an essential part of international arbitration, and it plays a key role in ascertaining the truth.10 The Claimants argue that the documents requested will be crucial to meet their burden of proof and to demonstrate that the mining rights at issue were obtained in a lawful manner.11 According to the Claimants, the Tribunal's refusal to order the production of such documents is a denial of due process, which violates the Claimants' rights to present their case and be treated fairly.12 The Claimants add that \"[t]*his denial of due process and violation of Claimants' most fundamental rights raises reasonable doubts as to the impartiality of the arbitrators and their underlying bias against Claimants.*\"13\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 44-47.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 47.\n\nProposal, \u00b6\u00b6 48-49.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 50.\n\n28.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the Tribunal's decision was not warranted by the procedural timetable of the case.14\n\nProposal, \u00b6 51.\n\n29.\n\nThe Claimants also argue that, contrary to the Tribunal's suggestion, the potential to request inferences adverse to the Respondent would not alleviate their concerns.15 The Claimants note that arbitral tribunals rarely draw adverse inferences and that adverse inferences are not an adequate substitute for the undisclosed evidence.16\n\nProposal, \u00b6 52; see also Cl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 111-114.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 52; Cl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6 112-113.\n\n30.\n\nFor the Claimants,\n\n*a third person undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the Tribunal's extraordinary decisions to deprive Claimants of hundreds [sic] Emails, Deliberations and other documents that will assist them to establish their innocence, undermine Guinea's case and evidence and impeach Guinea's witnesses in cross-examination, would conclude that the members of the Tribunal manifestly lack the impartiality required under the ICSID Convention*.17\n\nProposal, \u00b6 53; see also Cl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 94-105.\n\n**c. The Claimants' Further Observations on the Proposal**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n31.\n\nThe Claimants contend that factual developments occurring subsequent to the Tribunal's Decision reinforced the relevance of the documents not produced by the Respondent *.*18\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 85-88.\n\n32.\n\nThe Claimants also allege that the Tribunal had shown prior preferential treatment of Guinea in its decisions on prior applications made to the Tribunal in August and September 2016.19\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 89-93.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimants finally submit that their Proposal is made in good faith and was not intended to delay the proceedings.20\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 137-152.\n\n**d. The Claimants' Observations on the Respondent's Response**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\n*First,* the Claimants reject the Respondent's argument that the Tribunal has simply exercised its discretion to order additional document production. The Claimants state that they had not sought new or additional documents, but they had merely requested clarification of the Respondent's document production obligations.21\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 107-108.\n\n35.\n\n*Second,* the Claimants maintain that the Tribunal's reminder of the Parties' continuing production obligation, on which the Respondent relies, is meaningless because it is unclear how these contested documents will become available to the Respondent at a later stage.22\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 115-116.\n\n36.\n\n*Third,* the Claimants reject the Respondent's argument that the Tribunal has not prejudged the merits of the dispute by denying production of the contested documents because the scope of the Tribunal's ruling is limited in time by the words \"*at this stage.*\"23 For the Claimants,\n\n[ *i* ]*t is at this stage of the proceedings, during which Claimants could in normal circumstances incorporate the evidence obtained in the document production in its Reply Memorial and in its additional witness statement, that the requested documents could have contributed to the resolution of the dispute, not at a later stage when the Claimants have already filed their last memorial on the merits and last round of witness evidence*.24\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 117-125.\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6 120.\n\n37.\n\n*Fourth,* the Claimants consider that, contrary to the Respondent's assertions, the Tribunal's document production decisions dated 5 September 2016 and 27 October 2016 are inconsistent.25 For the Claimants, the decision in PO7 imposed an obligation on the Respondent to produce the requested documents, and the Decision of 27 October 2016 effectively revoked that obligation by refusing to reconfirm the order made in PO7.26\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 126-129.\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6 127.\n\n38.\n\n*Lastly,* the Claimants reject the Respondent's submission \"*that a tribunal's refusal to order production cannot constitute a violation of a party's right to due process and to the right to set out its case because otherwise a party would have an absolute right to document production*.\"27 For the Claimants, a party is treated unfairly and there is no due process if that party is denied the production of important documents or other evidence.28\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6 130.\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6 136.\n\n**2) The Applicable Legal Standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n39.\n\nThe Claimants submit that: (a) the requirement in Article 14 of the ICSID Convention that an arbitrator must be \"*a person who may be relied upon to exercise independent judgment*\" requires arbitrators to be both impartial and independent; (b) impartiality refers to the absence of bias or predisposition toward a party, and independence is marked by the absence of external control;29 (c) actual proof of bias or dependence is not required, and appearance is sufficient;30 (d) the applicable legal standard is an objective standard based on a reasonable evaluation of the evidence by a third party;31 and (e) the term \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention means \"obvious\" or \"evident\" and relates to the ease with which the lack of the required quality can be perceived.32\n\nProposal, \u00b6 29.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 30.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 31.\n\nProposal, \u00b6 32.\n\n40.\n\nThe Claimants further submit that \"*the legal standard that applies to the disqualification of arbitrators in ICSID proceedings* [...] *is whether a reasonable third party, with knowledge of all the facts, would consider that there were reasonable grounds for doubting that the arbitrator possessed the required qualities of impartiality and or independence*.\"33\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6 5.\n\n41.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that a third party observer would find that the Tribunal treated them unfairly and that:\n\n*[...] due process was violated, that Claimants have been deprived of the right to fully set out their case and defend Guinea's case and that they have been treated unfairly by the Tribunal. He would conclude that the facts manifestly evidence an appearance of a lack of impartiality and prejudgment with respect to Claimants. The disqualification proposal must therefore be upheld.*34\n\nCl. Fur. Obs., \u00b6\u00b6 104-105.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Reply**\n-----------------------------\n\n42.\n\nThe Respondent's arguments opposing the Claimants' Proposal to disqualify the members of the Tribunal were set forth in its submission of 11 November 2016.35 These arguments are summarized below.\n\nAs mentioned in \u00b6 18 above, the Respondent submitted further observations by email dated 22 November 2016, which read (translated from the French):  \n \"*The Republic of Guinea took note of the letter dated 15 November 2016 from Professor Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, Professor Albert Jan van den Berg and Professor Pierre Mayer, who confirm having acted in accordance with the fundamental principles of procedure, impartially and independently.*  \n*The statement from the Tribunal members confirms that the decision challenged by the BSGR companies occurred in the course of the normal conduct of an arbitration proceeding. This decision is therefore not susceptible of justifying their disqualification. Subject to this further observation, the Republic of Guinea continues to rely on its submission dated 11 November 2016*.\"\n\n**1) The Lack of Merits of the Proposal to Disqualify**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n43.\n\n*First,* the Respondent contends that the Tribunal respected the rules applicable to document production and fulfilled its duties in that respect.36 The Respondent adds that arbitral tribunals have discretion to order document production, which includes the power to draw adverse inferences.37 The Respondent also emphasizes that the Tribunal has reminded the parties of their continuing duty to produce responsive documents as and when they become available.38\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 37-45.\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 38-43.\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6 44.\n\n44.\n\n*Second,* the Respondent submits that the Tribunal has not prejudged the merits of the dispute.39 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal did not conclude that the production of the requested documents would not contribute to the resolution of the dispute.40 Rather, the Tribunal found supplementary production was unnecessary at this stage of the proceedings.41 The Respondent also argues that the documents requested by the Claimants would not support the Claimants' case, hence the Tribunal's decision could not prejudice the Claimants.42\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 46-59.\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6 48.\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6 48.\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 52-59.\n\n45.\n\n*Third,* the Respondent submits that the Tribunal's decisions of 5 September 2016 and 27 October 2016 are not inconsistent, since the first decision concerned the production of documents and the second decision related to additional measures sought by the Claimants in relation to document production.43\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6 62-64.\n\n46.\n\n*Fourth,* the Respondent argues that the Proposal is based on a misleading description of the Tribunal's decision of 27 October 2016. For the Respondent, the Tribunal did not decide, as the Claimants contend, that the requested documents \"*will no longer meaningfully contribute to the resolution of the dispute.*\"44 Rather, the Respondent submits, the Tribunal ruled that \"*pursuing these issues of document production at this stage of the proceedings will make no meaningful contribution to the resolution of this dispute*.\"45 The Respondent therefore contends that the Tribunal reserved the possibility of amending its decision later in the proceeding if the requested measures become relevant.46\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6 65.\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6 66, citing the Tribunal's decision of 27 October 2016.\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6 67.\n\n47.\n\n*Fifth,* the Respondent considers that the Tribunal respected the Claimants' due process rights.47 According to the Respondent, the Tribunal has discretion to decide on document production requests and therefore has not impaired the Claimants' ability to present their case by exercising such power.48 To the contrary, the Respondent submits that the potential to request the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences based on an allegedly defective document production protects the Claimants' due process rights.49\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 69-76.\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 70-73.\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 75-76.\n\n48.\n\n*Sixth,* the Respondent submits that the Tribunal has not breached the Claimants' right to equitable treatment by rejecting their requests for document production.50\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 77-80\n\n**2) The Applicable Legal Standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Article 57 of the ICSID Convention requires the challenging party to bear the burden of proving that the lack of impartiality is \"manifest.\"51 For the Respondent, this burden of proof is high as it is insufficient to establish an apparent lack of impartiality; the lack of impartiality must be established by objective evidence which would convince a reasonable observer and would not require an extensive analysis of the facts. The Respondent further submits that the decisions relied on by the Claimants affirm the high burden of proof on a disqualification.52\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6 26.\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 27-34.\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the facts relied on by the Claimants do not raise any objective doubts as to the impartiality of the arbitrators, and only reflect a party's disagreement with a procedural decision.53\n\nRespondent's Observations dated 11 November 2016, \u00b6 35.\n\n**C. Arbitrators' Explanations**\n--------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nBy letter dated 15 November 2016, arbitrators Kaufmann-Kohler, van den Berg and Mayer provided a joint statement, which reads:\n\n*Dear Secretary of the Tribunal,*\n\n*We refer to the Claimants' proposal of 4 November 2016 for the disqualification of all members of this Arbitral Tribunal and to the Respondent's response of 11 November 2016.*\n\n*We will not comment on the Parties' submissions. We confirm that we consider that we have conducted, and we further intend to conduct, these proceedings in compliance with fundamental principles of procedure, in particular with the principles of due process and impartiality and independence.*\n\n*Sincerely yours,*\n\n*Albert Jan van den Berg Pierre Mayer*\n\n*Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler*54\n\nTribunal's letter dated 15 November 2016.\n\n**III. DECISION BY THE CHAIRMAN**\n---------------------------------\n\n**A. The Applicable Legal Standard**\n------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nArticle 57 of the ICSID Convention allows a party to propose the disqualification of any member of a tribunal. It reads as follows:\n\n*A party may propose to a Commission or Tribunal the disqualification of any of its members on account of any fact indicating a manifest lack of the qualities required by paragraph (1) of Article 14. A party to arbitration proceedings may, in addition, propose the disqualification of an arbitrator on the ground that he was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.*\n\n53.\n\nThe disqualification proposed in this case alleges that all members of the Tribunal manifestly lack the qualities required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to address disqualification \"*on the ground that [an arbitrator] was ineligible for appointment to the Tribunal under Section 2 of Chapter IV.*\"\n\n54.\n\nA number of decisions have concluded that the word \"manifest\" in Article 57 of the ICSID Convention means \"evident\" or \"obvious,\"55 and that it relates to the ease with which the alleged lack of the required qualities can be perceived.56\n\nSee *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona SA. v.

Competence in the field of law shall be of particular importance in the case of persons on the Panel of Arbitrators.*\n\n56.\n\nWhile the English version of Article 14 of the ICSID Convention refers to \"*independent judgment*,\" and the French version to \"*toute garantie d'ind\u00e9pendance dans l'exercice de leurs fonctions,*\" the Spanish version requires \"*imparcialidad de juicio*\" (impartiality of judgment). Given that all three versions are equally authentic, it is accepted that arbitrators must be both impartial and independent.57\n\n*Suez,* \u00b6 28 *; OPIC Karimum Corporation v.

Independence is characterized by the absence of external control.58 Independence and impartiality both \"*protect parties against arbitrators being influenced by factors other than those related to the merits of the case*.\"59 Articles 57 and 14(1) of the ICSID Convention do not require proof of actual dependence or bias; rather it is sufficient to establish the appearance of dependence or bias.60\n\n*Suez*, \u00b6 29; *ConocoPhillips*, \u00b6 54; *Burlington,* \u00b6 66; *Abaclat,* \u00b6 75; *Conoco,* \u00b6 51; *Conoco et al.*, \u00b6 81.\n\n*ConocoPhillips*, \u00b6 55; *Universal*, \u00b6 70; *Urbaser S.A. and others v.

Timeliness**\n-----------------\n\n59.\n\nArbitration Rule 9(1) reads as follows:\n\n*A party proposing the disqualification of an arbitrator pursuant to Article 57 of the Convention shall promptly, and in any event before the proceeding is declared closed, file its proposal with the Secretary-General, stating its reasons therefor.*\n\n60.\n\nThe ICSID Convention and Rules do not specify a number of days within which a proposal for disqualification must be filed. Accordingly, the timeliness of a proposal must be determined on a case by case basis.63 Previous tribunals have found that a proposal was timely when filed within 10 days of learning the underlying facts,64 but untimely when filed after 53 days.65\n\n*Burlington*, \u00b6 73; *Conoco*, \u00b6 39; *Abaclat*, \u00b6 68; *Conoco et al.*, \u00b6 63.\n\n*Urbaser,* \u00b6 19.\n\n*Suez*, \u00b6\u00b6 22-26.\n\n61.\n\nThe Respondent has not contended that the Proposal was untimely.\n\n62.\n\nThe Proposal in this case was filed 7 days after the Tribunal's ruling which gave rise to the Proposal. Accordingly, the Proposal was filed promptly for the purposes of Arbitration Rule 9(1).\n\n**C. Merits**\n-------------\n\n63.\n\nAs recalled above, each Party had an opportunity to submit comments on the relevant document production issues, first in their Redfern Schedules submitted on 9 August 2016 and subsequently in their additional observations, i.e. the Claimants' letter of 15 October 2016 and the Respondent's response thereto of 22 October 2016.66\n\nSee \u00b6\u00b6 9-14.\n\n64.\n\nThe Tribunal then ruled on the Claimants' 15 October 2016 request, indicating that *\" pursuing these issues of document production at this stage of the proceedings [would] make no meaningful contribution to the resolution of the dispute*.\"67\n\nTribunal's Letter of 27 October 2016. Emphasis added.\n\n65.\n\nThe Tribunal also expressly indicated that the Claimants were free to discuss the Respondent's alleged non-compliance with PO7 and its legal consequences, such as adverse inferences, *\"in their further scheduled written submissions and at the hearing, \"68* thus offering further opportunities to the Claimants to address these evidentiary matters.\n\nTribunal's Letter of 27 October 2016. Emphasis added.\n\n66.\n\nThe Tribunal finally reminded the Parties of their \"*continuing duty to produce responsive documents as and when they become available*.\"69\n\nTribunal's Letter of 27 October 2016.\n\n67.\n\nTherefore, and upon careful review of the Parties' submissions, the Chairman sees no evidence of either prejudgment of the disputed issues or any violation of due process in the Tribunal's Decision.\n\n68.\n\nWhile the Claimants may not be satisfied with the Tribunal's Decision, the mere existence of an adverse ruling is insufficient to prove a manifest lack of impartiality, as required by Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention. If it were otherwise, proceedings could continuously be interrupted by a dissatisfied party, which would unduly disrupt and prolong the arbitral process.\n\n69.\n\nIn the Chairman's view, a third party undertaking a reasonable evaluation of the Tribunal's Decision and surrounding facts relied upon in the Claimants' Proposal, would not find a manifest lack of the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. Accordingly, the disqualification proposal must be rejected.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n70.\n\nHaving considered all the facts alleged and the arguments submitted by the Parties, and for the reasons stated above, the Chairman rejects the Claimants' Proposal to disqualify all members of the Tribunal."}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2022-05-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n**TABLE OF ABBREVIATIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| ABFDE | American Board of Forensic Document Examiners |\n| ASTM | American Society of Testing and Materials |\n| Base Convention | Basic Agreement between the Republic of Guinea and BSG Resources for the Exploitation of the Zogota/N\u2019Zerekore Iron Ore Deposits of 16 December 2009 |\n| BOT Act | Act L/97/012/AN of 1 June 1998 on the Financing, Construction, Exploitation, Maintenance and Transfer of Development Infrastructures by the Private Sector |\n| BSG | Beny Steinmetz Group |\n| BSGR | BSG Resources Limited (in Administration since 6 March 2018) |\n| BSGR Guernsey | BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited |\n| BSGR Guinea | BSG Resources (Guinea) S\u00e0rl |\n| BSGR Guinea BVI | BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited |\n| BVI | British Virgin Islands |\n| C-CFER | Claimants\u2019 Comments of 12 March 2018 on the Final Expert Report |\n| C-CPER | Claimants\u2019 Comments of 24 January 2018 on the Preliminary Expert Report |\n| CEO | Chief Executive Officer |\n| Claimants | BSG Resources Limited (in Administration since 6 March 2018), BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited and BSG Resources (Guinea) S\u00e0rl |\n| CM | Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial of 17 June 2016 |\n| CPDM | *Centre de Promotion et de D\u00e9veloppement Minier* (Agency for the Promotion and Development of Mining) |\n| C-PHB1 | Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief of 11 June 2018 |\n| C-PHB2 | Claimants\u2019 Reply Post-Hearing Brief of 9 July 2018 |\n| C-RFA | Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration of 1 August 2014 |\n| CVRD | *Companhia Vale do Rio Doce* (renamed Vale in 2007) |\n| DA | Document Authenticity |\n| DOJ | Department of Justice |\n| ECOWAS | Economic Community of West African States |\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| EDD | Electrostatic Detection Device |\n| ER1 | First Expert Report |\n| ER2 | Second Expert Report |\n| ESDA | Electrostatic Detection Apparatus |\n| Exh.

The Respondent**\n---------------------\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Guinea (\"Guinea\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n8.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Michael Ostrove, Theobald Naud and Cl\u00e9mentine Emery of DLA Piper France LLP, Scott Horton of DLA Piper UK LLP, and Pascal Agboyibor of Asafo & Co.\n\n**B. The Tribunal**\n-------------------\n\n9.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal is composed of:\n\n\u2022 Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, President  \n\u2022 Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg, a national of the Netherlands, Arbitrator  \n\u2022 Prof. Pierre Mayer, a national of France, Arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nThe Centre appointed Mr. Benjamin Garel as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n11.\n\nWith the consent of the Parties, the Tribunal appointed Dr. Magnus Jesko Langer, a lawyer of the President\u2019s law firm, as Assistant to the Tribunal. His curriculum vitae and a declaration of impartiality and independence were circulated to the Parties.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Initial phase**\n--------------------\n\n12.\n\nOn 1 August 2014, the Centre received an electronic copy of the Request for Arbitration (the \"ROA\") submitted by BSGR (or the \"Claimant 1\") against the Republic of Guinea. On 11 August 2014, the Centre received the original of the ROA together with 27 exhibits (Exh. C-1 to Exh. C-27).\n\n13.\n\nOn 13 August 2014, the Centre acknowledged receipt of BSGR\u2019s payment of the filing fee and transmitted a copy of the Request to the Republic of Guinea in pursuance of ICSID Institution Rule 5(2).\n\n14.\n\nThe Secretary-General of ICSID registered this arbitration on 8 September 2014 pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention as *BSG Resources Limited v. Republic of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22.\n\n15.\n\nOn 5 February 2015, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules.\n\n16.\n\nOn 26 February 2015, the Secretary of the Tribunal circulated a draft agenda of the first session, as well as a draft procedural order. The Parties submitted their comments on both documents on 20 April 2015.\n\n17.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held in person on 23 April 2015 in Geneva, Switzerland. In addition to discussing the content of the draft procedural order, it was agreed that this arbitration would not be confidential and that the Parties would state their views on the application of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency by 27 May 2015. The discussion also included the Respondent\u2019s announced request for provisional measures.\n\n18.\n\nOn 13 May 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (\"PO1\"), setting out the procedural rules governing this arbitration and including the calendar for the jurisdictional and liability phase in Annex A.\n\n19.\n\nOn 17 September 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (\"PO2\"), which provides the transparency regime of this arbitration. The Tribunal also issued a consolidated text of the UNCITRAL Rules on Transparency as amended by PO2 on 22 October 2015.\n\n20.\n\nOn 25 November 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (\"PO3\"), partially granting the Respondent\u2019s request that the Claimant pay the advances of arbitration costs and denying the Respondent\u2019s request that the Claimant post security for costs.\n\n21.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (\"PO4\") in relation to the Respondent\u2019s objections to transparency.\n\n**B. Consolidation**\n--------------------\n\n22.\n\nOn 13 October 2015, BSGR Guernsey (the \"Claimant 2\") and BSGR Guinea (the \"Claimant 3\") filed a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Guinea. In that request, they informed the Centre that they would make an application for the consolidation with ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22.\n\n23.\n\nThe arbitration brought by the Claimants 2 and 3 was registered on 25 November 2015 pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention as *BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited and BSG Resources (Guinea) SARL v. Republic of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. 15/46. The Tribunal was constituted on 7 December 2015, pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention. It was composed of the same members as the Tribunal in the arbitration brought by the Claimant 1, i.e. ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22.\n\n24.\n\nOn 5 February 2016, a common session was held by telephone conference serving as the first session in ICSID Case No. ARB/15/46 and providing an opportunity to address the consolidation of the two arbitrations (ICSID Cases Nos. ARB/14/22 and ARB/15/46), on the basis of an agenda and draft procedural order circulated by the Secretary of the Tribunal on 26 January 2016.\n\n25.\n\nHaving secured the agreement of BSGR, BSGR Guernsey, BSGR Guinea, and the Republic of Guinea that the disputes be adjudicated by the same Tribunal in one consolidated ICSID proceeding, on 14 February 2016 the Tribunal issued a procedural order which served as Procedural Order No. 1 in ICSID Case No. ARB/15/46 and constituted Procedural Order No. 5 (\"PO5\") in ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22 concerning the consolidation of the two arbitrations into ICSID Case No. ARB/14/22. On the same day, the Tribunal in ARB/15/46 issued Procedural Order No. 2 taking note of the discontinuance of ARB/15/46 in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(1). The consolidated case was registered as *BSG Resources Limited, BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited and BSG Resources (Guinea) SARL v. Republic of Guinea,* ICSID Case No. 14/22.\n\n**C. Start of pre-hearing phase**\n---------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants filed their amended Memorial (the \"Memorial\") on 29 February 2016. The Memorial was accompanied by 160 factual exhibits (Exh. C-1 to Exh. C-160) and 30 legal authorities (Exh. CL-1 to Exh. CL-30). The Claimants further attached witness statements of Messrs. Benjamin Steinmetz, Marc Struik, Asher Avidan, Joseph Tchelet, Mahmoud Thiam, Patrick Saada and Dag Cramer.\n\n27.\n\nOn 11 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 (\"PO6\") addressing the Respondent\u2019s transparency objections in respect of the Memorial.\n\n28.\n\nIn conformity with the amended procedural schedule, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial (the \"Counter-Memorial\") on 17 June 2016. In the Counter-Memorial, the Respondent raised various jurisdictional objections. In addition to requesting that the Tribunal dismiss the claims and award it costs, the Respondent also raised counterclaims. The Counter-Memorial was accompanied by 413 factual exhibits (Exh. R-71 to Exh. R-483), 58 legal authorities (Exh. RL-18 to Exh. RL-75). The Respondent further attached the witness statements of Messrs. Ousmane Sylla, Ahmed Tidiane Souare, Lansana Tinkiano, Ahmed Kant\u00e9, and Lounceny Nab\u00e9. On 4 October 2016, the Tribunal resolved the Parties\u2019 transparency objections in respect of the Counter-Memorial.\n\n29.\n\nFollowing the exchange of their requests for production of documents on 8 July 2016, the filing of their objections on 9 August 2016, and the re-submission of new and amended requests by the Claimants on 22 August 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 (\"PO7\") resolving the outstanding document production requests on 5 September 2016.\n\n**D.

In accordance with PO2, the Hearing was also broadcast and made publicly accessible by video link on the ICSID website.\n\n45.\n\nAfter having heard the Parties, the Tribunal advised them at the end of the Hearing that it intended to appoint an expert to conduct a forensic inspection of the originals of certain documents that had been impugned by the Claimants in the course of the Hearing (the \"Disputed Documents\").\n\n46.\n\nAt the end of the Hearing, the Tribunal and the Parties held a procedural discussion in relation to post-hearing matters according to paragraph 38 of PO9.\n\n**G. Designation of Tribunal-appointed forensic experts**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nOn 7 June 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11 (\"PO11\") relating to the post-hearing matters discussed at the end of the Hearing and setting out the first procedural steps to put in place the inspection of the Disputed Documents (the \"Document Inspection\"). In particular, the Tribunal would identify an independent forensic expert, prepare his or her draft terms of reference and seek the Parties\u2019 comments, and determine the procedure for the Document Inspection.\n\n48.\n\nOn 13 July 2017, the Tribunal granted the Parties\u2019 joint request for an extension of time until 26 July 2017 for the filing of the corrections and redactions to the Hearing transcripts.\n\n49.\n\nOn 14 July 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 in relation to the Documents Inspection.\n\n50.\n\nOn 20 July 2017 in accordance with paragraph 16 of PO11, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to appoint Messrs. Todd Welch and Gerald LaPorte as independent forensic experts to inspect the Disputed Documents. The Tribunal explained that, after reviewing the profile and experience of a number of candidates, it had selected Messrs. Welch and LaPorte because of (i) the breadth of their combined expertise and experience, including in proceedings run by law enforcement agencies, (ii) their ability to perform a wide array of forensic examinations, from handwriting and signature inspection to ink and chemical paper analysis, (iii) the convenience of having experts working together in the same firm, (iv) the recognition they enjoyed from their peers and relevant professional organizations, (v) their availability, and (vi) independence from the Parties and their counsel. The Tribunal invited the Parties to submit any comments by 28 July 2017 and stated that, absent any objections, it would proceed with the formal appointment.\n\n51.\n\nOn 27 July 2017, following another extension, the Parties filed the corrections and proposed redactions to the Hearing transcripts.\n\n52.\n\nOn 31 July 2017, the Tribunal took note that the Parties had submitted no comments regarding the proposed appointments of Messrs. Welch and LaPorte and circulated draft terms of reference (the \"ToR\") to the Parties.\n\n53.\n\nOn 1 August 2017, the Tribunal informed Messrs. Welch and LaPorte that it wished to appoint them as experts (the \"Experts\" or \"Tribunal-appointed Experts\") to assess the authenticity of the Disputed Documents. Messrs. Welch and LaPorte accepted their appointment on the same day.\n\n54.\n\nOn 10 August 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13 dealing with the Parties\u2019 objections to the publication of the Hearing transcripts.\n\n55.\n\nOn 21 August 2017, the Tribunal had a telephone conference with the Experts as part of the process of preparing the terms of reference.\n\n56.\n\nOn 28 August 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14 (\"PO14)) dealing with the Document Inspection and attaching the Experts\u2019 draft ToR.\n\n57.\n\nOn 5 September 2017, the Parties provided their comments on the draft ToR.\n\n58.\n\nOn 9 September 2017, the Tribunal forwarded the Parties\u2019 comments on the draft ToR to the Experts. On the basis of these comments, it submitted a series of questions to the Experts in anticipation of a telephone conference with the Parties.\n\n59.\n\nOn 12 September 2017, the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties the answers it had received from the Experts to such questions.\n\n60.\n\nOn the same day, pursuant to paragraph 16 of Po14, the Respondent contacted the authorities of the United States of America (the \"US\") to seek their approval for the conduct of the Document Inspection on the premises of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBI\") in accordance with the conditions specified in paragraph 5 of PO14.\n\n61.\n\nOn 13 September 2017, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties and the Experts. The following persons participated in the telephone conference: Mr. Karel Daele, Mr. James Libson, Ms. Katy Colton, Ms. Deepa Somasunderam and Ms. Gabrielle Peled (for the Claimants); Mr. Michael Ostrove, Mr. Laurent Jaeger, Mr. Yann Schneller, Ms. S\u00e2rra-Tilila Bounfour and Ms. Andrea Lapunzina Veronelli (for the Respondent).\n\n62.\n\nOn 18 September 2017, the Parties commented on the answers provided by the Experts in writing and orally during the telephone conference. They also filed the information requested pursuant to paragraphs 16 and 17 of PO14.\n\n63.\n\nOn 21 September 2017, the US Department of Justice (\"US DOJ\") confirmed that the FBI had the Disputed Documents in its possession and would make them available for the Document Inspection at the FBI\u2019s offices in New York City.\n\n64.\n\nOn 22 September 2017, the Tribunal confirmed that party-appointed experts could attend the Document Inspection and assist the Parties in commenting on the report of the Experts.\n\n65.\n\nOn 27 September 2017, the Tribunal circulated a revised version of the draft ToR to the Parties and asked whether they would be available for the Document Inspection between 31 October and 3 November 2017.\n\n66.\n\nOn 30 September 2017, the Tribunal confirmed that the Document Inspection would be held between 31 October and 3 November 2017.\n\n67.\n\nOn 5 October 2017, the US DOJ informed the Tribunal that conducting the Document Inspection at the FBI offices in New York would not be feasible in light of the heavy equipment needed for the inspection. The US DOJ therefore suggested that the inspection take place at the New York office of one of the counsel, an FBI agent bringing the documents to the inspection location every morning and being present at all times during the inspection.\n\n68.\n\nOn 6 October 2017, the Respondent advised the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed for the inspection to be conducted at the New York office of DLA Piper.\n\n69.\n\nOn 9 October 2017, the Parties submitted the list of attendees to the Document Inspection.\n\n70.\n\nOn 11 October 2017, the Tribunal sent the ToR to the Experts for signature. The Experts did not sign this version because it was still open whether the Document Inspection would be videotaped.\n\n71.\n\nOn 13 October 2017 and pursuant to paragraph 9(c) of the revised draft ToR, the Claimants wrote that they had located additional comparator documents and would make them available if they were held securely and confidentially, were not shared with anyone except the Experts, and were returned to the Claimants at the conclusion of the Document Inspection. The Respondent objected to the Claimants\u2019 proposal on the ground that its counsel and experts needed access to these documents to assess the conclusions of the Experts.\n\n72.\n\nOn 17 October 2017, the Tribunal ordered the Claimants to submit (i) unredacted versions of the additional comparator documents to the Centre, which would hand them over to the Experts for the Document Inspection, and (ii) redacted versions to the Respondent and the Tribunal. The Tribunal reserved the possibility for the Respondent to request that a confidentiality advisor review the documents, and confirmed that the documents would be returned to the Claimants upon completion of the Documents Inspection.\n\n73.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal advised the Parties of the date, location and schedule of the Document Inspection.\n\n74.\n\nOn 20 October 2017, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal vary its decision in PO3 regarding the allocation of cost advances and restore the allocation to 50% each.\n\n75.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, following the FBI\u2019s formal consent to the inspection being videotaped, the Tribunal sent the ToR in their final form to the Experts, who signed them on the same day.\n\n76.\n\nOn 26 October 2017, the Tribunal forwarded the ToR signed by the Tribunal and the Experts, as well as a protocol dealing with practicalities of the Document Inspection (the \"Inspection Protocol\"). For the sake of transparency, the Tribunal further informed the Parties, that Dr. Valery Aginsky, one of the party-experts retained by the Respondent, was one of the candidates initially approached by the Tribunal.\n\n77.\n\nOn 27 October 2017, the Respondent advised the Claimant and the Tribunal that it had dispatched 11 additional comparator documents which it had recently discovered in the archives of the Republic of Guinea.\n\n78.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondent answered to the Claimants\u2019 request of 20 October 2017 to vary the decision in PO3 regarding the allocation of cost advances.\n\n**H. Document inspection and Experts\u2019 Report**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nOn 30 October 2017, the Experts set up the inspection room.\n\n80.\n\nThe Document Inspection was held from 31 October to 3 November 2017 at the DLA Piper office in New York.\n\n81.\n\nIn addition to the Experts and the Secretary of the Tribunal, the following persons attended the Document Inspection: Mr. James Libson, Mr. Karel Daele, Ms. Katy Colton, and experts Mr. Dennis Ryan and Ms. Laura Mancebo (for the Claimants); Mr. Scott Horton and experts Mr. Richard Picciochi and Mr. Valery Aginsky (for the Respondent).\n\n82.\n\nIn the morning of each day of the Document Inspection, an FBI Special Agent brought the originals of the Disputed Documents to the inspection room and retrieved them at the end of the each day.\n\n83.\n\nIn accordance with the Inspection Protocol, PO14, and the ToR, the morning inspection session ran from 9:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. followed by a morning Q&A session, and the afternoon session ran from 12:45 p.m. until 4:45 p.m., followed by an afternoon Q&A session. During the Q&A sessions, the Parties could ask the Experts to summarize the tasks performed during the session just concluded, and the Experts identified the exhibits they had been examining.\n\n84.\n\nThe Document Inspection was video recorded and the recordings made accessible to the Parties and the Tribunal.\n\n85.\n\nOn 31 October 2017, following a discussion between the Secretary and the counsel in attendance at the Document Inspection, the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties high resolution scanned copied of three additional documents (labelled DOC A, DOC B and DOC C by the Experts) that were among the documents handed over by the FBI to the Experts. As will be seen below, it is common ground that the content of DOC A is identical to page 1 of Exh. R-32, DOC B to page 2 of Exh. R-32 and DOC C to Exh. R-33.\n\n86.\n\nOn 1 November 2017, further to a discussion held between the Secretary and counsel on 31 October 2017 regarding exhibits Exh. R-30 and Exh. R-346, which were not part of the documents in the FBI\u2019s possession, the Tribunal specified that, due to limited time available to inspect the originals in the FBI\u2019s possession, the Experts would examine exhibits Exh. R-30 and Exh. R-346 in their laboratories after the inspection. The Tribunal further invited the Respondent to file, if possible, a copy created from the original documents of exhibits Exh. R-30 and Exh. R-346, as opposed to one created from copies.\n\n87.\n\nOn 3 November 2017, the Respondent reverted to the Tribunal replying that it was unable to locate originals of exhibits Exh. R-30 and Exh. R-346 and did not possess \"original copies\" of these documents either. On the same day, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal that they could not provide the original or a better copy of exhibit Exh. R-346.\n\n88.\n\nOn that day, i.e. on the last day of the inspection, and because counsel for the Claimants had to leave the inspection room by 4:00 p.m., it was agreed that a Q&A session would be held at 3:30 p.m., without prejudice to the Q&A session at the end of the day. The Claimants\u2019 experts left the inspection room shortly after Claimants\u2019 counsel. No Q&A session was held at the end of the afternoon inspection session, as the Respondent\u2019s counsel and experts in attendance had no questions for the Experts.\n\n89.\n\nOn 7 November 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 regarding the Claimants\u2019 request for reconsideration of PO3.\n\n90.\n\nOn 12 November 2017, the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties the Summary Minutes of the Document Inspection. Neither upon receipt of minutes nor during the course of the Document Inspection were there any objections raised about the conduct of the inspection.\n\n91.\n\nOn 5 December 2017, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal order the Respondent to provide more information regarding DOC A, DOC B and DOC C (referred to above in paragraph 85).\n\n92.\n\nOn 11 December 2017, the Respondent commented on the Claimants\u2019 letter of 5 December 2017.\n\n93.\n\nOn 12 December 2017, the Experts sent the first version of their preliminary report to the Tribunal.\n\n94.\n\nOn 21 December 2017, in accordance with Section VII of the ToR, the Tribunal informed the Experts that it had reviewed the first version of the preliminary report and requested certain clarifications, which the Experts gave on 22 and 23 December 2017.\n\n95.\n\nOn 21 December 2017, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that it had become aware of the existence of new documents relating to Mamadie Tour\u00e9 and thus sought the Tribunal\u2019s permission to add excerpts of these documents to the record.\n\n96.\n\nOn 29 December 2017, the Tribunal requested that the Experts add the raw data (ESDA lifts, VSC examinations, TLC plates, etc.) to their report.\n\n97.\n\nOn 1 January 2018, the Experts forwarded to the Tribunal their preliminary report (the \"Preliminary Report\"), including annexes and data, which the Tribunal passed on to the Parties on 3 January 2018. The Preliminary Report was also uploaded to the Box folder of the arbitration, in accordance with paragraphs 17 to 19 of PO14 and Annex 2 to the ToR. Specifically, the following files and documents were uploaded to the Box folder:\n\n\u2022 A high-quality PDF with the Preliminary Report and its Annexes 1 through 83 and A through J;\n\n\u2022 A folder labelled \"DATA\" containing all data collected and generated during the inspection and examinations, organized as follows:\n\no (1) Digital Images of Evidence as Received;\n\no (2) Digital Images of Evidence Following Sampling;\n\no (3) DOC A;\n\no (4) DOC B;\n\no (5) DOC C;\n\no (6) Exh. R-24;\n\no (7) Exh. R-25;\n\no (8) Exh. R-26;\n\no (9) Exh. R-27;\n\no (10) Exh. R-28;\n\no (11) Exh. R-29;\n\no (12) Exh. R-31;\n\no (13) Exh. R-32;\n\no (14) Exh. R-269; and\n\no (15) Testing Results.\n\n\u2022 For each Disputed Document a parent folder comprising the following three sub-folders:\n\no [Disputed Document ID] ESDA Lifts;\n\no [Disputed Document ID] High Resolution Scans; and\n\no [Disputed Document ID] Microscopic Images.\n\n\u2022 A parent folder for \"Testing Results\" comprising the following three sub-folders:\n\no Testing Results - GCMS;\n\no Testing Results - TLC (with additional sub-folders for the results from eight different TLC examinations); and\n\no Testing Results - VSC.\n\n98.\n\nOn 4 January 2018, the Respondent provided its comments objecting to the Claimants\u2019 request of 21 December 2018 to add new documents to the record.\n\n99.\n\nOn 10 January 2018, the Claimants requested an extension of the time limit to provide comments on the Preliminary Report until 25 January 2018.\n\n100.\n\nOn 11 January 2018, the Claimants requested leave to comment on the Respondent\u2019s comments of 4 January 2018, which they did on 15 January 2018.\n\n101.\n\nOn 12 January 2018, the Tribunal extended the deadline until 23 January 2018 for the Parties\u2019 comments on the Preliminary Report.\n\n102.\n\nOn 15 January 2018, the Claimants provided additional comments on their request of 21 December 2018 to add new documents to the record.\n\n103.\n\nOn 18 January 2018, the Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 additional comments of 15 January 2018.\n\n104.\n\nOn 23 January 2018, the Parties submitted their comments on the Preliminary Report, which the Tribunal transferred to the Experts on the following day.\n\n105.\n\nOn 12 February 2018, the Experts submitted their final report (the \"Report\" or \"Final Report\")), which the Tribunal sent to the Parties on 14 February 2018.\n\n106.\n\nOn 15 February 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16 in respect of the Claimants\u2019 request to file additional evidence.\n\n107.\n\nOn 21 February 2018, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal provide directions for the post-hearing briefs.\n\n108.\n\nOn 22 February 2018, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal delay the publication of the FER until further notice, and announced their intention to seek the disqualification of the Experts and a declaration that the FER was inadmissible on the ground of the Experts\u2019 lack of impartiality and expressed bias against the Claimants.\n\n109.\n\nOn 26 February 2018, the Respondent commented on the Claimants\u2019 applications of 22 February 2018.\n\n110.\n\nOn 27 February 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the editing of the video recordings of the Hearing held in May 2017 had been completed and invited the Parties to comment thereon by 20 March 2018. The video recordings, in English and French, had been uploaded to a subfolder within the Box folder.\n\n111.\n\nOn 28 February 2018, the Claimants provided additional comments to their request of 22 February 2018. In particular, they asked that their applications to disqualify the Experts and declare the FER inadmissible be determined as a preliminary matter.\n\n112.\n\nOn 1 March 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, in light of the Claimants\u2019 applications and the Parties\u2019 positions, and with reference to paragraph 24 of the ToR, it had decided that the hearing tentatively scheduled for 26 and 27 March 2018 would need to take place (the \"Authenticity Hearing\"). The purpose of the hearing would be to address the Claimants\u2019 applications and, in accordance with paragraph 24 of the ToR, the authenticity of the Disputed Documents. It would also be to examine the Experts and, possibly, any Party-appointed expert. The Tribunal further instructed the Claimants to file their applications by 12 March 2018, together with their comments on the FER, and the Respondent to file a response by 22 March 2018.\n\n113.\n\nOn 7 March 2018, the Claimants wrote to the Tribunal that, on the preceding day, the Royal Court of Guernsey had issued an Administration Order in respect of BSG Resources Limited, on which the Respondent commented on 8 March 2018.\n\n114.\n\nOn 12 March 2018, the Centre sent to the Parties information on the logistical arrangements for the Authenticity Hearing.\n\n115.\n\nOn the same day, the Parties filed their comments on the FER.

Copies of the sound recordings and the transcripts were delivered to the Parties.\n\n122.\n\nIn accordance with PO2, the Hearing was also broadcast and made publicly accessible by video link on the ICSID website. The audio-video recordings were delivered to the Parties.\n\n**J. Post-hearing phase**\n-------------------------\n\n123.\n\nOn 4 April 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 18 (\"PO18\") relating to post-hearing matters. On the same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it had decided to deny the Disqualification/Inadmissibility Applications and would provide reasons for this decision in due course.\n\n124.\n\nThe Parties simultaneously filed their Post-Hearing Briefs (\"PHBs\") on 12 June 2018.\n\n125.\n\nOn 9 July 2018, the Parties simultaneously filed Reply Post-Hearing Briefs (\"PHB2s\").\n\n126.\n\nOn 15 August 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 19 (\"PO19\") addressing the Claimants\u2019 transparency objections in respect of the Parties\u2019 Post-Hearing Briefs.\n\n127.\n\nOn 10 September 2018, the Tribunal requested the Parties to pay a further advance on costs in an amount of USD 400,000.\n\n128.\n\nPursuant to PO18, the Parties simultaneously filed their statements of costs on 14 September. The Claimants filed a reply statement of costs on 21 September 2018. The Respondent did not file a reply statement. However, on 27 September 2018, the Respondent requested leave to comment on the Claimants\u2019 reply statement of cost, which the Tribunal granted on 3 October 2018. On 8 October 2018, the Respondent filed a brief response to the Claimants\u2019 comments of 21 September 2018, and the Claimants filed a brief rejoinder on 15 October 2018.\n\n129.\n\nOn 8 November 2018, the Centre acknowledged receipt of the Claimants\u2019 payment of their share of the advance on costs, i.e. USD 200,000.\n\n130.\n\nOn 31 January 2019, the Centre notified the Parties of the Respondent\u2019s default regarding its share of the advance on costs, and invited either Party to pay the outstanding amount within 15 days.\n\n131.\n\nOn 7 March 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on reports published in the press of a settlement agreement concluded between the Parties and on the impact that such a settlement agreement, if confirmed, would have on the proceeding. The Tribunal further informed the Parties that pending receipt of the Parties\u2019 comments, it had suspended its work on the Award. The Tribunal also invited the Parties to indicate whether they intended to proceed with the payment of the outstanding amount under the pending request for advances on costs.\n\n132.\n\nOn 14 March 2019, the Claimants confirmed that the Parties entered into an in-principle agreement and were \"working towards a fully comprehensive agreement which will take a little time\". The Claimants further requested the Tribunal to pause its work on the Award and stay the proceeding unless either Party requested otherwise.\n\n133.\n\nOn 16 April 2019, the Claimants reiterated their request for a stay of the proceeding.\n\n134.\n\nOn 18 April 2019, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to confirm its consent to a stay of the proceeding.\n\n135.\n\nOn 20 April 2019, the Respondent confirmed its consent to a stay of the proceeding.\n\n136.\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the Centre reminded the Parties that a payment of USD 200,000 was still outstanding and invited \"either Party to make this payment, either in full or, for the time being, in an amount sufficient, taking into account the funds currently in the case\u2019s account, to allow the Centre to process the outstanding arbitrators\u2019 fee claims as well as their fees incurred in relation to the request for a stay of the proceedings, and the Centre\u2019s expenses, i.e. USD 25,000\".\n\n137.\n\nOn 30 April 2019, the Claimants confirmed having made a payment of USD 25,000, receipt of which the Centre acknowledged on 15 May 2019.\n\n138.\n\nOn the same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 20 (\"PO20\") (i) staying the proceeding, (ii) stating that the stay may be lifted at any time upon motion from either Party or, if necessary, *ex officio,* and (iii) ordering the Parties to inform the Tribunal about the progress of the settlement discussions on 31 May 2019.\n\n139.\n\nOn 31 May 2019, the Parties jointly requested an extension of time to inform the Tribunal about the progress of the settlement discussions, until 7 June 2019, which the Tribunal granted on the same day.\n\n140.\n\nOn 7 June 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were continuing to work towards a binding agreement and proposed to update the Tribunal further in July 2019, which the Tribunal acknowledged on the same day.\n\n141.\n\nOn 13 September 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal that there was still a significant amount of work to be done before a settlement agreement can be concluded and requested the Tribunal to continue the stay of the proceeding. The Parties proposed to update the Tribunal further by early November 2019, which the Tribunal acknowledged on the same day.\n\n142.\n\nOn 8 December 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties provide an update regarding to the status of their settlement negotiations and the status of the proceedings.\n\n143.\n\nOn 17 January 2020, the Parties requested an extension of the stay and proposed to further update the Tribunal in February 2020.\n\n144.\n\nOn 18 January 2020, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the requested extension of the stay was granted.\n\n145.\n\nOn 16 July 2020, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide an update regarding the status of their settlement negotiations and the status of the proceedings.\n\n146.\n\nOn 7 September 2020, the Tribunal reiterated its invitation to the Parties to provide an update regarding the status of their settlement negotiations and the status of the proceedings. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that its Award could be finalized provided that the outstanding amount of the advances on costs requested on 10 September 2018 (as reduced by the payment made by the Claimants on 30 April 2019) was paid by either Party.\n\n147.\n\nOn 30 September 2020, the Claimants informed the Tribunal that the administrators appointed on 6 March 2018 had been replaced by new administrators appointed on 8 September 2020, and that the new administrators were not in a position to take any position on either a settlement agreement, a lift of the stay or allowing the Tribunal to proceed to finalize its Award. The Claimants requested leave to provide a more substantial update in 60 days.\n\n148.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that no progress had been made between the Parties towards a formal settlement and that the administrators of BSG Resources Limited had indicated that they were not willing to approve a settlement in the terms previously discussed between the Parties. The Respondent also took note of the appointment of new administrators.\n\n149.\n\nOn 8 October 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 21 (\"PO21\") (i) ordering the Parties to provide a substantive update on their settlement discussions by 7 December 2020, (ii) extending the stay of the proceeding until 7 December 2020 and (iii) recalling that it may lift the stay of the proceedings at any time upon either a motion from either Party or, if necessary, *ex officio.*\n\n150.\n\nOn 7 December 2020, the Claimants requested a 60-day extension of the stay of the proceeding.\n\n151.\n\nOn the same day, the Respondent provided a substantial update on and account of the settlement discussions between the Parties and indicated that no substantial discussions has taken place between the Parties regarding the terms and conditions envisaged in their in-principle agreement and the signature of a final settlement agreement.\n\n152.\n\nOn 9 December 2020, the Tribunal invited either Party, whichever is more diligent, to indicate within 60 days whether the proceeding should resume or should be discontinued.\n\n153.\n\nOn 5 February 2021, the administrators of BSG Resources Limited indicated that they were \"now in the process of exploring in detail the prospect of reaching a settlement with Guinea\" and requested a 35-day extension of the stay of the proceeding.\n\n154.\n\nOn 8 February 2021, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, subject to any compelling objections that the Respondent may raise by 10 February 2021, the extension of the stay of the proceeding was granted.\n\n155.\n\nOn 10 February 2021, the Respondent indicated that the latest proposal by the administrators of BSGR, two years after the in-principle agreement was concluded between the Parties, was not serious and could not even be considered by the Republic of Guinea, and therefore expressed its doubts regarding the usefulness of another 35-day extension of the stay.\n\n156.\n\nOn 11 February 2021, the administrators of BSG Resources Limited submitted that they did not consider that the Respondent raised compelling reasons not to grant the 35-day extension of the stay.\n\n157.\n\nOn 15 February 2021, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to indicate by 19 February 2021, whether it considered that there was no prospect for a settlement anymore or whether it was open to a last attempt towards an amicable resolution of this dispute.\n\n158.\n\nOn 19 February 2021, the Respondent indicated that since the administrators of BSG Resources Limited clearly indicated that they cannot approve the terms of the in-principle agreement signed in 2019, there was no longer an agreement between the Parties and, therefore it had difficulty believing that a new settlement agreement could be reached within 35 days. The Respondent nevertheless left it to the Tribunal to decide whether a last extension of the stay should be granted or not.\n\n159.\n\nOn 22 February 2021, the Tribunal indicated that in the absence of any compelling reasons raised by the Respondent, the extension of stay had been granted on 8 February 2019 and, absent instructions to the contrary jointly submitted by the Parties, the proceeding would resume on 15 March 2021.\n\n160.\n\nOn 15 March 2021, the administrators of BSG Resources Limited updated the Tribunal on their unsuccessful attempts to further engage with the Respondent during the 35-day extension of stay and indicated they would continue to keep the Tribunal apprised of any developments.\n\n161.\n\nOn 22 March 2021, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the proceeding had resumed on 15 March 2021.\n\n162.\n\nOn 6 April 2021, the Centre invited again the Parties to make the payment that remained outstanding pursuant to the request for payment of advances on costs of 10 September 2018 and the notification of default of 21 January 2019 (as reduced by the payment made by the Claimants on 30 April 2019).\n\n163.\n\nOn 30 April 2021, the Claimants applied for permission to produce documents in the proceedings pending before the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York in which they are plaintiffs (\"New York Court Litigation\").\n\n164.\n\nOn 4 May 2021, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimants\u2019 application of 30 April 2021.\n\n165.\n\nOn 7 May 2021, the Respondent indicated that it had no objection to the Claimants\u2019 application.\n\n166.\n\nOn 17 May 2021, the Tribunal granted the Claimants\u2019 application for a permission to produce documents in the New York Court Litigation.\n\n167.\n\nOn 8 March 2022, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it was in the process of finalizing its award and reiterated its invitation to the Parties to make the payment that remained outstanding pursuant to the request for payment of advances on costs of 10 September 2018 and the notification of default of 21 January 2019 (as reduced by the payment made by the Claimants on 30 April 2019). The Tribunal also informed the Parties that in the absence of available funds to translate the Award, the Parties\u2019 failure to make the requested outstanding payment within two weeks would be understood as their consent to the Tribunal\u2019s issuing the Award in one language only.\n\n168.\n\nOn 21 March 2022, the administrators of BSG Resources Limited requested a 28-day stay of the proceeding to attempt to re-engage with the Respondent and re-activate the settlement discussions.\n\n169.\n\nOn 24 March 2022, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the administrators of BSG Resources Limited\u2019s request and indicated that it was \"minded, at this stage, to grant a suspension of the proceeding provided that the outstanding amount due pursuant to the request for further advances on costs dated September 10, 2018 - US$ 175,000 - is paid by either Party\".\n\n170.\n\nOn 24 March 2022, the Respondent expressed its firm opposition to the administrators of BSG Resources Limited\u2019s request for a stay of the proceeding.\n\n171.\n\nOn 29 March 2022, the Tribunal invited the Claimants to submit by 4 April 2022 any comments on the Respondent\u2019s communication of 24 March 2022.\n\n172.\n\nOn 4 April 2022, the administrators of BSG Resources Limited submitted comments on the Respondent\u2019s communication of 24 March 2022.\n\n173.\n\nThe proceedings were closed on 12 May 2022.\n\n**III. THE MAIN FACTS**\n-----------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe following summary provides a general overview of the present dispute. Additional facts will be discussed in the Tribunal\u2019s analysis. Except where otherwise stated, the facts in the following section are undisputed or deemed established. The Tribunal will refer to other facts in its analysis if and when appropriate.\n\n**A. The political background in Guinea between 2006 and 2014**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n175.\n\nFollowing its independence in 1958, the Republic of Guinea was ruled by President Sekou Tour\u00e9 and thereafter until 2008 by President Lansana Cont\u00e9. The period following between the death of President Lansana Cont\u00e9 in December 2008 until the election of President Alpha Cond\u00e9 at the end of 2010 was characterized by political turmoil and military rule. Captain Moussa Dadis Camara took over power in December 2008, but fled the country following an assassination attempt a year later, at which time General S\u00e9bouka Konat\u00e9 took over control until Alpha Cond\u00e9 finally won the first democratic election.\n\n176.\n\nThe government of the Republic of Guinea has been reshuffled on numerous occasions, including frequent changes of prime ministers and ministers of mines. Following the departure of Eug\u00e8ne Camara, Lansana Kouyat\u00e9 was Prime Minister between March 2007 and May 2008. He was succeeded by Dr. Ahmed Tidiane Souar\u00e9 from May 2008 to December 2008. Dr. Ahmed Tidiane Souar\u00e9 previously had been Minister of Mines between March 2005 and May 2006. He was succeeded by Dr. Ousmane Sylla (May 2006 to March 2007), who in turn was succeeded by Dr. Ahmed Kant\u00e9 (March 2007 to August 2008), Dr. Lounc\u00e9ny Nab\u00e9 (August 2008 to December 2008) and Mahmoud Thiam (January 2009 to December 2010).9\n\nSee: Reply, para. 57.\n\n177.\n\nAmong the facts just restated, two political events are particularly relevant to the present dispute. First, the death of President Lansana Cont\u00e9 on 22 December 2008. Indeed, the disputed mining rights for Blocks 1 & 2 were granted to BSGR Guinea shortly before, i.e. on 9 December 2008, which leads the Respondent to argue that President Cont\u00e9 was seriously ill and unduly influenced by people close to him, in particular by Ms. Mamadie Tour\u00e9 (the alleged fourth wife of President Cont\u00e9) when granting the rights.\n\n178.\n\nSecond, the election of President Alpha Cond\u00e9 in November-December 2010 plays an important part in the Claimants\u2019 case, according to which their mining rights were revoked because of allegedly corrupt demands of the new government. While the Respondent argues that President Cond\u00e9 inaugurated a new democratic and transparent regime focused on eradicating corruption in the mining industry, the Claimants argue that a corrupt deal brought President Cond\u00e9 to power in exchange for access to valuable mining rights (including the Claimants\u2019 mining rights subject to this dispute).\n\n**B. The corporate structure and key players of the BSG companies**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n179.\n\nThe Claimants are part of the Beny Steinmetz Group (\"BSG\").10 BSG is a group of companies ultimately owned by the Balda Foundation, a Liechtenstein trust, of which Mr. Steinmetz is a beneficiary according to the Claimants.11 Mr. Steinmetz himself specifies that he has \"no role on the board or as an employee of any of the BSG companies or of the Balda Foundation\", but is contracted to advise the individual companies making up BSG.12\n\nMr. Steinmetz explains that there is no legal entity called the \"BSG group\". See: Steinmetz WS1, para. 1.\n\nMem., para. 23. See also: Steinmetz WS1, para. 1.\n\nSteinmetz WS1, paras. 1, 15.\n\n180.\n\nThe Claimants explain that BSG operates globally in natural resources, real estate and the diamond industry. BSGR is BSG\u2019s natural resources company since 2003, with projects in Africa and countries of the former Soviet Union.13 BSGR\u2019s investments were principally made through in three subsidiaries: BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited (\"BSGR Guinea BVI\" or \"BSGR BVI\"), BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea.\n\n[REDACTED] The Claimants stated that BSGR is BSG's natural resources company since 1999, which is contested by the Respondent since BSGR was constituted in 2003. See: Mem., para. 23; CM, para. 58.\n\n181.\n\nBSGR's investment structure in Guinea was reorganized on several occasions between 2006 and 2015. The Claimants provide the following information on BSGR's investment structure up to November 2006:14\n\nMem., para. 28.\n\n182.\n\nBetween November 2006 and March 2008, BSGR held its investment as follows:15\n\nMem., para. 29.\n\n183.\n\nBetween March 2008 and January 2009, BSGR held its investments as follows:16\n\nMem., para. 30.\n\n184.\n\nBetween February 2009 and April 2010, BSGR Guernsey was inserted into the corporate structure and BSGR Guinea became a 100% subsidiary of the former:17\n\nMem., para. 31. [REDACTED]\n\n185.\n\nFollowing the sale of 51% of the shares in BSGR Guernsey to Vale S.A. in April 2010, the structure was as follows:18\n\nMem., para. 32.\n\n186.\n\nAccordingly, BSGR Guernsey was renamed \"VBG-Vale BSGR (Guinea) Limited\" and BSGR Guinea was renamed \"VBG-Vale BSGR (Guinea) SARL\".19\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n187.\n\nFinally, on 13 March 2015, BSGR repurchased Vale's shareholding, thus reverting to the pre-April 2010 corporate structure:20\n\nMem., para. 34. [REDACTED]\n\n188.\n\nThe Respondent provides a different account of the companies making up BSG, which it calls a \"nebulous structure\" concentrating power in the hands of few persons.21 According to the Respondent, Mr. Steinmetz is the founder and ultimate beneficiary of BSG and its companies. He is the \"principal beneficiary\" of the Balda Foundation, which is administered by Dr. Peter Goop, Mr. Marc Bonnant and the company Rothschild Trust Guernsey Limited.22 Through the company Nysco Management Corp., the Balda Foundation heads all the activities of BSG. For instance, on the day of BSGR\u2019s constitution, Nysco Management Corp. held 80% of its shares.\n\nCM, paras. 66-77 (Translated from the French).\n\nCM, para. 67, referring to [REDACTED]\n\n189.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent explains that BSG\u2019s activities are structured and managed through a \"myriad of companies\", mostly incorporated in tax havens. These include:23\n\n- Onyx Financial Advisors Ltd (\"Onyx BVI\"), whose principal shareholder is Mr. Dag Cramer;24  \n- Onyx Financial Advisors S.A. (\"Onyx Suisse\"), a subsidiary of Onyx BVI;25  \n- Margali Management Corp, a subsidiary of Onyx Suisse;26  \n- BSGR Steel Holdings Limited (\"BSGR Steel\"), a subsidiary of BSGR;27  \n- Windpoint Overseas Limited (\"Windpoint\"), whose shareholders are not known;28  \n- BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited (\"BSGR Guinea BVI\" or \"BSGR BVI\"), a subsidiary of BSGR Steel;29  \n- Onyx Financial Advisors (UK) Limited (\"Onyx UK\"), a subsidiary of Onyx Suisse;30  \n- BSGR Treasury Services (\"BSGR TS\"), most likely a subsidiary of BSGR;31  \n- Pentler Holdings Limited (\"Pentler\"), a subsidiary of Onyx BVI until February 2006.32\n\nCM, para. 69.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n190.\n\nThe following graph provides the structure of the BSG companies as described by the Respondent:33\n\nCM, p. 18.\n\n191.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that essentially two persons close to Mr. Steinmetz administer the complex structure of BSG, namely Ms. Sandra Merloni-Horemans and Mr. Dag Cramer.34\n\nCM, para. 71.\n\n192.\n\nMs. Merloni-Horemans (i) participated in Balda Foundation meetings, (ii) managed BSGR, Onyx BVI, Onyx Suisse, Onyx UK and Margali, and (iii) as manager of Margali, signed documents for BSGR Guernsey, BSGR Steel, BSGR BVI, BSGR TS, Pentler and Windpoint.35\n\nCM, para. 73.\n\n193.\n\nMr. Cramer (i) participated in Balda Foundation meetings, (ii) was the sole shareholder of the Onyx companies, (iii) managed BSGR, Margali and Onyx UK and was CEO and CFO of Onyx UK, and (iv) as manager of Margali, was authorized to sign documents of BSGR Guernsey, BSGR Steel, BSGR BVI, BSGR TS and Windpoint.\n\n194.\n\nThe following graph depicts the role of Ms. Merloni-Horemans and Mr. Cramer, as presented by the Respondent:36\n\nCM, p. 21.\n\n195.\n\nThe Respondent also particularly points to Pentler, an offshore company allegedly created by BSG as a vehicle to implement and veil its alleged \"corrupt scheme\". That company was incorporated in the BVI by the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca on 28 October 2005 on behalf of Onyx BVI, its sole director being Margali.37 The following graph depicts the Respondent\u2019s position in regard to the shareholder structure of BSGR, BSGR BVI, Onyx BVI and Pentler as of 13 February 2006:38\n\n[REDACTED] CM, paras. 152-154 (Translated from the French).\n\nCM, p. 44.\n\n196.\n\nFinally, the Respondent identifies six other persons who allegedly played a key role during the activities of BSGR Guinea, which are the subject to the present dispute:39\n\n- Mr. Roy Oron, CEO of BSGR until 2007;  \n- Mr. Marc Struik, COO between 2005 and 2007 and CEO of BSGR since 2007;  \n- Mr. Asher Avidan, project leader (2006), country manager (2006-2010) and president of BSGR since 2010;  \n- Mr. Joseph (\"Yossie\") Tchelet, Strategic Financial Specialist of BSG since 2008;  \n- Mr. David Clark, Director and Treasurer of BSG (2007-2012);  \n- Mr. David Barnett, legal director of BSG (2004-2012).\n\nCM, para. 73.\n\n**C. The Claimants\u2019 mining activities in Guinea**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nAlthough the present dispute centers around two iron ore mining areas, namely the Zogota and the Simandou projects (see below), the Parties refer to other mining projects undertaken by the Claimants in Guinea as part of the general context in support of their respective cases.\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimants highlight various BSGR projects throughout Africa to underline the companies\u2019 mining experience. Thus, the Claimants argue that by 2005, the BSGR group had \"a significant and diverse portfolio of mining and metal assets\" in South Africa,40 Sierra Leone,41 Zambia42 and the DRC.43\n\nIncluding a controlling stake, through its subsidiary Arctic Resources, in Anglovaale Mining, a public company with precious metal, base metal, ferrous metal and diamond interests across Southern Africa; a 20% strategic stake in the iron asset Kumba and the steel producer Iscor, in South Africa. See: Steinmetz WS1, para. 13(c)-(d); Mem., paras. 23 and 38.\n\nIncluding investing in the Octea Diamond Group that operates the Koidu Diamond mine. See: Steinmetz WS1, para. 13(a); Mem., paras. 23 and 38.\n\nIncluding owning and operating between 2003 and 2009 the Luanshya Copper Mines. See: Steinmetz WS1, para. 13(h); Mem., paras. 23 and 38.\n\nIncluding founding Nikanor Plc, which focused on exploration and production of copper and cobalt and merged with Katanga Mining in 2008. See: Steinmetz WS1, para. 13(i).\n\n199.\n\nFor its part, the Respondent indicates that BSGR requested 13 bauxite prospecting permits in January 2006, which requests were granted by ministerial decree dated 9 May 2006.44 In addition, on 5 February 2007, BSGR requested survey licenses for uranium prospection.45 The Ministry of Mines granted four uranium prospecting permits on 28 February 2007.46 On 30 April 2008, BSGR informed Minister Kante of its proposal to return a total of 9 permits, composed of 4 uranium and 5 bauxite permits.47\n\nCM, paras. 219-223; Reply, Annex 1, para. 52.

See also: Reply, Annex 1, para. 54.\n\n200.\n\nAlthough the bauxite and uranium mining rights are not *stricto sensu* part of the present dispute, the Respondent mentions them in support of its case on the alleged general scheme of the Claimants to obtain mining rights through corruption.48\n\nSee: CM, paras. 218-247; Rejoinder, paras. 141, 627-668. For the Claimants' response to the allegation that the bauxite and uranium permits are tainted by corruption, see: Reply, Annex 1, paras. 49-55.\n\n201.\n\nBearing the foregoing in mind, the present dispute concerns two iron ore deposits located in the southeastern part of Guinea, namely the Zogota project (situated in South Simandou) (section C) and Blocks 1 and 2 (section D). The following map shows the location of the two areas:49\n\nMem., p. 16.\n\n202.\n\nThe following map shows the known iron ore deposits (depicted in yellow) in Simandou and Zogota:50\n\nCM, para. 96.\n\n203.\n\nThe remaining sections focus on the main facts concerning the process of obtaining mining rights for the Zogota and Simandou projects and the subsequent cancellation of those rights in April 2014.\n\n**D. The Zogota project**\n-------------------------\n\n204.\n\nAs of 2005, BSGR became aware of vast iron ore deposits in the Simandou area, a mountain range in southeastern Guinea,51 spanning from the prefecture of K\u00e9rouan\u00e9 in the North to the prefectures of Beyla, Macenta, Nz\u00e9r\u00e9kor\u00e9 and Yomou in the South.\n\nMem., para. 39.\n\n205.\n\nIn January 2006, BSGR applied for prospecting permits for iron ore in areas to the North and South of the Simandou mining area operated by Rio Tinto since 1997.52 On 6 February 2006, the Minister of Mines, Dr. Ahmed Tidiane Souare, issued two decrees granting a number of prospecting permits to the North and to the South of the Simandou mountain range.53\n\nSee: Attestation de M. Cilins, 26 novembre 2012 (Exh.

C-5).\n\n206.\n\nThe first decree covered three prospecting permits in the prefecture of Kerouane covering 1286 km2, which were valid for three years (the \"North Simandou Permits\").54 The second decree awarded four prospecting permits in the prefectures of Beyla, Macenta, Nzerekore and Yomou covering 2047 km2, again for three years (the \"South Simandou Permits\"; together the \"North and South Simandou Permits\").55 The area of the second decree is known as Zogota.\n\nThis is designation used by the Claimants. See, e.g.: Mem., para. 44. The Respondent calls this area \"Nord Simandou\" and designates Blocks 1 & 2 as \"Simandou Nord (Blocs 1 et 2)\". See: CM, para. 94 (Translated from the French).\n\nThis is designation used by the Claimants. See, e.g.: Mem., para. 44. The Respondent calls this area \"Sud Simandou\" and designates Blocks 3 & 4 as \"Simandou Sud (Blocs 3 et 4)\". See: CM, para. 94 (Translated from the French).\n\n207.\n\nAfter several years, BSGR Guernsey retroceded to the State the mining area covered by the North Simandou Permits.56 That area is therefore not the subject of the present dispute and facts stated in this connection merely provide general context. The present dispute relates to the Zogota mining area.\n\nSee, e.g.: Letter from BSGR to Minister Kant\u00e9 dated 30 April 2008 (Exh. C-195).\n\n208.\n\nThe following map filed by the Respondent depicts the locations of the North Simandou (designated by the Respondent as \"Nord Simandou\" and by the Claimants as \"Simandou North\") and South Simandou Permits (designated by the Respondent as \"Sud Simandou\" and by the Claimants \"Simandou South\"),57 South Simandou being Zogota.58\n\nCM, para. 94.\n\nCartes du Mont Simandou: Blocs 1 \u00e0 4, Nord Simandou et Sud Simandou (Exh.

The Simandou project**\n---------------------------\n\n213.\n\nThe area south of the North Simandou Permits and north of the South Simandou Permits (Zogota) forms part of the Simandou mining area that pertained to Rio Tinto between 1997 and 2008. It comprises four blocks designated as Blocks 1 & 2 to the north and Blocks 3 & 4 to the south.73\n\nThe Respondent designates Blocks 1 & 2 as \"Simandou Nord\" and Blocks 3 & 4 as \"Simandou Sud\". See: CM, para. 83.\n\n214.\n\nThe following map shows the mining areas covered by Blocks 1 to 4:74\n\nCartes du Mont Simandou: Blocs 1 \u00e0 4, Nord Simandou et Sud Simandou (Exh.

However, no retrocession was ever undertaken.\n\nCM, para. 83.\n\nCM, para. 84.\n\nCM, para. 86, referring to Arr\u00eat\u00e9 n\u00ba A2002/5371/MMGE/SGG renouvelant le permis n\u00ba A2000/1484/MMGE/SGG (Bloc I) accord\u00e9 \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Rio Tinto, 16 octobre 2002 (Exh.

BSGR unsuccessfully applied for mining rights in Blocks 1 & 2 on 12 July 2007.85 It applied again in respect of Blocks 1 & 2 on 30 April 2008, but the Minister of Mines Kante rejected that application on 10 July 2008 stating that those blocks were under concession.86 Following the \"withdrawal\" or \"suspension\" of Rio Tinto\u2019s mining concession on 28 July 2008, BSGR reapplied again for mining rights over Blocks 1 to 3 on 5 August 2008.87\n\nReply, paras. 87-88, referring to Lettre de M.

The joint venture with Vale and the LCIA arbitration**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n223.\n\nIn February 2010, BSGR entered into negotiations with Vale for the creation of a joint venture and the sale of a stake in BSGR Guernsey.97 On 19 March 2010, the Minister of Mines Mahmoud Thiam wrote to Vale giving assurances about the validity of BSGR\u2019s mining rights.98 On 16 April 2010, BSGR informed Minister Thiam of the ongoing negotiations, to which the Claimants say he did not object.99\n\nMem., para. 88.\n\nMem., para. 89, referring to Letter from Minister of Mines Mahmoud Thiam to E Ledsham of Vale dated 19 March 2010 (Exh.

See: Mem., para. 97, referring to Letter from Ministry of Mines to BSGR dated 1 November 2010 (Exh. C-30).\n\nCM, paras. 449-470.\n\n225.\n\nFollowing the revocation of the disputed mining rights in April 2014, Vale initiated a LCIA arbitration against BSGR on 28 April 2014 requesting damages in the amount of USD 3 billion on the grounds that its consent was vitiated and that BSGR dissimulated key information about corrupt practices during Vale's due diligence.103\n\nCM, paras. 712-713, referring to [REDACTED]\n\n**G. The 2011 Mining Code and the mining permit review procedure**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n226.\n\nTo root out corruption, the newly-elected President Alpha Cond\u00e9 initiated a reform of the mining sector and, in September 2011, the National Council of Transition adopted a new mining code (the \"2011 Mining Code\"), which replaced the 1995 Mining Code.104\n\nCM, para. 527, referring to Code Minier de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e, 2011 (Exh. RL-18) (Translated from the French).\n\n227.\n\nOn 29 March 2012, President Cond\u00e9 put in place a review process of existing mining rights and conventions under the aegis of the NMC.105 For this purpose, a Technical Committee, an operational organ composed of 18 members of different agencies, and a Strategic Committee, a political organ composed of five ministers, were established.106\n\nCM, para. 529, referring to D\u00e9cret D/2012/045/PRG/SGG portant modalit\u00e9s de mise en \u0153uvre d'un Programme de revue des Titres et Conventions miniers par la Commission Nationale des Mines, 29 mars 2012 (Exh. C-51).\n\nCM, paras. 532-536.\n\n228.\n\nThe Respondent argues that these committees properly reviewed the 19 existing mining projects in Guinea.107 By contrast, the Claimants submit that the review targeted only BSGR because the latter had resisted President Cond\u00e9's \"extortion attempts\", when the other mining right holders had acceded to his payment requests.108 In addition, the Claimants argue that President Cond\u00e9 instructed Revenue Watch Institute, which is funded by George Soros, to assist the Technical Committee in reviewing BSGR's mining rights \"first\".109 Finally, the Claimants argue that the review process was \"rotten to its core\" and breached the Claimants' due process rights.110\n\nCM, para. 539.\n\nMem., para. 133; Reply, paras. 226(v) and 227; Avidan (CWS-3), paras. 95-100; Cramer (CWS-7), paras. 17-23.\n\nReply, para. 252 and fn. 236.\n\nMem., para. 134; Reply, para. 253.\n\n**H. The revocation of the disputed mining rights**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n229.\n\nOn 14 January 2011, President Cond\u00e9 and members of BSGR Guinea discussed the development of railway infrastructure and Vale's acquisition of a 51% stake in BSGR Guernsey.111 On 8 February 2011, President Cond\u00e9 and the Minister of Transportation, Ahmed Tidiane Traor\u00e9 again met a delegation of BSGR Guinea. According to the Respondent, President Cond\u00e9 proposed on that occasion to approve the joint venture with Vale against the payment of 50% of the price of the sale to Vale.112 The Claimants regard that demand for USD 1,25 billion to be an improper and unjustified attempt to share in the proceeds of the Vale transaction. They also note that at that time they had only received USD 500 million from Vale.113\n\nCM, para. 546, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 547.\n\nMem., paras. 106-108.\n\n230.\n\nFollowing the setting up of the mining permit review process in March 2012 (see above),114 the Technical Committee sent an Allegations Letter to BSGR Guinea on 30 October 2012 where it \"accused the BSGR group of obtaining mining titles by bribery and corruption\".115 Vale responded to that letter on behalf of BSGR Guinea on 26 November 2012116 and BSGR answered on 26 December 2012.117\n\nThe Parties also call attention to the legal advice provided by Heenan Blaikie on 20 December 2011 (Exh.

The Technical Committee responded on 4 December 2012 to a first response by BSGR dated 28 November 2012, stating that only BSGR Guinea was part to the proceedings as title holder, not BSGR. In the subsequent communications, BSGR Guinea (which was at that time controlled by Vale) responded to requests for comments that only BSGR could respond to allegations relating to the period 2006 to 2010. See: CM, para. 630.\n\n231.\n\nBSGR Guinea stated its willingness to cooperate with the investigation of the Technical Committee and did not challenge the legality of the process when BSGR disputed the legality of the procedure and ultimately decided not to cooperate with the investigation.118 BSGR also requested on various occasions the disclosure of the evidence relied upon by the Technical Committee in support of the Allegations Letter.119\n\nSee, e.g.: CM, paras. 638, 640, 641, 645.\n\nMem., para. 128.\n\n232.\n\nIn March 2013, the President of BSGR, Mr. Avidan, was declared *persona non grata* in Guinea with no formal notice.120 On 16 and 19 April 2013, two BSGR Guinea employees, Messrs. Bangoura and I.S. Tour\u00e9, were imprisoned on the ground of passive corruption and were only released on 29 November 2013.121 The Claimants also call attention to various statements made by President Cond\u00e9, including one on 21 October 2013 where he stated that his government had \"started a battle to recover our mines which were acquired fraudulently\".122\n\nMem., para. 130(i); Avidan (CWS-3), paras. 102-103.\n\nMem., para. 130(ii); Reply, paras. 229-236.

REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants\u2019 requests for relief**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n241.\n\nIn their amended Memorial,142 the Claimants request that the Tribunal issue an award:\n\n(i) Declaring that Guinea\u2019s termination of each of the Base Convention, the Zogota Mining Concession and the Blocks 1 & 2 Permit was illegal and unlawful;\n\n(ii) Declaring that Guinea\u2019s expropriation and/or nationalization of BSGR\u2019s indirect and BSGR Guernsey\u2019s direct shareholding in BSGR Guinea, and BSGR\u2019s shareholding in BSGr Guernsey, was illegal and unlawful;\n\n(iii) Declaring that Guinea unlawfully failed to ensure that the Claimants\u2019 rights were protected in accordance with Guinean and/or international law.\n\n(iv) Ordering that Guinea forthwith:\n\na) Restore the Base Convention and observe the rights granted to BSGR Guinea and to BSGR Guernsey under the Base Convention;\n\nb) Restore the Zogota Mining Concession and observe the rights granted to BSGR Guinea under the Zogota Mining Concession;\n\nc) Restore the Blocks 1 and 2 Permit and observe the rights granted to BSGR Guinea under the Blocks 1 and 2 Permit;\n\nd) Ensure that BSGR Guernsey\u2019s and BSGR Guinea\u2019s respective rights, assets and investments are protected in accordance with Guinean and international law;\n\ne) Prevent BSGR Guernsey\u2019s and BSGR Guinea\u2019s respective rights, assets and investments from being further subject to expropriation and/or nationalization or to any measure having similar effect;\n\nf) Ensure that BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea and their respective investments are treated in a non-discriminatory manner.\n\ng) Ensure that each of BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea have:\n\na. the right to dispose freely of their property and to organize their enterprise as they wish;\n\nb. the freedom of hiring and firing, subject to prevailing laws and regulations;\n\nc. unlimited access to raw materials;\n\nd. the freedom of circulation of personnel and products within the Republic of Guinea;\n\ne. the freedom to import goods and services and any necessary funds; and\n\nf. the freedom to dispose of their products on international markets and to export and dispose of products in foreign markets.\n\n(v) Ordering that Guinea:\n\na) ensure that an accurate summary of the Award is published in the Financial Times (in A3 size) within 30 days of the date of the Award and at the expense of Guinea; and\n\nb) submit the summary of the Award for approval to the Claimants 15 days before publication. Failing an agreement between the Claimants and Guinea on the text of the summary, the text of the summary will be determined by the Tribunal.\n\n(vi) Ordering that Guinea provide prompt, adequate and effective compensation to the Claimants for Guinea's unlawful conduct, described above, in an amount in US dollars to be quantified during this arbitration, as compensation for the losses suffered to date and for any future losses suffered by the Claimants.\n\n(vii) Ordering that Guinea provide an indemnity and/or prompt, adequate and effective compensation to BSGR, in respect of any losses which BSGR suffers (or might suffer) as a result of the claims brought by Vale against BSGR in LCIA Arbitration No. 14283.\n\n(viii) Ordering that Guinea provide prompt adequate and effective compensation and/or a *quantum meruit* in respect of the investments made and/or work done and/or services performed by the Claimants (or each of them), and for which Guinea has taken the benefit but (as yet) provided no compensation;\n\n(ix) Ordering that Guinea pay moral damages in the amount to be determined in the course of these proceedings.\n\n(x) Ordering that Guinea pay interest on such sums and for such periods as the Tribunal deems appropriate.\n\n(xi) Ordering that Guinea pay the Claimants' costs occasioned by this arbitration including, without limitation, arbitrators' fees, administrative costs fixed by ICSID, the arbitrators' expenses, the fees and expenses of any experts, and the legal costs incurred by the parties.\n\n(xii) Granting the Claimants all other relief that the Tribunal deems appropriate.\n\nMem., para. 431.\n\n242.\n\nThe Claimants further specified that Guinea \"remains liable for any future loss suffered by the Claimants (and each of them)\",143 and noted that, since the proceedings have been bifurcated, remedies were left for a separate phase of the proceedings.144 Finally, the Claimants reserved their right to add to, modify and/or amend their requested relief.145\n\nMem., para. 432.\n\nMem., para. 430.\n\nMem., para. 433.\n\n243.\n\nThese requests were not repeated in the Reply, and thus remained unchanged.146 However, the Claimants agreed with the Respondent\u2019s position that the \"only real issue in this arbitration is whether BSGR acquired its mining rights in Guinea by corruption\".147 In this context, the Claimants request that the Tribunal find that BSGR \"did not procure the expropriated mining rights by bribing Mamadie Tour\u00e9 and/or President Cont\u00e9 nor by bribing any other Guinean government or public official\".148 Accordingly, the Claimants also request that the Tribunal dismiss Guinea\u2019s counterclaims.149\n\nCf.

Rejoinder, para. 1096 and CM, para. 1167.\n\n245.\n\nThe Respondent further reserved all rights.\n\n**V. OVERVIEW OF THE PARTIES\u2019 POSITIONS**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n246.\n\nThis section only provides a summary of the Parties' positions. The Tribunal will refer to more detailed positions of the Parties in its analysis of each issue before it.\n\n**A. Summary of the Claimants\u2019 position**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n247.\n\nIn essence, the Claimants argue that the disputed mining rights were obtained lawfully and not by way of corruption. Furthermore, the Claimants argue that the disputed mining rights were revoked unlawfully as a result of a corrupt scheme surrounding President Alpha Cond\u00e9, and that the circumstances surrounding the revocations breached the Claimants' rights under the Guinean Investment Code, the 1995 Mining Code, the BOT Act, the Base Convention and international law.\n\n248.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Respondent unlawfully and forcibly withdrew and revoked the following \"highly valuable investments held and/or made by the Claimants\":151\n\n(i) The so-called Zogota Mining Concession, i.e., an iron ore mining concession granted to BSGR Guinea on 19 March 2010 over an area of 1,024 km2 on Mount Younon in South Simandou;\n\n(ii) The so-called Base Convention, i.e., a mining and infrastructure agreement dated 16 December 2009 entered into by BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea with the Republic of Guinea regarding largely (though not exclusively) the rights and obligations arising from the Zogota Mining Concession; and\n\n(iii) The Blocks 1 & 2 Permit, i.e., a prospecting permit granted to BSGR Guinea over an area referred to as Simandou Blocks 1 and 2 (covering an area of 369 km2 in the prefecture of K\u00e9rouan\u00e9) granted on 9 December 2008, giving rise to (i) an exclusive right to prospect for iron ore and (ii) a right to develop and operate the area (by way of operating permit or mining concession) upon completion of a feasibility study.152\n\nMem., para. 4.\n\nMem., para. 4, items (i)-(iii).\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimants argue that \"those and other vested rights\" were expropriated and/or nationalized by three executive orders, the effect of which \"was *inter alia* to strip BSGR Guinea of all of its relevant assets\", as well as BSGR Guernsey\u2019s 100% shareholding in BSGR Guinea, and BSGR\u2019s shareholding in BSGR Guernsey and its indirect shareholding in BSGR Guinea.153\n\nMem., paras. 5, 13.\n\n250.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants claim that Guinea\u2019s unlawful conduct further breached various provisions of Guinea\u2019s Investment Code (Articles 5, 6 and 30), Mining Code (Articles 11, 21, 22, 26, 41 and 43), the BOT Act (Articles 7.1, 7.2.2, 7.2.7 and 7.2.12), as well as the Base Convention and international law.154\n\nMem., para. 14.\n\n**B. Summary of the Respondent\u2019s position**\n-------------------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nIn addition to various preliminary objections,155 the Respondent argues that the Claimants\u2019 purported mining rights are null and void since they were allegedly obtained through fraudulent conduct and corrupt practices. More specifically, the Respondent argues that the Claimants introduced themselves to the highest levels of the Guinean State through President Conte\u2019s alleged fourth wife, Ms. Mamadie Tour\u00e9 and that they obtained the disputed mining rights by buying the influence of \"intermediaries\" or \"consultants\" and bribing public officials.\n\nCf. CM, Annex 1; Rejoinder, Annex 1.\n\n252.\n\nAccordingly, all the claims are inadmissible or, alternatively, meritless. In this context, the Respondent\u2019s counterclaims seek to obtain reparation for the economic and moral damages incurred as a result of the corrupt practices prior to obtaining the disputed mining rights, as well as for the moral damages incurred as a result of the Claimants\u2019 public media campaign.156\n\nCM, para. 1126.\n\n**VI. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n**A. Preliminary Matters**\n--------------------------\n\n253.\n\nPrior to entering the merits of the dispute, the Tribunal will address the applicable procedural law (1), the law governing jurisdiction (2) and the merits of the dispute (3), as well as the relevance of previous decisions or awards (4), and the scope of this Award (5).\n\n**1. Applicable Procedural Law**\n--------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThis investment arbitration is governed by (i) the ICSID Convention, (ii) the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of 10 April 2006 and (iii) the procedural orders adopted in the course of this proceeding, in particular Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n255.\n\nAt the first session, the Parties agreed on the application of the UNCITRAL Transparency Rules, with a number of adjustments as set out in PO2. More specifically, and subject to confidentiality, the Parties agreed to make the following documents available to the public: the written submissions, the exhibits, legal authorities, witness statements, and expert reports (including any appended exhibits), the transcripts of hearings, the orders, decisions and the award of the Tribunal. The Parties further agreed to broadcast the hearings and make them accessible by video link on the ICSID website. These agreements were subject to the protection of \"confidential or protected\" information as addressed in PO2. ICSID acts as the Repository of published information.\n\n**2. Law Governing Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n256.\n\nIt is common ground that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention governs the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction and the Tribunal\u2019s competence. In other words, jurisdiction is governed by international law. National law may be relevant to the interpretation and application of certain jurisdictional requirements depending on the issue in question.\n\n257.\n\nThis being so, to fulfill the requirement of consent embodied in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Claimants rely on provisions in national legislation and in the Base Convention to which the Tribunal will revert in its analysis of jurisdiction (VI.B.2.a). In other words, this is not a treaty arbitration.\n\n**3. Law Governing the Merits**\n-------------------------------\n\n258.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\n259.\n\nIt is common ground that Guinean law applies to the merits of this arbitration. The Claimants allege breaches of the Guinean Investment Code, the Mining Code, the BOT Act and the Base Convention, all of which are governed by Guinean law. Article 2 of the Investment Code states that any person is free to invest in Guinea in conformity with the \"laws and regulations of the Republic\". Article 2 of the Mining Code provides that mining operations \"in the territory of the Republic of Guinea [...] are governed by the provisions of this Mining Code and all its ancillary provisions\". Moreover, Article 13.1 of the BOT Act stipulates that a BOT agreement is \"governed by legislation determined jointly by the State and the Investor; in the absence of indication, the Guinean law in force on the date of signing the BOT Agreement shall be deemed applicable\". Finally, Clause 5 of the Base Convention states that the agreement \"is governed by the Applicable Laws of the Republic of Guinea\", \"applicable law\" being defined as \"the Mining Code and other laws, regulations and decrees, and any other legislative instrument of Guinean law, including rules, regulations, resolutions or other directives or standards that require compliance, published officially, having the force of law, and in effect at the time of their application\".\n\n260.\n\nThe Parties further agree that international law has a bearing on the merits of the claims. The Claimants also allege breaches of rules of customary international law and point to the fact that Article 5 of the Investment Code and Article 21 of the Mining Code specifically refer to rules of international law. In the same vein, the Respondent invokes international law to justify the conduct of its officials.\n\n261.\n\nFinally, the parties disagree on the law applicable to corruption, a topic that the Tribunal will address in its analysis below (VI.C.2.a)\n\n262.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal holds that, under the first leg of Article 42(1), Guinean and international law apply to the merits of this case.\n\n**4. Relevance of Previous Decisions**\n--------------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nIn support of their positions, both sides have relied on previous decisions or awards, either to conclude that the same solutions should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from a solution reached by another tribunal.\n\n264.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the same time, it is of the opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions of international tribunals. It considers that, subject to the specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the actual case, it has a duty to seek to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards legal certainty and the rule of law.\n\n**5. Scope of this Award**\n--------------------------\n\n265.\n\nThis award deals with the Respondent's jurisdictional defenses (VI.B), the Claimants\u2019 claims that their investment in Guinea has been expropriated (VI.C), and the Respondent's counterclaims that the Claimants are liable in damages because they breached Guinean law by engaging in corrupt dealings (VI.D). As reflected in PO1, the Tribunal and the Parties agreed to bifurcate jurisdiction and liability from quantum. Accordingly, and in light of the outcome on liability, this Award does not address quantum.\n\n266.\n\nThe Claimants essentially argue that BSGR Guinea's mining rights were expropriated as a result of extortion attempts and corrupt dealings within the Guinean government. In addition to raising jurisdictional defenses, the Respondent mainly objects that the disputed mining rights were obtained through corruption and were therefore lawfully revoked. In their Reply, the Claimants agreed with the Respondent that the \"only real issue in this arbitration is whether BSGR acquired its mining rights in Guinea by corruption\".157 They further stated that \"all other issues, be it jurisdiction, admissibility or expropriation, centre around the issue of corruption\".158\n\nReply, para. 4.\n\nReply, para. 4.\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the corruption allegations are at the core of this dispute. As will be seen below, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent's allegations of corruption go to the admissibility of the claims. Thus, subject to the outcome of the jurisdictional objections (VI.B), the Tribunal will review the legal framework governing corruption (VI.C.2) and then assess the Respondent\u2019s corruption defense (VI.C.3).\n\n268.\n\nIn this latter context, the Tribunal will start by examining the authenticity of various documents which the Respondent invokes in support of its corruption assertions and which the Claimants allege to be forged or of doubtful authenticity (VI.C.3.b).\n\n**B. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n**1. The Parties' positions**\n-----------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n269.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the majority of the claims.159 Guinea argues that the Claimants fail to establish the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over each Claimant for each legal basis which they invoke in support of their claims, and that they interpret the various offers to arbitrate too extensively.160 While the Claimants have in common the same ultimate beneficiary and acted in concert, they do not have the same nationality nor do they hold the same rights. Moreover, while it asserts that the issue of corruption is at the heart of the dispute and affects the admissibility and, alternatively, the merits of the claims, the Respondent, unlike the Claimants, considers that its jurisdictional objections are unrelated to acts of corruption.161\n\nCM, Annex 1; Rejoinder, Annex 1.\n\nCM, Annex, 1, para. 2.\n\nRejoinder, Annex 1, para. 3.\n\n270.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Respondent\u2019s position on jurisdiction:162\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Fondement \u00e0 la competence invoqu\u00e9 par les Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s BSGR Droits Miniers auxquels se rapportent les demandes des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s BSGR | Code des investissements | Code Minier 1995 | Loi BOT | Convention de Base de Zogota |\n| Convention de Base de Zogota / Concession Zogota | Le Tribunal est *comp\u00e9tent* \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard des demandes des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s BSGR. | Le Tribunal est *incomp\u00e9tent* \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de l\u2019ensemble des demandes des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s BSGR, en raison de la comp\u00e9tence exclusive des juridictions administratives guin\u00e9ennes.

By contrast, the Respondent (ii) objects to jurisdiction over claims under the 1995 Mining Code and the BOT Act. Finally, the Respondent argues that (iii) the Tribunal only has jurisdiction under the Base Convention as regards claims relating to Zogota brought by BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea (to the exclusion of BSGR), and (iv) lacks jurisdiction under the Base Convention in respect of claims relating to Blocks 1 & 2.\n\n272.\n\nWith respect to (i), for reasons of procedural efficiency, the Respondent provides its consent to treat BSGR Guinea, a Guinean company, as a foreign national for the purposes of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.163\n\nCM, Annex 1, paras. 3, 5-8.\n\n273.\n\nWith respect to (ii), the Respondent argues that Article 171 of the 1995 Mining Code provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Guinean courts over administrative acts and that Article 184 does not cover disputes over the existence of mining rights (but only over the extent of such rights).164 In the present case, the dispute exclusively deals with the validity of the revocation and cancellation, hence with the existence, of the disputed mining rights. Furthermore, for Guinea, the Claimants adopt an overly broad interpretation of Article 184 according to which national courts are only residually competent and must give way to arbitration.165 An extensive reading of Article 184 would be contrary to \"principles of international law\", such as the principle that unilateral acts of States, including offers to arbitrate contained in legislation,166 must be interpreted restrictively.167 Further, so says the Respondent, the Claimants cannot seriously argue that the 1995 Mining Code is irrelevant to ascertain jurisdiction because it was superseded by the 2011 Mining Code, when their claims rest on the 1995 Code.168 The disputed mining rights were issued when the 1995 Mining Code was still in force and therefore that legislation governs their revocation.169 In fact, the revocation decrees only refer to the 2011 Mining Code in relation to the review procedure leading to the revocation.170\n\nCM, Annex 1, paras. 10-14; Rejoinder, Annex 1, paras. 5-26.\n\nRejoinder, Annex 1, para. 16.\n\nSee, for instance: *Mobil Corporation, Venezuela Holdings, B.V. et al. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/27, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 June 2010, para. 85 (Exh. RL-118).\n\nRejoinder, Annex 1, para. 18, referring to Commission du droit international des Nations Unies, *Principes directeurs applicables aux d\u00e9clarations unilat\u00e9rales des Etats susceptibles de cr\u00e9er des obligations juridiques* (2006), art. 7 (Exh.

The Respondent argues that Article 1 of the Base Convention, which defines the activities under the convention, does not mention infrastructure projects. Similarly, Article 4 relating to BSGR Guernsey's obligations does not mention infrastructure projects either. More generally, the Base Convention does not refer to the BOT Act, although it refers to numerous other legislative acts. Finally, none of the standard clauses of a BOT agreement are contained in the Base Convention.\n\nRejoinder, Annex 1, para. 43.\n\nRejoinder, Annex 1, paras. 46-48.\n\nCM, Annex 1, paras. 32-33; Rejoinder, Annex 1, paras. 42, 51-53.\n\nRejoinder, Annex 1, para. 43.\n\n276.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimants\u2019 argument that the disputed mining rights were revoked as a result of a corrupt scheme implemented by President Alpha Cond\u00e9 to reward his political backers during the 2010 presidential election. It also disputes that the Claimants were expropriated of their mining rights or otherwise treated unfairly or in a discriminatory manner. For the Respondent, there is substantial evidence demonstrating that the Claimants secured their mining rights through corruption, thus justifying the revocation of the mining rights.\n\n277.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants entered Guinea at a time when a \"generalized climate of corruption\" prevailed.178 They had recourse to Ms. Tour\u00e9, whom the Respondent describes as President Cont\u00e9\u2019s fourth wife and the central figure in the corrupt scheme, to influence President Cont\u00e9 in awarding the disputed mining rights to the BSGR companies.179 More specifically, Guinea asserts that the Claimants started putting in place a fraudulent scheme in 2005 by introducing themselves at all relevant levels of governmental authority, setting up shell companies through which they paid bribes to gain access to mining rights, following which they sought to buy the silence of those implicated.\n\nCM, para. 6 (Translated from the French).\n\nCM, para. 5.\n\n**b. Claimants\u2019 position**\n--------------------------\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimants first argue that the four conditions set out in Article 25(1) of the Convention are met. There is a (i) legal dispute about Guinea\u2019s alleged breaches of the Guinean Investment Code, the Mining Code, the BOT Act and the Base Convention.180 That dispute (ii) \"arose directly out of an investment\", namely the alleged \"unlawful withdrawal and/or termination\" of the disputed mining permits;181 (iii) between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, i.e. the Republic of Guinea on the one hand182 and BSGR, BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea, the first two incorporated in Guernsey, which is a British Crown dependency183 and the third being treated with Guinea\u2019s agreement as a national of another Contracting State under Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention.184 Finally, (iv) the \"Parties have consented in writing to ICSID Arbitration\", i.e. pursuant to Article 38 of the Base Convention,185 Article 28(2) of the Investment Code,186 Article 184 of the Mining Code187 and Article 13(2) of the BOT Act.188\n\nMem., paras. 375-376.\n\nMem., paras. 377-394.\n\nMem., para. 396. The Claimants indicate that Guinea signed the ICSID Convention on 27 August 1968 and deposited its instrument of ratification on 4 November 1968.\n\nMem., paras. 397-399. The Claimants indicate that the ICSID Convention entered into force in the United Kingdom on 18 January 1967 and that Guernsey was designated as a constituent subdivision pursuant to Article 25(1) and (3) of the Convention on 11 June 1973.\n\nMem., paras. 400-403. The Claimants point in particular to Articles 1 (definition of control), 7, 36.2, 38.2 and Annex 1 of the Base Convention.\n\nMem., paras. 405-407.\n\nMem., paras. 408-412.\n\nMem., paras. 413-424.\n\nMem., paras. 425-429.\n\n279.\n\nThe Claimants highlight that the Respondent accepted in its Counter-Memorial that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over BSGR Guinea (Claimant 3). According to the Claimants, the Respondent did not either dispute the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over BSGR and BSGR Guernsey, and therefore the Tribunal should conclude that it has such jurisdiction over them.189\n\nReply, para. 451.\n\n280.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine claims (i) under the 1995 Mining Code, (ii) over Blocks 1 & 2, and (iii) under the BOT Act.\n\n281.\n\nIn connection with (i), the Claimants submit that the Respondent erroneously relies on Article 171 of the 1995 Mining Code, which grants exclusive jurisdiction to Guinea's administrative courts. Under Article 184, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to entertain disputes concerning an investor's rights and obligations. Guinea's distinction between the existence and the extent of such rights must be rejected.190 The Claimants also assert that Article 171 covers administrative acts \"issued under this Code\", and therefore does not extend to administrative acts taken pursuant to the 2011 Mining Code.191 Finally, the Claimants counter the Respondent's position that BSGR has no standing under the 1995 Mining Code since it is not the titleholder. While the Claimants do not dispute that BSGR held no mining title, they argue that neither Article 184 nor any other provision of the code defines the term \"mining investor\".192 Therefore, the ordinary meaning of this term should not be construed restrictively, and BSGR must be considered a mining investor since it provided the funds flowing into Guinea and was treated as a \"group of companies\".193\n\nReply, para. 452.\n\nReply, para. 456.\n\nReply, para. 460.\n\nReply, paras. 460-461.\n\n282.\n\nIn regard to (ii), i.e. jurisdiction over Blocks 1 & 2, the Claimants challenge that the rights over the Blocks expired on 9 December 2011 (or two years later). These rights were terminated by Ministerial Decree on 18 April 2014.194\n\nReply, paras. 457-458.\n\n283.\n\nWith respect to (iii), i.e. jurisdiction over the BOT Act, the Claimants' submission is that the Base Convention qualifies as a BOT agreement.195 In particular, the Base Convention contains provisions dealing with infrastructure projects, such as Articles 10(1), 11, 12, and 16.2.1.196 The fact that the Base Convention does not expressly mention the BOT Act is irrelevant since that Act does not impose any formal requirements. What matters are the actual rights and obligations enshrined in the contract, as illustrated by Article 1.1 of the BOT Act which defines a BOT agreement as \"any operation of financing, construction, operation, maintenance, and potentially transfer of ownership of development infrastructures by the private sector, in all its different variants\".197 Finally, the Base Convention does not only apply to Zogota; Article 10(2) of that Convention addresses infrastructure works related to Blocks 1 & 2.198\n\nMem., paras. 196-212; Reply, paras. 463-464.\n\nReply, para. 464.\n\nReply, para. 465.\n\nReply, para. 466.\n\n**2. Analysis**\n---------------\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal will first set out the legal framework of ICSID jurisdiction (a) and then address the Respondent's objections under the 1995 Mining Code (c), the BOT Act (d) and the Base Convention (e).\n\n**a. Legal framework**\n----------------------\n\n285.\n\nThis arbitration is brought on the basis of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, which provides that: (i) the arbitration must be between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State, (ii) there must be a legal dispute arising directly out of (iii) an investment, and (iv) the Contracting State and the investor must have consented in writing to ICSID arbitration. In addition, of course, the ICSID Convention must have been applicable at the relevant time.\n\n286.\n\nWith respect to (i) above, the Tribunal notes that Guinea signed the ICSID Convention on 27 August 1968, deposited its instrument of ratification on 4 November 1968, and that the ICSID Convention entered into force with respect to Guinea on 4 December 1968. The Tribunal further notes that both BSGR and BSGR Guernsey are companies registered under the laws of Bailiwick of Guernsey, that the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland designated Guernsey as a constituent subdivision pursuant to Article 25(1) and (3) of the ICSID Convention, and that Guernsey approved its consent to ICSID jurisdiction. The Tribunal is thus satisfied that BSGR and BSGR Guernsey are nationals of another Contracting State within the meaning of Article 25(1).\n\n287.\n\nThe Tribunal moreover notes that Guinea has abandoned its jurisdictional objection *ratione personae* pursuant to which BSGR Guinea was not a national of another Contracting State pursuant to Article 25(2)(b) of the Convention and expressly consented to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over BSGR Guinea.199 The Tribunal adds that by signing the Base Convention, which in its Article 38.2 provides for ICSID arbitration as seen above, Guinea has accepted to treat BSGR Guinea - a signatory of that convention - as a foreign national for the purpose of arbitrating disputes under that instrument. Accordingly, the Tribunal is satisfied that BSGR Guinea is to be considered as a \"national of another Contracting State\" pursuant to paragraphs 1 and 2(b) of Article 25 of the Convention.\n\nCM, Annex 1, para. 8.\n\n288.\n\nWith respect to (ii) above, the Respondent does not challenge the Claimants\u2019 assertion that the dispute is legal in nature because it concerns the existence or scope of the Claimants\u2019 legal rights as well as the nature and extent of the relief to be granted to the Claimants, if any. Indeed, the subject matter of the present dispute relates to Guinea\u2019s alleged breaches of the Investment Code, the Mining Code, the BOT Act and the Base Convention, and in particular the alleged illegal and expropriation and/or nationalization of the Claimants\u2019 mining and infrastructure rights without providing prompt, adequate and effective compensation.\n\n289.\n\nWith respect to (iii) above, the Respondent does not object that the dispute arose directly out of the Claimants\u2019 investments in Guinea, including BSGR\u2019s shareholding in BSGR Guernsey and indirect shareholding in BSGR Guinea, as well as the shareholding of BSGR Guernsey in BSGR Guinea.\n\n290.\n\nWith respect to (iv) above, it is undisputed that the ICSID Convention only provides that consent must be given in writing. The basis for the consent which the ICSID Convention requires is to be found in another instrument. Here, the Claimants invoke that the Respondent expressed its consent to arbitrate the present dispute before ICSID through (i) Article 28(2) of the Guinean Investment Code, (ii) Article 184 of the Guinean Mining Code, and (iii) Clause 38(2) of the Base Convention (these provisions are quoted further below). The Claimants further argue that the Tribunal is competent to entertain claims under the BOT Act. Except for the Investment Code and, to a limited extent, for the Base Convention, the Respondent opposes the Claimants\u2019 contentions on various grounds, to which the Tribunal will revert below. At this juncture, the Tribunal is satisfied that there is no objection to its competence over the claims brought by all three Claimants under the Investment Code, Article 28(2) of that Code reading in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"However, disputes between the Guinean government and foreign nationals regarding the application or interpretation of this Code, shall, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, be settled by arbitration conducted:\n\n- in accordance with the provisions of the Convention of 18 March 1985 \"Settlement of investment related disputes between the States and Nationals of other States\" established under the auspices of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, ratified by the Republic of Guinea on November 4, 1986 [...].\"200\n\nInvestment Code of the Republic of Guinea, 30 June 1995, Article 28(2) (Exh. CL-3).\n\n291.\n\nFinally, it is undisputed that international law applies to determine whether the Respondent has consented in writing to ICSID arbitration. As stated in *CSOB v. Slovakia:*\n\n\"The question of whether the parties have effectively expressed their consent to ICSID jurisdiction is not to be answered by reference to national law. It is governed by international law as set out in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\"201\n\n*Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka, A.S. v. The Slovak Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 24 May 1999, para. 35.\n\n292.\n\nIt is well-established that consent is not to be presumed, that it must be established by an express manifestation of intent or impliedly by conduct that demonstrates consent, and that the burden of proving consent is on the party asserting jurisdiction.202\n\n*Garanti Koza LLP v. The Republic of Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/20, Decision on the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent, 3 July 2013, para. 21; *Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award, 22 August 2012, para. 175 (Exh. CL-6).\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal further considers it well-established that legislation expressing consent to ICSID jurisdiction is a unilateral declaration of a State interpreted as such. In the words of the *Tidewater* tribunal, which referred to the case law of the International Court of Justice, \"the declaration must be interpreted in good faith 'as it stands, having regard to the words actually used'; 'in a natural and reasonable way, having due regard to the intention of the State concerned'\".203 In this context, municipal law is relevant, for instance to determine the validity of the instrument at issue and to determine the intention of the State.\n\n*Tidewater Inc & Others v. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/5, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 February 2013, para. 102(5), referring to *Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. case (jurisdiction)*, Judgment of July 22nd, 1952: I.C.J. Reports 1952, p. 104; *Fisheries Jurisdiction (Spain v. Canada)*, Jurisdiction of the Court, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1998, para. 49. See also: *Certain Norwegian Loans*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1957, p. 27; *Aegean Sea Continental Shelf*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1978, para. 69; (\"The Court recalls that, when interpreting a declaration accepting its compulsory jurisdiction, it 'must seek the interpretation which is in harmony with a natural and reasonable way of reading the text, having regard to the intention' of the declaring State [\u2026]. The Court noted in the *Fisheries Jurisdiction* case that it had 'not hesitated to place a certain emphasis on the intention of the depositing State [...]. The Court further observed that '[t]he intention of a reserving State may be deduced not only from the text of the relevant clause, but also from the context in which the clause is to be read, and an examination of evidence regarding the circumstances of its preparation and the purposes intended to be served'\") *Whaling in the Antarctic (Australia v. Japan: New Zealand intervening)*, Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 2014, para. 36.\n\n294.\n\nThe Claimants invoke Article 184 of the 1995 Mining Code, Article 13(2) of the BOT Act and Clause 38(2) of the Base Convention as bases of jurisdiction, all of which are disputed by the Respondent.\n\n295.\n\nArticle 184 of the Mining Code, which is entitled \"Settlement of Disputes\", forms part of Title XV entitled \"Final provisions\", and reads as follows:\n\n\"Disputes between one or several mining investors and the State with regard to the extent of their rights and obligations, the performance or non- performance of their undertakings at the end of their titles, assignment, transfer, or subleasing of their rights arising therefrom may be submitted to amicable settlement procedure.\n\nIf one of the parties feels that amicable procedure has failed, the dispute is brought before either the appropriate Guinean court or international arbitration in accordance with the agreement of March 18 1965 for the settlement of disputes with respect to investments between States and nationals of other States, established under aegis of the Banque Internationale pour la Reconstruction et de D\u00e9veloppement.\n\nIn cases where the Centre International pour le R\u00e8glement des Diff\u00e9rends relatifs aux Investissements (CIRDI) declines jurisdiction over a dispute referred to it, the dispute shall be settled by the arbitration court of the Chambre de Commerce Internationale (CCI) according to its own rules and procedures.\n\nIn any other case disputes arising out of the interpretation and application of this Code are brought before the appropriate Guinean courts.\"\n\n296.\n\nArticle 13.2 of the BOT Act reads as follows:\n\n\"The BOT Agreement may freely determine the bodies and the procedure for settlement of disputes between the State and the investor.\n\nAny institutional arbitration clause may be stipulated, with the State, through this Law, hereby waiving any immunity from jurisdiction.\"\n\n297.\n\nClause 38(2) of the Base Convention reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"The Parties agree to submit to the arbitration of the ICC any dispute arising from or related to this Agreement that has not be [sic] resolved under clause 38.1, using the Arbitration Convention of this institution.\n\nIn addition, the Parties agree to make all requests and submissions to the ICSID or to the International Arbitration Court, depending upon the case, and to undertake any other actions supply all information required to set up arbitration proceedings.\"\n\n**b. Jurisdictional objections under the Mining Code**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n298.\n\nWith respect to the 1995 Mining Code, the Respondent\u2019s main argument is that it did not consent to arbitrate the claims under the 1995 Mining Code (i), and in the alternative that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction does not extend over Blocks 1 & 2 or BSGR (ii).\n\ni. *Objection ratione voluntatis*\n---------------------------------\n\n299.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants raise claims in respect of administrative acts taken by Guinean authorities and that Guinean courts have exclusive jurisdiction over such claims pursuant to Article 171 of the 1995 Mining Code. The Claimants reply that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under Article 184, which provides for ICSID (in the first instance) and ICC (in the second instance) \"fullest jurisdiction\" to arbitrate disputes under the Code. The Guinean courts only have jurisdiction where ICSID and ICC decline jurisdiction, which derives from the last paragraph of Article 184, according to which \"[i]n any other case disputes arising out of the interpretation and application of this Code are brought before the appropriate Guinean Courts\". The Claimants add that the measures at issue here were in any event not issued under the 1995 Code but under the 2011 Code and are therefore not governed by Article 171 of the 1995 Code.\n\n300.\n\nArticle 171 of the 1995 Mining Code, which is entitled \"Disputes\", forms part of Title XIII entitled \"Disputes, offenses and penalties\", and reads as follows:\n\n\"Any dispute arising out of an administrative act issued under this Code falls under the jurisdiction of the Administrative Tribunal. Any other dispute is brought before the appropriate court.\"\n\n301.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants invoke Article 184 of the 1995 Mining Code as basis for the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction over their claims of breaches of that same code.204 It therefore appears inconsistent for them to argue that other provisions of the same code, especially Article 171, are irrelevant to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, because the disputed administrative acts were issued under the later code of 2011. In any event, the mining rights were issued under the 1995 Mining Code and the administrative acts at issue refer to both the 1995 and the 2011 Codes. Accordingly, the Tribunal will assess its jurisdiction pursuant to the 1995 Mining Code.\n\nSee, for instance, Mem., paras. 287-298. The Claimants argued that \"[b]y the filing of its Request for Arbitration, the Claimants each accepted the offer to arbitrate its dispute with Guinea in accordance with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and within the meaning of Article 184 of the [1995] Mining Code\" (Mem., para. 424).\n\n302.\n\nThe Tribunal must first determine the interaction between Articles 171 and 184 of the 1995 Mining Code, which are reproduced above. Article 184 provides that disputes between mining investors and the State can be submitted to international arbitration if they relate to the following subject matters:\n\n\u2022 the \"extent of their [the investors'] rights and obligations\" of mining investors;\n\n\u2022 the \"performance or non-performance of their [the investors'] undertakings at the end of their titles\"; and\n\n\u2022 the \"assignment, transfer, or subleasing of their [the investors'] rights arising therefrom [from the mining titles]\".\n\n303.\n\nThe last paragraph of Article 184 further stipulates that \"[in] any other case disputes arising out of the interpretation and application of this [1995] Code are brought before appropriate Guinean courts\".\n\n304.\n\nBy contrast, Article 171 provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Guinean administrative courts over disputes arising out of administrative acts issued under the Mining Code.\n\n305.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal understands that certain disputes are reserved for the local courts. For instance, only a local court could set aside the revocation of an administrative act such as a mining permit. Other types of disputes can be subjected to international arbitration. These are limitatively listed in Article 184(1). Hence, an arbitral tribunal does not enjoy \"fullest jurisdiction\" under the Mining Code, contrary to the Claimants' assertion. It has jurisdiction to the extent the dispute before it falls within one of the categories enumerated in Article 184(1). For example, the arbitral tribunal could determine the compensation owing as a consequence of an unlawful revocation of a mining title, such a dispute dealing with the rights of mining investors and falling within the scope of the first category setup in Article 184(1).\n\n306.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal cannot follow the Claimants' argument that the Respondent draws an artificial distinction between the existence and the extent of rights and obligations of mining investors. That distinction emerges from the interaction of Articles 184 and 171. More specifically, the existence of mining rights is in principle contingent upon the adoption of an administrative act (e.g. articles 24, 28, 36, 43 and 61 of the Mining Code), whereas the scope of such rights may not necessarily be so.\n\n307.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal must determine whether the measures complained of are within one of those which can be arbitrated under Article 184. In their Memorial, the Claimants impugn a series of actions of Guinea defined as \"the Measures\": (i) the 21 March 2014 recommendation of the Technical Committee to the Strategic Committee;205 (ii) the 2 April 2014 opinion of the Strategic Committee to President Cond\u00e9 and the Minister of Mines and Geology;206 (iii) the 17 April 2014 Presidential Order terminating the Zogota Mining Concession;207 (iv) the 18 April 2014 Ministerial Order terminating the Blocks 1 & 2 Permit;208 (v) the 23 April 2014 Ministerial Order terminating the Base Convention;209 and (vi) the 24 April 2014 notification by the Government of Guinea of the termination of the Base Convention, the Zogota Mining Concession and the Blocks 1 & 2 Permit.210 The Claimants add that these acts \"individually and collectively resulted in the unlawful revocation and/or termination of the Claimants\u2019 mining and infrastructure rights, including (i) the Zogota Mining Concession, (ii) the Blocks 1 and 2 Permit, and (iii) the Base Convention\".211\n\nTechnical Committee's recommendation concerning the titles and mining agreement held by the company BSGR Guinea dated 21 March 2014, p. 32 (Exh. C-64).\n\nSee, Mem., para. 137; CM, para. 676. The Tribunal notes that the Parties have not filed the opinion of the Strategic Committee.\n\nDecree D/2014/098/PRG/SGG of 17 April 2014 (Exh. C-65).\n\nOrder No. A 2014/1204/MMG/SGG of 18 April 2014 (Exh. C-66).\n\nOrder No. A 2014/1206/MMG/SGG of 23 April 2014 (Exh. C-67).\n\nLetter of 24 April 2014 from the Ministry of Mines to VBG-VALE BSGR Guinea (Exh. C-68).\n\nMem., para. 142 (Emphasis in the original).\n\n308.\n\nIt is undisputed that measures identified as items (iii) to (vi) qualify as administrative acts. This is clear from the Claimants\u2019 statement that the \"administrative acts by which BSGR\u2019s mining rights were withdrawn were not issued under the 1995 Mining Code but under the 2011 Mining Code\".212 As for items (i) and (ii) referred to in the foregoing paragraph, it is plain from the submissions that the Claimants only mention these measures in the context of their challenge of the revocation and termination of their mining rights, not to seek independent relief. For this reason, it does not seem necessary to characterize these acts.\n\nReply, para. 456.\n\n309.\n\nAs regards the alleged breaches of the Mining Code, the Claimants argue that \"the Measures\" breached Articles 21, 22, 11, 26, 41 and 43 of the Code.213 Subject to two exceptions discussed below, in the Tribunal's view, all the alleged breaches refer to \"the Measures\" identified above. This becomes apparent from the Claimants' own wording whereby the \"Measures taken by Guinea as described above violate a number of Guinea's obligations under the Mining Code\".214 Thus, the Claimants submit that Article 21 was breached \"by reason of the conduct set out above\" [i.e. \"the Measures\"]; Article 22 was breached \"by withdrawing BSGR's right to export iron ore through Liberia\" and by failing to \"grant and maintain BSGR's [sic] Guinea's mining titles and/or BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea's rights under the Base Convention\"; Article 11 was breached by Guinea's failure to perform its obligations and the termination of the Base Convention; Article 26 was breached because, \"[i]n implementing the Measures\", Guinea failed to \"recognise and/or respect BSGR Guinea's exclusive right to prospect for iron ore and/or its exclusive right to an operating permit or mining concession\"; Article 41 was breached because, \"[b]y implementing the Measures, Guinea failed to recognise and respect BSGR Guinea's exclusive right to carry out all kinds of prospecting and development of deposits of mining substances\"; and Article 43 was breached because Guinea failed to grant a mining concession.\n\nMem., paras. 287-297.\n\nMem., para. 287.\n\n310.\n\nIn other words, these alleged breaches all relate to the revocation and termination of the Claimants' mining rights. As such, they involve administrative acts and do not fall within the categories of subject-matters for which Article 184 contemplates recourse to international arbitration. As a result, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that Guinea did not agree to arbitrate the claim under the Mining Code.\n\n311.\n\nHaving reached this conclusion, the Tribunal can dispense with examining the other objections which the Respondent raised in respect of the Mining Code. Finally, it is noted that the Claimants also contend that Articles 26 and 43 were breached because Guinea failed to respond to the Blocks 1 & 2 Feasibility Study in September 2011. Here again, these claims do not fall under one of the categories enumerated in Article 184, with the result that the preceding conclusion remains unchanged.\n\n**c. Jurisdictional objections under the BOT Act**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n312.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that it did not consent to ICSID jurisdiction under the BOT Act (i) and in the alternative that its jurisdiction does not extend over Blocks 1 & 2 and BSGR (ii).\n\ni. *Objection ratione voluntatis*\n---------------------------------\n\n313.\n\nThe Respondent is of the view that the Base Convention does not qualify as a BOT agreement and that the BOT Act thus does not apply. More specifically, the Base Convention contains none of the characteristics of a BOT agreement:\n\n\u2022 Article 10.1 of the Base Convention only contains a general list of infrastructures, but should also contain technical clauses *(\"cahier des charges)* as required under Article 11 of the BOT Act;\n\n\u2022 The Base Convention does not describe the type of BOT operation mentioned in Article 1.3 to 1.11 of the BOT Act;\n\n\u2022 The Claimants never submitted a detailed financing plan or a technical-economic proposal as required under Article 8.1 and 8.2 of the BOT Act;\n\n\u2022 The Base Convention contains no reference to financing terms as required under Article 12.1 of the BOT Act;\n\n\u2022 The term of the Base Convention is tied to the term of the mining concession, without any reference to the time needed to finance the infrastructures;\n\n\u2022 The fiscal regime in Article 33 of the Base Convention only refers to the 1995 Mining Code, not to the BOT Act.\n\n314.\n\nGuinea adds that the Base Convention itself stipulates that the design, development and management of the railway to Liberia will be subject to a separate agreement. It also notes that the National Assembly ratified the Base Convention without any reference to the BOT Act.\n\n315.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants see in the Base Convention a BOT agreement governed by the BOT Act. The latter explicitly refers to mining infrastructure in Article 1.2 and does not contain any formal requirements, so they say. What matters are the rights and obligations contained in the Base Convention. In this context, the Claimants refer in particular to Articles 10.1, 11, 12 and 16.2.1 of the Base Convention, which they regard as containing \"provisions dealing with each component of an infrastructure project governed by the BOT Act\".215\n\nReply, para. 464.\n\n316.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by noting that the BOT Act contains no expression of consent to arbitrate disputes before an international tribunal. Article 13.2 merely allows settling disputes through institutional arbitration provided that an agreement to arbitrate is concluded in a BOT agreement. In this context, the Tribunal notes that it is undisputed that Clause 38.2 of the Base Convention (quoted above at paragraph 297) contains an offer to arbitrate disputes before ICSID. The question therefore arises whether the Base Convention qualifies as a BOT agreement adopted pursuant to the BOT Act. The Tribunal will start its assessment by setting out key provisions of the BOT Act, followed by relevant provisions of the Base Convention.\n\n317.\n\nArticle 1.1 defines a BOT agreement as follows:\n\n\"Any operation of \"Financing, Construction, Operation, Maintenance, and potentially Transfer of Ownership\" of development infrastructures by the private sector, in all its different variants, as indicated in Article 1.4 below.\"\n\n318.\n\nArticle 1.2 defines \"Private Sector Infrastructure and Development Project\" as:\n\n\"Any Infrastructure and Development project normally financed and operated by the public sector, but which will now be fully or partially undertaken by the private sector, including but not limited to the hydroelectric infrastructures such as dams and plants, mining infrastructures, transport infrastructures such as roads, ports, railways and airports, power installations, telecommunications installations, agricultural infrastructures and developments, public buildings, tourist projects, education and health projects, IT networks and free zones. This type of project must be undertaken under the contractual provisions defined hereunder, and in accordance with any successive modifications approved by the President of the Republic of Guinea.\"\n\n319.\n\nArticles 1.3 to 1.11 define a series of operations, including \"Build-Operate-Transfer\" (BOT) in Article 1.3216 and \"Build-Transfer\" (BT) in Article 1.4.217\n\nArticle 1.3 defines \"Build-Operate-Transfer\" (BOT) as follows: \"An agreement through which an investor takes on the financing and construction of a given infrastructure or development project, and its operation and maintenance. The investor operates the infrastructure over a determined period during which it is authorised to receive fees, charges, and miscellaneous costs from the user under user tariffs not exceeding the levels indicated in its bid or negotiated and included in the contract, to enable the investor to recover its investment and its costs of operation and maintenance of the project, including its profit margin. At the end of the initial predetermined period, which must not exceed the duration defined in Article 12 below, the investor transfers the infrastructure to the State, in its entirety and free of charge\" BSGR Presentation, May 2005 (Exh. CL-2).\n\nArticle 1.4 defines \"Build-and-Transfer\" (BT) as follows: \"An agreement through which an investor takes on the financing and construction of a given infrastructure or development project, and after its completion transfers it to the State, in exchange for reimbursement of the investment cost plus a reasonable profit margin, in accordance with a pre-established financing plan approved by the parties. This type of contract may be applied to any infrastructure construction or development project operation, including structures which, for strategic or security reasons, must be operated directly by the State or any entity designated by it\" BSGR Presentation, May 2005 (Exh. CL-2).\n\n320.\n\nArticle 5.2 provides that an investor may propose a project, provided that he or she submits a preliminary feasibility study and that the project is approved in advance by a decree of the Council of Ministers:\n\n\"Investors may take the initiative to propose a project to the Guinean Government. In this case, the preliminary feasibility study is the responsibility of the investor, and the project shall be the subject of approval in advance by Decree taken in Council of Ministers.\n\nThe details relative to the procedure for approval of projects, the formalities of publication and information, the documentation, and the other aspects concerning the initiative and conducting of projects are also fixed by an Implementing Decree of this Law, taken in Council of Ministers.\"\n\n321.\n\nArticle 7 sets forth a number of guarantees granted by the Guinean State, while Article 9 contains tax and other incentives and Article 10 provides for the stabilization of the tax regime. Article 8 addresses the undertakings of the investor, including a financing plan (Article 8.1) and \"full technical and economical proposal concerning the project subject of the BOT Agreement\" (Article 8.2). Article 8.5 states that the investor \"must comply with the prescriptions contained in the BOT Agreement and in its specifications, as defined in Article 11 below\".\n\n322.\n\nArticle 11 describes the content of a BOT agreement in the following terms:\n\n\"The BOT Agreement entered into between the State and the investor, under penalty of nullity, must contain general clauses that will be defined by a Decree taken in Council of Ministers. The special clauses applicable to each BOT operation, or variant of BOT operations, shall be defined on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\n323.\n\nFinally, Article 12.1 speaks to the duration of a BOT agreement:\n\n\"The duration of the BOT Agreement shall be sufficiently long to enable the investor to recover all the costs of investment, operation and maintenance, the financial costs, and a reasonable rate of profitability. This duration shall vary according to the terms of financing adopted for the needs of each project following the feasibility study.\"\n\n324.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the Base Convention, which was signed on 16 December 2009 and ratified by President S\u00e9kouba Konat\u00e9 on 19 March 2010.218 Its preamble contains various references to the 1995 Mining Code, but none to the BOT Act. Moreover, Clause 1, which is entitled \"Definitions\", defines the term \"Mining Code\", but not the BOT Act. Similarly, the preamble of the Presidential Decree ratifying the Base Convention refers to the 1995 Mining Code and not to the BOT Act.\n\nPresidential Order No. 003/PRG/CNDD/SGG/2010 of 19 March 2010 (Exh. C-16).\n\n325.\n\nThe lack of references to the BOT Act in the Base Convention tends to confirm the Respondent\u2019s position that the Base Convention does not qualify as a BOT agreement. However, the Claimants submit that the Base Convention is a BOT Agreement on the basis of the rights and obligations it contains. While it is true that the Base Convention refers on various occasions to railway infrastructure, including the rebuilding of the Conakry-Kankan railway (Clause 10, 10.1(d) and Clause 12) and the construction of the Zogota-Sanniquellie mining railway (Clause 10.1 and Clause 16.1.1), for the following reasons the Tribunal cannot agree with the Claimants that the Base Convention qualifies as a BOT agreement for the purposes of the BOT Act.\n\n326.\n\nFirst, Clause 1 of the Base Convention defines \"Infrastructures contract\" as \"the agreement between the Government and BSGR regarding the design, development and management of the railway running from Zogota to the Liberian border\", thus showing that the specifics of that infrastructure project are (or were meant to be) set out in a separate agreement (which may or may not qualify as a BOT agreement). Second, always in relation to the Zogota-Sanniquellie railway project, the last paragraph of Clause 16.1.1 specifies that the \"terms for design, financing, construction, operation and maintenance of the railway shall be specified by agreement between the Government and the Company\", thus again showing that a separate agreement would regulate that project. Third, contrary to what the Claimants argue, Article 11 of the BOT Act does contain formal requirements under \"penalty of nullity\" if they are not included. While the Parties have not provided the Tribunal with the Ministerial Decree setting out the \"general clauses\" to be included in a BOT agreement, the Tribunal is of the view that the provisions of the Base Convention do not set out so-called \"special clauses\" required pursuant Articles 8.5 and 11 of the BOT Act. Fourth, the Claimants did not rebut the Respondent\u2019s affirmation that no financing plan or complete technical-economic proposal was submitted as required under Articles 8.1 and 8.2 of the BOT Act. Fifth and finally, as regards the Conakry-Kankan railway project, Clause 12 of the Base Convention also states that a feasibility study would still have to be approved by the Government. The fact that this provision also includes an undertaking by the Guinean Government to grant a full exemption from duties, taxes and fees does not change the Tribunal\u2019s view that this provision does not fulfill the requirements set out in Article 11 of the BOT Act.\n\n327.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the Base Convention does not qualify as a BOT agreement. As a consequence, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims asserted under the BOT Act. Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal need not assess the other objections raised by the Respondent in relation to the BOT Act.\n\nii. *Objections ratione materiae and personae*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n328.\n\nThese objections relate to jurisdiction under the BOT Act over Blocks 1 & 2 and BSGR. As the Tribunal has just concluded that it has no jurisdiction under the BOT Act at all, there is no need to analyze these objections.\n\n**d. Jurisdictional objections under the Base Convention**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n329.\n\nFinally, with respect to the Base Convention, the Respondent argues that the Tribunal's jurisdiction does not extend to Blocks 1 & 2 (i) and BSGR (ii).\n\ni. *Objection ratione materiae*\n-------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nWhile the Respondent accepts that the Tribunal is partly competent to entertain the claims under the Base Convention, it insists that the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction only comprises the Zogota project to the exclusion of Blocks 1 & 2. This is so, according to Guinea, because the title and subject matter of the Base Convention only relates to Zogota and Clause 10.2 of the Base Convention mentioning Blocks 1 & 2 speaks of a \"Phase 2\", which would be defined after the filing of the feasibility study. In addition, the Presidential Decree ratifying the Base Convention only refers to Zogota, not to Blocks 1 & 2. The Claimants rebut the Respondent\u2019s objection stating that \"Article 10(2) of the Base Convention relates to infrastructure works in relation to Blocks 1 and 2\".\n\n331.\n\nArticle 10.2 of the Base Convention reads as follows:\n\n**10.2 Phase II: Blocks 1 and 2 Simandou Kerouane**\n\nAt this stage the Company undertakes to create the following elements:\n\n- Two iron ore mines,\n\n- Industrial facilities and equipment,\n\n- Suitable railway infrastructure required for removing the iron ore.\n\n- A residential area at Kerouane,\n\n- Extension of equipment and installations to the port of Buchanan.\n\nFor Phase II the Company shall present the Government with a feasibility study within 24 months from date of signature of this Agreement.\n\nThe conclusions and terms of this study will facilitate defining the terms for the grant of the Mining Concession between the Parties, the terms of operation and shipping from these two Blocks.\n\n332.\n\nTo the extent that the Base Convention does indeed refer in Clause 10.2 to Blocks 1 & 2, the Tribunal is satisfied that it has jurisdiction to entertain claims relating to Blocks 1 & 2 under the Base Convention. This is in particular so because Clause 38.2 (quoted above at paragraph 297) provides for arbitration relating to \"any dispute arising from or related to this Agreement\", which obviously also includes Clause 10.2. The Respondent\u2019s objection is therefore rejected.\n\nii. *Objection ratione personae*\n--------------------------------\n\n333.\n\nFinally, the Respondent objects that jurisdiction under the Base Convention does not include BSGR, because the latter did not sign that agreement. The Claimants did not specifically reply to this objection, although they did contest a similar objection raised by the Respondent in relation to BSGR\u2019s standing to sue under the Mining Code. In essence, the Claimants argued there that BSGR financed the operation and that Guinea always treated BSGR \"at all times\" as a \"group of companies\".219\n\nReply, para. 461.\n\n334.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Base Convention was concluded between the Republic of Guinea, on the one hand, and BSGR Guinea and BSGR Guernsey, on the other. BSGR is not a party to that instrument. In reliance on the principle of privity of contracts and the separate legal personality of corporate entities, it would seem that BSGR has no rights, including no procedural rights under the Base Convention. To escape this conclusion, the Claimants contend that BSGR was funding its subsidiaries\u2019 operations in Guinea. This may make it an indirect investor, but does not make it a party to the Base Convention. The Claimants further invoke that Guinea treated the BSG companies as a group. This raises the question whether the group of companies doctrine would allow extending the arbitration clause in the Base Convention to BSGR. However, other than asserting that Guinean authorities always treated BSGR as a \"group of companies\", the Claimants have provided no information, let alone evidence, on the applicability of the group of companies doctrine in the present case. Considering that the Claimants bear the burden of showing consent, this would be sufficient ground to deny jurisdiction on this basis. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal has nevertheless reviewed the issue and its review confirms the result reached above.\n\n335.\n\nAssuming that the group of companies doctrine may apply at all here, a question which the Tribunal leaves open, different legal regimes require different degrees of involvement before extending an arbitration clause to a non-signatory. Each of these legal regimes, however, requires some sort of involvement by the non-signatory in the negotiation, conclusion or performance of the agreement containing the arbitration clause. Thus, jurisdiction may extend to a non-signatory if the latter has shown, through its role in the negotiation, conclusion and performance of the contract embodying the arbitration clause, that it was a true party in spite of the fact that it did not formally enter into the contract.220 In the present case, the Claimants have not shown that BSGR had any particular role in the negotiation, conclusion or performance of the Base Convention, which might justify extending jurisdiction to BSGR under the Base Convention.\n\nAs stated in *Getma*: \"[I]l ne suffit pas de constater que les deuxi\u00e8me, troisi\u00e8me et quatri\u00e8me Demanderesses appartiennent toutes au m\u00eame groupe de soci\u00e9t\u00e9s et qu'elles ont des dirigeants communs. Pour appr\u00e9cier si ces trois autres Demanderesses ont bel et bien eu la volont\u00e9 d'\u00eatre li\u00e9es par la Clause compromissoire, il convient d'examiner leur r\u00f4le respectif lors de la n\u00e9gociation, la conclusion et l'ex\u00e9cution de la Convention de concession\" *Getma International, NCT Necotrans, Getma International Investissements & NCT Infrastructure & Logistique v. Guinean Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/29, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 December 2012, para. 153 (Exh. C-239).\n\n336.\n\nFirst, Minister Thiam set up a commission on 1 December 2009 to \"conduct the negotiations\" of the Base Convention. According to the Claimants, Messrs. Avidan and Struik \"led the negotiations on behalf of BSGR\".221 However, except for Mr. Struik, all persons involved in these negotiations were employees of BSGR Guinea.222 At that time, Mr. Avidan was President of BSGR Guinea223 and Mr. Struik was COO of BSGR Guernsey and CEO of BSGR Mining & Metals.224 Significantly, in his capacity of COO of BSGR Guernsey, Mr. Struik reported to the board of BSGR Guernsey that BSGR Guinea was involved in the negotiations and responded to questions raised by the committee.225 There is thus no evidence that Mr. Struik acted on behalf of BSGR during the negotiations of the Base Convention.\n\nMem., paras. 73-74.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, Messrs. Avidan and Struik were assisted by Tania Rakitina (a financial manager working in BSGR Guinea's Conakry office), Mohamed Doumbia (BSGR Guinea's local counsel) and Ibrahima Sory Tour\u00e9 (BSGR Guinea's Director of External Relations). Mem., para. 74.\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 8.\n\nStruik (CWS-2), paras. 6-7.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n337.\n\nSecond, Mr. Struik signed the Base Convention in his capacity as Director of BSGR Guernsey and Mr. Avidan signed it in his capacity as Chief Executive of BSGR Guinea.226 There is thus no indication that BSGR played any role at that specific time.\n\nBase Convention, 16 December 2009, p. 59 (Exh. C-69).\n\n338.\n\nThird, there is no evidence that BSGR played a particular role during the performance of the Base Convention. Whereas the Claimants stated that \"the BSGR group, *and BSGR Guinea in particular,* undertook to invest billions of dollars in *inter alia* the Zogota mine and the Trans-Guinean railway\"227 and that \"BSGR and its joint venture partner submitted a Feasibility Study\",228 the Tribunal notes that the Claimants generally refer to the BSG group of companies when using the term \"BSGR\", at times only referring to BSGR Guinea. Thus, for instance, VGB-Vale BSGR Guinea sent in 2011 the Feasibility Study,229 which was the local vehicle that replaced BSGR Guinea. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants have not provided sufficient evidence to show that BSGR played a significant role in the performance of the Base Convention.\n\nMem., para. 80 (Emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\nMem., para. 100.\n\nLetter from VBG Vale BSGR Guinea to Ministry of Mines dated 14 September 2011 (Exh. C-32).\n\n339.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that BSGR is not a party to the Base Convention or the arbitration clause contained therein.\n\n**e. Conclusion on jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------\n\n340.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction over the three Claimants in respect of claims asserted under the Investment Code. The Tribunal further has jurisdiction over the claims asserted by BSGR Guinea and BSGR Guernsey under the Base Convention, but not over the claims asserted by BSGR under the Base Convention. Finally, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claims brought under the 1995 Mining Code or under the BOT Act.\n\n**C. Claims**\n-------------\n\n**1. Parties' positions on the claims**\n---------------------------------------\n\n**a. Claimants' position**\n--------------------------\n\n341.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the disputed mining rights were revoked unlawfully as a result of a corrupt scheme surrounding President Alpha Cond\u00e9 (section i), and that the circumstances surrounding the revocations breached the Claimants\u2019 rights under the Guinean Investment Code, the 1995 Mining Code, the BOT Act, the Base Convention and international law (section ii).\n\ni. *The Respondent unlawfully revoked the disputed mining rights*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n342.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 main case is that the expropriation of its mining rights was politically motivated and \"part of a massive conspiracy by President Cond\u00e9 to reward the political backers of his 2010 presidential election with highly valuable mining rights\", including and in particular BSGR\u2019s mining rights.230 The Claimants must only establish that Guinea expropriated their rights without compensation,231 not to prove the motives behind the expropriation. Be this as it may, the facts reveal a \"determined campaign of harassment\" to compensate \"outside interests\" that helped President Cond\u00e9 coming to power.232 According to the Claimants, the 2010 presidential election was rigged, which is clear from the fact that candidate Cond\u00e9 only received 18% of the votes in the first round and then 52% in the second round.233\n\nReply, para. 167.

That refusal prompted the illegal mining review procedure designed to strip BSGR of its rights.237\n\nMem., para. 150; Reply, para. 489(i); C-PHB1, paras. 358, 360(ii)-(iii).\n\nMem., para. 151; Reply, para. 489(iii) and Annex 1, para. 150(ii); C-PHB1, para. 360(v).\n\nMem., paras. 108-112; Reply, para. 243, 245-246; C-PHB1, paras. 253, 359.\n\nMem., para. 152.\n\n344.\n\nIn this context, the Claimants point to the role played by Mr. Sammy Mebiame, a \"fixer\" for the Och-Ziff Capital Management hedge fund (\"Och-Ziff\u2019), who pleaded guilty to corruption of Guinean officials, including President Cond\u00e9, and entered into a plea agreement with the US Department of Justice on 9 December 2016.238 The Claimants explain that Mr. Mebiame worked for Palladino Holdings (\"Palladino\"), a company incorporated in Turks & Caicos, and reported to Mr. Walter Hennig, the owner of Palladino. Messrs. Mebiame and Hennig also worked as consultant and director respectively for African Management Limited (\"AML\"), a joint venture between Palladino and Och-Ziff.239 Mr. Mebiame\u2019s job was to \"source and secure mining opportunities in Africa for AML and its portfolio companies\", in particular for African Global Capital I (\"AGC I\") and African Global Capital II (\"AGC II\"), two corporations used for the \"funneling of bribes\" to President Cond\u00e9 and other senior Guinea officials.240\n\nReply, paras. 180-181; C-PHB1, para. 360(ii).\n\nReply, paras. 170-171.\n\nReply, para. 172.\n\n345.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Mr. Mebiame successfully engaged in negotiations with President Cond\u00e9 from June 2010 to June 2012, with the result that he was given the exclusivity over mining opportunities in Guinea,241 was asked to help set up the state owned company SOGUIPAMI,242 and was involved in rewriting the Mining Code. Although the Code provided for the systematic review of all existing mining conventions, in reality it targeted BSGR.243 In the same vein, the \"signatories of the Palladino loan were the same individuals who presided over the Strategic Committee which determined that BSGR\u2019s mining had to be revoked\".244 Messrs. Mebiame and Hennig were also involved in drafting \"the very letters that were sent to existing holders of mining rights by the Government of Guinea telling them there were legal issues with their mining permits\".245 In addition, the Claimants stress that Mr. Mebiame paid substantial sums to gain access to mining rights, including to President Cond\u00e9 and Mr. Yansane Kerfalla, a signatory of the Palladino Agreement and member of the Strategic Committee.246 The bribes included: (i) an S-Class Mercedes Benz offered to President Cond\u00e9 in 2010, (ii) the payment for the rental of a private plane for President Cond\u00e9 on or around 15 March 2011 in an amount of USD 440,000, (iii) cash payments to Mr. Kerfalla between USD 100,000 and USD 200,000 for arranging a secret meeting with heads of SOGUIPAMI, (iv) in kind payments for travel expenses between 2011 and 2012 to Mr. Kerfalla and President Cond\u00e9\u2019s son, Mohammed Alpha Cond\u00e9.247\n\nReply, paras. 194-198.\n\nReply, para. 199.\n\nReply, paras. 202 and 226(v).\n\nReply, para. 203. The Claimants also point to the fact that BSGR and Vale were the only companies that were not invited to the meeting of 17 February 2011 with the Minister of Mines to discuss the amended draft of the Mining Code. See: Reply, para. 204(i), note 193.\n\nReply, para. 206.\n\nReply, paras. 210-213.\n\nReply, para. 212.\n\n346.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that Guinea\u2019s investigation, arrest and detention of BSGR\u2019s employees, Messrs. I.S. Tour\u00e9 and Bangoura, constitute breaches of Guinea\u2019s obligations. The ECOWAS Community Court of Justice recently held Guinea guilty of arbitrary detention and in breach of the right to an effective recourse, principles of adversarial proceedings, equality of arms, and the guarantee to be tried within a reasonable time.248\n\nReply, paras. 229-237.\n\nii. *The Respondent\u2019s measures and conduct breach the Claimants\u2019 rights*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent\u2019s actions breach (i) the Base Convention, (ii) the Investment Code, (iii) the 1995 Mining Code, (iv) the BOT Act, and (v) international law. In essence, the Claimants submit that the revocation of their mining rights constitute an unlawful expropriation and that the review process of its mining rights was unlawful and discriminatory. More specifically, the Claimants allege breaches of the following rules:\n\n\u2022 Articles 4(ii), 7, 8, 14.2(a), 22.1, 29, 31, 32 and 36.2 of the Base Convention.249 These breaches give rise to liability on the part of Guinea \"to each of BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea, including for losses suffered by each of BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea as a result of those breaches\";250\n\n\u2022 Articles 5, 6, and 30 of the Investment Code;251\n\n\u2022 Articles 11, 21, 22, 26, 41 and 43 of the 1995 Mining Code;252 and\n\n\u2022 Articles 7.1, 7.2.2, 7.2.7 and 7.2.12 of the BOT Act.253\n\nMem., paras. 213-234.\n\nMem., para. 235.\n\nMem., paras. 236-286.\n\nMem., paras. 287-298.\n\nMem., paras. 299-309.\n\n348.\n\nFinally, with respect to international law, the Claimants invoke the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law to allege that Guinea's measures breached the obligation not to expropriate, not to adopt arbitrary conduct, to provide full protection and security, to accord fair and equitable treatment, to prevent denial of justice, and not to engage in an abuse of rights.254\n\nMem., paras. 310-313.\n\n**b. Respondent\u2019s position**\n----------------------------\n\n349.\n\nThe Respondent's main defense is that the claims are inadmissible because the mining rights were obtained through corruption. The Parties\u2019 positions on the corruption defense are set out in detail below (VI.C.2).\n\n350.\n\nWith respect to the claims, the Respondent essentially argues that the revocation of the mining rights does not constitute an expropriation (i), that the Claimants were not the subject of discriminatory measures (ii), and that the other allegations are unfounded (iii).\n\ni. *The revocation of the mining rights does not constitute an expropriation*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n351.\n\nGuinea submits that the Strategic Committee revoked the mining rights on the basis of a recommendation of the Technical Committee.255 When reviewing mining titles and conventions, the Technical Committee had indeed come to the conclusion that there was overwhelming evidence that the Claimants' mining rights had been obtained through corruption.256\n\nCM, para. 934.\n\nCM, paras. 939-940, referring to Recommandation concernant les Titres miniers et la Convention mini\u00e8re d\u00e9tenus par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 VBG, 21 mars 2014 (Exh. C-64).\n\n352.\n\nThe Respondent further draws the attention to the fact that BSGR Guinea, which at that time was called VBG-Vale BSGR (Guinea) SARL, participated in the process leading to the issuance of the recommendation of the Technical Committee since it did not challenge the evidence or dispute the existence of corruption.257 For instance, BSGR Guinea never provided any substantial rebuttal to the Allegation Letter, but stated that the corruption allegations targeted events that predated Vale's decision to invest in BSGR Guinea and that any queries should therefore be addressed to BSGR.258 The Technical Committee could not accept such an answer as it considered that the change in the ownership of the holder of the mining rights was irrelevant.259\n\nCM, para. 943.\n\nCM, para. 945, referring to Lettre de M. Ferreira de Rezende (VBG) \u00e0 M. N. Tour\u00e9 (Comit\u00e9 Technique), 28 novembre 2012 (Exh. R-397).\n\nCM, para. 946.\n\n353.\n\nThe Respondent further explains that the Technical Committee forwarded to BSGR Guinea the evidence showing the corruption. However, BSGR Guinea did not comment, be it in writing or at the hearing of 16 December 2013.260 In fact, it maintained the same position throughout the review procedure, arguing that the corruption allegations only concerned BSGR, which suggests that it shared the conclusions of the Technical Committee.261\n\nCM, paras. 948-950.\n\nCM, paras. 952-953.\n\n354.\n\nIn its Final Recommendation, the Technical Committee noted that BSGR Guinea had neither challenged the probity of the review process, nor provided any plausible explanations on the corruption allegations.262\n\nCM, para. 954, referring to Recommandation concernant les Titres miniers et la Convention mini\u00e8re d\u00e9tenus par la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 VBG, 21 mars 2014, paras. 111 and 132 (Exh. C-64).\n\n355.\n\nWith respect to BSGR, which was then the minority shareholder of BSGR Guinea, the Respondent asserts that it provided no proof to rebut the corruption allegations.263 For instance, BSGR merely challenged the authenticity of the contracts without putting forward any evidence in support.264 In addition, although it had the possibility, BSGR chose not to attend the hearing of the Technical Committee held on 16 December 2013.265\n\nCM, para. 956.\n\nCM, para. 960.\n\nCM, para. 963.\n\n356.\n\nFor the Respondent, the review procedure was conducted in accordance with the rules and the parties\u2019 due process rights. Guinea in particular insists that BSGR Guinea never challenged the regularity of the review process at the time,266 and that BSGR\u2019s criticisms are misplaced since the latter had no standing in that process267, but was nevertheless given an opportunity to express its position and decided not to do so.268 On this basis, the Respondent argues that the review procedure and the revocation of the mining rights on the ground of corruption do not constitute an expropriation. Indeed, since the Claimants\u2019 mining rights were null and void, no expropriation could have occurred269 and the revocation was justified by the exercise of Guinea\u2019s police powers.270\n\nCM, paras. 973, 976-984.\n\nCM, paras. 1004-1021.\n\nCM, paras. 985-1003.\n\nCM, para. 1064.\n\nCM, para. 1065.\n\nii. *The Claimants were not the subject of discriminatory measures*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n357.\n\nThe Respondent also rejects the allegation that the Claimants were subject to discriminatory treatment. First, Rio Tinto/Simfer did not escape the review procedure as alleged by the Claimants. In fact, a technical audit was conducted to review the mining rights for these companies\u2019 Blocks 3 and 4.271 Second, the Claimants\u2019 allegations concerning the mining rights of Rusal are only based on rumors found in an isolated press article. In fact, 4 out of the 19 projects that were reviewed concerned Rusal.272 Accordingly, for the Respondent, the Claimants failed to demonstrate any difference of treatment between themselves and other companies which were also subjected to the review procedure.273\n\nCM, para. 1076.\n\nCM, paras. 1077-1080.\n\nCM, para. 1081.\n\niii. *The other allegations are unfounded*\n------------------------------------------\n\n358.\n\nGuinea further submits that the allegations concerning 17 breaches of the investment and mining codes, the BOT Act and the Base Convention are unfounded. First, the Respondent did not breach the national treatment obligation under Article 6(1) of the Investment Code. In particular, the Claimants\u2019 right to export iron ore from Zogota through Liberia was not revoked. The Respondent simply refused to extend that right to the iron ore of Blocks 1 and 2. In any event, Sable Mining never had a right to export ore through Liberia and there can therefore be no breach of national treatment.274 The Respondent also refutes the allegation that it breached Article 30 of the Investment Code, since the Claimants do not establish that any guarantee they had received had been restricted.\n\nCM, para. 1092.\n\n359.\n\nThe Respondent also denies having breached the Mining Code. In particular, the Respondent rejects any allegation of discriminatory treatment.275 Moreover, the Claimants are wrong to invoke Article 11 of the Mining Code, since the Base Convention was not modified, but revoked.276 In the same vein, the exclusive character of the mining rights does not rule out the possibility of a revocation and there is no automaticity in obtaining a mining concession.277\n\nCM, para. 1104.\n\nCM, para. 1105.\n\nCM, para. 1107.\n\n360.\n\nSimilarly, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants did not substantiate any breaches of the BOT Act or the Base Convention. With respect to the BOT Act, the revocation of mining rights for reasons of corruption cannot be assimilated to an anticipated retrocession and there is thus no right to compensation.278 As for the Base Convention, the review procedure did not violate the stabilization clause contained in that agreement\u2019s Article 32.279\n\nCM, para. 1113.\n\nCM, paras. 1117-1119.\n\n361.\n\nFinally, according to Guinea, the Claimants have not proven any breaches of customary international law. Especially, they invoke a \"particularly incomplete and deliberately evasive\" definition of minimum standard of treatment without pointing to any supporting cases.280\n\nCM, para. 1121 (Translated from the French).\n\n**2. Parties' positions on the corruption defense**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent's position**\n----------------------------\n\n362.\n\nThe Respondent raises the defense that the Claimants secured the disputed mining rights by way of corruption and that their claims are consequently either inadmissible or unfounded on the merits.\n\n363.\n\nThe Respondent essentially argues that the Claimants introduced themselves at the highest levels of the State through Ms. Mamadie Tour\u00e9, President Conte\u2019s fourth wife (i), set up a shell company to ensure the opacity of their actions (ii) obtained their mining rights through bribery and influence peddling (iii), bought the silence of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and sought to destroy evidence (iv).\n\ni. *The Claimants obtained access to the highest levels of the State through President Cont\u00e9\u2019s fourth wife*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Respondent explains that BSGR, through its CEO Mr. Oron, started to be interested in the Simandou mining opportunities after Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy contacted Mr. Oron at the end of 2004 or beginning 2005.281 Following that meeting, BSGR set up the company BSGR Guinea BVI in January 2005.282\n\nCM, para. 122. The Respondent explains that Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy had been active in the \"grey market\" since 2004 through their companies FMA International and CW France. CM, para. 119.\n\nCM, para. 123. See: Exh. R-121.\n\n365.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Mr. Cilins developed his network in Guinea by distributing gifts and small sums of money to officials.283 On 14 July 2005, BSGR wrote to Mr. Cilins to express its interest in the Simandou iron ore deposits284 and Mr. Cilins arranged on 20 July 2005 a meeting between Mr. Oron and the Minister of Mines, Mr. Souar\u00e9.285\n\nCM, paras. 124-125.\n\nCM, para. 126.\n\nCM, para. 127.\n\n366.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that, through Mr. Daou, Mr. Cilins met Mr. Bah, a Guinean businessman, who in turn introduced Mr. Cilins to the Minister of Youth and Sports El Hadj Fod\u00e9 Soumah.286 Mr. Soumah then introduced Mr. Cilins to Ms. Tour\u00e9 and to her half brother, Mr. I.S. Tour\u00e9, who would eventually become BSGR Guinea's external relations officer.287 According to Guinea, Mr. Cilins promised money to Ms. Tour\u00e9 and her half-brother in exchange for a private meeting with President Cont\u00e9, which took place at the end of November or the beginning of December 2005 at the Palais des Nations in Conakry.288 During that meeting, which Ms. Tour\u00e9 attended, Mr. Cilins offered a watch worth several thousands of dollars to Pr\u00e9sident Cont\u00e9.289 The latter then called Mr. Souar\u00e9 for him to join the meeting. He understood Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s presence as meaning that *\"BSGR avait tap\u00e9 \u00e0 sa porte et qu\u2019elle avait d\u00e9mand\u00e9 au Pr\u00e9sident de les aider\".290* For the Respondent, Ms. Tour\u00e9 appeared as the \"ideal person\", since her direct intervention secured the award, on 6 February 2006, of seven exploration permits in North Simandou and South Simandou.291\n\nCM, para. 133.\n\nCM, para. 134.

Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy for USD 1,500,295 but Onyx BVI kept Pentler\u2019s assets in trust for these three gentlemen.296 Ms. Merloni-Horemans also signed a document by which Onyx BVI promised Pentler a 17.65% stake in BSGR Guinea BVI on condition of the successful award of mining rights by Guinea.297 Then, on 14 February 2006, Mr. Struik committed that BSGR Guinea BVI would pay to Pentler USD 19,5 million as \"success fees [...] based on the mutually agreed milestones\" for the award of mining rights in Simandou North and South, as well as Blocks 1 & 2.298 The following table depicts these milestones:299\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Milestone | Total Success Fee |\n| Zones North and South | Blocks 1 and 2 |\n| Signing of the MOU and issuing of corresponding prospecting permits | USD500,000 | USD1,500,000 |\n| Completion of a satisfactory feasibility study and registration of \"Companie Miniere de Fer de Simandou | USD500,000 | USD l,000,000 |\n| Signing of Convention de Base\" | USD500,000 | USD1,000,000 |\n| Signing of \"Decret Presidentiel de la Concession\" and issuing of corresponding mining permits | USD1,000,000 | USD1,000,000 |\n| Commercial production and export of first tonne of iron ore product from Simandou | USD2,000,000 | NIL |\n| Commercial production and export of first 10 million tonnes of iron orc product from Simandou | USD4,000,000 | NIL |\n| Repayment of all investments by BSGR (Guinea) Limited | USD6,500,000 | NIL |\n| Total | USD15,000,000 | USD4,500,000 |\n\nCM, paras. 152-153 (Translation by the Tribunal).\n\nCM, para. 154, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 154, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 155, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 156, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 157, referring to [REDACTED] See also: CM, para. 158, graph.\n\nCM, para. 162, referring to [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n368.\n\nThe Respondent emphasises that BSGR\u2019s main objective was to secure mining rights in Blocks 1 & 2. Indeed, Mr. Struik\u2019s letter of 14 February 2006 mentioned above stated that Pentler had \"agreed to continue its efforts to reach an agreement for Blocks 1 and 2 and assist in acquiring these blocks for the Simandou Iron Ore Project and assist in any manner possible with the Simandou Iron Ore Project\".300\n\nCM, para. 164, referring to [REDACTED]\n\n369.\n\nFor the Respondent, the prospect of a 15% share in the mining projects and a remuneration of USD 19,5 million strongly motivated Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy to seek to secure the mining rights although they had no experience in the mining sector.301\n\nCM, para. 165.\n\niii. *The Claimants obtained their mining rights through bribery and influence peddling*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n370.\n\nIn addition to having secured the Simandou North and South exploration permits through Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s influence, the Respondent contends that Pentler was instrumental in putting in place a corrupt scheme by concluding a series of contracts for \"illicit payments\" resulting in BSGR obtaining a pre-emptive right on Blocks 1 to 4, the mining rights of which belonged at that time to Rio Tinto.302 BSGR repeated this scheme to obtain the Blocks 1 & 2 Permit, the Base Convention and the Zogota mining concession.303\n\nCM, para. 167 (Translated from the French).\n\nCM, para. 169.\n\n371.\n\nTurning first to the contracts for illicit payments, Guinea argues that Pentler concluded four contracts on 20 February 2006 to remunerate BSGR's local partners for their assistance in securing mining rights. These include a contract with Messrs. Bah and I.S. Tour\u00e9 (the \"Pentler/Bah/Tour\u00e9 Protocol\"), a contract with Ms. Tour\u00e9 (the \"Pentler/Ms. Tour\u00e9 Protocol of February 2006\"), and two contracts with Mr. Daou (the \"Pentler/Daou Protocols\"). The purpose of the Pentler/Bah/Tour\u00e9 Protocol was to pay Messrs. Bah and I.S. Tour\u00e9 USD 15,652,000 according to agreed milestones for their undefined \"advice, services and assistance\".304 The milestones were specified as follows:305\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Phase** | **Evolution** | **Zones Nord et Sud** | **Blocs 1 et 2** |\n| **1** | Signature du Protocole d'Accord et d\u00e9livrance des Permis de Recherche correspondants | 425.000 USD | 1.200.000 USD |\n| **2** | Etude de Faisabilit\u00e9 et creation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mixte | 400.000 USD | 800.000 USD |\n| **3** | Signature de la Convention de Base pour les zones Nord et Sud et bloes 1 et 2 | 400.000 USD | 800.000 USD |\n| **4** | Signature du D\u00e9cret Pr\u00e9sidentiel de la Concession et d\u00e9livrance des permis correspondants | 800.000 USD | 800.000 USD |\n| **5** | Exportation de la 1er tonne de minerai de fer | 1.600.000 USD |  |\n| **6** | Exportation de 10 millions de minerai de fer | 3.200.000 USD |  |\n| **7** | Retour sur investissement | 5.200.000 USD |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  | **TOTAL** | **12.025.000 USD** | **3.600,000 USD** |\n\nCM, paras. 174-176, referring to [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED] CM, para. 177. In this context, the Respondent highlights the subsequent email exchanges between Mr. Noy and Ms. Merloni-Horemans, where it was agreed to replace the reference to Margali in the Pentler/Bah/Tour\u00e9 Protocol by a reference to Mr. Lev Ran. As a result, Mr. Noy asked that Ms. Merloni-Horemans transmit the necessary powers to Mr. Lev Ran to sign the agreement.\n\n372.\n\nOn the same day, Pentler entered into a second agreement with Ms. Tour\u00e9, who was then 24 years old and had no experience in the mining industry. The effect of this agreement was that Ms. Tour\u00e9 would hold a 5% interest in BSGR\u2019s Simandou project. The agreement contemplated a proposal, which BSGR Guinea BVI would submit to Guinea, to create the \"Compagnie Mini\u00e8re de SIMANDOU\", in which BSGR Guinea BVI would hold a 85% stake and Guinea the remaining 15%. Ms. Tour\u00e9 was to receive an indirect stake of 5% in the mining project through her shareholding in Pentler.306 Since Pentler held 17,65% of BSGR Guinea BVI\u2019s shares (the remaining 82.35% were held by BGSR Steel), and Ms. Tour\u00e9 held a 33,30% share of Pentler, Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s interest in the mining project was set at 5% (85% x 17,65% x 33,3% = 5%).307\n\nCM, para. 184, referring to Protocole Pentler/Tour\u00e9 de 2006, 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 (Exh. R-24).

Indeed, Mr. Lev Ran received from Ms. Merloni-Horemans the power to sign these contracts, with the result that the name of Pentler appears on the contracts, not that of a BSG company.308 As to the role of Ms. Merloni-Horemans, the Respondent states the following:\n\n\"Mme Merloni-Horemans a donc valid\u00e9 deux accords qui pr\u00e9voyaient qu\u2019une partie du capital de BSGR BVI serait utilis\u00e9e pour r\u00e9tribuer les \"services\" de l\u2019\u00e9pouse du Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique et, par ailleurs, que quinze millions de dollars seraient vers\u00e9s \u00e0 un homme d\u2019affaires et \u00e0 un journaliste beau-fr\u00e8re du Pr\u00e9sident Cont\u00e9.\"309\n\nCM, para. 188.\n\nCM, para. 189.\n\n374.\n\nStill on 20 February 2006, so says Guinea, Pentler concluded two other agreements with Mr. Daou.310 Although the Respondent alleges to ignore the role played by Mr. Daou, it points to a letter dated 15 March 2010 showing that Mr. Daou accompanied Mr. Cilins during his initial meetings with Minister Soumah.311 Again, the contracts with Mr. Daou, a businessman with no experience in the mining sector, do not specify the nature of the services at issue. The effect of the first agreement was that Mr. Daou would hold a 2% interest in BSGR\u2019s Simandou project, by receiving a 13.32% shareholding in Pentler.312 The second agreement was of the same content as the Pentler/Bah/Tour\u00e9 Protocol, and provided that Pentler would pay USD 2,975,000 to obtain mining rights in Simandou North and South and USD 900,000 for the rights in Blocks 1 & 2, i.e. in total USD 3,875,000.313\n\n[REDACTED] Protocole Pentler/Daou n\u00b0 2, 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 (Exh.

In other words, Pentler promised to these \"consultants\" the amount that BSGR would pay in installments based on the same milestones.314\n\nCM, para. 199.\n\n376.\n\nThe Respondent further insists that, on that same 20 February 2006, BSGR Guinea BVI and Guinea concluded a Memorandum of Understanding (the \"MoU\", which the Respondent calls the Guinea/BSGR BVI Protocol), granting BSGR Guinea BVI a preemptive right (or right of first refusal) over Blocks 1 to 4.315 According to his testimony, Mr. Souar\u00e9 signed the MoU under pressure of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Mr. I.S. Tour\u00e9.316 The signature of the MoU was followed by an official reception at the Ministry of Mines where BSGR officials offered a miniature car set with diamonds as a gift for Minister Souar\u00e9.317\n\nCM, paras. 201-203.\n\nCM, para. 204, referring to Souar\u00e9 (RWS-2), para. 25.\n\nCM, paras. 206-207.\n\n377.\n\nImmediately following the signature of the MoU, BSGR (through the intermediary of BSGR TS) transferred USD 125,000 to Pentler for its assistance in the signature of the MoU. The Claimants allege that this amount covered direct expenses incurred in connection with the MoU and Mr. Noy mentioned \"direct expenses to obtain the signatures of the M.O.U\".318 However, so states Guinea, the fees of the lawyer assisting the BSG group with the MoU were only USD 8,000.319 Consequently, the amount of USD 125,000 cannot have been spent on direct expenses such as legal fees but must have been used to buy the signatures of the MoU.\n\nCM, para. 213, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 210, referring to [REDACTED]\n\n378.\n\nGuinea stresses that Pentler received its 17,65% shareholding in BSGR Guinea BVI on 10 March 2006,320 and that BSGR repurchased these shares in 2008 for USD 22 million.321 In other words, the shareholders of Pentler, Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy who had bought that company for USD 1,500, collected nearly USD 22 million, while they had provided no services or value but for obtaining the support of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and President Cont\u00e9.322\n\nCM, para. 216, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 217; Rejoinder, para. 153, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 217.\n\n379.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, that corrupt scheme was repeated to obtain the bauxite and uranium permits, the Blocks 1 & 2 permits, the Base Convention and the Zogota mining concession. Specifically, with respect to the 13 bauxite permits, BSGR solicited Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s services and, through Pentler, signed an undated engagement letter confirming that she would have a 5% stake in these permits through her free 33.30% participation in Pentler (see above).323 In addition, BSGR transferred USD 10,000 to Mr. Cilins for the \"payment of the bauxite permits\", it being unclear who benefitted from that amount, the Guinean State not having received it.324 One day after the issuance of the bauxite permits on 9 May 2006, CW France, a company belonging to Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy, sent an invoice of USD 250,000 to BSGR for \"our assistance and consulting for acceptance of bauxite permits in Republic of Guinea\",325 while Ms. Tour\u00e9 (whom Messrs. Struik and Oron call \"the Lady\") inquired whether BSGR was \"happy\".326 Thereafter, Pentler signed a second engagement letter with Ms. Tour\u00e9 confirming her participation in the bauxite project.327\n\nCM, paras. 220-221.\n\nCM, para. 222 (Translated from the French).\n\nCM, para. 224, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 225, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 229, referring to Lettre d'engagement n\u00b0 2 de Pentler envers Mamadie Tour\u00e9, non dat\u00e9e, l\u00e9galis\u00e9e le 21 juillet 2006 (Exh.

Tour\u00e9, was appointed director of external relations of that company.328 After BSGR Guinea obtained four uranium exploration permits on 28 February 2007, BSGR Guinea and Matinda, Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s company, signed an agreement on 20 June 2007 transferring 5% of BSGR Guinea\u2019s shares to Matinda.329 While Mr. Struik now argues that this contract is forged, Ms. Tour\u00e9 attested to its authenticity in her statement before the US authorities.330 The authenticity is corroborated, according to the Respondent, by the fact that the signatures on that contract were legalized on 20 July 2007.331\n\nCM, paras. 237-238.\n\nCM, paras. 241-245, referring to Protocole BSGR Guin\u00e9e/Matinda de 2007, 20 juin 2007 (Exh.

It alleges that BSGR Guinea applied a first time for mining permits over Blocks 1 & 2 in July 2007, but Minister Kant\u00e9 did not follow suit because he was of the view that BSGR Guinea lacked technical capacity to exploit even those mining areas that it had been granted in North Simandou and South Simandou.333 BSGR Guinea then directly approached President Cont\u00e9. On 18 September 2007, Messrs. Avidan and I.S. Tour\u00e9 met the President who called Minister Kant\u00e9. According to Mr. Kant\u00e9, the President gave no specific orders during that meeting. However, after the meeting, Messrs. Avidan and I.S. Tour\u00e9 came to his office and acted as if the President had directed that the transaction be finalized.334 For the Respondent, the email which Mr. Avidan then sent to Messrs. Struik and Steinmetz is revealing:\n\n\"In the next few days I am going to meet some of the key people in the country including the Prime minister, the Lady and maybe the President to push them forward so as to reduce some technical and administrative problems.\"335\n\nCM, para. 248 (Translated from the French).\n\nCM, para. 258, referring to Kant\u00e9 (RWS-4), paras. 16-17.\n\nCM, paras. 260-261, referring to Kant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 28.\n\nCM, para. 267, referring to [REDACTED]\n\n382.\n\nThe Respondent is of the view that this email puts to rest Mr. Avidan's contention that Ms. Tour\u00e9 \"was thought to be a witch and to have magical powers related to voo-doo\", since her services were manifestly useful to \"resolve some technical and administrative problems\".336 Guinea also calls attention to the response provided by Mr. Steinmetz, who was concerned about a \"boomerang effect\" if reference to Rio Tinto was made in written communications:\n\n\"On additional iron ore block, say 1 and 2, I agree that we prepare a very good presentation and show how well we have done and doing etc as you suggested. We should NOT talk about Rio in any written paper, as it is not our problem and government should do their own decision and otherwise it can come back to us as a bomerag!

Ms. Tour\u00e9 was present at both meetings. During the second meeting, so says the Respondent, Prime Minister Kouyat\u00e9 stated that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was President Cont\u00e9's fourth wife and that a \"solution needed to be found to her problem\", which Minister Kant\u00e9 understood as meaning that a solution needed to be found to give Rio Tinto's rights to BSGR.338\n\nCM, para. 273, referring to Kant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 35 (Translated from the French).\n\n384.\n\nAs Minister Kant\u00e9 resisted the requests on the ground that Rio Tinto's concession could only be revoked by Presidential decree, BSGR again approached Ms. Tour\u00e9 and two new contracts were signed with her on 27 and 28 February 2008.339 In the first contract, entitled *\"Contrat de commission\",* BSGR Guinea committed to transfer USD 4 million \"*\u00e0 titre de commission pour l\u2019obtention des blocs 1 et 2 de Simandou\",* of which USD 2 million were for Matinda and the rest for \"*les autres personnes de bonne volont\u00e9 qui auraient contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la facilitation de l\u2019octroi des dits blocs\".*340 In exchange, Matinda committed to *\"faire toutes les d\u00e9marches n\u00e9cessaires pour obtenir des autorit\u00e9s la signature pour l\u2019obtention des dits blocs en faveur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSG RESOURCES GUINEE.*341\n\nRejoinder, para. 245; Kant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 36.\n\nCM, para. 279; Rejoinder, para. 150, referring to Contrat BSGR Guin\u00e9e/Matinda de 2008, 27 f\u00e9vrier 2008 (Exh.

Although Mr. Avidan challenges the authenticity of his signature, and the Claimants argue that these contracts are forged, the Respondent rejects Mr. Avidan\u2019s testimony and the Claimants\u2019 argumentation that these contracts are not authentic.343 If Mr. Avidan was in Israel at that time, he could have signed the contracts there before forwarding them to Ms. Tour\u00e9. The argument that the content of the contracts defies \"common sense\" is unhelpful as there is no room for common sense in illicit contracts. In any event, the BSGR companies performed the contracts, and Ms. Tour\u00e9 received the contractually agreed payments.344 The authenticity is further reinforced when one considers that Mr. Cilins attempted to invite Ms. Tour\u00e9 to destroy these contracts.345\n\nCM, para. 281; Rejoinder, paras. 152, 247.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 248-249.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 249-250.\n\nRejoinder, para. 251.\n\n386.\n\nSince BSGR Guinea had now concluded direct contracts with Ms. Tour\u00e9, the next step in the scheme was to sever BSGR\u2019s ties with Pentler by repurchasing the 17,65% stake of Pentler in BSGR Guinea BVI.346 A share purchase agreement was thus concluded between BSGR Steel and Pentler on 28 March 2008 for a value of USD 22 million.347 Notably, Article 1 of that agreement provided that BSGR Steel would assume the responsibility for all local consultants of Pentler, thus rendering it particularly difficult, according to the Respondent, to argue that BSGR played no role in the corruption scheme.348 In addition to the USD 22 million, Article 5 provided for the payment of USD 8 million in the event that BSGR Steel generated profit exceeding USD 1 billion. In addition, Article 6 stated that Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy would continue to provide consultancy services to BSGR Guinea BVI for five years. On 15 April 2008, BSGR TS proceeded to transfer USD 3 million to Pentler and another million on 16 June 2008.349\n\nCM, para. 283; Rejoinder, para. 153.\n\nCM, paras. 284-287.\n\nCM, paras. 288-289, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, paras. 294-296.\n\n387.\n\nIt is the Respondent\u2019s submission that the BSGR companies were then set on gaining access to Blocks 1 & 2. According to Ms. Tour\u00e9, during a meeting with President Cont\u00e9, Mr. Steinmetz offered money. The President refused, but apparently stated that he entrusted the matter to Ms. Tour\u00e9, meaning that she was the one to receive illegal benefits, in exchange of his support. The Respondent puts it in the following terms:\n\n\"Que cet arrangement soit le fait d\u2019un homme qui, au cr\u00e9puscule de sa vie, se pr\u00e9occupe de sa jeune \u00e9pouse, fille de son ami, ne change rien au fait essentiel : le Pr\u00e9sident Cont\u00e9 a accept\u00e9, en \u00e9change de son soutien, la faveur illicite au b\u00e9n\u00e9fice direct de sa femme \u00e0 qui il confiait \u00ab l\u2019affaire \u00bb.\"350\n\nCM, para. 300.\n\n388.\n\nOn 20 May 2008, Mr. Steinmetz visited Conakry. On the same day, President Cont\u00e9 ended the services of Prime Minister Kouyat\u00e9 and replaced him with the former Minister of Mines Souar\u00e9.351 That move was perceived as favorable to BSGR, since Mr. Kouyat\u00e9 was reluctant to revoke Rio Tinto\u2019s mining rights.352 On 22 May 2008, the Presidency\u2019s Secretary General Mr. Mamady Sam Soumah notified Rio Tinto that its mining rights would be revoked. According to Mr. Souar\u00e9, it was unusual for a Secretary General to intervene in a matter that fell within the competence of the Minister of Mines.353\n\nCM, paras. 304-305.\n\nCM, para. 304, referring to Avidan (CWS-3), para. 128.\n\nCM, para. 307, referring to Souar\u00e9 (RWS-2), paras. 39-40.\n\n389.\n\nOn 28 July 2008, President Cont\u00e9 revoked Rio Tinto\u2019s mining concession over Blocks 1 to 4, with the result that the blocks became \"open\".354 On 5 August 2008, BSGR Guinea applied for mining permits over Blocks 1 to 3, but Minister Kant\u00e9 refused to engage with BSGR since he was of the view that BSGR lacked the financial and technical resources and had failed to prove its capabilities in Simandou North and South.355 Mr. Kant\u00e9 was removed from office and replaced by Minister Nab\u00e9 on 27 August 2008,356 who was then invited to a meeting with President Cont\u00e9 in the presence of Ms. Tour\u00e9 to discuss Simandou.357 According to the Respondent, Mr. Nab\u00e9 felt the pressure exercised by Ms. Tour\u00e9 in favor of BSGR and President Cont\u00e9 became impatient with stripping Rio Tinto of its mining rights and granting them to BSGR.358 Guinea adds that BSGR also obtained the support of the former Minister of Finance Ibrahima Kassory Fofana, who was close to President Cont\u00e9 and who called Minister Nab\u00e9 to urge him to follow the President\u2019s instructions.359 This fact is confirmed by Mr. Thiam, who discussed these details with Mr. Mebiame several years later.360 Thus, the Respondent argues that Minister Nab\u00e9 underwent \"very strong pressure\" by President Cont\u00e9 to strip Rio Tinto of its mining rights and award them to BSGR Guinea.361\n\nCM, paras. 311-313.\n\nCM, paras. 314-315, referring to Kant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 41.\n\nCM, para. 317.\n\nCM, para. 317.\n\nCM, para. 318, referring to Nab\u00e9 (RWS-5), paras. 8-9.\n\nCM, para. 320, referring to Nab\u00e9 (RWS-5), para. 20.\n\nCM, para. 321, referring to Transcript of meeting between Minister of Mines and Sammy Mebiame (the Mebiame tapes), non-dat\u00e9 (Exh.

For this purpose, in the first months of 2009, Mr. Avidan sent a representative to visit Ms. Tour\u00e9 in Freetown, Sierra Leone, where Ms. Tour\u00e9 lived after her husband\u2019s death, to give her USD 50,000 in cash.384 The security director of BSGR Guinea, Mr. Bangoura, also met Ms. Tour\u00e9 in Freetown to advise her of BSGR\u2019s intention to buy back her shares in BSGR Guinea BVI for USD 4 million.385 On 2 August 2009, Ms. Tour\u00e9 signed a declaration or *\"attestation\"* in which she accepted to be paid in four installments of USD 1 million each.386\n\nCM, para. 381, referring to D\u00e9claration de Mme Tour\u00e9, 2 d\u00e9cembre 2013, para. 30 (Exh.

In particular, the Respondent observes that on 8 June 2010 Ms. Tour\u00e9 withdrew from the 2 August 2009 \"agreement\" when she heard that BSGR had cashed USD 2,5 billion for a 51% participation when she had only received USD 4 million for her 5%.399 Thus, ignoring the 2 August 2009 \"agreement\", she requested (i) the performance of the 2008 commission contract between Matinda and BSGR Guinea whereby the latter agreed to pay USD 2 million to the former and (ii) the performance of the 2008 BSGR Guinea/Matinda protocol whereby BSGR Guinea granted Matinda a 5% stake in the Simandou project:\n\n\"En conclusion, la **Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 MATINDA AND CO LIMITED SARL**, ignore totalement l\u2019existence de la fameuse attestation 02 Ao\u00fbt 2009 et s\u2019en tient uniquement au contrat de commission du 27 F\u00e9vrier 2008 et au protocole d\u2019accord du 28 F\u00e9vrier 2008, actes juridiquement valables devant produire pleins et entiers effets entre les parties;\n\nLa **Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 MATINA AND CO LIMITED SARL** exige de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSG Resources Guin\u00e9e, l\u2019ex\u00e9cution correcte, compl\u00e8te et de bonne foi de toutes ses obligations contractuelles n\u00e9es du contrat de commission du 27 F\u00e9vrier 2008 ainsi que du protocole d\u2019accord du 28 F\u00e9vrier *2008.*\"400\n\nCM, paras. 492-493.\n\nCM, para. 493, referring to Exploit d'huissier, 8 juin 2010 (Exh.

In fact, Messrs. Noy and Saada, the Vice Chairman of BSGR\u2019s Sierra Leone subsidiary Octea Ltd, brought her to sign various contracts. The first one, which is undated provides for a payment by Pentler of USD 2,4 million.401 The second one - also undated - foresaw an additional payment by Pentler of USD 3,1 million, on the condition that these agreements remained confidential.402 During a second visit to Freetown on 8 July 2010, Mr. Noy agreed to increase the amounts due to USD 5 million.403\n\nCM, paras. 495-497.\n\nCM, para. 498.\n\nCM, para. 500, referring to Engagement de paiement de Pentler envers Mme Tour\u00e9, 8 juillet 2010 (Exh.

As a result, Ms. Tour\u00e9 transmitted to BSGR Guinea a letter, in which she cancelled her 8 June 2010 withdrawal from the 2 August 2009 contract.404 Thereafter, on 3 August 2010, Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Mr. Noy agreed to a payment schedule, according to which the USD 5 million referred to above would be paid in two equal tranches, the first one 24 months after signature and the second one 24 months thereafter. In addition, they replaced the undated contract which provided for a payment of USD 3,1 million with a new agreement for USD 5,5 million,405 which amount corresponds to (i) the USD 5 million provided in the 8 July and 3 August 2010 agreements and (ii) the amounts transferred to Ms. Tour\u00e9 on 22 and 27 July 2010.406 The Respondent alleges that Ms. Tour\u00e9 also received other payments. For instance, on 5 August 2010, Mr. Cilins gave her a check of USD 50,000 and on 9 August 2010, she received USD 99,970 from Mr. Lev Ran.407\n\nCM, paras. 502-504, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nCM, paras. 506-508.\n\nCM, para. 509.\n\nCM, para. 510.\n\n401.\n\nThere is no doubt in the Respondent\u2019s mind that these payments were made on behalf of BSGR, since on 5 August 2010 Mr. Lev Ran forwarded to BSGR an invoice for USD 3 million, there being no cogent explanation for this invoice. It could not relate to the USD 22 million paid by BSGR to Pentler under the 29 July 2009 contract, as this amount had been settled on 17 May 2010.408 In addition, the Respondent argues that the amount of USD 3 million was transferred to Ms. Tour\u00e9 during 2011, in addition to USD 1,5 million paid by BSGR through Pentler and an intermediary, Mr. Adam Schiffman.409 [REDACTED] Mr. Schiffman was used as intermediary to allow Ms. Tour\u00e9 to acquire real estate in the United States.410 All payments were wired through an account at Wachovia bank under the name of Olympia Title, Inc, a company administered by Mr. Schiffman. On 22 March 2011, through Windpoint, BSGR transferred to Pentler USD 1,5 million and, between March and April 2011, Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy made four transfers in the same total amount on the account of Olympia Title, as follows:\n\n\u2022 On 31 March 2011, Mr. Cilins transferred USD 100,000 from his account at the Leumi bank;\n\n\u2022 On 12 April 2011, Mr. Cilins transferred USD 400,000 from his account at the Leumi bank;\n\n\u2022 On 12 April 2011, Mr. Lev Ran transferred USD 500,000 from his account at the Leumi bank;\n\n\u2022 On 12 April 2011, Mr. Noy transferred USD 500,000 from his account at the Leumi bank.411\n\nCM, paras. 511-513.\n\nCM, paras. 514-515.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nCM, paras. 516-517.\n\n402.\n\nThese amounts were then used by Olympia Title to acquire real estate on behalf of Matinda, Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s company.412 In addition, on 12 September 2011, Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy each transferred the following amounts on the account of Olympia Title:\n\n\u2022 USD 2,211,000 by Mr. Cilins;\n\n\u2022 USD 1,115,000 by Mr. Noy;\n\n\u2022 USD 205,370 by Mr. Lev Ran.\n\nCM, para. 518.\n\n403.\n\nThe Respondent explains that part of these additional payments was transferred by Olympia Title to Ms. Tour\u00e9 in three successive transfers totaling USD 2,163,391.02:\n\n\u2022 USD 150,000 on 11 January 2012;\n\n\u2022 USD 250,000 on 11 January 2012; and\n\n\u2022 USD 936,451.02 on 14 May 2012.\n\n404.\n\nGuinea also highlights that Ms. Tour\u00e9 signed two identical declarations on 27 April and 5 May 2012 attesting to the legality of her \"commercial\" activities in Guinea and denying that on 8 June 2010 she sought to withdraw from the 2 August 2009 contract. As has become apparent from the FBI recordings and the US criminal investigation, Mr. Cilins had prepared these two declarations to protect BSGR and their content is untruthful.413\n\nCM, para. 522.\n\n405.\n\nFinally, the Respondent relies on the FBI investigation, including the recordings of conversations between Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Mr. Cilins at the airport of Jacksonville as well as on Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s declaration before the US authorities, as \"overwhelming evidence\" of a massive corruption scheme put in place by the BSGR companies.414\n\nCM, paras. 566-619.\n\n406.\n\nBetween March and April 2013, Mr. Cilins travelled twice to Florida to meet Ms. Tour\u00e9, who at that time was a cooperating witness in an FBI investigation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and accepted to be wired to record the conversations with Mr. Cilins. According to the Respondent, these recordings provide damning proof of BSGR\u2019s involvement in the corrupt scheme, in particular of the latter\u2019s efforts to obtain the destruction of the evidence linking BSGR to Ms. Tour\u00e9. They also demonstrate how Mr. Cilins sought to buy Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s silence and made her sign a declaration.\n\n407.\n\nMore specifically, Mr. Cilins met Ms. Tour\u00e9 a first time at the Jacksonville airport on 25 March 2013. During that meeting, Mr. Cilins offered to pay USD 1 million for the destruction of the \"papers\", i.e. the corruption contracts, first USD 300,000 and then USD 700,000.415\n\nCM, para. 574.\n\n408.\n\nOn 11 April 2013, Mr. Cilins again met with Ms. Tour\u00e9 at the Jacksonville airport and *insisted on the urgency of the destruction of the contracts:*\n\nIl faut d\u00e9truire \u00e7a, urgent, urgent, urgent.

As a result, they had another meeting on 14 April 2013 again at the airport in Jacksonville.420 Mr. Cilins pressured Ms. Tour\u00e9 anew not to reveal anything to US authorities.

Pollack, Avidan and Steinmetz were aware of Mr. Cilins\u2019 trips to Jacksonville. Their statements that they had no idea that Mr. Cilins would offer money for the destruction of the contracts and for false testimony does not withstand scrutiny. During these meetings, Mr. Cilins said that he was acting on instruction of the \"number 1\" [le *\"num\u00e9ro 1*\"].422 Upon a question from Ms. Tour\u00e9, he specified: *\"Tu sais bien qui.

Tour\u00e9;\n\n\u2022 Accounting and banking information showing cash flows;\n\n\u2022 Internal emails of the Claimants;\n\n\u2022 Correspondence with third parties who took part in the corrupt dealings;\n\n\u2022 Declarations and affidavits of persons involved, such as the declaration of Ms. Tour\u00e9 given to US authorities; and\n\n\u2022 Recordings and videos demonstrating the scheme and the involvement of the protagonists\n\n415.\n\nOn that basis, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal hold the claims inadmissible, or, in the alternative, meritless.\n\n**b. Claimants\u2019 position**\n--------------------------\n\n416.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the disputed mining rights were obtained lawfully (i) and not by way of corruption (ii).\n\ni. *The disputed mining rights were obtained lawfully*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nThe Claimants agree with the Respondent that the issue of corruption is at the heart of the present dispute, around which all other issues revolve: \"The only real issue in this arbitration is whether BSGR acquired its mining rights in Guinea by corruption\".425\n\nReply, para. 4.\n\n418.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 case that they obtained their mining rights \"in accordance with the applicable legislation, by making the appropriate applications that were reviewed by the various relevant and competent authorities and following arms lengths [sic] negotiations with those same authorities\".426\n\nReply, para. 7. See also: Mem., para. 47.\n\n419.\n\nAt the outset and to provide context, the Claimants argue that Rio Tinto obtained its mining rights in Blocks 1 to 4 unlawfully427 and that the withdrawal of those rights in 2008 was lawful.428 This is so, according to the Claimants, because Rio Tinto was bound to retrocede 50% of its mining area following its second permit extension request in 2002,429 as well as a further 50% in 2004,430 and that the 2006 mining concession in Blocks 1 to 4 was \"not lawfully granted\".431 [REDACTED]432 Accordingly, the Claimants argue that the withdrawal of Rio Tinto\u2019s mining rights in July 2008 was proper and that the Claimants\u2019 interest in these areas was legitimate under these circumstances, especially since they applied for vacant mining fields. In particular, the decision of the Council of Ministers of 9 December 2008 to impose the retrocession of 50% of Rio Tinto\u2019s perimeter was proper considering Rio Tinto\u2019s letter of 3 December 2008, where the latter informed Guinea that it would substantially reduce its activities in Guinea,433 as well as the fact that Rio Tinto did not carry out any exploration in Blocks 1 & 2.434 Finally, the Claimants argue that Rio Tinto\u2019s \"repossession\" of the mining rights for the Blocks 3 & 4 was also unlawful, including the attempts to strip the Claimants of their mining rights in Blocks 1 & 2, the failure to remove its equipment from Blocks 1 & 2 and the fact that Rio Tinto paid bribes to reach a settlement agreement with Guinea in 2011.435 This latter fact became public in August 2016 leading to the sacking of the top executives and Rio Tinto\u2019s announcement in October 2016 that it would withdraw from the Simandou project.436\n\nReply, paras. 10-37.\n\nReply, paras. 38-84.\n\nReply, para. 12.\n\nReply, para. 16.\n\nReply, para. 32.\n\nReply, para. 30.

See also: Reply, para. 85.\n\nReply, paras. 121-125.\n\nReply, paras. 126-129.\n\n420.\n\nThe Claimants also submit that they obtained the exploration permits for North Simandou and South Simandou (Zogota) in a lawful manner. They explain that BSGR approached the Guinean authorities, i.e. the Ministry of Mines and the Agency for the Promotion and Development of Mining (\"CPDM\") in November 2005 to negotiate a memorandum of understanding.437 On 1 December 2005, BSGR met with President Cont\u00e9 and the Minister of Mines, Dr. Souar\u00e9, and made a helicopter trip to the Simandou mining area on the next day. Minister Souar\u00e9\u2019s testimony according to which that trip created an incident is incorrect, as he had authorized the trip as the record shows.438\n\nReply, para. 139, referring to Lettre de M.

R-175).\n\n421.\n\nThe Claimants further assert that they provided Minister Souar\u00e9 with a new draft memorandum on 6 January 2006, which contained no reference to Blocks 1 & 2. They are \"uncertain\" how such reference ultimately \"found its way\" in the Memorandum of Understanding (the \"MoU\") which was signed on 20 February 2006.439 Under the MoU, BSGR Guinea BVI committed to carrying out a feasibility study within 30 months of the date of issuance of prospecting permits and Guinea undertook to issue a mining concession six months after the completion of the feasibility study.440 From the Claimants\u2019 perspective, the MoU \"was entirely valid and there was no corruption\", [REDACTED]441\n\nReply, para. 140.

For the Claimants, these rights were granted lawfully as Guinea\u2019s own evidence shows.442\n\nReply, para. 144.\n\n423.\n\nFollowing the incorporation of BSGR Guinea in November 2006,443 initial fieldwork started in South Simandou (Zogota) in 2007 and continued until 2009 with a total of 180 holes and 16,173 meters drilled,444 but exploration work ceased in Simandou North because the drilling results were \"not encouraging\".445\n\nMem., para. 55.\n\nMem., para. 59.\n\nMem., para. 57. The Respondent states in its Reply that the exploration permits for North and South Simandou were renewed on 10 June 2009. See: Reply, para. 146, referring to Decree No. A2009/1327/PR/MMEH/SGG,10 June 2009 (Exh.

This commission, the so-called Base Convention Committee composed of 20 members from various agencies448 - none of which were presented as witnesses by Guinea449 -, ultimately recommended entering into the Base Convention and awarding a mining concession.450 The Base Convention was approved by the Council of Minister and signed on 20 December 2008.451 It entered into force on 19 March 2009 when it was ratified by Presidential Decree.452\n\nReply, para. 146.\n\nReply, para. 147.\n\nReply, para. 148.\n\nReply, para. 149.\n\nReply, para. 156.\n\nReply, para. 161.

Nor is there evidence that Minister Souar\u00e9 put pressure on his colleague Nab\u00e9.462\n\nReply, para. 98.\n\nReply, para. 100.\n\nReply, para. 101.\n\nReply, paras. 101-102.\n\n428.\n\nOn 6 November 2008, BSGR provided the requested \"commitments and warranties\".463 Minister Nab\u00e9 confirmed a few days later on 10 November 2008 that the government considered that BSGR met all the conditions.464 In light of the parallel retrocession of Blocks 1 & 2 by Rio Tinto it was perfectly proper, so say the Claimants, that on 9 December 2008 they were awarded Blocks 1 & 2 on the basis of a CPDM recommendation.465\n\nReply, para. 103.\n\nReply, para. 104, referring to Memo from Minister Nab\u00e9 to Prime Minister Souar\u00e9 dated 10 November 2008 (Exh.

See also: Reply, para. 346.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 40.\n\n434.\n\nFor the Claimants, Guinea should not be allowed to rely on Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s statement before the US authorities. First, that statement is not a witness statement in these present proceedings, where she provided no witness statement. As a result, Ms. Tour\u00e9 was not available for questioning by the Tribunal or cross-examination by the Claimants, which the Claimants view as \"absolutely unacceptable\".485 Even if the statement were considered as a witness statement, it should be disregarded as Ms. Tour\u00e9 was not heard.486 In addition, Ms. Tour\u00e9 has \"never been subject to proper examination\" in the US, Switzerland, Guinea or in the LCIA arbitration, thus depriving the Claimants from the possibility of testing her.487 Finally, the Claimants stress that Guinea has chosen not to prosecute Ms. Tour\u00e9 although she is portrayed as the spider in the web of Guinea\u2019s corruption case.488\n\nReply, paras. 421-422.\n\nReply, para. 423.\n\nReply, para. 424.\n\nReply, para. 425.\n\n435.\n\nThe Claimants furthermore argue that the Tribunal should give \"very little, if any, weight\" to her declaration.489 First, Ms. Tour\u00e9 has been paid by Guinea on at least six occasions a total amount of USD 50,000.490 Second, she was offered US citizenship in exchange for evidence against Messrs. Cilins and Thiam and BSGR.491 Third, while Ms. Tour\u00e9 was forced to forfeit part of her assets, she entered into a deal allowing her to retain half of the value of her real estate in the US.492 Fourth, Ms. Tour\u00e9 repeatedly changed her story; her accounts are inconsistent internally and contradicted by BSGR\u2019s documentary evidence.493\n\nReply, para. 427.\n\nReply, para. 428.\n\nReply, para. 429.\n\nReply, para. 430.\n\nReply, para. 431.\n\n436.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants underline that not a single witness presented by the Respondent \"can attest to Mamadie Tour\u00e9\u2019s alleged receipt of illicit payments\".494 In particular, Messrs. Souar\u00e9 and Nab\u00e9\u2019s \"subjective understanding\" of Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s alleged influence is \"worthless\", especially as they do not say that they were aware that she received payments from BSGR.495 As for Mr. Kant\u00e9\u2019s testimony, it rather reinforces the Claimants\u2019 case that she had \"little influence over President Cont\u00e9\".496\n\nReply, para. 432.\n\nReply, para. 432(i).\n\nReply, para. 432(ii).\n\n437.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimants assert that Ms. Tour\u00e9 had no involvement in the award of the (i) North and South Simandou exploration permits,497 (ii) the Blocks 1 & 2 exploration permits,498 and (iii) the bauxite and uranium permits.499 In addition, the Claimants maintain their position that the contracts with Ms. Tour\u00e9 or Matinda of 20 June 2007, 27 February 2008 and 28 February 2008 are forged.500\n\nReply, Annex 1, paras. 43-46.\n\nReply, Annex 1, paras. 47-48.\n\nReply, Annex 1, paras. 49-55.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 1. The Claimants argue at the outset, the Mr. Avidan's signature on the 27 and 28 February 2008 contracts are clearly forged, since Mr. Avidan was in Israel at the relevant time. The Claimants point to the following elements showing forgery: First, it is \"highly unlikely\" that experienced businessmen as Messrs. Struik or Avidan would commit to illegal agreements \"in writing\". Second, had BSGR had the intention to enter into such contracts in writing, it would not have done so in a \"random fashion\" by signing them on behalf of different entities. Third, the 20 June 2007 contract is \"commercial nonsense\", since it would have been \"ludicrous\" for BSGR to give away 15% of the equity in BSGR Guinea Sarl. Fourth, on Guinea's own case, Ms. Tour\u00e9 already had been promised a shareholding in BSGR, and therefore already had \"plenty of incentive\" to assist BSGR before and there is no reason BSGR would have promised anything more. Fifth, the 28 February 2008 contract did not make any sense since, on Guinea's own case, Matinda already had received a 5% stake in BSGR Guinea through the 20 June 2007 contract. See: Reply, Annex 1, paras. 2-10.\n\n438.\n\nRegarding (i), the Claimants state that the issuance of these permits \"had nothing to do with Ms. Tour\u00e9\".501 These permits were awarded by the CPDM and Minister Souar\u00e9 on the basis of the 1995 Mining Code, and Mr. Souar\u00e9 provided contradictory testimony on the meeting between President Cont\u00e9 and BSGR in December 2005.502 In addition, Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s statement that she called Mr. Souar\u00e9 is unsupported by Mr. Souar\u00e9\u2019s evidence.503\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 43.\n\nReply, paras. 132-134 and Annex 1, paras. 44-45.\n\nReply, para. 143 and Annex 1, para. 45.\n\n439.\n\nWith respect to (ii), the Claimants state that BSGR did not lobby the President, the Ministry of Mines or ask Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s to lobby on its behalf.504 For them, nothing about the process suggests that Ms. Tour\u00e9 intervened or that she was paid for her assistance.505\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 47.\n\nReply, paras. 87-109 and Annex 1, para. 48.\n\n440.\n\nFinally, in connection with (iii), the Respondent\u2019s assertion that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was involved in the issuance of the bauxite and uranium permits is made \"without a scrap of credible evidence\",506 nor is there any evidence that she received any payment in this respect. The email exchange between Mr. Struik and Mr. Oron in May 2006 only mentions that Ms. Tour\u00e9 asked whether BSGR was \"happy\" with the bauxite permits. It does not prove that she had a role obtaining them. Furthermore, nothing supports the suggestion that a portion of the USD 250,000 paid to CW France, a company belonging to Messrs. Cilins, Noy and Lev Ran, was associated to Ms. Tour\u00e9.507 Although Mr. Struik was aware of a \"degree of cajoling\" by Ms. Tour\u00e9, he testified that he obtained all relevant information about the bauxite permits \"directly from the CPDM\".508 The 20 June 2007 contract which provides the only evidence of Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s involvement with respect to the uranium permits is \"clearly forged\".509\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 49.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 55.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 54.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 50.\n\n441.\n\nFinally, the Claimants insist that the Respondent willfully conflates Pentler and BSGR.510 Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Pentler had an \"independent commercial relationship\".511 In support, they enumerate the following elements. First, the Respondent did not provide any evidence that Ms. Tour\u00e9 received two Land Cruisers, let alone from BSGR.512 Second, no part of the USD 250,000 payment to CW France was intended to be passed to Ms. Tour\u00e9.513 Third, BSGR did not give any cash payments to Ms. Tour\u00e9, and the Respondent failed to provide any evidence rebutting Mr. Avidan's statement that he never showed USD 1 million on a bed to Ms. Tour\u00e9 or that he gave her USD 50,000 on a beach near Freetown in Sierra Leone.514 Fourth, contrary to the Respondent's allegation, Mr. Boutros was never used to make payments to Ms. Tour\u00e9. Quite to the contrary, Ms. Tour\u00e9 sought to extort money from BSGR in June 2010; BSGR never saw the contract of 2 August 2009;515 and the 27 February 2008 contract is forged.516 Moreover, BSGR never allowed Mr. Bangoura to promise USD 4 million to Ms. Tour\u00e9,517 and BSGR had a \"legitimate commercial relationship with Mr. Boutros\",518 who received payments as a \"non-employee\" recorded as \"consulting fees, even though the work to which they related had nothing to do with consulting\".519\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 56.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 33.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 58.\n\nReply, Annex 1, paras. 59-60.\n\nReply, Annex 1, paras. 61-62.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 64.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 66.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 65.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 67.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 69.\n\n442.\n\nThe Claimants further allege that Pentler's payments to Ms. Tour\u00e9 in July-August 2010 were not made on behalf of BSGR. Pentler and BSGR are separate entities and BSGR did not control Pentler.520 Pentler's relationship with Ms. Tour\u00e9 had \"nothing to do with BSGR\".521 There is no coincidence in time between Pentler's payments and Ms. Tour\u00e9's withdrawal of her extortion attempts in 2010.522 In fact, she withdrew her claims after I.S. Tour\u00e9 threatened to sue; her withdrawal was \"without any financial incentive at all\".523 Concerning the USD 3 million payment on 5 August 2010, the Claimants explain that it related to the settlement of the share purchase dispute between BSGR and Pentler, which amounted to a total of USD 4,5 million, with the second tranche of USD 1,5 million being paid on 22 March 2011.524 Since Pentler was an offshore company without assets, it is only normal that Pentler paid its creditors when it was in funds. Accordingly, there is nothing suspicious in the fact that \"when BSGR paid Pentler, Pentler paid Mamadie Tour\u00e9\".525 Finally, the Claimants argue that Pentler\u2019s payment to Olympia Title in March-April 2011 and Olympia Title\u2019s payments to Ms. Tour\u00e9 in May 2012 were not made on behalf of BSGR.526 Neither BSGR nor Pentler paid Ms. Tour\u00e9 for obtaining her declaration in May 2012.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 79.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 80.\n\nReply, Annex 1, paras. 80-82.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 83.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 85.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 86.\n\nReply, Annex 1, paras. 87-88.\n\n443.\n\nWith respect to Mr. Cilins, the Claimants point to the fact that seven senior officials, including Messrs. Dor\u00e9, Kant\u00e9, Nab\u00e9, Curtis, Sand\u00e9, Kalil Tour\u00e9 and Bangoura, testified that they never met him.527 In the same vein, not a single witness testified that Messrs. Cilins, Noy or Lev Ran, or their company Pentler intervened in this matter \"on behalf of BSGR\", save for Mr. Souar\u00e9 who does not recall whether he met Mr. Cilins or not.528\n\nReply, para. 347.\n\nReply, para. 348.\n\n444.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that BSGR knew nothing about Pentler\u2019s contracts with Ms. Tour\u00e9, which were not made on BSGR\u2019s behalf.529 Ms. Merloni-Horemans, who was not an employee but an agent of the BSG group, testified that she only temporarily administered Pentler, a dormant shell company initially owned by Onyx, until Mr. Noy provided the details of another administrator in November 2006.530 She only received copies of the contracts \"in her capacity as Pentler\u2019s fiduciary agent\" and did not send them \"to anyone within the BSG group\".531\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 19.\n\nReply, Annex 1, paras. 23-25.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 27.\n\n445.\n\nIn connection with Pentler\u2019s contract with Ms. Tour\u00e9 dated 8 July 2010, the Claimants assert that it is a forgery.532 As regards the 3 August 2010 contract, they contend that it had \"nothing to do with Simandou\" or BSGR, and that it was \"modified\" to refer to Simandou thus \"implicating BSGR\".533 Moreover, in respect of the contracts allegedly concluded between BSGR and Ms. Tour\u00e9/Matinda, the Claimants persist in arguing that they are forged,534 whereas they argue that BSGR \"genuinely\" considered the contracts concluded between Pentler and Ms. Tour\u00e9/Matinda, as forged until Mr. Noy confirmed that they are authentic.535\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 30.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 30.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 31.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 32.\n\n446.\n\nFinally, the Claimants argue that Mr. Cilins\u2019 conviction in 2013 for obstruction of justice in the United States did not implicate BSGR. [REDACTED] that Pentler\u2019s business relations were \"unrelated to BSGR\".536 Concerning his trips to Florida to meet Ms. Tour\u00e9, the Claimants argue that, although BSGR \"knew that he was going to do that\" and that moving her to withdraw her 2010 allegations against BSGR would have been \"very useful\", BSGR had \"no idea\" that Mr. Cilins would offer money to Ms. Tour\u00e9 or ask her to destroy documents.537 For the Claimants, it made no sense to destroy these documents, since there were multiple copies in existence.538 Mr. Steinmetz confirmed that he did not offer money and was unaware that Mr. Cilins would do so, nor did he ask that documents be destroyed.539 In view of the fact that Guinea paid Ms. Tour\u00e9 USD 50,000 and that she was offered US citizenship, she clearly had an incentive to try to involve Mr. Steinmetz by baiting Mr. Cilins to \"pretend\" he had been sent by Mr. Steinmetz. In fact, many people - so say the Claimants - have unduly used Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s name in the hope that it would \"open doors or draw attention\".540 Finally, the Claimants argue that Mr. Cilins\u2019 guilty plea does not implicate BSGR, since he never expressly stated that he acted as an agent of BSGR when he offered money to Ms. Tour\u00e9.541\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 14, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nReply, Annex 1, paras. 12-13.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 14.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 15.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 15.\n\nReply, Annex 1, para. 16.\n\n447.\n\nTurning to the disputed mining rights and starting with the Blocks 1 & 2 Permit, the Claimants argue that, if BSGR had obtained Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s assistance since 2006, as alleged by the Respondent, there is no reason why BSGR was only granted its mining rights in December 2008.542 Various requests were rejected and the mining rights were only granted once BSGR (i) submitted detailed results of its exploration work, as well as (ii) evidence of its technical and financial abilities, (iii) committed to pay a USD 20 million fee and additional development works, and (iv) assumed responsibility for the financial consequences of taking over Rio Tinto\u2019s mining areas.543 For the Claimants, Guinea had an interest in reallocating Blocks 1 & 2 quickly544 and it is telling that the Respondent filed no witness statement from the members of the Council of Ministers that granted the mining rights to the Claimants.545\n\nReply, para. 357.\n\nReply, para. 360.\n\nReply, para. 361.\n\nReply, para. 363.\n\n448.\n\nFurthermore, Guinea\u2019s own witnesses and evidence fail to establish any undue interference. For the Claimants, President Cont\u00e9 was \"genuinely concerned about the mining situation in his country\" and \"frustrated about the general lack of progress and actual commercialisation of the country\u2019s mining resources\".546 Nothing supports the allegation that he ordered to take \"decisions in favor of BSGR\".547 For instance, the then Minister of Mines, Ahmed Kant\u00e9, stated that *\"[t]he President did not give me any instruction\".548* The evidence further shows that the ministers had no difficulty in disagreeing with President Cont\u00e9, as illustrated by Mr. Nab\u00e9\u2019s account that Mr. Souar\u00e9 rejected President Cont\u00e9\u2019s suggestion to step up the Rio Tinto review.549 Finally, the evidence of Mr. Kant\u00e9 and Mr. Kouyat\u00e9 is contradictory and only shows that they are \"telling a tale\" so as to \"stay on the right side of President Conde\u2019s government\".550\n\nReply, para. 365.\n\nReply, para. 365.\n\nReply, para. 366, referring to [REDACTED]\n\nReply, para. 369, referring to Nab\u00e9 (RWS-5), paras. 8-10.\n\nReply, para. 372.\n\n449.\n\nWith respect to the Base Convention, the Claimants state that Guinea \"willfully ignored\" Mr. Thiam\u2019s evidence about the negotiation process of the Base Convention, which was solely the result of \"BSGR\u2019s own hard work and a fair, arm\u2019s length negotiation\".551 The feasibility study for the Zogota project was submitted on 16 December 2009, after two years of exploration work.552 That study was reviewed by a technical department within the Ministry of Mines, after which an Inter-Ministerial Committee was established on 1 December 2009. The Respondent did not allege that BSGR bribed the members of the technical department,553 nor is there any evidence that BSGR bribed the Inter-Ministerial Committee. In this context, the Claimants explain that paying a *per diem* for a total amount of USD 1,000 per member was \"in accordance with standard practice\" and actually requested by Guinea.554 Moreover, the committee challenged the feasibility study and requested further information, which BSGR promptly submitted on 7 December 2009. In any event, the authority to approve the Base Convention befell on the Council of Ministers and the Respondent has not alleged that the members of the Council had been unduly influenced.555\n\nReply, para. 373.\n\nReply, para. 374.\n\nReply, para. 377.\n\nReply, para. 379.\n\nReply, paras. 382-383.\n\n450.\n\nFinally, the Claimants deny having bribed Mr. Thiam.556 There was no special relationship between Mr. Thiam and BSGR.557 The inference that because Mr. Thiam renewed BSGR\u2019s exploration permits for North and South Simandou, he must have been bribed, is simply \"ludicrous\".558 The permits were renewed five months after BSGR\u2019s request, the delay being caused by the referral of the request to the CPDM.559 With respect to Blocks 1 & 2, Mr. Thiam did not display any favoritism towards BSGR and he rigorously investigated Rio Tinto's allegations against BSGR. In addition, his involvement in BSGR's efforts to find a joint venture partner was \"entirely usual and appropriate\".560 Indeed, it was in Guinea's interest that BSGR partnered with a large mining company. In any event, Mr. Thiam did not act for his \"personal benefit\"561 and there is no credible evidence that BSGR rewarded him.562 More specifically, the Claimants state that (i) it was standard practice to pay for travel expenses of ministers \"on certain occasions\",563 (ii) BSGR did not pay USD 23,444.26 for travel costs to Mr. Thiam but to BSGR's travel agent,564 (iii) the informal communications between BSGR and Mr. Thiam are no evidence of corruption,565 (iv) Mr. Thiam's property purchases are linked to his income as banker and unrelated to his activity as minister, not to speak of the fact that the 711 Duell Road property was not bought by Mr. Thiam, but by a friend.566 Finally, the Claimants observe that the recent corruption allegations against Mr. Thiam are linked to a Chinese conglomerate and not to BSGR.567\n\nReply, paras. 387-413.\n\nReply, para. 391.\n\nReply, para. 392.\n\nReply, para. 394.\n\nReply, para. 402.\n\nReply, para. 405.\n\nReply, para. 407.\n\nReply, para. 408(i).\n\nReply, para. 408 (iii).\n\nReply, para. 409.\n\nReply, para. 410.\n\nReply, paras. 441-413.\n\n451.\n\nWith respect to the Zogota mining concession, the Claimants stress that Mr. Sakho, the then Vice-President of the Inter-Ministerial Committee, recommended on 19 December 2009 that the Base Convention be ratified. This was done on 19 March 2010, on the day when the mining concession for Zogota was issued. In any event, the Claimants argue that [t]here is no allegation that BSGR engaged in bribery and corruption\" to procure the mining concession.568\n\nReply, para. 416.\n\n**3. Legal framework applicable to corruption**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n452.\n\nThe Parties fundamentally disagree on most aspects of the legal framework applicable to corruption. They disagree whether only Guinean law applies or whether international law also finds application (a). They further disagree on the scope of Guinean law (b) and international public policy (c) as they relate to corruption. They finally disagree on the burden and the standard of proof (d).\n\n**a. Applicable law under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention**\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n453.\n\nFor the Respondent, both Guinean law and international law govern matters of corruption. Concerning Guinean law, the Respondent asserts that not only criminal law, but also civil and administrative law *(th\u00e9orie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la fraude)* apply.569 In respect of international law, the Respondent argues that international public policy applies since the Tribunal was constituted under an international instrument.570\n\nCM, para. 734; Rejoinder, para. 17; R-PHB1, para. 12.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 12.\n\n454.\n\nAs for the Claimants, in the Request for Arbitration, they argued in general that \"[t]he dispute involves Guinea\u2019s violation of its obligations under Guinean law and international law\".571 However, in the Reply, they submitted that only Guinean law applies to the issue of corruption.572 Even if the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention were to apply, there is no \"secondary role to play for international law\".573 According to the Claimants, \"three fundamental reasons\" justify not applying international law: (i) Guinean law is the \"vehicle of consent\" in this arbitration, not the ICSID Convention; (ii) Guinea chose not to apply international law to issues of corruption, since it only ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption in 2013 and the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption only entered into force in 2012; and (iii) domestic law is to be considered the \"objective law\" in corruption matters.\n\nRfA, para. 93.\n\nReply, para. 273.\n\nReply, para. 274.\n\n455.\n\nArticle 42(1) of the ICSID Convention contains the following choice of law rule:\n\n\"The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable.\"\n\n456.\n\nThe Parties have not agreed on a governing law, with the result that the Tribunal must look to the second sentence of Article 42(1). That sentence provides for the application of Guinean law and \"such rules of international law as may be applicable\". As a result, the Tribunal will primarily apply Guinean law and determine if any rules of international law may govern in addition or in lieu of Guinean law. This determination may imply deciding whether a given legal issue is subject to national or to international law, a question that the ICSID Convention leaves open. Prior decisions have confirmed that it is the Tribunal\u2019s role to proceed to this allocation.574\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, 8 December 2000, p. 911 (Exh RL-62); *Burlington Resources Inc. V. Republic of Ecuador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Liability, 14 December 2012, para. 179 (Exh. CL-22); *Vestey Group Ltd. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/4, Award, 15 April 2016, paras. 116-117.\n\n457.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore first describe the content of Guinean law on corruption and then turn to international law. If necessary, it will then decide which law should prevail.\n\n**b. Guinean law on corruption**\n--------------------------------\n\n458.\n\nThe Respondent views the notion of corruption extensively as encompassing \"three universal elements\", namely \"un paiement ou quelconque avantage\", \"offert \u00e0 un agent public *ou* \u00e0 un tiers dot\u00e9 d\u2019une influence apparente ou r\u00e9elle sur celui-ci\", \"dans l\u2019intention d\u2019obtenir de la part de l\u2019agent public qu\u2019il entreprenne ou s\u2019abstienne d\u2019entreprendre un acte relevant de ses fonctions\".575 It notes that Guinean law, which is inspired by French law, contains rules against corruption pertaining to civil and administrative law576 as well as criminal law.577 For the Respondent, the jurisprudential notion of fraud has been construed extensively to include active trading of influence.578\n\nR-PHB1, para. 27.\n\nCM, paras 735-737; Rejoinder, paras 36-41.\n\nCM, paras 738-739; Rejoinder, paras 42-45.\n\nCM, paras. 736-737.\n\n459.\n\nBy contrast, according to the Claimants, in Articles 192, 194 and 195 of the Criminal Code, Guinean law identifies three criminal offenses in relation to corrupt practices, namely passive corruption, active corruption, and passive trading of influence. The Claimants explain that the offense of active corruption has the following three elements: (i) the promise, offering or giving of offers, promises, gifts or presents; (ii) to a public official; (iii) with the intention of obtaining that the public official acts or refrains from acting. They also stress that the Guinean Criminal Code is \"very narrow and does not, for example, crimilise [sic] active trading of influence\",579 as \"only the solicitation or acceptance of offers and promises is captured by Article 195\". Therefore, in reliance on their legal expert, they argue that active trading of influence \"does not exist under Guinean law\"580 and that \"the promise or offering to a person of an advantage in order that the latter abuses his or her influence, does not trigger any liability\".581\n\nC-PHB1, para. 345; Reply, para. 288.\n\nReply, para. 295; First Expert Report of Pierre-Olivier Sur, para. 29.\n\nReply, para. 295.\n\n460.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that only Guinean criminal law is relevant to its assessment.582 The present proceedings are not aimed at establishing criminal liability, but at determining the admissibility and merits of claims brought forward in arbitration. Therefore, the Tribunal will consider the Guinean legal system in its entirety.\n\nThe Claimants' reliance on *Kim v. Uzbekistan* is misplaced here, since the respondent in that case specifically argued that the claimant's conduct was in breach of a specific provision of the Uzbek criminal code. Here, by contrast, the Respondent does not claim that the Claimants' conduct is in breach of a specific provision of the Guinean Criminal Code, but invokes various legal bases, including administrative and civil law.\n\n461.\n\nIn this context, it is worth starting by noting the preamble of the Constitution of the Republic of Guinea which expressly refers to the fight against corruption:\n\n\"Le peuple de Guin\u00e9e [...] r\u00e9affirme : [...] Sa volont\u00e9 de promouvoir la bonne gouvernance et de lutter r\u00e9solument contre la corruption et les crimes \u00e9conomiques. Ces crimes sont imprescriptibles*.\"583*\n\nConstitution de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e, 7 mai 2010 (Exh. RL-83).\n\n462.\n\nAs for the Guinean Criminal Code, it sanctions three offenses, namely passive corruption, active corruption and passive trading of influence. Specifically, Article 192 of the Criminal Code relates to passive corruption and reads as follows:\n\n\"Sera puni d\u2019un emprisonnement de 1 \u00e0 5 ans et d\u2019une amende double de la valeur des promesses agr\u00e9\u00e9es ou des choses re\u00e7ues ou demand\u00e9es sans que ladite amende puisse \u00eatre inf\u00e9rieure \u00e0 100.000 francs guin\u00e9ens, quiconque aura sollicit\u00e9 ou agr\u00e9\u00e9 des offres ou promesses, sollicit\u00e9 ou re\u00e7u des dons ou pr\u00e9sents pour :\n\n1 - Etant investi d\u2019un mandat \u00e9lectif, fonctionnaire public de l\u2019ordre administratif ou judiciaire, militaire ou assimil\u00e9, agent ou pr\u00e9pos\u00e9 d\u2019une Administration publique ou citoyen charg\u00e9 d\u2019un minist\u00e8re de service public, faire ou s\u2019abstenir de faire un acte de ses fonctions ou de son emploi, juste ou non, mais non sujet \u00e0 salaire [...].\"584\n\nCode p\u00e9nal de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e, Art. 192 (Exh. RL-36).\n\n463.\n\nFurther, Article 194 of the Criminal Code sanctions active corruption in the following terms:\n\n\"Quiconque, pour obtenir, soit l\u2019accomplissement ou l\u2019abstention d\u2019un acte soit une des faveurs ou un des avantages pr\u00e9vus aux articles 192 et 193 aura us\u00e9 de voies de fait ou menaces, de promesses, offres, dons ou pr\u00e9sents ou c\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 des sollicitations tendant \u00e0 la corruption, m\u00eame s\u2019il n\u2019en a pas pris l\u2019initiative sera, que la contrainte ou la corruption ait ou non produit son effet, puni des m\u00eames peines que celles pr\u00e9vues auxdits articles contre la personne corrompue.\"585\n\nCode p\u00e9nal de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e, Art. 194 (Exh. RL-36).\n\n464.\n\nMoreover, Article 195 of the Criminal Code addresses passive trading of influence as follows:\n\n\"Sera puni d\u2019un emprisonnement de 1 \u00e0 5 ans et de l\u2019amende pr\u00e9vue par le premier alin\u00e9a de l\u2019article 192 toute personne qui aura sollicit\u00e9 ou agr\u00e9\u00e9 des offres ou promesses, sollicit\u00e9 ou re\u00e7u des dons ou pr\u00e9sents pour faire obtenir ou tenter de faire obtenir des d\u00e9corations, m\u00e9dailles, distinctions ou r\u00e9compenses, des places, fonctions ou emplois ou des faveurs quelconques accord\u00e9es par l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 publique, des march\u00e9s, entreprises ou autres b\u00e9n\u00e9fices r\u00e9sultant de trait\u00e9s conclus avec l\u2019Autorit\u00e9 publique ou avec l\u2019Administration plac\u00e9e sous le contr\u00f4le de la puissance publique ou, de fa\u00e7on g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, une d\u00e9cision favorable d\u2019une telle Autorit\u00e9 ou Administration et aura ainsi abus\u00e9 d\u2019une influence r\u00e9elle ou suppos\u00e9e.\n\nToutefois, lorsque le coupable est une des personnes vis\u00e9es au paragraphe premier du premier alin\u00e9a de l\u2019article 192 et qu\u2019il a abus\u00e9 de l\u2019influence r\u00e9elle ou suppos\u00e9e que lui donne son mandat ou sa qualit\u00e9, la peine d\u2019emprisonnement sera de 2 \u00e0 10 ans*.*\"586\n\nCode p\u00e9nal de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e, Art. 195 (Exh. RL-36).\n\n465.\n\nThe Respondent also cites to Guinean civil and administrative law prohibiting corruption and trading influence587 and stresses that the Claimants\u2019 expert conceded that reference may be made to French law to ascertain the content of Guinean law.588 Indeed, the Guinean legal system is strongly influenced by French law, including the French notion of fraud. In the absence of Guinean precedents, the Respondent rightly points out that French case law on fraud adopts an expansive notion.589 Fraud is indeed defined as *\"un acte de mauvaise foi, de tromperie, accompli dans le dessein de pr\u00e9judicier \u00e0 [sic] des droits que l\u2019on doit respecter.*590 Active trading of influence, which is the act of buying a third party\u2019s influence over a public official in order to obtain an undue right or advantage, falls within the ambit of such jurisprudential notion of fraud.\n\nCM, paras 735-737; Rejoinder, paras 36-41, referring to H.-B. Pouillaude, L'indemnisation d'un fonctionnaire fautif sanctionn\u00e9 hors d\u00e9lai raisonnable, Actualit\u00e9s juridiques de droit administratif, p. 1642 (Exh.

RL-34).\n\nCM, paras. 736-737.\n\n466.\n\nSimilarly, it is noteworthy that the Cour d\u2019appel of Paris has held that influence peddling is contrary to French international public policy:\n\n\"[u]n contrat ayant pour cause et pour objet l\u2019exercice d\u2019un trafic d\u2019influence par le versement de pots-de-vin est contraire \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public international fran\u00e7ais ainsi qu\u2019\u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9thique des affaires internationales telle que con\u00e7ue par la plus grande partie des \u00c9tats de la communaut\u00e9 internationale.\"591\n\nSoci\u00e9t\u00e9 European Gas Turbines SA c. soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Westman International Ltd, Cour d'appel de Paris (1Ch. C), 30 septembre 1993.\n\n467.\n\nTo conclude, the Tribunal holds that the notion of corruption under Guinean law includes active and passive bribery and trading of influence. It adds that, even if Guinean law were not to prohibit active trading of influence, *quod non,* the Constitution of Guinea provides that international treaties prevail over national law592 and that Guinea is bound by treaties containing said prohibition, as will be seen in the following section.\n\nArticle 151 reads as follows: \"Les trait\u00e9s ou accords r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement approuv\u00e9s ou ratifi\u00e9s ont, d\u00e8s leur publication, une autorit\u00e9 sup\u00e9rieure \u00e0 celle des lois, sous r\u00e9serve de r\u00e9ciprocit\u00e9\". Constitution de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e, 7 mai 2010 (Exh. RL-83).\n\n**c. International law on corruption**\n--------------------------------------\n\n468.\n\nThe Respondent further relies on international law to submit that international public policy bars acts of influence trading. It asserts that the definition of corruption as a matter of international public policy can be elicited from the following international instruments:\n\n\u2022 The OCDE Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions of 17 December 1997;593\n\n\u2022 The Criminal Law Convention on Corruption of the Council of Europe of 27 January 1999;594\n\n\u2022 The Civil Law Convention on Corruption of the Council of Europe of 4 November 1999;595\n\n\u2022 The African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption of 11 July 2003;596\n\n\u2022 The United Nations Convention against Corruption of 31 October 2003;597 and\n\n\u2022 The OECD Recommendation for Further Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions of 26 November 2009.598\n\nConvention de l'OCDE sur la lutte contre la corruption d'agents publics \u00e9trangers dans les transactions commerciales internationales, 17 d\u00e9cembre 1997 (Exh. RL-22).\n\nConvention p\u00e9nale du Conseil de l'Europe sur la corruption, 27 janvier 1999 (Exh. RL-23).\n\nConvention civile du Conseil de l'Europe sur la corruption, 4 novembre 1999 (Exh. RL-24).\n\nConvention de l'Union africaine sur la pr\u00e9vention et la lutte contre la corruption, 12 juillet 2003 (Exh. RL-25).\n\nConvention des Nations Unies contre la corruption, 31 octobre 2003 (Exh. RL-26).\n\nRecommandation de l'OCDE visant \u00e0 renforcer la lutte contre la corruption d'agents publics \u00e9trangers dans les transactions commerciales internationales, 26 novembre 2009 (Exh. RL-27).\n\n469.\n\nThe Respondent also refers to the broad definition of corruption in the ECOWAS Protocol on the Fight against Corruption of 21 December 2001 (the \"ECOWAS Protocol\"), which Guinea ratified on 20 December 2002.\n\n470.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants\u2019 reliance on the award in *Kim v. Uzbekistan* is misplaced since that decision only distinguished between corruption of public officials and corruption in the private sector. While it may be true that international public policy does not extend to corruption in the private sector, so says the Respondent, it does encompass trading of influence to the extent that its aim is to obtain an undue act from a public official.\n\n471.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 position that the Respondent relies on international law because Guinean law does not criminalise active trading of influence. For them, international law has no role to play in a situation where Guinean law exhaustively defines corruption and international public policy lacks the specificity of domestic law. In this context, they rely on *Kim* and in particular on the statement that there is \"no clear consensus that the scope of prohibition on bribery in international public policy at present extends beyond those circumstances that aim at the corruption of government officials\".599\n\nC-PHB2, para. 110(iii), referring to *Valdislav Kim et al. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 March 2017, para. 598 (Exh. CL-60).\n\n472.\n\nIt is undisputed that international law contains a rule prohibiting corruption and bribery and that the international community has adopted a number of instruments to fight corruption.600 Referring more particularity to the African context, corruption is seen as a \"scourge\" which has \"devastating effects on the economic and social development of the African peoples\" and \"undermines accountability and transparency in the management of public affairs as well as socio-economic development on the continent\".601 The fight against corruption has also been a primary focus on the agenda of many national legislatures.602 Because it is universally shared, the prohibition of corruption is deemed a matter of truly international or transnational public policy.603 For instance, in *World Duty Free v. Kenya,* the tribunal stated that \"[i]n light of domestic laws and international conventions relating to corruption, and in light of the decisions taken in this matter by courts and arbitral tribunals, this Tribunal is convinced that bribery is contrary to the international public policy of most, if not all, States or, to use another formula, to transnational public policy\".604\n\nSee, for instance: United Nations Declaration against Corruption and Bribery in International Commercial Transactions, 16 December 1996, 36 *ILM* 1043 (1997); United Nations Convention against Corruption, 31 Octobre 2003, 43 *ILM* 37 (2004) (Exh.

Bangladesh* similarly held that \"[i]t is widely accepted that the prohibition of bribery is of such importance for the international legal order that it forms part of what has been described as international or transnational public policy\".605 It is equally well established that an international tribunal is under a duty to uphold international public policy. As stated, for instance, in *Niko Resources v. Bangladesh,* international investment tribunals should be \"[m]indful of their responsibility for upholding international public policy\".606\n\n*Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v. Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited (\"Bapex\") and Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (\"Petrobangla\")*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 August 2013, paras. 431-433 (Exh. RL-20). See also, for instance, *Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt*, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Award, 8 December 2000, para. 111 (Exh.

Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, para. 292 (Exh. RL-21).\n\n*Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v.

More specifically, they disagree whether the prohibition includes active trading of influence. The content of international public policy in matters of corruption derives from numerous treaties and decisions.\n\n475.\n\nStarting with treaties, Article 4 of the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption adopts an extensive definition of corruption, which includes active and passive trading of influence. Article 4(1)(b) reads as follows:\n\n\"This Convention is applicable to the following acts of corruption and related offences:\n\n[...]\n\n(b) the offering or granting, directly or indirectly, to a public official or any other person, of goods of monetary value, or other benefit, such as a gift, favour, promise or advantage for himself or herself or for another person or entity, in exchange for any act or omission in the performance of his or her public functions.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n476.\n\nArticle 18(a) of the UN Convention against Corruption also addresses the active form of trading of influence in the following terms:\n\n\"Each State Party shall consider adopting such legislative and other measures as may be necessary to establish as criminal offences, when committed intentionally:\n\n(a) The promise, offering or giving to a public official or any other person, directly or indirectly, of an undue advantage in order that the public official or the person abuse his or her real or supposed influence with a view to obtaining from an administration or public authority of the State Party an undue advantage for the original instigator of the act of for any other person.\"607\n\nConvention des Nations Unies contre la corruption, 31 octobre 2003 (Exh. RL-26).\n\n477.\n\nThe fact that this provision is formulated in non-mandatory terms *(shall consider adopting)* is indifferent for present purposes. Indeed, as mentioned above, Guinea had already ratified the ECOWAS Protocol on 20 December 2002, which includes active trading of influence, when the UN Convention against Corruption was concluded in 2003.\n\n478.\n\nArticle 1 of the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions also contains a broad definition of corruption, encompassing influence peddling:\n\n\"Each Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish that it is a criminal offence under its law for any person intentionally to offer, promise or give any undue pecuniary or other advantage, whether directly or through intermediaries, to a foreign public official, for that official or for a third party, in order that the official act or refrain from acting in relation to the performance of official duties, in order to obtain or retain business or other improper advantage in the conduct of international business.\"608\n\nConvention de l'OCDE sur la lutte contre la corruption d'agents publics \u00e9trangers dans les transactions commerciales internationales, 17 d\u00e9cembre 1997 (Exh. RL-22) (Emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n479.\n\nWhile the Claimants have correctly observed that Guinea has not ratified some of these treaties at the relevant times,609 they have not disputed - and rightly so - that Guinea has ratified the ECOWAS Protocol, which ratification predates the Claimants\u2019 investment in Guinea.\n\nFor instance, Guinea ratified the African Union Convention on Preventing and Combating Corruption on 5 March 2012 and the UN Convention Against Corruption on 28 June 2013.\n\n480.\n\nThe preamble of the ECOWAS Protocol states that the signatories are conscious of the \"grave consequences of corruption on investment, economic growth and democracy\" and that \"transparency and good governance strengthen democratic institutions\". Article 6.1 of the ECOWAS Protocol then adopts a broad definition of corruption, which encompasses active and passive bribery and trading of influence. In particular, subparagraph (c) applies to active trading of influence:\n\n\"Any person who promises to offer or to grant directly or indirectly any undue advantage to any person who declares or confirms that he can exercise some influence on decisions or actions of persons occupying positions in the public or private sector, whether or not this influence had been exercised or not, or whether the supposed influence had the desired result or not.\"610\n\nProtocole sur la lutte contre la corruption de la CEDEAO, Art. 6.1(c) (Exh. RL-80).\n\n481.\n\nIn other words, an attempt to exercise influence is sufficient to be captured by the definition of corruption and it is not necessary that the person asserting that he or she can influence a public decision-maker actually exercised his or her influence or achieved the desired result.\n\n482.\n\nIt is true that, following the ratification of the ECOWAS Protocol, Guinea did not amend its Criminal Code to expressly cover active trading of influence. Yet, pursuant to its Article 3, the ECOWAS Protocol applies \"whenever an act of corruption [as defined in Article 6(1)] is committed or produces some effects in a State Party\". On the basis of such clear wording and of Article 151 of the Guinean Constitution which stipulates the prevalence of international over national law, the Tribunal is of the view that the Protocol applies even when a Contracting State has not adopted the \"necessary legislative and other measures to make the acts of corruption enumerated in this Protocol criminal offences\" under Article 6(2) of the Protocol.\n\n483.\n\nTurning second to decisions of arbitral tribunals, one notes that contracts providing for influence trading have been held contrary to international public policy. For instance, an ICC tribunal held:\n\n\"Par ailleurs, une majorit\u00e9 de la doctrine, confort\u00e9e par de nombreuses sentences arbitrales, consid\u00e8re que l\u2019immoralit\u00e9 des pratiques de corruption et de trafic d\u2019influence est fond\u00e9e sur une r\u00e8gle v\u00e9ritablement internationale de telle sorte qu\u2019il n\u2019est pas douteux que celle-ci appartient \u00e0 l\u2019ordre public transnational.\"611\n\nICC case n\u00b0 12990, Final Award, December 2005, para. 189 *in* ICC International Court of Arbitration Bulletin, Vol. 24, Special Supplement, 2013, p. 52. See also: ICC case n\u00b0 13515, Final Award, April 2006 *in* ICC International Court of Arbitration Bulletin, Vol. 24, Special Supplement, 2013, p. 70 (Emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n484.\n\nFurther, a number of tribunals held that the consequence of corruption, including active trading of influence, is that (all or part of the) claims may be deemed inadmissible or denied on the merits if the underlying investment was made through corrupt practices. In *World Duty Free v. Kenya,* the tribunal concluded that \"claims based on contracts of corruption or on contracts obtained by corruption cannot be upheld by this Arbitral Tribunal\".612 In *Niko Resources v. Bangladesh,* the tribunal also held that contracts that are in conflict with international public policy \"cannot be given effect by arbitrators\",613 further adding that various domestic courts and arbitral tribunals \"have found that contracts having influence peddling or bribery as their objectives or motives were void or unenforceable\".614 Other tribunals have shared this conclusion.615\n\n*World Duty Free Company Limited v. Republic of Kenya*, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/7, Award, 4 October 2006, para. 157 (Exh. RL-19).\n\n*Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v. Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited (\"Bapex\") and Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (\"Petrobangla\")*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 August 2013, para. 434 (Exh. RL-20).\n\n*Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. v. Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration & Production Company Limited (\"Bapex\") and Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (\"Petrobangla\")*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11 and ARB/10/18, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 August 2013, para. 436 (Exh. RL-20).\n\nSee, for instance: *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. The Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/03, Award, 4 October 2013, para. 292 (Exh. RL-21); *Churchill Mining and Planet Mining Pty Ltd v. Republic of Indonesia*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40, Award, 6 December 2016, para. 493 (Exh. RL-79) (\"particularly serious cases of fraudulent conduct, such as corruption, have been held to be contrary to international or transnational public policy\").\n\n485.\n\nOn the basis of these authorities, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that international public policy against corruption prohibits, in addition to bribery, both the passive and active forms of trading of influence, to the extent that the latter is exercised to directly or indirectly obtain an undue advantage from a public official. It can be left open whether the relevant legal instruments also target corruption in the private sector as this is not the situation it faces here. It also concludes that conduct irreconcilable with international public policy leads to a finding of inadmissibility of the claims.\n\n486.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal holds that active bribery and active trading of influence aimed at obtaining an undue advantage from a public official are prohibited as a matter of Guinean law and international law. Returning to the issue of the law applicable pursuant to Article 42(1) of tte ICSID Convention, the Tribunal can dispense with deciding which of national or international law should prevail as they both reach the same result. In connection with the legal consequence of a finding of breach, international law, which provides for the inadmissibility of the claims, appears more specific than municipal law. Accordingly, the Tribunal will resort to international law in respect of such legal consequence.\n\n**d. Burden and standard of proof**\n-----------------------------------\n\n487.\n\nStarting with the burden of proof, the Respondent argues that the same general rules apply to instances of corruption as in any other international arbitration.616 For the Respondent, the rule that each party must prove the facts it alleges is a general principle of international law.617 Moreover, without pretending to shift the burden of proof,618 the Respondent argues that the evidence which it brought forward go beyond a *prima facie* demonstration, with the result that the Claimants must now rebut its evidence with precision.619\n\nCM, para. 743.\n\nCM, para. 745.\n\nRejoinder, para. 55.\n\nCM, para. 747.\n\n488.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Guinean law governs the burden of proof and that Guinea has failed to establish \"what the burden of proof is under Guinean law\".620 In the event that the Tribunal were to apply international law to this issue, the Claimants are of the view that each party must prove the facts upon which it relies. They deny that the burden of proof shifts to the other party if the one carrying the burden has only established the facts on a *prima facie* basis.621\n\nReply, para. 301.\n\nReply, paras 304-306.\n\n489.\n\nIn the light of the fact that the claims brought in this arbitration seek to establish the responsibility of a State for breach of the latter's international obligations, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to apply international law to the burden of proof.622 The Parties agree, and rightly so, that each Party carries the burden of proving the facts on which it relies. Indeed, the maxim *actori incumbit probatio,* or the principle that a party has the burden of proving the facts which it alleges, is widely recognized and applied by international courts and tribunals. The International Court of Justice and arbitral tribunals acting under the ICSID Convention have regarded this rule as a general principle of law.623 Since the Respondent is the one alleging acts of corruption, it is also the one carrying the burden of proving such acts. In light of the conclusions that the Tribunal will reach on the evidence in connection with of acts of corruption in the continuation of its analysis, it can dispense with entering into the Parties\u2019 debate about shifting the burden of proof.\n\n*Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, para. 237 (Exh. RL-21).\n\nMilitary and Paramilitary Activities in and against Nicaragua (*Nicaragua v. United States of America*), Jurisdiction and Admissibility, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1984, p. 437, para. 101; Pulp Mills on the River Uruguay (*Argentina v. Uruguay*), Judgment, ICJ Reports 2010, p. 71, para. 162; *Metal-Tech Ltd. v. Republic of Uzbekistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/3, Award, 4 October 2013, para. 237 (Exh. RL-21); *Marvin Feldman v.

Republic of Ecuador*, UNICTRAL, Interim Award, 1 December 2008, para. 138.\n\n490.\n\nA different question is the standard by which proof adduced in accordance with the principle just set out must be measured. For the Respondent, the Tribunal need not apply any standard of proof, since only the arbitrators\u2019 *\"intime conviction\"* matters.624 If the Tribunal were nevertheless minded to apply a standard of proof, such standard should be the one applied in civil law countries, namely \"balance of probabilities\" or \"reasonable certainty\". The cases where tribunals applied a higher standard of proof are isolated and relate to instances where there was no proof at all. In *Kim,* the tribunal held that the standard of proof should be the one of the host State\u2019s law. Since neither Guinean law nor international public policy provide for a standard of proof, it befalls on the Tribunal to exercise its \"pouvoir d\u2019appr\u00e9ciation souveraine\".625\n\nR-PHB1, para. 31. See also: CM, paras. 748-764; Rejoinder, paras. 67-107.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 34.\n\n491.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants submit that, as a \"very serious offense\", corruption requires the application of a heightened standard of proof under both criminal and civil law. They put forward that corruption must be proven with clear and convincing evidence, a standard \"widely applied by international arbitral tribunals\",626 especially where the party making the allegation is itself engaged in the corruption.627 In support, the Claimants point to decisions where tribunals have applied a high standard of proof. *African Holding v. Republic of Congo* referred to the notion of *\"preuve irr\u00e9futable; Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey* held that \"the burden of proof of any allegations of impropriety is particularly heavy\"; *Fraport v. Philippines, EDF v. Romania* and *Siag v. Egypt* made reference to the standard of clear and convincing evidence, the latter observing that \"[i]t is common in most legal systems for serious allegations such as fraud to be held to a high standard of proof\"; and *TSA Spectrum v. Argentine Republic* spoke of \"the most rigorous level of proof\".628\n\nReply, paras. 309, 315.\n\nReply, para. 313.\n\nReply, para. 319.\n\n492.\n\nExcept for the Criminal Code which does not apply here, Guinean law does not prescribe a specific standard of proof in matters of corruption. The Tribunal will thus look to international law and to the practice of international tribunals.\n\n493.\n\nWhile it is clear that the criminal law standard beyond reasonable doubt finds no application in arbitration and that mere allegations and innuendos are no proof,629 there appears to be no settled case law on the standard for proving corruption. Essentially, one can distinguish two groups of cases. A first group applies a heightened standard compared to the measure of proof for facts underlying other claims due to the gravity of a finding of corruption.630 These are the decisions that resort to the common law standard of clear and convincing evidence, or merely state that the \"evidentiary threshold must be high\"631 or that the \"case needs to be clearly made out\".632 A second group is less demanding and applies the same standard like for any other claim. Within this group, one finds the cases which employ the common law standards of balance of probabilities or preponderance of evidence or the civil law standard of *intime conviction du juge.633* Others in this group adopt the standard of reasonable certainty,634 which appears close to *intime conviction.* In addition, some tribunals use a hybrid approach635 or refer to varying formulations, such as for instance evidence having a \"sufficient level of cogency\".636\n\n*Flughafen Z\u00fcrich A.G. y Gesti\u00f3n e Ingenier\u00eda IDC S.A. v.

Guinea*, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/29, Award, 16 August 2016, para. 184 (Exh RL-102). In Kim v. Uzbekistan, the tribunal assessed the impugned conduct against two different standards, i.e. clear and convincing evidence and reasonable certainty. *Valdislav Kim et al. v. Republic of Uzbekistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/13/6, Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 March 2017, para. 614 (Exh.

Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2010-5, Award, 19 September 2013, paras. 4.876, 4.879, 4.931.\n\n494.\n\nBecause corruption is a matter of international public policy and because the activity involving corruption is difficult to prove by nature, the Tribunal deems it reasonable not to resort to a heightened standard. It will thus resort to *intime conviction* or reasonable certainty. In other words, the Tribunal will only make a finding of corruption if, on the basis of the record, it is reasonably certain that acts of corruption have been committed.\n\n495.\n\nIrrespective of the standard of proof, in light of the difficulties inherent in establishing corruption, a number of tribunals have expressed the view, which this Tribunal shares, that corruption may be established through circumstantial evidence. *Methanex v. United States,* for instance, speaks of \"sufficient circumstantial evidence to justify inferring\" the existence of corruption.637\n\n*Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Final Award of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 August 2005, Part III, Chapter B, para. 38. See also: *Metal-Tech Ltd. v.

Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2010-5, Award, 19 September 2013, paras. 4.876.\n\n496.\n\nWhen assessing circumstantial evidence, tribunals are increasingly relying on so-called red flags, i.e. facts which do not prove corruption in and of themselves but signal conduct of potential concern. A combination of facts of the same nature or, in other terms a cumulation of red flags may constitute evidence of corruption. Some tribunals have also referred to this approach as \"connecting the dots\".638\n\nSee, for instance: *Methanex Corporation v. United States of America*, NAFTA/UNCITRAL, Final Award of the Tribunal on Jurisdiction and Merits, 3 August 2005, Part III, Chapter B, para. 3; *ECE Projektmanagement International GmbH, Kommanditgesellschaft Panta Achtundsechzigste Grundst\u00fccksgesellschaft mbG & Co v. Czech Republic*, PCA Case No. 2010-5, Award, 19 September 2013, paras. 4.879.\n\n497.\n\nProfessional and industry associations seeking to fight corruption have drawn up list of red flags. For instance, the International Chamber of Commerce (\"ICC\") issued in 2010 the ICC Guidelines on Agents, Intermediaries and Other Third Parties, identifying the following red flags in connection with intermediaries :639\n\n\"[T]he third party\u2019s flawed background or reputation or the flawed background or reputation of an individual or enterprise represented by the third party;\n\nThe operation takes place in a country known for corrupt payments;\n\nThe third party is suggested by a public official, particularly one with discretionary authority over the business at issue;\n\nThe third party objects to representations regarding compliance with anti-corruption laws or other applicable laws;\n\nThe third party has a close personal or family relationship, or business relationship, with a public official or relative of an official;\n\nThe third party does not reside or have a significant business presence in the country where the customer or project is located;\n\nThe third party is a shell company or has some other non-transparent corporate structure;\n\nThe only qualification the third party brings to the venture is influence over public officials, or the third party claims that he can held secure a contract because he knows the right people;\n\nThe need for the third party arises just before or after a contract is to be awarded;\n\nThe third party requires that his or her identity or, if the third party is an enterprise, the identity of the enterprise\u2019s owners, principals or employees, not be disclosed;\n\nThe third party\u2019s commission or fee seems disproportionate in relation to the services to be rendered;\n\nThe third party requires payment of a commission, or a significant portion thereof, before or immediately upon the award of a contract;\n\nThe third party requests an increase in an agreed commission in order for the third party to \"take care\" of some people or cut some red tape; or\n\nThe third party requests unusual contract terms or payment arrangements that raise local law issues, payments in cash, advance payments, payment in another country's currency, payment to an individual or entity that is not the contracting individual/entity, payment to a numbered bank account or a bank account not held by the contracting individual/entity, or payment into a country that is not the contracting individual/entity's country of registration or the country where the services are performed.\"\n\nICC Guidelines on Agents, Intermediaries and Other Third Parties, 19 November 2010, pp. 5-6 (Exh. RL-51).\n\n498.\n\nIn assessing the facts and the evidence before it, the Tribunal will bear these red flags in mind, knowing that not all of them need to be present for a pattern of corruption to emerge and that some may carry more weight than others. In the end, what will matter is that the Tribunal is convinced or reasonably certain that corruption has occurred on the basis of an overall assessment of the record.\n\n**4. Merits of the Respondent\u2019s allegations of corruption**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Introductory remarks**\n---------------------------\n\n499.\n\nIn this section, the Tribunal will address the Respondent's allegations of corruption. The Respondent submits that the Claimants obtained all of their mining rights through corrupt practices. There is \"overwhelming evidence\", both direct and circumstantial, says the Respondent, that the Claimants put in place a \"fraudulent scheme\". The Respondent points to the following elements:\n\n\u2022 15 *\"pacts of corruption\",* the authenticity of which is now established according to the Respondent, either between BSGR and third parties or between BSGR's intermediary Pentler and third parties, providing for \"substantial remunerations\" for the local intermediaries. Eleven of these pacts were concluded with Ms. Tour\u00e9, the fourth wife of President Cont\u00e9;\n\n\u2022 BSGR's effectively benefitting from the influence of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and President Cont\u00e9 to obtain the mining rights;\n\n\u2022 Evidence that the intermediaries were paid for exerting their influence;\n\n\u2022 BSGR's attempts to dissimulate and destroy evidence of their fraudulous conduct.\n\n500.\n\nThe Claimants essentially respond that there is no evidence that (i) the mining rights were obtained through corruption, (ii) the so-called \"pacts of corruption\" (which qualification is contested by the Claimants) are authentic, (iii) the ministers or President Cont\u00e9 were pressured or influenced by Ms. Tour\u00e9, and (iv) any of the alleged pacts were performed. More specifically, the Claimants contend that there is no evidence that President Cont\u00e9 was bribed. Nor is there evidence that the Claimants bought Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s influence or that she had any influence over President Cont\u00e9 or government officials. There is no evidence either that the Claimants bought the influence of Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s half-brother, Ibrahima Sory Tour\u00e9 (\"IST\") or paid IST to exert influence on the President or other government officials. Finally, there is no evidence that the Claimants bribed any public official to obtain the Base Convention and the mining concession.\n\n501.\n\nThe corruption allegations target two sets of mining permits covering different mining areas: the exploration permits for North and South Simandou, on the one hand, and the mining permits for Blocks 1 & 2, on the other. The Tribunal will address the corruption allegations for these two sets of permits separately. However, before doing so, the Tribunal will address the Claimants\u2019 assertion according to which several documents on record are forged or of doubtful authenticity.\n\n**b. Authenticity of Disputed Documents**\n-----------------------------------------\n\ni. *Introductory considerations*\n--------------------------------\n\n502.\n\nIn their pre-hearing written submissions, the Claimants alleged that certain exhibits which the Respondent invoked to prove corruption were forgeries. Later in the proceedings, at the end of the hearing on preliminary objections and merits, the Claimants raised doubts about the authenticity of additional documents (together the \"Disputed Documents\"). At the end of the hearing, in light of the relevance of the Disputed Documents and their potential impact on the outcome of the dispute, the Tribunal consulted the Parties on the prospect of a forensic inspection to ascertain the authenticity of the documents (\"Document Inspection\").\n\n503.\n\nAfter having heard the Parties, the Tribunal appointed Messrs. Welch and LaPorte as forensic experts on 1 August 2017 (the \"Experts\") and set out the Experts\u2019 Terms of Reference, which the Experts signed on 24 October 2017. The Experts conducted the Document Inspection between 31 October and 3 November 2017 in New York.\n\n504.\n\nIn accordance with the Terms of Reference, the Experts submitted a Preliminary Expert Report (the \"Preliminary Report\") which the Tribunal transmitted to the Parties on 3 January 2018. The Parties commented on the Preliminary Report on 23 January 2018, after which the Experts handed in their final report (the \"Final Report\") on 12 February 2018. The Experts were to be heard on the Report at a hearing starting on 26 March 2018.\n\n505.\n\nOn 12 March 2018, the Claimants applied for the disqualification of the Experts and the exclusion of the Final Report (the \"Disqualification Request\"). They took issue with paragraphs 8 to 12 of the Final Report, which are quoted here in full for a better understanding of what follows:\n\n\"8. As the Tribunal-appointed experts, it is our duty to inform the Tribunal of some concerns that we have with respect to the actions taken by BSGR and the \"BSGR Comments\". Per paragraph 17 of the Terms of Reference (ToR) that was executed on 24 October 2017, Party-appointed experts were permitted to attend the inspection and ask questions at the end of each day. The sessions were cordial and informative. The \"original\" Party-appointed experts for BSGR were present and asked questions that we responded to appropriately. The \"original\" Party-appointed experts appeared to take notes over the course of the fourday inspection and were given the opportunity to observe our testing procedures. Also, we provided over 1100 electronic files, some of which contained additional electronic files, comprising over 10 gigabytes of information and data. However, BSGR has now retained a \"new expert\" that was never designated as a Party-appointed expert. We defer to the Tribunal on whether this is a breach of the Terms of Reference; however, we do have a number of other concerns that the Tribunal should be made aware of, not including whether BSGR breached the Terms of Reference.\n\n9. In our combined 50 years of experience, it appears as though BSGR has engaged in what we commonly refer to in our industry as \"shopping for an expert\". That is, parties are known to seek out an expert to advocate on their behalf. In this case, BSGR's \"original\" Party-appointed experts, Mr. Dennis Ryan and Ms. Laura Mancebo, are both Board Certified through the American Board of Forensic Document Examiners (ABFDE), and therefore have demonstrated that they successfully completed a rigorous training program and whose competency in the forensic document field has been tested. It appears that the \"original\" Party-appointed experts, both of whom are Board Certified, have not issued any comments or findings with respect to their observations of the extensive testing that took place during the inspection phase and presumably reviewing the materials we provided. In some cases, when an expert provides conclusions to a party that do not significantly deviate from an opposing expert and do not support the position of their client then the party may seek out another expert that will support their position. This practice is not entirely uncommon in litigation. However, BSGR has now engaged a \"new expert\" who did not attend the four day inspection and therefore was not given the opportunity to observe all of the testing and ask questions per the ToR, which has now resulted in a number of queries that would not have been necessary had the \"new expert\" been present for the testing.\n\n10. We also have a major concern regarding queries 12 through 14. BSGR explicitly states that C-0112, C-0113 and C-0356 were marked \"Forged\". First, C-0112, C-0113 and C-0356 are not \"Disputed Documents\" and not considered as part of the evidence submitted by the FBI. Second, BSGR appears to have inevitably tainted and biased their \"new expert\" because they are providing biasing information to their expert that some documents were pre-determined to be fraudulent, which to our knowledge have never been forensically examined. Moreover, BSGR and their \"new expert\" suggest that the Tribunal-appointed experts should consider these documents when reaching our conclusions, but they were not identified as Disputed Documents and were not submitted as \"Comparator Documents.\" We have no background information regarding these documents such as who marked them \"forged\", why they were marked \"forged\" and what evidence was present to determine they were \"forged\". Third, the \"new expert\" now suggests that we should consider these documents because they are marked \"forged\". This is highly inappropriate as BSGR has now tainted the \"new expert\" with contextual information that has no foundation*.*\n\n11. We are also concerned that BSGR has not been forthright and did not act in good faith with respect to their request for an extension to respond to the PR on 11 January 2018. As noted in our response on 11 January 2018 regarding BSGR's request, we were diligent in meeting the deadlines that were agreed upon by all parties. We blocked off our schedules in advance and worked through the Holiday season to honor the ToR. Ultimately, we deferred to the discretion of the Tribunal on whether BSGR's request was reasonable and justified given that they should have planned appropriately based on the previously agreed upon timeline. It seems obvious that BSGR made their request for an extension because the \"original experts\" did not dispute the testing we performed or our final conclusions, and then BSGR likely began their search for the \"new expert.\" In our opinion, BSGR did not, in good faith, disclose their reasoning for an extension as it appears they were seeking a \"new expert\" to advocate for them.\n\n12. Also, per paragraph 21 and 22 of the ToR, both Parties were to provide comment; however, BSGR instead has provided sixty-five (65) queries, the majority of which are unnecessary if the PR and the supporting data were reviewed thoroughly. Even more concerning is that posing questions in this manner, some of which are rhetorical and without background or foundation, can create confusion for non-experts. Moreover, unlike the Republic of Guinea, BSGR has not provided any comments with respect to whether their \"new expert\" believes that the Disputed Documents are fraudulent. Nor did they allow their \"original experts\" provide any comments. Although BSGR's response does not provide comments, and instead is designed like a cross examination, we opted to provide a response to each of the sixty-five (65) queries in order to mitigate any confusion regarding our final opinion that there is no evidence to show that the Disputed Documents are fraudulent.\"\n\n506.\n\nA hearing took place as scheduled from 26 to 27 March 2018 in Paris. The purpose was to address the Claimants\u2019 Disqualification Request and the authenticity of the Disputed Documents. During the procedural discussion at the end of the hearing, it was agreed that the Tribunal would decide on the Disqualification Request promptly without reasons and that the reasons would be supplied at a later date. On 4 April 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision to deny the Disqualification Request. Before turning to the authenticity of the Disputed Documents, the Tribunal will now provide the reasons for such denial.\n\nii. *The Claimants\u2019 request to disqualify the Experts and exclude the Final Report*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(a) Parties\u2019 positions\n----------------------\n\n(i) Claimants' position\n-----------------------\n\n507.\n\nThe Claimants submit that the conduct of the Experts has compromised the integrity of the arbitration. In their view, the statements in paragraphs 8 to 12 of the Final Report \"raise justifiable doubts as to [the Experts\u2019] impartiality to serve as tribunal-appointed experts in this matter\".640\n\nProposal to Disqualify the Tribunal-appointed Experts of 12 March 2018, para. 1.\n\n508.\n\nFor the Claimants, Tribunal-appointed Experts must meet the same requirements as arbitrators under Articles 14 and 57 of the ICSID Convention, namely impartiality and independence.641 Like for arbitrators, proof of actual dependence or bias is not required, as it is sufficient to establish the appearance of bias based on objective elements. Moreover, in respect of the request to strike the report from the record, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal has the power to declare evidence inadmissible pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1).\n\nProposal, paras. 27-28 and 30-32.\n\n509.\n\nThe Claimants point to the following accusations proffered by the Experts against BSGR, its counsel and/or its expert: (i) expert shopping, (ii) appointing a non-qualified expert, (iii) raising unnecessary questions, (iv) biasing its expert, (v) failing to act in good faith, (vi) failing to review the Preliminary Report and the supporting data thoroughly, and (vii) creating confusion for non-experts.642 For the Claimants, these accusations are wholly unwarranted.\n\nProposal, para. 21.\n\n510.\n\nFirst, the Claimants deny having engaged in expert shopping. They stress that their first experts stated that they disagreed with the findings in the Preliminary Report.643 They submit that the Experts\u2019 allegations attack the credibility, professionalism and independence of the Claimants\u2019 new expert, Mr. Robert Radley, and create \"in and of themselves a very strong appearance of bias*\".*\n\nProposal, paras. 39-40, refering to Letter of Mr Dennis Ryan to Mishcon de Reya dated 8 March 2018 (Exh. C-376).\n\n511.\n\nSecond, the Claimants assert that Mr. Radley is highly experienced and competent. Courts and tribunals have routinely praised his work and ability to act independently. He adheres to English Court rules on expert evidence and is an active member of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners (\"ASQDE\").\n\n512.\n\nThird, it is the Claimants\u2019 submission that the Experts have no power to assess a Party\u2019s conduct; only the Tribunal has such power. The Experts attacked the Claimants by stating that they did not act in good faith by not disclosing the true reason for seeking an extension to file comments on the Preliminary Report, when the extension request \"was absolutely justified\".644\n\nProposal, paras. 68-69.\n\n513.\n\nFourth, the Claimants contend that the Experts\u2019 statement that they raised unnecessary questions is \"inappropriate\".645 It adds to the appearance of bias, since the Claimants\u2019 comments on the Preliminary Report related to findings made by the Experts after the inspection, and the questions were prepared with the assistance of Mr. Radley.646\n\nProposal, para. 74.\n\nProposal, paras. 74-76.\n\n514.\n\nFifth, the Claimants submit that the Experts raise yet another \"direct and unwarranted attack\" accusing them of biasing their expert.647 This accusation suggests that the Experts did not properly engage with Mr. Radley\u2019s views \"because they considered him to be tainted and biased\".648 Indeed, the Experts only incorporated edits into the Final Report in relation to 5 out of the 65 comments made by the Claimants.649\n\nProposal, para. 79.\n\nProposal, para. 81.\n\nProposal, para. 81.\n\n515.\n\nThese unwarranted accusations must be considered cumulatively, so say the Claimants, as a result of which any fair-minded observer would have reasonable doubts on the impartiality of an expert putting forward such accusations.650\n\nProposal, para. 82.\n\n516.\n\nFinally, the Claimants submit that the inadmissibility of the Final Report \"is the *only* appropriate remedy\".651 For them, the entirety of the Final Report is tainted.652 In this context, the Tribunal should also consider that, if declared admissible, the Final Report may well find its way into a number of parallel proceedings, where BSGR will have no opportunity \"to challenge the Experts or raise its concerns about the impartiality of the Experts\".653\n\nProposal, para. 100 (Emphasis in the original).\n\nProposal, para. 101.\n\nProposal, para. 102.\n\n(ii) Respondent\u2019s position\n--------------------------\n\n517.\n\nFor the Respondent, none of the arguments of the Claimants justifies the challenge of the Experts or the exclusion of the Final Report.654 Therefore, the Respondent asks that the Tribunal deny the Disqualification Request655 It starts by observing that the conclusions of the Final Report fully coincide with other evidence in the record.656 Guinea also stresses that the Claimants did not challenge the Experts\u2019 independence nor the quality of their work during the inspection process.\n\nResponse of the Republic of Guinea to Claimants' Proposal to Disqualify the Tribunal-appointed Experts of 22 March 2018, para. 13.\n\nResponse, para. 143.\n\nResponse, para. 5.\n\n518.\n\nIn terms of applicable standard, the Respondent finds the Claimants\u2019 reliance on Article 57 of the ICSID Convention misplaced, resulting in an \"unjustified amalgam\" between the challenges of arbitrators and of Tribunal-appointed Experts.657 There is a \"fundamental difference\", says the Respondent, between the roles of arbitrators and experts, the former having to decide a dispute whereas the latter only provide evidence.658 Moreover, while the ICSID Convention is silent on the criteria for the disqualification of Tribunal-appointed Experts, Article 6.2 of the IBA Rules on Evidence only refers to the independence and qualifications of an expert. All other considerations, such as impartiality, are only relevant to the Tribunal\u2019s assessment of the evidence provided by the Experts.659\n\nResponse, paras. 43-45; Tr. (DA) (FR), Day 2, 86:3-5 (Jaeger).\n\nResponse, para. 47 (Translated from the French); Tr. (DA) (FR), Day 2, 86:6-11 (Jaeger).\n\nResponse, para. 53.\n\n519.\n\nMoreover, assuming that Article 57 of the ICSID Convention were to apply, the Claimants would have to demonstrate the \"existence of a manifest and clear lack of impartiality, susceptible of convincing, without any in-depth analysis, a reasonable observer, after having heard the Experts\".660\n\nResponse, para. 66 (Translated from the French).\n\n520.\n\nIn addition, Guinea submits that the Claimants fail to establish an \"intelligible standard\" of admissibility of the Final Report and invoke cases that lack pertinence.661 Further, the Respondent notes that the criteria enumerated in Article 9.2 of the IBA Rules on Evidence could serve as a reasonable standard. This provision indeed allows a tribunal to declare only part of an expert opinion inadmissible.662\n\nResponse, paras. 67-68.\n\nResponse, paras. 81-82.\n\n521.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Experts remained within their mandate by alerting the Tribunal to conduct which they deemed improper. Their comments in this respect do not show partiality. First, the Experts made no defamatory statements.663 Their comment on expert shopping only reflected what they were observing.664 Second, in connection with the comment on good faith, the Experts were correct to advise the Tribunal if they considered it their duty. In any event, their concerns proved correct as was demonstrated by the disconnect between the Claimants\u2019 alleged reason for seeking an extension and the intervention of their new expert. Third, the Experts were right to criticize the number and nature of the questions asked by the Claimants about the Preliminary Report; several questions actually concerned documents that were not part of the inspection. Fourth, the Experts\u2019 observations on tainting the expert were justified, as \"[t]he mere reference to documents that were not part of the inspection justified the Experts\u2019 reaction\".665\n\nResponse, para. 93.\n\nResponse, para. 94.\n\nResponse, para. 111 (Translated from the French).\n\n522.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent emphasizes that the Experts made no comment on Mr. Radley\u2019s competence and qualifications.666 The reference to an expert\u2019s accreditation does not evince bias.667 In addition, lauding the Claimants\u2019 first experts does not mean criticizing their second expert.668 In any event, had the Experts considered that Mr. Radley was not qualified, they would not have incorporated comments of his in the Final Report.669\n\nResponse, paras. 114, 116.\n\nResponse, para. 115.\n\nResponse, para. 116.\n\nResponse, para. 118.\n\n523.\n\nFinally, the Respondent underlines that the Claimants did not challenge the scientific work undertaken by the Experts. The Claimants do not allege that the Preliminary Report was tainted by partiality.670 Mr. Radley himself praised the thorough and extensive examination conducted by the Experts.671 Accordingly, it is clear that the alleged partiality did not affect the Experts\u2019 scientific evaluation.672\n\nResponse, para. 124.\n\nResponse, para. 129.\n\nResponse, para. 124.\n\n524.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent submits that the Experts did not falter in their duty to remain impartial. They merely expressed their opinion based on a *prima facie* assessment of facts which they had observed.673 Accordingly, the Final Report is admissible. In any event, if the Tribunal takes issue with paragraphs 8 to 12 of the Final Report, it should disregard these passages and rely on the remainder of the report.674\n\nResponse, para. 134.\n\nResponse, para. 142.\n\n(b) Analysis\n------------\n\n525.\n\nIt is common ground - and rightly so - that the Tribunal has the power to decide the Disqualification Request. This power derives from Articles 43 and 44 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1).\n\n526.\n\nThere is no provision in the ICSID framework contemplating the disqualification of a tribunal-appointed expert. The Claimants resort to Article 57 of the ICSID Convention by analogy, a proposition that Guinea opposes arguing that the decision-making function of arbitrators must be distinguished from the role of experts, which is limited to giving evidence.\n\n527.\n\nBy contrast, Article 6.2 of the IBA Rules on Evidence, to which the Tribunal may look for guidance according to PO1,675 allows a Party to object against a tribunal-appointed expert at the time of appointment or later. This latter possibility is stipulated in the following terms:\n\n\"After the appointment of a Tribunal-Appointed Expert, a Party may object to the expert\u2019s *qualifications or independence* only if the objection is for reasons of which the Party becomes aware after the appointment has been made. The Arbitral Tribunal shall decide promptly what, if any, action to take.\" (Emphasis added)\n\nParagraph 25.1 PO1. Further, paragraph 1 of the Terms of Reference of the Tribunal-appointed Experts refers to Article 6(1) of the IBA Rules on Evidence.\n\n528.\n\nThis provision only foresees objections to the qualifications or independence of Tribunal-appointed Experts. It does not mention impartiality. Neither does it speak of disqualification or similar terms. Be this as it may, the Tribunal can leave it open whether a party may seek the disqualification of a tribunal-appointed expert for lack of impartiality during the course of his or her mandate. Indeed, the Experts have produced the Final Report which is a piece of evidence in the record of these proceedings. ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(1) provides that the Tribunal is the judge of the admissibility and weight of the evidence. As as result, it may discard evidence, if circumstances so justify. Similarly, Article 9(1) and (2) of the IBA Rules on Evidence provides that the Tribunal \"shall determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of evidence\" and \"shall, at the request of a Party or on its own motion, exclude from evidence or production any Document, statement, oral testimony or inspection for [...] (g) considerations of procedural economy, proportionality, fairness or equality of the Parties that the Arbitral Tribunal determines to be compelling\".\n\n529.\n\nHaving canvassed the legal framework, the Tribunal can now address the facts and submissions. The Claimants take issue with paragraphs 8 to 12 of the Final Report. More specifically, they consider that the criticisms contained in these passages (reproduced above at paragraphs 505) raise reasonable doubts about the Experts\u2019 impartiality.676\n\nProposal, para. 21.\n\n530.\n\nParagraphs 8 to 12 of the Final Report address events that post-date the issuance of the Preliminary Report. The Claimants raise no concern about the Experts' impartiality during the inspection procedure and in relation with the Preliminary Report. That report already contains the bulk of the Experts' scientific findings as well as their conclusions, which remained unchanged in the Final Report and in the Experts' oral testimony. Hence, the Tribunal does not see how the views reflected in paragraphs 8 to 12 about facts that occurred *after the Preliminary Report* could have influenced the Experts' findings that were *already present in the Preliminary Report.* As a consequence, save possibly for the litigious paragraphs that are discussed below, there is no basis for declaring the Final Report inadmissible. Similarly, there is no basis for disqualifying the Experts as a result of the assessments made in these paragraphs.\n\n531.\n\nThis conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the Experts took into account a number of the Claimants' comments to the Preliminary Report and consequently made amendments to the Final Report. They in particular modified the Final Report in response to five of the questions asked by the Claimants.\n\n532.\n\nThere remains the question whether paragraphs 8 to 12 must be declared inadmissible. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the Experts use strong language in several places, and that some of their concerns are speculative. That said, the Tribunal understands that the Experts' controversial views were prompted by their \"duty to inform the Tribunal of some concerns\". Moreover, they qualified their remarks with terms such as \"in our opinion\", \"it appears\", \"it seems\". They also carried out their tasks regardless of the concerns expressed, deferring to the Tribunal to decide whether any consequences were in order.\n\n533.\n\nMore significantly, certain concerns expressed by the Experts have proven true. For instance, it was established that the Claimants contacted a new expert on 8 January 2018 that is five days after having received the Preliminary Report. It has also been shown that the Claimants' request for an extension of their time-limit to comment on the Preliminary Report was actually prompted by their new expert,677 when they kept silent on the change of experts in the communication seeking the extension.\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 37:16-18, 42:12-14 (Ostrove, Radley).\n\n534.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Radley stated that he played no role in drawing up the 65 questions submitted by the Claimants.678 His lack of involvement could likely explain the concern raised by the Experts that some of these questions were \"rhetorical and without background or foundation\".679\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 43:7-45:5 (Ostrove, Radley).\n\nFinal Report, para. 12.\n\n535.\n\nMore generally, the Tribunal denotes no *animus* in paragraphs 8 to 12 on the part of the Experts vis-\u00e0-vis Mr. Radley and the Claimants. This was in particular confirmed during the Authenticity Hearing, when the Experts acknowledged Mr. Radley's standing and professionalism.680\n\nFor instance, Tr. (DA), Day 1, 96:23-97:6 (LaPorte).\n\n536.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal is of the view that the Final Report does not show bias against the Claimants or their expert. Accordingly, it denies the Disqualification Request, which as defined above includes the application to exclude the Final Report from the record. That said, the Tribunal does not need to rely on paragraphs 8 to 12 to reach a decision on the authenticity of the Disputed Documents. It will thus disregard these paragraphs in its analysis.\n\niii. *Identification of the Disputed Documents*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n537.\n\nAs stated in PO14, the Claimants allege that the following documents are forgeries:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Document** | **Date** | **Exhibit** |\n| (i) BSGR Guinea/Matinda Protocol | 20 June 2007 | Exh. R-27 |\n| (ii) BSGR Guinea/Matinda Protocol | 27 February 2008 | Exh. R-28 |\n| (iii) BSGR Guinea/Matinda Protocol | 28 February 2008 | Exh. R-29 |\n| (iv) \u00ab Attestation de cession d'actions de Mme Tour\u00e9 \u00e0 BSGR \u00bb | 2 August 2009 | Exh. R-269 |\n| (v) Payment Letter Pentler/Ms. Tour\u00e9 | 8 July 2010 | Exh. R-30 |\n\n538.\n\nThe first three documents (Exh. R-27 to Exh. R-29) are protocols that were purportedly concluded between BSGR Guinea and Matinda and Co. Limited-Sarl, which is a Guinean company set up by Ms. Tour\u00e9. The first document (Exh. R-27) bears signatures of Mr. Marc Struik and Ms. Tour\u00e9, although Mr. Struik denies having signed it. The second and third documents (Exh. R-28 Exh. to R-29) bear signatures of Mr. Asher Avidan and Ms. Tour\u00e9, although Mr. Avidan denies having signed them. The fourth document (Exh. R-269) bears the signature of Ms. Tour\u00e9, and the fifth (Exh. R-30) of an official of Pentler and Ms. Tour\u00e9.\n\n539.\n\nIn addition, the Claimants dispute the authenticity of the following documents:\n\n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Document** | **Date** | **Exhibit** |\n| (vi) Pentler/Ms. Tour\u00e9 Protocol | 20 February 2006 | Exh. R-24 |\n| (vii) Engagement Letter N\u00b0 1 Pentler/ Ms. Tour\u00e9 | undated, legalized 21 July 2006 | Exh. R-25 |\n| (viii) Engagement Letter N\u00b0 2 Pentler/ Ms. Tour\u00e9 | undated, legalized 21 July 2006 | Exh. R-26 |\n| (ix) Pentler/Matinda Contract | 3 August 2010 | Exh. R-31 |\n| (x) Pentler/Matinda/Ms. Tour\u00e9 Contract | undated | Exh. R-32 |\n| (xi) Pentler/Matinda Contract | 3 August 2010 | Exh. R-346 |\n\n540.\n\nThe first three documents (Exh. R-24 to Exh. R-26) bear signatures of Mr. Lev Ran and Ms. Tour\u00e9. The remaining documents (Exh. R-31, Exh. R-32 and Exh. R-346) were purportedly signed by a Pentler official and Ms. Tour\u00e9.\n\n541.\n\nExcept for Exh. R-30 and Exh. R-346, the originals of the Disputed Documents were in the custody of the FBI, which accepted to make them available for the inspection.681\n\nThe Tribunal requested that the Parties provide best available copies of Exh. R-30 and Exh. R-346, which they were not in a position to do.\n\n542.\n\nFor the inspection, the FBI handed over three additional documents, which the Experts labelled as DOC A, DOC B and DOC C.682 It is common ground that the content of DOC A is identical to page 1 of Exh. R-32, that the content of DOC B is identical to page 2 of Exh. R-32, and that these documents appear to be initialed and signed by the same persons, although the initials and signatures are different. The content of DOC C appears identical to Exh. R-33, which is not a Disputed Document. The Experts inspected DOCs A to C and reached the following conclusion:\n\n- Page 2 of Exh. R-32 was not originally attached to page 1 of Exh. R-32, and the evidence suggested that page 1 from Exh. R-32 was originally fastened to DOC B, and page 2 from Exh. R-32 was originally fastened to DOC A;\n\n- There is evidence to suggest that Exh. R-30 and DOC C may have been attached to each other at one time.\n\nHigh resolution copies of these additional documents were provided to the Parties at the start of the document inspection.\n\niv. *Expert Terms of Reference and Document Inspection*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n543.\n\nAfter consulting the Parties and pursuant to Article 43(b) *in fine* of the ICSID Convention, ICSID Arbitration Rule 34(2)(b) *in fine,* paragraph 25 of PO1 in combination with Article 6(1) of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence (2010), and paragraph 17 of Procedural Order No. 11, the Tribunal issued Terms of Reference for the Experts, which the latter signed on 24 October 2017.\n\n544.\n\nThe Experts\u2019 mandate was to assist the Tribunal in ascertaining the authenticity of the Disputed Documents by undertaking a full forensic analysis. The Experts were provided the following documents and materials:\n\n- Original versions of the Disputed Documents, wherever available;\n\n- Copies of the Disputed Documents;\n\n- Original versions, or else best available copies, of comparator documents containing contemporaneous signatures of the individuals whose signatures appear on the Disputed Documents.\n\n545.\n\nThe Experts were instructed to use inspection techniques in accordance with accepted industry practice, in particular standards of the Scientific Working Group for Forensic Document Examination (\"SWGDOC\"). Except for the minimally invasive examination required for ink testing, the Experts were further instructed to use, in principle, non-invasive and non-destructive inspection techniques.\n\n546.\n\nThe Terms of Reference also provided that the Experts issue a preliminary version of the report within 45 days of the document inspection, followed by an opportunity for the Parties to comment, the issuance of the final version of the report, and a further opportunity for the Parties to comment on the Final Report.\n\n547.\n\nWith the consent of all involved, the Document Inspection was conducted between 31 October and 3 November 2017 at the New York offices of DLA Piper. The Tribunal issued a Document Inspection Protocol setting out logistics and guidance on communications between the Experts and the Parties' representatives and experts. That Protocol in particular required the Parties to raise objections immediately or at the latest at the end of each half-day of inspection.\n\n548.\n\nThe Experts inspected original versions of all the Disputed Documents listed above, with the exception of Exhibits R-30 and R-346 of which they inspected best available copies. In addition, the Experts inspected DOCs A, B and C referred to above. In the light of their respective specialisations, Mr. Welch conducted the handwriting examinations and Mr. LaPorte the document examinations.\n\n549.\n\nIn addition to the Experts, the Parties' counsel and forensic experts attended the Document Inspection. As experts, the Claimants retained the services of Mr. Dennis Ryan and Ms. Laura Mancebo, and later Mr. Robert Radley, and the Respondent retained the services of Mr. Richard Picciochi. The Tribunal\u2019s Secretary was also in attendance, monitored the process, and prepared daily summary minutes. An FBI agent was also present.\n\nv. *The Final Report*\n---------------------\n\n550.\n\nThe Final Report, which was issued on 12 February 2018, sets out the Experts' qualifications, lists the documents subject to inspection and comparator documents, describes the examination methods employed, and the Experts' findings.\n\n551.\n\nThe Experts used the following examination methods: handwriting examinations, various physical examinations, including visual and microscopic, indented writing/impression evidence, rubber hand stamps, interlineations/additions, and ink/toner transfer, as well as optical examinations, including ultraviolet (UV), infrared reflectance (IRR) and infrared luminescence (IRL), and chemical examinations, including thin-layer chromatography (TLC), and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS).683\n\nAt the Authenticity Hearing, Mr. LaPorte explained that he conducted \"multiple exams\" of the documents, including visual examination (e.g. paper, stale holes), page substitution, printing (toner, inkjet, CPS code), chemical analysis (ink, paper), stamp analysis, interlineations, indentation examination (ESDA), and ink transfer.\n\n552.\n\nBefore assessing each document separately, the Experts analyzed ink and paper. They identified 13 inks, of which 10 were certainly commercially available prior to the purported dates of the documents.684 The Experts further identified the use of 6 different types of paper,685 3 different black toners for Exh. R-24, Exh. R-25, Exh. R-26 and Exh. R-27,686 and inkjet ink for Exh. R-28, Exh. R-29, Exh. R-31, Exh. R-32, Exh. R-269, Doc A, Doc B and Doc C.687\n\nThe Experts could not reach a conclusion on whether the inks they labeled as inks 5, 6 and 9 were commercially available on the \"purported date of preparation of the documents\" (Final Report, para. 65). Ink 5 was used for the Marc Struik signature and Ink 6 for the Mamadie Tour\u00e9 signature in Exh. R-27. With respect to Ink 5, the Experts explained that this ink was \"not extractable in the solvents used for this analysis indicating this is a pigment-based ink\". Nor was Ink 6 extractable, but the Experts explained that differences between Inks 5 and 6 were identified during the VSC analysis, adding that \"Ink 5 and 6 had slightly different properties when the extract was applied to the thin layer chromatography plate indicating they have different solubility properties\". Final Report, p. 41, n. 8-9.\n\nFinal Report, para. 66.\n\nFinal Report, para. 67.\n\nFinal Report, para. 67.\n\n553.\n\nThe Experts reached the following general conclusions with respect to the Disputed Documents and DOCs A, B, and C:\n\n- There is no evidence of page substitution, text alteration, text addition, or other irregularities to indicate that any of the Disputed Documents were fraudulently produced.\n\n- Page 2 of R-32 was not originally attached to page 1 of R-32. Rather, there is evidence that page 1 from R-32 was originally fastened to DOC B; and page 2 from R-32 was originally fastened to DOC A.\n\n- There is evidence to indicate that R-30 (a non-original electronic PDF) and DOC C may have been attached to each other at one time.\n\n- It has been concluded that Avraham Lev Ran wrote the disputed Avraham Lev Ran signatures on R-24, R-25, and R-26.\n\n- There are indications that Avraham Lev Ran may have written the disputed A.L. initials on R-26.\n\n- It has been concluded that Marc Struik wrote the disputed Marc Struik signature on R-27.\n\n- It has been concluded that Avidan Asher wrote the disputed Avidan Asher signatures on R-28 and R-29.\n\n- There are indications that the Lansana Tinkiano (Le Greffier en Chef) signatures on R-25, R-26, and R-27 may have all been written by the same person.\n\n- There are indications that the Mamadie Toure signatures on R-24, R-27 through R-32, R-269, R-346.2, DOC B, and DOC C may have all been written by the same person.\n\n- Although no known comparison samples were submitted for comparison with the remaining disputed signatures, no evidence or characteristics commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries were observed.688\n\nFinal Report, p. 9.\n\nvi. *Assessment of the Disputed Documents*\n------------------------------------------\n\n554.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address some general criticisms which the Claimants raise about the Experts\u2019 work (i). Therafter, it will review each Disputed Document separately, by first describing the document, and then setting out the Expert\u2019s conclusions, the Parties\u2019 positions, the comments by the Party-appointed experts, and its assessment ((ii) - (xii)) before reaching its conclusion (xiii).\n\n(a) General observations\n------------------------\n\n555.\n\nThe Claimants and their expert criticize the Experts\u2019 work on a number of points. First, they take issue with the terminology employed by the Experts when expressing their findings. More specifically, they dispute the Experts\u2019 use of the terminology \"*no evidence.* Mr. Radley notes that the SWGDOC guidelines do no use that term and it is thus not a \"recognized term\".689 He also opines that the words employed by the Experts are potentially misleading and the Tribunal should not understand them to mean that the Disputed Documents are genuine. Mr. Radley adds that the \"absence of evidence is not evidence of absence\".690 As for the Claimants, they rather criticize the terms \"no evidence of fraud\". Instead of speaking of \"no evidence of fraud\", Mr. LaPorte should have used the wording \"no evidence of alteration*\"*. This distinction is \"fundamental\", say the Claimants. In any event, according to the Claimants, Mr. LaPorte\u2019s \"no evidence\" conclusions are indeterminate, which even the Respondent\u2019s expert admitted, calling them \"inconclusive\".691\n\nRadley Report, para. 72.\n\nRadley Report, para. 60.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 304.\n\n556.\n\nWhen reviewing these issues of terminology, the Tribunal is aware that there is no common terminology adopted by document examiners and that the way in which conclusions are expressed remains controversial in the industry.692 In the same vein, it notes that the SWGDOC standards are mere guidelines.\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 157:8-11 and 22-24 (LaPorte).\n\n557.\n\nThe general conclusions in the Final Report use the terms \"no evidence of fraud\". They state that \"[t]here is no evidence of page substitution, text alteration, text addition, or other irregularities to indicate that [the Disputed Documents] were fraudulently produced\".693 It appears to the Tribunal that this language is similar to the Claimants\u2019 preferred wording of \"no evidence of alteration\". In fact, the Final Report does use the words \"no evidence of alteration\" on several occasions.694\n\nFinal Report, p. 9, quoted in paragraph 553 above.\n\nSee, e.g. Final Report, paras. 89, 109, 134, 157, 174, 188, 198, 210, 226, 240, 251, 258, 264, 274.\n\n558.\n\nFurther, the SWGDOC Standard Terminology for Expressing Conclusions of Forensic Document Examiners provides guidelines \"intended to assist forensic document examiners in expressing conclusions or opinions based on their examinations\". That terminology lists \"recommended terms\" in section 4.1 and \"deprecated and discouraged expressions\" in section 4.2, which are deemed to be potentially \"troublesome\". The expression \"no evidence\" is neither \"deprecated\" nor \"discouraged\". Unlike Mr. Radley, the Tribunal does not see why such expression could be \"troublesome\". Therefore, it discerns no reason to take issue with the Experts\u2019 formulation \"no evidence of fraud\". By contrast, the term \"inconclusive\",695 which Mr. Radley often uses appears among the \"deprecated and discouraged expressions\" listed in section 4.2 of the SWGDOC guidelines.\n\nSee, e.g., Radley Report, paras. 180, 189, 204, and in particular with respect to signatures, paras. 14, 17, 261, 305 and p. 85.\n\n559.\n\nFinally, Mr. Radley also complains about the frequency with which the Experts employ the term \"no evidence\".696 Yet, the authors Kelly and Lindblom, to which the Claimants refer, consider that for each single test and for \"each specific page, the document examiner must be able to say that there is no evidence that a word, sentence, or paragraph had been added\",697 adding that \"[w]hen the combined results reveal no change, it can be stated that there is no evidence to support that this document was altered\".698 There is thus nothing improper when Mr. LaPorte writes for each test that he found no evidence of alteration or fraud.\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 11:1-7.\n\nJan Seaman Kelly, Brian S. Lindblom, *Scientific Examination of Questioned Documents*, Taylor & Francis, 2nd edition, p. 334.\n\nJan Seaman Kelly, Brian S. Lindblom, *Scientific Examination of Questioned Documents*, Taylor & Francis, 2nd edition, p. 335.\n\n560.\n\nSecond, the Claimants and their expert regard Mr. LaPorte's approach as fundamentally unsound reaching conclusions that cannot be trusted, in particular because he failed to consider alternative propositions and ignored evidence of alteration. The Tribunal does not share this view. At the same time, it notes that all of the experts (Messrs. LaPorte, Radley and Aginsky) who testified on the authenticity of the documents (as opposed to the signatures appearing on the documents) essentially concurred to say that the result of the document analysis was rather neutral. In other words, they seemed to agree that the testing procedures were not capable of showing whether the documents were authentic or not.699 When making this observation, the Tribunal is mindful of Mr. Radley's statement that he was not concerned about specific alterations, since he was instructed that the documents as a whole were fabricated.700 Thus, the Tribunal understands that the document examinations do not shed much light on the genuineness of the Disputed Documents. It will therefore mainly focus on the handwriting examinations. That said, the Tribunal will address specific issues or oddities raised by the Claimants and their expert with respect to the documents where necessary.\n\nMr. Radley stated that the \"testing procedures are not capable of detecting the relevant evidence proving authenticity\" and that it is equally likely that the documents are authentic or that they are forged (Radley Report, para. 61). Mr. Aginsky agreed that the document examination was overall \"inconclusive\" (Tr. (DA), Day 2, 137:13-14 (Aginsky). Mr. LaPorte also stated that he agreed with Mr. Radley's statement that the absence of evidence of alteration or fraud does not necessarily mean that the documents are genuine (Tr. (DA), Day 2, 160:9-11 (LaPorte). In fact, he stated that it can never be proven that a document is genuine (Tr. (DA), Day 2, 161:19-20 (LaPorte).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 13:2-8 (Radley).\n\n561.\n\nThird, the Claimants and their expert also criticize the handwriting examinations. They are of the view that Mr. Welch failed to address differences or rarities in the disputed signatures, while at the same time conceding that these variations fell outside the range of variation.701 Definitions of terms such as \"variation\", \"range of variation\", and \"significant difference\" can be found in the SWGDOC Standard for Examination of Handwritten Items. \"Variations\" are defined as \"those deviations among repetitions of the same handwriting characteristic(s) that are normally demonstrated in the habits of each writer\" (section 3.3.15). A \"range of variation\" is defined as \"the accumulation of deviations among repetitions of respective handwriting characteristics that are demonstrated in the writing habits of an individual\" (section 3.3.10). A \"significant difference\" is \"an individualizing characteristic that is structurally divergent between handwritten items, that is outside the range of variation of the writer, and that cannot be reasonably explained\" (section 3.3.11). The SWGDOC guidelines adds the following commentary:\n\n\"Since variation is an integral part of natural writing, no two writings of the same material by the same writer are identical in every detail. Within a writer's range of variation, there are handwriting habits and patterns that are repetitive and similar in nature. These repetitive features give handwriting a distinctive individuality for examination purposes. Variation can be influenced by internal factors such as illness, medication, intentional distortion, etc. and external factors such as writing conditions and writing instrument, etc.\"702\n\nC-PHB1, para. 321.\n\nSWGDOC Standard for Examination of Handwritten Items, at Final Report, Annex C.\n\n562.\n\nOn variations and differences, Albert Osborn, who is the authority most cited in matters of handwriting analysis to whom both Parties refer, writes as follows:\n\n\"In a trial in which forgery is alleged the attempt is usually made to account for, or excuse, what often are the most glaring and fundamental divergences in a handwriting by the argument that genuine writing is not always just alike and therefore divergences do not indicate forgery. These attempted excuses for forgery often are ridiculously incredible. The fallacy in the reasoning, of course, is the failure to consider the amount or the nature and the quality of the differences.\n\nThe opposite error is made when a trivial difference is made the basis of a charge of forgery and any difference is interpreted as pointing to another personality*.* The conclusion that a writing is not genuine is only properly reached when it contains divergences in amount and quality beyond the range of variation in the standard writing that cannot reasonably be accounted for by changed conditions in the writer or surrounding the writer\".703\n\nAlbert S. Osborn, *Questioned Documents*, 2nd edition, p. 205 (Emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n563.\n\nAccordingly, variations are deviations from handwriting characteristics that are within a writer\u2019s habits. A range of variations is the accumulation of such deviations which are still within the writer\u2019s habits. By contrast, a significant difference is a deviation that falls outside of the range of variations and cannot be explained by changed conditions, be they internal or external to the writer. Only significant differences are indicative of simulation or forgery. In other words, a mere difference or deviation is not suggestive of simulation or forgery.\n\n564.\n\nThe Tribunal will bear these explanations in mind when reviewing the evidence in respect of each of the disputed signatures. Only then will it be in a position to determine whether, as the Claimants contend, the Experts have disregarded relevant differences between disputed and undisputed signatures.\n\n(b) Exhibit R-24\n----------------\n\n(i) Description of document\n---------------------------\n\n565.\n\nExh. R-24 is a two-page contract entitled \"Protocole d\u2019accord\" purportedly concluded between Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Pentler Holdings Ltd. The first page shows Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s signature on the bottom-left of the page and an adhesive fiscal stamp affixed with a stamp of the \"Greffier en Chef\u2019 of the Court of First Instance of Conakry on the top of the document. On the second page, one also finds at the top a fiscal stamp affixed with a stamp of the \"Greffier en Chef\". There is also a printed line indicating that the document was signed in Conakry on 20 February 2006. In addition, there is a printed signature line with Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s name and what appears to be her signature, as well as a printed signature line with Mr. Lev Ran\u2019s name, a Pentler Holdings Ltd stamp and what appears to be Mr. Lev Ran\u2019s signature to the right. Finally, there is an additional stamp of the \"Greffier en Chef\u2019, a signature of an unidentified person and a legalization stamp with the handwritten date \"02/03/06\" (or \"09/03/06\").\n\n(ii) Experts\u2019 findings\n----------------------\n\n566.\n\nThe Experts\u2019 found that \"[t]here is no evidence of page substitution, text alteration, text addition, or other irregularities to indicate that R-24 was fraudulently produced\".704 With respect to the handwriting examinations, they stated that the disputed Lev Ran signature reveals \"evidence of fluency with good line quality, pen pressure variation, hooks, and tapered strokes\" and that there is \"no evidence of distortion commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries\".705 A comparison of the disputed signature with the known writing of Lev Ran showed \"numerous significant similarities\", including \"height relations, proportions, spacial [sic] relations, hooks, tapered strokes, and retraces\".706 On that basis, the Experts concluded that Mr. Lev Ran wrote the disputed signature on Exh. R-24.\n\nFinal Report, p. 44.\n\nFinal Report, para. 82.\n\nFinal Report, para. 88.\n\n567.\n\nUnlike Mr. Radley, Mr. Welch considered Mr. Lev Ran's signature as a complex signature that even a skilled forger could not reproduce with the same fluency and fine detail.707 He explained that the \"fine and subtle drag strokes\", the \"details\", and the \"flying starts and finishes\" were \"very difficult\" to simulate.708\n\nMr. Welch provided the following explanation: \"In a simplistic signature, yes, they may be able to practice that enough to get that with some fluency, and you might see some of those characteristics. In my opinion, in a signature like the Avraham Lev Ran, it's complex. There's a lot of movement: there's nine different movements, ten if you include the terminal stroke. So I would say: yes, in a signature like Mamadie Tour\u00e9; in my opinion, no, with a signature like with respect to Avraham Lev Ran. They're not going to get all of the handwriting, they're not going to be able to produce the fine and subtle detail in the writing characteristics, with the flying pen starts, the flying pen finishes, the pen drags, the pen pressure variation. Again, when we look at pen pressure variation, all of us let on and off with pressure throughout our signature. We don't think about it, it's an unconscious thing, but it can be very repetitive for that particular person. Well, that's another thing a forger can't get. They can't hold the writing instrument exactly the same way that \u2013 a forger can't hold it the same way as the original person whose writing they're trying to duplicate. They don't have the same muscular, they don't have the same skeletal makeup, they don't have the same arm and wrist movement to replicate that same pen pressure and pen pressure variation\" Tr. (DA), Day 1, 77:20-78:20 (Welch). See also: Tr. (DA), Day 1, 174:11 (Welch).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 166:10-17 (Welch).\n\n(iii) Comments of the Party-appointed experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n568.\n\nMr. Radley criticizes the Experts\u2019 opinion on Mr. Lev Ran\u2019s signature for being based on \"similarities alone\", without any mention of differences.709 For Mr. Radley, that signature \"is not a complex signature\" and \"is not difficult to copy\".710 The structure of the signature is \"very basic in design, effectively three backwards and forwards pen movements and a short, near vertical line\".711\n\nRadley Report, para. 224.\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 32:5-6 (Radley).\n\nRadley Report, para. 233.\n\n569.\n\nMr. Radley further opines that the \"downstroke cutting through the zigzagging lines\" is an irregularity that falls outside the range of variation. In particular, the \"hesitant long upwards introductory stroke\" illustrated at \"A\" in the image below \"is not seen throughout the known writings\". Additionally, the \"distinct upwards and leftwards hook\" at the end of the downstroke, identified with the green arrow in the image below, contrasts with \"the vast majority of comparison signatures\" and is therefore a \"rare occurrence\".712 These \"irregularities\" are also present in the disputed Lev Ran signatures in Exh. R-25 and Exh. R-26, and should not have been ignored by the Experts.713\n\nRadley Report, para. 250.\n\nRadley Report, para. 248, 265.\n\n570.\n\nStill according to Mr. Radley, the unusual length of the downstrokes in Exh. R-24 and Exh. R-25 falls outside the range of variation, and the fact that the two documents were purportedly signed four months apart with a black ballpoint pen, is a \"considerable coincidence\" that could be explained if the two signatures had been simulated at the same time.714 In conclusion, Mr. Radley states that he had \"considerable difficulty in assessing the evidence\" and his opinion is that the evidence is inconclusive on whether the signature is authentic or simulated.715\n\nRadley Report, para. 253.\n\nRadley Report, para. 261.\n\n571.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s handwriting expert, Mr. Picciochi, sees no \"fundamental differences\" in this signature, which he regards as \"consistent\" and falling \"within the known writing variation\".716 The \"speed, pressure variation, flying stars and stops\" are all present in the known writings and are thus \"indicative of naturalness\".717 In addition, the sequence of strokes, including the introductory and terminal strokes of the vertical line, are \"very consistent\" with known writings.718 In sum, for Mr. Picciochi, there is \"evidence to support the proposition that the questioned signature was made by the author of the known writings\".719\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 108:8-13 (Picciochi).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 113:20-22 (Picciochi).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 115:13-15 (Picciochi).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 117:7-11 (Picciochi).\n\n(iv) Parties' positions\n-----------------------\n\n572.\n\nThe Claimants take \"no position as to the authenticity\" of Exh. R-24, but argue that the Tribunal should treat this document with \"caution\".720 They point to the discrepancy between the signing date on the contract and the legalization date, which the Experts did not address.721 In addition, the Claimants argue that the terms of the contract are \"confusing\" and that the Respondent failed to provide evidence of the implementation of the contract.722\n\nC-PHB1, para. 261.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 261(ii).\n\nC-PHB1, para. 261(iii).\n\n573.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that the forensic analysis has now shown that there are no doubts on the authenticity of the Disputed Documents. In particular, Mr. Welch had no reservations or doubts that Mr. Lev Ran signed Exh. R-24,723 and Mr. Radley did not challenge the Experts' finding when stating that he could not provide any conclusive opinion.724\n\nR-PHB1, para. 131.\n\nR-PHB1, para. 140.\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n574.\n\nThe Claimants are not alleging that Exh. R-24 is a forged document. Although they expressed doubts on the document's authenticity at the end of the Merits Hearing, the Claimants now merely invite the Tribunal to treat this document with caution. As for their expert, he finds the evidence inconclusive. He finds the proposition that the document is genuine equally likely as the opposite conclusion. In connection with the signature, Mr. Radley focuses on the initial downstroke, and in particular on the initial stroke and the end hook, arguing that these features \"contrast to the *vast majority* of comparison signatures\" (emphasis added by the Tribunal). Accordingly, Mr. Radley concedes that some comparators have similar features, which thus are within the range of variation of the known Lev Ran writing. These features are therefore variations, not differences, let alone significant differences.\n\n575.\n\nBy contrast, the Experts identified \"numerous significant similarities\", including \"height relations, proportions, spacial [sic] relations, hooks, tapered strokes, and retraces\".725 At the Authenticity Hearing, Mr. Welch testified that there was \"obvious evidence of genuineness with this particular signature\".726 With respect to the vertical stroke, he stated that \"at the top of the vertical stroke [was] a nice long flying start or drag stroke up to the top of the document where it proceeds down. It has a hook down to the bottom left of that vertical, which is another flying ending stroke\".727 He further noted the presence of \"unique and subtle details\", including the \"nice and smooth\" line quality, the smoothness of the edges, the variations in the line widths, and pen pressure variation. Mr. Welch also found that these \"individual unique handwriting characteristics\" fell within the range of variation.\n\nFinal Report, para. 88.\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 70:16-17 (Welch). See also: Tr. (DA), Day 1, 175:22-176:4 and 177:6-19 (Welch).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 70:18-22 (Welch).\n\n576.\n\nThe Claimants did not address this assessment of Mr. Lev Ran\u2019s signature in their post-hearing briefs. They merely took issue with the Experts\u2019 finding that there were only indications that Ms. Tour\u00e9 signed the document. They also referred to matters not within the forensic inspection, which are thus not considered here, namely the \"discrepancy\" between the date of the document (i.e. 20 February 2006) and the date of its legalization (i.e. 2 March 2006) and the confusing terms of the agreement.\n\n577.\n\nThe Tribunal sees no reason to doubt the forensic assessment of the Experts. They explained convincingly that the disputed signature showed common characteristics with known writing habits of Mr. Lev Ran. They explained in a similarly compelling manner that divergences were within the range of admissible variations, emphasing in particular \"fine subtle details\" such as flying starts and finishes or the quality of the lines and edges. More importantly, the Claimants\u2019 expert did not identify a single difference beyond a variation. On that basis, the Tribunal cannot but find that there is no element allowing it to doubt that Mr. Lev Ran signed this document.\n\n578.\n\nWith respect to the signatures of Ms. Tour\u00e9 appearing on Exh. R-24, the Tribunal notes that the Experts did not reach a definitive conclusion because they lacked comparison signatures outside the Disputed Documents. The same applies to the signature of the Greffier en Chef. However, the Experts compared the signatures of Ms. Tour\u00e9 with those in the Disputed Documents and found that there were \"indications that the Mamadie Tour\u00e9 signatures on Exh. R-24, Exh. R-27 through Exh. R-32, Exh. R-269, Exh. R-346.2, DOC B, and DOC C may have all been written by the same person\".728\n\nFinal Report, p. 9.\n\n579.\n\nSignificantly, the forensic evidence is corroborated by [REDACTED] according to which Pentler concluded the contract found in Exh. R-24 with Ms. Tour\u00e9, as the Claimants acknowledged in their Reply:\n\n\"As regards the contracts between Pentler and Mamadie Tour\u00e9/Matinda, Guinea criticise [sic] BSGR for asserting that they were false. Those assertions were made genuinely at the time, and prior to BSGR having an opportunity to question Mr Noy (who is neither an employee nor an agent of BSGR) about the contracts between Pentler and Mamadie Tour\u00e9. At that time, BSGR had real concerns regarding the authenticity of those contracts. However, Mr Noy has subsequently confirmed that they are genuine.\"729\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 32 (Emphasis added by the Tribunal). [REDACTED] reads in relevant part: \"Pentler did have contracts with Matinda. These contracts were for legitimate business that they were engaged in, regarding mining, pharmaceuticals, commercial goods and a wider range of business activities. BSGR was not involved in those activities in any way\". Footnotes omitted. [REDACTED]\n\n580.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that the evidence on record shows that Mr. Lev Ran and Ms. Tour\u00e9 did sign Exh. R-24.\n\n(c) Exhibit R-25\n----------------\n\n(i) Description of document\n---------------------------\n\n581.\n\nExh. R-25 is a two-page document entitled *\"lettre d\u2019engagement\u2019,* i.e. an engagement letter from Pentler Holdings Ltd in favor of Ms. Tour\u00e9. The first page shows an adhesive fiscal stamp affixed with a stamp of the Greffier en Chef of the Court of First Instance of Conakry on the top right of a document. The top right of the second page also contains a stamp duty with a stamp of the Greffier en Chef. The document is undated. The bottom of the second page contains a Pentler Holdings Ltd stamp and what appears to be Mr. Lev Ran's signature. Finally, there is an additional stamp of the Greffier en Chef, together with the signature of Mr. Tinkiano and a legalization stamp with the handwritten date \"21/07/06\".\n\n(ii) Experts\u2019 findings\n----------------------\n\n582.\n\nThe Experts\u2019 found that \"[t]here is no evidence of page substitution, text alteration, text addition, or other irregularities to indicate that R-25 was fraudulently produced\".730 As with Exh. R-24, the disputed Lev Ran signature reveals \"evidence of fluency with good line quality, pen pressure variation, hooks, and tapered strokes\" and there is \"no evidence of distortion commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries\".731 A comparison of that signature with known writings of Lev Ran \"revealed numerous significant similarities\", including \"height relations, proportions, spacial [sic] relations, hooks, tapered strokes, and retraces\".732 Moreover, the Experts note the same \"fine and subtle details\" as for the Lev Ran signature in Exh. R-24 (see above paragraphs 566-567). They in particular consider that all the features identified fall within the range of variation of Mr. Lev Ran\u2019s writing.\n\nFinal Report, p. 64.\n\nFinal Report para. 105.\n\nFinal Report, para. 108.\n\n583.\n\nOn that basis, the Experts conclude that \"Avraham Lev Ran wrote the disputed Avraham Lev Ran signatures on R-25\".733\n\nFinal Report, para. 108.\n\n(iii) The comments of the Party-appointed experts\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n584.\n\nMr. Radley disagrees with the Experts\u2019 findings and stresses the existence of differences. For him, the disputed Lev Ran signature in Exh. R-25 \"appears to be far more of a \"star\" shape with the extremities of the vertical downstroke through the signature protruding to for additional star 'points\u2019\".734 As with Exh. R-24, Mr. Radley opines that the vertical stroke is \"disproportionately long relative to the stroke that determines the width of these signatures\".735 He also points to the \"unusually large protrusion either side of the main line\" as illustrated at B and C in the image below*:736*\n\nRadley Report, para. 251.\n\nRadley Report, para. 252.\n\nRadley Report, para. 251.\n\n585.\n\nMr. Picchiochi opines in the same manner as he did for Exh. R-24 (see above paragraph 571).\n\n(iv) Parties\u2019 positions\n-----------------------\n\n586.\n\nThe Claimants call attention to the fact that Exh. R-25 is undated, but legalised on 21 July 2006. Guinea\u2019s case that the document was sent to Mamadie Tour\u00e9 in January 2006 and then legalized five months later does \"not make sense\".737 Given the contradictions in Mr. Tinkiano\u2019s testimony and his inability to say whether Ms. Tour\u00e9 attended the legalization, the Claimants \"cannot take a position on the authenticity\" of this document. Finally, they stress that the serial numbering on the stamp in Exh. R-25 is lower than the number on the stamp in Exh. R-24, an inconsistency that the Experts have not explained.738\n\nC-PHB1, para. 265.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 267.\n\n587.\n\nThe Respondent raises the same arguments for Exh. R-25 as for Exh. R-24 (see above paragraph 573).\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n588.\n\nFor essentially the same reasons as for Exh. R-24, the Tribunal sees no reason to put the forensic assessment of the Experts in doubt. Here again, their explanations were convincing and, more importantly, the Claimants\u2019 expert did not identify a single significant difference, which could have led the Tribunal to question the Experts\u2019 findings.\n\n589.\n\nWith respect to the sequencing of the serial numbers found on the adhesive stamps, the record contains insufficient information for the Tribunal to make a finding. In the circumstances, that element cannot change the result reached through the forensic examination, and the Tribunal tends to agree with the Experts that \"there is no evidence to indicate that the Adhesive Stamps were attached to R-25 on any other date than purported\".739\n\nFinal Report, para. 100.\n\n590.\n\nOn the evidence before it, the Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. Lev Ran signed this document.\n\n(d) Exhibit R-26\n----------------\n\n(i) Description of document\n---------------------------\n\n591.\n\nExh. R-26 is a four-page document entitled *\"lettre d\u2019engagement\u2019,* i.e. an engagement letter from Pentler Holdings Ltd in favor of Ms. Tour\u00e9. The first page contains an adhesive fiscal stamp affixed with a stamp of the Greffier en Chef of the Court of First Instance of Conakry on the top left of the document. At the bottom right, it also contains the initials \"A.L.\". The top right of the second, third and fourth pages shows an adhesive fiscal stamp with a stamp of the Greffier en Chef. These pages also contain the initials \"A.L.\" at the bottom right. The document is undated. The bottom left of the fourth page contains a Pentler Holdings Ltd stamp and a signature that appears to be Mr. Lev Ran's. Finally, there is an additional stamp of the Greffier en Chef, together the signature of Mr. Tinkiano and a legalization stamp with the handwritten date \"21/07/06\". The following image shows the different A.L. initials in this document:740\n\nFinal Report, p. 78, figure 21.\n\n(ii) Experts\u2019 findings\n----------------------\n\n592.\n\nAs with the previous documents, the Experts\u2019 finding is that \"[t]here is no evidence of page substitution, text alteration, text addition, or other irregularities to indicate that R-26 was fraudulently produced\".741 The disputed Lev Ran signature is said to reveal \"evidence of fluency with good line quality, pen pressure variation, hooks, and tapered strokes\" and there is *\"no evidence of distortion commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries\"*.742 A comparison of that signature with other known writing of Lev Ran *\"revealed numerous significant similarities\",* including \"height relations, proportions, spacial/size [sic] relations, slant, hooks, and tapered strokes\".743 On that basis, the Experts conclude that \"Avraham Lev Ran wrote the disputed Avraham Lev Ran signatures on R-26\".744\n\nFinal Report, p. 75.\n\nFinal Report para. 125.\n\nFinal Report, para. 133.\n\nFinal Report, para. 133.\n\n593.\n\nFurther, the Experts gave evidence that two of the three sets of A.L. initials appear distorted, although they nonetheless \"exhibit variation\" and there is \"some limited internal consistency within each set of initials as well as amongst each other\".745 Thus, the Experts were \"unable to determine if they were written by another writer\".746 The comparison of the initials with the known writings of Mr. Lev Ran revealed \"some limited similarities\", including \"height relations, proportions, special relations, and diacritic markings\". This led the Experts to conclude that \"there are indications that Avraham Lev Ran may have written the disputed A.L. initials on R-26\".\n\nFinal Report, para. 128.\n\nFinal Report, para. 128.\n\n(iii) Comments of the Party-appointed experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n594.\n\nMr. Radley deems the evidence \"inconclusive\" to determine whether the disputed Lev Ran signature is an unusual signature or a simulation.747 He points to the \"significant curve\" at the bottom of the vertical stroke. This feature is not seen \"in any of the forty seven comparison signatures\" and thus falls outside the range of variation.748 According to the expert, simulators pay little attention to the \"way in which the pen is often applied to the paper and lifted from the paper\".749 In addition, Mr. Radley states that there are \"few other differences worth noting\" without, however, identifying these differences in any detail.750\n\nRadley Report, para. 261.\n\nRadley Report, paras. 254, 257.\n\nRadley Report, para. 256.\n\nRadley Report, para. 259.\n\n(iv) Parties' positions\n-----------------------\n\n595.\n\nIn addition to the arguments already raised in respect of Exh. R-25, (e.g. the 2-month discrepancy between the purported date of signature and the date of legalization), the Claimants argue that the Experts failed to explain why they disregarded the \"five inconsistencies\" which they identified in their Report, namely that \"(i) impressions of the later dated document, R-29, were found on R-26 [...]; (ii) a conclusive opinion could not be reached on whether the initials A.L. are those of Lev Ran [...]; (iii) in reaching a determination, a set of apparently \"rogue\" comparator initials were disregarded [.]; (iv) ink/toner was found on the front of page 1, and the back of pages 3 and 4, but the source could not be determined [...]; and (v) a different font size is used on page 1 compared to pages 2 to 4\".751 For the Claimants, Mr. LaPorte simply speculated instead of addressing these inconsistencies by evaluating alternative propositions.752 For instance, changing the font size in the middle of a document \"is the exception rather than the rule\" and thus requires explanation.753\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 267 and 307, n. 634.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 307.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 307.\n\n596.\n\nThe Respondent essentially makes the same submissions here as in the context of Exh. R-24 and Exh. R-25 (see above paragraphs 573 and 587).\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n597.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully reviewed the arguments raised with respect to the five inconsistencies identified in the Final Report, on which the Claimants insist (see above paragraph 595).\n\n598.\n\nThe initials A.L. are one of these inconsistencies. It is true that the A on the first page is different from those on pages 2 to 4. It is also true that, while the Experts identified \"some limited similarities\", including height relations, proportions, special relations and diacritic markings, they were unable to reach a \"more conclusive opinion\",754 absent additional comparator initials. This being so, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, this inconsistency does not carry sufficient weight to cast doubt on the conclusions of the Experts.\n\nFinal Report, para. 132.\n\n599.\n\nMoreover, it is striking that the Claimants\u2019 expert did not address any of these inconsistencies in his report. It is equally telling, that, in spite of these inconsistencies, the Claimants did not allege that the document or the signature were forged.\n\n600.\n\nLike for the previous documents and for the same reasons, the Tribunal thus follows the conclusion of the forensic analysis. Again, the Experts\u2019 explanations are convincing and the Claimants\u2019 expert identified no difference susceptible to put the Experts\u2019 findings in doubt.\n\n601.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the evidence indicates that Mr. Lev Ran signed this document.\n\n(e) Exhibit R-27\n----------------\n\n(i) Description of document\n---------------------------\n\n602.\n\nExh. R-27 is a single page document, which is entitled *\"Protocole d\u2019Accord\u2019* and entered into between Matinda and BSGR Guinea. The top left contains a stamp duty with a stamp of the Greffier en Chef. The document is dated 20 June 2007, with the day and month written by hand. The bottom of the page contains three signatures. On the left is what appears to be Mr. Struik\u2019s signature with the words *\"Directeur G\u00e9n\u00e9ral* written below. On the right is what appears to be Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s signature. In between these two signatures, there is an additional stamp of the Greffier en Chef, together with the signature of Mr. Tinkiano and a legalization stamp with the handwritten date \"20/07/07\".\n\n(ii) Experts\u2019 findings\n----------------------\n\n603.\n\nThe Experts conclude that \"[t]here is no evidence of text alteration, text addition or other irregularities to indicate that R-27 was fraudulently produced\"755 and that \"Marc Struik wrote the disputed Marc Struik signature on R-27\".756\n\nFinal Report, p. 97.\n\nFinal Report, p. 9.\n\n604.\n\nAbout Mr. Struik's signature, they find \"evidence of fluency with good line quality, pen pressure variation, hooks, and tapered strokes\", and \"no evidence of distortion commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries\".757 To the Claimants' questions, the Experts answered that \"[t]here is no evidence of any differences that would suggest someone other than Marc Struik signed the document\".758\n\nFinal Report, para. 149.\n\nFinal Report, Annex L, question 35.\n\n605.\n\nFor Mr. Welch, Mr. Struik's signature is a complex signature that has approximately 20 different movements. He explained that \"the line quality is nice: even edges, variations in line widths, movement into and out of the strokes. So there's no evidence of forgery commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries there\".759 He further confirmed that he did not find \"any differences that would be indicative of another writer\".760\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 83:25-84:6, 211:1-6 (Welch).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 186:20-21, 210:15-16 (Welch).\n\n606.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Welch opined that the differences identified by Mr. Radley are in fact variations. He stressed that a difference is something \"fundamental\" indicating that there is forgery, whereas a variation or a slight dissimilarity \"doesn't mean that somebody else wrote it\".761 In the Final Report, the Experts noted certain characteristics of Mr. Struik's disputed signature, including height relations, proportions, spatial relations, hooks, tapered strokes, retraces and pen drags. Compared to known writings of Marc Struik, the disputed signature revealed \"numerous significant similarities\". As a result, they found that Mr. Struik had written the disputed signature on Exh. R-27.762\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 182:11-22 (Welch).\n\nFinal Report, para. 156.\n\n(iii) Comments of the Party-appointed experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n607.\n\nMr. Radley regards Marc Struik's signature as \"fairly basic\" and not \"very difficult [...] to copy\". He disagrees with the Experts that there are no differences. As shown in the image below, he identifies eight \"demonstrable differences\", some of which he qualifies as \"rarities rarely found\":763\n\nR-27 (Marc Struik)\n\nRadley Report, para. 282. Mr. Radley stated at the hearing that he identified \"five differences, say, and a couple of rarities\" with respect to R-27. Tr. (DA), Day 2, 27:15-16 (Radley).\n\n608.\n\nWith respect to point 1, Mr. Radley argues that the very thin initial loop is an \"obvious rare occurrence\" since a similar feature only appears in the comparison signature K3.1. Concerning point 2, he finds that the proportion between the length of the first loop and the overall height of the structure is \"almost exactly half the height\" and is different from all comparison signatures. While other comparison signatures show a thin second loop when looking at point 3, \"the combination of a very thin first loop and second loop does not appear to the extent noted in the questioned signatures\". The combined width of the loops is less than in K17.13 for instance. The near retracing and the subsequent retrace of the joining loop in point 4 is not seen \"in combination\" in the comparison signatures. While similar in K10.13, the loop there is not as thin. The curvature of the joining stroke bending upwards in point 5 is \"tighter\" than in the comparison signatures. The straight up/down stroke retracing itself in point 6 is not present in the comparison signatures, which show a loop. The small kink in point 7 is more pronounced than in the comparison signatures. It is not as deep in K7.3 or K14.2. This is a \"rare feature, but not a true difference\". The angularity of the curving stroke following the anticlockwise dome in point 8 is \"significantly different\" from the comparison signatures, to the exception of K19.18. Finally, Mr. Radley remarks that, considering the relative proportions of the height to width of the first five elements, the disputed signature \"fits into a far taller rectangle\" than the comparator signatures.\n\n609.\n\nOn that basis, Mr. Radley reaches the following conclusion with respect to Exh. R-27:\n\n\"The combination of differences which fall outside the range of writing variation as shown in the twenty six samples of Mr Struik's signature lead me to the opinion that there is weak to moderate evidence to support the proposition that this was not written by Marc Struik but is a copy of his general signature style. The evidence is, however, far from conclusive but, in my opinion, over the balance of probability.\"764\n\nRadley Report, para. 285.\n\n610.\n\nThe Respondent's expert, Mr. Picciochi, agreed with the Experts' assessment and criticized Mr. Radley for his focus on structural qualities, whereas he should also have looked at the movement qualities. According to Mr. Picciochi \"there are flying starts and stops, varying pen pressure and speed in these. So they appear to be naturally written: there's no evidence of tremor or unusual pen stops, patching and retouching of the signatures. They seem to be reflexively written\".765\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 126:23-127:3.\n\n(iv) Parties' positions\n-----------------------\n\n611.\n\nThe Claimants have consistently stated that this document is a forgery.766 They find support in Mr. Radley's evidence that there are \"demonstrable differences\" between the disputed Struik signature in Exh. R-27 and the other known handwritings of Mr. Struik. They also insist that Mr. Struik was \"disarmingly frank\" that he did not sign this document.767 According to them, Mr. Struik saw an unlegalized version of this document for the first time in a blackmail attempt in 2009. Messrs. Struik, Avidan, Steinmetz and Saada all refuted Ms. Tour\u00e9's claim that she signed this agreement in their presence.768 In addition, it is \"inconceivable\" that Mr. Struik would sign a document where BSGR's name is twice spelled incorrectly.769 Finally, the terms of the document \"do not make sense\", thus further suggesting a forgery.770\n\nC-PHB1, para. 268.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 269(i); Tr. (Merits), Day 4, 200:1-3 (Struik).\n\nC-PHB1, para. 269(iii); Saada (CWS-6), para. 8; Steinmetz (CWS-1), para. 40; Avidan (CWS-3), para. 130; Struik (CWS-2), para. 109.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 269(v).\n\nC-PHB1, para. 270.\n\n612.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Experts' findings that Mr. Struik signed Exh. R-27 and that the document is authentic.\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n613.\n\nExh. R-27 is the only Disputed Document where Mr. Radley concluded that there was \"weak to moderate evidence\" that the signature was not written by Mr. Struik.771 In the same vein, the Claimants assert that Exh. R-27 was forged and Mr. Struik testified that he did not sign this document.\n\nRadley Report, para. 285.\n\n614.\n\nThe following image depicts Marc Struik's disputed signature in Exhibit R-27:772\n\nFinal Report, p. 102.\n\n615.\n\nThat signature was assessed in light of the comparison signatures shown below:773\n\nFinal Report, p. 106.\n\n616.\n\nThe Experts have extensively discussed this disputed signature at the Authenticity Hearing. They have done so on the basis of numerous demonstrative exhibits depicting the \"differences\" and \"rarities\" identified by Mr. Radley.\n\n617.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by noting that Mr. Radley only deemed the characteristic no. 8 relating to the angularity of the curving stroke following the anticlockwise dome (paragraphs 607 and 608 above) to be \"significantly different\" from the comparison signatures. He did not characterize any of the other \"differences\" and \"rarities\" as significant, i.e. differences that cannot be reasonably explained without questioning the identity of the writer. As Mr. Welch explained, rarities do not qualify as \"differences\", let alone \"significant differences\", since rarities are \"handwriting habits that are found within the variation of a writer\".774 Bearing this in mind, the Tribunal will now address each \"difference\" or \"rarity\" identified by Mr. Radley in the image shown in paragraph 607 above.\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 218:7-10 (Welch).\n\n618.\n\nFirst, Mr. Radley argues that the initial loop (marked as point 1) is \"very thin\", which he sees as an \"obvious rare occurrence\". Mr. Welch disagrees and explains that the loop in the comparator K3 is also narrow and has a \"similar loop size\", with a nice hook at the beginning of the stroke:775\n\nMr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 28.\n\n619.\n\nBecause the comparison signature in K3 is similar, which Mr. Radley acknowledged, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Welch that this feature does not qualify as a \"difference\", let alone a \"significant difference\". Accordingly, this feature must be deemed to fall within the range of variation.\n\n620.\n\nSecond, Mr. Radley argues that the proportion between the length of the first loop and the overall height of the structure (point 2 in the image shown in paragraph 607 above) is \"almost exactly half the height\" and is different from all the comparison signatures. Mr. Welch responds that the length of the first loop in relation to the overall height of the structure falls within the range of variation and is \"consistent with [Mr. Struik\u2019s] handwriting habits\", noting that \"the same relative loop size, overall loop size is very similar\":776\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 212:6-25 (Welch).\n\n621.\n\nAs can be seen from the comparison with the signature K3, this feature is within the range of variation of Mr. Struik's writing habits. In this connection, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Radley did not view this feature as a \"significant difference\".\n\n622.\n\nThird, Mr. Radley opines that \"the combination of a very thin first loop and second loop does not appear to the extent noted in the questioned signatures\" (point 3 in the image shown in paragraph 607 above). According to him, the combined width of the loops is less than for instance in K17.13. Mr. Welch disputes that this feature constitutes a difference. Reviewing the comparison signatures, the Tribunal notes that they show considerable variations among them in this respect. Hence, the Tribunal does not believe that this feature is suggestive of a forgery.\n\n623.\n\nFourth, Mr. Radley opines that the near retracing and the subsequent retrace of the joining loop (point 4 in the image shown in paragraph 607 above) is not seen \"in combination\" in the comparison signatures. While similar in K10.13, the loop there is not as thin. Mr. Welch disagrees. While he accepts that the loop formation is not wide, he is of the view that this feature is part of the \"same movement\" and must be attributed to variation.777 Similar examples can be found in comparison signatures K10.3 and K12.1, which are shown below and demonstrate that this feature is part of Mr. Struik's handwriting habit:778\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 214:15-215:23 (Welch).\n\nMr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 31.\n\n624.\n\nMr. Picciochi agreed with Mr. Welch. He further explained that the fourth loop represents an \"S\" (the first three representing an \"M\") and that there is \"quite a variation\" in this feature, which is otherwise consistent as the following images show:779\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 100:11-101:15 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Charts E and F (Exh. RDE-RP-1).\n\n625.\n\nThere is considerable variation among comparison signatures with respect to this specific feature. Hence, the Tribunal agrees with Mr. Welch that this feature must be attributed to variation. In any event, neither Mr. Radley nor the Claimants have not provided any cogent argument to show that it is a significant difference.780\n\nC-PHB1, para. 321(i).\n\n626.\n\nFifth, Mr. Radley opines that the curvature of the joining stroke bending upwards (point 5 in the image appearing in paragraph 607 above) is \"tighter\" than in the comparison signatures. Mr. Welch concedes that the arch is narrower than in the comparison signatures, but still regards it a variation as it \"goes along with [Mr. Struik\u2019s] handwriting habits\". He emphasizes that, as the illustration below shows, there are similar cuts through the loop into the last upward-down movement: \"There\u2019s just slight variation in the distance, in the width of that are or that connecting stroke\". Therefore, it is not a \"difference which would be suggestive or indicative of another writer\".781\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 215:24-216:25 (Welch); Mr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 32.\n\n627.\n\nMr. Welch appears to agree that the feature is a difference, but opines that it \"goes along with [Mr. Struik\u2019s] handwriting habits\" and is therefore not a significant difference suggestive of forgery. In any event, neither Mr. Radley nor the Claimants asserted that this difference was significant.782 Mr. Radley merely stated that the curvature was *\"tighter\"* than in any comparator, without however providing any additional assessment of writing habits, fine details or internal/external factors that might shed light on why this difference cannot be reasonably explained. While the curvature in the disputed signature appears to be slightly tighter than in K12.1, for instance, the Tribunal notes that undisputed signatures of Mr. Struik show considerable variation with respect to this particular feature. For instance, the curvature is extremely wide in K8.5, whereas there is no curvature at all in K6.3. The Tribunal is therefore not convinced that this difference is significant enough to warrant a conclusion that the signature is a forgery. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts that this feature is a difference, but does not view it as a significant difference suggestive of forgery.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 321(ii).\n\n628.\n\nSixth, Mr. Radley opines that the straight up/down stroke retracing itself (point 6 in the image in paragraph 607 above) is not present in the comparison signatures, which all show a loop. Mr. Welch disagrees that this feature is a difference. He points out that, while there are no comparison signatures where Mr. Struik \"retraces it like that\", the height relations and other characteristics are in line with his handwriting habits.783\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 219:4-22 (Welch).\n\n629.\n\nWhile he appears to agree that the feature is a deviation or difference, albeit not a significant one, Mr. Welch still considers it in line with Mr. Struik\u2019s writing habits. Here again, Mr. Radley did not opine that this difference is significant; nor did the Claimants.784 That said, the Tribunal notes that a similar feature can be observed in K17.13 and to a lesser extent in K12.1. In these two comparison signatures, the up/down strokes do not retrace themselves as in the disputed signature (it is therefore a difference). However, the loop in these examples is much thinner than in other comparator signatures. By comparison, the Tribunal notes that the up/down stroke in the fourth loop discussed further above also shows significant variation, and that Mr. Struik's habit with regard to this \"S\" feature includes simple retraces (e.g. K8.5, K9.1, K.10.3, K12.1), whereas most comparison signatures show a loop (e.g. K3.1, K4.2, K5.2, K6.3, K11.10, K15.1, K17.15) or a triangle-shaped formation (e.g. K7.3, K16.1, K17.13, K18.2). This tends to demonstrate that Mr. Struik has a wide range of handwriting habits when it comes to loop formations. Accordingly, the Tribunal does not consider this feature to be a significant difference that suggests forgery.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 321(iii).\n\n630.\n\nSeventh, Mr. Radley stated that the small kink (point 7 in the image in paragraph 607 above) is more pronounced than in the comparison signatures. It is not as deep nor does it have the same curvature as in K7.3 or K14.2. For Mr. Radley, this is a \"rare feature, but not a true difference\". Mr. Welch agrees that the small kink following the downstroke is not a difference and views it as a variation. He disagrees, however, that it is a \"rare feature\" as Mr. Radley thinks, since the variations are exhibited in the known handwriting samples mentioned by Mr. Radley. The kink in K7.3 and K14.2, so Mr. Welch says, is \"very similar in size and distance relationship\" as can be seen below:785\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 217:1-20 (Welch); Mr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 34.\n\n631.\n\nMr. Picciochi concurs with Mr. Welch regarding this \"trough-like motion\". According to him, the small kink following the \"S\" into an ascending stroke is repeated in the known signatures, although it is not identical every time, as can be seen from the illustration below. However, for Mr. Picciochi, \"the spirit of the movement is there all the time\".786\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 101:16-102:2 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Chart G (Exh. RDE-RP-1).\n\n632.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Mr. Welch\u2019s and Mr. Picciochi\u2019s explanations, especially considering the fact that Mr. Radley conceded that this feature is not a difference.\n\n633.\n\nEighth, Mr. Radley opined that the angularity of the curving stroke following the anticlockwise dome (point 8 in the image in paragraph 607 above) is \"significantly different\" to the other comparison signatures, to the exception of K19.18. Mr. Welch disagreed, finding that the dome-shaped terminal movement in K19.1 for instance was \"very similar in its form, size and construction\" and \"well within Mr. Struik\u2019s range of variation\":787\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 219:23-220:20 (Welch); Mr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 35.\n\n634.\n\nMr. Picciochi generally agreed with Mr. Welch\u2019s conclusions. First, so he testified, while the height and width vary somewhat, the form is essentially the same in all known signatures and it also has an angularity in the left-hand side as is apparent from the illustrations below.788 Second, according to Mr. Picciochi, the \"terminal stroke of this counterclockwise loop does not end abruptly: it flies off the paper and has a nice taper to it. So this means it\u2019s written with speed\".789 Finally, Mr. Picciochi stressed that the terminal dot was also present in the disputed signature of Mr. Struik as is shown below, but that it is difficult to see as it is covered by the stamp.790\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 103:8-18 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Charts I and J (Exh. RDE-RP-1).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 103:19-24 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Chart K (Exh. RDE-RP-1).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 105:7-12 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Chart L (Exh. RDE-RP-1).\n\n635.\n\nOn that basis, Mr. Picciochi reached the conclusion that \"there is strong evidence to support that the questioned Marc Struik signature is consistent with or genuine when compared to the known signatures. Furthermore, there are no fundamental differences that would indicate forgery\".791\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 105:15-19 (Picciochi).\n\n636.\n\nThe Tribunal has carefully assessed the opinion expressed by the experts and does not consider this feature as a significant difference indicating forgery. It is true that there is considerable variation in the angularity of the curving stroke following the counterclockwise dome, but Mr. Radley acknowledged that K19.18 shows a similar angularity and the Tribunal observes that K11.10 also displays some angularity. More importantly, the Tribunal is convinced by the explanations provided by Mr. Picciochi concerning the flying finish and in particular the terminal dot that is aligned with the general direction of the terminal stroke.\n\n637.\n\nFinally, Mr. Radley added that the relative proportions of the height to width of the \"first five elements\" raise doubts as to the authenticity of the disputed signature. According to Mr. Radley, \"the questioned signature fits into a far taller rectangle\" than in the comparison signatures. Mr. Welch disagreed, noting that the same proportion can be found in K14.2 as the following illustration shows.792 Therefore, in Mr. Welch's opinion, this is a variation and not a difference suggestive of another writer.\n\nMr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 37. See also: Tr. (DA), Day 2, 169:2-170:16 (Welch).\n\n638.\n\nMr. Picciochi addressed this issue by assessing the first three loops. According to him, these loops represent the letter \"M\" with a \"garland-type 'M' structure\": \"There is one loop, two loops, three loops, and it has troughs\". For him, the ratio of height and width in R-27 is approximately 0.43 and thus falls within the range of variations of the known signatures. The ratios of the comparison signatures depicted in the chart below are as follows: K12.1 ratio is 0.45; K6.3 ratio is 0.42; K9.1 ratio is 0.46; K3.1 ratio is 0.46; K8.5 ratio is 0.46 and K19.1 ratio is 0.43. Accordingly, this is a similarity for Mr. Picciochi, not a difference.793\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 97:13-98:25 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Chart C (Exh. RDE-RP-1).\n\n639.\n\nThe Claimants objected that Mr. Picciochi had measured the height/width ratio of the first three loops only, instead of the \"full five loops\" as Mr. Radley had done.794 The Tribunal is unconvinced by Mr. Radley's explanations in this respect. Mr. Radley only raised the height/width ratio at the hearing. His report does not mention it. In addition, Mr. Radley provided no assessment of the range of variation of all comparison signatures, neither did he supply a cogent reason for focusing on the first five loops. By contrast, Mr. Picchiochi, who measured the first three loops, explained that these loops relate to the M of Marc, an explanation that the Claimants seemingly accepted. The Claimants did not dispute either that the height/width ratio of the first three loops falls within the range of variation and is not a difference.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 328(iii); Radley's annotations to Welch's slide 37, CDE-RR-1.\n\n640.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal is further persuaded by Mr. Picciochi's analysis of the detail of the handwriting habits. For instance, Mr. Picciochi referred to the relative back slant of the fourth loop, which has an increased slope to the left and is a subtle feature - a \"subconscious characteristic\" - that a forger is unlikely to pick up.795 Similarly, the baseline inclination or slope of the entire signature block goes uphill and is therefore, as Mr. Picciochi said, \"anything that you do approximately the same way and without thought\", or in other words a habit.796\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 99:1-100:10 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Chart D (Exh. RDE-RP-1).\n\nMr. Picciochi's Presentation, Chart D (Exh. RDE-RP-1).\n\n641.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal cannot conclude that the disputed Marc Struik signature is a forgery as the Claimants and Mr. Struik allege. To the contrary, the evidence indicates that it is Mr. Struik who affixed the disputed signature on Exh. R-27.\n\n642.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants allege that Mr. LaPorte\u2019s document examination of Exh. R-27 was \"defective and unscientific\".797 Their criticism concerns the sequencing of the stamp numbers: \"the serial number on R-27 bears no resemblance to the sequencing of the serial numbers on R-25 and R-26 also stamped, apparently, by Tinkiano\".798 They lament that there is no evidence in the record \"as to the significance of the serial numbers the stamps bear on the basis that the serial numbers relate to the stamps\u2019 manufacture (rather than application)\".799 While the Claimants regard this matter as highly significant, they did not cross-examine Mr. Tinkiano on the stamp numbering, nor did they make other submissions, let alone produce evidence, in support of their criticism. In the circumstances, the Tribunal will not speculate on the reasons for the sequencing of the stamps, but to say that there are a number of possible explanations.800 It will rather rely on Mr. LaPorte\u2019s examination which revealed no alteration of the document that could indicate fraud.\n\nC-PHB1, p. 126.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 312.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 312.\n\nIncluding that the numbers may relate to the manufacturing as well as to the application or inadvertance by officials using the stamps.\n\n643.\n\nThe Claimants have also argued that it would be \"inconceivable\" that Mr. Struik would sign a document where the word \"Resources\" in BSGR\u2019s name is spelled with two instead of one \"s\". This argument was raised for the first time in the post-hearing briefs and Mr. Struik did not mention it in his evidence. As Exh. R-27 is drafted in French, it does not appear \"inconceivable\" to the Tribunal that the word \"Resources\" was mistakenly spelled with two \"s\" like in French. In light of the other evidence, this discrepancy is insufficient to establish that the document was forged.\n\n644.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal finds that Exh. R-27 and Mr. Struik\u2019s signature on this document are authentic.\n\n(f) Exhibit R-28\n----------------\n\n(i) Description of the document\n-------------------------------\n\n645.\n\nExh. R-28 is a single page document which is entitled *\"contrat de commission* and concluded between BSG Resources and Matinda. There is a mention in print that the document was signed in Conakry on 27 February 2008. The disputed signature of Asher Avidan appears on the bottom left, together with a BSGR Guinea stamp with the words *\"Le Directeur des Op\u00e9rations* and the printed text \"Mr AVIDAN ASHER\" further below. What appears to be the signature of Ms. Tour\u00e9 appears on the bottom right.\n\n(ii) Experts\u2019 findings\n----------------------\n\n646.\n\nThe Experts\u2019 found that there was \"no evidence of text alteration, text addition, or other irregularities to indicate that R-28 was fraudulently produced\".801 Hence, they concluded that \"Avidan Asher wrote the disputed Avidan Asher signatures on R-28 and R-29\".802 In their responses to the Claimants\u2019 questions, they further specified that \"[t]here is no evidence of any differences that would suggest someone other than Asher Avidan signed the document\".803\n\nFinal Report, p. 110.\n\nFinal Report, p. 9.\n\nFinal Report, Annex L, Response to BSGR comments on the Preliminary Report, para 43-44.\n\n647.\n\nAccording to the Final Report, the disputed signature of Mr. Avidan reveals \"numerous significant similarities with the comparison signatures and there is \"evidence of fluency with good line quality, pen pressure variation, hooks, and tapered strokes\"; thus, there is \"no evidence of distortion commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries\".804 Although this is a stylistic signature lacking readable and well-formed characters, the similarities observed include height relations, proportions, spatial relations, hooks, tapered strokes, retraces and pen drags.805\n\nFinal Report, para. 149.\n\nFinal Report, para. 156.\n\n648.\n\nMr. Welch \"completely disagrees\" with Mr. Radley\u2019s identification of differences.806 The alignment of the right-hand side of the upper and lower loops is part of the handwriting habits and falls within the range of variation. So does the curve of the dome. While the loop size is not always the same, the movement is similar and is thus not a difference suggestive of a forgery. Finally, the right-angled stroke on the top right hand corner is a feature that fits within the range of variation.\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 186:20-21, 193:6-10, 196:13-15 (Welch).\n\n(iii) Comments of the Party-appointed experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n649.\n\nMr. Radley regards the signature of Asher Avidan as a \"basic signature\".807 He disagrees with the conclusion of the Experts and identifies the following four differences:808\n\nRadley Report, p. 85.\n\nRadley Report, p. 62. The image is reproduced from Mr. Radley's report. It does not identify point (iv), which corresponds to the \"L\" shaped line on the top right hand corner of the signature and has been identified by the Tribunal with a green arrow.\n\n650.\n\nAccording to Mr. Radley's report,809 Point (i) in the image above shows that the vertical line from the right-hand side of the upper loop is in line with the lower loop of the \"S\" shape; a difference not seen in any of the comparison signatures. Point (ii) refers to the dome at the end of the long horizontal stroke that is \"very rounded with a relatively large radius of curvature\", whereas the change of direction is \"fairly sharp\" in the comparison signatures. Point (iii) shows that there is no significant loop but a sideways \"V\" shape when compared to the clockwise loop with an extended downward tail in the comparison signatures. Finally, at point (iv) there is a deliberate change of direction in the \"L\" shaped line towards the top right hand corner of the signature. However, because there is \"quite a variable structure\" in all known signatures, Mr. Radley attaches \"little significance\" to this fourth element.\n\nRadley Report, paras. 291-294.\n\n651.\n\nIn sum, Mr. Radley opines that, while there are \"clear, demonstrable differences\", there is \"no clear evidence one way or the other\".810 In other words, the evidence is \"inconclusive\" as to whether Avidan signed this document.\n\nRadley Report, paras. 304-305.\n\n652.\n\nMr. Picciochi concurs with Mr. Welch's conclusion and rejects the proposition that the dissimilarities identified by Mr. Radley are differences, let alone significant differences. For him, \"the general motion [in Asher Avidan's signature] is very complex\".811\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 110:14-15 (Picciochi).\n\n653.\n\nAccording to Mr. Picciochi, known writings of Mr. Avidan show dissimilarities comparable to those identified by Mr. Radley, which rules out another writer. Specifically, the structure in the lower left hand corner of the signature in Exh. R-28 (point (iii)) is a \"very similar motion\" as the \"9\"-shaped structure in R-29.812 The known signatures show \"some variation\" in respect of the upper-right tick mark (point (iv)). Therefore, this particular mark also falls within \"the known writing variation\".813 The vertical alignment of the two main loops (point (i)) is \"not a fundamental difference because it is found in known writings\".814 Finally, the terminal stroke of the last loop (point (ii)), which ends downward vertically in Exh. R-28 and to the right in Exh. R-29, is not a \"fundamental difference\" either, since in some known signatures the terminal stroke ends downward (like Exh. R-28), others to the left, and yet others to the right (like Exh. R-29).815\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 110:19-111:9 (Picciochi). See also: Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Asher Avidan, Chart B (Exh. RDE-RP-2).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 111:9-19 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Asher Avidan, Chart C (Exh. RDE-RP-2).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 111:20-112:10 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Asher Avidan, Chart D (Exh. RDE-RP-2).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 112:11-25 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Asher Avidan, Chart E (Exh. RDE-RP-2).\n\n654.\n\nOn this basis, Mr. Picciochi concludes that \"the known writing and the questioned writing [...] were written by the same person\".816 He is also of the opinion that there are \"[n]o fundamental differences\" between the questioned and known writings and that \"[a]nything that may look dissimilar is attributed to natural variation\".817\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 113:2-8 (Picciochi).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 112:17-18 and 113:8-11 (Picciochi).\n\n(iv) Parties' positions\n-----------------------\n\n655.\n\nThe Claimants criticize Mr. Welch for dismissing all the differences identified by Mr. Radley as variations, while at the same time conceding that these \"variations\" fall outside the range of variation. Thus, for instance, Mr. Welch resorted to a \"poor\" or \"appalling quality copy\" in K23.3 to dismiss the fourth difference, which \"is indicative of the weakness of his argument\".818\n\nC-PHB1, para. 322, n. 664.\n\n656.\n\nThe Claimants further state that Mr. Avidan saw versions of these contracts, i.e. the contracts appearing in Exh. R-28 and Exh. R-29, during a blackmail attempt in 2009. The versions which he then saw correspond to Exh. C-112 and Exh. C-113 and display \"fundamental differences\".819 For example, the surname appears before the first name (i.e. Avidan Asher) in both the heading and signature blocks, which is not the case of the comparison documents.820 Moreover, Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s signature is above the printed name in Exh. R-28, when it is placed below in Exh. C-112.821\n\nC-PHB1, para. 274(ii).\n\nC-PHB1, para. 274(i).\n\nC-PHB1, para. 274(ii).\n\n657.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Experts\u2019 findings that Mr. Avidan signed Exh. R-28 and that the document is authentic.\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n658.\n\nExh. R-28 is another document which the Claimants allege to be forged.822 The Claimants rely on Mr. Avidan\u2019s testimony, according to which \"he convincingly and honestly denied having signed the contract [...]\".823 The Claimants\u2019 expert, however, has not corroborated the Claimants\u2019 allegation. For Mr. Radley the evidence is \"inconclusive\" as to the authenticity of Mr. Avidan\u2019s signature. On this basis, the Tribunal could end its analysis here with the finding that the Claimants have not discharged their burden to prove their allegation of forgery. For the sake of completeness and because the Experts and the Parties have examined and debated the authenticity of Exh. R-28 from a forensic point of view, the Tribunal will briefly review the four \"differences\" identified by Mr. Radley.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 31; C-PHB1, paras. 272, 335-336.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 274(iii).\n\n659.\n\nThe following image depicts the disputed Asher Avidan signature in Exhibit R-28:824\n\nFinal Report, p. 113.\n\n660.\n\nThe known comparison signatures of Mr. Avidan as compiled by the Experts are found below:825\n\nFinal Report, p. 116.\n\n661.\n\nMr. Radley first argued that the vertical alignment of the right-hand side of the upper loop with the lower loop of the \"S\" shape (point (i)) is not found in the comparison signatures. Mr. Welch responded that this alignment is part of Mr. Avidan\u2019s handwriting habits, which is shown by K13.2 and K22.826\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 196:24-197:13 (Welch); Mr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 44.\n\n662.\n\nMr. Picciochi agreed with Mr. Radley that most of the known signatures have a slanted, not a vertical line, including the signature in Exh. R-29.827 However, he also agreed with Mr. Welch that a nearly vertical line appears in K13.2 and K22.1. Looking at the following comparators, the Tribunal is of the view that this feature is within the range of variation of Mr. Avidan\u2019s signing habits:\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 111:20-112:10 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Asher Avidan, Chart D (Exh. RDE-RP-2).\n\n663.\n\nMr. Radley further argued that the rounded curved dome in Exh. R-28 (point (ii)) contrasts with the \"fairly sharp\" change of direction in the undisputed signatures. Mr. Welch disagreed and opined that the curve of the dome is a variation, not a difference when assessed with comparison signatures:828\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 197:14-198:13 (Welch); Mr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 46.\n\n664.\n\nMr. Picciochi did not see any \"fundamental difference\" either. He supported his view by pointing to the terminal stroke of the curved dome. He observed that such stroke displayed a wide range, sometimes ending downward (like Exh. R-28 or K19.18), other times to the left (like K13.4), and yet others to the right (like Exh. R-29 or CWS-10.5K30.2), as illustrated below:829\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 112:11-25 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Asher Avidan, Chart E (Exh. RDE-RP-2).\n\n665.\n\nHere again, the Tribunal is not convinced that this feature constitutes a difference, even less a significant difference indicating a forgery. Mr. Radley merely asserted that \"[g]enerally, the change of direction is fairly sharp in the known writings\". However, he provided no analysis of or references to comparison signatures. By contrast, Mr. Welch pointed to comparison signatures displaying rounded domes like in Exh. R-28 without a sharp change in direction. Accordingly, the Tribunal regards this feature as a variation and not a difference.\n\n666.\n\nThird, Mr. Radley pointed to the absence of the clockwise loop beneath the main portion of the signature (point (iii)). Mr. Welch partly agreed with Mr. Radley, insofar as the loop size is not always the same. He opined, however, that the movement was similar and thus not a difference pointing to another writer. He noted that Mr. Avidan had a \"vast range of variation in how he makes that particular movement\", as K22 and K20.61 show:830\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 198:15-199:24 (Welch); Mr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 48.\n\n667.\n\nFor Mr. Picciochi, the structure in the lower left hand corner of the signature in Exh. R-28 is a \"very similar motion\" as the 9-shaped structure in Exh. R-29.831\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 110:19-111:9 (Picciochi). See also: Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Asher Avidan, Chart B (Exh. RDE-RP-2).\n\n668.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider that this feature qualifies as a significant difference suggesting forgery. While it tends to agree with Mr. Radley that this feature falls outside the observed range of variation in Mr. Avidan's handwriting, it also takes into account Mr. Welch's explanations on the range of movements and, more importantly, the fact that Mr. Radley regarded the evidence as inconclusive.\n\n669.\n\nFinally, Mr. Radley noted that the right-angled stroke on the top right hand corner (point (iv)) was different from the rest of the known signatures. Mr. Welch did not agree that this feature was a difference, as it fits within the range of variation illustrated below:832\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 199:25-201:17 (Welch); Mr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 50.\n\n670.\n\nMr. Picciochi agreed that the known signatures show \"some variation\" in respect of the upper-right tick mark, but stressed that such mark also falls within known writing variation:833\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 111:9-19 (Picciochi); Mr. Picciochi's Presentation, Asher Avidan, Chart C (Exh. RDE-RP-2).\n\n671.\n\nFor the Tribunal, this feature is again not a significant difference indicative of a forgery. Indeed, Mr. Radley recognized that Mr. Avidan\u2019s signatures displayed \"quite a variable structure\" and attributed \"little significance\" to his observation on the right-angled stroke. Accordingly, he acknowledged that this feature was not a significant difference suggesting a forgery.834\n\nRadley Report, para. 294.\n\n672.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Exh. R-28 and more specifically Mr. Avidan\u2019s signature on this document are authentic.\n\n(g) Exhibit R-29\n----------------\n\n(i) Description of document\n---------------------------\n\n673.\n\nExh. R-29 is a single page document that bears the title *\"protocole d\u2019accord\u2019* and is entered into by BSR Resources Guin\u00e9e and Matinda. There is a mention in print that the document was signed in Conakry on 28 February 2008. The disputed signature of Asher Avidan appears on the bottom left, together with a BSGR Guinea stamp with the words *\"Le Directeur des Op\u00e9rations* and the printed text *\"Monsieur AVIDAN ASHER\"* further below. What appears to be the signature of Ms. Tour\u00e9 is located on the bottom right.\n\n(ii) Experts\u2019 findings\n----------------------\n\n674.\n\nThe Experts found that \"[t]here is no evidence of text alteration, text addition, or other irregularities to indicate that R-29 was fraudulently produced\"835 and conclude that: \"Avidan Asher wrote the disputed Avidan Asher signatures on R-28 and R-29\".836\n\nFinal Report, p. 120.\n\nFinal Report, p. 9.\n\n675.\n\nWith respect to the document, Mr. LaPorte reaches the same conclusions as with Exh. R-28, except that the examination revealed a transfer of ink/toner on the front of Exh. R-29, but did not reveal the source of such transfer.837\n\nFinal Report, para. 191.\n\n676.\n\nAs regards the signature of Asher Avidan, Mr. Welch comes to an identical conclusion as for Exh. R-28.\n\n(iii) Comments of the Party-appointed experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n677.\n\nIn addition to the differences identified in the disputed signature in Exh. R-28, which are also present in Exh. R-29, Mr. Radley points to three alleged differences apparent only in Exh. R-29:\n\nR-29 (Avidan Asher)\n\n678.\n\nFirst, Mr. Radley stated that the irregular clockwise bend in the diagonal of the \"S\" shape (point i) is not seen in the comparison signatures.838 Second, he explained that the written horizontal dash in the looped 9-shaped element (point ii) is a \"waved line\" and not as smooth and tapered as in the comparison signatures.839 In addition, this feature shows a very slight downward hook.840 Third, the comparison signatures do not show the \"pen lifting motion\" at the end of the \"S\" shaped terminal loop (point iii).841 Mr. Radley added that the terminal strokes in the disputed Avidan signature show differences, namely \"angular bends at the end in an irregular fashion\".842\n\nRadley Report, para. 297.\n\nRadley Report, para. 298.\n\nRadley Report, para. 299.\n\nRadley Report, para. 300.\n\nRadley Report, para. 303.\n\n679.\n\nAs was the case with Exh. R-28, Mr. Picciochi does not \"support the proposition that there are fundamental differences\" between the disputed Asher Avidan signature in Exh. R-29 and the known writings,843 and finds that \"[a]nything that may look dissimilar is attributed to natural variation\".844\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 113:8-10 (Picciochi).\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 113:10-11 (Picciochi).\n\n(iv) Parties' positions\n-----------------------\n\n680.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Exh. R-29 is a forgery, as Mr. Avidan testified.845 The Claimants essentially reiterate the same arguments as for Exh. R-28. Additionally, they point out that Mr. Welch only relied on \"two poor (and distorted) copies\" of K22 and K12.3 to discard Mr. Radley\u2019s comments on the \"elongated anticlockwise curve shape\" (point (iii)).846 In fact, so the Claimants say, Mr. Welch accepted that this feature was \"not exactly the same\" when comparing Exh. R-29 to K22 or K12.3.847\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 31; C-PHB1, paras. 272, 335-336.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 322, n. 664.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 322, n. 664.\n\n681.\n\nThe Respondent agrees with the Experts\u2019 findings that Mr. Avidan signed Exh. R-29 and that the document is authentic.\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n682.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 allegation that Exh. R-29 is forged.848 As with Exh. R-28, the Claimants in particular rely on Mr. Avidan\u2019s testimony that he did not sign that document.849 For essentially the same reasons as those set out in connection with Exh. R-28, the Tribunal does not consider that Exh. R-29 is a forgery. Indeed, Mr. Radley did not support the Claimants\u2019 case when he called the evidence \"inconclusive\". While the Tribunal could thus end the inquiry here, it will nevertheless briefly examine the three \"differences\" identified by Mr. Radley for the sake of completeness.\n\nSee, for instance, C-PHB1, paras. 272, 335-336.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 274(iii).\n\n683.\n\nThe following image shows the signature of Mr. Avidan in Exhibit R-29:850\n\nFinal Report, p. 122.\n\n684.\n\nThe comparison signatures of Mr. Avidan are reproduced in connection with the discussion of Exh. R-28 at paragraph 660 above.\n\n685.\n\nThe first \"difference\" identified by Mr. Radley relates to the clockwise bend in the diagonal of the S shape. Mr. Welch responded that this feature was not a difference, since such variation is exhibited in the known signatures. The Tribunal agrees relying especially on K13.2:851\n\nMr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 53.\n\n686.\n\nIn respect of the Claimants' argument that Mr. Welch relied on \"two poor (and distorted) copies\" as comparison material, the Tribunal notes that the Experts deemed the comparison samples sufficient for purposes of their examination.852 More importantly, Mr. Radley concluded his assessment by stating that there was no clear evidence pointing in one or the other direction.853\n\nFinal Report, para. 170.\n\nRadley Report, para. 305.\n\n687.\n\nThe second \"difference\" identified by Mr. Radley relates to the horizontal dash in the looped 9-shaped element (point (ii)). For him, this \"waved line\" is not executed with the same smooth movement as in the comparison signatures.854 In addition, so he says, the \"very slight downward hook\" is dissimilar to the comparison signatures.855 These are not differences according to Mr. Welch, but features that \"go to genuineness\" and fall within the scope of variation.856\n\nRadley Report, para. 298.\n\nRadley Report, para. 299.\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 203:6-205:6 (Welch); Mr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 55.\n\n688.\n\nHere again, the Tribunal starts by observing that Mr. Radley did not regard this second dissimilarity as a significant difference. Moreover, Mr. Welch convincingly rebutted Mr. Radley\u2019s arguments. Indeed, the \"very slight downward hook\" belongs to the ending of the 9-shaped element, not to the \"waved line\", as Mr. Radley seemed to suggest. The downward hook is found in CWS-10.5, K13.2, K13.4 and K20.59:857\n\nMr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 55.\n\n689.\n\nThe third difference identified by Mr. Radley relates to the horizontal direction of the terminal loop in the S shape (point (iii)).858 Mr. Welch disagrees with Mr. Radley\u2019s conclusion, saying that this \"characteristic is well within the handwriting habits and variation of Mr. Asher\".859\n\nRadley Report, paras. 300-301.\n\nTr. (DA), Day 2, 209:2-4 (Welch).\n\n690.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with Mr. Welch that this feature falls within the range of variation of Mr. Avidan\u2019s handwriting. A similar feature can be found in K-19.1 or, as depicted below, in K-20.59:860\n\nMr. Welch's Presentation, Slide 57.\n\n691.\n\nFinally, it is noteworthy that Mr. Radley did not qualify this feature as a significant difference. On this basis, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that Mr. Avidan wrote the disputed signature in Exh. R-29 and that such document is authentic.\n\n(h) Exhibit R-30\n----------------\n\n(i) Description of document\n---------------------------\n\n692.\n\nExh. R-30 is an untitled document that bears the disputed signatures of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Mr. Noy from Pentler Holdings Ltd. There is a printed mention that the document was signed in Freetown. The document also bears a handwritten date \"8-7-2010\" and there is a \"Pentler Holdings Ltd\" stamp above the disputed signature of Mr. Noy.\n\n(ii) Experts\u2019 findings\n----------------------\n\n693.\n\nThe Experts opined with respect to Exh. R-30: \"there [was] no evidence of text alteration, text addition, or other irregularities to indicate that R-30 was fraudulently produced\". They further found that there was evidence indicating that \"R-30 and DOC C may have been attached to each other at one time\".861\n\nFinal Report, p. 129.\n\n694.\n\nAbout Ms. Tour\u00e9's signature, the Experts concluded that \"[t]here are indications that the Mamadie Toure signatures on R-24, R-27 through R-32, R-269, R-346.2, DOC B, and DOC C may have all been written by the same person\".862\n\nFinal Report, p. 9.\n\n695.\n\nIn relation to Mr. Noy's signature, the Experts found that \"[a]lthough no known comparison samples were submitted for comparison with the remaining disputed signatures, no evidence or characteristics commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries were observed\".863\n\nFinal Report, p. 9.\n\n(iii) Comments of the Party-appointed experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n696.\n\nMr. Radley criticizes the Experts' failure to address alternative propositions. For him, they could equally have concluded that there was \"no positive, demonstrable evidence to show that R30 is authentic and was produced on the date indicated\".864 While Mr. Radley agrees that the staining pattern indicates that Exh. R-30 and DOC C \"were probably in contact one with another\", he finds this observation \"irrelevant\", since one cannot determine at what point in time the staining occurred.865\n\nRadley Report, para. 153.\n\nRadley Report, para. 154.\n\n697.\n\nMessrs. Aginsky and Picciochi did not specifically address the authenticity of Exh. R-30.\n\n(iv) Parties' positions\n-----------------------\n\n698.\n\nThe Claimants allege that Exh. R-30 is a forgery.866 According to them, \"one of the (genuine) 3 August 2010 contracts has been modified to refer to the Simandou project, thereby implicating BSGR\". In addition, the Experts had no original for inspection and they could therefore not conduct the majority of the relevant tests. Consequently, Mr. LaPorte could not have reached a conclusion of \"no evidence\" of fraud. Finally, so the Claimants, Mr. Welch acknowledged that his role was \"limited\" due to the absence of comparison signatures for Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Mr. Noy.867\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 30; C-PHB1, para. 283\n\nC-PHB1, para. 283.\n\n699.\n\nThe Respondent concurs with the Experts' conclusions, submitting that this document is authentic.\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n700.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that limited examinations were conducted on this document, since the Experts were only provided with a digital image .pdf file. In spite of the limited materials, Mr. Welch conducted some handwriting examinations and found \"evidence of fluency with variation in the line width, hooks, and tapered strokes\". On that basis, Mr. Welch found \"no evidence of distortion commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries\".868 However, for lack of comparators, he did not undertake a comparison of signatures.\n\nFinal Report, para. 196.\n\n701.\n\nOn this basis, the Tribunal finds it difficult to draw a definite conclusion from the forensic examination. This being so, it recalls that Mr. Noy did concede in the LCIA Arbitration that he had concluded contracts with Ms. Tour\u00e9. Taking this admission into account as well as the (limited) results of the forensic examination, the Tribunal comes to the conclusion that there is no evidence on record showing that Exh. R-30 is a forgery and the Tribunal will therefore treat this document as authentic.\n\n(i) Exhibit R-31\n----------------\n\n(i) Description of document\n---------------------------\n\n702.\n\nExh. R-31 is an untitled two-page document. Both pages are dated 3 August 2010 and contain the same content with the same formatting. There is a mention in print that the documents were signed in Freetown and both pages contain the handwritten date of \"03.08.2010\". The signatures of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Mr. Noy appear at the bottom left of both pages. The signature of Mr. Pabs-Garnon appears at the bottom right of both pages. The documents contain two stamps; the first on the bottom left reads \"PENTLER HOLDINGS LTD\" and the second on the bottom right bears the name \"Editayo Pabs-Garnon\".\n\n(ii) Experts\u2019 findings\n----------------------\n\n703.\n\nThe Experts found \"no evidence of text alteration, text addition, or other irregularities to indicate that the R-31 documents were fraudulently produced\".869\n\nFinal Report, p. 134.\n\n704.\n\nThe handwriting examination revealed \"evidence of fluency with good line quality, pen pressure variation, hooks, and tapered strokes\". On this basis, the Experts concluded that there was \"no evidence of distortion commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries\".870 However, absent known signatures/initials for Mamadie Tour\u00e9, Michael Noy and Editayo Pabs-Garnon, no comparison could be conducted.\n\nFinal Report, para. 208.\n\n705.\n\nAs for the document examination, it revealed that Exh. R-31.2 was above Exh. R-31.1 \"when the date, Michael Noy, and Editayo Pabs-Garnon signatures were written on R-31.2\".871 In addition, Exh. R-31.1 was above Exh. R-31.2 \"when the date and Mamadie Toure signature was written on R-31.1\".872 Finally, \"on the basis of the unsourced date, Michael Noy and Editayo Pabs-Garnon signatures impressed into R-31.2, the evidence reveals that another original copy of R-31 or some other document, was dated and signed in the name of Michael Noy and Editayo Pabs-Garnon while on top of R-31.2\".873 The document assessment also revealed some ink/toner transfer on the back of both pages of Exh. R-31, the source of which was not determined. Further, the evidence indicated that Exh. R-31.2 was placed on Exh. R-31.1 \"shortly after the Pentler Holdings LTD stamp was placed on the document or some other document with a similar stamp\".874\n\nFinal Report, para. 212.\n\nFinal Report, para. 212.\n\nFinal Report, para. 212.\n\nFinal Report, para. 214.\n\n(iii) Comments of the Party-appointed experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n706.\n\nMr. Radley takes issue with the Experts' failure to address alternative propositions. In his opinion, they could as well have reached the conclusion that there was \"no positive, demonstrable evidence to show that R31 is authentic and was produced on the date indicated\".875 While Mr. Radley concurs that the examinations \"support a hypothesis that the two pages of R31 were created at one point in time\", he also insists that they provide no positive evidence of the documents' authenticity and the date of their production.876\n\nRadley Report, para. 155.\n\nRadley Report, para. 156.\n\n707.\n\nThe Respondent's experts did not specifically comment on Exh. R-31, but generally supported the Experts' findings.\n\n(iv) Parties' positions\n-----------------------\n\n708.\n\nThe Claimants \"cannot take a position on [the documents'] authenticity\", but raise concerns regarding the \"very confusing\" terms of this contract and add that \"the payments apparently due\" under this contract do \"not add up to the USD 5 million which Guinea claims\".877\n\nC-PHB1, para. 284.\n\n709.\n\nThe Respondent generally argue that the document is authentic and that the Claimants have not shown that it is forged.\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n710.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants have not taken a position on the authenticity of Exh. R-31. In other words, they have not alleged forgery, and correctly so as there is no evidence on record to this effect. The Tribunal is aware that Mr. Welch only conducted limited handwriting examinations due to the absence of comparison signatures for Ms. Tour\u00e9, Mr. Noy and Mr. Pabs-Garnon. However, the Tribunal recalls that Mr. Noy conceded in the LCIA Arbitration that he did enter into contracts with Ms. Tour\u00e9.878\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Parties have not addressed the topics of indentation and ink/toner transfer raised by Mr. LaPorte and agrees that nothing can be gained from these subjects for purposes of authenticity.\n\n711.\n\nIn sum, there is no evidence establishing that Exh. R-31 is a forgery and the Tribunal will therefore treat it as authentic.\n\n(j) Exh. R-32\n-------------\n\n(i) Description of document\n---------------------------\n\n712.\n\nExh. R-32 is a two-page document containing a contract concluded between Pentler Holdings Ltd, Matinda & Co. Ltd and Ms. Tour\u00e9. The bottom of the first page contains the initials MT and M.N. The document is undated, but there is a mention in printed text on the second page that the document was signed in Freetown. The signature of Ms. Tour\u00e9 appears on the bottom left of the second page and the signature of Mr. Noy appears on the bottom right of the second page. The signature of Mr. Pabs-Garnon appears below the signature of Ms. Tour\u00e9, together with a stamp bearing the name \"Editayo Pabs-Garnon\".\n\n(ii) Experts' findings\n----------------------\n\n713.\n\nThe Experts concluded: \"page 2 of R-32 was not originally attached to page 1 of R-32\". According to them, there is evidence that \"page 1 from R-32 was originally fastened to DOC B; and page 2 from R-32 was originally fastened to DOC A\". They also found that there was no evidence to indicate that the Exh. R-32, DOC A, and DOC B were fraudulently prepared\".879\n\nFinal Report, p. 144.\n\n714.\n\nWith respect to the document examination, the staple holes in the top left corner on page 1 of Exh. R-32 are not consistently aligned with page 2, but are aligned with DOC B. This is corroborated by a crease (fold line) positioned in the same place on page 1 of Exh. R-32 and DOC B.880 Similarly, the staple holes on page 2 of Exh. R-32 are aligned with DOC A, in addition to a tan colored stain that is present on both documents.881 The indentation examinations revealed that DOC B was above page 1 of Exh. R-32 when Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s signature was written on DOC B and page 2 of Exh. R-32 was above page 1 of Exh. R-32 when the signature of Mr. Pabs-Garnon was written on page 2 of Exh. R-32. Moreover, DOC A was above page 2 of Exh. R-32 when the initials M.T. and M.N. were written on DOC A.882 At the Authenticity Hearing, Mr. LaPorte testified that \"had we not been able to associate document A and document B with Exh. R-32, that would have been evidence that that document could have potentially been fraudulent\".883\n\nFinal Report, para. 216.\n\nFinal Report, para. 217.\n\nFinal Report, para. 228.\n\nTr. (DA), Day 1, 41:17-20 (LaPorte).\n\n715.\n\nTurning to the handwriting examination, for the Experts, the signatures \"reveal evidence of fluency with good line quality, pen pressure variation, hooks, and tapered strokes\", thus showing no evidence of \"distortion commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries\".884 Since no known signatures/initials were available, no comparison was conducted for the signatures of Ms. Tour\u00e9, Mr. Noy and Mr. Pabs-Garnon.885\n\nFinal Report, para. 224.\n\nFinaly Report, para. 225.\n\n(iii) Comments of the Party-appointed experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n716.\n\nMr. Radley agrees that page 2 of Exh. R-32 was originally fastened to DOC A and page 1 to DOC B. According to him, this is \"most likely\" the result of a \"mix up\" or confusion.886 According to him, the other \"limited examinations\" \"take the matter no further forward\" towards determining the documents\u2019 authenticity or their date of production.887\n\nRadley Report, para. 158.\n\nRadley Report, para. 159.\n\n717.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s experts did not specifically comment on Exh. R-32, but generally supported the Experts\u2019 findings.\n\n(iv) Parties\u2019 positions\n-----------------------\n\n718.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Exh. R-32 is part of a \"series of confusing documents\" and that they \"cannot take a position on their authenticity\".\n\n719.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the document is authentic and that the Claimants have not proven that it is forged.\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n720.\n\nHere again, the Claimants take no position on the authenticity of the document under examination. Accordingly, they do not allege that Exh. R-32 is forged. The Tribunal considers that the Claimants are right not to make such allegation as nothing in the record proves the existence of a forgery. This observation is reinforced if one keeps in mind that Mr. Noy admitted [REDACTED] that he had concluded contracts with Ms. Tour\u00e9.888\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 32; [REDACTED]\n\n721.\n\nIn sum, there is no evidence to demonstrate that Exh. R-32 is a forgery and the Tribunal will therefore consider that it is authentic.\n\n(k) Exh. R-269\n--------------\n\n(i) Description of document\n---------------------------\n\n722.\n\nExh. R-269 is a document entitled \"Attestation\", which is signed by Ms. Tour\u00e9. The place and date are printed and indicate Freetown and 2 August 2009. In addition, the document states that Messrs. Abdoulaye Ciss\u00e9 and Issiaga Bangoura signed the document as witnesses.\n\n(ii) Experts' findings\n----------------------\n\n723.\n\nThe Experts found \"no evidence of page substitution, text alteration, text addition or other irregularities to indicate that R-269 was fraudulently produced\".889\n\nFinal Report, p. 159.\n\n724.\n\nThe document examinations revealed two sets of staple holes that are consistently aligned. One set of staple holes exhibits rust, thus making it \"more likely the documents were once stapled together several years ago and not stapled more recently\".890 Further, they noted that inkjet technology was used to print the text.891\n\nFinal Report, para. 232.\n\nFinal Report, para. 234.\n\n725.\n\nWith respect to the handwriting examinations, the signatures of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Mr. Ciss\u00e9 \"reveal evidence of fluency with good line quality, pen pressure variation, hooks, and tapered strokes\".892 The signature of Mr. Bangoura \"likewise bears evidence of fluency especially with respect to the non-horizontal movements which have smooth even lines with tapered strokes and pen pressure variation\".893 On that basis, the Experts concluded that there was \"no evidence of distortion commonly associated with traced or simulated forgeries\".894 However, as no comparators were available, Mr. Welch performed no comparison analysis.895\n\nFinal Report, para. 238.\n\nFinal Report, para. 238.\n\nFinal Report, para. 238.\n\nFinal Report, para. 239.\n\n(iii) Comments of the Party-appointed experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n726.\n\nMr. Radley opines that the Experts could equally have concluded that no evidence showed that Exh. R-269 was authentic. The \"quite extensive\" rust marks suggest that the document was stapled \"for a fair period of time\", although Mr. Radley cannot estimate how long because of the accelerated oxidation in humid climates and the absence of information on the document's storage.896 The fact that inkjet technology was used \"does not necessarily mean\" that an office machine was used.\n\nRadley Report, paras. 160-161.\n\n727.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s experts did not specifically comment on Exh. R-269, but supported the Experts\u2019 findings in general terms.\n\n(iv) Parties\u2019 positions\n-----------------------\n\n728.\n\nThe Claimants initially claimed that Exh. R-269 was a forgery. In their Post-Hearing Brief, they then argued that the document may be \"genuine\", but that its content was \"false\".897 For the Claimants, Ms. Tour\u00e9 created this document \"for illegitimate means\". In addition, the Claimants observe that Mr. Welch merely found \"indications\" that Ms. Tour\u00e9 signed this document. They also note that there is no information on the provenance of this document and that Guinea \"was unable to explain how the FBI obtained an *'original\u2019* version\".898 Finally, the Claimants draw attention to the testimony of Messrs. Avidan and Struik according to which they first heard of this document in the context of Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s blackmail attempts, but \"did not see a copy until these proceedings\".899\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 279 and 281.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 281 (Emphasis in the original).\n\nC-PHB1, para. 281.\n\n729.\n\nThe Respondent submits in general terms that the document is authentic and that the Claimants have not established that it is forged.\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n730.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Claimants no longer allege that the document is forged. They assert now that Ms. Tour\u00e9 created the document for illegitimate purposes and that the content does not reflect the truth. In other words, the Claimants accept that Ms. Tour\u00e9 signed Exh. R-269. As a result, the authenticity of the document is not at issue. It will remain for the Tribunal to assess the probative value of the document in the analysis of Guinea\u2019s allegations of corruption.\n\n(l) Exh. R-346\n--------------\n\n(i) Description of document\n---------------------------\n\n731.\n\nExh. R-346 is a two-page document that bears the initials N.M. and M.T. on the first page and the disputed signatures of Ms. Tour\u00e9, Mr. Noy and Mr. Editayo Pabs-Garnon. There is an indication in print that the document was signed in Freetown and it bears the handwritten date of \"03-08-2010\".\n\n(ii) Experts' findings\n----------------------\n\n732.\n\nLike for many other documents discussed above, the Experts found \"no evidence of text alteration, text addition, or other irregularities to indicate that R-346 was fraudulently produced\".900\n\nFinal Report, p. 172.\n\n733.\n\nExh. R-346 is a digital image .pdf file, with an image of poor quality, which limited the findings. The Experts identified \"some limited characteristics that may indicate evidence of fluency in the initials/signatures\", but added that this was \"far from conclusive\".901\n\nFinal Report, para. 249.\n\n(iii) Comments of the Party-appointed experts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n734.\n\nFor Mr. Radley, the Experts could equally have concluded that there was no evidence of authenticity,902 considering that their comments \"do not contribute any meaningful evidence with respect to the authenticity of the document or its date of production\".903\n\nRadley Report, para. 165.\n\nRadley Report, para. 167.\n\n735.\n\nThe Respondent's experts did not specifically comment on Exh. R-346, but generally supported the Experts' findings.\n\n(iv) Parties' positions\n-----------------------\n\n736.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Exh. R-346 is part of a \"series of confusing documents\" and that they \"cannot take a position on their authenticity\".\n\n737.\n\nThe Respondent generally argues that the document is authentic and that the Claimants have not established the evidence of a forgery.\n\n(v) Discussion\n--------------\n\n738.\n\nHere, the Claimants have taken no position on authenticity, which means that they make no allegation of forgery. There is indeed no evidence on record to this effect and the Tribunal recalls that Mr. Noy [REDACTED] that he had signed contracts with Ms. Tour\u00e9.\n\n739.\n\nWhile it is true that the available digital image .pdf file allowed only for limited examinations, it remains that there is no proof that this document is forged.\n\n740.\n\nIn this context, the Tribunal notes that the content of Exh. R-346 appears largely identical with the one of Exh. R-32. The main difference is that the third clause on page 1 of Exh. R-32 provides for compensation in an amount of USD 3.1 million whereas such compensation amounts to USD 5.5 million in Exh. R-346. A second difference is that Exh. R-32 is undated, when Exh. R-346 bears the handwritten date of 3 August 2010. This being so, since no issue of authenticity arises, the Tribunal will assess these differences in its analysis of the corruption allegations.\n\n741.\n\nIn sum, there is no indication in the record that Exh. R-346 is a forgery and the Tribunal will thus treat it as authentic.\n\n(m) Concluding comments on document authenticity\n------------------------------------------------\n\n742.\n\nIn the light of the allegations of forgery and the doubts raised by the Claimants about certain documents as well as the relevance of such documents to this dispute, the Tribunal sought an analysis from qualified independent forensic experts. It also heard from equally qualified party-appointed experts. The Tribunal acknowledges all of the experts' professionalism and efficient conduct throughout the document authenticity phase.\n\n743.\n\nWhile the Experts provided a full forensic review, the most relevant aspect of their analysis turned out to be the assessment of the handwritings and thus of the authenticity of the disputed signatures, on which the Tribunal\u2019s discussion mainly focused. The Tribunal nonetheless also carefully reviewed the findings resulting from the document examination. It found them to be essentially neutral in the sense that they give no indication on whether a document is forged or not. In any case, they provide no proof that the Disputed Documents are forged. Neither did Mr. Radley's analysis come up with such proof.\n\n744.\n\nBy contrast, the examination of the signatures, especially those of Messrs. Struik and Avidan in Exh. R-27 to Exh. R-29, produced much clearer evidence demonstrating that the disputed signatures are indeed authentic. Accordingly, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that Mr. Struik signed Exh. R-27 and that Mr. Avidan signed Exh. R-28 and Exh. R-29. The forensic evidence thus contradicted the testimony of Messrs. Struik and Avidan, who had stated to the Tribunal that they did not sign Exh. R-27 (for Mr. Struik) and Exh. R-28 and Exh. R-29 (for Mr. Avidan).\n\n745.\n\nWhile the Experts could not reach definitive conclusions with respect to the other disputed signatures, the record contains no evidence pointing to a forgery. To the contrary, among other elements, the Tribunal attributed weight to Mr. Noy\u2019s concession [REDACTED] that he had entered into contracts with Ms. Tour\u00e9. More specifically with respect to the signature of Ms. Tour\u00e9, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants do not argue that her signature was forged, since their case appears to be that Ms. Tour\u00e9 (or an unidentified third person) created these documents for illegitimate purposes.\n\n746.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that there is no evidence to suggest that the Disputed Documents are forged and that the signatures that appear on them are not authentic.\n\n**c. Corruption allegations**\n-----------------------------\n\ni. *Introductory comments*\n--------------------------\n\n747.\n\nOn the basis of its findings on the authenticity of the Disputed Documents, the Tribunal now turns to the assessment of the allegations of corruption and fraud put forward by the Respondent. The present dispute concerns two separate mining areas, the Zogota project and Blocks 1 & 2. The Tribunal will start with the first one, specifically with the exploration permits for North and South Simandou, the Base Convention and Zogota concession (section iv below), and then review the exploration permits for Blocks 1 & 2 (section v below). Because Ms. Tour\u00e9 (section ii below) and Pentler (section iii below) are recurrent actors in respect of the corruption and fraud allegations concerning both areas, the Tribunal will start by analyzing their roles.\n\nii. *The status and role of Ms. Tour\u00e9*\n--------------------------------------\n\n748.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was the fourth wife of the late President Cont\u00e9, which the Claimants deny. For the Claimants, Ms. Tour\u00e9 is an impostor engaging in blackmail and the Respondent has no evidence that she was President Cont\u00e9's wife or that she had any proximity allowing her to exert influence over him.904 As a result, the Claimants request that the Tribunal draw the proper adverse inferences.905 They further argue that Ms. Tour\u00e9 lacks credibility and thus request that the Tribunal give no weight to the statements she made in other proceedings. Finally, they ask the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences from the fact that the Respondent has not produced Ms. Tour\u00e9 as a witness.\n\nSee, for instance: Reply, Annex I, paras. 47-48; C-PHB1, paras. 85, 115.\n\nC-PHB1, paras. 156-157.\n\n749.\n\nBoth Parties place much weight on the role of Ms. Tour\u00e9 in this dispute. The Respondent alleges that she is the spider in the web and the central character in the corruption scheme. By contrast, the Claimants submit that Ms. Tour\u00e9 blackmailed them and, for that purpose, used forged documents.\n\n750.\n\nMs. Tour\u00e9, however, was not presented as a witness and none of the Parties requested that the Tribunal make use of its powers to order her appearance. When towards the end of the Merits Hearing, the Tribunal sought the Parties' views on this possibility, both Parties objected. The Claimants raised due process concerns and the Respondent saw practical difficulties. Therefore, the Tribunal decided not to call Ms. Tour\u00e9. Under the circumstances, it is unable to draw adverse inferences from the fact that the Respondent did not present Ms. Tour\u00e9 as a witness. The Claimants could have requested that the Tribunal call her as a witness earlier in the proceedings, but they chose not to do so and, when later asked, they opposed the suggestion. The Tribunal will revert below to the Claimants' other requests for adverse inferences.\n\n751.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Ms. Tour\u00e9's role. As a preliminary point, it is undisputed that she is the half-sister of Mr. Ibrahima Sory Tour\u00e9 and that BSGR Guinea employed Mr. Tour\u00e9 from late 2005 onwards, first on a temporary basis, then as Director of External Relations, and finally as Vice President of BSGR Guinea.906\n\nSee, for instance: Mem., paras. 74, 130(ii); Reply, para. 150 and Annex I, paras. 102 and 107; Struik (CWS-2), para. 37; Ibrahima Sory Tour\u00e9 Declaration, 10 May 2013, p. 1 (Exh. C-82); Letter of 26 December 2012 from BSGR to the Technical Committee, p. 7 (Exh. C-54).\n\n752.\n\nIt is further undisputed that President Cont\u00e9 had at least three wives, the issue being whether Mamadie Tour\u00e9 was the fourth one. It is common ground that the Respondent filed no certificate or other evidence of a marriage. It indeed alleges that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was married to President Cont\u00e9 in a traditional ceremony according to local customs.\n\n753.\n\nVarious elements in the record show that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was indeed the wife of President Cont\u00e9.907 She held a diplomatic passport, issued on 15 March 2007, stamped and signed by *\"Alpha Oumar Diallo, Chef de cabinet,* which mentions *\"Epouse P.R.G.,* i.e. \"spouse P.R.G.\".908 It seems likely that \"P.R.G.\" stands for *\"Pr\u00e9sident de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e\",* i.e. \"President of the Republic of Guinea\".\n\nSee also: R-PHB1, para. 205.\n\nPhotocopie de la page d'identit\u00e9 du passeport de Mme Tour\u00e9 (Exh. R-458).\n\n754.\n\nTellingly, various ministers testified at the Merits Hearing that it was public knowledge that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was the President's wife.909 For instance, Minister Sylla stated that President Cont\u00e9 introduced Ms. Tour\u00e9 to him as his wife and confirmed that he already knew beforehand that she was his fourth wife:\n\n\"I knew who she [i.e. Mamadie Tour\u00e9] was, because it was well known in Guinea that his Excellency the President of the Republic had married a fourth wife. So she was indeed his wife.\"910\n\nSee, for instance: Kant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 21.\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 7, 25:2-5 (Sylla). See also: (\"C'\u00e9tait le cas notamment de Mamadie Tour\u00e9, qui \u00e9tait la quatri\u00e8me \u00e9pouse du Pr\u00e9sident.

See further: Sylla (RWS-6), para. 3.\n\n755.\n\nSimilarly, Minister Souar\u00e9 identified the names of the four wives911 and confirmed that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was one of them:\n\n\"A. Let me tell you this: Mamadie Tour\u00e9 was the President's wife.\n\nQ. This is being challenged.\n\nA. This is what I know. Even if I haven't asked my boss for the marriage certificate, but this is what I know. She is the wife of the President.\"912\n\n(\"Q. Did you know Mamadie Tour\u00e9 at the time; not now, but then? A. Yes, of course. Q. How did you know what her connection was to the President? A. He is my President; I know his wives. He had four wives. [\u2026] Q. Can you give the names of the wives of the President? A. Yes. There is the first lady, Aria Cont\u00e9. Hadia Kajaset-Cont\u00e9. Mamadie Tour\u00e9 was the fourth. The third is Hadia Diallo\") Tr. (Merits), Day 6, 40:1-7 and 14-17 (Souar\u00e9).\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 6, 24:10-15 (Souar\u00e9). See also: Souar\u00e9 (RWS-2), para. 9.\n\n756.\n\nMinister Nab\u00e9 also stated in his witness declaration that:\n\n\"Je savais, comme tout le monde, que Mamadie Tour\u00e9 \u00e9tait l'\u00e9pouse du Pr\u00e9sident*.*\"913\n\nNab\u00e9 (RWS-5), para. 7.\n\n757.\n\nThe Claimants' witnesses acknowledged that Ms. Tour\u00e9 attended various meetings with the President where BSGR's business was discussed and the Claimants have not provided any cogent reason for her presence.914 The suggestion of Claimants' counsel that President Cont\u00e9 may have simply asked her to stay \"for ten minutes\" while he was handling some business was denied by Minister Souar\u00e9.915\n\nSee, for instance: Avidan (CWS-3), paras. 125, 134-135; Struik (CWS-2), para. 106. See further: Souar\u00e9 (RWS-2), paras. 9-10, 15-16; Kant\u00e9 (RWS-4), paras. 31 and 35; Nab\u00e9 (RWS-5), paras. 6-9.\n\n(\"MR DAELE: It would not be possible that she would have been there to deal with something that was handled before, and the President said, \"I have another meeting for ten minutes, you can stay? A. No. If that were the case, the President would have told her to wait next door. She would not be present at a meeting that was of no concern to her. It's not as if there was no place for her to go in the President's office\") Tr. (Merits), Day 6, 44:11-19 (Souar\u00e9).\n\n758.\n\nThere is also contemporary evidence of Ms. Tour\u00e9's marital status on record. So for instance a video shows Ms. Tour\u00e9 attending an official ceremony in October 2008 on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of Guinea's independence916 and contemporary press releases refer to Ms. Tour\u00e9 as the wife of President Cont\u00e9.917 Wikileaks also released diplomatic cables from the US embassy in Guinea dating back to September 2008, identifying Ms. Tour\u00e9 as the fourth wife of President Cont\u00e9.918 There is also a photograph of her standing next to the President while he receives a foreign investor.919\n\nEnregistrement vid\u00e9o de la c\u00e9r\u00e9monie du cinquantenaire de l'ind\u00e9pendance \u00e0 Dubr\u00e9ka, 2 octobre 2008, cf. 28'00\" and 31'00\" (Exh.

R-482).\n\n759.\n\nThe record further demonstrates that the Claimants were aware at the time that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was President Cont\u00e9's wife. For instance, she attended a reception hosted by BSGR in September 2006 on its premises in Conakry under the protection of so-called *\"b\u00e9rets rouges\"* guards.920 While Mr. Avidan testified that these *\"b\u00e9rets rouges [were] our b\u00e9rets rouges\"* because various ministers requiring protection attended the event,921 Minister Souar\u00e9 explained in no uncertain terms that the \"*b\u00e9rets rouges*\" did not protect cabinet members and were \"only dedicated to the Presidency\".922\n\nEnregistrement vid\u00e9o de la r\u00e9ception de BSGR \u00e0 Conakry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOfNE2gZH1o, 19 septembre 2007 (Exh.

(Merits), Day 6, 103:3-8 (Souar\u00e9).\n\n760.\n\nMr. Souar\u00e9\u2019s testimony appears corroborated when one views the video of that reception. The video shows various military men with green, blue and red berets and different uniforms.923 When Ms. Tour\u00e9 arrived some time later at least six *\"b\u00e9rets rouges\"* surrounded her.924 If those *\"b\u00e9rets rouges\"* were indeed part of BSGR\u2019s security team to protect high-ranking officials as Mr. Avidan contends, he failed to provide a plausible explanation why Ms. Tour\u00e9 also benefited from their protection, and why she received significantly more protection than other attendees. She was also shown particular reverence and courtesy, with people being introduced to her as if she were an important person.925 Additionally, a contemporary press release mentions \"[l]a pr\u00e9sence de la 4\u00e8me \u00e9pouse du Chef de l\u2019Etat\" at the BSGR reception,926 and the subtitle of another one reads \"La c\u00e9r\u00e9minie [sic] inaugurale du si\u00e8ge de BSGResources- Guinea, \u00e0 la Mini\u00e8re, pr\u00e9sid\u00e9e par la 4 \u00e8me \u00e9pouse du Chef de l\u2019Etat, Madame Cont\u00e9 n\u00e9e Mamadie Tour\u00e9, jeune soeur du Chef services Relations Ext\u00e9rieures de ladite repr\u00e9sentation, n\u2019a pas connu une grande affluence\".927\n\nEnregistrement vid\u00e9o de la r\u00e9ception de BSGR \u00e0 Conakry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOfNE2gZH1o, 19 septembre 2007, (e.g. at 12'00\", 13'44\", 14'02\", 14'30\", 15'48\", 16'10\", 16'17\") (Exh.

For instance, Mr. Noy wrote an email to Mr. Steinmetz in 2009 specifying that Matinda and Co. was a \"company [that] belongs to Mrs TOURE, wife of late president of Guinea\".928 Incidentally, this does away with Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s assertion that he never heard the name of Ms. Tour\u00e9 until 2011 or 2012.929 Moreover, Mr. Avidan confirmed that his discussion in 2012 with Walter Hennig about \"the fourth one\" related to Ms. Tour\u00e9.930\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nTr.

C-107).\n\n762.\n\nMore significantly, an undercover FBI recording taken at Jacksonville airport on 11 April 2013 shows that Mr. Cilins tried to get Ms. Tour\u00e9 to state she was not President Cont\u00e9\u2019s fourth wife. Six days prior to that meeting, on 5 April 2013, Mr. Daniel Pollack from BSGR had sent a preliminary version of that statement to Mr. Steinmetz, which read in relevant part as follows: *\"Je n\u2019ai jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 mari\u00e9e avec le Pr\u00e9sident Cont\u00e9 aujourd\u2019hui d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9.

R-35).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n764.\n\nBased on all these elements, the Tribunal finds that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was indeed President Cont\u00e9's wife. In the light of the clear record, it is surprising that the Claimants expended so much effort seeking to cast doubt on this marital relationship. Be this as it may, even if the Tribunal were to consider that Ms. Tour\u00e9's marital relationship with the President was insufficiently substantiated, *quod non,* it would in any event conclude that Ms. Tour\u00e9 and the President had a very close relationship and that the Claimants were aware at the time that she was exerting influence over him.\n\n765.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Struik conceded that Ms. Tour\u00e9, whom BSGR officers used to call \"the Lady\",937 had \"the ear\" of the President.938 For instance, in an email of 18 September 2007 to Messrs. Steinmetz, Struik and Saada, Mr. Avidan included her among the \"key people in the country\", alongside President Cont\u00e9 and the Prime Minister:\n\n\"In the next few days I am going to meet some of the key people in the country including the Prime Minister, the Lady and maybe the President to push them forward so as to reduce some technical and administrative problems.\"939\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 175:18-23. He also called Ms. Tour\u00e9 the \"*prot\u00e9g\u00e9e*\" of President Cont\u00e9: Mr. Struik testified as follows: \"Q. And did a lot of people recognize her? A. They probably did. They probably knew that she was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9e of the President, as I call it. Q. Did [Mr. Cilins] mention to you that she had some kind of special relationship with the President? A. He mentioned to me that she was somehow in the protection of the President\". Tr.

[REDACTED]\n\n766.\n\nMr. Avidan's explanation at the Merits Hearing that he wanted to make sure to get her out of the way so as not to interfere with BSGR's business is thus not plausible.\n\n767.\n\nMr. Avidan apparently provided regular reports to Ms. Tour\u00e9. He admitted that each time before he left Conakry he went to see Ms. Tour\u00e9 and tell her \"what we were doing in the field\".940 This is in line with the fact that she attended several business meetings together with the President (paras. 757-758 above).941\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 9, 193:24-194:4. The fact that Mr. Avidan allegedly told her at one point not to get involved in matters relating to mining does not negate her influence.\n\nSee, for instance: Avidan (CWS-3), paras. 125, 134-135; Struik (CWS-2), para. 106.

(Merits) (FR), Day 6, 16:26-28 (Souar\u00e9).\n\n770.\n\nTo conclude, the record establishes that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was President Cont\u00e9\u2019s fourth wife and that she was in a position to influence him. It further evidences that the Claimants had contemporaneous knowledge of her status and position of influence. Moreover, it is undisputed that the Claimants employed Mr. Tour\u00e9, who is Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s half-brother and President Cont\u00e9\u2019s brother-in-law.\n\niii. *The role of Pentler*\n--------------------------\n\n771.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that BSGR used the BVI company Pentler as a front company, through which Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy could enter into commission agreements with third parties to assist in obtaining mining rights. In particular, Mr. Cilins introduced Ms. Tour\u00e9 to the Claimants who allegedly created Matinda to help Ms. Tour\u00e9 conceal her activities. The Claimants would not have obtained their exploration permits without Pentler\u2019s assistance, says the Respondent, and the Claimants used Pentler or its principals to funnel payments to Ms. Tour\u00e9. The Claimants dispute that Pentler is a front company or that they sought to conceal their activities by using Pentler. They observe that they did not incorporate Pentler or Matinda, and that Pentler was not used to enter into commission agreements with third parties.\n\n772.\n\nIt is common ground that until 2006 Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy operated in West Africa through the companies FMA International and CW France.946 It is also unchallenged that they approached Mr. Oron at the end of 2004 or the beginning of 2005 to discuss mining opportunities in Guinea, in particular in the Simandou mountains.947 It is further uncontroversial that neither of them had mining experience.948\n\nC-PHB1, para. 196; Tchelet (CWS-11), para. 5; Extrait Kbis de CW France, 3 mai 2016 (Exh.

Ms. Tour\u00e9 was present and the President called Minister Souar\u00e9.951 At that meeting, President Cont\u00e9 authorized BSGR to use his helicopter for a reconnaissance flight the following day, which caused an incident because the helicopter landed in an area held by Rio Tinto.952 Minister Souar\u00e9 then called BSGR to his office on 2 December 2005 to discuss the incident. According to Minister Souar\u00e9, Ms. Tour\u00e9 was also present at that meeting and supported BSGR's bid for an exploration permit over Simandou.953\n\n(\"We have special interest in the deposits of iron at Simandou and Mount Nimba, and have wondered if there would be any room for us to participate in the exploitation and development of these reserves, or any other similar reserves in Guinea. We understand that development of these reserves would require significant infrastructure investment, and here we also have vast experience and capabilities\") [REDACTED]\n\nStruik (CWS-2), paras. 10-11.

How Mr. Cilins got to know Ms. Tour\u00e9 is described in a letter that Mr. Bah wrote to Mr. Cilins on 15 March 2010:\n\n\"Mr Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cillins [sic], rappelez vous que vous \u00e9tiez venus dans mon bureau \u00e0 Bamako avec Mr Dao Ismael me voir.

On 14 February 2006, BSGR Guinea BVI and Pentler entered into a contract, whereby the former committed to transfer 17,65% of its shares to Pentler (amounting to 15% in the Simandou project) and to pay success fees in the amount of USD 19.5 million. The Tribunal will revert to that contract below. At this point, it is noteworthy that, the day before, Onyx Financial Advisors Ltd. (\"Onyx BVI\") had sold Pentler to Messrs. Noy, Lev Ran and Cilins for USD 1,500.956\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n777.\n\nOnyx BVI was a company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 1998.957 Its main shareholder was Mr. Dag Cramer, who had left his job at Anglo American in 2003 \"to join BSG and Onyx\".958 Onyx BVI had various subsidiaries, such as Onyx Financial Advisors S.A. (\"Onyx Switzerland\") and Margali Management Corp. (\"Margali\"). According to the Claimants, the BSG group of companies was \"one of Onyx\u2019s main clients, but it was not its only client\".959 In fact, Onyx BVI was \"under contract to the Balda Foundation, which ultimately holds the BSG group of companies\"960 and of which Mr. Steinmetz is the ultimate beneficial owner.961\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nMr. Cramer held his shares in Onyx BVI through Galena Management Services Inc. Cramer (CWS-7), para. 5 (Exh. C-150).\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 21. See also: (\"The Balda Foundation is certainly the Onyx group's largest client, although it is not its only client\") Cramer (CWS-7), para. 10.\n\nMerloni-Horemans (CWS-9), para. 8.\n\nCramer (CWS-7), para. 4.\n\n778.\n\nMs. Merloni-Horemans was Director and Head of Administration of Onyx BVI and Onyx Switzerland from 1998 to December 2014. Prior to that, she was an administrative and trading assistant in the rough diamond trading division at R. Steinmetz & Sons NV in Antwerp, Belgium. Ms. Merloni-Horemans stated that Onyx provided \"management, corporate, administrative and financial services\" to the Balda Foundation \"and the underlying companies\" and one of her main responsibilities for Onyx was to \"keep the corporate back office of the BSG group of companies\".962 She also sat on most boards of the BSG companies as a non-executive board member representing the board of the Balda Foundation.963\n\nMerloni-Horemans (CWS-9), para. 8.\n\nMerloni-Horemans (CWS-9), para. 8.\n\n779.\n\nPentler was registered in the British Virgin Islands on 28 October 2005.964 Pentler was a 100% subsidiary of Onyx BVI until it was sold to Messrs. Noy, Lev Ran and Cilins in February 2006. Ms. Merloni-Horemans, who represented the Balda Foundation on the Board of Onyx BVI, Onyx Switzerland, Onyx UK, Margali and BSGR, signed all the documents on behalf of Pentler in her capacity as administrator of Margali.965\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nCM, para. 73.\n\n780.\n\nThus, while BSGR may never have held Pentler, it is clear that the latter was a dormant company kept by Onyx, BSGR's \"corporate back office\",966 and then sold to Messrs. Noy, Lev Ran and Cilins shortly after BSGR had obtained its exploration permits over North and South Simandou.\n\nMerloni-Horemans (CWS-9), paras. 8, 13.\n\n781.\n\nIn addition, on the day on which Ms. Merloni-Horemans agreed with Mr. Noy to sell Pentler for USD 1,500,967 she signed a document promising to transfer to Pentler 17.65% of the shares of BSGR Guinea BVI, subject to the conclusion of a contract between BSGR Guinea BVI and Guinea for the exploitation of iron ore and bauxite in Guinea:\n\n\"Je soussign\u00e9e, agissant en ma qualit\u00e9 d'administrateur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 susmentionn\u00e9e, confirme par la pr\u00e9sente que nous, Onyx Financial Advisors SA, domicili\u00e9s 25 Voie de Traz, 1211 Gen\u00e8ve 5, en Suisse, d\u00e9tenons 8825 actions (huit mille huit cent et vingt cinq actions), de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited, soit 17,65 % de son capital social, pour le compte de:\n\n**Nom : Pentler Holdings Limited**\n\n**Adresse : Akara Building, 24 De Castro Street, Wickhams Cay 1, Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands**\n\nEt ce sous r\u00e9serve de l'ex\u00e9cution du contrat entre BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited et le gouvernement de la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e relativement \u00e0 l'exploration miniere [sic] de minerai de fer et de bauxite en Guin\u00e9e.\"968\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED] (Emphasis in the original). On 15 February 2006, Mr. Noy and Ms. Merloni-Horemans exchanged various emails about initial drafts of this contract [REDACTED]. The last version sent by Ms. Merloni-Horemans deleted the reference to Margali and replaced it with Mr. Lev Ran (Exh. R-187). Ms. Merloni-Horemans testified that she did not read the content of the contract but only focused on the signature block, while conceding that she didn't \"recall what [she] did at the time\" (Tr. (Merits), Day 2, 177:3-14 (Merloni-Horemans)). She also testified that she had no idea who Mr. Bah was (Tr. (Merits), Day 2, 178:3 (Merloni-Horemans)). However, when asked whether the promised remuneration of over USD 15 million should have alerted her, she said that, with hindsight, she should definitely have asked more questions (Tr. (Merits), Day 2, 178:4-19 (Merloni-Horemans)).\n\n782.\n\nStill on 14 February 2006, i.e. the date when Pentler and BSGR Guinea BVI contracted (paragraph 776 above), Mr. Struik wrote to Pentler to clarify \"the relationship between [...] BSGR Guinea and [...] Pentler with regard to the Simandou Iron Ore Project located in the Republic of Guinea\" (the \"Milestone Agreement\"):969\n\n\"BSGR Guinea affords Pentler an interest of 15% (free carry) in the Simandou Iron Ore Project. In order to effect this interest, a 17,65% shareholding in BSGR Guinea will be made available to Pentler. Further details of the relationship between the shareholders will be formalized in a shareholders agreement.\"970\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n783.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Struik agreed to the payment of success fees in a total amount of USD 19.5 million according to various milestones on the path to obtaining mining rights in Simandou North and South as well as Blocks 1 and 2:\n\n\"With specific regard to the Simandou Iron Ore Project, success fees are based on the mutually agreed milestones as shown in the table overleaf. Amounts payable will be made into a nominated bank account against provision of invoices from Pentler for services rendered in such regard upon meeting the set milestones.\"\n\n784.\n\nMr. Struik\u2019s letter to Pentler includes the following table with the milestones and success fees:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Milestone | Total Success Fee |\n| Zones North and South | Blocks 1 and 2 |\n| Signing of the MOU and issuing of corresponding prospecting permits | USD500,000 | USD1,500,000 |\n| Completion of a satisfactory feasibility study and registration of \"Companie Miniere de Fer de Simandou\" | USD500,000 | USD1,000,000 |\n| Signing of \"Convention de Base\" | USD500,000 | USD1,000,000 |\n| Signing of \"Decret Presidentiel de la Concession\" and issuing of corresponding mining permits | USD1,000,000 | USD1,000,000 |\n| Commercial production and export of first tonne of iron ore product from Simandou | USD2,000,000 | NIL |\n| Commercial production and export of first 10 million tonnes of iron orc product from Simandou | USD4,000,000 | NIL |\n| Repayment of all investments by BSGR (Guinea) Limited | USD6,500,000 | NIL |\n| Total | USD15,000,000 | USD4,500,000 |\n\n785.\n\nSix days later, on 20 February 2006, Pentler entered into a series of contracts with third parties, including Mr. Bah, Mr. Tour\u00e9, Mr. Daou and Ms Tour\u00e9. The first contract was with Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9 and provided that Pentler would pay these two persons fees in connection with the iron ore project in Simandou and Blocks 1 and 2 on meeting milestones, which were identical to those in the BSGR/Pentler agreement just discussed:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Phase** | **\u00c9volution** | **Zones Nord et Sud** | **Blocs 1 et 2** |\n| **1** | Signature du Protocole d\u2019Accord et d\u00e9livrance des Permis de Recherche correspondants | 425.000 USD | 1.200.000 USD |\n| **2** | Etude de faisabilit\u00e9 et cr\u00e9ation de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mixte | 400.000 USD | 800.000 USD |\n| **3** | Signature de la Convention de Base pour les zones Mord et Sud et blocs 1 et 2 | 400.000 USD | 800.000 USD |\n| **4** | Signature du D\u00e9cret Pr\u00e9sidentiel de la Concession et d\u00e9livrance des permis correspondants | 800.000 USD | 800.000 USD |\n| **5** | Exportation de la 1er tonne de minerai de fer | 1.600.000 USD |  |\n| **6** | Exportation de 10 millions de minerai de fer | 3.200.000 USD |  |\n| **7** | Retour sur investissement | 5.200.000 USD |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  | **TOTAL** | **12.025.000 USD** | **3.600.000 USD** |\n\n786.\n\nAccordingly, Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9 were promised a total of USD 12,025,000 on completion of various steps towards the production and export of iron ore from North and South Simandou. On the same day, Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9 also confirmed receipt of USD 425,000 corresponding to the first milestone payment.971 Indeed, Guinea and BSGR Guinea BVI had concluded the MoU on that day, and the exploration permits had already been issued on 6 February 2006 (paragraph 205 above).\n\n[REDACTED] The Tribunal notes that Mr. Bah sent a letter to Mr. Cilins in 2010 requesting the outstanding payments, while at the same time recalling his role in introducing Ms. Tour\u00e9 to Mr. Cilins. The Claimants maintain that Mr. Bah sought to blackmail BSGR, but there is no evidence of a criminal complaint and, tellingly, Mr. Struik stated that he considered Mr. Bah's alleged blackmail attempts as a \"non-event\" and that \"we/I ignored this like we/I ignored Mr Bah\" Struik (CSW-12), para. 28. See Memorandum of Understanding between the Republic of Guinea and BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited, 20 February 2006 (Exh. C-9); [REDACTED]\n\n787.\n\nRelying on their witnesses, the Claimants contend that BSGR had nothing to do with the contracts that Pentler entered into with third parties.972 Mr. Struik stated that he met Mr. Bah once in 2006 on the introduction of Mr. Cilins, but had \"no idea who he was nor what he was doing there\".973 Mr. Struik also denied having been involved in the negotiation of this contract, of which he allegedly became aware only \"much later\".974\n\nStruik (CWS-2), para. 112; Struik (CWS-12), para. 32.\n\nStruik (CWS-12), para. 23.\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 125:9 (Struik).\n\n788.\n\nSuch denial is contradicted by the fact that an initial version of that contract dated 17 January 2006 was found on his laptop.975 That version referred to payments by an unidentified \"Company\" which would explore and operate \"the Simandou iron deposit\", and can only be BSGR Guinea BVI. The final text then referred to Pentler. The initial version read as follows:\n\n\"The Company undertakes to remunerate Mr. Bah and Mr. Tour\u00e9 for their services and advice concerning the development of the project for exploration and operation of the Simandou iron deposit by the Company covering the North and South zones of Simandou as well as Blocks 1 and 2 of the Simandou chain.\"976\n\nProtocole d'accord Pentler/Bah/I.S. Tour\u00e9, 17 janvier 2006 (Exh. R-584).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n789.\n\nMr. Struik admitted that this initial draft was saved on his laptop and that he was in Guinea on 17 January 2006.977 However, he stated that he had no idea where this document originated from and insisted that he did not draft it nor was otherwise involved in its drafting.978 The Claimants\u2019 explanation that Mr. Cilins used Mr. Struik\u2019s laptop when they both stayed at the Novotel in Conakry is not convincing.979 There is no indication in the record that Mr. Cilins had direct access to Mr. Struik\u2019s computer, neither did Mr. Struik state so. Contrary to the Claimants\u2019 submission, Mr. Cilins merely obtained \"copies of all the *materials prepared by visitors* in the business centre of the Novotel\" from the staff of the Novotel.980 The Tribunal understands this to mean that the staff in the business centre of the Novotel provided Mr. Cilins with copies of documents that were, for instance, printed or photocopied there, not that he had access to Mr. Struik\u2019s laptop. Accordingly, the record suggests that Mr. Struik was involved in the drafting of the contract between Pentler and Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9.\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 133:18-20 and 135:20-25 (Struik).\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 133:12-17 (Struik). See also: C-PHB1, para. 206.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 207.\n\nRapport d'entretien avec M. Cilins, 5 octobre 2011 (probable), p. 3 (Exh. R-165) (Emphasis added by the Tribunal). The Tribunal is mindful that the Claimants dispute that the Veracity Report found in Exh. R-165 is \"accurate in its entirety\". However, the Claimants cited the quote in the main text above to support their explanation on how the initial draft found its way into Mr. Struik's laptop. See: C-PHB1, para. 207, n. 452; Reply, para. 258.\n\n790.\n\nThe second agreement which Pentler entered into on 20 February 2006 was with Ms. Tour\u00e9. It referred to BSGR's efforts to obtain mining rights in Simandou and granted Ms. Tour\u00e9 a 5% interest in the Simandou project, in the form of a 33% free-carry interest in Pentler.981 As was seen above, there is no evidence that this agreement was forged [REDACTED]. A draft of that agreement had previously been sent to Ms. Merloni-Horemans.982\n\nProtocole Pentler /Mme Tour\u00e9 de 2006, 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 (Exh. R-24).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n791.\n\nPentler concluded two further contracts on 20 February 2006, this time with Mr. Daou, by which it agreed to transfer to Mr. Daou a free-carry interest of 13,32% in Pentler amounting to an indirect participation of 2% in the Simandou project.983 Mr. Daou was also promised payments totaling USD 2,975,000 for North and South Simandou,984 payable on reaching the same milestones as those found in the agreement with Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9:\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Phase** | **Evolution** | **Zones Nord et Sud** | **Blocs 1 et 2** |\n| 1 | **Signature du Protocole d\u2019Accord et d\u00e9livrance des Permis de Recherche correspondants** | **75.000 USD** | **300.000 USD** |\n| 2 | **Etude de faisabilit\u00e9 et cr\u00e9ation de h Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mixte** | **100.000 USD** | **200.000 USD** |\n| **3** | **Signature de la Convention de Base pour les zones Nord et Sud et blocs 1 et 2** | **100.000 USD** | **200.000 USD** |\n| **4** | **Signature du D\u00e9cret Pr\u00e9sidentiel de la Concession et d\u00e9livrance des permis correspondants** | **200.000 USD** | **200.000 USD** |\n| **5** | **Exportation de la 1er tonne de minerai de fer** | **400.000 USD** |  |\n| **6** | **Exportation de 10 millions de minerai de fer** | **800.000 USD** |  |\n| **7** | **Retour sur investissement** | **1.300.000 USD** |  |\n|  |  |  |  |\n|  | **TOTAL** | **2.975.000 USD** | **900.000 USD** |\n\nProtocole Pentler/Daou n\u00ba 2, 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 (Exh. R-185).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n792.\n\nAccordingly, the aggregate amount of the fees payable to Messrs. Daou and Bah and Tour\u00e9 for Simandou matches the total fees provided in the Milestone Agreement, i.e. USD 12,025,000 + USD 2,975,000 = USD 15,000,000.\n\n793.\n\nThe Claimants' thesis that Ms. Merloni-Horemans did not read the content of these contracts and BSGR had no knowledge of them does not conform with the facts. Ms. Merloni-Horemans received drafts of the contracts and discussed them with Mr. Noy or his assistant. For instance, Mr. Noy's assistant sent various emails to Ms. Merloni-Horemans containing a draft version of the contract saying *\"Pour faire suite \u00e0 notre conversation\"* or \"As per your discussion with Michael\", showing that the contract had been discussed by Ms. Merloni-Horemans.985\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n794.\n\nIt emerges from the facts just reviewed that Pentler acted for BSGR and paid intermediaries for the achievement of milestones on the way to the production of iron ore at Simandou. They also show that BSGR used Pentler as a conduit to remunerate intermediaries and conceal its own participation. The contrary explanations provided by the Claimants and their witnesses are not convincing and disproved by the record. In particular, the Claimants' submission that Pentler was created as an empty shelf company on 28 October 2005 and randomly selected to be sold to Messrs. Noy, Lev Ran and Cilins on 13 February 2006 is contradicted by the existence of a Services and Cooperation Agreement between BSG Metals and Mining Limited and Pentler dated 15 October 2005.986 Mrs. Merloni-Horemans stated that she executed this document after the sale of Pentler and backdated it \"at the instruction of the BSGR management team\".987 It can remain open whether she backdated this document to formalize a pre-existing relationship. What is striking is that BSGR gave Ms. Merloni-Horemans instructions, which she qualified as \"not ideal\",988 in an apparent effort to cover up the reality of the relationship between BSGR and Messrs. Noy, Lev Ran and Cilins.\n\nServices & Co-operation Agreement between BSG Metals and Mining Limited & Pentler Limited, 15 October 2005 (Exh. C-331).\n\n\"Q. Did it strike you as odd that if you look at the first of this document, as you just said, that is was 'made and entered into effective as of the 15th day of October'? You've just explained \u2013 so we've saved some questions \u2013 how Mr Tchelet explained to you that this confirmed a pre-existing oral agreement going back. But as a corporate director, did it seem odd to you to sign an agreement that was going to be made and entered into effect prior to the existence of Pentler? A. I did it at the instruction of the BSGR management team. This document formalised the relationship that they had before, the agreement \u2013 oral agreement that they had before. And you are right that at the time Pentler did not belong to the three shareholders yet. Q. I'm sorry, Pentler didn't even exist yet, right? Pentler was created on 28th October 2005, and this agreement is made to take effect 13 days before it came into existence, right? A. Mm-hm\". Tr. (Merits), Day 2, 163:21-164:14 (Merloni-Horemans).\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 2, 165:2 (Merloni-Horemans).\n\n795.\n\nThe Tribunal is further unconvinced by the Claimants\u2019 assertion that BSGR was not involved with Pentler\u2019s dealings with third parties in relation to BSGR\u2019s mining rights. Many of the facts analyzed previously demonstrate that a close relationship existed between BSGR and Pentler.\n\n796.\n\nAn initial version of the Bah/Tour\u00e9 contract of 20 February 2006 was found on Mr. Struik\u2019s laptop.989 The success fees in the Milestone Agreement between BSGR and Pentler match the total amounts in Pentler\u2019s contracts with Messrs. Daou, Bah and Tour\u00e9.990 Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy sent invoices on the letterhead of FMA or CW France for services but the payments were made for different services than those appearing in the invoices, thus suggesting that payments were made on the basis of fake invoices.991 All the contracts which Pentler concluded with third parties refer to the Simandou mining project *\"auquel participe Pentler Holdings Ltd\u2019,* which project was carried out by BSGR.992 The second contract concluded with Mr. Daou on 20 February 2006 in fact expressly referred to BSGR\u2019s efforts to develop and exploit the Simandou mining project and stated that BSGR had approached the Guinean authorities to authorize Mr. Daou\u2019s indirect shareholding in that project.993 For that purpose, Pentler committed to transfer to Mr. Daou 13.32% of its own shareholding in BSGR Guinea.994 The contract concluded between Pentler and Ms. Tour\u00e9 also expressly referred to BSGR's efforts to develop mining activities in Guinea and stated that Pentler would transfer to her part of its shares in BSGR Guinea.995\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nSee paragraphs 809 and 815 below.\n\nSee, for instance: Protocole Pentler/Bah/I.S. Tour\u00e9, 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 (Exh. R-183) to Protocole Pentler/Daou n\u00ba 2, 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 (Exh.

A cet effet, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSGR Guin\u00e9e constituera, avec la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e, une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 anonyme \u00e0 participation publique, qui sera d\u00e9nomm\u00e9e Compagnie Mini\u00e8re de SIMANDOU\") Protocole Pentler/Daou n\u00ba 2, 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 (Exh.

R-24).\n\n797.\n\nAdditional facts reinforce the finding that Pentler served as a conduit to cover up BSGR's involvement with third party intermediaries. In particular, as the assessment below will show, Pentler was largely remunerated for undisclosed services. The allegation that Messrs. Noy, Lev Ran and Cilins were only remunerated for signaling to BSGR the opportunity to mine in the Simandou area does not withstand scrutiny, if one considers that the mining potential of Simandou was public knowledge before BSGR arrived in Guinea. In other words, BSGR did not need Pentler to signal this \"opportunity\". Moreover, Pentler was not a \"local partner\" as understood by the Claimants' expert, Mr. Ferreira, nor did Messrs. Noy, Lev Ran and Cilins have any experience or expertise in mining. In fact, the Claimants failed to provide a cogent explanation about the services provided by Pentler or for the level of Pentler's remuneration.\n\n798.\n\nMore importantly, the letters which Mr. Bah sent to Messrs. Struik and Cilins in 2009 and 2010 tend to support the conclusion that Mr. Struik was directly involved in the negotiation and conclusion of Pentler's contracts with third parties.996 In other words, Mr. Struik was fully aware that Pentler was contracting with Messrs. Bah, Daou and Tour\u00e9. This, in turn, suggests that Mr. Struik was aware that the amount of the success fees promised to Pentler under the 14 February 2006 agreement matched the total of the success fees which Pentler committed to pay to third parties in the various 20 February 2006 agreements.\n\nLettre de M. Bah \u00e0 MM. Lev Ran et Cilins (Pentler), 15 mars 2010 (Exh. R-174); Lettre de M. Bah \u00e0 BSGR et Pentler, 30 novembre 2009 (Exh. R-311); Lettre de M. Bah \u00e0 M.

R-316).\n\n799.\n\nSimilarly, Mr. Cilins' own statements and those of Ms. Tour\u00e9 show that Mr. Cilins initially acted as BSGR's representative.997 [REDACTED]998 Ms. Tour\u00e9 also stated that, in December 2005, she introduced Mr. Cilins to President Cont\u00e9 as a representative of BSGR,999 and he also appeared in that capacity at the meeting with Minister Souar\u00e9. Moreover, Ms. Tour\u00e9 stated that she asked Mr. Cilins why the 20 February 2006 agreement was entered into with Pentler instead of BSGR. According to Ms. Tour\u00e9, Mr. Cilins answered that Pentler was acting on behalf of BSGR.1000\n\nAttestation de M. Cilins, 26 novembre 2012, pp. 1-2 (Exh.

R-35).\n\n800.\n\nIn addition, it is noteworthy that the Claimants concealed their ties to Pentler or other intermediaries during Vale's due diligence prior to acquiring its 51% interest in BSGR Guinea.1001 Thus, for instance, the Claimants represented that \"BSGR Guinea did not use any intermediary in its application process nor during any further discussions with the CPDM, which is the technical department of the Ministry of Mines, responsible for adjudicating the applications and final awarding of the exploration licenses to the successful party\".1002 BSGR Guinea also failed to identify Pentler as a consultant or intermediary in connection with the Simandou Project, notwithstanding the existence of the 14 February 2006 agreement.1003\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n801.\n\nSignificantly, Mr. Cilins went to Florida in March-April 2013 to convince Ms. Tour\u00e9 to destroy evidence (in particular the original versions of contracts) and to sign a statement denying her involvement in the Simandou project and her marriage with President Cont\u00e9.1004 Mr. Steinmetz acknowledged that he knew of Mr. Cilins' trip beforehand, although he stated that he only told Mr. Cilins to obtain a declaration from Ms. Tour\u00e9 and that he had no knowledge of Mr. Cilins' attempt at tampering with evidence. The Tribunal will review this issue in more detail below and the analysis will show that Mr. Steinmetz in fact wanted to ensure that Mr. Cilins destroyed the evidence. This again shows that BSGR and Pentler were involved in a complex scheme to obtain mining rights through corrupt practices, to dissimulate these undertakings, and to ultimately destroy evidence and silence witnesses.\n\nTranscription \u00e9crite, par constat d'huissier, de l'enregistrement audio de conversations entre M. Cilins et, notamment, Mme Tour\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par le Federal Bureau of Investigation aux Etats-Unis, 29 novembre 2013, p. 54 (Exh. R-36).\n\niv. *The Zogota mining permits and the Base Convention*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n802.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants obtained their mining rights for North and South Simandou, including the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession, through corrupt practices. In addition to securing the influence of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and her half-brother, Guinea claims that the Claimants resorted to Pentler as a conduit to set up their corrupt scheme and then to cover it up.\n\n803.\n\nThe Claimants object that they obtained their mining rights legally and deny having engaged in corrupt practices to obtain the mining area of Zogota. In particular, they dispute that Ms. Tour\u00e9 played any role in the award of the mining rights. According to them, Pentler was only instrumental for identifying mining \"opportunities\" and setting up shop in Conakry and lost its purpose for BSGR once Messrs. Struik and Avidan had established their operations in 2006.\n\n804.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that, on 6 February 2006, BSGR Guinea BVI obtained for three years (i) four exploration permits in the prefectures of Beyla, Macenta, Nzerekore and Yomou (\"Sud Simandou\" or \"Zogota\")1005 and (ii) four exploration permits in the prefecture of Kerouane (\"Nord Simandou\") (see maps at paragraphs 201 and 208 above).1006 On 20 February 2006, Guinea and BSGR Guinea BVI entered into a MoU setting out the framework of their cooperation.1007 Under the MoU, BSGR Guinea BVI undertook to carry out a feasibility study within 30 months and Guinea committed to grant BSGR Guinea BVI a mining concession within six months of the feasibility study. On 21 January 2009, BSGR Guinea applied to renew the Nord Simandou and Sud Simandou exploration permits, which application was granted on 10 June 2009.1008 On 16 November 2009, BSGR Guinea submitted the feasibility study for the Zogota project.1009 On 1 December 2009, Minister Thiam established a commission to review the feasibility study and negotiate the terms of a concession.1010 On 16 December 2009, the Base Convention was signed,1011 which the President Konat\u00e9 ratified on 19 March 2010.1012 On the same day, the President granted BSGR Guinea a mining concession for Zogota.1013\n\nDecree No. 2006/706/MMG/SGG, 6 February 2006 (Exh.

C-17).\n\n805.\n\nFor the reasons explained in the following sections, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the Claimants obtained the North and South Simandou exploration permits, the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession through corruption. BSGR used Pentler and others to buy the influence of Ms. Tour\u00e9, her half-brother and other individuals ((a) below) in circumstances where these individuals had no qualifications in the mining sector ((b) below), provided no services for the compensation they received ((c) below), and were selected without any meaningful due diligence ((d) below). In addition, the Claimants sought to destroy evidence of their corrupt practices ((e) below).\n\n(a) Payments and gifts effected by intermediaries for BSGR to buy influence\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n806.\n\nThe following section reviews the alleged payments and gifts made by or on behalf of BSGR to various intermediaries and government officials to obtain the disputed mining rights in North and South Simandou, including Pentler, Messrs. Bah, Tour\u00e9 and Daou, Ms. Tour\u00e9, Minister Thiam and the members of the Technical Commission. As outlined below, the evidence shows that BSGR paid over USD 30 million to intermediaries (including USD 30,385,000 to Pentler and USD 450,000 to Mr. Tour\u00e9), arranged for intermediaries such as Pentler, Mr. Schiffman or Mr. Boutros to pay USD 9,419,200 to Ms. Tour\u00e9 and USD 425,000 to Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9, and paid government officials in the amount of USD 35,424.68 (including USD 15,424.68 to Mr. Thiam and USD 20,000 to the members of the Technical Commission).\n\n*Pentler*\n---------\n\n807.\n\nStarting with Pentler, the 14 February 2006 letter sent by Mr. Struik on behalf of BSGR Guinea BVI to Pentler promised a 17.65% equity interest in BSGR Guinea BVI and success fees of USD 19.5 million if certain milestones were reached.1014 The letter specified that payment of the success fees would be \"made into a nominated bank account against provision of invoices from Pentler for services rendered in such regard upon meeting the set milestones\".1015\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n808.\n\nThere is no clear evidence that Pentler was paid USD 500,000 corresponding to the first milestone in relation with the North and South Simandou exploration permits and the MoU. However, there are documents showing that Pentler received USD 125,000 in connection with the signature of the MoU dated 20 February 2006. On 27 February 2006, CW France sent an invoice of USD 60,000 for \"[o]ur assistance in the signature of the Memorandum of Understanding for the Simandou North and South iron ore deposits in the Republic of Guinea\".1016 On the same day, FMA International Trading Pty Ltd sent an invoice of USD 65,000, with a request for the payment of the balance of USD 60,000 for exactly the same services as CW France.1017 Both companies belong to Pentler's officials Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy. On the same day, Mr. Tchelet gave instructions that these amounts be paid by BSGR TS on behalf of BSGR Guinea BVI and accounted for as expenses \"acquisition costs-investment\".1018\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n809.\n\nIn addition, there is proof that BSGR TS remitted to Pentler (through FMA) USD 250,000 in May 2006.1019 Although on its face this payment appeared tied to the award of the 13 bauxite permits, Mr. Struik stated that it \"had nothing to do with bauxite permits\" and that it \"was the first down payment on the $500,000\".1020\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 165:15-16 and 19-21 (Struik). See also: Tr. (Merits), Day 4, 168:5-15 (Struik).\n\n810.\n\nEvidence on record also demonstrates that, on 4 April 2006, Mr. Tchelet instructed his staff to pay Mr. Cilins USD 10,000 for \"securing the bauxite permits\".1021 Here again, according to Mr. Struik's testimony, this payment was rather for Mr. Cilins' assistance \"with an iron ore MOU, arranging Nissan cars for the group, and assisting with the set-up of the villa and office\".1022 Here too, considering Mr. Struik's testimony, the Tribunal is consequently inclined to attribute this payment to Pentler's services in relation to North and South Simandou.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nStruik (CWS-12), para. 20.\n\n811.\n\nOn 28 March 2008, BSGR Steel and Pentler entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\"), whereby BSGR Steel agreed to pay Pentler USD 22 million in four instalments for its 17.65% shareholding in BSGR Guinea BVI: USD 3 million by 15 April 2008, USD 1 million by 15 June 2008, USD 9 million by 15 April 2009, and USD 9 million by 15 April 2010.1023 Clause 5 of the SPA further provided for a settlement of USD 8 million \"in the event of BSGR Steel realizing a profit in excess of US$1 Billion\" and clause 6 stated that Pentler would continue for another five years to \"advise and act as consultant\".1024\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nContrat de cession d'actions entre BSGR Steel et Pentler, 28 mars 2008, clauses 5 and 6 (Exh. R-219).\n\n812.\n\nBSGR TS paid the first instalment of USD 3 million on 15 April 2008 and the second instalment of USD 1 million on 16 June 2008.1025 The third instalment, which was due on 15 April 2009, was not paid on time. On 21 April 2009, Pentler requested an explanation for the default and payment within 15 days.1026 On that day, Mr. Tchelet gave the following instructions to his staff:\n\n\"Please remove the USD3m and 1m purchase fees paid to Pentler from this report ASAP. It should not be included in the Guinea costs report.\n\nI have given the report to our local accountant Tatiana **after having removed the row of the 17.65% purchase fees**. Please note that the report should be sent from now on to Tatiana and myself on a regular basis but without any reference to **17.65% purchase fees**.\"1027\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n813.\n\nMr. Tchelet reiterated his instructions on 26 April 2009:\n\n\"Also under no circumstances should any details relating to payments to Pentler, past or pending or future be sent to anyone inside Guinea without speaking with me first.\"1028\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n814.\n\nOn 25 July 2009, BSGR TS and Pentler rescheduled the outstanding instalments amounting to twice USD 9 million: USD 4 million would be settled immediately, USD 5 million by 31 December 2009, and USD 9 million by 15 April 2011.1029 On 28 July 2009, BSGR TS paid USD 4 million to Pentler.1030 Following the sale by BSGR of 51% of its shares to Vale on 17 May 2010, Windpoint, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands used by the BSGR Group to make bank transfers, transferred USD 22 million to Pentler.1031 According to the Respondent, this amount corresponds to the remainder owing under the 25 July 2009 agreement (5 and 9 million) plus USD 8 million provided in clause 5 of the SPA. In sum, the record evidences that Pentler received USD 30 million between 15 April 2008 and 17 May 2010. This amount corresponds to the total instalments of USD 22 million plus USD 8 million in the event of a profit exceeding USD 1 billion provided in the SPA.1032\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nContrat de cession d'actions entre BSGR Steel et Pentler, 28 mars 2008, clause 5 (Exh. R-219).\n\n815.\n\nFinally, it is noteworthy in the present context that the documentation used in relation to these payments complicates tracing. Indeed, instead of invoices from Pentler, the Claimants accepted invoices from different companies of Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy, such as FMA or CW France. Payments also appeared linked to services in relation to other mining rights, such as bauxite permits, when they in reality were for securing the exploration permits in North and South Simandou. For instance, Mr. Struik stated that FMA's 10 May 2006 invoice for \"assistance and consulting\" in respect of the bauxite permits in the amount USD 250,000 was in fact part of the consideration due under the 14 February 2006 agreement for achieving the first milestone.1033 The position is similar in respect of the USD 10,000 paid to Mr. Cilins allegedly for the bauxite permits but actually for Simandou.1034 *Messrs. Bah, Tour\u00e9 and Daou*\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 165:15-16 and 19-21 (Struik). Mr. Struik also stated remembering discussions between Messrs. Noy and Oron confirming that the USD 250,000 was not for the bauxite permits, but meant to be the first instalment for the first milestone: \"Q. Is it you [sic] testimony today that when [you say], \"Michael also phoned me saying that we need to process the 'first payment' now\", he wasn't talking about bauxite, he was talking about iron ore? A. Because \u2013 exactly. Michael Noy had complained about the fact that he had not been paid, and he was discussing this with Oron. I know for a fact that they were doing this in these discussions because sometimes there were heated discussions in the office, and I know this was between Pentler and them because they started talking Hebrew and they get very excited, okay? So\". Tr. (Merits), Day 4, 168:5-15 (Struik).\n\n[REDACTED] See paragraph 810 above.\n\n816.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9 signed a receipt confirming that they had received USD 425,000 on 20 February 2006, the day when they entered into the contract with Pentler.1035 This amount corresponds to the first milestone with respect to Simandou.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n817.\n\nIn 2009 and 2010, Mr. Bah claimed additional amounts from BSGR, but there is no evidence that he was paid. Specifically, on 30 November 2009, Mr. Bah requested that BSGR pay him USD 15.2 million (corresponding to USD 12,025,000 - USD 425,000 + USD 3,600,000)1036 in a letter addressed to Mr. Struik as General Director of BSGR and to Mr. Cilins as Director of Pentler. The letter referred to the 20 February 2006 contract concluded with Pentler \"under the supervision of Marc Struik\".1037 The letter added that, failing payment, Mr. Bah would start legal proceedings against BSGR (not Pentler).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n818.\n\nBSGR answered on 3 December 2009, stating that there had never been a connection between Mr. Bah and BSGR. The answer continued that, if he were to persist with his extortion attempt, BSGR would bring a claim against him.1038 On 31 December 2009, BSGR wrote to Pentler, expressing its concern that the \"matter of Mr. Bah has not been resolved\".1039 Mr. Noy replied on the same day that Pentler would \"take care of this matter\" and do its best \"to get Mr. Bah not to disturb BSGR and its operation as a part of [Pentler's] promise to Beni [i.e. Mr. Steinmetz]\".1040\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n819.\n\nOn 5 May 2010, Mr. Bah again claimed USD 15.2 million from BSGR.1041 He stressed that Mr. Struik had recommended the conclusion of the 20 February 2006 contract and that it was thanks to this contract that BSGR was able to exercise its activities in Guinea, and ultimately to sell 51% of its capital to Vale for USD 2.5 billion.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n820.\n\nOn 12 May 2010, Mr. Bah then wrote to Mr. Cilins referring to a telephone conversation they had on 4 May 2010.1042 In that letter, Mr. Bah again sought the payment of USD 15.2 million and rejected an offer of USD 1 million, which Mr. Cilins had apparently made. Interestingly, the letter referred to a document that Mr. Bah allegedly signed to exclude him from \"the transaction\".1043 This document appears to be an undated amendment to the 20 February 2006 protocol, signed by Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9 (but not by Pentler), and which Mr. Noy attached to a message dated 7 June 2009 sent to the email account of Mr. Barnett, the legal director or in-house counsel of the BSGR Group, and addressed to \"Beni\" [i.e. Mr. Steinmetz].1044 In that email, Mr. Noy referred to a meeting with Mr. Steinmetz and confirmed that he checked \"the issue\" with Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9. He further said that both had agreed to release Pentler from \"any responsibility, agreements, engagements and obligations\" and that an agreement had been reached between Matinda, i.e. Ms. Tour\u00e9's company, and Mr. Bah providing that \"[a]ll responsibilities with regard to [Mr. Bah] are of Mrs. TOURE\".1045 Mr. Noy further stated that \"[i]n any case, BSGR has no responsibility whatsoever with regard to Mr BAH\".1046 In other words, on the face of it, Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9 agreed to assign all of Pentler\u2019s obligations owed to them to Ms. Tour\u00e9. In this context, it is noteworthy that Ms. Tour\u00e9 concluded a series of contracts with Pentler in the course of the summer of 2010 whereby Ms. Tour\u00e9 agreed to assume responsibility for any claims by institutions, companies or Guinean individuals against Pentler and/or its partners.1047\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n(\"Tu dis que j'ai sign\u00e9 un document m'excluant de la transaction\") [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED] he amendment reads in relevant part as follows: \"Monsieur Aboubacar BAH et Monsieur Ibrahima Sory II TOURE se d\u00e9sistent sans r\u00e9serve ni condition d'aucune sorte de tout engagement ou obligation contract\u00e9 avec la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 PENTLER HOLDINGS Ltd au profit de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 MATINDA and Co.

As for the settlement of the first milestone payment due to Mr. Daou, the only indication on record is found in Mr. Bah\u2019s letter of 5 May 2010, according to which on 20 February 2006 at the Novotel in Conakry in the presence of Mr. Struik, Mr. Noy gave USD 75,000 to Mr. Daou in cash at the same time as USD 425,000 to Mr. Bah and Mr. Tour\u00e9.1048\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n822.\n\nFinally, it is undisputed that Mr. Tour\u00e9 was employed by BSGR Guinea since 2006 and that he received a regular salary as well as a bonus of USD 450,000 in 2010.1049\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 107-109; C-PHB1, paras. 179-180; [REDACTED]\n\n*Ms. Tour\u00e9*\n-----------\n\n823.\n\nGuinea argues that the record proves that the Claimants paid at least USD 9.5 million to Ms. Tour\u00e9, either directly or through intermediaries, in return for her influence in securing the disputed mining rights. The Claimants deny any involvement with her or with the payments that Pentler made to her either directly or through Adam Schiffman, a US lawyer managing the company Olympia Title. They also dispute having made cash payments or gifts to Ms. Tour\u00e9.\n\n824.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s allegations relate to two sets of transfers: one set of USD 4 million made through Mr. Boutros and one set of USD 5.5 million through Pentler directly or indirectly.\n\n825.\n\nStarting with the first series of transfers, according to the Respondent, BSGR paid USD 4 million to Ms. Tour\u00e9 through Ghassan Boutros as follows:\n\n- USD 1 million: USD 998,000 on 28 August 2009 and USD 2,000 on 20 December 2009;\n\n- USD 1 million (or USD 998,870) in February 2010; and\n\n- USD 2 million on 18 May 2010.\n\n826.\n\nWith respect to the first payments totaling USD 1 million, the Respondent argues that the scheme put in place consisted in fabricating invoices for caterpillar equipment that was never delivered.1050 The record indicates that, on 17 August 2009, Joseph \"Yossie\" Tchelet, BSGR's Strategic Financial Specialist, gave instructions to his accountant to transfer USD 1.3 million to Mr. Boutros as \"consulting fee\".1051 On 18 August 2009, Mr. Boutros drew up an invoice on the letterhead of his company LMS for two caterpillars and a generator in the amount of USD 1.3 million.1052 On the same day, BSGR, through BSGR TS, paid the amount invoiced by Boutros as \"consulting fees\", leaving the accounting line \"purchase vehicles\" empty.1053 On 28 August 2009, Ms. Tour\u00e9, on the letterhead of her company Matinda, created an invoice of USD 998,000 for caterpillars.1054 Then, on 3 September 2009, Mr. Boutros having received the money from BSGR honored Ms. Tour\u00e9's invoice ordering his bank to transfer USD 998,000 to Ms. Tour\u00e9's account.1055 Later, on 20 December 2009, Ms. Tour\u00e9 created a second invoice for the missing USD 2,000 and, although there is no documentary evidence to this effect, she claimed having received it.1056\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 299-307.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nFacture de Matinda, 28 ao\u00fbt 2009 (Exh.

The cumulation of the concealment through a fictitious sale of heavy equipment when Ms. Tour\u00e9 had no prior dealings in this type of equipment nor did prior business with Mr. Boutros; the absence of any trace of actual caterpillars or documentation showing delivery;1065 the timing of the transfers first from BSGR to Mr. Boutros on 18 August and then from the latter to Ms. Tour\u00e9 on 3 September in conjunction with her \"attestation\" of 2 August 2009,1066 all of this leaves no doubts as to the true nature of these transactions.\n\nThe Claimants' assertion that the \"two Caterpillars *were* delivered\" and that \"Boutros supplied such equipment\" is not evidenced by documents. Reply, para. 75. The Guinean import declaration filled out by LMS and dated 17 August 2009 only shows that an import request was made, not that the equipment was actually imported or delivered.

Yet, there is evidence of BSGR's internal payment instruction for an amount corresponding to the second instalment; Mr. Boutros' invoice at about the same time for the same amount; the fact that the same caterpillar scheme was used and that there is no indication of the existence or delivery of such machinery; and Ms. Tour\u00e9's statement that she received the money. On these facts and because of the connection between the three instalments, the Tribunal is inclined to find that BSGR did make the payment to Ms. Tour\u00e9. Moreover, the record contains no request for a missing payment, which one would expect if one of the three instalments had remained outstanding.\n\n833.\n\n[REDACTED]1074 [REDACTED]1075\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n834.\n\nMr. Boutros stated before the Swiss prosecutor that a director of operations of BSGR Guinea told him to assist \"a certain\" Mr. Camara to transfer the USD 2 million in cash \"*sur le compte BSGR aupr\u00e8s de la Banque Populaire Maroco Guin\u00e9enne de Conakry.1076* According to Mr. Boutros, Mr. Camara, who is not othwerwise identified, asked him to sign the invoice since he did not have an identity card: *\"Il est exact qu\u2019en proc\u00e9dant ainsi je faisais comme si c\u2019\u00e9tait moi qui avait d\u00e9pos\u00e9 USD 2 millions\".1077* Mr. Boutros also stated that he thought the monies were for BSGR and did not verify the identity of the recipient: \"J'\u00e9tais persuad\u00e9 que l'argent allait sur leur compte\".1078 He further said that he gave the receipt to BSGR: \"le re\u00e7u que m'a remis la banque je l'ai imm\u00e9diatement remis \u00e0 la comptabilit\u00e9 de BSGR, sans garder une copie pour moi\".1079 He finally testified that: \"je pense aujourd'hui [avoir] \u00e9t\u00e9 utilis\u00e9 par BSGR pour virer de l'argent sur des comptes que je ne connaissais pas\".1080\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n835.\n\nWhether Mr. Boutros was duped or not is irrelevant here. What matters is that the money came from BSGR as evidenced by the fact that Mr. Boutros handed the receipt to BSGR, and that USD 2 million were transferred on Ms. Tour\u00e9's bank account for unspecified services.1081\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n836.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the documentary evidence shows - and Mr. Tchelet confirmed -that BSGR Treasury transferred USD 3,137,000 to Mr. Boutros between 16 February and 21 April 2010.1082 Mr. Tchelet also stated that he should have exercised more caution with respect to these money transfers.1083 In fact, he provided a list of the monies transferred to a certain Mr. Adama Sidibe, who was Mr. Boutros' partner in LMS.1084\n\nTchelet (CWS-11), para. 17.\n\nTr.

[REDACTED]\n\n837.\n\nThese payments were made on an \"urgent\" basis prior to receiving the corresponding invoices.1085 It also appears that Mr. Tchelet instructed his accountants to allocate these payments as consulting fees.1086 Mr. Tchelet\u2019s explanations at the hearing were not really convincing.1087 It is not clear why these payments had to be made on an urgent basis, nor why instructions of payment were given before any invoices were received. Nor is it clear why Mr. Boutros would be a \"prime example of a non-employee whose payments were recorded as consulting fees\", as the Claimants argued.1088 The Claimants\u2019 explanation that the \"consulting\" category was \"often used as the default category where no other category applied\"1089 is misleading, since the purchase of caterpillars would squarely fall within the accounting line referring to \"Purchase vehicles\". However, this line was left blank. Similarly, the Claimants\u2019 explanation that the \"consulting\" category would be used where the \"correct category was not known prior to receipt of an invoice\" is also misleading.1090 For instance, Mr. Tchelet transferred to his staff the invoice from Mr. Boutros for USD 998,870 which had been classified as \"consulting fees\" without instructing the staff to reclassify the expense.1091 Finally, the Claimants have not provided any explanation why Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s involvement in the delivery of heavy machinery made her \"part of a legitimate commercial transaction\".1092\n\nSee, for instance: [REDACTED]  \n(\"Invoice to follow\") [REDACTED]  \n(\"Ghassan-invoice to follow in due course for allocation purposes\") [REDACTED]  \n(\"the invoice will follow in due course\") [REDACTED]  \n(\"Hi-please load payment amount to USD 212k today to Ghassan \u2013 invoice is pending\") [REDACTED]\n\nSee, for instance: (\"BSGR Guinea needs to make payment tomorrow morning amounting to USD 1,000,000 (One Million United States Dollars) as consulting fees in respect of Ghassan Boutros\") [REDACTED] (\"Hi-attached is the supporting invoice relating to the recent payment to Ghassan as consulting fees last week, slight difference due to bank charges etc, for your records\") [REDACTED] (\"I have been informed this afternoon of a requirement to pay an amount of USD 550,000 as R.A.S. consulting fees in respect of services rendered by Ghassan.

The Claimants' explanation that BSGR's payments to Mr. Boutros were based on a legitimate commercial relationship is not sufficiently substantiated. While Messrs. Avidan and Tchelet stated that Mr. Boutros supplied \"various equipment and machinery to BSGR\",1093 this has not been corroborated, for instance, by any cogent evidence showing that the caterpillars have actually been delivered. Nor did the Claimants provide a cogent explanation for the round figures of the amounts paid to Mr. Boutros.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 188; Tr. (Merits), Day 9, 197:3-6 (Avidan); Tr. (Merits), Day 3, 162:11-163:7 (Tchelet).\n\n839.\n\nIn summary, on the basis of the record, the Tribunal is satisfied that, between 3 September 2009 and 18 May 2010, Ms. Tour\u00e9 received from BSGR (through Mr. Boutros) the USD 4 million mentioned in her 2 August 2009 \"attestation\" (the \"2 August 2009 Attestation\"), whilst of that amount only USD 2,998,000 are proven by documentary evidence.\n\n840.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the review of the second set of payments. The Respondent asserts that, in addition to the payments just discussed, Ms. Tour\u00e9 received USD 5.5 million following her denunciation of the 2 August 2009 \"attestation\" on 8 June 2010.1094 It submits that Ms. Tour\u00e9 sought to renegotiate her compensation following the joint venture agreement with Vale in April 2010. For Guinea, this effort culminated in Pentler and Ms. Tour\u00e9 signing a new contract on 3 August 2010 providing for the payment of USD 5.5 million.\n\nLetter from bailiff Nassif Moussi to BSGR, 8 June 2010 (Exh. C-114).\n\n841.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial and Rejoinder, the Respondent pointed to the following flows of funds: USD 399,940 were transferred between 22 July and 15 August 2010 by Messrs. Cilins and Lev Ran to Ms. Tour\u00e9; USD 3 million were transferred on 5 August 2010 from BSGR to Pentler; USD 1.5 million were transferred on 22 March 2011 from BSGR to Pentler; USD 1.5 million were transferred between 31 March and 12 April 2011 from Pentler on the bank account of Olympia Title, a company administered by Mr. Schiffman; USD 3.5 million were transferred on 12 September 2011 from Pentler to Olympia Title; USD 500,000 were transferred on 11 October 2011 from Olympia Title to Ms. Tour\u00e9; USD 400,000 were transferred on 11 January 2012 from Olympia Title to Ms. Tour\u00e9; USD 936,451.02 were transferred on 14 May 2012 from Olympia Title to Ms. Tour\u00e9. These flows, which are corroborated by documentary evidence, total payments to Ms. Tour\u00e9 of USD 2,236,391.02 being paid by Pentler directly or indirectly through Olympia Title.1095\n\nCM, paras. 502-520; Rejoinder, paras. 425-437; Ch\u00e8ques de Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cilins en faveur de Mme Tour\u00e9, 27 juillet et 5 ao\u00fbt 2010 (Exh.

These questions are answered by supplemental evidence which Guinea filed with its post-hearing brief.1096\n\nR-PHB1, paras. 321-337.\n\n843.\n\nThat evidence includes three differently annotated versions of an email dated 22 June 2011 of Mr. Noy to Mr. Cilins, which email contains two columns; the first is entitled \"Mamadi\" and the second \"Yossi\". Both columns list sums for an aggregate of approximately USD 5.5 million. It is undisputed that \"Mamadi\" refers to Mamadie Tour\u00e9 and that \"Yossi\" refers to Mr. Joseph Tchelet, BSGR's financial specialist. This evidence shows that, contrary to BSGR, Pentler maintained a record of the payments made for a total of USD 5.5 million. This evidence also demonstrates a clear link between BSGR, Pentler and Ms. Tour\u00e9, as well as the implication of Adam Schiffman who managed Olympia Title.\n\n844.\n\nThe first version of the email from Michael Noy to Frederic Cilins reads as follows:1097\n\nSubject:[No Subject]\n\nFrom: [REDACTED]\n\nTo: [REDACTED]\n\nDate: Wed 22 Jun 2011 12:39:37\n\nmamadi\n\n500 us\n\n1900 gui\n\n100 gui\n\n1500 adam\n\n1419.2 adam\n\ntotal 5419.2\n\nbalance 80.8\n\nyossi\n\n500 pen\n\n1900 gui\n\n100 gui\n\n1500 pen\n\n1500 gob\n\ntotal 5.500\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n845.\n\nThe second annotated version of that email reads as follows:1098\n\nSubject: [No Subject]\n\nFrom: [REDACTED]\n\nTo: REDACTED]\n\nDate: Wednesday, June 22, 2011 12:39 PM\n\nmamadi\n\n500 us\n\n1900 gui\n\n100 gui\n\n. 1500 adam\n\n1419.2 adam\n\n1000000 FRED\n\ntotal 5419.2\n\nbalance 80.8\n\nyossi\n\n500 pen\n\n1900 gui\n\n100 gui\n\n1500 pen\n\n1500 gob\n\ntotal 5.500\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n846.\n\nFinally, the third annotated version reads as follows:1099\n\n***MAMADI***\n\n500 USD\n\n1,900 GUI\n\n100 GUI\n\n500 USD-ADAM\n\n1419,2 USD-ADAM\n\n1,000,000 USD-FRED\n\n**TOTAL 5419,2**\n\n**BALANCE 80,0**\n\n**MAMADI BALANCE 1,919,200**\n\nEXPENSES ADAM 70,000\n\nTO**TAL\\_\\_\\_\\_ 1,849,200**\n\nFRED 80,800\n\n**TOTAL 1,930,000**\n\n500 000 ADAM --> U.S.A Account.\n\n***YOSSI***\n\n500 PEN\n\n1,900 GUI\n\n100 GUI\n\n1,500 PEN\n\n1,500 GOB\n\n**TOTAL 5,500**\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n847.\n\nThe Claimants responded that the payments listed under \"Yossi\" were legitimate payments from BSGR to Pentler and that the use of Mr. Tchelet\u2019s name in this email \"is not evidence that BSGR used Pentler to make separate payments to Mamadie Tour\u00e9\".1100 The Tribunal disagrees. It finds the Respondent\u2019s explanations about these transfers convincing and considers that this email and the annotations show that BSGR paid Ms. Tour\u00e9 nearly USD 5.5 million, specifically USD 5,419,200.\n\nC-PHB2, para. 98.\n\n848.\n\nMore precisely, the Respondent provided the following explanations on these money transfers, starting with the column entitled \"Mamadi\". According to Guinea, the entry \"**500 US**\" corresponds to USD 500,000 paid by Mr. Cilins and Lev Ran between 22 July 2010 and 15 August 2010 to Ms. Tour\u00e9, of which the Respondent could retrace USD 399,940.1101 [REDACTED].1102 [REDACTED]1103\n\nR-PHB1, para. 328.

The Respondent believes that this means that the money came directly from BSGR Guinea. It is true that there is no evidence that Mr. Avidan paid USD 1.9 million and then USD 100,000 to Mr. Ciss\u00e9. However, there is also no plausible explanation either for how Mr. Ciss\u00e9 would have obtained such large amounts of money. [REDACTED] This being said, the entries \"1900 GUI\" and \"100 GUI\" in the three annotated versions of the email between Mr. Noy and Mr. Cilins are striking and, failing any other sensible explanation, may well suggest that BSGR paid USD 2 million to Ms. Tour\u00e9.\n\n854.\n\nThe Respondent further explains that the entry **\"1500 adam\"** in the first email version corresponds to payments made by BSGR through Adam Schiffman, who managed Olympia Title.1109 [REDACTED]1110\n\nR-PHB1, para. 329.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n855.\n\nThe evidence shows that, through Windpoint, BSGR transferred USD 1.5 million to Pentler on 22 March 2011.1111 However, the Respondent argues that the payments were not made as initially assumed, as the three different versions of the Pentler's accounting show. On 6 July 2011, Ms. Tour\u00e9 requested that Mr. Cilins pay her USD 1 million, which the latter did instructing the bank to transfer that amount from the account of Gobain Finance Corp.1112\n\nInstruction de paiement de Windpoint \u00e0 Pentler pour 1,5 million de dollars, 22 mars 2011 (Exh. R-353).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n856.\n\nThis fact is reflected in the second annotated version of the email with a new handwritten entry \"1000000 FRED\" and a modification of the entry \"1500 adam\" to \"500 adam\". The record corroborates that Ms. Tour\u00e9 received close to USD 1 million, precisely USD 991,495.25, on 21 July 2011.1113 According to Guinea, the difference of USD 8,504.70 represents bank fees,1114 which the Tribunal finds plausible. The evidence further shows that Olympia Title, i.e. Adam Schiffman's company, wired USD 500,000 to Ms. Tour\u00e9 on 11 October 2011.1115\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nR-PHB1, para. 331.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n857.\n\nFinally, the entry **\"1419.2 adam\"** corresponds to USD 1,419,200 that were paid by Mr. Schiffman to Ms. Tour\u00e9 through Olympia Title. The Respondent acknowledges that the documents only record payments for a total of USD 1,336,451.02, from Olympia Title to Ms. Tour\u00e9 between 11 January 2012 and 14 May 2012, for a total amount, which is slightly lower than the sum listed in the email. These payments were made in two transfers of USD 150,000 and USD 250,000 on 11 January 20121116 and one of USD 936,451.02 on 14 May 2012.1117\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n858.\n\nIn summary, with respect to the second set of payments, the record shows that Ms. Tour\u00e9 actually received from Pentler directly or indirectly through Olympia Title USD 5,419,200 (out of the USD 5.5 mio.), out of which USD 2,236,391.02 can be traced through wire transfers and/or checks.\n\n859.\n\nAs a result, adding the first and second series of payments, it is established that BSGR paid Ms. Tour\u00e9 **USD 9,419,200**between August 2009 and May 2012. Out of that sum, payments for USD 5,234,391.02 are proven by wire transfers and checks and the remainder through other evidence.\n\n860.\n\nBy contrast, there is insufficient evidence to find that Ms. Tour\u00e9 received additional cash payments and other gifts. In particular, absent further evidence, the Tribunal cannot rely on Ms. Tour\u00e9's statements that her half-brother gave her USD 200,000 after the award of the North and South Simandou exploration permits.1118 Neither are her statements sufficient to accept that Ms. Tour\u00e9 received from Mr. Avidan a necklace or a gold chain with seven diamonds.1119\n\nD\u00e9claration de Mme Tour\u00e9, 2 d\u00e9cembre 2013, para. 15 (Exh. R-35).\n\nD\u00e9claration de Mme Tour\u00e9, 2 d\u00e9cembre 2013, para. 27-28 (Exh. R-35).\n\n*Mr. Thiam*\n-----------\n\n861.\n\nBSGR does not deny that it reimbursed Minister Thiam's travel expenses of USD 4,680.02 in April 2009 for a round trip to Paris1120 and of USD 10,744.66 in November 2009 for a trip in September 2009 to attend the wedding of Mr. Steinmetz's daughter in Tel Aviv and for a one-way ticket from Istanbul to Hong Kong.1121 These favors appear suspicious considering that Mr. Thiam became Minister of Mines in January 2009, that he confirmed the validity of BSGR's exploration permits over Blocks 1 and 2 in May of that year (see further below) and fast-tracked the issuance of Base Convention later in December 2009 of the same year.1122 Mr. Thiam's explanation that he \"simply caught a ride\" on Mr. Steinmetz's plane on several occasions for official missions, including specifically his ten-day trip to Paris, is contradicted by the evidence in the record, which shows that BSGR reimbursed a round trip with Air France from Conakry to Paris.1123 Moreover, there is no evidence in the record corroborating Minister Thiam's evasive statement that he was on an official mission on that occasion.1124\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nThiam (CWS-5), paras. 55, 70.\n\n[REDACTED] Minister Thiam flew from Conakry to Paris on 10 April 2009 and returned to Conakry on 20 April 2009. The travel expenses were invoiced on 23 April 2009 by the office of travel agency Diesenhaus-Unitours in Haifa, Israel.\n\nThiam (CWS-5), para. 89.4.\n\n*Technical Commission*\n----------------------\n\n862.\n\nBSGR does not deny that it paid the members of the Technical Commission set up by Mr. Thiam in December 2009 USD 1,000 each to negotiate the terms of a mining convention. Compared to other payments made by BSGR to Guineans, these amounts may seem insignificant. Yet, they represent five times the amount of the monthly salary of the committee members and twice the salary of a prime minister.1125 Accordingly, these amounts cannot be considered *de minimis.* The Claimants' argument that \"senior Government officials such as the Committee members earned considerably more than the average wage\" does not detract from the fact that the committee members received for two weeks' work twice the compensation of the Guinean Prime Minister for one month. The fact that the Claimants were \"open\" about these payments in the Statement of Claim does not change that fact either.1126\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 6, 12:17-13:16 (Souar\u00e9).\n\nReply, para. 379(i)-(ii), referring to Memorial, para. 75; Struik (CWS-2), para. 82.\n\n863.\n\n[REDACTED]1127 This raises the question whether such daily allowances were common practice. Asked about it, Mr. Souare, who was Prime Minister at that time, denied that such payments were customary or otherwise legal:\n\n\"Q. [...] There are elements in the file where some people had been speaking about a customary practice relating to review commissions, or commissions that are to examine investor applications, which would be a standard practice for those investors, i.e. to pay certain amounts to the members of the commission that examines their titles. In your experience as Minister and Prime Minister, is this normal practice, that an investor should pay members of a commission that are there to examine the mining titles?\n\nA. It's neither legal within the Mining Code nor traditional. This is not a practice that I experienced as Minister or Prime Minister.\"1128\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 6, 11:19-12:7 (Souar\u00e9).\n\n864.\n\nIn the light of these explanations and considering the disproportionate amount of the payments when compared to the salary of the Prime Minister, the Tribunal cannot but find that these payments raise red flags.\n\n*Other gifts*\n-------------\n\n865.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that Mr. Cilins gave a watch with diamonds worth \"several thousand dollars\" to President Cont\u00e9 on BSGR's behalf, that BSGR gave a diamond-encrusted miniature car to President Cont\u00e9 and another one to Minister Souar\u00e9, and that BSGR gave President Cont\u00e9 two Land Cruisers.1129 The Claimants contend that they did not know about the watch given to President Cont\u00e9 and that Mr. Cilins did not act on their behalf.1130 They further qualify as \"preposterous\" the allegation that offering a model car to President Cont\u00e9 was a bribe, since an identical car had been accepted by Minister Souar\u00e9 during the official ceremony for the signing of the MoU on 20 February 2006.1131 Finally, they deny having offered two Land Cruisers to President Cont\u00e9, insisting that there is no evidence of these gifts and that Ms. Tour\u00e9's statements are unreliable.1132\n\nCM, para. 824 (Translated from the French); Rejoinder, para. 121; R-PHB1, para. 462.\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 96-97.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 98.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 99.\n\n866.\n\nIt is undisputed that Mr. Cilins offered an expensive watch to President Cont\u00e9, but the circumstances surrounding this present or the value of the watch are unclear. On 5 October 2011, Mr. Cilins apparently told Steven Fox from Veracity Worldwide that he brought a \"diamond-encrusted watch\" to \"a meeting with President Cont\u00e9\", which meeting was also attended by Messrs. Oron and Tour\u00e9 and \"three or four other BSGR representatives\".1133 According to that account, Mr. Oron presented the watch to President Cont\u00e9 and Mr. Cilins \"speculated\" that it was worth USD 60,000 with the diamonds and about USD 2,000 to 3,000 without them.1134 In 2012, Mr. Cilins similarly stated that he gave a watch to President Cont\u00e9 \"at one meeting\", but on that occasion he mentioned that the watch was worth less than USD 5,000.1135 He further said then that he had acted on his own, and had paid for the watch. He added that BSGR had not been informed of this initiative and that he had never requested the reimbursement of his expense.1136\n\nRapport d'entretien avec M. Cilins, 5 octobre 2011 (probable), pp. 4-5 (Exh. R-165).\n\nRapport d'entretien avec M. Cilins, 5 octobre 2011 (probable), p. 5 (Exh. R-165).\n\nAttestation de M. Cilins, 26 novembre 2012, p. 2 (Exh. R-169) (Translated from the French).\n\nAttestation de M. Cilins, 26 novembre 2012, p. 2 (Exh. R-169).\n\n867.\n\nConsidering these contradictory statements and the absence of additional evidence, the Tribunal is of the view that there is insufficient proof that the Claimants bribed President Cont\u00e9 with a watch and that Mr. Cilins acted on behalf of the Claimants.\n\n868.\n\nTurning now to the miniature car, the Claimants brought a replica of the diamond-encrusted and gold plated miniature car to the Merits Hearing, of which a photograph was taken and added to the record.1137 It is undisputed that the Claimants gave one such miniature car to President Cont\u00e9 and another one to Minister Souar\u00e9. It is unclear when exactly President Cont\u00e9 accepted this gift.1138 As for Minister Souar\u00e9, he confirmed that he accepted the miniature car at the ceremony for the signing of the MoU on 20 February 2006 and stated that he forwarded the gift to President Cont\u00e9.1139 [REDACTED]1140 In the circumstances, the Tribunal has insufficient evidence to conclude that these gifts amount to a bribe as opposed to an admissible corporate gift. Finally, with respect to the Land Cruisers, the Tribunal notes that Ms. Tour\u00e9 stated that she received two Land Cruisers from Mr. Avidan as a gift from Mr. Steinmetz when the application for the Blocks 1 & 2 permits were pending.1141 Accordingly, these alleged gifts did not relate to North and South Simandou and the Tribunal will address them further below.\n\nPhotograph of Model Car (Exh. C-357).\n\nFor instance, the Tribunal notes that Ms. Tour\u00e9 stated that Mr. Steinmetz offered a diamond-encrusted miniature car to President Cont\u00e9 at an undated meeting in Brameya and the context of her statement suggests that this was in the context of negotiations surrounding Blocks 1 & 2, i.e. around 2008.

R-35).\n\n*Conclusion regarding the Zogota mining permits and the Base Convention*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n869.\n\nTo conclude, there is evidence showing that BSGR paid Pentler, its principals or another company related to the principals (such as FMA and CW France) various amounts in 2006 (USD 385,000, including USD 125,000 in February 2006, USD 10,000 in April 2006 and USD 250,000 in May 2006) and between 2008 and 2010 (USD 30 million, including USD 3 million in April 2008, USD 1 million in June 2008, USD 4 million in July 2009, USD 22 million in May 2010). The record further contains evidence of a payment from Pentler (or its principals) to Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9 (USD 425,000 on 20 February 2006), as well as the payment of a bonus of USD 450,000 by BSGR to Mr. Tour\u00e9 in 2010 in addition to his regular salary. In addition, there is direct evidence in the form of wire transfers and/or checks that Ms. Tour\u00e9 received USD 5,234,391.02 between August 2009 and May 2012, although the record actually shows that she received USD 9,419,200 in that period. There is also evidence showing that BSGR reimbursed Mr. Thiam's travel expenses (USD 15,424.68, including USD 4,680.02 in April 2009 and USD 10,744.66 in November 2009). Finally, it is undisputed that the 20 members of the Technical Commission tasked with reviewing the feasibility study and negotiating the terms of the mining concession for Zogota received each USD 1,000 from BSGR for a total amount of USD 20,000.\n\n870.\n\nAt this stage, the Tribunal finds that BSGR made payments in a total amount of USD 30,835,000 to intermediaries (including USD 30,385,000 to Pentler and USD 450,000 to Mr. Tour\u00e9). It is further established that, through intermediaries such as Pentler, Mr. Schiffman or Mr. Boutros, BSGR arranged for payments of USD 9,419,200 to Ms. Tour\u00e9 and of USD 425,000 to Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9. Finally, it is established that BSGR paid government officials in the amount of USD 35,424.68 (including USD 15,424.68 to Mr. Thiam and USD 20,000 to the members of the Technical Commission). The question then arises what qualifications these intermediaries had and what services these payments were meant to remunerate.\n\n(b) Qualifications of intermediaries used by BSGR\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n871.\n\nIt is commonly accepted that the lack of qualifications of intermediaries can constitute a red flag indicative of corrupt practices. The Respondent alleges that neither the Pentler officials, nor Ms. Tour\u00e9, nor Mr. Tour\u00e9 had any qualifications in the mining sector and that their services were only retained because of their proximity to President Cont\u00e9.\n\n*Pentler*\n---------\n\n872.\n\nIt is undisputed that Pentler operated on the West African \"grey market\" since 2004 through their companies FMA International and CW France.1142 Through its West African network, it apparently gained access to President Cont\u00e9's first wife, Ms. Henriette Cont\u00e9.1143\n\nCM, para. 119.\n\nCM, para. 121.\n\n873.\n\nThe Claimants concede that in 2006 Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy \"were not experienced in the mining sector\".1144 This being so, even absent any sector-specific knowledge, consultants can provide relevant experience in other fields, such as providing help in setting up operations in a country. However, the Claimants have not provided any explanations on the roles played by Messrs. Lev Ran or Noy,1145 other than that they were acquaintances of Mr. Oron who introduced BSGR to the Guinean mining sector. Although he had no mining experience, Mr. Cilins appears to have played a somewhat more important role.1146 Mr. Struik, for instance, testified that Mr. Cilins was useful at the beginning when he did not yet speak French,1147 without however providing other details on qualifications justifying retaining his services. Mr. Avidan further stated that Mr. Cilins' initial role was to merely deal with \"formalities and practicalities on the ground\".1148\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 116. Mr. Cilins stated in 2012 that his activities in West Africa since 2000 centered on buying and selling pharmaceuticals and that he only got interested in mining in Guinea after having heard from BSGR's existence: \"En Guin\u00e9e, mon activit\u00e9 a notamment port\u00e9 sur l'achat et la revente de produits pharmaceutiques. En 2005, j'ai appris l'existence de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSGR et compris l'int\u00e9r\u00eat qu'elle pourrait prendre au d\u00e9veloppement de projets miniers en Guin\u00e9e. Ayant ainsi une possibilit\u00e9 d'acc\u00e8s au groupe BSGR, je me suis investi dans l'\u00e9tude des probl\u00e8mes miniers en Guin\u00e9e et, fort de ma pr\u00e9sence locale, j'ai propos\u00e9 \u00e0 BSGR de l'assister et de coop\u00e9rer avec elle\". Attestation de M. Cilins, 26 novembre 2012, p. 1 (Exh. R-169).\n\nMr. Struik, for instance, stated that Messrs. Lev Ran and Noy were not \"on the ground\" in the beginning of 2006. Tr. (Merits), Day 4, 113:5-7 (\"Q. As for Mr Noy and Mr Lev Ran, were they on the ground in Guinea with you at the time? A. No, they were not\").\n\n\"Q. And you confirm that Mr Cilins himself had no mining background? A. He had absolutely no mining background. He was a businessman, but nothing in mining at all\". Tr. (Merits), Day 4, 112:20-23 (Struik).\n\nSee, for instance: Tr. (Merits), Day 4, 114:12-14 (Struik).\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 9, 46:9-14 (Avidan).\n\n874.\n\nIn other words, the Claimants have failed to substantiate the qualifications of the Pentler principals which might possibly have justified their level of remuneration.\n\n*Messrs. Bah and Daou*\n----------------------\n\n875.\n\nSimilarly, the Claimants have provided no input on the qualifications of Messrs. Bah and Daou. While they deny any involvement with these two individuals, the record shows that Mr. Struik was involved in the drafting of the Pentler/Bah/Tour\u00e9 protocol (see paragraph 789 above).1149 Nonetheless, Mr. Struik did not indicate why Mr. Bah was promised a remuneration for his \"services, counsel and assistance\" or what qualifications would warrant hiring his services.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*Ms. Tour\u00e9*\n-----------\n\n876.\n\nMs. Tour\u00e9 was born in 1982 in Guinea, and was thus 24 years old in 2006. There is no indication that she received any particular education. [REDACTED]1150 Hence, there is no indication that Ms. Tour\u00e9 had any qualifications in the mining sector at the relevant time.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*Mr. Tour\u00e9*\n-----------\n\n877.\n\nMr. Tour\u00e9 had no qualifications in the mining sector either, as Mr. Struik conceded.1151 He was a journalist when he joined BSGR in 2006.1152 Prior to that, the Claimants note that Mr. Tour\u00e9 assisted \"the Pentler principals with deals in Guinea and introduced them to different industries and traders\".1153 However, they provide no information on the type of industry involved. Mr. Tour\u00e9 first worked for BSGR Guinea as a part time employee in 20061154 and was then hired as Director of External Relations in the following year1155 and finally promoted to the position of Vice-President in 2010. According to Mr. Avidan, Mr. Tour\u00e9 advised BSGR, for instance, to enhance its reputation by visiting local communities.1156 He also sat in the halls of ministries on behalf of Mr. Avidan and told him when he could meet with ministers.1157 In essence, the Claimants\u2019 explanation for retaining the services of Mr. Tour\u00e9 was his \"good contacts\" in business, politics and mining.1158 However, as the Respondent pointed out, Mr. Avidan seemingly contradicted the Claimants\u2019 position and his own written testimony when at the Merits Hearing he denied that Mr. Tour\u00e9 had such contacts.1159 In fact, Mr. Avidan\u2019s oral testimony was evasive on this point. He said that Mr. Tour\u00e9 only knew \"very low-key\" bureaucrats and sought to downplay his prior explanation that Mr. Tour\u00e9 had told him he knew President Cont\u00e9 from the time when he was hiding from the then President Ahmed S\u00e9kou Tour\u00e9.1160\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 208:23-209:1 (Struik).\n\nSee, for instance: (\"Q. [\u2026] he was a journalist, who didn't have any mining background, and who appeared to you to be very well connected in Guinea. Do you agree with those points? A. He appeared like that, yes\") Tr. (Merits), Day 4, 208:20-209:1 (Struik); Avidan (CWS-3), para. 11 (\"Mr Tour\u00e9 was a journalist\"); Counter-Memorial, paras. 175, 830.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 103(iii).\n\nStruik (CWS-2), para. 36.\n\nStruik (CWS-2), para. 37.\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 23.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 101(iii).\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 101(iv).\n\nR-PHB1, para. 343; (\"Q. Okay. But going back to be [sic] Mr Tour\u00e9's role, you found that he had very good contacts locally, didn't he? A. Well, I knew that he knew the country much better than me, for sure. Q. That wasn't my question. You knew that he had very good contacts, right? A. No. No, not necessarily. It depends with whom. The minister at the time that I came, I remember, Dr Sylla, I think he never met him before I came with him to his chamber. Q. But, Mr Avidan, he had good contacts in politics and in business, didn't he? A. No, I don't think so\") Tr. (Merits), Day 9, 68:6-18 (Avidan).\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 9, 69:24-70:2 and 72:2-73:24 (Avidan).\n\n878.\n\nThe Tribunal is therefore unconvinced that Mr. Tour\u00e9 had the necessary qualifications in the mining sector to provide valuable assistance to a foreign mining investor. It rather appears, as the analysis below will show, that Mr. Tour\u00e9 was hired because of his family ties with President Cont\u00e9 through his half-sister Ms. Tour\u00e9, and his resulting ability to exert influence over government officials.\n\n879.\n\nIn conclusion, the record shows that all the intermediaries lacked experience and expertise in the mining industry. The Tribunal appreciates that an investor seeking to invest in a country unknown to him may also retain the services of professionals outside his industry, to assist with all kinds of administrative, logistical, legal or other matters involved in setting up operations in a new country. Yet, the persons retained would then have qualifications necessary to give assistance in the area of expertise for which they are consulted. Here, there are no indications to this effect, which is also confirmed when examining the services provided.\n\n(c) Services\n------------\n\n880.\n\nThe Tribunal will examine what services were performed by each of the payment recipients, starting with Pentler.\n\n*Pentler*\n---------\n\n881.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Pentler introduced BSGR into Guinea and was remunerated for identifying the mining opportunities and for sharing knowledge about the country and its institutions.1161 In particular, Mr. Cilins provided \"practical assistance\" such as buying cars, opening bank accounts, hiring staff and obtaining insurance.1162 More specifically, the Claimants rely on the report of their expert Mr. Ferreira to argue that a 17.65% shareholding was in line with the \"valuable role\" played by Pentler.1163 They further argue that paying Pentler USD 22 million for their shareholding and USD 8 million as an extra profit after the sale of a 51% share to Vale \"was a good deal for BSGR\".1164\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 116.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 116.\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 117-118, referring to Expert Report of Fran\u00e7ois Ferreira, 8 January 2017, para. 58.\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 120-121.\n\n882.\n\nThis being so, the Claimants provide no information on the actual services that could have justified such a high compensation. Quite to the contrary, the Claimants\u2019 witnesses sought to downplay the role of Pentler and its principals. For instance, Mr. Struik stated that he had limited use for Mr. Cilins at the beginning of 2006 and that he later sought to get rid of him: \"I was introduced to the guy, we used him initially; after that, I\u2019ve said, \"Bye-bye, because I don\u2019t need you\"\".1165 He also denied having been involved in the drafting of the Pentler/Bah/Tour\u00e9 protocol, although an initial draft of that document was found on his laptop, thus showing that Mr. Struik and Mr. Cilins were actively discussing the terms of contracts which Pentler concluded with third parties.1166\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 131:20-22 (Struik).\n\nThe Claimants' explanation that Mr. Cilins somehow manipulated Mr. Struik's laptop has already been rejected further above (see paragraph 789).\n\n883.\n\nMr. Avidan also testified that he had no idea that Mr. Cilins was part of Pentler and that he was not aware until 2007 that BSGR had signed \"any agreements with Pentler\".1167 He also said that he \"knew nothing of Pentler's dealings with third parties\" and that he only found out in 2007 through Mr. Struik that Pentler had introduced BSGR to Guinea (although Mr. Cilins stated that he only became interested in mining in Guinea after having got to know BSGR)1168 and that Pentler was a shareholder of BSGR Guinea.1169 According to Mr. Avidan, \"Pentler and Mr. Cilins played no role in BSGR's projects in Guinea from the end of 2006 onwards\" and \"certainly played no role after March 2008, when [the] share purchase agreement was signed\".1170 Concerning Mr. Cilins more specifically, Mr. Avidan said that he \"preferred not to have him around anymore\" and thus asked Mr. Cilins to leave at the end of 2006.1171\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 14.\n\nAttestation de M. Cilins, 26 novembre 2012, p. 1 (Exh.

They also contest that Pentler entered into the August 2010 contracts with Ms. Tour\u00e9 on their behalf, that Pentler's payments to Ms. Tour\u00e9 in July-August 2010 were made on their behalf, and that Pentler's payments to Olympia in March-April 2011 were made on their behalf.\n\nReply, para. 348.\n\n\"Au cours de tr\u00e8s nombreuses r\u00e9unions avec le Minist\u00e8re des mines et le Centre de promotion et de d\u00e9veloppement miniers (CPDM), j'ai donc pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 BSGR ainsi que les projets men\u00e9s \u00e0 bien par ce groupe [\u2026] Il n'a jamais \u00e9t\u00e9 question que je dissimule ma coop\u00e9ration avec BSGR\".

R-169).\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 14, 19, 29.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 14.\n\n885.\n\nIn the same vein, the Tribunal is also struck by Mr. Struik\u2019s explanation that, in spite of the obligation imposed on Pentler in the Milestone Agreement, the latter was not expected to take any \"active role\" in achieving BSGR\u2019s mining operations in Guinea:\n\n\"Q. Were they expected to take any other active role in the mining operations?\n\nA. No, because they had no mining background. They could not assist there, they could not add any value.\"1176\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 115:4-7 (Struik).\n\n886.\n\nWhen confronted with the paragraph of the Milestone Agreement providing that Pentler would continue its efforts to *inter alia* \"assist in any manner possible with the Simandou Iron Ore Project\", Mr. Struik sought to deflect the issue by arguing that this clause had been inserted by Mr. Oron.1177\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 119:15-120:4 (Struik).\n\n887.\n\nFor the Tribunal, there is a serious tension between the lack of evidence of services provided by Pentler (beyond the assistance in setting up a presence), on the one hand, and its substantial remunerations, on the other. Indeed, the Claimants fail to give a cogent explanation for providing a 17.65% shareholding to Pentler and promising millions of dollars to individuals who had no mining experience at all. The assistance in establishing presence in Conakry, a service that the Claimants acknowledge, hardly justifies such compensation. Nor is the Claimants\u2019 explanation that Pentler introduced BSGR to the opportunity of mining for iron ore in Guinea convincing. Indeed, the presence of iron ore reserves in the Simandou area was well-known since the 1960s and at the latest since Rio Tinto obtained its mining concession over Blocks 1 to 4 in 2002. An official map of 2006 shows that the existence of iron ore in Zogota was publicly known.1178 Therefore, it is hard to believe that Pentler, without any mining experience, was instrumental in proposing mining opportunities to BSGR.\n\nGeological map of Guinea, 2006 (Exh. R-164).\n\n888.\n\nIn the absence of proof of effective legitimate services beyond those just accepted, the Tribunal has no choice but to conclude that Pentler and its principals were remunerated for their contacts, and more specifically for their access to President Cont\u00e9 through Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Mr. Tour\u00e9.\n\n*Messrs. Bah and Daou*\n----------------------\n\n889.\n\nWith respect to Messrs. Bah and Daou, the Claimants argue that BSGR did not enter into contracts with these individuals and that it had no knowledge of their link to Pentler.1179 They submit that these individuals only had a relationship with Pentler and consequently deny any involvement with them. As was discussed above, Mr. Struik was aware that Pentler was dealing with Mr. Bah to favor BSGR\u2019s interests in Guinea. Indeed, a first draft of the Pentler/Bah/Tour\u00e9 agreement dated 17 January 2006 was found on his laptop. As for Mr. Daou, it is noteworthy that Mr. Bah wrote to Mr. Struik in 2010 that Mr. Oron paid Mr. Daou USD 75,000 in cash and that Mr. Struik was present on that occasion.1180\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 104 and 127.\n\n(\"Et apr\u00e8s tout cela, nous sommes retourn\u00e9s \u00e0 Novotel o\u00f9 Mr Roy a sorti 500 000 Dollars de son sac pour nous les remettre dont 75 000 Dollars pour Mr Isma\u00ebl Dao et 425 000 Dollars pour Mr Ibrahim Sory Tour\u00e9 et moi\")[REDACTED]\n\n890.\n\nHere again, the correspondence between Mr. Bah and Mr. Struik and between the former and Messrs. Lev Ran and Cilins demonstrates that Messrs. Bah and Daou were remunerated for introducing Mr. Cilins to Ms. Tour\u00e9 and her half-brother.1181\n\n(\"Mr Frederic Cillins, rappelez vous que vous \u00e9tiez venus dans mon bureau \u00e0 Bamako avec Mr Dao Ismael me voir.

Mr. Avidan also stated that Mr. Tour\u00e9 would accompany him \"say 80% of the time\" to visit ministers or President Cont\u00e9.1182 For the Claimants, there is \"nothing suspicious\" about Mr. Tour\u00e9 receiving a USD 450,000 bonus in 2010, which payment was approved by the BSGR board.1183 This bonus was given after the conclusion of the joint venture with Vale and Mr. Tour\u00e9 was not the only employee who received a bonus.1184 In addition, the amount of this bonus is only a fraction of the overall bonus pool.1185 The Claimants further argue that Mr. Tour\u00e9 was \"valuable to BSGR in his own right\", since he was kept on board after President Cont\u00e9's death.1186\n\nTr.

Tour\u00e9 and Bah received USD 425,000 from Pentler for helping to achieve the first milestone. It is further undisputed that Mr. Tour\u00e9 was employed by BSGR Guinea since 2006 and that he received a regular salary as well as a bonus of USD 450,000 in 2010.1192\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 107-108.\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 104-105.\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 107-109; C-PHB1, paras. 179-180.\n\n894.\n\nThe Claimants have not specified the type of services which Mr. Tour\u00e9 provided to Pentler for his alleged assisting in reaching the first milestone. Neither have they indicated what services Mr. Tour\u00e9 performed entitling him to a bonus of USD 450,000.\n\n895.\n\nBased on available records, the total bonuses paid by BSGR in 2010 amounted to approx. USD 12.9 million.1193 Mr. Tour\u00e9 obtained USD 450,000 in two tranches; the first of USD 250,000 was paid on 14 July 2010 and the second of USD 200,000 was paid on 10 August 2010.1194 The only persons having received larger amounts are Dag Cramer (USD 3 million), Marc Struik (USD 2 million), Asher Avidan (USD 2.5 million), Gerry Wilson (USD 800,000) and David Barrett (USD 600,000).1195 In addition to Mr. Tour\u00e9, bonuses were paid to other local employees. For instance, Issiaga Bangoura received USD 100,000, Nassirou Bah USD 15,000 and Nyanga Goumou USD 10,000.1196 Obviously, Mr. Tour\u00e9 received between USD 350,000 and USD 440,000 more than these other local employees. These differences are all the more striking as the Claimants have given no information on the services which Mr. Tour\u00e9 rendered to earn such a bonus. Moreover, BSGR did not disclose Mr. Tour\u00e9's bonus to the Technical Committee. When asked in October 2012, whether he was offered gifts or benefits,1197 BSGR told the committee that \"all [Mr. Tour\u00e9] received in exchange for his work was his normal salary, and he was never offered any gifts\",1198 despite the fact that BSGR distinguished between salaries, bonuses and payments for consulting services in accordance with normal accounting practices, as the excel files on record evince. Mr. Avidan's attempt at the Merits Hearing to justify the answer given to the Technical Committee by saying that he considered a \"remuneration\" to include both the salary and the bonus is therefore unconvincing.1199\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nLetter from BSGR to the Technical Committee, 26 December 2012, pp. 6-7 (Exh.

The reply to allegation 5 says: \"\u2026 all he received in exchange for his work was his normal salary\u2026\" And a moment ago you said the $450,000 was a bonus and was not a salary. Or did I misunderstand you? So now I'm confused, frankly. A. When I say the \"r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration\", or his salary, like all of us, we all considered the bonus part like it is one of the r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, as a salary. A bonus is a bonus, as it sounds and as it is\") Tr. (Merits), Day 9, 80:9-19 (Avidan).\n\n896.\n\nTo conclude, while the Tribunal is mindful that Mr. Tour\u00e9 was an employee of BSGR Guinea, it finds that the Claimants failed to show what legitimate services he rendered to receive a bonus of USD 450,000 in addition to his salary. Similarly, they did not make clear what services he rendered to receive (with Mr. Bah) the first milestone payment of USD 425,000.\n\n*Ms. Tour\u00e9*\n-----------\n\n897.\n\nSimilarly, there is no information on record about any legitimate services performed by Ms. Tour\u00e9, which tends to show that she was compensated for providing direct access to her husband, President Cont\u00e9.\n\n*Mr. Thiam*\n-----------\n\n898.\n\nEqually, evidence is lacking in respect of services provided by Minister Thiam to BSGR. The Claimants\u2019 argument that it is standard practice to pay travel expenses of government officials in certain circumstances is surprising to say the least and unsubstantiated. Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s statement that Mr. Thiam replaced Guinea\u2019s President, who had been invited \"out of courtesy\" to his daughter\u2019s wedding but could not attend,1200 is equally unavailing. Mr. Steinmetz further testified that Mr. Thiam was \"scrupulous in ensuring that flights and hospitality [...] were only accepted in appropriate circumstances\".1201 Yet, the Claimants have not clarified why these circumstances were appropriate. Nor have they given any legitimate ground for this payment. To the Tribunal, there is nothing appropriate about a private company paying travel expenses of a government official to attend a private wedding.\n\nSteinmetz (CWS-8), para. 31.\n\nSteinmetz (CWS-8), para. 31.\n\n(d) Due diligence\n-----------------\n\n899.\n\nIt is generally accepted that, when investing in a country, an investor must exercise reasonable due diligence, including with respect to the use of third parties in transactions with the government.1202 The level of diligence required depends on the circumstances of each investment, which includes the general business environment.1203 This is particularly so of investments in a country or sector with a high degree of endemic corruption.1204 It follows that investors must be more diligent in a corrupt environment, including with respect to third parties,1205 and especially if the third party has personal, family or business relationships with public officials or relatives of public officials.1206 In an environment riddled with corruption, it is also generally accepted that common accounting practices must be faithfully adhered to.\n\n*Alasdair Ross Anderson et al. v.

There is no evidence either that they exerted any diligence in respect to Messrs. Bah and Daou. Finally, it appears that the Claimants did not adhere to generally accepted accounting practices.\n\nCM, paras. 6, 853; Reply, Annex I, para. 114.\n\nCM, para. 853, referring to Transparency International, Corruption Perceptions Index 2006 (Exh.

Mr. Oron negotiated the terms of the Milestone Agreement and Mr. Struik was \"clear and consistent\" that he was not there to check, disbelieve, or verify Mr. Oron's connections.1210\n\nR-PHB1, para. 80.\n\nC-PHB2, para. 21.\n\n902.\n\nMr. Struik confirmed at the hearing that the Milestone Agreement was informally negotiated between Messrs. Oron and Noy,1211 and that there was no written record of the contractual history.1212 He also testified that he was not involved in the negotiation.1213 He added that Mr. Oron gave him instructions about the content of the agreement which he followed and that Pentler's minority shareholding \"was not something [he] concerned [himself] with\":1214\n\n\"Q. But as a director of the company, did you feel you needed to understand who these people were who were going to actually own a significant minority interest?\n\nA. These people [i.e. the Pentler officials] introduced the project in Guinea to us. They came through the connections that Mr Oron had with Mr Noy. I was not there to check that or disbelieve that or verify that. He was my boss; these were his connections. This is what you do. I followed an instruction.\"1215\n\n(\"[T]he arrangement between Pentler and BSGR was negotiated by Mr Oron, I had no part in it.

So in your knowledge, is there such a previous document? A. [\u2026] No, I cannot recollect any previous document.

(Merits), Day 4, 118:1-9 (Struik).\n\n903.\n\nMr. Struik also conceded that he did not engage in any due diligence about Pentler or its principals before signing the Milestone Agreement:\n\n\"Q. Before signing this letter, did you conduct any due diligence on who Cilins, Noy and Lev Ran were?\n\nA. No, not really.\"1216\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 4, 117:3-5 (Struik).\n\n904.\n\nOn this basis, it is clear that the Claimants did not apply any sort of diligence, let alone meaningful due diligence, with respect to Pentler or its principals.\n\n*Ms. Tour\u00e9*\n-----------\n\n905.\n\nThe situation is the same in respect of Ms. Tour\u00e9, even though there were contemporaneous indications, such as press articles, that she was the President\u2019s wife.1217 Mr. Steinmetz himself admitted that he was aware that Ms. Tour\u00e9 at the very least pretended to be President Cont\u00e9\u2019s wife: \"She was not also - as far as I was told; I haven\u2019t checked it myself, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to debate about it - I mean, as far as I was told, she was never the fourth wife of President Cont\u00e9, but she pretended to be\".1218 Similarly, Mr. Struik heard that she had the President\u2019s ear.1219 Being on notice that this was \"what people said\", whether they believed it or not, the Claimants should have inquired further rather than conveniently putting their heads in the sand.\n\nEnregistrement vid\u00e9o de la r\u00e9ception de BSGR \u00e0 Conakry https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOfNE2gZH1o, 19 septembre 2007 (Exh.

The fact that it did not do so strongly suggests that it was perfectly aware of her role and turned to her for this very reason. The deferential manner in which Ms. Tour\u00e9 was welcomed at BSGR's September 2006 reception in Conakry is just an additional corroborating factor.1224\n\n(\"Shortly after my arrival in Conakry Mr Tour\u00e9, who was Ms Tour\u00e9's half-brother, told me about her and said that I should go and see her. He said that she was an influential lady and BSGR should keep on the right side of her.

Struik and Avidan, (ii) the verification of the \"legitimacy\" of the payment request by Mr. Tchelet to ensure that there was a \"valid explanation\" and \"documentation\" and that the payment was within budget,1226 (iii) the authorization by Mr. Oron, or later Mr. Struik, and (iv) the execution of the payment.1227 According to Mr. Tchelet, this process provided him \"with the reassurance [he] required in [his] role as CFO, that the payments [he] was asked to authorise had been sufficiently analysed and reviewed and all information obtained, to confirm they were valid\".1228 He also specified that, except in \"isolated cases\", BSGR's policy was \"to obtain and provide all supporting documentation to Head Office before requesting payment\".1229 Thus, \"for nearly every single payment made to a person acting for BSGR, there must be both an invoice and a corresponding contract\".1230\n\nTr.

For instance, he approved two payments to Mr. Fofana in the amount of USD 100,000 and EUR 80,000 having no contract available at the time of approval or at any later time (although he requested it).1232 Mr. Avidan's mention that the payment was \"approved by B.\" was apparently sufficient for Mr. Tchelet to execute it, although he had no idea of the \"special consulting\" provided by Mr. Fofana.1233\n\n(\"Q. [\u2026] Before payment could be made within BSGR, you would look to see an invoice and a contract; is that correct? A. That is correct. That was what we really strove to do. I can say that \u2013 Q. I think you've answered the question, thank you. A. \u2013 it wasn't always fulfilled, because in certain cases we were not able to get both sets of documentation\") Tr. (Merits), Day 3, 137:22-138:3 (Tchelet).\n\n(\"Q. [\u2026] BSGR made two payments to Mr Fofana in the amount of $100,000 and in the amount of \u20ac 80,000. Was there an agreement between BSGR and Mr Fofana? A. I was not aware of such agreement. I did request on several occasions\") Tr. (Merits), Day 3, 159:12-16 (Tchelet).\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 3, 159:24-160:19 (Tchelet).\n\n912.\n\nSimilary, Mr. Tchelet confirmed that there was no agreement between BSGR and Mr. Sidibe1234 and could not recall whether the contract between BSGR and LMS mentioned Mr. Sidibe,1235 although Mr. Sidibe received a series of payments as discussed above (see paragraph 836). He also said that he had seen a contract between BSGR and Mr. Boutros, but that contract was not produced.\n\n(\"Q. Were there any agreements between Mr Sidibe and BSGR? A. No, there were not\") Tr. (Merits), Day 3, 163:18-19 (Tchelet).\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 3, 163:20-24 (Tchelet).\n\n913.\n\nThereafter, Mr. Tchelet conceded that he followed instructions of Mr. Avidan to pay Messrs. Boutros and Sidibe without having any invoices.1236 For instance, he sent an email on 14 February 2010 to his staff saying that \"BSGR Guinea needs to make payment tomorrow morning amounting to USD 1,000,000 (One Million United States Dollars) as consulting fees in respect of Ghassan Boutros\".1237 He further added \"[p]lease note that payment is extremely urgent\".1238 Mr. Tchelet's explanation is essentially that, if Mr. Avidan who knew of the payment process requirements gave him the instructions to pay without complying with the requirements, he would follow them,1239 which shows that the checks and balances in place could easily be disregarded. This lack of compliance with accounting standards was not an isolated occurrence. The record shows numerous instances where payments were made urgently, without supporting documentation.1240\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 3, 165:2-17 (Tchelet).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n(\"Q. So the country manager instructed you to make the payment; and regardless of whether or not an invoice exists, you make that payment? A. His instruction was the approval, and with the understanding, knowing \u2013 he knew our set of rules and the blueprint \u2013 that we must have an invoice. But the circumstances of the project and his requirements were such that the payment was urgent. And if the instructed us that the payment was urgent, our role was to support the project, which had thousands of payments to keep to a rigid timetable\") Tr. (Merits), Day 3, 176:19-177:4 (Tchelet).\n\n(\"payment is extremely urgent\") [REDACTED] (\"'send 300k to Ghassan now to the same banking details in Belgium please' \u2013 from yossie skype \u2013 very urgent\") [REDACTED] (\"Invoice to follow\") [REDACTED] (\"Ghassan-invoice to follow in due course\") [REDACTED] (\"we need to make payment today to Ghassan\") [REDACTED] (Email subject line \"Payment today\" with instruction to \"please load payment amount to USD212K today to Ghassan \u2013 invoice is pending\") [REDACTED] (\"invoice pending\" for a payment of USD 325,000 to Ghassan) Instruction de paiement de BSGR TS \u00e0 LMS pour 325.000 USD, 12 avril 2010 (Exh. 291); (\"we need to pay usd200k today to lms/ghassan\") [REDACTED]\n\n914.\n\nAnother illustration of non-compliant practices is found in the discrepancies between the characterization of services or goods in the accounts and the related invoice. This is particularly the case of Mr. Boutros, whose invoices referred to the delivery of machinery but whose services were systematically classified as consulting services.1241\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n915.\n\nStill another unorthodox accounting practice was the concealment on certain names in the accounts. For instance, Mr. Tchelet wrote to his team on 26 April 2009:\n\n\"What is sensitive is the names in respect of consulting fees paid-please always check with me first before sending reports which include those details to [...] anyone inside Guinea.\n\nAlso under no circumstances should any details relating to payments to Pentler, past or pending or future be sent to anyone inside Guinea without speaking with me first.\"1242\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n916.\n\nThe next day, Ms. Nicolle sought clarification: \"I'm not sure who you mean by consultants as all Guinea salaries are now consulting fees\"1243 to which Mr. Tchelet answered:\n\n\"I am referring to cases where BSGR TS pays on behalf of newco consulting fees to for eg Ghassan [Boutros] or others - those are the type of consulting fees that you should check with me first before sending the details automatically to Guinea local.\"1244\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n917.\n\nSimilarly, on 21 April 2009, Mr. Tchelet instructed Ms. Nicolle as follows:\n\n\"Please remove the USD 3m and 1m purchase fees paid to Pentler from this report ASAP. It should not be included in the Guinea costs report.\"1245\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n918.\n\nThat instruction was printed out, someone adding by hand:\n\n\"Remove Ghassan Boutros' name from Guinea spreadsheet.\"1246\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n919.\n\nIn summary, the record shows that the Claimants did not perform any meaningful due diligence in respect of intermediaries, and failed to comply with their own accounting standards.\n\n(e) Witness tampering and destruction of evidence\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n920.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that BSGR sought to buy Ms. Tour\u00e9's silence and to destroy evidence. The Claimants dispute such attempts and submit that they were the victims of blackmail attempts by Ms. Tour\u00e9,1247 Mr. Bah, and Mr. Hennig.1248 The record does not bear out these allegations. While there is evidence of BSGR complaining, there is no indication of blackmailing by these individuals. The Claimants did not file criminal complaints and did not notify the police, notwithstanding legal advice to the contrary.1249 In addition, the Claimants\u2019 blackmail allegation rests on the erroneous assumption that they were presented with forged documents, which was disproven in these proceedings.\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 149; Struik (CWS-2), para. 110; C-PHB1, paras. 269(ii), 274(ii), 281.\n\nSee, for instance: Avidan (CWS-3), paras. 95-100, 151; Struik (CWS-2), para. 22; Reply, Annex I, para. 14; Tr.

I said \u2013 no, I said I don't want to go. Skadden really insisted\") Tr. (Merits), Day 9, 130:15-131:11 (Avidan).\n\n921.\n\nQuite to the contrary, the record shows that the Claimants sought to buy Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s silence by making her sign confidentiality clauses, and inducing her to make false statements and to destroy evidence. For instance, the contract of 3 August 2010, which purported to put an end to the collaboration between Pentler and Ms. Tour\u00e9, contained an \"irrevocable\" undertaking to ensure \"absolute\" confidentiality:\n\n\"Les deux soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Pentler Holdings Ltd. et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Matinda & Co. Ltd, Mme Mamadie Tour\u00e9, ses partenaires et conseillers s\u2019engagent irr\u00e9vocablement \u00e0 assurer la confidentialit\u00e9 absolue sur toutes nos affaires communes men\u00e9es en Guin\u00e9e et \u00e0 ne pas d\u00e9voiler directement ou indirectement une affaire ou des affaires communes.\"1250\n\nAccord entre Pentler et Matinda, 3 ao\u00fbt 2010, clause 4 (Exh. R-346) (Emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n922.\n\nThis contract also prohibited Matinda and Ms. Tour\u00e9 from disclosing contracts with third parties (such as BSGR) and from contacting any third party with which Pentler had worked in Guinea:\n\n\"La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Matinda & Co. Ltd, Mme Mamadie Tour\u00e9, ses partenaires et conseillers s\u2019engagent \u00e0 ne pas publier directement ou indirectement des contrats sign\u00e9s avec une partie tierce, \u00e0 respecter l\u2019enti\u00e8re responsabilit\u00e9 de nos activit\u00e9s en Guin\u00e9e et de ne pas faire l\u2019usage directement ou indirectement d\u2019aucun document, contrat ou accord sign\u00e9 ou pas sign\u00e9, \u00e9crit ou verbal.\n\nLa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Matinda & Co Ltd s\u2019engage par la pr\u00e9sente \u00e0 ne pas prendre contact directement ou indirectement, verbalement ou par \u00e9crit, avec aucunes [sic] des soci\u00e9t\u00e9s en Guin\u00e9e avec lesquelles nous avons eu des collaborations, des contrats, des accords verbaux ou \u00e9crits; de ne pas utiliser directement ou indirectement la voix [sic] de justice sans avoir l\u2019accord pr\u00e9alable \u00e9crit de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pentler et ses associ\u00e9s.\"1251\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n923.\n\nWhile prohibitions of the sort and confidentiality undertakings may be perfectly legitimate depending on the circumstances of a given contract, in the present context they tend to support a finding of corruption. That finding is significantly reinforced if one considers the Claimants\u2019 efforts to bring Ms. Tour\u00e9 to make false statements and destroy evidence and Mr. Cilins\u2019s trips to Jacksonville, Florida, to meet Ms. Tour\u00e9.\n\n924.\n\nMr. Cilins had various telephone conversations1252 and meetings with Ms. Tour\u00e9 in March and April 2013.1253 At that time, Ms. Tour\u00e9 was a cooperating witness for the FBI, with the consequence that the conversations and meetings were recorded. The audio and video recordings and the transcript of these conversations are part of the record.1254\n\nMr. Cilins and Ms. Tour\u00e9 had telephone conversations on 15, 16 and 20 March 2013 and on 10 April 2013.

He started out by saying that all their troubles were due to the \"imbecile\" Alpha, who \"pissed off\" everyone. By that, he meant Alpha Cond\u00e9, the new President of Guinea, who had ordered a review of BSGR's mining rights. He added that it was a horror story, but that they had no choice.1260 Ms. Tour\u00e9 said that she was frightened that they would punish her and Mr. Cilins could not help her if \"BSGR\" was not approving it. This prompted Mr. Cilins to answer that they would do as previously said; she would receive USD 300,000 immediately and more when it was all over.1261 He added that he would have to come back so that they could destroy \"the documents\" and that she would then receive the first payment:\n\n\"FC: Je reviens.

He was upset and told her to contact him as soon as she got the originals:\n\n\"FC: Les photocopies on s\u2019en fout, moi j\u2019ai pas besoin des photocopies.

It appears that these were photocopies of documents signed by Mr. Noy in Freetown,1286 a declaration signed by Ms. Tour\u00e9,1287 and a set of documents dated \"27 and 28 February\",1288 which the Tribunal understands to be the two contracts signed by Mr. Avidan and Ms. Tour\u00e9 in relation to Blocks 1 & 2.1289 Mr. Cilins then said that he would destroy these documents, asked whether Ms. Tour\u00e9 had additional documents, which she confirmed, and enquired when she would give him the originals, which they agreed would happen at their next meeting.1290\n\nTranscription \u00e9crite, par constat d'huissier, de l'enregistrement audio de conversations entre M.

Moreover, the two documents signed in Freetown mentioned in the previous paragraph make express reference to a \"contract of collaboration\" signed in 2005, thus showing that Pentler and Ms. Tour\u00e9 were already cooperating before February 2006.1293 For these reasons, it is reasonable to understand that the 20 February 2006 contract formed part of the universe of documents that Mr. Cilins wanted to destroy.\n\nProtocole Pentler /Mme Tour\u00e9 de 2006, 20 f\u00e9vrier 2006 (Exh.

Mr. Cilins again asked about the FBI investigators who had approached Ms. Tour\u00e9 and wanted to get confirmation that she had told them she had no documents. He insisted that she leave the United States and keep no copies. He said that she could not deny her involvement with BSGR if copies were found with her name, and once more reiterated the need to destroy all documentation.1294 Shortly thereafter, Mr. Cilins was arrested and taken into custody. He was thereafter convicted for obstructing a federal criminal investigation.1295\n\n(\"FC: [\u2026] C'est pour \u00e7a que je te dis, c'est bien de partir.

Cilins et, notamment, Mme Tour\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par le Federal Bureau of Investigation aux Etats-Unis, 29 novembre 2013, p. 111 (Exh. R-36). See also: Reply, Annex I, para. 11.\n\n941.\n\nThe description of these encounters shows that Mr. Cilins attempted to induce Ms. Tour\u00e9 to make false statements and promised her money in exchange for the destruction of the documents implicating BSGR and Pentler in the corruption allegations concerning BSGR\u2019s mining rights. In particular, it evidences that Mr. Cilins was seeking to destroy the 27 and 28 February 2008 contracts concluded by Mr. Avidan and Ms. Tour\u00e9.\n\n942.\n\nImportantly, the facts also make clear that Mr. Cilins acted on behalf of Mr. Steinmetz, who insisted that Mr. Cilins be present when the original documents would be destroyed. Moreover, it shows that Ms. Tour\u00e9 had previously been promised USD 5 million to remunerate her influence that were still outstanding, and that she would receive another USD 1 million for destroying the documents and signing the false declaration.\n\n943.\n\nThe Claimants argue that Mr. Cilins\u2019 actions do not implicate BSGR.1296 Mr. Steinmetz stated that Mr. Cilins did not travel to Florida on his or BSGR\u2019s behalf and that he had no authority to represent BSGR.1297 He also said that Mr. Cilins was boasting when referring to \"Beny\" as the person behind his actions and that it was common for people to speak as if they had his authority, when in reality they did not.1298 In fact, the Claimants concede that BSGR knew in advance that Mr. Cilins was going to meet Ms. Tour\u00e9 to have her sign a declaration. However, they assert that BSGR did not know that Mr. Cilins would offer her money or would ask her to destroy documents.1299 They simply wanted Ms. Tour\u00e9 to withdraw her allegations against BSGR, so they say, and the declaration she was being asked to make \"was true\".1300\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 11-18.\n\nSteinmetz (CWS-1), para. 47.\n\nSteinmetz (CWS-1), para. 48.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 13.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 12.\n\n944.\n\nThese arguments ring hollow. The affirmations that Ms. Tour\u00e9 never \"signed a contract with BSGR, either directly or indirectly\", or intervened with government officials on BSGR's behalf, or \"received money from BSGR, either directly or indirectly\", or that BSGR never \"promised to pay her anything\",1301 have already been shown not to reflect reality. Yet, at the time of Mr. Cilins' trips to Florida, BSGR had every incentive to have her make a false declaration and, in fact, Mr. Steinmetz reviewed a preliminary draft of such declaration.1302 In the Tribunal's opinion, taking into account the entirety of the record, it is simply not credible that Mr. Cilins promised to pay Ms. Tour\u00e9 USD 1 million on his own initiative without BSGR's knowledge and approval. In the overall context, it is equally implausible that Mr. Cilins made up Mr. Steinmetz's involvement to impress Ms. Tour\u00e9.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 12.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n945.\n\nMoreover, the Claimants' objection that it made no sense to destroy documents, since copies were already in circulation, does not withstand scrutiny. Indeed, the unavailability of the originals of the Disputed Documents would render it more difficult to prove their authenticity. In reality, it is thanks to those originals that the Tribunal could finally shed light on the genuineness of these documents. In this context, it is telling that the Claimants took no steps to prove their allegations of forgery. Evidently, they had no interest to do so.\n\n(f) Influence of Ms. and Mr. Tour\u00e9 and acts of bribery\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n946.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by recalling that it is sufficient for the purposes of subparagraph (c) of Article 6.1 of the ECOWAS Protocol to show an attempt of active influence peddling. Accordingly, it is not necessary to show that actual influence over public officials has been exerted or that the desired result has been achieved. For the avoidance of doubt, however, the analysis below clearly shows that Ms. Tour\u00e9 and her half-brother actively sought to influence the decision-making process leading to the issuance of the exploration permits for North and South Simandou. The analysis further shows that the Claimants made payments to Minister Thiam and the members of the Technical Commission to secure the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession.\n\n947.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address the exploration permits for North and South Simandou and then turn to the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession.\n\n*North and South Simandou exploration permits*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n948.\n\nFor the following reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants obtained their exploration permits for North and South Simandou because of the influence which Ms. Tour\u00e9 and her half-brother exerted on President Cont\u00e9 and Minister Souar\u00e9.\n\n949.\n\nThe record shows that BSGR obtained access to President Cont\u00e9 through Ms. Tour\u00e9, who was President Cont\u00e9's wife, and that the Claimants were aware of this relationship in 2005 and 2006. Minister Souar\u00e9 testified that BSGR had access to the President through Ms. Tour\u00e9: \"tout cela est arriv\u00e9 parce que BSGR a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidence. Et BSGR a acc\u00e9d\u00e9 \u00e0 la pr\u00e9sidence gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 Mamadie Tour\u00e9\".1303 He also stated that the first meeting between the President, BSGR, and himself was organized by Ms. Tour\u00e9: \"Et le premier entretien entre le pr\u00e9sident, BSGR et moi a \u00e9t\u00e9 suscit\u00e9 et organis\u00e9 par Mamadie Tour\u00e9. Donc, quand je vois Mamadie Tour\u00e9 quelque part dans ce dossier, c'est que c'est l'onction du pr\u00e9sident\".1304\n\nTr. (Merits) (FR), Day 6, 16:34-35.\n\nTr. (Merits) (FR), Day 6, 15:39-42.\n\n950.\n\nMinister Sylla wrote in his witness statement and confirmed at the hearing that it was common knowledge that Ms. Tour\u00e9 exerted influence on behalf of BSGR: \"Il \u00e9tait connu que Mamadie Tour\u00e9 usait de son influence pour certaines soci\u00e9t\u00e9s et notamment que BSGR avait ses entr\u00e9es au palais gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 elle\".1305 He added having heard from officials at the Presidency that Ms. Tour\u00e9 had exerted pressure on his predecessor, Minister Souar\u00e9, so that BSGR would get its exploration permits.1306 While this evidence is hearsay and thus does not carry much weight on its own, Minister Sylla also observed that Mr. Tour\u00e9 had told him that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was using her influence so that BSGR could get access to President Cont\u00e9.1307\n\nSylla (RWS-1), para. 15; Tr. (Merits) (FR), Day 7, 16:32-40. See also: R-PHB1, para. 233.\n\n(\"J'ai aussi appris qu'elle [i.e. Mme Tour\u00e9] avait exerc\u00e9 des pressions sur mon pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur, Ahmed Tidiane Souar\u00e9, pour qu'il attribue des droits \u00e0 BSGR\") Sylla (RWS-1), para. 15.\n\nSylla (RWS-1), para. 15.\n\n951.\n\nIn fact, Ms. Tour\u00e9 was present during the first meeting with President Cont\u00e9 on 2 December 2005. And when President Cont\u00e9 authorized BSGR to use his helicopter to survey the Simandou mountain, which is undisputed,1308 and an incident occurred, Ms. Tour\u00e9 attended the meeting with Minister Souar\u00e9 to discuss that incident. [REDACTED]1309\n\nThe mission report mentions an \"urgent\" survey mission recommended by President Cont\u00e9 in the following terms: \"Dans le cadre g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'\u00e9valuation des ressources mini\u00e8res en Fer du site des Monts Simandou et ses environs directs, une Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9nomm\u00e9e BSGR Ressources [sic] s'est adress\u00e9e aux Autorit\u00e9s Guin\u00e9ene [sic] pour une expertise rapide et syst\u00e9matique des richesses qe rec\u00e8lerait ledit site.

Instead of first going through the CPDM, on 2 December 2005, BSGR and Mr. Cilins met with President Cont\u00e9, a meeting that Ms. Tour\u00e9 says she had organized.1311 Minister Souar\u00e9 explained that he was called to the meeting and that President Cont\u00e9 told him to facilitate matters for BSBR: \"Le Pr\u00e9sident a simplement dit qu\u2019il fallait leur faciliter la t\u00e2che pour investir dans le pays. Du fait de la pr\u00e9sence de Mamadie Tour\u00e9 \u00e0 cette r\u00e9union, j\u2019ai compris que BSGR avait tap\u00e9 \u00e0 sa porte et qu\u2019elle avait demand\u00e9 au Pr\u00e9sident de les aider\".1312 At the hearing, he added that he understood the President to instruct him to assist BSGR: \"But when you\u2019re receiving a company as a matter of courtesy, and as a minister you are then summoned by the presidency to receive directives, it means that the visit was a courtesy visit, but that there was a presidential position taken that has to be complied with on this given matter\".1313\n\nMs. Tour\u00e9 stated the following: \"Le Pr\u00e9sident et Cilins se sont rencontr\u00e9s pour la premi\u00e8re fois dans un palais pr\u00e9sidentiel \u00e0 Conakry. J'ai parl\u00e9 avec le Pr\u00e9sident pour qu'il accepte la r\u00e9union, et j'ai parl\u00e9 avec la garde pr\u00e9sidentielle afin que Cilins et d'autres puissent entrer dans le bureau. J'ai personnellement pr\u00e9sent\u00e9 Cilins au Pr\u00e9sident, et j'ai expliqu\u00e9 que Cilins repr\u00e9sentait BSGR et que BSGR voulait exploiter des mines en Guin\u00e9e\".

C-6).\n\n956.\n\nIn addition, Ms. Tour\u00e9 testified that she accelerated the issuance of the exploration permits. According to her, Mr. Cilins complained that the issuance of the permits took longer than expected and she therefore intervened with Minister Souar\u00e9: \"Apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9union, BSGR a d\u00e9pos\u00e9 une demande de permis, mais des titres miniers n\u2019ont pas \u00e9t\u00e9 accord\u00e9s imm\u00e9diatement. Cilins m\u2019a demand\u00e9 de d\u00e9couvrir pourquoi les permis de BSGR avaient \u00e9t\u00e9 retard\u00e9s. J\u2019ai appel\u00e9 Souar\u00e9 pour en parler, et BSGR a obtenu deux blocs d\u2019exploitation peu apr\u00e8s, et je savais qu\u2019il s\u2019agissait des blocs \u00ab Simandou Nord et Sud \u00bb\".1316\n\nD\u00e9claration de Mme Tour\u00e9, 2 d\u00e9cembre 2013, para. 12 (Exh. R-35).\n\n957.\n\nAs a result, on 6 February 2006, two months after BSGR\u2019s initial encounter with President Cont\u00e9, the North and South Simandou exploration permits were issued to BSGR, a company with no prior experience in iron mining and no proven track record of financial and technical capabilities. This is all the more so remarkable as, according to the Claimants, several major companies had applied for the same mining areas.\n\n958.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that Minister Souar\u00e9 testified that the issuance of the exploration permits was done in accordance with applicable procedures.1317 The Tribunal is also mindful of the fact that Minister Souar\u00e9 testified that he did not receive direct instructions by President Cont\u00e9 to grant the exploration permits to BSGR.1318 It may very well be that the CPDM followed the applicable procedures. This does not detract from the fact that Minister Souar\u00e9 stated that he felt pressured by President Cont\u00e9, Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Mr. Tour\u00e9 to facilitate matters for BSGR.1319 Indeed, Minister Souar\u00e9 stated that he instructed the CPDM to \"find non-occupied zones\" for BSGR as a means to \"escape presidential pressure\".1320 It is further noteworthy that he added that a minister should normally not instruct the CPDM to issue mining permits:\n\n\"Q. It is in keeping with the law that you should give these directives to CPDM?\n\nA. Look here, sir. When you\u2019re under presidential instructions, you try and apply those instructions in full compliance with the law.

(Merits) (FR), Day 6, 77:12-15 (Souar\u00e9).\n\n960.\n\nIn sum, the Tribunal is satisfied that Ms. Tour\u00e9 sought to influence President Cont\u00e9 to grant the North and South Simandou exploration permits to BSGR, and that the Claimants obtained these permits because of this influence.\n\n*Base Convention and Zogota Mining Concession*\n----------------------------------------------\n\n961.\n\nHaving come to the conclusion that the North and South Simandou exploration permits were obtained through corrupt practices, the Tribunal could dispense with assessing whether the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession were also acquired by way of illegal means. Indeed, the fact that the exploration permits were obtained through active influence peddling equally taints the signature of the Base Convention and the award of the Zogota Mining Concession. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal will nevertheless assess the circumstances surrounding the award of the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession.\n\n962.\n\nThe following elements support the Respondent\u2019s case that the Claimants made payments to Mr. Thiam and the Technical Commission for which the record contains no legitimate explanations and that they secured the signature of the Base Convention and the grant of the Zogota Mining Concession through corrupt practices.\n\n963.\n\nFirst, the Respondent\u2019s allegation that a \"great proximity\" existed between BSGR and Minister Thiam is exemplified by the fact that BSGR reimbursed Mr. Thiam\u2019s travel costs for USD 24,444.26,1324 including in particular a trip to the wedding of Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s daughter, for which the Claimants provided no cogent explanation and which the Tribunal finds suspicious.1325 The proximity between Mr. Steinmetz and Minister Thiam is also clear from the informal tone used in their email exchanges.1326 Importantly, Minister Thiam regularly provided BSGR informal updates containing confidential information on other mining companies such as Rio Tinto.1327 Moreover, Mr. Thiam went out of his way to make public statements in support of BSGR and was involved in the search for potential partners for BSGR.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nThiam (CWS-5), paras. 89.5 and 123. See also: Steinmetz (CWS-8), para. 31.\n\nCourriel du Ministre Thiam \u00e0 M. Steinmetz, 24 mai 2009 (Exh. R-256); Courriel du Ministre Thiam \u00e0 M. Steinmetz, 25 mai 2009 (Exh. R-257); Courriel de M. Steinmetz au Ministre Thiam, 26 mai 2009 (Exh, R-258). For instance, on 26 May 2009, Minister Thiam wrote to Mr. Steinmetz from his BlackBerry: \"Pres wants to send me to see lybians father or son to clarify. Wants to call father tom to tell him kouyate does not talk for guinea and will never be pres in guinea\". Mr. Steinmetz responded on the same day as follows: \"Have y given the Letter from PM? Good?\", to which Minister Thiam responded later: \"Yes. Very good\" Courriel de M. Steinmetz au Ministre Thiam, 26 mai 2009 (Exh. R-258). Mr. Thiam also asked Mr. Steinmetz to send him photos \"of the two houses he [i.e. Mr. Thiam] likes here in Mykonos\" [REDACTED]\n\nFor instance, on 29 April 2010, Mr. Thiam forwarded to Mr. Steinmetz a letter from the Ministry of Mines to Rio Tinto. [REDACTED] He also sent an email on 26 June 2010 with the subject line \"confidential\" attaching another [REDACTED] On 14 September 2010, he transmitted to Mr. Avidan a letter from Guinea's Prime Minister to Rio Tinto. [REDACTED]\n\n964.\n\nThe Respondent also pointed to WikiLeaks cables from the US Embassy mentioning that Mr. Thiam \"has personally benefited from CIF and BSGR, as evidenced by his recent purchase of a $3 million property in New York\".1328 The record indeed shows that, on 20 October 2009, Mr. Thiam bought a house in New York for approx. USD 1.5 million.1329 However, there is no evidence that the funds used for this purchase came from BSGR. The WikiLeaks cable just quoted is insufficient to establish such a connection.\n\nWikileaks, C\u00e2ble diplomatique de l'Ambassade des Etats-Unis en Guin\u00e9e, Mining companies concerned about governement appointments, 25 f\u00e9vrier 2010 (Exh.

See also: [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n965.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal notes the haste with which Mr. Thiam set up the Technical Commission leading to the signature of the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession. That Commission reached its conclusion in a surprisingly short time. On 16 November 2009, BSGR requested a mining concession for Sud Simandou (i.e. Zogota) and submitted a feasibility study.1330 On 1 December 2009, Minister Thiam established the Technical Commission, which started its work on 4 December 2009, one day after an assassination attempt on President Dadis Camara. The report of the Technical Commission found that the feasibility study was incomplete, as it only mentioned resources, and did not specify reserves as required.1331 Similarly, the environmental impact study was rudimentary and there was no assessment of communal development.1332 In other words, the exploration phase was not completed and the committee\u2019s report recorded that \"[l]es donn\u00e9es dans l\u2019\u00e9tude seront affin\u00e9es par les travaux de prospection qui se poursuivent pour avoir exactement les r\u00e9serves\".1333 Notwithstanding these flaws, on 14 December 2009, the committee issued a report in favor of awarding a mining concession.1334 This was merely ten days after the start of its work and two weeks after its constitution and in a period when an attempted coup had destabilized the country.\n\nLettre de M.

R-268).\n\n966.\n\nFinally, as was already discussed, BSGR paid USD 1,000 to each member of the Technical Commission, which represents five times their monthly salary. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt Mr. Souar\u00e9\u2019s testimony that such payments were not common practice nor legal.\n\n967.\n\nIn the light of all these facts, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the Claimants engaged in corrupt practices in order to obtain the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession.\n\n(g) Conclusion\n--------------\n\n968.\n\nThe record contains overwhelming evidence that the Claimants employed corrupt practices to obtain the North and South Simandou exploration permits, the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession.\n\n969.\n\nThe Claimants retained the assistance of Ms. Tour\u00e9, knowing that she was President Cont\u00e9's wife and that she was in a position to exercise influence over him. They also knew that Mr. Tour\u00e9 is her half-brother and hired him as an employee to facilitate access to government officials.\n\n970.\n\nThe Claimants used Pentler as a conduit to conclude contracts of corruption with third parties and remunerate Ms. Tour\u00e9 or other intermediaries. The contracts concluded by Pentler in 2006 with Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Messrs. Bah, Tour\u00e9 and Daou are authentic and there is evidence that Mr. Struik was directly involved in the drafting of Pentler's contract with Messrs. Bah and Tour\u00e9. It is particularly striking that the success fees in the milestone agreement between BSGR and Pentler match the amounts provided in Pentler's contracts with Messrs. Daou, Bah and Tour\u00e9.1335 Between 2010 and 2012, Pentler was also used to funnel at least USD 2,236,391.02 to Ms. Tour\u00e9, although there is documentation that Ms. Tour\u00e9 actually received USD 5,419,200 in that same period. In addition, there is evidence that Mr. Steinmetz sent Mr. Cilins to Florida in the spring of 2013 to induce Ms. Tour\u00e9 to make false statements and destroy evidence.1336\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nTranscription \u00e9crite, par constat d'huissier, de l'enregistrement audio de conversations entre M. Cilins et, notamment, Mme Tour\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9 par le Federal Bureau of Investigation aux Etats-Unis, 29 novembre 2013 (Exh. R-36); [REDACTED] See paragraphs 941-944 above.\n\n971.\n\nThe Pentler principals had no relevant experience in the mining sector and were paid large sums for undisclosed or unsubstantiated services. They used fake invoices for services different from those named in the invoices. There is evidence that Pentler, its principals or other related companies of the principals received from BSGR USD 30 million between 2008 and 2010 in addition to USD 385,000 in 2006.\n\n972.\n\nMs. Tour\u00e9 had no experience or qualifications in the mining sector. Yet, she was promised large amounts of money for her influence over President Cont\u00e9, which influence she indeed exercised to obtain the exploration permits for North and South Simandou for BSGR. She arranged meetings between BSGR and President Cont\u00e9 or Minister Souar\u00e9, and she actively promoted the interests of BSGR to facilitate things for BSGR.\n\n973.\n\nAlthough there is insufficient evidence to prove that Ms. Tour\u00e9 received actual cash payments from BSGR or Pentler in 2006, the record shows that she was paid at least USD 5,234,391.02 between August 2009 and May 2012, of which USD 2,236,391.02 were transferred by Pentler or its intermediaries and USD 2,998,000 were transferred through Mr. Boutros. Although it is not totally clear to what extent these payments relate to North and South Simandou as opposed to Blocks 1 & 2, it appears reasonable to conclude that part of these payments relates to the services Ms. Tour\u00e9 provided in 2005 and 2006 in connection with North and South Simandou.\n\n974.\n\nIn the light of Ms. Tour\u00e9's status as wife of President Cont\u00e9, the Tribunal is of the view that the Claimants engaged in active trading of influence by securing Ms. Tour\u00e9's influence over her husband and other government officials. Notably, there is evidence that Ms. Tour\u00e9 actually influenced the decision-making process and that the desired result was achieved, i.e. BSGR obtained the North and South Simandou Permits. Whether BSGR could have obtained these permits without any influence peddling is irrelevant; the fact is that it did secure undue influence.\n\n975.\n\nMr. Tour\u00e9 did not have any experience or expertise in the mining sector either. Together with Mr. Bah, he received USD 425,000 in February 2006 for his undisclosed services in connection with North and South Simandou. In addition to his regular salary, he also received USD 450,000 as a bonus in 2010, again for services unknown. Here again, considering that Mr. Tour\u00e9 was the half-brother of President Cont\u00e9's wife, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the Claimants engaged in active trading of influence.\n\n976.\n\nFinally, without justification, the Claimants paid several of Minister Thiam's travel expenses in 2009 in an amount of USD 15,424.68. They also paid USD 1,000 to each member of the Technical Commission tasked with negotiating the terms of Base Convention. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants engaged in corrupt practices to secure the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession.\n\n977.\n\nHaving engaged in active trading of influence to secure the North and South Simandou exploration permits and in active bribery to secure the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that all claims related to these mining rights are inadmissible.\n\nv. *Blocks 1 & 2*\n-----------------\n\n978.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to Guinea\u2019s contention that the Claimants benefited from the influence of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and her half-brother over President Cont\u00e9 and government officials to fraudulently obtain mining rights in Blocks 1 & 2.\n\n979.\n\nThe Claimants dispute having obtained these mining rights through corruption. They deny that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was the wife of President Cont\u00e9 or that she otherwise exerted any influence over him, and dispute that Mr. Tour\u00e9 had any influence over the President or members of the government. For them, Rio Tinto\u2019s rights were lawfully withdrawn, because Rio Tinto failed to retrocede 50% of its mining area following the second renewal of the exploration permits in 2002, and BSGR obtained mining rights over Blocks 1 & 2 in compliance with applicable regulation procedures.\n\n980.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that BSGR Guinea was awarded exploration permits over Blocks 1 & 2 on 9 December 2008,1337 following a Presidential Decree in July 2008 to take these blocks away from the previous title holder, Rio Tinto.1338 In 1997, Rio Tinto had obtained four exploration permits in the Simandou mountain region for a period of three years.1339 These permits were renewed in 2000,1340 but Rio Tinto had to return 50% of the exploration area under the Guinean Mining Code.1341 The remaining zones covered by the four exploration permits were designated as Blocks 1 to 4. Blocks 1 & 2 correspond to \"Simandou Nord\" and Blocks 3 & 4 to \"Simandou Sud\". Rio Tinto obtained a second renewal of its permits in October 2002, but failed to then retrocede another 50% of its exploration area as it was required to do.1342 In November 2002, Rio Tinto concluded a mining convention with Guinea.1343 According to that convention, a mining concession should have been awarded within 90 days, which, however, only occurred in 2006.1344\n\nArr\u00eat\u00e9 n\u00b0 A2008/4980/MMG/SGG accordant un permis de recherches mini\u00e8res \u00e0 la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSGR Guin\u00e9e Limited, 9 d\u00e9cembre 2008 (Exh.

As Mr. Avidan tellingly stated at the Merits Hearing: \"Zogota [i.e. South Simandou] was only, I would say, a \"bonus\" to Blocks 1 and 2\".1345\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 9, 168:1-2 (Avidan).\n\n982.\n\nMr. Steinmetz testified in the LCIA arbitration that Messrs. Cilins, Lev Ran and Noy introduced Mr. Oron, the CEO of BSGR, to the opportunity to invest in iron ore mining activities in Guinea and especially in the Simandou area. Mr. Cilins described Mr. Oron's role in this period (2005-2006) as the \"face of BSGR [who] piloted BSGR's efforts\".1346 According to a declaration made by Mr. Cilins in 2011, Mr. Oron reacted to this opportunity by stating that BSGR would be interested in \"obtaining the impossible\" (or in French \"d\u00e9crocher la lune\").1347\n\nRapport d'entretien avec M. Cilins, 5 octobre 2011 (probable), p. 2 (Exh.

In a conversation in early 2005 in Johannesburg with RO, FC asked him what BSGR was after in Guinea and RO responded that BSGR wanted to \"*obtain the moon*\" in Guinea, which meant that RO wanted to obtain the Simandou concession\". Rapport d'entretien avec M. Cilins, 5 octobre 2011 (probable), p. 1 (Exh. R-165).\n\n983.\n\nMr. Cilins subsequently arranged a meeting between Mr. Oron and the Minister of Mines Souar\u00e9 on 20 July 2005,1348 where Mr. Oron expressed his interest for iron mining in Simandou.1349 Mr. Oron thereafter wrote to Minister Souar\u00e9 on 2 August 2005, naming Simandou as BSGR\u2019s first area of interest. That letter remained unanswered.1350\n\nThe Tribunal is mindful of the discrepancy between Minister Souar\u00e9's witness statement, where he stated that he had a first meeting with BSGR at the Presidential Palace in December 2005 and his testimony at the Merits Hearing concerning the 20 July 2005 meeting or \"visit\". At any rate, it is uncontroversial that the 20 July 2005 meeting took place. See: Souar\u00e9 (RWS-2), para. 8; Tr. (Merits), Day 6, 28:22-29:10 (Souar\u00e9).\n\nIn a letter sent to Minister Souar\u00e9 on 2 August 2005, Mr. Oron stated the following: \"Je souhaiterais profiter de cette occasion pour vous remercier tr\u00e8s sinc\u00e8rement de l'amiable accueil que vous nous avez reserv\u00e9, \u00e0 mon \u00e9quipe et \u00e0 moi-m\u00eame, et des propos fort int\u00e9ressants que nous avons \u00e9chang\u00e9s avec vous le 20 juillet 2005.

During that visit, he had a meeting with the Ministry of Mines and Geology and he expressed BSGR's interest in exploration and mining in the country\". Struik (CWS-2), para. 10. See also: [REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n984.\n\nWhile the letter listed other mining opportunities, subsequent exchanges with the Guinean government show that BSGR\u2019s reference to Simandou actually concerned the mining areas of Rio Tinto. For instance, between November 2005 and January 2006, BSGR sent two draft memoranda of understanding to Minister Souar\u00e9 and the CPDM, before a final version was concluded on 20 February 2006. The first draft dated 24 November 2005 shows that BSGR was generally interested in obtaining mining rights in Simandou: \"Ce protocole \u00e0 pour but de permettre la promotion et le d\u00e9veloppement des gisements des minerais de fer de SIMANDOU, ainsi que les infrastructures y aff\u00e9rents\".1351 Mr. Struik confirmed that Mr. Oron\u2019s reference to Simandou did not exclude Blocks 1 to 4.1352\n\nLettre de M. Oron (BSGR) au Ministre Souar\u00e9 joignant un projet de protocole d'accord, 24 novembre 2005 (Exh. R-173).\n\n\"Q. But in the draft that he sent in November, he was expressing an interest in anything in that area? A. Yes. Q. And he didn't exclude Blocks 1, 2, 3 and 4? A. Yes\". Tr. (Merits), Day 4, 83:25-84:4 (Struik).\n\n985.\n\nThe record also shows that, because Rio Tinto had extant mining rights in Simandou, the Guinean government sought to redirect BSGR\u2019s attention to the mining areas to the north and south of Rio Tinto\u2019s concession area, namely \"Simandou Nord\" and \"Simandou Sud\". An undated assessment by the CPDM of the first draft MoU sent by Mr. Oron confirms that BSGR coveted the entire Simandou mountain range: \"La Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSGR Limited ayant la capacit\u00e9 financi\u00e8re et technique souhaite \u00e9tablir l'Etude de Faisabilit\u00e9 *de tout le Simandou* sur financement au moyen de pr\u00eat additionnel et faire la promotion du gisement aupr\u00e8s de grands groupes miniers\".1353 The same assessment states that Rio Tinto's concession area could not be attributed to BSGR and that BSGR could eventually conduct feasibility studies to the north and south of Blocks 1 to 4 as a means to create competition.1354\n\nM\u00e9morandum du CPDM sur le projet de protocole d'accord propos\u00e9 par BSG Resources Limited relatif au projet des mines de fer de Guin\u00e9e, 2005 (Exh.

R-486).\n\n986.\n\nIn addition, although the second draft memorandum dated 6 January 2006 only refers to \"Simandou Nord et Sud\",1355 the final version concluded with Guinea on 20 February 2006 contains a right of first refusal clause for the entire Simandou area.1356\n\nLetter from BSGR to Minister Souar\u00e9, 6 January 2006 (Exh. C-208).\n\nClause 3.2.2.7 of the 20 February 2006 Memorandum reads as follows: \"Le soutien et l'assurance que, si une quelconque zone du site de SIMANDOU devenait libre de tous droits miniers, la dite zone serait propose en priorit\u00e9 \u00e0 BSGR Guinea en vue de son exploration et/ou de son exploitation\". Memorandum of Understanding between Republic of Guinea and BSGR Guinea, 20 February 2006, clause 3.2.2.7 (Exh. C-9).\n\n987.\n\nThis assessment is further corroborated by the following facts: On 1 December 2005, Mr. Cilins met with President Cont\u00e9, a meeting which was also attended by Ms. Tour\u00e9. According to his declaration of 2011, Mr. Cilins pleaded in favor of granting mining rights over Simandou to BSGR at which point President Cont\u00e9 called Minister Souar\u00e9, who told him that Blocks 1 to 4 had already been granted to Rio Tinto.\n\n988.\n\nSurprisingly, at that meeting, President Cont\u00e9 authorized BSGR to make a reconnaissance flight over Simandou with the presidential helicopter. This flight took place on 2 December 2005 and was the cause of an incident because the helicopter landed on Rio Tinto's concession area.1357 This again shows that BSGR was primarily interested in the Simandou area over which Rio Tinto had extant mining rights.\n\nSouar\u00e9 (RWS-2), paras. 11-19.\n\n989.\n\nMr. Souar\u00e9 testified that he convened BSGR's representatives the following day to explain the incident. Ms. Tour\u00e9 also attended that meeting. In his witness statement, Mr. Souar\u00e9 states that he explained to BSGR that Simandou had already been awarded to Rio Tinto and that they should apply for mining areas that had not yet been awarded to a mining company. However, according to Mr. Souar\u00e9, BSGR again pleaded for obtaining the Simandou area: \"Les repr\u00e9sentants de BSGR ont plaid\u00e9 pour obtenir un permis de recherches sur Simandou. Mamadie Tour\u00e9 a appuy\u00e9 la demande\".1358\n\nSouar\u00e9 (RWS-2), para. 18.\n\n990.\n\nIn the course of January 2006, BSGR came to understand that it could only obtain mining rights to the north and south of the Simandou mountains. As seen above, BSGR eventually obtained exploration permits on 6 February 2006 for North and South Simandou. In this context, the Milestone Agreement of 14 February 2006 sets out milestones and corresponding success fees concerning not only the newly obtained mining permits, but also Blocks 1 & 2:\n\n\"Pentler has agreed to continue its efforts to reach an agreement for Blocks 1 and 2 and assist in acquiring these blocks for the Simandou Iron Ore Project, and assist in any possible manner with the Simandou Iron Ore Project.\"1359\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n991.\n\nThe table containing the milestones and the success fees is the following:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Milestone | Total Success Fee |\n| Zones North and South | Blocks 1 and 2 |\n| Signing of the MOU and issuing of corresponding prospecting permits | USD500,000 | USD1,500,000 |\n| Completion of a satisfactory feasibility study and registration of \"Companie Miniere de Fer de Simandou\" | USD500,000 | USD1,000,000 |\n| Signing of \"Convention de Base\" | USD500,000 | USD1,000,000 |\n| Signing of \"Decret Presidentiel de la Concession\" and issuing of corresponding mining permits | USD1,000,000 | USD1,000,000 |\n| Commercial production and export of first tonne of iron ore product from Simandou | USD2,000,000 | NIL |\n| Commercial production and export of first 10 million tonnes of iron orc product from Simandou | USD4,000,000 | NIL |\n| Repayment of all investments by BSGR (Guinea) Limited | USD6,500,000 | NIL |\n| Total | USD15,000,000 | USD4,500,000 |\n\n992.\n\nAs the analysis above about the Zogota mining rights has already shown, Pentler concluded on 20 February 2006 contracts with Messrs. Bah, Daou and Tour\u00e9 containing the same milestones regarding Blocks 1 & 2 as those in the Milestone Agreement.1360 Here too, the aggregate amount of the fees payable to these gentlemen for Blocks 1 & 2 matches the fees provided in the Milestone Agreement, i.e. USD 3,600,000 + USD 900,000 = USD 4,500,000.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n993.\n\nThe fact that BSGR was interested at that time in obtaining Blocks 1 & 2 is further corroborated by Mr. Avidan, who testified that he was aware that BSGR wanted to get Blocks 1 & 2 since the time he arrived in Guinea, i.e. around June 2006.1361\n\n\"Q. You were aware that BSGR wanted to get Blocks 1 and 2 from Simandou from the moment you arrived in Guinea, correct? A. True\". Tr. (Merits), Day 9, 131:21-24 (Avidan).\n\n994.\n\nThe record also shows that BSGR renewed its efforts in 2007 to obtain Blocks 1 & 2. Following a cabinet reshuffle and the appointment of Mr. Kant\u00e9 as Minister of Mines, Mr. Avidan applied for an exploration permit for Blocks 1 & 2 on 12 July 2007, when Rio Tinto still had rights over these blocks.1362 Mr. Avidan's attempts to cast doubt on the date of that application by stating that the letter was actually sent a year later is contradicted by the receipt stamp that is dated 20 July 2007. In addition, Mr. Kant\u00e9 testified that he met with Mr. Avidan and Mr. Tour\u00e9 shortly thereafter and that the first reiterated BSGR's interest for Blocks 1 & 2:\n\n\"Je retiens aussi qu'il a formul\u00e9 aussi des critiques vis-\u00e0-vis de leurs voisins, Rio Tinto, au lieu de parler de leur activit\u00e9 \u00e0 eux: des critiques du genre \"ils sont l\u00e0 depuis longtemps et ils ne font rien\". Asher Avidan m'a parl\u00e9 de l'int\u00e9r\u00eat de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSGr pour les blocs de Rio Tinto.\"1363\n\n\"Dans le cadre de notre partenariat avec l'Etat Guin\u00e9en, nous avons l'honneur de venir vers vous pour vous exprimer notre volont\u00e9 d'\u00e9tendre ce partenariat \u00e0 la recherch\u00e9 et \u00e0 l'exploration des gisements de fer du bloc 1 et 2 de la cha\u00eene de SIMANDOU. A cet effet, il nous plairait d'obtenir les permis de recherche correspondants\" Lettre de M. Avidan (BSGR Guin\u00e9e) au Ministre Sylla, 12 juillet 2007 (Exh. R-214).\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 15.\n\n995.\n\nAccording to Mr. Kant\u00e9, he refused to entertain the request and explained to Mr. Avidan that BSGR Guinea had not shown to have the technical and financial means to conduct exploration activities within its own permit areas of North and South Simandou and that it should focus on these:1364\n\n\"C\u2019est donc vers \u00e7a que je les ai orient\u00e9s: il faut aller travailler les zones que vous avez d\u00e9j\u00e0, avant de pouvoir dire quoique ce soit. J\u2019ai alors dit aux repr\u00e9sentants de BSGR que s\u2019ils n\u2019\u00e9taient pas satisfaits, ils pouvaient rendre leur permis \u00e0 la R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e, plut\u00f4t que de chercher \u00e0 obtenir une concession d\u00e9j\u00e0 attribu\u00e9e \u00e0 une autre soci\u00e9t\u00e9.\"1365\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), paras. 17-19.\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 19.\n\n996.\n\nMr. Kant\u00e9 further testified that, sometime in August 2007, President Cont\u00e9 called him to a meeting attended by Messrs. Avidan and Tour\u00e9 to discuss Blocks 1 & 2.1366 Having explained to President Cont\u00e9 that Rio Tinto already had a mining concession over Blocks 1 to 4, President Cont\u00e9 apparently told Minister Kant\u00e9 to make a decision in the interest of the country, which the Minister understood as validating his own point of view.1367 However, according to Mr. Kant\u00e9, Messrs. Avidan and Tour\u00e9 subsequently came to his office and acted as if he had received formal instructions to award them Blocks 1 & 2.1368\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), paras. 22-23; Tr. (Merits), Day 7, 83:5-9 (Kant\u00e9).\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 26.\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), paras. 27-28.\n\n997.\n\nMinister Kant\u00e9 further refers to a second meeting with President Cont\u00e9 in December 2007 to discuss BSGR and Rio Tinto.1369 He recalls that \"a lady\" was standing next to President Cont\u00e9, whom he assumed to be Mamadie Tour\u00e9.1370 Having explained anew that BSGR had a larger mining area than Rio Tinto and had still not provided any exploration results, President Cont\u00e9 apparently told the lady: \"je t\u2019avais dit de ne pas te m\u00ealer de ces probl\u00e8mes de mines\".1371\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 30.\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 31.\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 33.\n\n998.\n\nThe following day, Minister Kant\u00e9 was called by the Prime Minister Lansana Kouyat\u00e9. The same lady was again present and the Prime Minister introduced her as the fourth wife of the President and said that Minister Kant\u00e9 should find a solution to her problem.1372 For Minister Kant\u00e9, \"[i]l \u00e9tait \u00e9vident que l\u2019objet de la discussion \u00e9tait de trouver un moyen de donner les droits de Rio Tinto \u00e0 BSGR\".1373\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 35.\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 35.\n\n999.\n\nThese facts show that the Claimants targeted Blocks 1 & 2 from the outset and increased their efforts from 2007 onwards. Rio Tinto\u2019s mining rights over Blocks 1 & 2 were eventually suspended on 28 July 2008, revoked on 9 December of that year, and then awarded to the Claimants on the same day.\n\n1000.\n\nWith these considerations in mind, the Tribunal will now assess various red flags concerning the manner in which the Claimants secured their mining rights for Blocks 1 & 2. For the reasons set out in the following sections, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the Claimants obtained the Blocks 1 & 2 exploration permits through corrupt practices. The record shows that BSGR, directly or indirectly, made substantial payments to Ms. Tour\u00e9 and other individuals ((a) below). The record further shows that Ms. Tour\u00e9 and other individuals did not have any specific qualifications in the mining sector ((b) below), that these individuals provided unspecified services ((c) below), that the Claimants failed to conduct meaningful due diligence ((d) below), and that the Claimants sought to destroy or tamper with the evidence showing their involvement in this scheme ((e) below). The record finally shows that BSGR, directly or indirectly, bought the influence that Ms. Tour\u00e9 purported to exert over President Cont\u00e9 and other government officials, and that Ms. Tour\u00e9, her half-brother and other individuals sought to influence the decision-making process ((f) below).\n\n(a) Payments and other gifts\n----------------------------\n\n*Ms. Tour\u00e9*\n-----------\n\n1001.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the record proves that the Claimants paid at least USD 9.5 million to Ms. Tour\u00e9, either directly or through intermediaries, in return for her influence in securing the disputed mining rights. The Respondent also argues that Mr. Avidan gave Ms. Tour\u00e9 USD 1 million in cash in BSGR\u2019s offices in 20081374 and USD 50,000 in cash in Freetown shortly after President Cont\u00e9\u2019s death.1375\n\nCM, para. 343.\n\nCM, para. 381.\n\n1002.\n\nPrior to reviewing the evidence of actual payments, it behooves the Tribunal to set out the promises of payments made to Ms. Tour\u00e9, and in particular the 27 and 28 February 2008 contracts between Mr. Avidan and Ms. Tour\u00e9, the 2 August 2009 \"Attestation\" signed by Ms. Tour\u00e9, and a series of dated and undated contracts believed to be signed in 2010.\n\n1003.\n\nOn 27 and 28 February 2008, Mr. Avidan and Ms. Tour\u00e9 signed two contracts on behalf of BSGR Guinea and Matinda and Co Limited (\"Matinda\"). Matinda was founded for Ms. Tour\u00e9 on 17 November 2006 and registered in the British Virgin Islands with the assistance of the law firm Mossack Fonseca.1376 These two contracts are part of the Disputed Documents, of which the forensic analysis has disproved Mr. Avidan\u2019s and the Claimants\u2019 claims of forgery.\n\nJeune Afrique, Guin\u00e9e: ce que les \u00ab Panama Papers \u00bb disent de Mamadie Tour\u00e9 dans le scandale de corruption du Simandou, 6 avril 2016 (Exh.

The operative part of that contract reads as follows:\n\n\"La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 **BSG Resources** s\u2019engage de donner une somme totale de quatre millions de dollars \u00e0 titre de commission pour l\u2019obtention des blocs 1 et 2 de Simandou situ\u00e9 en R\u00e9publique de Guin\u00e9e et couvrant les pr\u00e9fectures de KEREOUANE et BEYLA.\n\nLa soci\u00e9t\u00e9 **MATINDA AND CO LIMITED** s\u2019engage pour sa part de faire toutes les d\u00e9marches n\u00e9cessaires pour obtenir des autorit\u00e9s la signature pour l\u2019obtention des dits blocs en faveur **de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSG RESOURCES GUINEE**.\n\n**La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSG Resources** se propose de repartir la commission ci-dessus comme suit: Une somme de deux (2) millions pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 **MATINDA AND CO LIMITED** avec imputation de cent (100) USD d\u00e9j\u00e0 vers\u00e9e \u00e0 titre d\u2019avance.\n\nLe reste de la somme sera repartie [sic] entre les personnes de bonne volont\u00e9 qui auraient contribu\u00e9 \u00e0 la facilitation de l\u2019octroi des dits blocs, dans lequel **la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSG Resources Guin\u00e9e** diligentera en raison de la qualit\u00e9 de la contribution de chaque partie.\n\nLa totalit\u00e9 de la somme sera vers\u00e9e sans d\u00e9lai apr\u00e8s la signature du dit document.

As was already mentioned, the forensic analysis has not shown them to be forged. Moreover, Mr. Avidan's statement that he was not in Guinea at the relevant time have been proven wrong. [REDACTED]1379 At the Merits Hearing, he explained that this statement was based on his review of the tickets bought at the travel agency Diesenhaus.1380 When confronted with BSGR Guinea's first quarterly report for 2008 showing that Mr. Steinmetz visited Guinea on 24 and 25 February 2008,1381 he then said that he \"probably\" left Guinea with Mr. Steinmetz on 24 February 2008, to spend his wedding anniversary with his wife on 25 February 2008 in Israel.1382 However, according to the flight log of his private airplane, Mr. Steinmetz arrived in Conakry on 25 February 2008 and left on 26 February 2008 for Monrovia in Liberia, before returning to Israel.1383Faced with this evidence, Mr. Avidan stated that he \"cannot tell [...] for sure\" but that he was \"almost positive\" about travelling back with Mr. Steinmetz to Israel.1384 In the light of the conflicting accounts of Mr. Avidan, the Tribunal attaches no credibility to the testimony of Mr. Avidan on this issue. In consequence, the Tribunal cannot find that Mr. Avidan left Guinea on 26 February 2008. It appears much more plausible that Mr. Avidan signed the disputed contracts on 27 and 28 February 2008 as the contracts themselves indicate.\n\n(\"I was not even in Guinea on 27 or 28 February 2008.

Abdoulaye Ciss\u00e9 and Issiaga Bangoura. This document is also a Disputed Document for which the forensic experts have found no evidence of forgery. In the 2 August 2009 Attestation, Ms. Tour\u00e9 states that USD 4 million are owed to her by BSGR in payment of her 5% shares in BSGR Guinea (which she secured in the Tour\u00e9/Pentler Protocol dated 20 February 2006 by obtaining a free-carry 33% shareholding in Pentler)1385 and her services and that all her prior contractual commitments towards BSGR, its subsidiaries or intermediaries are abrogated:\n\n\"Je soussign\u00e9e Madame MAMADIE TOURE, femme d\u2019affaires r\u00e9sidant dans la commune de Dubr\u00e9ka, Directrice G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 MATINDA AND CO LIMITED, en s\u00e9jour \u00e0 Freetown REPUBLIQUE DE SIERRA LEONE, reconnais avoir finalis\u00e9 avec la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSGR du [sic] versement de la somme de quatre millions (4 000 000 de dollars am\u00e9ricain), repr\u00e9sentant la valeur totale de l\u2019ensemble de mes actions (5% de participation) ainsi que de mes prestations fournies pour l\u2019obtention des titres miniers en faveur de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSGR en terre Guin\u00e9enne.\n\nLes dits montants me seront int\u00e9gralement pay\u00e9s par \u00e9ch\u00e9ance de quatre trimestres soit un million (1 000 000) de dollars par trimestre.\n\nA chaque \u00e9ch\u00e9ance de paiement, je m\u2019engage \u00e0 produire un accus\u00e9 de r\u00e9ception pour la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 qui sera sign\u00e9 et d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par moi-m\u00eame.\n\nEn foi de quoi j\u2019ai \u00e9tabli cette attestation de mani\u00e8re d\u00e9finitive, qui abroge tous mes engagements contractuels ant\u00e9rieurs (directement ou indirectement) li\u00e9s \u00e0 l\u2019\u00e9gard de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSGR, de ses filiales ou toute autre entit\u00e9 interm\u00e9diaire repr\u00e9sentant la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 BSGR apr\u00e8s l\u2019\u00e9ch\u00e9ance totale, pour servir et valoir ce que de droit.\"1386\n\nProtocole Pentler/Mme.

C-115).\n\n1010.\n\nThere appears to be no doubt that Ms. Tour\u00e9 signed the 8 June 2010 writ. As the Respondent suggests, it may well be that Ms. Tour\u00e9 denounced the attestation because she had discovered that Vale was to pay BSGR USD 2.5 billion for a 51% stake and she found that her compensation was too low. [REDACTED]1390 In any event, the only way to assess the veracity of the 2 August 2009 Attestation is to determine whether any monies were transferred to Ms. Tour\u00e9, an issue to which the Tribunal will revert.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1011.\n\nContinuing chronologically, according to the Respondent, BSGR, through Pentler, then proposed to Ms. Tour\u00e9 to sign a series of documents in the summer of 2010 (the \"August 2010 contracts\"), starting with an undated document acknowledging that Ms. Tour\u00e9 had been paid USD 2.4 million from Pentler for their cooperation since 2005:\n\n\"Je, soussign\u00e9e, Madame Mamadie Tour\u00e9, repr\u00e9sentante de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Matinda & Co.

They also commit to maintain the confidentiality of their common business and contracts, and Matinda undertakes not to contact any third parties having participated in the common enterprise and not to go to court without Pentler\u2019s consent:\n\n\"Notre contrat de collaboration sign\u00e9 en 2005 est arrive \u00e0 son terme.

R-32).\n\n1013.\n\nThe evidence also includes an agreement signed by Mr. Noy and Ms. Tour\u00e9 dated 8 July 2010 providing for an additional payment of USD 5 million payable in two installments on dates to be set within 48 hours:\n\n\"Sujet a la bonne [sic] d\u00e9roulement et a la bonne [sic] fonctionnement et la suite de l\u2019op\u00e9ration men\u00e9 [sic] par nos partenaires au projet de Simandu [sic] en Guin\u00e9e, la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Paentler [sic] Holdings Ltd s\u2019engage a [sic] payer a [sic] Mamadie Toure la somme suppl\u00e9mentaire de 5 millions USD payable en deux parties (chaque payement de 2.5 million USD).\n\nLes dates d\u00e9finitives de ces deux payements [sic] seront communiqu\u00e9es en maximum 48 heures apr\u00e8s la date de signature de ce document.\"1393\n\nEngagement de paiement de Pentler envers Mme Tour\u00e9, 8 July 2010 (Exh.

C-117) (Emphasis in the original).\n\n1015.\n\nFinally, there are two agreements between Pentler and Matinda/Ms. Tour\u00e9 dated 3 August 2010 before the Tribunal. The first one appears to set the payment dates for the two installments contemplated in the 8 July 2010 agreement, stipulating that Ms. Tour\u00e9 would receive USD 2.5 million two years after signing and the same amount two years after the first installment. In other words, Ms. Tour\u00e9 was to collect USD 5 million within four years:\n\n\"Sujet au bon d\u00e9roulement et au bon fonctionnement et la bonne suite des operations men\u00e9s [sic] par Pentler et ses partenaires dans toues [sic] les activit\u00e9s en Guin\u00e9e (commerciales, medicaments, mini\u00e8res etc), la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Pentler Holdings Ltd s\u2019engage a [sic] payer a [sic] Mamadie Toure la somme suppl\u00e9mentaire de 5 millions USD payable en deux parties (chaque payement de 2.5 million USD).

R-31).\n\n1016.\n\nThe second document dated 3 August 2010 is similar in content to the undated agreement discussed in paragraph 1012 (Exh. R-32), except that the additional compensation of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Matinda was increased from USD 3.1 million to USD 5.5 million:\n\n\"La soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Matinda & Co. recevra la somme de 5.5 millions pour sa part dans toutes les activit\u00e9s men\u00e9es en Guin\u00e9e.\"1396\n\nContrat Pentler/Matinda/Tour\u00e9, 3 ao\u00fbt 2010 (Exh. R-346).\n\n1017.\n\nHaving described the agreements and other documents on record, the Tribunal now turns to the evidence of payments. As seen above (see paragraph 859), there is documentary evidence in the form of wire transfers and checks showing that Ms. Tour\u00e9 received at least USD 5,234,391.02 between August 2009 and May 2012. Of this amount, the Respondent traced USD 2,236,391.02 coming from Pentler directly (i.e. USD 399,940 from Messrs. Cilins and Lev Ran on 22 July and 15 August 2010) or indirectly through Adam Schiffman (i.e. USD 1,836,451.02 from Olympia Title between 11 October 2011 and 14 May 2012). Moreover, there is documentary evidence that Ms. Tour\u00e9 received USD 2,998,000 from Mr. Boutros, comprising USD 998,000 in August 2009 and USD 2 million in May 2010.\n\n1018.\n\nHowever, on the basis of the three annotated versions of the email between Mr. Noy and Mr. Cilins examined above (see paragraphs 843-859), it appears that Ms. Tour\u00e9 received at least USD 9,419,200 between August 2009 and May 2012, although only USD 5,234,391.02 can be traced through wire transfers and checks.\n\n1019.\n\nIt is unclear which payments correspond to what services. For instance, the 2 August 2009 Attestation indicates without any specification that the USD 4 million correspond to the value of Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s 5% shareholding and her assistance in securing BSGR\u2019s mining rights in Guinea and other documents are not more precise. It is similarly unclear what shareholding is referred to. Is it Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s 5% share in Blocks 1 & 2 in accordance with the 28 February 2008 contract with Mr. Avidan (i.e. BSGR) or her 5% share in the Simandou project according to the 20 February 2006 contract with Mr. Lev Ran (i.e. Pentler)? Finally, it is unclear what services are remunerated. In other words, the Tribunal is unable to determine with a sufficient level of confidence which payments remunerated Ms. Tour\u00e9 for her services in securing the Blocks 1 & 2 Permits, as opposed to the North and South Simandou exploration permits, it being understood that Ms. Tour\u00e9 played no role in securing the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession since these were issued after President Cont\u00e9\u2019s death.\n\n1020.\n\nOne explanation could be that, after President Cont\u00e9\u2019s death in December 2008 and her ensuing inability to influence governmental decision-making, Ms. Tour\u00e9 and the Claimants sought to settle their accounts and that the payments made in 2009 and 2010 referred to Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s overall assistance between 2005 and 2008. Another could be that the payments which the Claimants directly funneled through Mr. Boutros correspond to the services contemplated in the 27 and 28 February 2008 contracts, and that the payments made through Pentler, Mr. Schiffman, and Olympia Title correspond to the contractual arrangements between Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Pentler.\n\n1021.\n\nThe Tribunal need not engage in speculation in this respect. It is sufficient that the facts establish that the Claimants remunerated Ms. Tour\u00e9 with significant amounts for her influence over several decision-making processes leading to the grant of mining rights in favor of the Claimants, including in particular the exploration rights for Blocks 1 & 2.\n\n1022.\n\nFinally, except for Ms. Tour\u00e9's declarations,1397 there is no evidence that Mr. Avidan gave Ms. Tour\u00e9 USD 1 million in cash at the time when Rio Tinto's rights to Blocks 1 & 2 were revoked or USD 50,000 in cash shortly after President Cont\u00e9's death.1398 Mr. Avidan denied having made any cash payments to Ms. Tour\u00e9.1399 In these circumstances, absent any additional evidence, the Tribunal cannot accept that these facts are proven.\n\nD\u00e9claration de Mme Tour\u00e9, 2 d\u00e9cembre 2013, paras. 28, 31 (Exh. R-35).\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 61.\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 154.\n\n*Mr. Tour\u00e9*\n-----------\n\n1023.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimants paid Ibrahima Sory Tour\u00e9 more than USD 800,000, directly or through intermediaries, USD 425,000 through Pentler in February 2006 and a \"bonus\" of USD 450,000 through BSGR Guinea in the summer of 2010.\n\n1024.\n\nOf these allegations, the evidence shows that Mr. Tour\u00e9, who was promoted Vice-President of BSGR Guinea in 2010, received a bonus of USD 450,000 in the summer of 2010, in addition to his regular salary.1400\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n*Messrs. Fofana and Thiam*\n--------------------------\n\n1025.\n\nGuinea also argues that the Claimants made payments to Messrs. Fofana and Thiam for their influence in securing the disputed mining rights.\n\n1026.\n\nIn respect of Mr. Fofana the record indicates that, on 15 December 2008, BSGR wired USD 100,000 to his account.1401 An email from Mr. Avidan shows that the payment was for \"special consulting\" and that it was approved by \"B.\", which Mr. Tchelet confirmed referred to Beny Steinmetz.1402 An email dated 16 December 2008 further demonstrates that Mr. Steinmetz apparently sought to \"accommodate\" Mr. Fofana\u2019s daughter by offering her a job at BSGR.1403\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED] Tr. (Merits), Day 3, 160:18-19 (Tchelet).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1027.\n\nOn 5 February 2009, BSGR wired a further EUR 80,000 to Mr. Fofana.1404 In addition, it paid Mr. Fofana\u2019s travel expenses totaling USD 26,229.48,1405 including USD 7,125.78 for a round-trip Conakry-Washington-Paris between 10 to 21 December 2008;1406 USD 8,017 in January 2009;1407 USD 2,265.34 in April 2009;1408 USD 8,347.66 in May 2009;1409 and USD 473.48 in July 2009.1410\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nRejoinder, para. 501.\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n1028.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Thiam, it was observed earlier that BSGR reimbursed certain travel expenses (USD 4,680.02 in April 2009 for a trip to Paris1411 and USD 10,744.66 in November 2009 for attending the wedding of Mr. Steinmetz\u2019s daughter in Tel Aviv and for a trip to Hong Kong),1412 claiming that it was not unusual \"[t]o reimburse travel expenses for Government officials - in particular in countries where the budget is tight\".1413\n\n[REDACTED]\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nC-PHB2, para. 75(ii).\n\n*President Cont\u00e9*\n-----------------\n\n1029.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants made gifts to President Cont\u00e9, in particular two Land Cruisers in 2008.1414 However, there is insufficient evidence to show that BSGR offered any vehicles to government officials, let alone two Land Cruisers to President Cont\u00e9. The record rather suggests that, if BSGR was involved in giving Land Cruisers (which is not established), they were likely meant for Ms. Tour\u00e9. Indeed, Ms. Tour\u00e9 stated that, when the Blocks 1 & 2 applications were pending, she received two Land Cruisers from Mr. Avidan on behalf of Mr. Steinmetz.1415 President Cont\u00e9 allegedly told her to keep one and give the second to his children. Guinea points to a photograph in the record depicting two red berets flanking a Land Cruiser. Yet again, the picture is not sufficient proof that the vehicle was intended as a present for President Cont\u00e9.1416\n\nCM, para. 824; R-PHB1, para. 462, 3rd item.\n\nD\u00e9claration de Mme Tour\u00e9, 2 d\u00e9cembre 2013, para. 26 (Exh.

R-460).\n\n(b) Qualifications\n------------------\n\n*Ms. and Mr. Tour\u00e9*\n-------------------\n\n1030.\n\nSince the Claimants deny having retained the services of Ms. Tour\u00e9, they did not attempt to justify any of her qualifications, except for stating that her alleged delivery of caterpillars was part of a legitimate business transaction. With respect to Mr. Tour\u00e9, the Claimants argued that he \"was bright and he had good contacts on the ground throughout Guinea in business, politics and mining\".1417 His employment had \"nothing to do with the fact that he was Mamadie Tour\u00e9\u2019s half-brother\".1418 Moreover, because he was Guinean he would more likely be granted a meeting with the President than a representative of a foreign mining company.1419 Mr. Tour\u00e9 would often wait on behalf of Mr. Avidan for a meeting with a minister and advise him when the meeting would start.1420 They further sought to justify his bonus in 2010 because of the conclusion of the joint venture with Vale and his promotion to Vice-President of BSGR Guinea.1421\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 101(iv); (\"Mr Struik introduced me to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cilins and Ibrahima Tour\u00e9, who were apparently working together at the time and had been assisting Mr Struik. Mr Tour\u00e9 was a journalist. He had very good contacts on the ground throughout Guinea and knew lots of people in business, politics and mining. Guinea is a very complex place for a foreigner in terms of outlook and traditions. Having Mr Tour\u00e9 on board, a bright Guinean who acted as an advocate for BSGR, helped us a lot\") Avidan (CWS-3), para. 11.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 101(i).\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 101(ii).\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 101(iii).\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 108.\n\n1031.\n\nAs seen above, it is common ground that Ms. Tour\u00e9 and Mr. Tour\u00e9 had no relevant qualifications and experience in the mining sector. Neither does the record show any other qualifications that may have been of assistance in BSGR\u2019s legitimate operations. It appears that their proximity to President Cont\u00e9 and other decision-makers is the reason for their involvement in BSGR's mining activities in Guinea.\n\n*Mr. Fofana*\n------------\n\n1032.\n\nFinally, with respect to Mr. Fofana, the Claimants argue that he was not a government official when he provided consultancy work for BSGR.1422 They further stated that it was telling that the Respondent did not put any questions to Mr. Avidan regarding Mr. Fofana's role and that therefore Mr. Avidan's statement that he provided \"high level strategic advice\" in 2008 remains undisputed.1423\n\nC-PHB1, para. 181.\n\nReply, Annex I, paras. 110-111; C-PHB1, para. 182.\n\n1033.\n\nThere is little information in the record about Mr. Fofana's qualifications. He apparently was a government official prior to 2000 and became Prime Minister of Guinea in May 2018. There is thus no evidence suggesting that he had special qualifications in the mining sector at the relevant time. Moreover, as seen below, the Claimants did not provide any information what his high-level strategic advice in 2008 consisted of.\n\n(c) Services of payment recipients\n----------------------------------\n\n1034.\n\nThe Tribunal now turns to the question whether the recipients of the payments established in the foregoing section performed services that could support the Claimants' contention that the payments were part of legitimate business transactions.\n\n*Ms. Tour\u00e9*\n-----------\n\n1035.\n\nWith respect to Ms. Tour\u00e9, the Claimants consistently stated that they entertained no business relationship with her, that they never promised or transferred any money to her, and that she manufactured documents for the purposes of extorting money from BSGR.1424 In other words, the Claimants do not allege that Ms. Tour\u00e9 rendered any services, except for the delivery of caterpillars to Mr. Boutros, although they argue that \"BSGR did not know that Mamadie Tour\u00e9 was the supplier of the machinery, but in any event she was part of a legitimate commercial transaction\".1425\n\nFor instance, Mr. Struik stated that \"[t]here was no relationship, direct or indirect, between BSGR and Ms Tour\u00e9 then or at any time later\". Struik (CWS-12), para. 12.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 75.\n\n1036.\n\nAs explained above, the evidence shows that, directly or through intermediaries, BSGR paid to Ms. Tour\u00e9 at least USD 5,234,391.02. It is telling that no services are alleged to justify these payments.\n\n*Mr. Tour\u00e9*\n-----------\n\n1037.\n\nThe Claimants submitted that BSGR Guinea paid Mr. Tour\u00e9 a salary for his work as external relations officer and a bonus of USD 450,000 in connection with the joint venture with Vale.1426\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 108.\n\n1038.\n\nAs was seen when discussing the payments, the Claimants failed to give a credible explanation justifying a bonus of such magnitude, which was substantially higher than those of other local employees.\n\n*Mr. Fofana*\n------------\n\n1039.\n\nThe Claimants asserted that Mr. Fofana \"provided high level strategic advice for a short period in 2008\" and that he was paid accordingly.1427 Mr. Tchelet also described Mr. Fofana\u2019s consultancy work as \"duties related to work outside of normal geology or engineering services\".1428\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 110; C-PHB1, para. 182; CWS-11 (Tchelet), para. 26.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 182; (\"Q. What does 'special consulting' mean? A. I wouldn't have known what he meant, other than it was specifically work that he needed, different to, for example, the normal geology or engineering services; that it was an important factor for promoting the project\") Tr. (Merits), Day 3, 160:8-14 (Tchelet).\n\n1040.\n\nIt is the Claimants\u2019 further argument that they were entitled to retain the services of Mr. Fofana, since he had not held a government function since 2000. They also point out that, while Messrs. Thiam and Fofana were friends, Mr. Thiam stated that they did not engage in private business while he was in office as Minister of Mines. The Claimants also submit that Minister Nab\u00e9 did not say that \"Fofana exerted pressure on him\", and so there is no proof of any pressure by Mr. Fofana on behalf of BSGR to obtain Blocks 1 & 2.1429 Finally, the Claimants argue that \"even if BSGR used Fofana to lobby Thiam, there is nothing illegal about that\", since that is what lobbyists do.1430\n\nC-PHB1, para. 183.\n\nReply, Annex I, para. 111.\n\n1041.\n\nThe Claimants did not provide any evidence of their allegation of \"high level strategic advice\", such as a contract or correspondence demonstrating the reality of such advice. Actually, Mr. Tchelet declared in oral testimony that he had in vain requested a contract to justify the payments to Mr. Fofana.1431\n\n(\"Q. Was there an agreement between BSGR and Mr Fofana? A. I was not aware of such agreement. I did request on several occasions. Q. Because in paragraph 28 of the same witness statement, the second sentence \u2013 top of the page \u2013 you write that: 'Through the audit process, it was brought to BSGR's attention that there had not been a contract in place with Mr Fofana.' A. Yes\") Tr. (Merits), Day 3, 159:13-23.\n\n1042.\n\nMinister Nab\u00e9, who was directly involved in awarding Blocks 1 & 2 to BSGR Guinea, testified that Mr. Fofana had called him to inquire about BSGR's application for Blocks 1 & 2. On that occasion, Mr. Fofana told him that he had heard that President Cont\u00e9 had given instructions to Mr. Nab\u00e9.1432\n\n(\"Ibrahima Kassory Fofana, qui \u00e9tait un ami proche et pour qui j'avais travaill\u00e9 lorsqu'il \u00e9tait Ministres des Finances, m'avait par ailleurs appel\u00e9 pour me parler du dossier. Il n'\u00e9tait plus au gouvernement mais restait un homme d'influence. Je me souviens qu'il m'avait demand\u00e9: 'J'ai appris que le Pr\u00e9sident t'a donn\u00e9 des instructions, donc o\u00f9 on en est?' Je lui ai r\u00e9pondu qu'on \u00e9tait en attente de pr\u00e9sentation du dossier au Conseil des ministres. Il \u00e9tait surpris que le Conseil des ministres se prononce sur un permis de recherches, parce que normalement de simples permis de recherche sont d\u00e9cid\u00e9s au niveau du minist\u00e8re, mais je lui ai r\u00e9pondu que si le Conseil des ministres ne se pronon\u00e7ait pas, je n'allais rien faire\") Nab\u00e9 (RWS-5), para. 20.\n\n1043.\n\nWhile there is no positive evidence that Mr. Fofana pressured Mr. Nab\u00e9 or any other government official to favor BSGR Guinea, the Tribunal is struck by the lack of evidence of legitimate consultancy services, which is compounded by the temporal proximity between the award of Blocks 1 & 2 to BSGR Guinea on 9 December 2008 and the USD 100,000 payment to Mr. Fofana on 15 December 2008. The impression of a lack of legitimate services is reinforced by Mr. Nab\u00e9's reference to a call from Mr. Fofana, mentioning instructions of President Cont\u00e9 in respect of BSGR's application.\n\n*Mr. Thiam*\n-----------\n\n1044.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they reimbursed \"legitimate travel expenses\" of Mr. Thiam1433 (and of Mr. Fofana incurred by Mr. Thiam)1434 and that it was \"standard practice for mining companies in Guinea to pay for the travel of ministers on certain occasions\".1435 They do not allege that these reimbursements were in consideration of any services or in the context of the performance of services.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 185.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 186.\n\nC-PHB1, para. 187.\n\n1045.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent essentially links these payments to securing the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession, not Blocks 1 & 2, except for alleging that Minister Thiam helped the Claimants maintain their rights over Blocks 1 & 2 when Rio Tinto challenged their allocation.1436 Mr. Thiam became Minister of Mines in January 2009, i.e. after the award of Blocks 1 & 2 to BSGR Guinea in December 2008. Hence, the Tribunal is of the view that Mr. Thiam's role in respect of obtaining Blocks 1 & 2 is not relevant and that the assessment carried out above in connection with the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession is sufficient.\n\nRejoinder, paras. 582-588; R-PHB1, para. 471.\n\n1046.\n\nTo conclude, there is no allegation, not to speak of evidence, of legitimate services performed by Ms. Tour\u00e9, and there is no cogent explanation for the alleged services provided by Mr. Fofana. Similarly, the Claimants further failed to explain what services justified the payment of a USD 450,000 bonus to Mr. Tour\u00e9.\n\n(d) Due diligence\n-----------------\n\n1047.\n\nThe analysis carried out has already shown that the Claimants failed to engage in any meaningful due diligence with respect to Ms. and Mr. Tour\u00e9. There is no indication either that they engaged in any sort of diligence with respect to Mr. Fofana or other intermediaries such as Mr. Boutros.\n\n1048.\n\nIn the context of due diligence, the Tribunal also found that the Claimants' accounting practices were deficient, notably allowing \"urgent\" payments without supporting documentation, not properly accounting for purchases and paying \"consulting fees\" without corresponding services.\n\n(e) Witness tampering and destruction of evidence\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n1049.\n\nThe Tribunal already addressed Mr. Cilins' travels to Florida in the spring of 2013 to meet Ms. Tour\u00e9. The analysis of the facts, to which the Tribunal refers (see paragraphs 924-945 above), demonstrated that Mr. Steinmetz had sent Mr. Cilins to convince Ms. Tour\u00e9 to make false oral and written statements and destroy the originals of the Disputed Documents.\n\n1050.\n\nIn short, the facts evidence that BSGR was seeking to cover up how it obtained its mining rights over Blocks 1 & 2 (in addition to North and South Simandou as seen above).\n\n(f) Influence of Ms. and Mr. Tour\u00e9\n----------------------------------\n\n1051.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that Ms. and Mr. Tour\u00e9\u2019s intervention was decisive in the attribution of Blocks 1 & 2 to BSGR Guinea. The Claimants deny any involvement of Ms. Tour\u00e9 and dispute that Mr. Tour\u00e9 unduly influenced the decision-making process. The record shows otherwise.\n\n1052.\n\nThe Tribunal starts by recalling that a showing of actual influence over public officials is not required under the applicable standard, and that it is sufficient for the purposes of subparagraph (c) of Article 6.1 of the ECOWAS Protocol to show an attempt of active influence peddling. As it will become clear through the following analysis, Ms. Tour\u00e9 and her half-brother actively influenced the decision-making process leading to the issuance the BSGR Guinea\u2019s exploration permits over Blocks 1 & 2.\n\n1053.\n\nMr. Kant\u00e9 was Minister of Mines between March 2007 and August 2008. The record shows that he consistently refused to entertain BSGR\u2019s requests to obtain mining rights over Blocks 1 & 2 and it appears that he was sacked in August 2008 because of that resistance. He explained to Messrs. Avidan and Tour\u00e9 in August 2007 that Rio Tinto had mining rights over these areas and that BSGR had not evinced the financial and technical capacity to develop the mining areas over which they already had mining rights.1437 Mr. Kant\u00e9 was then summoned to a meeting with the President in September 2007. Tellingly, Messrs. Avidan and Tour\u00e9 were already there when he arrived and stayed after he left.1438 He repeated to President Cont\u00e9 what he had told Messrs. Avidan and Tour\u00e9 the month before.1439 Some time later, the two gentlemen showed up in Mr. Kant\u00e9\u2019s office, acting as if President Cont\u00e9 had given clear instructions to grant Blocks 1 & 2 to BSGR,1440 but Mr. Kant\u00e9 reiterated that he had received no such instructions.1441\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), paras. 16-19.\n\nMr Ahmed Kante Declaration, 8 July 2015, p. 3 (Exh. C-81).\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 25.\n\n(\"Asher Avidan s'est adress\u00e9 \u00e0 moi comme si le Pr\u00e9sident avait donn\u00e9 des instructions formelles que je devais ex\u00e9cuter concernant Simandou. C'\u00e9tait comme s'ils revenaient pour dire 'voil\u00e0, on vient finaliser tout \u00e7a'. Je ne sais pas ce qui s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 entre temps, mais c'\u00e9tait paradoxal qu'ils reviennent vers moi, une heure apr\u00e8s, pour me dire \u00e7a. J'aurais pu croire que l'entretien \u00e0 la Pr\u00e9sidence s'\u00e9tait pass\u00e9 sans moi\") Kant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para 28; (\"Les gens de BSGR me disaient: voil\u00e0, nous sommes l\u00e0, que faut-il faire \u00e0 present ? Ils me parlaient comme si j'\u00e9tais competent, ou si j'avais re\u00e7u des instructions, sur la suite \u00e0 donner \u00e0 leur demande sur les concessions de Simandou\") Mr Ahmed Kant\u00e9 Declaration, 8 July 2015, p. 3 (Exh. C-81).\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 28.\n\n1054.\n\nThe record contains an email sent on 18 September 2007 by Mr. Avidan to Messrs. Steinmetz, Struik and Saada. It mentions a meeting with the \"Minister of mines\" concerning BSGR's requests to have \"Aredor and blocks 1 and 2\", and includes a section entitled Blocks 1 and 2, which reflects Mr. Avidan's understanding that President Cont\u00e9 would take away Blocks 1 & 2 from Rio Tinto in spite of Mr. Kant\u00e9's reluctance:\n\n\"Since we are talking about taking them away from a huge company like Rio Tinto, they will need to have a real argument to hand it over to us. Therefore the minister suggested that we prepare a presentation of all the investments that we have made and all the work that we have done over the past 12 months. *Soon after this presentation, the President will take it away from Rio Tinto who are not doing anything in those two blocks, and will hand it over to BSGR.\"1442*\n\n[REDACTED] Emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n1055.\n\nIt is further noteworthy that Mr. Avidan conceded at the Merits Hearing that he complained about Minister Kant\u00e9's reluctance to President Cont\u00e9:\n\n\"I went to the President and I complained that - I went to the President and I complained to him [...] I smuggled the fact that Mr Kant\u00e9 was not happy to give us the block, and he told me, 'Okay, we will organize sometime a meeting with him'. And he really, really, in one of the meetings, called him - I think it was a week afterwards, and he was quite angry on him, I would say.\"1443\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 9, 190:9-10 and 20-25 (Avidan).\n\n1056.\n\nMost importantly, the 18 September 2007 email ends with a reference to \"pushing\" \"key people in the country\", including the President, Ms. Tour\u00e9, and Prime Minister Kouyat\u00e9, to \"reduce [...] problems\":\n\n\"In the next few days I am going to meet some of the *key people in the country including the Prime Minister, the Lady and maybe the President to push them forward so as to reduce some technical and administrative problems*.\"1444\n\n[REDACTED] Emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n1057.\n\nMr. Avidan's statement at the Merits Hearing that he meant to push Ms. Tour\u00e9 *not* to intervene so as not to *create* problems makes no sense in the context. The email is clear: Ms. Tour\u00e9 was used to \"reduce some technical and administrative problems\". In other words, the Claimants were relying on Ms. Tour\u00e9's influence to obtain Blocks 1 & 2.\n\n1058.\n\nMr. Kant\u00e9 was called to another meeting with President Cont\u00e9 in December 2007 to discuss BSGR's file. This meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Kouyat\u00e9 and a \"lady\", who turned out to be Ms. Tour\u00e9 (see below paragraphs 1060-1061). According to Mr. Kant\u00e9, he reiterated to the President that BSGR was seeking mining rights over areas attributed to Rio Tinto, upon which President Cont\u00e9 told the \"lady\": *\"je t\u2019avais dit de ne pas te m\u00ealer de ces probl\u00e8mes de mines\".1445*\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 33.\n\n1059.\n\nAlthough this does not suggest that President Cont\u00e9 issued instructions to favor BSGR, it does demonstrate that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was involved in BSGR's quest for Blocks 1 & 2 and that she discussed the issue with her husband.\n\n1060.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Kant\u00e9 testified that the following day he was called to another meeting with Prime Minister Kouyat\u00e9 that was also attended by Ms. Tour\u00e9.1446 According to Mr. Kant\u00e9, the Prime Minister told him that the lady was the fourth wife of President Cont\u00e9 and that a solution should be found to accommodate her: \"we have to find a solution to this problem, this is the President's wife\".1447 Mr. Kant\u00e9 again refused upon which Mr. Kouyat\u00e9 apparently told Ms. Tour\u00e9: \"tu vois, c\u2019est ce que je t\u2019avais dit de lui\", which showed that they had previously talked about his resistance.1448\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 35.\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 35; (\"Il me dit: tu reconnais cette dame, c'est celle qui \u00e9tait hier avec le Pr\u00e9sident. En effet, c'\u00e9tait elle. Le Premier Ministre me dit: il faut trouver une solution \u00e0 ce probl\u00e8me, c'est la femme du Pr\u00e9sident.

Steinmetz and Struik in April 2008 in Dubreka. [REDACTED]1452 While Mr. Struik denied attending a meeting with President Cont\u00e9 in the presence of Mr. Steinmetz, Mr. Steinmetz confirmed that \"sometime after February 2008\" he met with President Cont\u00e9,1453 who told him that he \"was keen that we replicate the work on Zogota in blocks 1 and 2\".1454\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nSteinmetz (CWS-1), para. 20.\n\nSteinmetz (CWS-1), para. 20.\n\n1065.\n\nMs. Tour\u00e9 added that Mr. Steinmetz informed President Cont\u00e9 that he wanted to develop Blocks 1 & 2 and offered the President a diamond-incrusted miniature car as well as some money. President Cont\u00e9 refused the money, but responded that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was there to help BSGR.1455\n\nD\u00e9claration de Mme Tour\u00e9, 2 d\u00e9cembre 2013, para. 23 (Exh. R-35).\n\n1066.\n\nApparently, a second meeting between President Cont\u00e9 and Mr. Steinmetz was held at the Presidential Palace in April 2008 to discuss BSGR's activities. Mr. Avidan confirmed that he attended that meeting and that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was also present.1456 According to Ms. Tour\u00e9, she asked President Cont\u00e9 to give Blocks 1 & 2 to BSGR, which prompted the President to direct Mr. Mamady Sam Soumah, the Secretary-General of the Presidency, to investigate Rio Tinto's mining rights.1457 Although Mr. Avidan denies any active involvement by Ms. Tour\u00e9 at that meeting, he confirmed that President Cont\u00e9 called Mr. Soumah and instructed him to review Rio Tinto's mining rights.1458 Ms. Tour\u00e9 mentioned that Mr. Soumah proposed to divide the four blocks between four mining companies, but that President Cont\u00e9 told him to divide them between BSGR and Rio Tinto.1459\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 125; Tr.

Minister Kant\u00e9 was dismissed shortly thereafter and replaced by Minister Nab\u00e9. Mr. Nab\u00e9 confirmed that it was \"not at all common practice\" to copy the Secretary-General of the Presidency on mining applications and added that it was \"characteristic\" of the presidential involvement:\n\n\"Q.

The evidence further shows that Ms. Tour\u00e9 sent her half-brother, Mr. Tour\u00e9, on her behalf to exert pressure on government officials so that BSGR would be awarded Blocks 1 & 2.\n\n1073.\n\nTurning now to Mr. Tour\u00e9, it is undisputable that he is the half-brother of Ms. Tour\u00e9. Mr. Avidan conceded that Mr. Tour\u00e9 told him so \"[s]hortly after [his] arrival in Conakry\" mid-2006 and added that she was an \"influential lady\"1472 and that Mr. Avidan should \"go and see her\"1473 to \"make sure that she was happy\".1474 It is thus beyond doubt that the Claimants were aware of this relationship since 2006.1475\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 109.\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 109.\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 114.\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 109.\n\n1074.\n\nIt emerges from the record that BSGR used Mr. Tour\u00e9's family connection to Ms. Tour\u00e9 to gain access to the President, and that Mr. Tour\u00e9 made use of his proximity to the Presidency.\n\n1075.\n\nFirst, the Claimants gave no plausible explanation for hiring Mr. Tour\u00e9. Mr. Avidan's testimony on this topic lacks consistency. Mr. Avidan said that Mr. Tour\u00e9 arranged meetings with the Prime Minister and the President,1476 and that \"it was more effective for me to take a Guinean national to the government offices when arranging meetings\".1477 He also mentioned that Mr. Tour\u00e9 \"knew the country much better than me\",1478 including \"the politics, the tradition\".1479 However, when asked whether Mr. Tour\u00e9 had \"good contacts in politics and in business\", Mr. Avidan answered \"[n]o, I don't think so\".1480 He added that Mr. Tour\u00e9 did not have contacts with \"the people that we were in touch with in the ministry\" and that he only knew \"very low-key\" bureaucrats in the Ministry of Mines.1481 Asked further if the essence of his role was \"just setting up meetings with low-level people\", Mr. Avidan agreed and added that he would also talk to the press and travel to villages to increase the external relations of BSGR.1482 At the same time, he testified that Mr. Tour\u00e9 would accompany him to high-level ministry meetings \"say 80% of the time\", and that when he would visit the President, Mr. Tour\u00e9 \"was with me, *of course\".1483* In fact, various ministers confirmed that Mr. Tour\u00e9 attended meetings with Mr. Avidan.1484 If Mr. Tour\u00e9's task was to wait in the corridors of ministries to let Mr. Avidan know when a minister was available, as Mr. Avidan describes it,1485 one fails to see why Mr. Tour\u00e9 would then participate in such high-level meetings.\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 132.\n\nAvidan (CWS-3), para. 45.\n\nTr.

It is uncontroverted that he was a journalist and had \"no mining background\", as Mr. Struik conceded.1486 Neither did he have experience interacting with government officials.\n\nStruik (CWS-2), para. 17.\n\n1077.\n\nThird, the convergent testimonies of the Respondent's witnesses corroborate that Mr. Tour\u00e9 was making use of his family relationships and proximity to the President as a means to put pressure on relevant decision-makers. Minister Nabe gave evidence that Mr. Tour\u00e9 presented himself as Ms. Tour\u00e9's brother.1487 According to Minister Souare, it was well- known that Mr. Tour\u00e9 was acting on behalf of his half-sister.1488 Minister Sylla similarly stated that Mr. Tour\u00e9 told him that Ms. Tour\u00e9 was using her influence to help BSGR gaining access to the President.1489\n\nNab\u00e9 (RWS-5), para. 7.\n\nSouar\u00e9 (RWS-2), paras. 15, 27.\n\n(\"Il \u00e9tait connu que Mamadie Tour\u00e9 usait de son influence pour certaines soci\u00e9t\u00e9s et notamment que BSGR avait ses entr\u00e9es au palais gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 elle. Je l'ai appris directement de son demi-fr\u00e8re, Ibrahima Sory Tour\u00e9. Il m'a expliqu\u00e9 quand je l'ai rencontr\u00e9 que BSGR avait le soutien de Mamadie Tour\u00e9. J'ai appris aussi qu'elle avait exerc\u00e9 des pressions sur mon pr\u00e9d\u00e9cesseur, Ahmed Tidiane Souar\u00e9, pour qu'il attribue des droits \u00e0 BSGR. Plusieurs cadres qui travaillaient \u00e0 la Pr\u00e9sidence me l'ont dit\") Sylla (RWS-1), para. 15.\n\n1078.\n\nFor all these reasons, there is no doubt in the Tribunal\u2019s mind, that BSGR retained the services of Mr. Tour\u00e9 because of his relationship with Ms. Tour\u00e9 in order to facilitate access to the President and that Mr. Tour\u00e9 took advantage of his closeness to Ms. Tour\u00e9 to pressure decision-makers. Minister Nab\u00e9 confirmed that this was also the case with respect to Blocks 1 & 2.1490\n\nNab\u00e9 (RWS-5), paras. 8-9, 17.\n\n(g) Conclusion\n--------------\n\n1079.\n\nThere is overwhelming evidence that the Claimants obtained their mining rights for Blocks 1 and 2 through corrupt practices. Since 2005 they were interested in mining Blocks 1 & 2, over which Rio Tinto had existing rights. While they accepted the North and South Simandou exploration permits in 2006 as the best available alternative given the circumstances, they devised a scheme to have Guinea through President Cont\u00e9 strip Blocks 1 & 2 away from Rio Tinto and award them to themselves. Ms. Tour\u00e9 and her half-brother were key players in this endeavor, since they had direct access to the president and top governmental officials.\n\n1080.\n\nThere is direct evidence that the Claimants bought the influence that Ms. Tour\u00e9 had over her husband and other government officials. Mr. Avidan concluded with her two contracts of corruption on 27 and 28 February 2008, the authenticity of which has been established in these proceedings. The first contract provided for the payment of USD 4 million in exchange for Ms. Tour\u00e9\u2019s assistance in securing the Blocks 1 & 2 Permits (USD 2 million for Ms. Tour\u00e9 via Matinda and USD 2 million to be distributed to persons of goodwill). BSGR Guinea committed in the second contract to grant her a 5% share in Blocks 1 & 2. It is also established through wire transfers and checks that the Claimants paid Ms. Tour\u00e9 at least USD 5.2 million between 2009 and May 2012 (other documents evince that she received USD 9,419,200 in that period). As discussed above (see paragraphs 843-859 and 1018-1019), the evidence shows that Ms. Tour\u00e9 received from BSGR (directly or indirectly) at least USD 9,419,200 between August 2009 and May 2012, of which USD 5,234,391.02 can be traced through wire transfers and checks, for her services in securing permits for North and South Simandou, as well as Blocks 1 & 2.\n\n1081.\n\nThe record also shows that Ms. Tour\u00e9 actually exerted her influence over government officials, in particular her husband, and that the coveted mining rights were ultimately awarded to BSGR Guinea on 9 December 2008. Ms. Tour\u00e9 was instrumental in setting up at least one meeting between the President and Mr. Steinmetz after February 2008 to discuss Blocks 1 & 2. As a result, the President instructed his Secretary-General, Mr. Soumah, to short-circuit the Ministry of Mines and to investigate and ultimately take away Rio Tinto's mining rights. Ms. Tour\u00e9, just like her half-brother, were also instrumental in setting up meetings with the Ministers of Mine, Messrs. Kante and Nabe, and there is reason to believe, although there is no clear evidence, that they may have played a role in obtaining Mr. Kante's dismissal when he persisted in refusing to grant Blocks 1 & 2 to the Claimants.\n\n1082.\n\nThe Claimants also secured the influence that Mr. Tour\u00e9 through his half-sister could yield over government officials. In addition to his salary, Mr. Tour\u00e9 received in 2010 a bonus of USD 450,000, which amount bears no proportion to the bonuses paid to other local employees of BSGR.\n\n1083.\n\nAdditional factors buttress the fact of corruption. The Claimants and some of their associates went to extraordinary lengths to cover up the corruption practices, using intermediaries to bribe third parties or secure their influence, falsifying invoices, using improper accounting techniques, thus rendering payments untraceable, tampering with evidence, and making statements even before this Tribunal contrary to the facts with respect to the authenticity of key documents.\n\n1084.\n\nFor the sake of completeness, there is proof that Mr. Fofana received money for unidentified consulting services, but there is insufficient evidence in the record that he sought to influence or pressure decision-makers. Thus, while Mr. Fofana's involvement and remuneration raise red flags, it is not established that his role exceeded regular lobbying activities.\n\n1085.\n\nTo conclude on the claims, the foregoing review of the facts reveals that all the mining rights from which this dispute arises, i.e. the North and South Simandou exploration permits, the Base Convention, the Zogota Mining Concession, and the Blocks 1 & 2 Permits, were acquired through corrupt practices. As discussed earlier, the applicable legal norms proscribe corruption. Guinean law sanctions active bribery and trading of influence. Similarly, Article 6.1 of the ECOWAS Protocol, which the Respondent ratified on 20 December 2002, adopts a broad definition of corruption encompassing active bribery and trading of influence, including the mere attempt to exercise influence. Moreover, international public policy prohibits not only active bribery, but also trading of influence to the extent that such influence is exercised to obtain an undue advantage from a public official. In application of these norms and line with other arbitral decisions, the Tribunal held earlier that claims arising from an investment made through corrupt practices were inadmissible. Since all the claims in these proceedings derive from mining rights secured through corrupt practices, they must be declared inadmissible.\n\n1086.\n\nIn light of this conclusion, the Tribunal must address the counterclaims.\n\n**D. Counterclaims**\n--------------------\n\n**1. Parties\u2019 positions**\n-------------------------\n\n1087.\n\nRelying on Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Article 40 of the Arbitration Rules,1491 the Respondent requests that the Tribunal declare the Claimants liable for the economic and moral damages it suffered as a consequence of the Claimants' corrupt dealings to obtain their mining rights.1492 The Respondent further requests that the Tribunal order the Claimants to provide compensation for the moral damages caused by the Claimants' false public statements.1493\n\nCM, paras. 1129-1131.\n\nCM, para. 1126.\n\nCM, para. 1126.\n\n1088.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Claimants' implementation of a \"complex scheme of corruption\" to obtain their mining rights constitutes a gross violation of Guinean law triggering the Claimants' liability under Article 17 of the 1995 Mining Code and the Base Convention.1494 The corrupt dealings by BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea deprived Guinea of the opportunity to develop the mining areas.1495 In addition, Guinea had to expend significant amounts to uncover the scheme. Finally, the \"large scale corruption\" undertaken by the Claimants and their \"unfounded and untruthful declarations\" in the media, including by having recourse to fake emails, about Guinea\u2019s alleged attempts to extort money from the Claimants, has tarnished Guinea\u2019s reputation.1496\n\nCM, paras. 1134-1138.\n\nCM, para. 1141.\n\nCM, para. 1152-1155 (Translated from the French).\n\n1089.\n\nThe Claimants respond that the counterclaims are \"completely exaggerated and unsubstantiated\".1497 For them, the Respondent failed to provide a legal basis to claim moral or economic damages.1498 In particular, moral damages are only awarded in exceptional circumstances, none of which are present here.1499 Finally, the Claimants argue that the counterclaims cannot be pursued against BSGR, i.e. Claimant 1, because of the latter\u2019s placement under joint administration.\n\nReply, para. 467.\n\nReply, para. 494.\n\nReply, paras. 495-496.\n\n1090.\n\nMore specifically, the Claimants submit that damages claimed result from Guinea\u2019s \"own failure to develop its local iron ore industry and the corruption that has been rife in Guinea for decades\",1500 a state of affairs for which the Claimants cannot be held responsible.1501 Relying on Mr. Ferreira, the Claimants argue that the Simandou project is not a \"viable project\".1502 This is demonstrated, for instance, by the fact that Rio Tinto failed to develop Blocks 1 to 4 between 1997 and 2008.1503 In addition, the Claimants had no involvement in Guinea\u2019s decision to withdraw Rio Tinto\u2019s mining rights. In the end, Guinea\u2019s predicament is due to the fact that President Cond\u00e9 revoked the Claimants\u2019 mining rights for \"corrupt reasons\", which in turn caused \"the delays that resulted in the current situation\".1504 Therefore, the Respondent cannot complain about its difficulties in attracting potential investors.1505\n\nReply, para. 467.\n\nReply, para. 472.\n\nReply, para. 474.\n\nReply, para. 478.\n\nReply, para. 482.\n\nReply, para. 484.\n\n1091.\n\nFurthermore, the Claimants argue that Guinea must bear the costs of investigating its own allegations, especially since it \"created the allegations of corruptions [sic] against BSGR to mask the corrupt reasons behind President Conde's decision to cancel this investment\".1506 They also claim that they are not responsible for Guinea's tarnished image, in particular since corruption has been rampant in the country for 50 years.1507 Finally, the Claimants deny having disseminated \"untrue information\".1508\n\nReply, para. 486.\n\nReply, paras. 487-488.\n\nReply, para. 493.\n\n**2. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1092.\n\nThe Tribunal will first address two preliminary issues, namely its jurisdiction over the counterclaims (a) and the effect of the placement of BSGR in administration under Guernsey law (b). Thereafter, if appropriate, it will rule on the admissibility (c) and merits of the counterclaims (d).\n\n**a. Jurisdiction**\n-------------------\n\n1093.\n\nArticle 46 of the ICSID Convention reads in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall, if requested by a party, determine any [...] counterclaims arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute provided that they are within the scope of the consent of the parties and are otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"\n\n1094.\n\nSimilarly, ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(1) provides in relevant part as follows:\n\n\"Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present [a] counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\"\n\n1095.\n\nThe Claimants do not dispute - and rightly so - that these requirements are met. The Tribunal agrees that the counterclaims are within the jurisdiction of the Centre as circumscribed by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and discussed in paragraphs 285 to 290 above and that it fulfills the connexity requirement (\"arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute\"). This conclusion is subject to the situation that results from BSGR's receivership and is addressed next.\n\n**b. Receivership of BSGR**\n---------------------------\n\n1096.\n\nOn 7 March 2018, the Claimants notified the Tribunal and the Respondent that, by court order dated 6 March 2018 of the Royal Court of Guernsey, BSGR (i.e. Claimant 1) had been placed under the joint administration of Malcolm Cohen (BDO LLP London) and William Callewaert (BDO Limited Guernsey) (the \"Administrators\").1509 On 12 March 2018, the Tribunal requested that the Administrators provide their views on the status of BSGR as a party to the arbitration.\n\nLetter of 7 March 2018 by the Claimants to the Tribunal.\n\n1097.\n\nOn 19 March 2018, the Administrators stated that it was in the best interests of BSGR that the arbitration be continued by BSGR, but that a statutory moratorium under Guernsey law entailed that counterclaims could not be commenced against a company in administration. Two days later, they clarified that this rule also applied to the continuation of a counterclaim without the consent of the Administrators and added that they did not give their consent.\n\n1098.\n\nOn 22 March 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that Claimant 1 would henceforth be referred to \"BSGR (In Administration)\". It further took note that the Administrators consented to BSGR pursuing the arbitration, but did not agree with the continuation of the proceedings in relation to the counterclaims.\n\n1099.\n\nOn 17 April 2018, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to determine that the placement under administration of Claimant 1 had no impact on the continuation of the counterclaims. It essentially argued that Guernsey law had no extraterritorial effects and that there was no justification for staying the counterclaims against BSGR.\n\n1100.\n\nIt is undisputed that the placement of BSGR under administration has no effect on the counterclaims asserted against BSGR Guernsey and BSGR Guinea (i.e. Claimants 2 and 3). The Administrators confirmed so expressly when stating that \"the administration proceedings over the Company [i.e. BSGR] have no direct effect on the status of its subsidiaries, including BSG Resources (Guinea) Limited and BSG Resources (Guinea) Sarl, which continue to have the ability to participate in the arbitration and whose corporate governance remains unchanged\".1510\n\nLetter of 19 March 2018 from the Administrators to the Tribunal, p. 2.\n\n1101.\n\nAccordingly, the only issue to be resolved is whether the Administrators\u2019 missing consent has any effect on the Tribunal's jurisdiction over BSGR or on the admissibility of the counterclaims as they are directed against BSGR.\n\n1102.\n\nAs the analysis below will show, the Tribunal regards the counterclaims as inadmissible. Therefore, it can dispense with assessing the effect on jurisdiction of the Administrators\u2019 missing consent.\n\n**c. Admissibility of the counterclaims**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n1103.\n\nThe counterclaims seek relief for the harm caused to the State by the Claimants\u2019 corrupt practices. The legal framework discussed in connection with the admissibility of the claims is thus equally relevant in the present context. Hence, the Tribunal refers to its developments dealing with Guinean and international law governing corruption. In respect of the facts underlying the counterclaims, it recalls that passive corruption as well as passive trading of influence are prohibited as a matter of Guinean and international law. Indeed, Articles 192 and 195 of the Guinean Criminal Code outlaw, respectively, passive corruption and passive trading of influence. Moreover, the broad definition of corruption contained Article 6.1 of the ECOWAS Protocol encompasses active *and* passive bribery and trading of influence.\n\n1104.\n\nIt goes without saying that the inadmissibility of claims does not automatically lead to a finding of inadmissibility of counterclaims. However, here the harm caused by the Claimants\u2019 actions would not have occurred if the Guinean state officials in charge of making the controversial decisions or persons close to them had not been on the receiving end of the corruption scheme. Had they resisted the corruption attempts, BSGR\u2019s mining applications would have been processed legally without undue influence, and the damage for which the counterclaims seek reparation would never have been inflicted.\n\n1105.\n\nOne might object that the relevant government officials acted *ultra vires* and thus their acts cannot be attributed to the State. That objection could not be sustained. As a matter of international law, the conduct of State officials is attributable to the State, even if these officials act *ultra vires.* Article 7 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, which reflects the current state of international customary law, so provides:\n\n\"The conduct of an organ of a State or of a person or entity empowered to exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law if the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, *even if it exceeds its authority or contravenes instructions.\"1511*\n\nILC, Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Official Records of the General Assembly, Fifty-sixth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/56/10), reproduced in the annex to General Assembly resolution 56/83 of 12 December 2001 (Emphasis added by the Tribunal).\n\n1106.\n\nIt results from the foregoing discussion that President Cont\u00e9 acted in favor of BSGR under the influence of his wife who was paid to exercise that influence. Specifically, with respect to the North and South Simandou exploration licenses, President Cont\u00e9 accepted that members of his family, i.e. Ms. Tour\u00e9 and her half-brother, be paid for the influence they exerted over the decision-making process leading to the award of the exploration rights. He also pressured Ministers Kant\u00e9 and Nab\u00e9 to award to BSGR the licenses for Blocks 1 & 2, being aware that the Claimants would remunerate his wife. In addition, Minister Thiam accepted bribes from the Claimants to assist in securing the Base Convention and the Zogota Mining Concession. In other words, had President Cont\u00e9 and inister Thiam acted lawfully and refused the favors which they (or members of his family in respect of the former) were offered in exchange for facilitating the grant of mining rights, the counterclaims would never have been brought.\n\n1107.\n\nWhen assisting the Claimants in their unlawful enterprise, President Cont\u00e9 and Mr. Thiam acted in their respective capacities of head of State and minister. Even if they exceeded their powers, their conduct is thus attributable to Guinea.\n\n1108.\n\nThis state of affairs is aggravated by a number of other elements. Minister Kant\u00e9 was demoted in August 2008 at the time of the Claimants\u2019 attempts to be awarded rights over Blocks 1 & 2. Although there is no direct evidence that Mr. Kant\u00e9 was demoted because of his opposition to BSGR,1512 it is plausible that he was dismissed because he was resisting President Cont\u00e9\u2019s pressure for him to grant Blocks 1 & 2 to the Claimants. Mr. Kant\u00e9 stated that he was the only minister who was removed in August 2008 and he believed that it was because of his \"reputation of incorruptible\".1513 There is indeed evidence that Minister Kant\u00e9 repeatedly opposed BSGR\u2019s attempts to obtain Blocks 1 & 2. It is also established that, at least Mr. Avidan, who considered himself to have the \"ear of the President\"1514 was very displeased with Mr. Kant\u00e9.1515 In fact, Mr. Avidan testified that he personally complained to President Cont\u00e9 about Mr. Kant\u00e9\u2019s intransigeance:\n\n\"Yes. I went to the President and I complained that - I went to the President and I complained to him. [...] And in one stage I told him - you know, I smuggled the fact that Mr Kant\u00e9 was not happy to give us the block, and he told me, \"Okay, we will organize sometime a meeting with him\". And he really, really, in one of the meetings, called him - I think it was a week afterwards, and he was quite angry on him, I would say.\"1516\n\nFor instance, his successor Minister Nab\u00e9 testified that he had no idea why Mr. Kant\u00e9 had been dismissed. Tr. (Merits), Day 8, 120:19-25 (Nab\u00e9).\n\nKant\u00e9 (RWS-4), para. 43.\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 9, 191:9-11 (Avidan).\n\n[REDACTED]\n\nTr. (Merits), Day 9, 190:9-10 and 20-25 (Avidan).\n\n1109.\n\nAnother aggravating circumstance is that Guinea did not initiate criminal proceedings against most persons implicated in BSGR\u2019s corrupt dealings and in particular not against government officials. For instance, the Respondent alleged that the Claimants bought the influence of Mr. Fofana to pressure Minister Nab\u00e9 to grant Blocks 1 & 2. There is no indication that Guinea ever opened a criminal investigation into Mr. Fofana\u2019s conduct, who became Prime Minister in May 2018. There is no mention either of investigations in Guinea against Messrs. Thiam and Soumah. The Tribunal has not been made aware either of any proceedings initiated against Ms. Tour\u00e9 in Guinea, although the Tribunal understands that Guinea assisted Ms. Tour\u00e9 to cooperate in criminal proceedings in Switzerland and the United States. This lack of action against corrupt government agents and others close to them is particularly troublesome knowing that, as the Respondent concedes,1517 corruption was pervasive at the highest levels of the Guinean government for decades.\n\nCM, paras. 49, 51, 853-856; Duplique, paras. 611-614.\n\n1110.\n\nTo conclude, President Cont\u00e9 and Minister Thiam acted unlawfully by accepting favors (or letting family members do so) in consideration for exercising their influence over the attribution of mining rights to BSGR. Their conduct is proscribed under Articles 192 and 195 of the Guinean Criminal Code, as well as Article 6.1 of the ECOWAS Protocol. The Tribunal further notes that the Respondent concedes that general principles of international law, such as *nemo auditur propriam turpitudinem allegans, ex dolo malo non oritur action,* or *ex turpi causa non oritur actio,* which all bar claims resulting out of the Claimant\u2019s own wrongful acts, aim at sanctioning fraudulent or deceitful conduct and render claims inadmissible.1518 In application of these legal norms and considering the facts at issue, the counterclaims must also be held inadmissible.\n\nCM, paras. 921-923.\n\n**E.

Parties\u2019 positions**\n-------------------------\n\n1111.\n\nThe Claimants request that the Respondent pay the ICSID costs in the amount of USD 2,635,000, and their own legal fees and costs in the amount of USD 7,270,532.78, for a total amount of USD 9,905,532.78.1519\n\nMemorial, para. 431(xi); C-PHB1, para. 370(i); Claimants' Statement of Costs, para. 2; Claimants' comments on Respondent's Statement of Costs, paras. 13-14.\n\n1112.\n\nThe Respondent requests that the Claimants bear the entirety of arbitration costs and that they reimburse the Respondent's fees and expenses.1520 The Respondent incurred legal fees in the amount of USD 6,512,020.39 (including a success fee of USD 1,302,404.08), expenses in the amount of USD 170,005.77, in addition to advances for ICSID fees in the amount of USD 927,500, for a total amount of USD 7,609,526.16.1521\n\nCM, para. 1167, items 8-9; Rejoinder, para. 1096, item 4, bullet points 3 and 4; R-PHB1, para. 633, item 4, bullet points 3 and 4.\n\nRespondent's Statement of Costs, section IV.\n\n1113.\n\nThe Claimants argue that the Respondent is not entitled to a success fee, since such success fees do not qualify as reasonable costs incurred in the arbitration under Article 28 of the Arbitration Rules.1522 According to them, Guinea took the risk to pay the success fee and this risk should not be shifted to the Claimants.1523 At any rate, the Claimants submit that the amount of the success fee is unreasonable.1524 Finally, the Claimants note that Guinea should at least have disclosed the basis for its claim and the content of the private fee arrangement.1525\n\nClaimants' comments on Respondent's Statement of Costs, para. 4.\n\nClaimants' comments on Respondent's Statement of Costs, para. 6.\n\nClaimants' comments on Respondent's Statement of Costs, para. 9.\n\nClaimants' reply to Respondent's response to Claimants' comments on Respondent's Statement of Costs, para. 6.\n\n1114.\n\nThe Respondent explains that counsel accepted to charge a reduced rate of legal fees and that the success fee arrangement constituted an \"alternative fee arrangement\" destined to compensate counsel for non-billed fees.1526 The Respondent argues that success fees to offset a contingency fee arrangement are recoverable.1527 Finally, the Respondent argues that a 25% success fee is not unreasonable in the circumstances.1528\n\nRespondent's reply to Claimants' comments on Respondent's Statement of Costs, paras. 7-8.\n\nRespondent's reply to Claimants' comments on Respondent's Statement of Costs, para. 14.\n\nRespondent's reply to Claimants' comments on Respondent's Statement of Costs, paras. 18-19.\n\n**2. Discussion**\n-----------------\n\n1115.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n\"In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.\"\n\n1116.\n\nArticle 28(2) of the Arbitration Rules provides in relevant part that:\n\n\"Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding [\u2026].\"\n\n1117.\n\nArticle 47(1) of the Arbitration Rules provides that the Award \"shall contain [...] (j) any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding\".\n\n1118.\n\nIt is uncontroversial that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention grants the Tribunal discretion in allocating the ICSID arbitration costs and the Parties' costs, including legal fees.1529\n\nClaimants' comments on Respondent's Statement of Costs, paras. 6 and 15.\n\n1119.\n\nOverall, ICSID tribunals have followed two approaches to costs.1530 In the first approach, ICSID costs are apportioned in equal shares and each party bears its own costs, whereas in the second approach, the principle \"costs follow the event\" implies that the losing party bears the costs of the proceedings, including those of the other party, or that the parties bear the costs proportionately to their success or failure. In between these two approaches, solutions vary depending on the weight the Tribunal may place on various circumstances, including the conduct of the Parties in the arbitration and other parameters.\n\nSee, for instance, *Orascom TMT Investments S.\u00e0.r.l. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/12/35, Award, 31 May 2017, para. 583.\n\n1120.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to apply the \"costs follow the event\" principle. Accordingly, the following elements should guide the Tribunal's exercise of discretion. First, the Claimants prevailed on the jurisdictional objections in part and the counterclaims. The Tribunal notes in this context that the Parties did not spend significant time to plead these two issues. The Claimants' written submissions on jurisdictional objections amount to 22 pages out of more than 600 pages and the Respondent's submission amount to 20 pages out of more than 750 pages. Similarly, the Claimants' written submissions on the counterclaims amount to 16 pages and the Respondent's submissions amount to 32 pages. In addition, the Parties did not spend any significant time at the hearings to argue the jurisdictional objections and the counterclaims.\n\n1121.\n\nSecond, the Respondent prevailed on the claims, which have been deemed to be inadmissible in circumstances where the investors started this arbitration in respect of mining rights that have been obtained through corrupt practices. In other words, these proceedings should not have been brought in the first place.\n\n1122.\n\nIn addition, the Tribunal decided to appoint forensic experts to assess the authenticity of documents, which the Claimants had challenged and which were eventually not proven to be forged or otherwise not authentic. In these circumstances, the Tribunal believes that the costs incurred by the Respondent associated with the document authenticity must be borne by the Claimants.\n\n1123.\n\nThird, with respect to the success fees of the Respondent, counsel for the Respondent agreed to a cap of its fees in exchange for an alternative fee arrangement providing for a 25% success fee. Accordingly, contrary to the Claimants' assertion, the success fee does not qualify as a \"reward\" and does not appear unreasonable, since the total amount of legal fees of both Parties are nearly identical if the Respondent's success fees are taken into account. For these reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent is entitled to the success fees due to counsel.\n\n1124.\n\nHaving pondered all of these elements and exercising its discretion in matters of cost allocation, the Tribunal deems it appropriate that the Claimants bear 80% of the ICSID costs (see paragraphs 1126 and 1127 below), and 80% of the Respondent's costs incurred in these proceedings, i.e. USD 5,345,621.\n\n1125.\n\nThe Parties have paid the advances on costs requested by ICSID as follows:1531\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Date of call for funds** | **Amount requested, in USD** | **Amount received, in USD** | **Paid by Claimants, in USD** | **% of Amount Received** | **Paid by Respondent, in USD** | **% of Amount Received** |\n| 23-Feb-15 | 250,000 | 250,000 | 125,000 | 50.00% | 125,000 | 50.00% |\n| 17-Mar-16 | 300,000 | 300,000 | 225,000 | 75.00% | 75,000 | 25.00% |\n| 15-Mar-17 | 570,000 | 570,000 | 427,500 | 75.00% | 142,500 | 25.00% |\n| 31-Aug-17 | 40,000 | 40,000 | 30,000 | 75.00% | 10,000 | 25.00% |\n| 10-Oct-17 | 450,000 | 450,000 | 225,000 | 50.00% | 225,000 | 50.00% |\n| 9-Mar-18 | 300,000 | 300,000 | 150,000 | 50.00% | 150,000 | 50.00% |\n| 10-Sep-18 | 400,000 | 225,000 | 225,000 | 100.00% | 0 | 0.00% |\n| **SUB-TOTAL** | **2,310,000** | **2,135,000** | **1,407,500** | **65.93%** | **727,500** | **34.07%** |\n| Investment Income |  | 9,286.58 | 6,122.18 | 65.93% | 3,164.40 | 34.07% |\n| **TOTAL** |  | **2,144,286.58** | **1,413,622** | **65.93%** | **730,664** | **34.07%** |\n\nBecause the last advance on costs was not paid in full, the investment income yielded by the Parties' respective contributions has been collected and allocated to the ICSID annual administrative fee, and is therefore considered to be part of the Parties' contributions.\n\n1126.\n\nThe ICSID costs, detailed below, include (i) the fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the Tribunal\u2019s Assistant; (ii) the fees and expenses of the Tribunal-appointed Experts; (iii) payments made by ICSID for other expenses, such as those related to the document inspection and the hearings (catering, court reporters, interpreters, etc.); and (iv) ICSID\u2019s administrative fees.\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| Arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses |\n| Prof. Kaufmann-Kohler | USD 437,473.89 |\n| Prof. van den Berg | USD 292,290.29 |\n| Prof. Mayer | USD 228,757.50 |\n| Dr. Langer\u2019s fees and expenses | USD 238,391.33 |\n| Tribunal-appointed Experts\u2019 fees and expenses | USD 414,279.18 |\n| ICSID\u2019s administrative fees | USD 191,941.13 |\n| Direct expenses (estimated)1532 | USD 341,153.26 |\n| **Total** | **USD 2,144,286.58** |\n\nThis amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (courier, printing and copying).\n\n1127.\n\nThe Claimants have paid, through their contributions during the proceeding, 65.93% of the ICSID costs. In accordance with the cost allocation decided by the Tribunal in paragraph 1124 above (Claimants shall bear 80% of the ICSID costs), the Claimants must therefore pay a further 14.07% of the ICSID costs to the Respondent, i.e. USD 301,807.\n\n1128.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that, as the Parties have not paid in full the last advance on costs and no further advance on costs was issued during the stay of the proceeding or since the proceeding has resumed,1533 ICSID has not been able to collect all administrative fees due in this proceeding, resulting in a shortfall for the Centre of USD 114,058.87. The same is true for the Arbitrators and the Tribunal's Assistant who have not been able, for lack of available funds, to request payment of the entirety of their fees. Professor Kaufmann-Kohler has not claimed payment of 79.5 hours; Professor van den Berg has not claimed payment of 45 hours; Professor Mayer has not claimed payment of 12 hours; and Dr. Langer has not claimed payment of 65.25 hours. ICSID will provide the Parties with a final account statement.\n\n*See* paragraphs 127, 129-131, 136-137, 146,162, 167, 169 above.\n\n**VII.TRANSPARENCY**\n--------------------\n\n1129.\n\nIn conformity with the Parties' consent to the publication of the award (paragraph 24.1 of PO1), the transparency regime set out in PO2, and to paragraph 12(iii)(1) of PO2, the award shall be made available to the public. The Parties may therefore notify the Tribunal within 21 days from the issuance of the award whether they seek protection for confidential or protected information pursuant to paragraph 15 of PO2 and section C(c) of PO4. The other Party may then reply within two weeks and the Tribunal will rule thereafter.\n\n1130.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal will remain in office until it has resolved any transparency objections that either Party may raise.\n\n1131.\n\nFinally, the video recordings of the hearings and all documents referred to in Section 12(iii) of PO2 will, upon completion of the case, continue to be made available to the public on the ICSID website in conformity with paragraph 17(vi) of PO2.\n\n**VIII. OPERATIVE PART**\n------------------------\n\n1132.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal renders the following decision:\n\n(1) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims asserted under the Guinean Investment Code;\n\n(2) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the claims asserted by BSGR Guinea and BSGR Guernsey under the Base Convention;\n\n(3) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims asserted by BSGR under the Base Convention;\n\n(4) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the claims asserted under the Guinean Mining Code and the BOT Act;\n\n(5) The claims are inadmissible;\n\n(6) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the counterclaims asserted by the Respondent;\n\n(7) The counterclaims are inadmissible;\n\n(8) The Claimants shall bear 80% of the ICSID costs (fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and the Tribunal-appointed Experts as well as ICSID's administrative fees and direct expenses) and thus pay to the Respondent USD 301,807;\n\n(9) The Claimants shall bear 80% of the costs incurred by the Respondent in connection with these proceedings and thus pay to the Respondent USD 5,345,621;\n\n(10) All other claims and requests are dismissed.\n\n(11) Within 21 days from the filing of the Award, each Party may notify the Tribunal whether it seeks protection for confidential or protected information pursuant to paragraph 15 of PO2, after which the other Party may reply within 14 days. The Tribunal will remain in office until it has resolved the transparency objections, if any.\n\nDate: 18 May 2022"}]}
