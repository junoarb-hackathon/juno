INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Claimant is Mr. Peter A. Allard, a retired attorney and businessman (\"Mr. Allard\" or \"Claimant\") with Canadian nationality, represented in this arbitration by Mr. Robert Wisner and Mr. Jeffrey Levine of McMillan LLP, Barristers and Solicitors, Brookfield Place, Suite 4400, Bay Wellington Tower, 181 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5J 2T3, Canada, and by Mr. M. Tariq Khan of Khan Chambers, Chancery House, Bridgetown, Barbados.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent in this arbitration is the Government of Barbados (\"Barbados\" or \"Respondent\"), represented in this arbitration by Mr. Robert Volterra, Mr. Graham Coop, Mr. Bernhard Maier, and Ms. Jessica Pineda of Volterra Fietta, 1 Fitzroy Square, London W1T 5HE, England.\n\n3.\n\nThe claims arise under the Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Barbados for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 29 May 1996 (the \"BIT\")1 concerning Mr. Allard's investment of C$18.8 million in the acquisition and development of an eco-tourism site in Barbados (\"Sanctuary\").2 The claims are that the Respondent has \"failed to take reasonable and necessary environmental protection measures and, through its organs and agents, has directly contributed to the contamination of the Claimant's eco-tourism site, thereby destroying the value of his investment\",3 and that these \"actions and omissions violate Barbados' international obligations to Canadian investors\"4 under the BIT.\n\nThe Canada-Barbados BIT entered into force on 17 January 1997; Exhibit C-1.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 153.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 2.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6 2.\n\n4.\n\nArticle XIII of the BIT provides:\n\n(1) Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall, to the extent possible, be settled amicably between them.\n\n(2) If a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted by the investor to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). For the purposes of this paragraph, a dispute is considered to be initiated when the investor of one Contracting Party has delivered notice in writing to the other Contracting Party alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n[...]\n\n(4) The dispute may, at the election of the investor concerned, be submitted to arbitration under:\n\n[\u2026]\n\n(c) an international arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 21 May 2010, the Claimant delivered a Notice of Arbitration to the Respondent pursuant to Article XIII(4)(c) of the BIT and invoking the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as adopted in 1976 (\"UNCITRAL Rules\").\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant appointed Professor Andrew Newcombe as arbitrator on 24 November 2011. The Respondent appointed Professor W. Michael Reisman as arbitrator on 5 January 2012. Dr. Gavan Griffith QC was appointed Presiding Arbitrator on 14 March 2012.\n\n7.\n\nOn 22 May 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties signed Terms of Appointment, which, among other matters, designated the Permanent Court of Arbitration (the \"PCA\") as registry for the proceedings.\n\n8.\n\nFollowing a procedural hearing convened in New York on 7 June 2012, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 1 dated 26 June 2012.\n\n9.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, the Claimant filed his Statement of Claim followed by the exchange of pleadings between the Parties.\n\n10.\n\nOn 24 May 2013, the Respondent requested bifurcation of the proceedings to determine three jurisdictional objections (\"the objections\").\n\n11.\n\nFollowing exchanges of submissions between the Parties, on 10 June 2013 the Tribunal granted the Respondent's request for bifurcation and the preliminary determination of the objections. Thereafter pleadings were exchanged on the objections issues as follows:\n\n7 November 2013, Respondent's Counter-Memorial  \n12 September 2013, Claimant's Memorial  \n3 January 2014, Claimant's Reply  \n3 February 2014, Respondent's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction\n\n12.\n\nBetween 16 December 2013 and 13 January 2014, the Tribunal made orders in respect of the production to, and inspection by, the Respondent and its forensic experts of documents, including share certificates, requested of the Claimant by the Respondent.\n\n13.\n\nAn exchange of forensic experts' reports on 31 January 2014 was followed by the experts' joint-report filed 6 February 2014.\n\n14.\n\nHearings on the objections were held in New York over the period 18 to 21 February 2014.\n\n15.\n\nThe Parties were represented as follows:\n\nClaimant   \nRobert Wisner  \nJeffrey Levine  \n*McMillan LLP*\n\nTariq Khan  \n*Khan Chambers*\n\nRespondent   \nRobert Volterra  \nGraham Coop  \nBernhard Maier  \nJessica Pineda  \n*Volterra Fietta*\n\nAdriel Brathwaite QC  \n*Attorney General and Minister of Home Affairs, Government of Barbados*\n\nCorlita Babb-Schaefer  \n*Principal Crown Counsel, Attorney General's Chambers, Barbados*\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n16.\n\nThis part briefly summarizes the facts and contentions of the Parties on the objections. However, in making this determination, the Tribunal has had regard to the entirety of the pleadings, documents, exhibits, transcripts, submissions, citations of law and decisions made by and between the Parties.\n\n17.\n\nIn October 1996, the Claimant incorporated a Barbadian company, Graeme Hall Bird Sanctuary Inc., later renamed Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Inc. (\"GHNSI\"),5 to acquire 34.24 acres of wetlands to establish a bird sanctuary and nature reserve, within some 240 acres of wetlands and open space that comprised the former Graeme Hall Plantation on the south coast of Barbados.6\n\nAllard Statement, \u00b6 8.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 9; Allard Statement, \u00b6 7; Certificate of Incorporation, Exhibit C-9.\n\n18.\n\nThe chain of ownership of the Sanctuary is a disputed fact in these proceedings. The Claimant claims ownership within the terms of the BIT in the circumstances he was, and remains, the President and a director of GHNSI7 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Graeme Hall (B.V.I.), (\"GHBVI\"), a British Virgin Islands company incorporated in 1996, and of which the Claimant was, and remains, the sole shareholder, President, and a director.8\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 11.\n\nGHBVI Certificate of Incorporation, dated 18 October 1996, Exhibit C-126.\n\n19.\n\nAlthough the Barbados 1986 National Development Plan had designated a \"buffer zone\" around the perimeter of the Sanctuary for recreational and agricultural use, in 2003 the Respondent issued a proposed Amended Plan (the 2003 Plan) proposing the division of the buffer zone by designating the area adjacent to the Sanctuary for predominantly residential use and the outer area as an urban corridor.\n\n20.\n\nIn 2007, the 2003 Plan was enacted by the Barbadian Parliament to come into force on 15 April 2008.9\n\nStatutory Instruments Supplement No. 14, Supplement to Official Gazette No. 31 dated 7 April 2008, Exhibit C-76.\n\n21.\n\nA sluice gate located at the end of the canal that bisects the Graeme Hall wetlands was long intended both to regulate water levels and to control the exchange of water to and from the sea.10 It is common ground that in the event the sluice gate is closed or inoperable the regulation of water levels and tidal flow in and out of the wetlands and the sea is inhibited and the integrity of the Sanctuary is thereby liable to be adversely affected.\n\nHeaslet Statement, \u00b6 10.\n\n22.\n\nEnvironmental drainage issues arising from the inappropriate operation of the sluice gate were known to the Parties before the opening of the Sanctuary,11 and were noted in the Claimant's 1999 Environmental Management Plan (\"EMP\") and Amended EMP in 2000.12 Indeed, the Claimant was required to submit an Amended EMP to address in greater detail the potential drainage issues.13\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 39-40; Graeme Hall Bird Sanctuary Environmental Management Plan, Exhibit C-43; Amended Graeme Hall Bird Sanctuary Environmental Management Plan dated April 2000, Exhibit C-44; Witness Statement of Mr. Mark Cummins dated 13 June 2013, \u00b6 25.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 41.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Mark Cummins dated 13 June 2013, \u00b6 25.\n\n23.\n\nIn 2005, a failure at the South Coast Sewerage Treatment Plant operated by the Barbados Water Authority resulted in a discharge of raw sewage that seriously contaminated the Sanctuary.14 According to the Claimant, the negative effects of this pollution were exacerbated by the sluice gate not preventing water flow between the swamp and the sea.15 Tests conducted by GHNSI's experts at the time confirmed heavy bacterial growths in the water leading to stresses to the ecological systems of the wetlands.16\n\nMaster Plan for the Graeme Hall Ecosystem authored by the Coastal Zone Management Unit in the Ministry of Energy and the Environment, September 2007, Chapter 3, Exhibit C-72, p. 2.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 72-74.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 71.\n\n24.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that such events and functions concerning drainage issues and deficiencies in the operations of the sluice gate led to the serious degradation of the water and swamp areas within the Sanctuary. This, together with the elimination of the buffer zone under the 2003 Plan, especially upon its implementation, has both caused and aggravated continuing damage to the Sanctuary's environment and operations to the point of its destruction as a viable environmental facility. These developments and events collectively led to the postponement of completion of a visitors' centre adjacent to the Sanctuary and also to other consequential damages to the Sanctuary project to the extent that by June 2007 the Claimant contemplated abandoning the Sanctuary as a viable environmental facility, and explored the possibility of a sale of the Sanctuary.17 As no sale eventuated, the Claimant thereafter decided to permanently close the Sanctuary on 29 October 2008.18\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 86-88; Sales advertisement dated 5 June 2007, and email correspondence from S. Heaslet to the International Herald Tribune dated 5 June 2007, Exhibit C-77; Allard Statement, \u00b6 67.\n\nGHNSI Press Release dated 29 October 2008, Exhibit C-78.\n\n25.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant claims that the Respondent's actions and omissions as particularized in his memorials and evidence breached the Respondent's explicit obligations under Article XIII of the BIT:\n\n(1) to provide fair and equitable treatment;\n\n(2) to provide full protection and security; and\n\n(3) not to expropriate an investment without compensation.\n\nFurther, the Claimant claims that the Respondent violated a principle of customary international law prohibiting a host country from permitting the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury to the property of a foreign investor.\n\n26.\n\nApart from Article XIII issues for dispute in the merits phase, a principal provision of the BIT for consideration or objection is Article I(f) and its definition of an \"investment\" for purposes of protection under the substantive sections of the BIT defining \"investment\" as:\n\nany kind of asset owned or controlled either directly, or indirectly through an investor of a third State, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter's laws and, in particular, though not exclusively, includes:\n\ni. movable and immovable property and any related property rights, such as mortgages, liens or pledges;\n\nii. shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of participation in a company, business enterprise or joint venture;\n\niii. money, claims to money, and claims to performance under contract having a financial value;\n\niv. goodwill;\n\nv. intellectual property rights;\n\nvi. rights, conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any economic and commercial activity, including any rights to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.\n\nbut does not mean real estate or other property, tangible or intangible, not acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes.19\n\nArticle XIII(3) of the BIT, also provides for a limitation period:\n\nAn investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:\n\n[...]\n\n(d) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.20\n\nCanada-Barbados BIT, Exhibit C-1.\n\nCanada-Barbados BIT, Exhibit C-1.\n\n**IV. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS AND RELIEF REQUESTED**\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent requests as a dispositive award that the Tribunal:\n\n(1) Declare that the Claimant has failed to prove his ownership or control of the Sanctuary at any relevant date and that the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction *ratione personae* and *ratione materiae;*\n\n(2) Declare that the Claimant did not acquire the Sanctuary in the expectation or use it for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes and that the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction *ratione materiae* ; and\n\n(3) Declare that the Claimant's claims in relation to the Respondent's purported breaches of the BIT fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* because at the date when these proceedings were initiated (21 May 2010), more than three years had elapsed after the Claimant first acquired or should have acquired knowledge of the alleged breaches (and any consequential loss or damage) on which these claims are based;\n\nwith final orders for dismissal of the claim, with costs.21\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 112; Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 107.\n\n28.\n\nIn answer, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal issue an award rejecting the Respondent's objections, with costs, to be followed by the merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n29.\n\nAs the Parties accept that apart from compliance with Article 1(f) the Claimant otherwise qualifies as an \"investor\", the objections for determination are:\n\n**(1) Whether the Sanctuary qualifies as an \"investment\" by the Claimant within Article** **1(f); and if so,**\n\n**(2) Whether at the relevant times the Claimant owned or controlled the investment in accordance with Article 1(f); and also**\n\n**(3) Whether the Claimant's claim is within time under Article XIII(3) of the BIT (set out in paragraph 26 above).**\n\n30.\n\nIn this determination of the objections the Tribunal accepts the general approach as to onus expressed by the *Phoenix Action* case, namely that \"if jurisdiction rests on the existence of certain facts, they have to be proven at the jurisdictional stage\", but, nonetheless, that where disputed facts are intermingled with merits issues, as a matter of discretion, the determination of contested jurisdictional objections, may be held over to the merits phase.22\n\nPhoenix Action v. Czech Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5, Award of 15 April 2009, \u00b6 61.\n\n**A. Objection (1): Whether the Sanctuary Qualifies as an \"Investment\"**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*The Respondent's arguments*\n----------------------------\n\n31.\n\nArticle 1(f) explicitly excludes the Sanctuary from the ambit of the BIT's protection, as the Claimant did not expect or intend to use, and did not use, the Sanctuary \"for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes\". Hence the Claimant's \"investment\" is excluded from the protections of the BIT, and the Tribunal has no jurisdiction *ratione materiae* over the Claimant's claim.23\n\nJurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 35.\n\n32.\n\nThe terms of the exclusion to Article 1(f), interpreted and applied in accordance with their ordinary meaning and context,24 require, *inter alia*, an element of profit and purpose,25 as is established by the expert report of Mr. Philip Haberman, an experienced accountant familiar with concepts of commercial profit.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 88.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 89-90, *referring to* Black's Law Dictionary 226 (9th ed. 2009), Exhibit RLA-24 and Third Expert Report of Mr. Haberman dated 6 November 2013.\n\n33.\n\nTo broaden the scope of the BIT to include not-for-profit ventures and not-for-profit enterprises \"artificially commingles the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione personae* with its jurisdiction *ratione materiae* \".26\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 83.\n\n34.\n\nContemporaneous statements by the Claimant and persons on his behalf repeatedly disclaim any motivation and purposes, original and continuing, by Mr. Allard to develop the Sanctuary for profit making or any other business purposes. Mr. Allard's motivations and intentions in this regard admittedly were exclusively altruistic for the non-commercial purposes of protecting and preserving the environment of the Sanctuary for public purposes.\n\n35.\n\nIn particular, the Respondent relies upon:27\n\n(1) A statement in the Claimant's Statement of Claim, that \"Mr. Allard believed that by purchasing a part of the wetlands, developing them to showcase their unique attributes and protecting the eco-system, he would be able to preserve an important part of the environmental heritage of Barbados\";28\n\n(2) A statement repeated in the Claimant's submissions, evidence, and expert reports, to the effect that \"[t]he purpose of [the Claimant's] investment was to create a financially self-sustaining enterprise that would be able to conserve the environmental heritage of Barbados in perpetuity\";29\n\n(3) A letter from the Claimant to the Respondent's former deputy prime minister, Dame Billie Miller, in which the Claimant stated: \"While I firmly believe that this project should be made to financially \u2018stand on its own feet' (i.e. sustainability), I want to assure the government that my prime motivation is the preservation of Graeme Hall as there are many daily opportunities for me to invest in projects with minimal risk, good security and government procedures already in place\";30\n\n(4) A letter from the Claimant to the Respondent's former prime minister, stating that the \"the nature of [GHNSI's] charitable and technical contributions to Government is by design\" and that \"[t]he conservation of Graeme Hall Swamp's historic and environmentally sensitive lands is fundamentally a nonprofit endeavor, and not consistent with high revenue tourism or other commercial activities\";31\n\n(5) A comment by Mr. Harry Roberts, the former general manager of GHNSI, admitting that money was not a consideration for the Sanctuary;32\n\n(6) An article by Mr. Heaslet suggesting that the Sanctuary had no interest in making money;33 and\n\n(7) An online video entitled \"Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary - Barbados,\" explaining that \"money earned from visitor operations helps pay for environmental management of the 30 acre wetland within the Sanctuary\".34\n\nOther cited statements include: (1) on one occasion, the Claimant proclaimed that he has \"great affection and regard for the people of Barbados, and the Sanctuary effort has always been a philanthropic mission\". Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Press Release \"Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary in Barbados to Close\" October 29, 2008, Exhibit C-78; (2) Mr. Heaslet, the Claimant's representative, in a newspaper article dated 1 July 2007 confirmed that: \"Philanthropically speaking, we respect the sovereign responsibility of Barbados for its environmental legacy, and generally disagree with those who seek to transfer the responsibility for preserving the Barbados environment to private, for-profit interests\". Heaslet, \"Profit not all that Matters\", 1 July 2007, *Sunday Sun*, Exhibit R-8; and (3) following an open day on 1 December 2008, the Claimant's general manager Harry Roberts told the Daily Nation newspaper explicitly that money was not a consideration: \"I am glad to see these high numbers [of visitors on the open day]. We saw close to 10 000 people passing through today, and money is not important. The fact that Barbadians can come here with their children and witness something extraordinary makes all the difference\". Aimey Phillippe, \"Thousands turn up at the Sanctuary again\", 2 December 2008, *Daily Nation*, Exhibit R-10.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 14. A similar statement cited by the Respondent reads: \"The motivation [for the Claimant's endeavors] is simple. Private investment combined with a conservation ethic can permanently preserve the last mangrove and sedge swamp on the island of Barbados and be supported by its international conservation, research and education facility\". Private Ownership Justification, essay authored by S. Heaslet, 26 January 2001, Exhibit C-64, cited in Jurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 42.\n\nJurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 43, *referring to* Notice of Dispute, 8 September 2009, \u00b6 7, Exhibit C-2; Expert Report of Howard N.

See also Letter from the Claimant to The Right Honourable David Thompson, dated 15 October 2008, p. 3, Exhibit R-7, in which the Claimant emphasized the Sanctuary's \"goal of self-sustainability\".\n\nLetter from Mr. Allard to the Hon. Billie Miller, 19 July 1995, Exhibit C-30.\n\nLetter from Mr. Allard to the Hon. Owen Arthur, 1 April 2005, p. 6, Exhibit R-11.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 33, *referring to* Supplemental Allard Statement, \u00b6 13.\n\nHeaslet, \"Profit not all that Matters\", 1 July 2007, *Sunday Sun*, Exhibit R-8.\n\nRejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 46, *referring to* Video entitled \"Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary - Barbados\" uploaded 17 September 2010, Exhibit R-26.\n\n36.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant has failed to establish that the Sanctuary project was established for anything other than for philanthropic or public benefit purposes related to the preservation of the environment;35 and most certainly not for the purpose of deriving an economic benefit to the requisite level of being directed to derive a commercial profit or for other business purposes.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 77-78.\n\n*The Claimant's arguments*\n--------------------------\n\n37.\n\nMr. Allard's investment in the Sanctuary project falls within the meaning of \"investment\" because:36\n\n(1) His business plans and financial projections for the Sanctuary contemplated (at least) a modest surplus;37\n\n(2) He expected that the Sanctuary would generate an economic return;38\n\n(3) The Sanctuary was registered as a for-profit business corporation; and\n\n(4) The Sanctuary in fact operated as a for-profit business.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61\n\nAllard Statement, \u00b6 18; GHNSI Amended Business Plan, 15 September 2003, Exhibit C-23; GHNSI Financial Projections for the year ending December 31, 2000, Exhibit C-22.

This is consistent with the BIT's objective of strengthening \"the development of economic cooperation\" between Canada and Barbados, including \"the promotion of sustainable development that is sensitive to environmental concerns\".39 Indeed, an investment in a nonprofit enterprise may fall within the scope of the BIT's protections.40\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 58-59; Claimant's Observations on Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 37-39; Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 135.\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 59; Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 135.\n\n39.\n\nFurther, as the exception has two limbs contrasting the purpose of \"economic benefit\" under the first with \"other business purpose\" under the second, the alternative of the second limb of the exception embracing \"business purposes\" includes objectives beyond mere economic benefit under the first limb.41\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 57.

A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.\n\n2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: (a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty; (b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.\n\n43.\n\nIn summary, it is for the Tribunal itself to construe the terms of Article 1(f) in accordance with their ordinary meaning within the context, and in the light, of the BIT's \"object and purpose.\"\n\n44.\n\nPlainly, the principal definitions of \"investment\" under Article 1(f) - \"any kind of asset\" - in their ordinary meaning suffice to include the Claimant's investment in the Sanctuary, both as to the real estate and also as to the cash advances made for the Sanctuary's operations, unless such matters fall within the final exception, namely if those assets were \" *not acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes* \".\n\n45.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, the Tribunal holds that the Claimant satisfies the criteria in (i) \"acquired in the expectation... of economic benefit\" and therefore the Claimant's assets do not fall within the exception in Article 1(f). Although the Claimant seemed to enjoy wearing the public mantle of a philanthropist, the preponderance of objective indicators shows clearly that he was not creating a not-for-profit corporation.\n\n46.\n\nIn making its determination whether assets were \"acquired in the expectation of economic benefit\", the reference point for the first element (the Claimant's expectations) remains subjective and personal to Mr. Allard's actual expectations and intentions as may be ascertained at the time of the acquisition of the investment. The enquiry is not whether this Tribunal, or some other rational investor, would, or may have been, of the same disposition in acquiring the asset. In contrast, the enquiry with respect to \"used\" focuses on the actual use of the asset and requires an objective enquiry into whether the assets in question were used for economic benefit or other business purposes.\n\n47.\n\nIn engaging in the analysis the Tribunal is not assisted by Mr. Haberman's views and opinions as to the meaning or content of economic benefit framed by reference to conventional risk/return analysis as reflected by Canadian bond rates or some other objective measures of financial return. It may be assumed that few, if any, Canadian investors would have been minded to invest offshore in Barbados in a \"soft\" venture such as that constituted by Mr. Allard establishing the Sanctuary in 1996. However, for his own reasons and motivations, Mr. Allard elected to do so, and the issue of characterization for determination by the Tribunal remains whether the peculiar corporate structure adopted for holding the assets falls within the definition of \"investment\" with Article 1(f), and is not excluded by the exception.\n\n48.\n\nAs to the general issue of onus: on one view, not advanced by the Parties, as an exclusion to the principal definitions, the Respondent carries the onus to establish that the exception applies. However, as in any event the Tribunal concludes that it is in a position to make a determinative finding, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to express a view on onus.\n\n49.\n\nOn balance, and despite the matters of first impression to the contrary arising from the Respondent's references to factual indicia, noted in paragraph 35 above, mostly sourced to the Claimant's own statements and materials, the conclusion of the Tribunal is that the funds for the purchase of the real estate constituting the Sanctuary, and thereafter making loans for its operations were made by Mr. Allard \"for the purpose of economic benefit\".\n\n50.\n\nIn this regard, it suffices for the Tribunal to refer to the following matters establishing this conclusion -\n\n(1) GHBSI was formed in 1996 as a for-profit corporation under Barbadian law.43\n\n(2) GHBVI was incorporated as a British Virgin Islands (\"BVI\") company at the same time to serve as a holding company, a common structure for foreign investors to limit their tax exposures in their home jurisdiction.44 This structure would be unnecessary were the venture intended to be non-profit-making.\n\n(3) The letter from the Claimant to the Barbados Minister of Finance dated 26 February 1996, requests a waiver of tax on dividends (and also tax exemptions).45\n\n(4) The Claimant's successive business plans from 1998 contemplated an emerging surplus and even repayment of capital advances, albeit with a low rate of return.46\n\n(5) The Claimant's later offers to transfer as a gift part of the Sanctuary lands, but to retain the commercial and income generating parts,47 presumably was intended to retain future income.\n\n(6) The Claimant's unchallenged statements in evidence that he had an expectation of getting his money back:\n\nPRESIDENT GRIFFITH: Mr. Allard, as I understand your evidence, you intended that you should derive income to provide for operating expenses going forward; is that right?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir. And then some.\n\nPRESIDENT GRIFFITH: And then do I understand that you intended any surplus income will be put into reserves to enable the long-range operation of the Sanctuary when it became as you referred to somewhere an endeavour of your estate?\n\nTHE WITNESS: To improve--to improve the asset, yes.\n\nPRESIDENT GRIFFITH: Yes. Now, did you intend that you would be, as part of that process of generating return, be repaid all or any part of the 35 million you referred to in Paragraph 3 of this letter?\n\nTHE WITNESS: That I intend to be part of it?\n\nPRESIDENT GRIFFITH: Did you intend to get your money back?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Over time, yes.48\n\nFollowed by an exchange with the Respondent's counsel:\n\nIs it your testimony that you cannot be self-sustaining without having more money come in than goes out?\"\n\nYour answer was: \"Well, your self-sustainment has to be involved in a business that has to involve reserves and monies coming forward for the next year.\" I questioned: \"Those are revenues, though, isn't it? Not profit. Selfsustaining doesn't require profit, does it?\" So, my question to you is: Are you not talking about revenue and instead of profit and that self-sustaining might require revenues meeting expenditures, even possibly capital reserves, but it doesn't require a profit per se to be self-sustaining? That's my question.\n\nA. Not per se, but that was--that was our goal, was profit.49\n\nAllard Statement, \u00b6 8; Certificate of Incorporation, Exhibit C-9.\n\nHearing transcript, p. 213, line 25 - p. 214, line 12.\n\nLetter from Joseph Ward to the Right Hon.

Notwithstanding that the Tribunal might not be inclined to have formed the same expectations as to future profit or repayments of investments, the contemporaneous indicia are sufficiently confirmed by Mr. Allard's evidence to the Tribunal, as to what were his intentions at that time. However unreasonable it may now appear to the Tribunal following the failure of the Sanctuary project, the Tribunal accepts that those expectations of an eventual profit were honestly held by Mr. Allard when establishing the Sanctuary in 1996 and thereafter, notwithstanding that during the Sanctuary's establishment and operations factors of profit were considered secondary and in the background to his principal motivations of environmental and public purposes.\n\n52.\n\nThe BIT does not require any quantification of economic benefit, let alone one measured against an estimate of a rational return as may be sought by a disinterested investor. Mr. Allard was a committed environmentalist.50 It suffices to find that the exception to Article 1(f) is not made because the Claimant's contemporaneous expectations were, and remained, that in the long run the Sanctuary would pay a return on, or even eventually repay, the monies committed for the Sanctuary project. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant acquired the Sanctuary \"in the expectation... of economic benefit\". In light of this determination, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to determine whether the Sanctuary was actually used for the purpose of economic benefit during its operations. Further, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to determine the meaning of \"other business purpose\" and whether such purpose requires profit-making over and above the making of revenues to allow operations to be self-sustaining.\n\nAllard Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n\n**B. Objection (2): Whether the Claimant Owns the Sanctuary in Accordance with the Laws of Barbados**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Respondent raises two issues, namely that:\n\n(1) The Claimant has not established that he owns GHNSI (and the Sanctuary) through GHBVI; and\n\n(2) The Claimant does not own GHNSI through GHBVI \"in accordance with Barbadian law\".\n\nThis second issue raises also significant issues of non-compliance with Barbados exchange control laws.\n\n*Issue 1: The Respondent's arguments*\n-------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nThe Claimant has not established that he owns the Sanctuary, directly or indirectly, in accordance with Article 1(f). There are many inconsistencies in the Claimant's documents and evidence, individually and taken together, to support adverse findings of proof of the Claimant's purported corporate ownership chain through GHNSI and GHBVI.\n\n54.\n\nThe authenticity of the share certificate in GHNSI dated 17 October 1996 submitted by the Claimant with his Statement of Claim (the \"first certificate\") as proof to substantiate GHBVI's ownership of GHNSI is challenged. The first certificate bears only the Claimant's signature as \"Director\" with a blank space for the Secretary's signature and also is unsealed.51 And, as GHNSI was not incorporated until 18 October 1996, one day after the date of the first certificate, GHNSI could not have issued any shares to GHBVI on the day prior to its incorporation.52 Further, the name change to GHNSI took place only five years later on December 18, 2001.53 The first certificate should be rejected as \"a fraudulent concoction conjured up *ex post facto* by the Claimant to manufacture the Tribunal's jurisdiction where it would not otherwise have existed\".54\n\nJurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 33, citing By-Law No. 1 of Graeme Hall Bird Sanctuary Inc. enacted October 17, 1996, Exhibit C-139.\n\nJurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 25.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 11. The Claimant's witness, Mr. Trevor Carmichael admits that \"[t]here is a discrepancy in name undoubtedly\"; Witness Statement of Mr. Carmichael QC dated 10 September 2013, \u00b6 12.\n\nJurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 24.\n\n55.\n\nThe later share certificate submitted with the Claimant's Memorial on Jurisdiction (the \"second certificate\") both sealed and bearing the Secretary's signatures, and otherwise identical to the first certificate, also excites suspicion of recent concoction. The correspondence between the Parties and the witness statement of Sir Trevor Carmichael support inferences and conclusions that Sir Trevor signed the completed the second certificate only after the deficiencies of the first certificate were exposed in the pleadings.55\n\nSee, e.g., Carmichael Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.\n\n56.\n\nIt is inconsequential that Barbadian laws allow pre-incorporation agreements in written contracts entered into by a person in the name of or on behalf of a company to be incorporated, as the share certificates do not constitute a written contract and do not qualify for this exception.56\n\nMemorial on Jurisdiction, paragraph 10, relying on Section 16 of the Companies Act CAP 308 of the Laws of Barbados, Exhibit C-131.\n\n57.\n\nThe issues adverse to the validity and effect of the share certificates are not merely \"technical issues... of no import\".57 The Claimant has used the corporate names GHNSI and GHBSI \"completely interchangeably\"58 and, at the least, has failed to adduce credible evidence of his indirect ownership or control of either company.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 56, citing Memorial on Jurisdiction, Heading I.C and \u00b6 48.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 49.\n\n58.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant's production of the two share certificates and of other documentation and evidence and explanations falls short of proof of ownership. As Sir Trevor Carmichael conceded, it is possible there was never any issue or transfer of shares in 1996 as is now sought to be evidenced by the first certificate.59 The record suggests that the Claimant did not decide until 2005 to constitute GHBVI as the sole shareholder of GHNSI, and only then constructed the ownership documents of retrospective effect. At the least, the chain of ownership is not established.\n\nHearing transcript, p. 479, line 21 - p. 481, line 19.\n\n*Issue 1: The Claimant's arguments*\n-----------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe Sanctuary is an investment owned or controlled by Mr. Allard through the corporate chain of:\n\n(1) GHNSI having bought and taken transfer title to the lands of the Sanctuary;\n\n(2) as a wholly-owned subsidiary of GHBVI; and\n\n(3) of which the Claimant is the owner.\n\n60.\n\nAny inconsistencies in the name of GHBVI (Limited or Inc.) are inconsequential. The description and title Limited and Inc. are inter-changeable when referring to a British Virgin Islands' corporate entity.60\n\nClaimant's Observations on Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 18, referring to Request, \u00b6 21; Share Certificate of GHNSI, Exhibit C-11.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant has presented contemporaneous evidence from the original incorporations in 1996 comprising: GHBSI's Certificate of Incorporation, 16 October 1996; GHBVI's Certificate of Incorporation, 18 October 1996; and also GHBVI list of directors (including the Claimant), and GHBVI's Share Certificate, issuing shares to the Claimant, both dated 23 October 1996.61\n\nClaimant's Opening Statement at the Hearing, presentation slide 4.\n\n62.\n\nThat GHBVI had not been incorporated when GHNSI issued the first certificate is inconsequential. The formal requirements concerning validation of pre-incorporation contracts do not vitiate the unchallenged circumstances of share issuance and sole ownership, where, as here, none of the parties to the investment takes any issue as to the invalidity of deficiencies in form. In any event, the laws of the British Virgin Islands apply to determine GHBVI's contractual rights, and these laws recognize that a BVI company may elect to adopt any preincorporation transactions within a reasonable time after its incorporation.62\n\nSection 69 of the International Business Companies Act CAP 291 of the Laws of the British Virgin Islands, Exhibit C-132.\n\n63.\n\nThe second certificate is *prima facie* evidence of GHBVI's title to GHNSI's shares under Barbadian law. In the absence of any rebutting evidence, GHBVI's legal ownership, and Mr. Allard's indirect ownership, of the investment in GHNSI is established. Other filed documents and direct evidence of witnesses, including Mr. Allard himself, also confirm Mr. Allard's indirect ownership of GHNSI.63\n\nSee, e.g., Allard Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 6-9; Allard Supplemental Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 5-11.\n\n64.\n\nAs the BIT allows an investor to bring a claim based on either \"ownership\" or \"control\" of an investment, the Claimant's legal \"ownership\" of GHNSI is not determinative to jurisdiction.\n\n65.\n\nHere there is no challenge to Mr. Allard's control of the company. No entity except GHNSI and GHBVI has ever claimed any interest in the Sanctuary. It is Mr. Allard who has funded the acquisition and the development and operations of the Sanctuary and conducted its affairs through these corporate entities, and who is the \"owner\" of the investments.\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimant's cash advances for the Sanctuary's development and operations are proven by the bank statements and the witness statement of the Claimant's assistant and bookkeeper. The making of these loans by Mr. Allard directly to the Sanctuary project are unchallenged.\n\n*Issue 2: The Respondent's arguments*\n-------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nUnder Section 13.2 of the 1984 (Barbados) Companies Regulations, a share certificate must be co-signed by the secretary or an assistant secretary holding office at the time of signing. As the first certificate does not contain such a signature and is not sealed by the company it was not issued in accordance with Barbadian laws and is invalid.\n\n68.\n\nThe expert evidence of Mr. Griffith establishes that the second certificate also is invalid under Barbadian law because it issued in the name of a company which did not exist at the time of the alleged signature; it is signed by a person who did not hold the office of secretary at the time of signature; and it does not comply with the requisite formalities for the issuance of a replacement certificate.\n\n69.\n\nIn addition, Mr. Griffith's evidence establishes that the undated shareholders' resolution (appointing Sir Trevor Carmichael to the Board of GHNSI) cannot serve as evidence of share ownership under Barbadian law. Under Barbadian law, the production of a resolution by the board such as that submitted by the Claimant cannot stand on its own as evidence of share ownership.64\n\nFirst Legal Expert Opinion of Mr. Michael Griffith dated 6 November 2013, \u00b6 10.\n\n70.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that under the 1976 Exchange Control Act, a Barbadian person or entity may not issue any security to a non-Barbadian person or entity without seeking the prior approval of the Exchange Control Authority of Barbados (the \"Exchange Control Authority\" or \"ECA\"). Any such transaction performed without the Exchange Control Authority's prior approval is void.65 The Respondent draws the Tribunal's attention to Sir Trevor Carmichael's admission at the hearing that ECA approval is necessary.66 Since the Claimant has failed to provide any evidence that any issuance of shares in GHNSI to GHBVI was approved by the Exchange Control Authority, any such transfer was void under Barbadian law.67 Consequently, the Claimant has failed to prove that he owned or controlled an investment in the territory of the Respondent in accordance with the Respondent's laws.68\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 53, *referring to* First Legal Expert Opinion of Mr. Michael Griffith dated 6 November 2013, Section I.\n\nHearing transcript, p. 471, lines 13-18.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 54. See also Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 31-32.\n\nCounter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 55.\n\n*Issue 2: The Claimant's arguments*\n-----------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nThe Respondent does not prove any Barbadian law that establishes a mandatory requirement that a particular form be used let alone that to be valid a share certificate has to be sealed.69\n\nClaimant's Observations on Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28.\n\n72.\n\nThe second certificate bearing the signatures of Mr. Allard as the sole director, Sir Trevor Carmichael as secretary, and sealed by the company is complete and regular, and suffices to prove ownership. There is no regulatory requirement that a lost, or assumed lost, share certificate be formally cancelled.\n\n73.\n\nIn any event, the first and second certificates essentially are the same document, with additions to the second certificate made as part of routine regularization of corporate records, a practice consistent with the relevant corporate laws and practice in Barbados.\n\n74.\n\nThe fact that some of the documents underlying the investment contain technical deficiencies in form with the respect to an investment plainly made by Mr. Allard, and no other person, is not a ground to exclude his investment from protection as unproven. Technical issues with respect to the documentation supporting Mr. Allard's ownership or control of the Sanctuary are inconsequential and not decisive.\n\n75.\n\nIt is the Claimant's position that non-compliance with the Exchange Control Act of Barbados does not void ownership. According to the Claimant, section 11 of the Exchange Control Act does not provide, as the Respondent contends, that securities issued without permission of the proper authority are void *ab initio*. Rather, this provision serves to ensure that foreign investment records are kept.70 None of the cases relied upon by the Respondent were decided by a Barbadian court. The Claimant argues that as a matter of international law, the Respondent must show that the Claimant has breached a fundamental principle of Barbadian law to render the rights of ownership void *ab initio*, which it has not done. Finally, the Respondent's argument based on the Exchange Control Act is untimely in the Claimant's view, according to Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Rules, which requires that jurisdictional objections be raised no later than the filing of the Statement of Defense.71\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 87-88\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 99-104.\n\n*The Tribunal's findings on issues 1 and 2*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n*Issue 1: Ownership*\n--------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent challenges both the authenticity of the documents presented by the Claimant to substantiate his ownership as well as their effectiveness.\n\n77.\n\nIn this regard, the Parties contest what the Claimant has to establish to prove ownership. The Claimant asserts that it is sufficient for him to make a *prima facie* showing in relation to his ownership of the shares in GHBVI, and, through it, of GHNSI. In contrast, the Respondent demands strict and convincing proofs of legal ownership under Barbadian corporation laws and regulations.\n\n78.\n\nAdmittedly, there is very little contemporaneous evidence from 1996 to substantiate the chain of certified share ownership under the first certificate. In particular, there is no documentary record to confirm the assumptions made, or the process by which Sir Trevor's staff reconstructed the corporate documents during 2005 and 2006. Sir Trevor has no personal knowledge. Moreover, the documents produced, explained as intended to replace certificates and records assumed to have been in existence, but lost, are not at all consistent (e.g., they used the name of a company, GHNSI, that did not exist at the time).\n\n79.\n\nThe explanations given by Sir Trevor are limited to surmise and conjecture that there was complete original documentation that had been mislaid. There is no evidence to establish these facts. Sir Trevor explained that, under the somewhat loose standards of corporate compliance and practice in Barbados, it is common enough for corporate custodians, such as his firm, to remedy retrospectively emerging deficiencies, particularly where, as here, a sole shareholder and owner undoubtedly is the proprietor and owner of corporate entities.72\n\nCarmichael Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.\n\n80.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that much of the corporate documentary history remains conflicting and based on mere assumptions of prior regularity and assumed gap-filling. The records of corporate structure, the issuance of shares, and for the constitution of the board of directors and of shareholders are incomplete. It is unlikely that any board meetings were convened beyond the circulation of purported minutes. And the evidence and explanations of Sir Trevor comprise a loose amalgam of assumption as to what had, or, as more likely, should have, occurred in the two attorneys' offices to put corporate records, including share certificates, into order.\n\n81.\n\nNonetheless, in the Tribunal's opinion, the Claimant's stated intentions and the evidence of actions taken by Mr. Allard's attorneys go to confirm the direct links between the two corporate entities and Mr. Allard's ultimate ownership. The only asset of GHBVI was its ownership of GHNSI, as a shell BVI company, created as the holding company for the Sanctuary, as a tax efficient vehicle for the Claimant to make his investment in the Sanctuary project.\n\n82.\n\nAt the least, there is no reason to find that the first or second share certificates are fraudulent or have been deliberately withheld from the Tribunal, or that the replacement copies were created in anticipation of this arbitration.\n\n83.\n\nAs noted above, the Tribunal also accepts the Claimant's argument in the alternative that even if the Tribunal were to find that the contemporaneous documents to fall short of demonstrating ownership from 1996, the Claimant undoubtedly owned the Sanctuary through his shareholding in GHBVI by 2005 when the corporate documents were regularized.\n\n84.\n\nAlthough it was contended by the Respondent before the Tribunal that under Barbadian law, upon a company's incorporation, no shares need to be issued for the company lawfully to exist,73 as a matter of principle the Tribunal cannot accept that, under either Barbadian or BVI laws, a private company may exist as an ownerless entity. Here, the Tribunal does not have any evidence as to the issuance or transfer of subscriber's shares, but in the absence of evidence to the contrary the Tribunal concludes that GHBVI was the owner of the shares of GHNSI or, at least, was entitled to call for a transfer of those shares. In either case, GHBVI's ownership of GHNSI is sufficiently established. The question of who owns the shares in GHBVI begets of but one answer: namely Mr. Allard. It is undisputed that GHNSI owns the Sanctuary. Hence, the Tribunal recognizes that as a Canadian investor it was Mr. Allard who made the investment within Article 1 of the BIT, which he owned and controlled indirectly through GHBVI.\n\nHearing transcript, p. 698, lines 7-10.\n\n85.\n\nIn any event, Mr. Allard directly made successive loans to fund the operations of the Sanctuary project to the extent of some C$18.8 million.74 The Tribunal accepts that these loans separately may constitute a direct investment by the Claimant within the terms of the BIT.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 153.\n\n*Issue 2: Exchange Control Issue*\n---------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal refers to its conclusion above that the Claimant has satisfied his burden of showing that he meets the Treaty's requirements in terms of ownership and control of the Sanctuary at the appropriate times. What remains to be decided is whether the failure to obtain permission from the Exchange Control Authority for the share issuance between GHNSI and GHBVI deprives this Tribunal of jurisdiction.\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Claimant's submission that the Respondent's argument with respect to the Exchange Control Act is untimely. The Respondent's first pleading in the bifurcated jurisdictional phase was its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction of 7 November 2013. In this pleading, Respondent elaborated on its argument that the Tribunal lacked jurisdiction based on the Claimant's non-compliance with Respondent's law.75 The original plea as to lack of jurisdiction based on non-compliance with law had been made in the Respondent's Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction and Request for Bifurcation of 24 May 2013. Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules does not require that every single jurisdictional argument be raised in the Statement of Defense, only that the plea of lack of jurisdiction be made. The Respondent raised the issue of non-conformity with the Exchange Control Act in its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.\n\nJurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6\u00b6 31-33.\n\n88.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimant's shares in GHNSI were not owned or controlled \"in accordance with the latter's laws\" because any issue of shares by GHNSI to GHBVI required prior approval of the Exchange Control Authority and that any transaction performed without approval is void.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal has been presented with conflicting authorities on the effect of the issuance of securities without the Exchange Control Authority's permission. The Respondent's expert, Mr. Griffith, relying on a number of Commonwealth cases, opines that the share issue is invalid.76 The Claimant relies on the 2011 decision of the Barbadian Court of Appeal in *King's Beach Hotels Limited v. Johanna Kesmin Marks*77 and academic commentary,78 which it submits confirms that the modern approach to the interpretation of exchange control legislation is that any contravention does affect the validity of the underlying transaction.\n\nFirst Legal Expert Opinion by Mr. Michael Griffith dated 6 November 2013, \u00b6\u00b6 12-28 and Second Legal Expert Opinion by Mr. Michael Griffith dated 3 February 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 21-36.\n\nKings Beach Hotels Limited v. Marks, Civil Appeal No. 23 of 2006, issued 11 February 2011, \u00b6 4, Exhibit CLA-31.\n\nKodilinye and Kodilinye, Commonwealth Caribbean Contract Law, (New York: Routledge, 2014), p. 187, Exhibit CLA-30.\n\n90.\n\nThe question of whether the Claimant's investment was owned or controlled in accordance with Barbadian law for the purposes Article 1(f) raises two separate issues: (i) the effect of GHNSI's issuance of securities to GHNSI without the Exchange Control Authority's permission; and (ii) the more general question of the effect of the Claimant's failure to ensure that the GHNSI's share issuance was \"in accordance\" with the Exchange Control Act.\n\n91.\n\nWith respect to (i), it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to make a determinative finding whether the issuance of shares in GHNSI to GHBVI was void under Barbadian law for failure to obtain the approval of the Exchange Control Authority. First, whatever view is taken with respect to the Claimant's ownership of GHNSI through GHBVI (whether the issuance of shares was void or not under Barbadian law), it is established that the Claimant in fact controlled GHNSI and the Sanctuary.79 Indeed, Barbadian government officials appear to have consistently acted as if the Claimant controlled the Sanctuary. Other than the question of Exchange Control Authority approval, there does not appear to be any Barbadian law that prohibits Mr. Allard from acquiring, owning, controlling or operating the Sanctuary in the manner that he did. The Respondent has not suggested that there are any other mandatory requirements under Barbadian law that would restrict Mr. Allard's ability to control GHNSI and the Sanctuary. Second, as held above at paragraph 85, Mr. Allard directly made successive loans to fund the operations of the Sanctuary to the extent of some C$18.8 million.80 The Tribunal accepts that these loans separately constitute a direct investment by the Claimant within the terms of the BIT.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 13-92 and accompanying exhibits and witness statements.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 153.\n\n92.\n\nWith respect to (ii), the Tribunal recognizes that Barbados has a legitimate interest in tracking and regulating monies being remitted into its territory. However, there is no basis for finding that GHNSI's issuance of shares to GHBVI is offensive to public policy or tainted with criminality. Further, nothing in the Exchange Control Act appears to prevent the Authority from granting an approval with retrospective effect. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant applied for exchange control approval for loans to GHNSI in 2008 and that the Exchange Control Authority wrote to the Claimant's accountant in 29 August 2008 seeking further information.81 As of the date of the hearing, the Exchange Control Authority had not granted its approval.\n\nCentral Bank of Barbados Exchange Control Act Form FI stamped 5 June 2008, Exhibit C-135.\n\n93.\n\nAlthough the corporate documentary history remains conflicting and incomplete, the Tribunal is satisfied that Mr Allard made an investment in good faith in the Sanctuary. There is no evidence of any misconduct by the Claimant in making the investment. The Claimant did not attempt to conceal his investment in the Sanctuary. The record in these proceedings includes correspondence between Mr. Allard and his advisors and senior government officials regarding Mr. Allard's investment in the Sanctuary.82\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 22-35; Correspondence at Exhibits C-30 to C-36 and C-55.\n\n94.\n\nIn the particular circumstances of this case, the Tribunal is of the view that non-compliance with the Exchange Control Act should be characterized as an inadvertent and technical breach of local law that does not deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction. The non-compliance at issue in this case does not involve the breach of fundamental legal principles of Barbados.83\n\nLESI, S.p.A. and Astaldi S.p.A. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/3, Decision on Jurisdiction dated 12 July 2006, at para. 83(3).\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the Claimant owns and controls assets in accordance with the laws of Barbados and that these assets constitute investments for the purposes of Article 1(f).\n\n**Objection (3): Limitation**\n-----------------------------\n\n96.\n\nThe objection is that under Article XIII (set out in paragraph 26 above) the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction *ratione temporis* since the claim of 21 May 2010 was more than three years after the Claimant acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of his claims, and thereby the claim is time barred.\n\n*The Respondent's arguments*\n----------------------------\n\n97.\n\nNAFTA cases (*Grand River v. USA*84 and *Mondev v. USA*85) confirm that a limitation period similar to the one in Article XIII(3)(d) contains two cumulative requirements, namely:\n\n(1) Constructive notice of the alleged breach; and\n\n(2) Constructive notice that a claimant has incurred loss or damage.\n\nGrand River Enterprises Six Nations Ltd. v.

Letters from April 2000 noted continuing concerns about the \"deficient operation of the sluice gate\".94 Later letters from the Claimant's consultant, Mr. Heaslet, to both the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Public Works and the Chief Environmental Health Officer in the Ministry of Health of Barbados between 2004 and 2005 explicitly addressed the sluice gates issue by \"urgently requesting assistance for interim sealing of the sluice gate in the drainage canal\" and warning of \"warm stagnant [water] conditions [that] may cause a catastrophic decline of fish\".95 On any view, any claim pertaining to the 2005 sewage spill must be \"excluded from the ambit of the BIT\".96\n\nJurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 86, *referring to* Graeme Hall Bird Sanctuary Environmental Management Plan, 11 November 1998, Exhibit C-43, p. 2, which confirms that the Sanctuary as early as 11 November 1998 had \"been subjected to considerable human induced stress and severe damage\".\n\nJurisdictional Objections and Request for Bifurcation, \u00b6 67, *referring to* Statement of Claim, \u00b6 137(b).

Canada* decision99 on which the Claimant relies misapplies the relevant law and ignores the purpose of the limitation period.100 The *UPS* case concerned very specific measures implemented by the host country; whilst here, the Claimant has not identified any specific conduct on the part of the Respondent to support his allegations of a continued breach of the substantive protection provisions under the BIT within the period allowed by Article XIII(3)(d).101 Further, the *Trail Smelter Case* (*U.S. v. Canada*) cited by the Claimant102 concerns a State-to-State dispute in relation to hazardous effects of transboundary damage and is \"highly remote, legally and factually, from the present dispute.\"103\n\nUnited Parcel Service of America, Inc. v.

Government of Canada, Award on the Merits (24 May 2007), UNCITRAL Rules, NAFTA Chapter Eleven, para. 28; Draft ILC Articles of Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with commentaries, 2001, Exhibit CLA-1, Article 14(3) and Commentary citing *Trail Smelter*, p. 1905. See also Reply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 147.\n\n107.\n\nPrinciples under Canadian and English law that limitation periods renew each day that a continuing violation of a legal obligation occurs must be given special weight given that the BIT came into force soon after the entry into force of the NAFTA, and is based on the same model used for all of Canada's post-NAFTA bilateral investment treaties.113 The *UPS* and the *Trail Smelter* Case (*U.S. v. Canada*) decisions are persuasive.114 The *UPS* Tribunal considered the identical language of NAFTA, Article 1116, with respect to the three-year limitation period and held that \"continuing courses of conduct constitute continuing breaches of legal obligation and renew the limitation period accordingly\".115 The decisions relied upon by the Respondent address the issue of whether the limitation period in the NAFTA could be suspended or prolonged, not the date on which the limitation period began to run.116 The *Trail Smelter* confirms that State responsibility is triggered when environmental damage is the result of the failure of a State to take action.117\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 166-172.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 174-183.\n\nReply on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 175, citing *UPS v.

Without presently deciding whether its adoption constituted a breach of the BIT as claimed, and whether the Claimant has incurred any damage as a result, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant nonetheless could not bring a claim premised on the 2003's Plan before its formal adoption.\n\n109.\n\nThe language of the BIT does not give much guidance to the Tribunal on the continuous breach and timing issue.\n\n110.\n\nThe original GHBSI Environmental Management Plan, and its 2000 Amended Environmental Management Plan referenced the sluice gate as a potential problem.118 The Claimant focuses on the Respondent's promise to manage and to take responsibility for resolving those problems. In his Statement of Claim, the Claimant alleges a marked change over time in the Respondent's commitment and approach.119\n\nGraeme Hall Bird Sanctuary Environmental Management Plan, Exhibits C-43; Amended Graeme Hall Bird Sanctuary Environmental Management Plan dated April 2000, Exhibit C-44. Letter from Roger Sweeney to Chief Town Planner dated 24 October 2000, Exhibit C-68.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 138-140.\n\n111.\n\nThe Tribunal regards the sluice gate issue as pleaded as giving rise to challenging issues for decision as it is premised on claims of continuing breach. Although Mr. Allard knew about the potential defects of the sluice gate, the claim now is that the breach arose from the Government's lack of due diligence to carry out the necessary repairs.\n\n112.\n\nIn the result, the Tribunal confirms its jurisdiction *ratione temporis* in respect of the claims relating to the 2003 Amended Plan. However, it is inclined to regard the limitation issue for the sluice gate claims as impleading issues intertwined with those that will arise for determination under the merits phase. In the result, and even if it is plainly framed to side-step an obvious limitation defense, the Tribunal cannot at this phase of a bifurcation hearing on objections dismiss the pleading as untenable.\n\n113.\n\nIn all circumstances, the Tribunal defers and holds over the sluice gate aspect of objection (3) for further consideration and determination on the merits phase.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n**The objections set out in para 29 above are answered -**\n\n**Objections (1) and (2)**\n\n**Yes.**\n\n**Objection (3)**\n\n**Partly Yes, with the \u2018sluice gate\u2019 issue held over to the merits phase.**\n\n**COSTS reserved to final costs orders.**"}, {"Title": "Award", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2016-06-27T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Award\n-----\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **GLOSSARY OF DEFINED TERMS** | |\n| **$** | United States dollar |\n| **1986 Plan** | Barbados National Physical Development Plan of 1986 (exhibit C-29) |\n| **1995 Cummins Letter** | letter dated 18 July 1995 from Mr. Mark Cummins, Chief Town Planner of Barbados, to Philip W.

Allard, c/o Peterco Holding Ltd, 881 Helmcken Street, Vancouver V6Z 1B1, British Columbia, Canada (\"**Mr. Allard**\" or \"**Claimant**\"), a retired attorney and businessman with Canadian nationality, represented in this arbitration by Mr. Robert Wisner and Ms. Cara Zacks of McMillan LLP, Lawyers, Brookfield Place, Suite 4400, Bay Wellington Tower, 181 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5J 2T3, Canada.\n\n2.\n\nThe Respondent is the Government of Barbados, c/o Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Government Headquarters, Bay Street, St. Michael, Barbados (\"**Barbados**\" or \"**Respondent**\", and together with the Claimant, \"**Parties**\"), represented in this arbitration by Messrs. Robert Volterra, Graham Coop, Christophe Bondy, Ms. Jessica Pineda and Mr. Govert Coppens of Volterra Fietta, 1 Fitzroy Square, London W1T 5HE, United Kingdom.\n\n3.\n\nThe dispute between the Parties concerns Mr. Allard's investment in the acquisition and development of an eco-tourism site in Barbados (\"**Sanctuary**\").1 The Claimant claims that Barbados has \"failed to take reasonable and necessary environmental protection measures and, through its organs and agents, has directly contributed to the contamination of the Claimant's eco-tourism site, thereby destroying the value of his investment.\" According to the Claimant, Barbados' \"actions and omissions violate [its] international obligations to Canadian investors\" under the *Agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of Barbados for the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments*, signed on 29 May 1996 (\"**BIT**\").2\n\nNotice of Arbitration dated 21 May 2010, \u00b6 14.\n\nNotice of Arbitration dated 21 May 2010, \u00b6 2.

COMMENCEMENT OF THE ARBITRATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant commenced these proceedings by Notice of Arbitration dated 21 May 2010 pursuant to Article XIII(4) of the BIT and the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as adopted in 1976 (\"**UNCITRAL Rules**\").3\n\nNotice of Arbitration dated 21 May 2010, \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant appointed Professor Andrew Newcombe (Faculty of Law, University of Victoria, PO Box 1700, STN CSC, Victoria, BC, V8W 2Y2, Canada) as arbitrator on 24 November 2011. The Respondent appointed Professor W. Michael Reisman (Yale Law School, 127 Wall Street, New Haven, CT 06511, U.S.A) as arbitrator on 5 January 2012. The co-arbitrators appointed Dr. Gavan Griffith QC (Essex Court Chambers, 24 Lincoln's Inn Fields, London WC2A 3ED, United Kingdom) as presiding arbitrator on 14 March 2012.\n\n6.\n\nOn 22 May 2012, the Tribunal and the Parties signed Terms of Appointment, which, *inter alia*, fixed The Hague, the Netherlands as the place of arbitration and designated the Permanent Court of Arbitration (\"**PCA**\") as registry for the proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nFollowing a procedural hearing held in New York on 7 June 2012 and the circulation of a draft for the Parties' comments, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 1 dated 26 June 2012, *inter alia* establishing the procedural timetable.\n\n8.\n\nOn 9 July 2012, following an exchange of written submissions, the Tribunal issued a Ruling on Confidentiality.\n\n**B. INITIAL PLEADINGS AND BIFURCATION**\n----------------------------------------\n\n9.\n\nOn 18 December 2012, the Claimant filed his Statement of Claim (\"**Statement of Claim**\").\n\n10.\n\nOn 24 May 2013, the Respondent filed preliminary objections to jurisdiction (\"**Jurisdictional Objections**\") and requested the bifurcation of the proceedings between a jurisdictional and a merits phase.\n\n11.\n\nOn 17 June 2013, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits (\"**Counter-Memorial**\").\n\n12.\n\nOn 20 June 2013, following several exchanges of written submissions by the Parties, the Tribunal granted the Respondent's request for bifurcation.\n\n**C. PRELIMINARY PHASE ON THE JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n13.\n\nThe Parties exchanged two rounds of pleadings on the Jurisdictional Objections from September 2013 to February 2014.4\n\nClaimant's Memorial dated 12 September 2013; Respondent's Counter-Memorial dated 7 November 2013; Claimant's Reply dated 3 January 2014; Respondent's Rejoinder on Jurisdiction dated 3 February 2014.\n\n14.\n\nBetween 20 December 2013 and 13 January 2014, the Tribunal made orders in respect of the production of documents by the Claimant and the inspection of those documents by the Respondent and its forensic experts. The Parties' forensic experts filed their respective reports on 31 January 2014 and a joint report on 6 February 2014.\n\n15.\n\nA hearing on the Jurisdictional Objections was held in New York from 18 to 21 February 2014.

MERITS PHASE**\n-------------------\n\n17.\n\nBetween July 2014 and February 2015, the Parties agreed to suspend the establishment of a procedural calendar for the merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n18.\n\nOn 27 February 2015, after consulting the Parties, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 2, establishing the calendar for the merits phase of the proceedings, including a two-week hearing to be held in December 2015 (\"**Hearing**\").\n\n19.\n\nOn 27 March 2015, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 3, deciding on contested document production requests made by the Claimant.\n\n20.\n\nOn 27 April 2015, the Claimant filed his Reply (\"**Reply**\").\n\n21.\n\nOn 30 June 2015, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 4, deciding on contested document production requests made by the Respondent.\n\n22.\n\nThe Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits (\"**Rejoinder**\") on 1 September 2015.\n\n23.\n\nOn 1 October 2015, the Parties notified the Tribunal of the witnesses they wished to call for crossexamination at the Hearing.\n\n24.\n\nOn 1 December 2015, the Parties filed their respective skeleton arguments (\"**Claimant's Skeleton Argument**\" and \"**Respondent's Skeleton Argument**\").\n\n25.\n\nOn the same date, the Claimant submitted, without leave, two supplementary reports prepared by his environmental experts, Mr. Thomas F. Ries and Mr. Robert E. Wallace (\"**Ries Supplemental Report**\" and \"**Wallace Supplemental Report**\").\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated 4 December 2015, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal: (i) exclude from the record the Claimant's Skeleton Argument and the Ries Supplemental Report; and (ii) grant the Respondent an opportunity to respond to the Wallace Supplemental Report. The Tribunal informed the Parties on 5 December that the determination of the Respondent's requests would be held over to the Hearing, but invited the Respondent to prepare its response to the Wallace Supplemental Report in the meantime.\n\n27.\n\nThe Hearing was held at the New York International Arbitration Center from 8 to 17 December 2015.

Ries, November 2015.\n\n30.\n\nThe Tribunal did not make a determination on the Respondent's request for the exclusion from the record of the Claimant's Skeleton Argument at the Hearing and, accordingly, addresses this request here. The Respondent submitted that the document filed by the Claimant exceeds the normal scope of a skeleton argument, as it makes certain new arguments in response to the Respondent's Rejoinder.9 Overall, the Respondent identified only a few paragraphs that contained such allegedly new arguments10 and the content of these paragraphs was reiterated in the course of the Claimant's opening and closing statements at the Hearing, without any objection from the Respondent.11 In this context, the Tribunal does not see what prejudice the Respondent would suffer by the admission of the Claimant's Skeleton Argument. Accordingly, the Respondent's request for the exclusion from the record of the Claimant's Skeleton Argument is rejected.\n\nRespondent's letter dated 4 December 2015, pp. 2-3; Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 20:6-18; 21:22-22:2.\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 20:2-5.\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 42:16-44:25; 45:17-47:1 (Claimant's opening statement); Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1470:21-1471:3; 1480:13-1481:3 (Claimant's closing statement).\n\n31.\n\nOn 9 and 10 February 2016 respectively, the Claimant and the Respondent filed submissions on costs (\"**Claimant's Costs Submission**\" and \"**Respondent's Costs Submission**\").\n\n32.\n\nOn 7 March 2016, the Parties filed reply submissions on costs (\"**Claimant's Reply on Costs**\" and \"**Respondent's** **Reply on Costs**\").\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n33.\n\nIn 1994, Mr. Allard decided to acquire and develop land in Barbados for an eco-tourism attraction.12 To this end, in October 1996, he incorporated the Barbadian company Graeme Hall Bird Sanctuary Inc. (\"**GHNSI**\"), which in three separate land conveyances dated 1996, 1998 and 1999 acquired the Sanctuary, comprising in total 34.25 acres of land located in the western part of some 240 acres of wetlands on the south coast of Barbados (\"**Graeme Hall Swamp**\").13\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 10; Witness statement by Mr. Peter A.

THE PARTIES' REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n----------------------------------------\n\n47.\n\nIn his Statement of Claim, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal render an award:\n\n(a) declaring that it has jurisdiction to hear Mr. Allard's claim under the [BIT];\n\n(b) declaring that Barbados breached its obligations under Articles II(2) and VIII of the [BIT];\n\n(c) ordering Barbados to pay monetary compensation to Mr. Allard in the amount of C$34,630,700 million plus compound interest thereon from November 30, 2012; and;\n\n(d) granting Mr. Allard his costs of this arbitration and costs of legal representation and assistance in an amount to be determined in a final award.35\n\n\u00b6 164.\n\n48.\n\nIn his Reply and Skeleton Argument, the Claimant amends his claim for monetary compensation to C$29,026,200.36\n\nReply, p. 35; Claimant's Skeleton Argument, \u00b6 60.\n\n49.\n\nIn defence, the Respondent requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(i) Decline jurisdiction over all claims in relation to the sluice gate on the grounds that the Claimant was aware or should have been aware of the sluice gate issue and any alleged resulting damage prior to 21 May 2007 and that the Tribunal's jurisdiction is therefore precluded under Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT;\n\n(ii) Dismiss the Claimant's remaining claims on the merits in their entirety;\n\n(iii) Declare that the Claimant is not entitled to any damages; and\n\n(iv) Order the Claimant to pay all of the Respondent's costs in connection with these proceedings, including the Tribunal's fees and expenses and all legal fees and expenses incurred by the Respondent (including, but not limited to, the fees and expenses of legal counsel, experts and consultants).37\n\nRespondent's Skeleton Argument, p. 12. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 421; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 162-165.\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' ARGUMENTS AND THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n50.\n\nIn summary, the Claimant's case is that the actions and inactions of Barbados concerning the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate and other issues, caused and/or failed to mitigate a significant degradation of the environment and the \"tourist experience\" at the Sanctuary, to an extent obliging the Claimant to close the Sanctuary, and thereby depriving him of the entire benefit of his investment in Barbados.\n\n51.\n\nThe actions and inactions of Barbados are claimed to constitute breaches of its obligations under the BIT:\n\n(i) to accord \"fair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of International Law\" (\"**FET**\") (Article II(2)(a));\n\n(ii) to accord \"full protection and security\" (\"**FPS**\") (Article II(2)(b)); and\n\n(iii) not to expropriate, except \"for a public purpose under due process of law, in a nondiscriminatory manner and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation\" (Article VIII).38\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 93, 104-140; Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 91-112.\n\n52.\n\nThe Respondent's position is that:\n\n(i) The Claimant closed the Sanctuary for business reasons unrelated to the environmental conditions at the site.\n\n(ii) During the relevant period, the environmental conditions at the Sanctuary were not degraded, but either stayed the same or improved.\n\n(iii) Alternatively, any degradation as did occur, arose from external causes and the Claimant's own actions and inactions.\n\n(iv) In any event, Barbados took appropriate steps for the environmental protection of the Sanctuary.\n\n(v) Accordingly, Barbados has complied with all of its obligations under the BIT.\n\n(vi) Moreover, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims and, in particular, as formulated in the Respondent's objection held over from the Jurisdictional Objections phase,39 over the Claimant's claims relating to the Sluice Gate.\n\n*See* paragraph 16 above.\n\n53.\n\nHence, underlying the claims is a fundamental factual disagreement as to whether the Claimant has suffered loss or damage as a result of any actions or inactions of Barbados.\n\n54.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal first addresses these factual issues in **Section A** below, before turning to the alleged breaches of the BIT in **Section B** and the Respondent's jurisdictional objections in **Section C**.\n\n**A. FACTUAL ISSUES - WHETHER THE CLAIMANT SUFFERED LOSS OR DAMAGE AS A RESULT OF ANY ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF BARBADOS**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, at the time of his investment, the Sanctuary was a \"natural wonder\" and \"biodiversity treasure\" with the \"potential to attract eco-tourism if it was highlighted and showcased to tourists and visitors.\"40 Although the Claimant acknowledges the prior existence of certain discrete environmental issues, such as overfishing by trespassers, neglect and an overgrowth of sour grass, he contends that GHNSI addressed these issues promptly after its purchase of the Sanctuary.41\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 13; Reply, \u00b6 12.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15.\n\n56.\n\nIt is claimed that after acquisition the Sanctuary suffered significant environmental degradation that progressively transformed it into \"little more than a mosquito-infested swamp\"42 by the time of closure in 2009. The Claimant invokes the circumstances of declines in water salinity, water quality and biodiversity,43 and also complains of \"occasional bad odours\" and \"pools of stagnant water that attract large populations of mosquitoes.\"44 Relying on the observations of Mr. Ryan Chenery, a former employee of the Sanctuary, and the conclusions of his environmental experts, Environmental Engineering Consultants (\"**EEC**\"), the Claimant asserts that there was:\n\n(i) damage to the mangrove trees;\n\n(ii) a decline in the number of fish species, from somewhere in the range of 18 to 42 species to 11 species;\n\n(iii) an increase in the number of fish kills (*i.e.*, incidents of many fish dying at the same time);\n\n(iv) a steady decline in bird population and bird species, as concerns the latter from 45 observed species in 2005 to 35 in 2007 and 30 in 2008; and\n\n(v) a marked decrease in the number of crabs.45\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 77.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 67-70.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 76.\n\nReply, \u00b6 62, referring to Witness Statement by Mr. Ryan Chenery dated 25 April 2015 (\"Chenery Statement\"), \u00b6\u00b6 26-36; Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1510:23-25, 1660:5-10 (Claimant's closing statement). *See also* Statement of Claim, \u00b6 76.\n\n57.\n\nThe Claimant alleges three causes for this degradation of the environment: the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate, the 2005 sewage spill and the Zoning Changes.\n\n58.\n\n*The mismanagement of the Sluice Gate*. The claim is that \"most of the damage\" stems from the improper operation by Barbados of the Sluice Gate,46 which was intended to \"allow for a proper tidal exchange between the seawater and the water in the Sanctuary's swamp,\" but remained closed and non-operative due to lack of maintenance.47 As a result, the wetlands became cut off from the sea and were gradually transformed from a brackish (mixed salt and fresh water) into a freshwater system.48 Salinity measured at 19 parts per thousand (\"**ppt**\") in 1987, declined to 8.4 ppt in 20022003 and to 1.9 ppt in 2010.49 This reduction, together with a decrease in tidal effects, was detrimental to the mangrove trees and the many species that rely on the typically brackish nature of a mangrove ecosystem.50 In addition, the inoperability of the Sluice Gate prevented pollutants from extraneous sources from being flushed into the sea and increased the risk of flooding.51 In contrast, on the very few occasions (if more than one) when sea water flowed freely into Graeme Hall Swamp, the positive impact on the water, which turned from \"dark\", \"stagnant\" and \"opaque\" into \"completely crystal clear\", and on several species of fauna, was readily apparent.52\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 4; Reply, \u00b6 2.\n\nReply, \u00b6 41.\n\nReply, \u00b6 55; Expert Report by EEC dated 12 December 2012 (\"First EEC Report\"), \u00b6 7.\n\nReply, \u00b6 52, referring to Expert Report by EEC dated 22 April 2015 (\"Second EEC Report\"), p. 6. *See also* First EEC Report, \u00b6 43, referring to Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, pp. 55-56.\n\nFirst EEC Report, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 20-21, 42-46; Second EEC Report, pp. 12-14; Reply, \u00b6 64.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 38, referring to Witness Statement of Mr. Stuart Heaslet dated 13 December 2012 (\"First Heaslet Statement\"), \u00b6 10; First EEC Report.

As a single event in 2005, raw sewage contaminated the Sanctuary, curtailing all environmental tours and educational operations.53 The effect of this pollution was exacerbated by the inoperability of the Sluice Gate.54\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 72-73.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 73; First EEC Report, \u00b6 9.\n\n60.\n\n*Zoning Changes*. The environmental degradation of the Sanctuary was \"compounded\" by the reclassification of lands adjacent to the Sanctuary under the 2003 Plan.55 The implementation of the Zoning Changes is claimed as something that would increase the run-off of contaminants into the Sanctuary and diminish the quality of the visitor experience at the Sanctuary by reducing the \"tranquillity\" of the site.56 The Claimant notes that the Second ARA Report confirms the critical importance of having a \"buffer zone\" for the environmental health of Graeme Hall Swamp.57\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 81. *See also* Statement of Claim, \u00b6 5; Reply, \u00b6 74.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 84-85; Reply, \u00b6 89; First EEC Report, \u00b6 12.\n\nStatement of Claimant, \u00b6 53, referring to Exhibit C-57, Second ARA Report, p. 11-1.\n\n61.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the alternative explanations for the reduction in water salinity, water quality and biodiversity at the Sanctuary proposed by the Respondent's environmental expert, Professor Wayne Hunte.58*Inter alia*, the Claimant asserts that Professor Hunte's opinion that the Sluice Gate was not an important mechanism for exchange between the sea and the wetlands due to subsurface exchange, should be disregarded as being inconsistent with:\n\n(i) the position taken by Barbados' own consultants outside of this arbitration;\n\n(ii) the fact that only freshwater species live near the bottom of the Sanctuary lake;\n\n(iii) geologic cross-sections showing that there is a freshwater lens immediately underneath the Sanctuary; and\n\n(iv) the observed decline in salinity at the Sanctuary.59\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 52-59, 65-69.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 56-57, referring to Exhibit C-184, Excerpt from Second ARA Report.\n\n**2. The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent disputes that the Sanctuary suffered any material environmental degradation between 1994, when the Claimant \"first launched his plans,\" and 2009, when he closed the Sanctuary.60 Alternatively, the Respondent submits that such degradation as did occur, did not arise from the Respondent's actions or inactions.61 In particular, Mr. Allard closed the Sanctuary for business rather than environmental reasons, having come to realize that his project was not economically viable.62\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 40.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 9.\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 87:20-91:3 (Respondent's opening statement).\n\n63.\n\nFirst, the Respondent asserts that, in 1994, the ecology of the site already reflected a series of \"preexisting physical constraints.\"63 In its original state centuries ago, Graeme Hall Swamp was \"part of a much wider mangrove system which communicated directly with the sea\" through an estuary,64 but from the early 1700s the wetlands were increasingly separated from the sea through human intervention, in particular following the construction of a coastal road leaving only a stream linking the swamp with the sea.65 In the 1930s, a gun club built the Sluice Gate across the stream, not \"as a conduit for seawater to enter the wetlands,\" but to create and control water levels in \"freshwater shooting ponds.\"66 Further, in 1972 and 1973, the western section of Graeme Hall Swamp (where the Sanctuary is located) was dredged for an aborted residential development project, creating a lake and \"exacerbat[ing] the longstanding drainage issues by effectively creating an additional shelf between [the lake] and the sea.\"67 Finally, in 1984, a tropical storm resulted in a variable build-up of sand extending up to 130 metres as a beach between the Sluice Gate and the sea; this limited the interchange of water between the swamp and the sea.68\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 82; *see also* \u00b6 39.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 41, referring to Exhibit C-43, First EMP, p. 1.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 41, 52, referring to Exhibit C-43, First EMP, p. 1; Exhibit R-52, Graeme Hall Bird Sanctuary Biologist Report by Dr. Ingrid Sylvester, September 2000, p. 21.\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 10, *quoting* Expert Report by Prof. Wayne Hunte dated 26 August 2015 (\"Second Hunte Report\"), p. 3; Rejoinder, \u00b6 43, referring to Exhibit C-56, First ARA Report, Part 1, p. 3.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 48, referring to Exhibit C-56, First ARA Report, Part 1, p. 5-1; Exhibit C-57, Second ARA Report, Part 2, p. 7-1; Exhibit R-52, Graeme Hall Bird Sanctuary Biologist Report by Dr. Ingrid Sylvester, September 2000, p. 21.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 50-51, 57, referring to Witness Statement by Dr. Lorna Inniss dated 27 August 2015 (\"Inniss Statement\"), \u00b6\u00b6 21-22; Exhibit C-43, First EMP, p. 18; Exhibit C-72, Draft Master Plan for the Graeme Hall Ecosystem, September 2007, p. 5; Second Hunte Report, p. 4.\n\n64.\n\nHence, it was these human and natural events that caused the transformation of the Sanctuary from a \"typical mangrove ecosystem with an estuary connecting the inland water to the sea\" to a \"somewhat fresher ecosystem.\"69 For this reason, it is inappropriate to compare the flora and fauna of the Sanctuary with that of typical mangrove ecosystems.70\n\nSecond Hunte Report, pp. 2, 4-5. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 42, 52, 77, referring to Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report; Exhibit C-57, Second ARA Report, Part 2, p. 7-1; Exhibit R-71, Minutes of Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee meeting, of 17 October 2005, 4 November 2005, pp. 2-3, 5.\n\nExpert Report by Prof. Wayne Hunte dated 17 June 2013 (\"First Hunte Report\"), pp. 9, 27; Second Hunte Report, p. 3; Rejoinder, \u00b6 44, referring to Exhibit C-43, First EMP, p. 1.\n\n65.\n\nIn addition, the Sanctuary's situation at the bottom of a catchment area of approximately 1156 acres gave rise to \"significant drainage issues,\" which hampered pollution discharge from adjacent agricultural and residential activity.71\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 40, 46, 72-74. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 42; First Hunte Report, p. 6.\n\n66.\n\nThus, the records from its early days recognize the imperfect environmental health position of the Sanctuary. The First EMP stated that \"[c]omparative data from other mangrove eco-systems within the Caribbean Basin which have retained their open links with the sea, demonstrates that Graeme Hall [Swamp] is fish species poor.\"72 The Amended EMP and the First ARA Report each documented fish kills, while the First EMP also referred to a decline in bird diversity.73\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 79, referring to Exhibit C-43, First EMP, p. 1.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 83, 88, referring to Exhibit C-43, First EMP, pp. 2, 5; Exhibit C-44, Amended EMP, p. 6; Exhibit C-56, First ARA Report, Part 1, pp. 4-6.\n\n67.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, this much was admitted by the Claimant. In a letter dated 26 February 1996, a representative stated that the wetlands had been \"rendered ecologically unsound,\"74 and in a later letter dated 28 November 1996, the Claimant himself stated that Graeme Hall Swamp was \"an abused and degraded ecosystem.\"75\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 81, referring to Exhibit C-32, Letter from Joseph Ward to the Minister of Finance of Barbados, 26 February 1996.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 81, referring to Exhibit C-36, Letter from Peter A. Allard to the Prime Minister of Barbados, 28 November 1996. *See also* Exhibit R-53, Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Biologist Report by Dr. Ingrid Sylvester, April 2001, p. 4.\n\n68.\n\nSecond, the Respondent asserts that between 1994 and 2009 there was no actual degradation in the environmental conditions at the Sanctuary and that, in fact, they were substantially stable or even improved.\n\n69.\n\n*Water salinity*. Salinity measurements used by the Claimant are misleading as they were taken in a very short monitoring period (in February 2010). Data collected by the Caribbean Coastal Marine Productivity Program (\"**CARICOMP**\") confirms that salinity was low in February 2010, but also shows that \"there continues to be inter-annual variation in salinity values\" and that \"there has not been a uni-directional transition to fresh water\" over the period of the Claimant's investment.76 Professor Hunte's opinion is that the low salinity figure of February 2010 was due to the pumping of freshwater into the swamp by the Sanctuary, in accordance with its policy to pump freshwater from the springs into the lake to maintain water levels during periods of drought.77\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 2.\n\nFirst Hunte Report, pp. 4-5, referring to Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 8; Second Hunte Report, p. 5.\n\n70.\n\n*Water quality.* Comparing the full available data set for 2002-2003 to 2010, Professor Hunte concludes that water quality at the Sanctuary has improved over that period with respect to all parameters.78 Professor Hunte further states that even if the 2005 sewage spill had a negative effect on the Sanctuary, the effect was not lasting.79 Moreover, the Respondent asserts that the Claimant himself regularly used pesticides at the Sanctuary.80\n\nFirst Hunte Report, pp. 3, 7, 11-12; Second Hunte Report, pp. 8-10.\n\nFirst Hunte Report, p. 7.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 117, referring to Witness Statement by Ms. Donna Roach dated 3 September 2013, p. 1.\n\n71.\n\n*Mangroves*. Professor Hunte invokes an expert in mangroves hired by EEC in 2010, stating that \"[t]he Sanctuary mangroves were verdant and healthy.\"81\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 31, referring to Exhibit C-217, Attachment 11 to 2010 EEC Report..\n\n72.\n\n*Crabs, birds and fish*. Professor Hunte states that there is no quantitative evidence of the decrease in the number of crabs at the Sanctuary and suggests that if there was a decrease, it would most likely be due to predation by mongoose and wading birds such as the glossy ibis.82 Professor Hunte also suggests that any perceived reduction of the fish and bird population at the Sanctuary may be due to methodological flaws in Mr. Chenery's censuses. Thus, the reduction in the numbers of birds observed by Mr. Chenery from one year to the next may be the result of the corresponding reduction in the number of bird census walks.83 The difference between the numbers of fish counted in 1987 and 2009 may be explained by the fact that the 1987 count was conducted by four highly trained scientists using more varied methods than those employed by Mr. Chenery in 2009.84 Professor Hunte also indicates that fish kills occur from time to time as \"natural events\", because periods of heavy rainfall can cause \"low oxygen water at depth to be redistributed throughout the water column, resulting in fish mortality through oxygen deprivation.\"85\n\nSecond Hunte Report, pp. 22-23, 31-32.\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 15.\n\nSecond Hunte Report, pp. 17, 22.\n\nFirst Hunte Report, pp. 6, 10.\n\n73.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent asserts that, \"[i]n the absence of any adequate baseline data or systematic ongoing monitoring data,\" the claim that Mr. Allard closed the Sanctuary due to the environmental degradation of the site and not other reasons is \"manifestly ungrounded in fact\"86 and is to be rejected.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 107.\n\n74.\n\nThird, the Respondent disputes the importance of the Sluice Gate for the exchange of water between Graeme Hall Swamp and the sea.87 According to Professor Hunte, since the beach accretion of 1984, seawater at high tide reached the Sluice Gate canal only exceptionally, during extreme weather conditions.88\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 16.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 56, referring to Second Hunte Report, pp. ii, 4, 13, 24, 28.\n\n75.\n\nMoreover, Professor Hunte's opinion is that the geology of Barbados ensures that \"nearly all exchange between inland water and seawater occurs subsurface.\"89 This exchange is evidenced at the Sanctuary by:\n\n(i) the fact that the lake maintained brackish water conditions even when seawater could not reach the Sanctuary overland due to the beach accretion; and\n\n(ii) water testing results showing that the salinity of sub-surface water at the Sanctuary exceeds that of the lake.90\n\nFirst Hunte Report, pp. 2, 4.\n\nSecond Hunte Report, pp. ii-iii, 3-4.\n\n76.\n\nAccordingly, the Sluice Gate has had little or no impact on salinity during the Claimant's ownership of the Sanctuary. In any event, the Claimant is incorrect to claim that since his purchase in 1996 the Sluice Gate has remained completely closed: in fact, the Respondent during this period has \"maintained the opening and closing of the canal, either by the Sluice Gate or by alternate means.\"91\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 66, 319.\n\n77.\n\nFourth, the Respondent contends that the Zoning Changes had a positive impact on environmental conditions at the Sanctuary. The reallocation of the broader area around Graeme Hall Swamp from an open and major recreational space to a predominantly residential space has no \"practical significance.\"92 Further, an area significantly larger than the Sanctuary was designated a National Heritage Conservation Area, ensuring that \"additional weight\" would be given to \"conservation considerations in Graeme Hall not only when considering proposed development plans for Graeme Hall itself, but also for areas upstream of Graeme Hall\" in its large catchment area.93\n\nCounter-Memorial, \u00b6 55, referring to Witness Statement by Mr. Mark Cummins dated 13 June 2013 (\"First Cummins Statement\"), \u00b6\u00b6 10-12.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 171, referring to Witness Statement by Mr. Mark Cummins dated 25 August 2015 (\"Second Cummins Statement\"), \u00b6 11. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 55; Rejoinder, \u00b6 169-173.\n\n78.\n\nAdditionally, as confirmed by Professor Hunte, the Zoning Changes increased the protection of the Sanctuary, as it is easier to control pollution from \"point sources such as commercial operations and residences\" than from \"non-point sources\" such as agriculture.94 And, in fact, there has been no intervening development at all, apart from one small project the approval of which was subject to the fulfilment of a number of environmental conditions.95\n\nFirst Hunte Report, pp. 8-9; Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 57.\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 147:10-23 (Respondent's opening statement), referring to Exhibit R-32, List of Development Applications within the Graeme Hall Conservation Zone from 1992 to 2007. *See also* Rejoinder, \u00b6 173, referring to Second Cummins Statement, \u00b6 15; Exhibit R-34, Application No. 1974/07/2008D pursuant to Town and Country Planning Act, CAP. 240 (Permission to Develop Subject to Conditions), 2008, p. 4.\n\n79.\n\nFifth, and finally, the Respondent contends that in fact \"the Claimant closed the Sanctuary because it was hemorrhaging money\" due to its \"failure... as a business.\"96 In particular, the Claimant expected to generate a significant part of his revenue from agreements with package tour and cruise ship operators, but was unable to secure such contracts.97\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1546:7-1547:4 (Respondent's closing statement).\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 87:20-91:3 (Respondent's opening statement).\n\n**3. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n80.\n\nIn this Section, the Tribunal considers whether the Claimant has suffered loss or damage and whether that loss or damage (if any) was caused by actions or inactions of Barbados.\n\n81.\n\nThe Parties accept that the burden is on the Claimant to establish each factor of loss, as well as causation.\n\n82.\n\nThe Claimant's claim is for the loss of the ecotourism attraction constituted by the Sanctuary. Following its closure, its operations now are confined to a roadside caf\u00e9.98 The Claimant asserts that his investment was to \"generate revenue from ticket sales and services provided to visitors,\"99 and that he was forced to cease operating this business when cumulative environmental damage resulted in a \"net deterioration into the value for money that the Sanctuary [could] offer visitors.\"100 As the Claimant put it at the Hearing, \"without the natural environment, operating the Sanctuary would essentially be like asking people to visit a zoo without any animals or an aquarium without any fish.\"101\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1516:22-1517:5; 1668:16-17 (Claimant's closing statement); Rejoinder, \u00b6 116.\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 41:18-22 (Claimant's opening statement).\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1510:14-16 (Claimant's closing statement).\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 41:23-25 (Claimant's opening statement).\n\n83.\n\nFollowing the Jurisdictional Objections phase, the Respondent accepts that the Claimant's investment \"was the business of an eco-tourism site.\"102\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1539:3-4 (Respondent's closing statement). *See also* Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1629:17-20 (Respondent's closing statement): \"The investment was the purchase of what was about 90 percent of the site in December of 1996, with the intention of pursuing it as an eco-tourism venture.\"\n\n84.\n\nAccordingly, to establish loss the Claimant first must establish that there was a degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary sufficient to render operating the Sanctuary as an ecotourism attraction impossible or financially unsustainable. This remains an objective enquiry, uncontrolled by Mr. Allard's own perception of the degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary.\n\n85.\n\nThe relevant period of the alleged environmental degradation for consideration is from the Claimant's initial investment in Barbados in 1996 (on his initial purchase of approximately 29 of the 34.25 acres comprising the Sanctuary site)103 to the closure of the Sanctuary as an ecotourism attraction in 2009 (\"**Relevant Period**\"). The enquiry is whether, by the latter date, the Claimant can prove a sufficient change had occurred in the environmental conditions at the Sanctuary to justify his decision to close.\n\nExhibit C-17, Property conveyance between Property Consultants Ltd. and GHNSI, 20 December 1996.\n\n86.\n\nAs to causation, the Claimant must show that any environmental damage to the Sanctuary that can be proved was caused by actions or inactions of Barbados and, in particular, by the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate.\n\n**(a) Factual analysis - Alleged degradation**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n87.\n\nAs noted, the Parties' principal factual dispute is whether there was such a degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period as to render its operation as an ecotourism attraction impossible or financially unsustainable justifying closure. They refer to the following parameters:\n\n(i) water salinity;\n\n(ii) other water quality parameters;\n\n(iii) the health of the mangroves;\n\n(iv) the diversity and health of fish;\n\n(v) the diversity and health of birds; and\n\n(vi) the health of crabs.\n\nThe Tribunal examines each of these parameters in turn.\n\n*(i) Water salinity*\n--------------------\n\n88.\n\nThe Parties' environmental experts agree that water salinity may be taken as an indicator of the Sanctuary's environmental health, as a sharp decline in salinity may harm the mangrove ecosystem.104 However, the experts disagree as to whether, as a matter of fact, during the Relevant Period:\n\n(i) the salinity of the Sanctuary waters declined; and\n\n(ii) the Sanctuary waters became either entirely fresh or so fresh as to be harmful to the mangrove ecosystem.105\n\nSee discussion of the potential impact of a decline in salinity on the health of mangroves at paragraphs 114-115 below. *See also* First EEC Report, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 20-21, 42-46, 61, 63; Expert Report on Mangrove Conditions by Thomas F.

Divergent classification systems accept that fresh water has salinity of less than 2 or 5 ppt; brackish water corresponds to salinity between 3 or 6 and 16 or 29 ppt; and saline water has salinity either 16 or 29 ppt and above.106 The Tribunal need not make findings as to which of these ranges is definitive at each level.\n\nFor EEC's definitions, *see* Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 25; Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 875, 967 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace). For Professor Hunte's definitions, *see* Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1134-1136 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\n90.\n\nThe Tribunal has before it salinity data from five sources, covering different dates or periods:\n\n(i) In 1986, an undergraduate marine biology student, Christopher Parker, in a paper called \"Ecological Aspects of the Graeme Hall Swamp\u2014Water Analysis of the Drainage Canal\" (\"**Parker Paper**\"), reported measuring salinity in the canal ranging from 29 to 34 ppt.107\n\n(ii) In 1987, Antonia Cattaneo and three other scientists from McGill University, in a report prepared for the Ministry of Housing of Barbados (\"**Cattaneo Report**\"), indicated having measured salinity in the Sanctuary lake and canal of 19 ppt for all depths.108\n\n(iii) In the context of a water quality monitoring programme largely carried out by the University of the West Indies under the supervision of Professor Hunte (\"**2001-2003 Monitoring Programme**\"), bi-monthly salinity measurements were taken from October 2000 to October 2001 and again from April 2002 to March 2003 at 16 sampling stations (and substations) in the Sanctuary, of which three were located in the lake,109 and at one sampling station in the canal.110 During the 2000 to 2001 investigation period, the Programme recorded salinity values between 0 and 11.9 ppt in the lake, and between 0 and 15.8 ppt in the canal.111 During the 2002 to 2003 investigation period, the Programme recorded salinity values between 4.83 and 10.58 ppt in the lake, and between 4.55 and 8.15 in the canal.112\n\n(iv) The Claimant's environmental experts EEC, in a technical report dated April 2010 (\"**2010 EEC Report**\"), indicated that they measured an average salinity of 1.9 ppt at six stations in the lake and south pond in February 2010.113 In addition to making salinity measurements, EEC investigated the lake's bottom-dwelling (benthic) community,114 finding predominantly freshwater organisms.115\n\n(v) In 1993, and during the period 2006-2015, salinity data were collected at the surface of the lake by CARICOMP. The CARICOMP data were submitted to the Tribunal by the Respondent's environmental expert, Professor Hunte, in the form of a graph showing average annual salinity, including: 3.8 ppt for 1993, 1.7 ppt for 2006, 7.7 ppt for 2008, 1.0 ppt for 2010 and 4.0 ppt for 2015.116\n\nExhibit C-183, p. 7.\n\nExhibit C-180, Antonia Cattaneo *et al*., \"A Limnological and Ichtyological Reconnaissance of Graeme Hall Swamp,\" July 1987, pp. 12-13.\n\nStations 7A, 7B and 10.\n\nExhibit C-67, Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Water Quality Monitoring Programme, Report for the Period October 2000-October 2001, pp. 1, 5, 26-28, 30; Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Water Quality Monitoring Programme, Report No. 2, April 2002-March 2003, filed as Annex B to First Hunte Report, pp. 5, 26-28, 30.\n\nExhibit C-67, Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Water Quality Monitoring Programme, Report for the Period October 2000-October 2001, p. 23.\n\nOther sampling stations were located in the springs, trays, ponds and storm drains.

While EEC calculates the average of the values for all the sampling stations located in the lake and the south pond, it may be noted that excluding the south pond stations would only minimally affect the average. Using only the values for stations 7A, 7B and 10, which are labeled \"lake\" by EEC, yields an average of 1.97 ppt. Additionally excluding the value for station 7A, as does Professor Hunte (Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1115-1116 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte)), because it is located at the entrance of the south pond, yields an average of 1.95 ppt.\n\nExhibit C-223, Attachment 18 to the 2010 EEC Report, \"Analysis of Benthic Samples Collected from the Graeme Hall Nature Preserve,\" Terra Environmental Services, 9 April 2010.\n\nEEC characterizes all of the species found as freshwater (Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 19; Exhibit C-223. Attachment 18 to 2010 EEC Report, \"Analysis of Benthic Samples Collected from the Graeme Hall Nature Preserve,\" Terra Environmental Services, 9 April 2010, p. 3), while Professor Hunte opines that the two most common of the 17 species found can survive in brackish water (Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1232:15-17 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte)).\n\nSecond Hunte Report, pp. 2, 4 and Appendix B, graph of CARICOMP salinity data for 1993-2015.\n\n91.\n\nRelying on data from the Parker Paper, the Cattaneo Report, the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme and the 2010 EEC Report, ECC argues that the Sanctuary has transformed from a brackish to a fresh water ecosystem.117 In response, Professor Hunte criticizes several of the sources relied upon by EEC and finds support in the CARICOMP data to deny the occurrence of a unidirectional change in salinity.118\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, \u00b6 43; Second EEC Report, pp. 5-6; Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 960:9-961:25 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace).\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 2.\n\n92.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that there is seasonal variation in the salinity of the Sanctuary waters from lower in the wet season to higher in the dry season. EEC and Professor Hunte acknowledge that this variation was observed and documented in the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme,119 the only occasion on which salinity at the Sanctuary was systematically studied over a period of time.120 It follows that, in comparing salinity values in different periods, care must be taken not to overlook the impact of seasonal variation.\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1192:6-7 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte); Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 986:13-988:8 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace). *See also* Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, pp. 10, 28, 30, 32, 41; Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 979:3-980:9 (examination of Mr. Robert E.

Professor Hunte's opinion that the high salinity values of the Parker Paper may be explained by a \"significant storm event\"121 is speculative and inconsistent with the Parker Paper's statement that the measurements were taken in a \"period of drought.\"122 In any event, such a storm event would only serve to explain why the salinity values of the Parker Paper are higher than those of the Cattaneo Report. Moreover, Professor Hunte's distrust of the values of the Cattaneo Report on the ground that they are inconsistent with the values recorded during the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme123 appears to be based on an inapt comparison, as the readings are too distant in time to justify any assumption that they should be identical or similar. While, as suggested by Professor Hunte, it is unlikely that a single value (19 ppt) was measured at all depths and locations in the Sanctuary,124 this circumstance does not suffice to discredit the Cattaneo Report, but merely to suggest that the salinity value quoted is an approximation. Professor Hunte agreed that the authors of the Cattaneo Report were highly trained scientists,125 and they themselves stated that \"[s]alinityf was about 19 parts per thousand... at all depths and stations sampled.\"126\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1189:2-13 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\nExhibit C-183, Parker Paper, p. 10. The Tribunal does not find the reported presence of uprooted sea grass in the canal to be significant, where the Parker Paper itself does not mention any notable climatic conditions.\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1199:2-1200:13 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte). *See also* Supplementary Hunte Report.\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1197:15-1198:24 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte). *See also* Supplementary Hunte Report.\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 119:8-12 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte)\n\nExhibit C-180, Cattaneo Report, p.12 (emphasis added).\n\n95.\n\nAs for the period 2001 to 2015, all sources of information, namely the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme, the 2010 EEC Report and the CARICOMP programme, record salinity readings in the lake and the canal (whether in the wet or dry season) lower than the 19 ppt recorded in the lake by the Cattaneo Report and the 29 to 34 ppt recorded in the canal by the Parker Paper during the dry season.127 Professor Hunte's hypothesis that the low salinity value of February 2010 may have resulted from the pumping of fresh water into the Sanctuary by the Claimant's employees128 was raised by the Claimant's own environmental experts in their early report,129 noting observations of the level of the lake rising \"by several centimetres without the aid of rainfall\" during the pumping event.130 However, as the direct evidence of the limited capacity and use of the pump to effect such dilutions militates to the contrary,131 the Tribunal is unable to find that the values of the 2010 EEC Report resulted from the pumping of fresh water.\n\nAs mentioned above, the salinity measurements of the Parker Paper were taken during a \"period of drought.\" Exhibit C-183, Parker Paper, p. 10. The measurements of the Cattaneo Report were taken in April, a typically dry month. Exhibit C-180, Cattaneo Report, pp. 4-5.\n\n*See e.g.* First Hunte Report, p. 5.\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 18: \"In periods of drought, the Sanctuary pumps freshwater from the springs to assist with hydration. Such pumping occurred during the monitoring event.\"\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 18.\n\nSecond EEC Report, p. 7: \"The pump was reported by Ryan Chenery to deliver about 5-7 gallons per minute of water...The lake, trays and ponds comprise about 12 acres of water. The lake is about 8 acres of the total. This small pump definitely could not be accused of turning the lake system into a freshwater system.\" *See also* Chenery Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 37-40; Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 479:10-480:20 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery).\n\n96.\n\nIt therefore appears to the Tribunal that salinity levels at the Sanctuary decreased in the period spanning 1986 to 2015, but the question of whether this change occurred during the Relevant Period is left open.\n\n97.\n\nThe data from the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme, the 2010 EEC Report and CARICOMP must be examined more closely to answer the latter question. Both EEC and Professor Hunte appear to accept the data from the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme as reliable. The Tribunal has already noted that the data from the 2010 EEC Report cannot be explained away based on the pumping of fresh water into the Sanctuary. As regards the CARICOMP data, the Tribunal accepts the criticism made by EEC that they are presented \"as a graph with no information on sample location, depth or month of the year.\"132 The Tribunal would have preferred for the CARICOMP data to be better documented; nonetheless, the CARICOMP data correlates with the salinity values obtained by EEC in February 2010. Professor Hunte's indication that CARICOMP tested the surface of the lake133 to collect \"at least ten samples per time period\"134 suggests that seasonal variation was not overlooked. Taking account of all of these factors, the Tribunal is of the view that the CARICOMP data may also be relied upon.\n\nSupplementary Wallace Report, p. 2.\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 4.\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1211:23 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\n98.\n\nTo establish that the decline in salinity occurred during the Relevant Period, EEC compares the average salinity value measured in the lake and south pond in April 2002 (8.4 ppt) with the average value measured in the lake and south pond in February 2010 (1.9 ppt).135 However, while this comparison is adequate from the perspective of seasonal variation, as both April 2002 and February 2010 were dry months, the Tribunal finds this comparison inconclusive for other reasons.\n\nFirst EEC Report, \u00b6 43, referring to Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 55.\n\n99.\n\nFirst, in addition to seasonal variation, the data from the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme and CARICOMP suggest that there is inter-annual variation in salinity levels at the Sanctuary. The reports from the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme conclude that there was \"statistically significant\" variation in levels of salinity between the 2000 to 2001, and the 2002 to 2003, investigation periods.136 The CARICOMP data similarly display inter-annual variation; for example, with average values of 1.7 ppt for 2006, 7.7 ppt for 2008 and 1.0 ppt for 2010. As a result of this inter-annual variation, a comparison of data collected at discrete moments in time cannot serve to show a trend.\n\nGraeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Water Quality Monitoring Programme, Report No. 2, April 2002-March 2003, filed as Annex B to First Hunte Report, pp. 10-11.\n\n100.\n\nSecond, salinity values were generally higher during the 2002-2003 investigation period, chosen by EEC for its comparison, than during the 2000-2001 investigation period.137 For the same locations in the lake and south pond, the average salinity value in drier months of the 2000-2001 period (February to April) was not 8.4 ppt, but only 4.6 ppt.138\n\nGraeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Water Quality Monitoring Programme, Report No. 2, April 2002-March 2003, filed as Annex B to First Hunte Report, p. 11.\n\nExhibit C-221, Attachment 16A to 2010 EEC Report.\n\n101.\n\nThird, the Tribunal observes that all the salinity values for the years from 2005 to 2015 recorded by both EEC and CARICOMP fall well within the range of values measured in the context of the 20012003 Monitoring Programme.\n\n102.\n\nIn summary, in its consideration of the available evidence, the Tribunal concludes that although salinity levels at the Sanctuary decreased over the full period for which data is available from 1986 to 2015, the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that this change occurred during the Relevant Period.\n\n103.\n\nAs to the question of whether, by 2009, the Sanctuary waters could be said to have become entirely fresh or so fresh as to harm the mangrove ecosystem, the actual impact of the Sanctuary's salinity levels on the mangrove ecosystem is discussed in Subsections (iii)-(v) below.\n\n*(ii) Other water quality parameters*\n-------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nTwo sets of data for water quality parameters other than salinity are available for the Sanctuary, namely:\n\n(i) data collected in the context of the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme;139 and\n\n(ii) data collected by EEC in February 2010.140\n\nExhibit C-67, Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Water Quality Monitoring Programme, Report for the Period October 2000-October 2001; Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Water Quality Monitoring Programme, Report No. 2, April 2002-March 2003, filed as Annex B to First Hunte Report. *See also* Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1122-1125 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report.\n\n105.\n\nOn each occasion, the water bodies of the Sanctuary were tested for levels of dissolved oxygen, where higher levels indicate better water quality, as well as biological oxygen demand and levels of heavy metals, ammonia, nitrate, phosphate, phosphorus, suspended solids, faecal coliform and faecal streptococci, where lower values indicate better water quality.141\n\n*See* Second Hunte Report, pp. 8-10.\n\n106.\n\nIn their analysis of the data, the Parties' respective environmental experts draw contrary conclusions: EEC find that water quality declined \"on a number of important parameters,\"142 whilst Professor Hunte asserts that water quality improved \"for all indicators measured.\"143\n\nSecond EEC Report, p. 14. EEC indicates that there was an increase in the levels of ammonia, nitrate, TSS, phosphorus, copper, iron, zinc as well as a decline in dissolved oxygen. EEC also points to an increase in the levels of faecal coliform and streptococci at some locations. Second EEC Report, pp. 14-16.\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 10.\n\n107.\n\nThese contrary conclusions appear to arise from the experts' choices in the selection of data for comparison. EEC compared data collected at six sampling stations located in the Sanctuary lake and south pond in February 2010, a month of low rainfall, with data collected at similar locations in the drier months of the period 2001-2003 (*i.e.*, February to April 2001 and April 2002).144 In contrast, Professor Hunte compared data collected at two sampling stations in the lake in February 2010 with data collected at similar locations during the entire investigation period of April 2002 to March 2003145 or, alternatively, with data from February 2003.146\n\nHearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 986:18-23 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace); Exhibit C-221, Appendix 16 to 2010 EEC Report.\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 8.\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 8; Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1238-1240 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\n108.\n\nAt the Hearing, Mr. Wallace (speaking to the EEC reports) and Professor Hunte defended their respective methodologies. They agreed that, as with water salinity, there is seasonal variation in the other parameters of water quality,147 as supported by the outcome of the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme.148 However, they disagreed as to the factors causing the agreed seasonal variation: Mr. Wallace insisted on the importance of rainfall (which increases the natural run-off of water, and therefore contaminants, biological waste and detritus, from the entire catchment area).149 Professor Hunte suggested that there may be other factors of seasonal variation, such as temperature and the \"degree of groundwater discharge into the lake.\"150 On this issue, the Tribunal notes that, unlike the case of water salinity, the reports of the 2001-2003 Monitoring Programme do not state a clear conclusion regarding the impact of rainfall as a factor of seasonal variation.\n\nHearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 987-989 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace); Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1237:4-17 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\nExhibit C-67, Graeme Hall Nature Sanctuary Water Quality Monitoring Programme, Report for the Period October 2000-October 2001, p. 3: \"Most water quality parameters measured in the Graeme Hall swamp area appeared to differ between months.\"\n\nHearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 987:24-989:4 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace).\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1239:13-19 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\n109.\n\nIn all the circumstances, on this issue as to the seasonal variation in the parameters of water quality, the Tribunal concludes that the precise factors are not well known or understood and remain contested to the extent that no clear finding may be made. On any view, it is apparent that data collected in a single sampling event of February 2010 does not provide sufficient information for conclusions to be drawn regarding the evolution of water quality at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period. Additionally, the fact that different methodologies yield different and opposing trends suggests to the Tribunal that, as likely as not, any changes that may have occurred in the water quality of the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period are within the bounds of seasonal variation.\n\n110.\n\nIn summary on this issue, given the differences in approach of the experts and the insufficiency of available data, the Claimant has failed to discharge his burden of proof to establish that there was a decline in the parameters of water quality (other than salinity) at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period.\n\n111.\n\nThe Claimant separately claims that the severity of environmental issues such as \"bad odours\" and \"stagnant water,\" which existed before he purchased the Sanctuary grounds,151 increased during the Relevant Period.152 However, the evidence for this is anecdotal and, wholly apart from the question of causality, does not support any finding that these issues worsened with time.\n\n*See e.g.* Exhibit C-180, Cattaneo Report, 1987, p. 14: \"It is this which gives the water its tea-coloured stain. Such discoloration is entirely natural. It is derived from breakdown products of leaf litter. In general the water of mangals is typically very hard and brown\"; p. 22: \"[T]here was a distinct odor of rotten eggs about the swamp at dawn on April 11. This gas likely results from decomposition in the mud and trays of the swamp surrounding the lake and is indicative of intense biological activity. It is not an indication of unnatural pollution.\"\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 76; Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1439:2-4, 1660:2-16 (Claimant's closing statement).\n\n*(iii) Health of the mangroves*\n-------------------------------\n\n112.\n\nOn the contested issue of decline in the mangroves' health during the Relevant Period, the Tribunal has been presented with:\n\n(i) the testimony of Mr. Chenery that, between 2004 and 2009, he \"observed red spots beginning to develop on the leaves of the mangrove trees\" and \"noted that the leaves began taking on a greyish tinge\";153\n\n(ii) the observation of Mr. Angelo Tulmieri, the scientist employed by EEC to assess the health of the mangroves in February 2010, that they were \"verdant and healthy\" and that \"the gaps in the canopy appeared to be small and few in number\";154\n\n(iii) the testimony of Professor Hunte that the mangroves looked healthy when he last visited the Sanctuary in 2008;155 and\n\n(iv) the tender of the 2015 Photograph, taken by Mr. Ries shortly before the Hearing, as establishing yellowing of the mangrove leaves.156\n\nChenery Statement, \u00b6 26. *See also* Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 529:23-25 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery): \"... the mangroves, looked stressed.

Ries of Scheda Ecological Associates Inc., restated and confirmed this assessment in their expert reports.161 EEC and Mr. Ries further explained that regular tidal exchange is a key element to ensuring the mangroves' competitive advantage.162 Professor Hunte also agreed that mangroves lose their competitive advantage in fresh water.163\n\nExhibit C-217, Attachment 11 to 2010 EEC Report, Mangrove Quality Assessment by Angelo Tulmieri, p. 11 of the PDF.\n\nExhibit C-217, Attachment 11 to 2010 EEC Report, Mangrove Quality Assessment by Angelo Tulmieri, p. 26 of the PDF.\n\nExhibit C-217, Attachment 11 to 2010 EEC Report, Mangrove Quality Assessment by Angelo Tulmieri, p. 26 of the PDF.\n\nFirst EEC Report, \u00b6\u00b6 21, 63; Scheda Report, pp. 7-9. *See also* Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, pp. 16, 21-22; Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015; 70:7-14 (Claimant's opening statement).\n\nScheda Report, p. 7: \"The importance of tidal fluctuations for mangroves can be described in the following way: tidal stress (alternate wetting and drying), in combination with salinity, helps exclude most other vascular plants and thus reduces competition...\"; Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 1020:15-22 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace):  \n Wet mangroves in particular require inundation and water level. They cannot stand in [the] same water level for very long periods of time, and that puts a stress on the system. And permanent inundation in mangrove systems is a number one of the primary reasons in the world why mangroves have massive dieoffs, [there are] many reports that show that.\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1138:7-11 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\n115.\n\nOn this issue, on which all the experts appear to agree, the Tribunal accepts that in fresh water (and in the absence of regular tides), mangroves may eventually be outcompeted by fresh water species. However, here the Claimant has not demonstrated the fact of any such fresh water transformation of the Sanctuary over the Relevant Period. That the damage to the mangroves contemplated by this theory lies in the future was accepted both by Mr. Allard and his environmental experts.164 On no view has the Claimant established that the danger of mangrove extinction was imminent at the time of the Sanctuary's closure in 2009. Six years later, whilst testifying that \"we will start seeing death in the system,\"165 Mr. Ries could only point to the yellowing of leaves as a first sign of stress.166 He recognized that he cannot predict how long the mangroves will survive if current conditions persist,167 and agreed that it could be over ten years.168 Similarly, Mr. Tulmieri wrote in his 2010 report that \"[t]he conversion from a brackish mangrove wetland to a freshwater wetland in which freshwater plants replace mangroves may take a long time.\"169\n\nHearing Tr., 9 December 2015, 284:1-13 (examination of Mr. Peter A. Allard); Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 995:1-12 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace); Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1082:8-1083:2 (examination of Mr. Thomas F.

The Tribunal notes that Dr. Lorna Inniss also visited the Sanctuary in 2015 and testified at the Hearing that the \"mangroves seemed extremely healthy\" (Hearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 800:24). However, like Mr. Chenery, Dr. Inniss does not appear to be an expert in mangroves.\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1093-1095 (examination of Mr. Thomas F. Ries).\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1094:10-15 (examination of Mr. Thomas F. Ries).\n\nExhibit C-217, Attachment 11 to 2010 EEC Report, Mangrove Quality Assessment by Angelo Tulmieri, p. 11 of the PDF.\n\n116.\n\nFindings as to the decline in the health of the mangroves over the Relevant Period cannot be inferred from consideration of the 2015 Photograph taken six years later.\n\n117.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not established that the health of the mangroves deteriorated during the Relevant Period to such an extent as to render the Sanctuary's operation as an ecotourism attraction impossible or financially unsustainable.\n\n*(iv) Diversity and health of fish*\n-----------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that, during the Relevant Period, the number of fish species at the Sanctuary declined and fish kills became more frequent.170 EEC links the decline in fish diversity to the alleged freshwater transformation of the Sanctuary and the upsurge of fish kills to the alleged accumulation of pollutants in its waters.171\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 76(c); Reply, \u00b6 62; Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1510:23-25, 1660:5-10 (Claimant's closing statement).\n\nSecond EEC Report, pp. 13-14, 17.\n\n119.\n\nTo establish the decline in fish species, EEC compares the fish species count of the 1987 Cattaneo Report, which identified nine marine and nine fresh water species, with counts by Mr. Chenery over the period 2005 to 2009, during which he identified only three marine and eight fresh water species.172 The Claimant also relies on the report by Dr. Karl Watson, an early collaborator on the Sanctuary project, that 42 species of fish were catalogued at the Sanctuary before 1996.173\n\nSecond EEC Report, p. 13, referring to Exhibits C-180, Cattaneo Report; C-169, Summary of aquatic species prepared by Mr. Ryan Chenery. *See also* Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 1021 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace); Exhibit C-170, Mr. Ryan Chenery's fish count records.\n\nReply, \u00b6 62.\n\n120.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, Dr. Watson's statement about fish is unsupported and, indeed, contradicted by other evidence. He states that 42 fish species were identified by a Dr. Robin Mahon, whom Mr. Allard engaged to \"conduct a survey of the fish population... as part of the preparation for the submission of the government required Environmental Impact Assessment.\"174 Yet Mr. Allard's two environmental management plans make no reference to Dr. Mahon, while the Amended EMP identifies only 21 fish species.175\n\nWatson Statement, \u00b6 11.\n\nExhibit C-44, Amended EMP, p. 28.\n\n121.\n\nMoreover, the very different survey methods used prevent any meaningful comparison between the fish species counts produced by the authors of the Cattaneo Report and Mr. Chenery. For the Cattaneo Report, fish \"were collected by seine, dip net and minnow trap from the margins of the lake as well as the sedge marsh and the mangrove swamp.\"176 Of the 18 fish species identified, only one was found through visual sighting.177 By contrast, Mr. Chenery relied solely on visual reconnaissance, in the context of frequent walks through the Sanctuary during which he was also preoccupied with identifying other fauna and flora and, moreover, was sometimes accompanied by tourists.178 At the Hearing, Mr. Wallace agreed, with respect to the methods used by the authors of the Cattaneo Report and Mr. Chenery, that \"[t]here is a difference and [that] if you were doing statistical analysis, they wouldn't hold up,\" explaining that \"[y]ou would want to do the same methodology, if you want[ed] to compare over time.\"179\n\nExhibit C-180, Cattaneo Report, p. 27.\n\nExhibit C-180, Cattaneo Report, p. 28. *See also* Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 1037:11-14 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace).\n\nHearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 519-520, 524 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery).\n\nHearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 1038:3-18 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace).\n\n122.\n\nIn any event, even if the Cattaneo Report's and Mr. Chenery's fish species counts could be meaningfully compared, they could not suffice to show that any decline in fish diversity occurred between 1996 and 2010, rather than between 1987 and 1996.\n\n123.\n\nWith regard to the fish kills, it is common ground between the Parties that they occasionally occurred before Mr. Allard purchased the Sanctuary.180 The experts agree that fish kills may occur in the absence of any toxic compounds in the water, arising from oxygen depletion, usually when storm water run-off carrying large amounts of organic debris increases the oxygen demand of the water column.181 There is no evidence here that fish kills resulted from the release of any toxic compounds in the water. The laboratory testing of dead tilapia carried out for the 2010 EEC Report showed that they \"appeared to be in good health\" despite some minor, non-lethal health issues,182 and the 2010 EEC Report identified oxygen depletion as \"the most likely explanation of fish kills,\"183 a conclusion in which Professor Hunte concurs.184 The only exception is that a fish kill anecdotally is reported to have followed the 2005 sewage spill.185 However, as discussed below, this spill had no lasting effect on the Sanctuary186 and accordingly could not be characterised as part of a continuing trend of increasing fish mortality arising from toxicity.\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 94:2-3 (Respondent's opening statement); Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 201:710 (examination of Mr. Peter A. Allard): \"I heard here were some occasional fish kills, yes.\" *See also* Exhibit C-180, Cattaneo Report, April 1987, p. 4, referring to \"past massive fishkills in the pond.\"\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 47; First EEC Report, \u00b6 55; First Hunte Report, p. 6.\n\nExhibit C-225, Attachment 20 to 2010 EEC Report, University of Florida, Tilapia and Crab Analysis, 30 March 2010.\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 47.\n\nFirst Hunte Report, p. 6.\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 45: \"Fish kills also were reported anecdotally in association with a massive untreated wastewater release into the Graeme Hall Wetland in July 2005.\"\n\n*See* paragraph 145 below.\n\n124.\n\nThe Claimant has also failed to establish that fish kills became more frequent during the Relevant Period arising from any increase in the frequency and severity of oxygen depletion episodes (as resulting, according to EEC, from the accumulation of debris from storm water run-off caused by the infrequent operation of the Sluice Gate).187\n\nEEC summarizes the disagreement as follows:  \n With no outlet to the sea to allow flushing, and a growing muck layer on the bottom which restricts water flow, the suspended solids accumulate. Prof. Hunte sees this as a natural event and not related to pollution. Due to the lack of flushing, we see this as a continual pollutant load that unnaturally accumulates each year. Poor circulation in the absence of tidal flushing contributes to the low [dissolved oxygen]. The relationship between high volumes of stormwater runoff and entrained pollutant that cause water degradation is a primary factor in fish kills.  \n Second EEC Report, p. 17.\n\n125.\n\nIndeed, EEC relies upon records of fish found dead kept by Mr. Stuart Heaslet, a consultant and employee of the Sanctuary, and Mr. Chenery.188 However, the records appear to cover only the years 2000 to 2001 and 2006 to 2009. The largest fish kill (3,000 fish) occurred in 2001, most likely as a one-off event resulting from works carried out by the Ministry of Transport and Public Works. The records also show that, although the second largest fish kill occurred in 2008 with 200 dead fish, more fish were found dead in 2000 (184) than in 2006 (88), 2007 (110) or 2009 (50). Hence, the records do not show an increase, let alone a significant and constant increase, in the number of fish kills over the Relevant Period.\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 24; Exhibit C-224, Attachment 19 to 2010 EEC Report, \"GHNS Biological Report Comments Regarding Fishkill Events 2000-2003 and Ryan Chenery Log of Fishkills 2006-2009.\"\n\n126.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has not established that there was either a decline in the numbers of fish species or an increase in the frequency of fish kills at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period.\n\n*(v) Diversity and number of birds*\n-----------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that there was a steady decline in bird species and population at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period.189 EEC supports this assertion, first, by comparing the number of bird species referred to in the 2005 designation of the Graeme Hall Swamp under the *Convention on* *Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl Habitat* (\"**RAMSAR Convention**\") (84) with the number of bird species observed by Mr. Chenery at the Sanctuary from 8 to 13 February 2010 (37) and, second, by noting a decline in the number of bird species observed by Mr. Chenery between 2005 and 2009.190 The Claimant's estimate of the decline in the bird population also is based on Mr. Chenery's observations.191\n\nReply, \u00b6 62(d).\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 21; First EEC Report, \u00b6 19; Second EEC Report, p. 13; Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 1000; 1023:17-25 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace). *See also* Exhibit C-211, RAMSAR designation, 2005; Chenery Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 33-35.\n\nReply, \u00b6 62(d). *See also* Chenery Statement, \u00b6 36, referring to Exhibit C-171, Avian Census Report.\n\n128.\n\nWith respect to EEC's first comparison, in the absence of any information concerning the source or sources of the bird species count of the RAMSAR designation, the Tribunal is left to assume that this count includes *all* of the species reported to have been observed, whether during systematic surveys, or in individual sightings by bird enthusiasts, over a lengthy period, perhaps running back to when the Sanctuary was operated as a shooting swamp and measures were being taken to attract wading birds.192 On no view, may any such total count of birds ever observed in the Graeme Hall Swamp be meaningfully compared to the number of birds observed by Mr. Chenery in the Sanctuary within six days in February 2010.\n\nAs explained in Exhibit C-43, First EMP, p. 9, the Sanctuary may have become less attractive to certain species of birds after organized shooting ceased in the early 1970s due to changes in the design of the area.\n\n129.\n\nWith respect to EEC's second comparison, Mr. Chenery's records for 2009 are to be disregarded, as data was collected only until the end of March.193 For the earlier years, Mr. Chenery states that, by walking through the Sanctuary, he observed 45 species in 2005, 44 in 2006, 35 in 2007 and 30 in 2008.194 However, he only recorded sightings of uncommon breeding residents and migratory birds, excluding common breeding residents;195 in other words, sightings of birds \"that visitors pay money to go see at the Sanctuary.\"196 In differentiating common and uncommon breeding residents, Mr. Chenery must have exercised a degree of subjective judgment that makes comparisons with earlier reported populations almost meaningless.\n\nHearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 494:17-19 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery).\n\nChenery Statement, \u00b6 35.\n\nHearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 438:9-439:6 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery).\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1508:13-14 (Claimant's closing statement).\n\n130.\n\nEven if a comparison of Mr. Chenery's own annual records is essayed, its reliability is uncertain. Professor Hunte suggested that the decreasing number of bird sightings by Mr. Chenery between 2004 and 2008 may be explained by the fact that Mr. Chenery took fewer bird walks in later years.197 At the Hearing, Mr. Chenery confirmed that his records do not distinguish between days on which he went on a bird walk, but did not see any birds, and days when he did not go on a bird walk.198 Mr. Chenery also explained that, in general, the frequency of his bird walks did not vary from year to year: he would usually walk the same route through the Sanctuary twice a day, five or six days a week, with limited exceptions.199\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 15.\n\nHearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 490:7-14 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery).\n\nHearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 490:14-25 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery).\n\n131.\n\nMr. Chenery also explained that, although he conducted bird walks every single month during the period 2005 to 2008, for purposes of comparison he used only six months for each year.200 By contrast, Professor Hunte, analysing Mr. Chenery's complete sighting notes for all twelve months of the year, calculated that Mr. Chenery had observed 48 species in 2005, 38 species in 2007, and 36 species in 2008.201 These figures were not challenged by the Claimant's environmental experts or by Mr. Chenery.202 While the Tribunal understands that Mr. Chenery limited his inquiry to six months each year so as to render possible a comparison with other years for which only incomplete data is available, it observes that Professor Hunte's figures suggest a less dramatic decline in bird species than those presented by Mr. Chenery.\n\nHearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 496 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery).\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 16.\n\n*See* Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 495-496:2 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery).\n\n132.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts Mr. Chenery to have been an honest and truthful witness; at the same time, the Tribunal is aware that it is at the mercy of Mr. Chenery's memory and that there is no way of telling whether Mr. Chenery took as many walks, or was as attentive, in later years as when he first started working at the Sanctuary.\n\n133.\n\nOverall, having examined the methodology following which Mr. Chenery's bird records were collected, the Tribunal concludes that it is not established that there was a decrease in bird diversity at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period. Nor do Mr. Chenery's records establish a decrease in the bird population. In any event, on no view did the Claimant establish a reduction in bird diversity and population such as to render the Sanctuary as an ecotourism attraction impossible or financially unsustainable to operate.\n\n*(vi) Health of crabs*\n----------------------\n\n134.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the health of crabs at the Sanctuary was also affected,203 based on Mr. Chenery's testimony that in 2009 he saw fewer fiddler crabs at the Sanctuary than previously and his record of one dead fiddler crab and 22 dead blue land crabs found at the Sanctuary between April and August 2009.204\n\nReply, \u00b6 62(b).\n\nChenery Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 27-31; Exhibit C-169, Attachment 19 to 2010 EEC Report, Summary of Aquatic Species prepared by Ryan Chenery, April-May 2009.\n\n135.\n\nEven accepting Mr. Chenery's observations made during a brief period in 2009, there is no basis to link any decline in these sightings to a pattern of environmental deterioration of the Sanctuary.\n\n136.\n\nAs to blue land crabs, the Tribunal is inclined to agree with Professor Hunte's opinion that \"[t]he reporting of blue crab kills in a single year is clearly not evidence of a decrease in number over time.\"205 Additionally, the Claimant has not shown that the blue land crab deaths were related to his grounds of complaint in this arbitration. Indeed, and to the contrary, the laboratory analysis of blue land crabs showed that they \"ha[d] no significant pathogens, lesions, or remarkable features.\"206\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p.14.\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 46. See also Exhibit C-225, Attachment 20 to 2010 EEC Report, University of Florida, Tilapia and Crab Analysis, 30 March 2010.\n\n137.\n\nThe Tribunal also cannot conclude from Mr. Chenery's impressions alone that the population of fiddler crabs decreased.\n\n138.\n\nIn any event, several theories have been suggested by the Parties' experts to explain a possible reduction of the fiddler crab population, including the lack of tidal exchange (which, in the Claimant's view, would suggest a link to the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate),207 predation208 and distributional changes,209 all of which are theoretically plausible causes for a result that has not been demonstrated. As the burden of proof lies on the Claimant, the Tribunal is unable to conclude that there was a decline or that a possible decline in the fiddler crab population arose from any environmental damage during the Relevant Period, wholly apart from the question of its cause.\n\nHearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 1020 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace).\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 15.\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 15.\n\n*(vii) Conclusion*\n------------------\n\n139.\n\nIn his first witness statement, Mr. Allard stated that the \"environmental degradation has been occurring slowly and [was] not always perceived by tourists,\" but that \"unless Barbados reverses its course of action, [this would] become readily apparent to most visitors.\"210 The Claimant has not established in these proceedings that the factual premises of this statement are correct. As detailed above, in respect of the six aspects of environmental health identified, namely water salinity, other parameters of water quality, the health of the mangroves, the diversity and health of fish, the diversity and number of birds, and the number of crabs, the Claimant falls short of establishing material deterioration during the Relevant Period, let alone to the extent that would be apparent to one-time visitors. It follows that the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to establish that his decision to cease operating the Sanctuary as an ecotourism attraction arose out of any relevant degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary.\n\nFirst Allard Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 60-61. *See also* Hearing Tr., 9 December 2015, 310-312 (examination of Mr. Peter A. Allard).\n\n**(b) Factual analysis - Causes of the alleged degradation**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n140.\n\nAs the Claimant fails to establish that there was a degradation of the identified features of the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period and that, as a consequence of such degradation, he incurred loss or damage, the case falls at the first factual hurdle. Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, and because the Parties made detailed submissions on the question of whether the alleged environmental degradation was caused by actions or inactions of Barbados, the Tribunal addresses these submissions here.\n\n141.\n\nIn the course of the arbitration, the Claimant has asserted that the following actions or inactions of Barbados caused the alleged degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary: (i) the failure to remedy the 2005 spill from the South Coast Sewage Plant;211 (ii) the Zoning Changes;212 and (iii) the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate.213 Each of these alleged causes of environmental degradation is addressed in turn below.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 72-74, 79.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 5, 81-85, 134; Reply, paras. 74-76, 87-90.\n\nStatement of Claim, paras. 4, 67, 76, 79, 135; Reply, paras. 6, 40-46, 51-60, 63-69; Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 37:5-6, 17-18, 38:7-9 (Claimant's opening statement).\n\n*(i) Sewage spill*\n------------------\n\n142.\n\nIn the Claimant's Statement of Claim, the 2005 sewage spill from the Barbados South Coast Sewage Plant was pleaded as a direct cause of environmental degradation during the Relevant Period, in that it \"had immediate negative effects on the Sanctuary's operations,\" which Barbados \"never remediated.\"214 This claim was reformulated during the Hearing in terms that:\n\nthe point about the South Coast Sewage Plant is as follows: If there is an emergency discharge from the South Coast Sewage Treatment Plant, that is supposed to go out the canal. If [the] sluice gate is blocked, as it was in 2005, that discharge can flow out of the canal and there will be some damage. Now, there's a dispute about how much damage there was. The relevance of the incident is as follows. It's not a claim that there was a spill in 2005, and that we're claiming for that spill [...]. The point is that that spill raised a red flag that made the need to repair the sluice gate urgent. It was a sign of what can happen if the sluice gate was not repaired.215\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 73.\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1656:19-1657:8 (Claimant's closing statement).\n\n143.\n\nEffectively, counsel thereby abandoned the separate head of claim, stating that the Claimant does not identify that any action or inaction of Barbados directly related to the 2005 spill caused the alleged degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period. Rather, the Claimant's closing position is that the 2005 spill illustrates the kind of damage that could be caused to the Sanctuary if the Sluice Gate were not repaired.\n\n144.\n\nIt follows that the Claimant's argument in respect of the 2005 spill is subsumed in his claim of alleged mismanagement of the Sluice Gate. Even in that context, the reformulation does not advance the claims as it is directed merely to the possibility of future harm that may (or may not) arise through mismanagement of the Sluice Gate.\n\n145.\n\nFurther, on its own terms, there is no more than anecdotal evidence of the deleterious effects of the 2005 spill. Mr. Heaslet's vague testimony regarding the spill's alleged negative impact216 and EEC's most improbable hypothesis that the spill could explain the discovery of dead gastropods at the Sanctuary seven years later in 2010217 fail when weighed against the fact that the water quality tests conducted at the instigation of the Barbados Water Authority within days of the spill failed to reveal any environmental damage.218\n\nHeaslet Statement, \u00b6 32: \"The pollution had immediate negative effects on the Sanctuary's operations. All environmental tours and educational operations were curtailed. In addition to the resulting stress on the ecosystem and its inhabitants, the Sanctuary staff dealt with complain[t]s about the smell and water discoloration.\"\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, pp. 51-52: \"Benthic sampling in February 2010 indicated that some \u2018sudden disturbance' had killed the gastropods in 8 of 10 locations, a finding consistent with the impact of [a sewage spill].\"\n\nExhibit R-79, Letter from Hugh Sealy, New Water Incorporated, to Barbados Water Authority, 9 September 2005: \"... no conclusion can be drawn in relation to the effect of the July [s]ewage spill, except that there was no discernible spatial or temporal impact of the sewage spill based upon the parameters measured.\"\n\n146.\n\nIt follows that the 2005 sewage spill does not explain any degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary or justify Mr. Allard's later closure of the Sanctuary in 2009.\n\n*(ii) Zoning Changes*\n---------------------\n\n147.\n\nThe claim is that damage caused by the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate \"will be compounded by new residential development that is due to occur\" in the area affected by the Zoning Changes.219\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 81.\n\n148.\n\nAs with the sewage spill, so expressed this head is merely impleaded to support Sluice Gate issues, and does not stand as a separate claim.\n\n149.\n\nSomewhat confusingly, the ground arising from the Zoning Changes provided for in the 2003 Plan is maintained as enabling future development that would have been prohibited under the 1986 Plan, and that necessarily will increase the run-off of contaminants into the Sanctuary.220\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 81-83; Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 73:13-25 (Claimant's opening statement); Hearing Tr., 18 December 2015, 1534:7-16 (Claimant's closing statement).\n\n150.\n\nAlthough the Respondent disputes that the adoption of the 2003 Plan diminished the environmental protection of the Sanctuary,221 it suffices to reject the claim on the ground that the Claimant has not demonstrated that the adoption of the 2003 Plan has caused any environmental damage to the Sanctuary. The Claimant has established neither that the quality of water at the Sanctuary decreased during the Relevant Period, nor that the flora and fauna of the Sanctuary suffered due to a decrease in water quality during that period.222 The Claimant has also not shown that any significant previously-prohibited development has been allowed in the vicinity of the Sanctuary after the adoption of the 2003 Plan. Indeed, Mr. Allard confirmed in his examination at the Hearing that the apprehended development has not yet taken place.223 Even if the Zoning Changes were to result in new development, there is no proof on the record that it would have the negative effects the Claimant alleges.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 167-173; Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1603:24-1604:7 (Respondent's closing statement).\n\n*See* paragraphs 104-139 above.\n\nHearing Tr., 9 December 2015, 281-283 (examination of Mr. Allard). *See also* Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1534:20-22 (Claimant's closing statement): \"We recognize that the amount of development that has occurred so far is limited, and that is what the record shows.\"\n\n151.\n\nIt follows that the Zoning Changes are untenable as grounds explaining any degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary or justifying closure of the Sanctuary in 2009 either on a stand-alone basis or in support of Sluice Gate issues.\n\n*(iii) The Sluice Gate*\n-----------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe claim is that Barbados' failure to adequately maintain and operate the Sluice Gate to allow the ingress of seawater and the egress of contaminants was the principal cause of the alleged environmental degradation at the Sanctuary.224\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 38:7-9 (Claimant's opening statement): \"It's trying to make it appear that any problems at the Sanctuary are due to anything other than the sluice gate.\"\n\n153.\n\nBased on the record of this arbitration, the Tribunal concludes that, before the mid-1990s, the Sluice Gate was opened three times per week. However, by 1997-1998, the Sluice Gate was opened less often due to the deterioration of its structure and the accretion of the beach, which required the frequent excavation of a channel between it and the sea.225 By October 2005, the Sluice Gate had become \"inoperable.\"226 It was jammed in a slightly open position, and blocked by an artificial sandbar, which could only be removed by severe storms or manually with the use of heavy machinery.227 There is evidence that the sandbar was removed by Government workers once in October 2005228 and again in August 2009.229 In summary, it appears that the Sluice Gate was opened irregularly between 1997 and 2004, and on no more than a handful of occasions between 2005 and 2009.\n\nExhibit C-56, First ARA Report, October 1997, pp. 4-4, 5-5:  \n The sluice gate used to be opened three times per week. [...] This schedule has not been regularly adhered to in recent years. In October 1996, responsible Ministries agreed that the sluice gate would be opened twice a week. [...] The sluice gate has historically been operated frequently [...]. This operational practice has become less and less frequent in recent years due to deterioration of the gate structure [...]. In addition, movement of sand along the beach rapidly books the canal between the sluice gate and the sea, and the sand buildup requires frequent and extensive excavation to provide proper flow.  \n Exhibit C-57, Second ARA Report, January 1998, p.11-6:  \n The channel structure and sluice gate is currently located on the beach well up from the normal high tide level [which] means that a channel must be regularly excavated through the sand to provide discharge flow to the sea. Chronic shortages of equipment or unavailability of equipment often means that the sluice gate is not operated in an acceptable manner [...].\n\nExhibit R-88, Letter from Harry Roberts to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Public Works, 5 October 2005: \"The condition of the sluice gate at Worthing beach continues to deteriorate; a portion of one of its supporting concrete columns has broken off and is now lying on the beach... the gate is now inoperable\"; Exhibit R-71, Minutes of the Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee meeting of 17 October 2005, 4 November 2005: \"[The Sluice Gate is] severely damaged\"; Exhibit R-89, Letter from Harry Roberts to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Public Works, 24 May 2006: \"The present Sluice Gate has... been repaired [since January 2004] but is still inoperable\"; Exhibit C-72, Draft Master Plan for the Graeme Hall Ecosystem, September 2007, p. 4: \"The effective operation of the sluice gate has been compromised by sand secretion and maintenance problems in the last few years, and is currently inoperable.\" *See also* Hearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 794 (examination of Dr. Lorna Inniss).\n\nChenery Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 9-10:  \n Due to lack of maintenance, the sluice gate does not function at all and remains closed, which prevents seawater from reaching the swamp [...]. [I]n order for a greater volume of water to flow through the sluice gate and into the canal, it is necessary for Government workers to scrape away the sand barrier that blocks the outside and inside of the sluice gate. Removing the sand barrier creates a small gap under the sluice gate for seawater to flow through during high tide;  \n Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 439-443 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery); Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 637-638 (examination of Mr. Steve Devonish). *See also* Exhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 11:  \n The sluice gate [...] has not been operational since 2006, when wooden components rotted to the point of failure [...]. Since 2006, the Government of Barbados has attempted to manage wetland water levels and allow flows within the Bisecting Canal by removing sand with a front end loader and backhoe.\n\nChenery Statement, \u00b6 11.\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 11.\n\n154.\n\nAt paragraph 102 above, the Tribunal found that salinity levels at the Sanctuary decreased from 1986 to 2015 (although there is no conclusive evidence that this change occurred during the Relevant Period). The question is therefore whether this decrease in salinity was caused by the irregular and infrequent operation of the Sluice Gate.\n\n155.\n\nIt is uncontroversial that the Sluice Gate is presently the sole overland connection between the Graeme Hall Swamp and the sea. The Claimant and his environmental experts submit that the Sluice Gate is accordingly the main (and, possibly, the only) way in which saline water enters the water bodies of the Sanctuary.230 In contrast, the Respondent argues that \"subsurface entry of saline water is by far the most significant way in which salt enters the [Sanctuary] lake.\"231 Professor Hunte explains that, even if the Sluice Gate had been regularly operated, it would have been ineffective in determining salinity in the Sanctuary lake, because starting in 1984-1987 the beach on which the Sluice Gate is located became too wide to permit the regular ingress of water.232\n\nReply, \u00b6 55-59; Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1434 & ff (Claimant's closing statement).\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1622:1-2 (Respondent's closing statement).\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. ii:  \nSandy Beach, which separates Graeme Hall [Swamp] from the sea, underwent significant accretion (beach widening) between 1984 and 2003, and its current width is still more than twice the width before the 1984 accretion. Since 1984, seawater at high tide has been unable to reach the sluice gate and therefore seawater could not have entered the Sanctuary lake through the sluice gate canal, except perhaps during extreme weather events at times when beach width was narrowest. Operation of the sluice gate would have been ineffective in determining salinity in the Graeme Hall Sanctuary lake since 1984.  \n*See also* Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1171-1174 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal does not exclude that, during the Relevant Period, seawater could reach the Sanctuary lake through the Sluice Gate if the latter was opened under the right conditions. Mr. Chenery and Mr. Heaslet both testified to seeing seawater enter the canal through the Sluice Gate in the period from 2000 to 2009, whether by flowing under the Sluice Gate when it was open or over it when it was closed.233 Mr. Chenery also testified to having seen what appeared to be the mixing of seawater with the waters of the lake,234 and Mr. Wallace provided a plausible explanation for how seawater entering through the Sluice Gate could flow sufficiently far up the canal to mix with the lake waters.235 It is also clear, however, that, due to the width of the beach during the Relevant Period, seawater did not reach the Sluice Gate on a daily basis. The Claimant submits that seawater could enter the lake during \"episodic periods of high tide,\"236 while the Respondent argues that this could only occur during \"extreme storm surges.\"237 When the beach was widest,238 in the mid-1990s, the First and Second ARA Reports noted that \"ocean waters could pass into the system\" through the Sluice Gate during periods of \"sufficiently high tide (primarily meteorological events combined with high astronomical tide),\" estimating the frequency of the mixing at five or six times a month.239\n\nChenery Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11; Hearing Tr., 9 December 2015, 381:7-10 (examination of Mr. Stuart Heaslet).\n\nChenery Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.\n\nHearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 858-862 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace).\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 53:13-16 (Claimant's opening statement): \"[T]he argument isn't that the tide always goes in and out on a daily basis. Rather that there's episodic periods of high tides and the like that can do that.\" *See also* Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 860:15-16 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace). \"... it's not implausible to me that [the seawater] could reach the lake and enter the lake.\"\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 116:3-6 (Respondent's opening statement): \"... the ecological paradise that Mr. Allard says he found in the 1990s did not allow water to enter into the lake through the sluice gate except in extreme storm surges.\" *See also* Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1167:15-1168:1 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte):  \n [...] in very rare circumstances of extreme weather events, such as, you know, you might have extreme spring tides that coincide with heavy onshore wave or wind action, that, you know\u2014certainly, a hurricane will give you some storm surge. So, there are situations in which, providing the beach is narrow enough\u2014right?\u2014that additional oceanographic and weather features could get it close to the sluice gate or near the sluice gate, and I've said that repeatedly. But those combination of events are going to be very rare.\n\n*See* Second Hunte Report, Appendix C, Graph of beach width measurements taken by the CZMU in the period 1984-2015.\n\nExhibit C-56, First ARA Report, October 1997, p. 5-1; Exhibit C-57, Second ARA Report, January 1998, p. 11-7.\n\n157.\n\nIn any event, the question here is not whether, on occasion, seawater would reach the Sanctuary lake through the Sluice Gate, but rather, whether the passage of seawater through the Sluice Gate was a significant component in maintaining the salinity of the Sanctuary lake, such that the irregular and infrequent operation of the Sluice Gate would cause a non-negligible decrease in salinity. In the Tribunal's view, the Claimant has failed to show that this is the case.\n\n158.\n\nFirst, while the Claimant contends that the Respondent and Professor Hunte created the theory that the lake's salinity is maintained through subsurface exchange \"solely for the purpose of this arbitration,\"240 the Tribunal finds ample support for this theory in documentation pre-dating the commencement of these proceedings:\n\n(i) The 1987 Cattaneo Report stated that \"[s]eawater, no doubt, intrudes into the swamp through the porous bar separating the sea from the lake and swamp area, and this would contribute to the high salinity of the [Sanctuary] lake...\"241\n\n(ii) The 1996 Barbados Water Drainage Study explained that, while the watershed area of the Graeme Hall Swamp has significantly reduced due to the constriction of the highway, \"the total inflow of water to the swamp has likely remained fairly constant due to sub-surface flow to the wetland area.\"242\n\n(iii) The First ARA Report of 1997 stated that \"[b]ore holes from Graeme Hall Swamp indicate that as the layer of coral extends outward under the sea, its permeability produces an interface between sea water infiltrating inland and fresh rainwater percolated through coral to the underlying oceanic deposits\"243 and that \"Graeme Hall Swamp... contains the hydrological attributes necessary to maintain a coastal wetland mangrove ecosystem with... adequate saline water from underground sources.\"244 It also stated that the results of water tests conducted in December 2016 were consistent with the conclusion that \"the primary mechanism providing saltwater to the swamp... was saltwater intrusion through porous geological formations separating the ocean and the swamp.\"245\n\n(iv) The Claimant's First EMP of 1998 referred to the \"upward welling of saltwater into the brackish lake from below.\"246\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1433, 1448-1451 (Claimant's closing statement).\n\nExhibit C-180, Cattaneo Report, p. 5.\n\nExhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Water Drainage Study, pp. 2-21, 2-22.\n\nExhibit C-56, First ARA Report, October 1997, 5-1.\n\nExhibit C-56, First ARA Report, October 1997, pp. 6-7, 6-8.\n\nExhibit C-56, First ARA Report, October 1997, pp. 5-8, 5-9.\n\nExhibit C-43, First EMP, p. 6.\n\n159.\n\nProfessor Hunte was also clearly aware of the function of subsurface exchange before preparing his expert reports in this arbitration. In his comments on the 2010 EEC Report, prepared for Barbados outside of this arbitration,247 Professor Hunte found it \"important to note that, in Barbados, most of the inland water that reaches the coastal zone does so as groundwater (underground) discharge rather than overland run-off, and that seawater intrusion inland can also occur underground during high tide.\"248\n\n*See* Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1129:3-12 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\nSecond Hunte Report, Appendix A, Professor Hunte's Comments on 2010 EEC Report, p. 1 (emphasis added).\n\n160.\n\nSecond, the Claimant was not able to disprove that subsurface exchange contributes to the salinity of the Sanctuary lake. His environmental experts, Messrs. Wallace and Ries, agreed during the Hearing that there is a subsurface flow of water from the sea to the Sanctuary when the tide is rising249 and that this could, at least theoretically, result in water exchange with the lake.250 Mr. Wallace further indicated that the only way of knowing whether the water that reaches the lake is saline or freshwater is \"to drill a hole and test it.\"251\n\nHearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 975 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace):  \n Well, I mean, it says \u2018it is likely that the inflow to the swamp will remain fairly constant due to subsurface flow.' There is no arguing that, that these\u2014the tides go up and down as they have and will continue to do, and that tide rising forces a wave underground inland. And then as the tide recedes, the wave comes back. [...] So, I don't disagree with the statement.\n\nHearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 1046:19-23 (examination of Mr. Thomas F. Ries): \"Q. [...] subsurface flow could account for some proportion of water exchange, albeit not a majority? A. That's a fair statement.\" Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 978:14-21 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace):  \n A. I believe that it's possible that water can come up and enter the lake if the conditions are right, but we haven't seen anything. The latest information from Professor Hunte showed that there was very low brackish water that might enter.  \n Q. But it is theoretically possible?  \n A. Yes. If the tide is high enough and the area is dry enough, the freshwater is dry enough, it could do that.\n\nHearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 976:11 (examination of Mr. Robert E. Wallace).\n\n161.\n\nYet the Claimant's environmental experts did not conduct such tests on the Sanctuary grounds. While EEC argued that any subsurface inflow of seawater could not affect the salinity of the lake due to the freshwater lens that typically lies above the area of subsurface saline-freshwater mixing,252 it did not show that such a lens exists under the Sanctuary. In this respect, the Tribunal notes that EEC itself indicated that \"the freshwater lens [is] above the saline-freshwater transition at all times except at ground surface adjacent to the ocean seawater \"253 and accepts Professor Hunte's explanation that \"[a]s the sub-surface freshwater (groundwater) approaches the sea, it rises closer to the surface and mixes with the sub-surface seawater, creating the brackish water that exists immediately below the surface at locations such as Graeme Hall [Swamp].\"254 In contrast to EEC, Professor Hunte was able to produce the CARICOMP data, which shows, on the basis of salinity measurements taken in bore holes dug at locations adjacent to the Sanctuary lake, that the salinity of the water below ground was consistently higher than the salinity of the lake surface in the period from 2006 to 2015.255\n\nSecond EEC Report, p. 4.\n\nSecond EEC Report, p. 4 (emphasis added).\n\nSecond Hunte Report, p. 12.\n\nSecond Hunte Report, Appendix B and pp. 4-5:  \n The [CARICOMP Monitoring] Programme not only monitors surface salinity in the lagoon [...], but also samples land sites immediately adjacent to the lagoon. Specifically, bore holes are dug in the ground until water is reached and salinity readings are taken of the water sampled. Throughout the Monitoring Programme, salinity values in this sub-surface water have consistently exceeded those in water samples from the lagoon [...].  \n*See also* Hearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1212, 1219 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\n162.\n\nThird, while, as noted in paragraph 93 above, the level of salinity of the Sanctuary waters was high in the mid-1980s, the record shows that, in all of the periods when the Sluice Gate was operational, it was primarily used to flush water *out* of the Graeme Hall Swamp and was therefore typically opened at low tide and closed in the presence of the conditions (whether simply high tides or high tides combined with extreme storm events) that might have brought water into the Sanctuary. From 1947 to 1970, the Sanctuary grounds belonged to a gun club,256 which operated the Sluice Gate to maintain constant water levels, presumably, to ensure that the water levels did not exceed those attractive to wading birds. The 2010 EEC Report thus indicates that in those days the Sluice Gate \"was opened only at low tide to control the water level in the shooting pools.\"257 Other documents indicate that, more recently, the Sluice Gate was typically opened at low tide, either to prevent flooding258 or to flush out debris.259 It is therefore unlikely that ingress of seawater through the Sluice Gate was a significant component to the maintenance of the salinity levels found in the mid-1980s.\n\nExhibit C-56, First ARA Report, October 1997, p. 3-2.\n\nExhibit C-73, 2010 EEC Report, p. 8.\n\nExhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study, p. 2.22: \"The gate is operated on an \u2018as required' basis in order to drain excess water from the swamp... Typically, the gates are opened at low tides...\"; Exhibit R-41, Letter from Baird & Associates to the CZMU, 5 May 2010: \"Baird completed a review of the operation of the [Sluice Gate] in 2004, and found that it was typically operated 10 to 15 times per month, reducing the water level in the impoundment by 100 to 150 mm on each opening\" (emphasis added); Exhibit C-56, First ARA Report, p. 4.4: \"The sluice gate used to be opened three times per week during low tide periods to allow floodwaters to drain to sea.\"\n\nExhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study, p. 2.22:  \n Historically, the outlet canal to the sea has frequently silted up and the poor maintenance and operation of the sluice gate lead to stagnation of the water in the swamp [...]. However, a major clean-up operation by the Ministry of Transport and Works in the mid 1980's (sic) and the regular operation of the sluice gate at low tides has resulted in better water quality.\n\n163.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that any differences between the Sanctuary and a natural mangrove ecosystem, as well as any general decline in salinity and the predominantly freshwater benthic community found in the Sanctuary lake by EEC, can in all likelihood be explained by the fact that Graeme Hall Swamp, formerly an open estuary, was cut off from the sea with the construction of the coastal road in 1715.260\n\nExhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study, p. 2.23\n\n164.\n\nAccordingly, even if the Tribunal had been persuaded that there was a degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period consisting of, or due to, a decrease in salinity (which it was not), it could not have concluded that such decrease was caused by the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate.\n\n165.\n\nAs to the Claimant's submission regarding the accumulation of contaminants in the Sanctuary waters due to the mismanagement of the Sluice Gate, the Tribunal admits the possibility that the prolonged closure of the Sluice Gate may cause a build-up of contaminants and, in particular, of large debris. Professor Hunte recognized during the Hearing that such debris would take time to break down, dissolve and be flushed out subsurface.261 However, as indicated in paragraphs 104-111 above, the Claimant has failed to demonstrate that there was an actual deterioration of the water quality at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period.\n\nHearing Tr., 15 December 2015, 1233:12-1234:5 (examination of Professor Wayne Hunte).\n\n*(iv) Conclusion*\n-----------------\n\n166.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that, even if it had found that there was a degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary during the Relevant Period (which it did not), it would not have been persuaded that such degradation was caused by any actions or inactions of Barbados.\n\n**B. ALLEGED BREACHES OF THE BIT**\n----------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the Claimant's claim fails at its factual threshold as the Claimant has failed to establish any loss or damage to his investment attributable to any actions or inactions of Barbados. Even if the Tribunal were to find that Barbados breached any of its BIT obligations, there would therefore be no loss or damage arising from such breach. However, and having regard to the exhaustive compilation of the Parties' pleadings and the joinder of issue, the Tribunal regards it as appropriate to address the breaches alleged.\n\n168.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal turns to consider the Claimant's claims of breach by Barbados of various obligations arising under the BIT as noted in paragraph 51 above, namely breaches of the FET and FPS standards, as well as of the obligation not to expropriate the Claimant's investment except in accordance with the conditions set out in the BIT.\n\n**1. FET**\n----------\n\n169.\n\nArticle II(2) of the BIT relevantly provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall accord investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party:\n\n(a) fair and equitable treatment in accordance with the principles of International Law [...]\n\n**(a) The Claimant's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nReferring to other earlier investment treaty decisions, the Claimant asserts that Article II(2)(a) of the BIT protects \"the investor's reasonable expectations arising from the commitments of the host [S]tate.\"262 A violation of such expectations occurs \"where officials of the Respondent [S]tate have made representations to the investor that the investor relied upon to his detriment\" and amounts to a breach of the FET standard.263\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 111-114, referring to *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales TECMED SA v.

In the short term, however, the area of the sluice gate is the property of the Government of Barbados. Seen from a legal perspective, including that of responsibility in case of accident or mishap, [GHNSI] does not have the authority to intervene in the operation of the sluice gate, and indeed it would be trespassing should it attempt to do so.281\n\n(ii) In its Amended EMP, GHNSI similarly offered to cooperate with Barbados, while emphasizing that the latter would \"retain ultimate responsibility for sluice gate management.\"282 The Amended EMP also indicated that Barbados' \"drainage study condition\" for the project was fulfilled through the 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study.283\n\n(iii) Barbados gave its unconditional approval to the Amended EMP, including its proposals regarding drainage and responsibility for the Sluice Gate, through letters dated 12 September and 27 November 2000 from the Town and Country Planning Office.284 The 12 September letter indicated that, \"subsequent to the approval of the drainage and storm water management plan..., the relevant conditions attached to the granting of the planning permission may be deemed to have been satisfactorily discharged.\"285 The 27 November letter confirmed the satisfaction of all conditions.286 GHNSI accordingly reported in a letter dated 19 March 2001 to the Chief Town Planner that it had \"adequately fulfilled the obligations for planning permission that related to drainage and storm water management\"287 and the Chief Town Planner did not dispute this at the time.288\n\n(iv) Prior to issuing his approval, the Chief Town Planner also consulted the Coastal Zone Management Unit of the Ministry of the Environment (\"**CZMU**\"), which reported, in a memorandum dated 16 June 2000, that \"it is the government's responsibility to ensure acceptable water quality.\"289\n\nReply, \u00b6 19; Statement of Claim, \u00b6 39. *See also* Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 57:10-20 (Claimant's opening statement).\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 40, *quoting* Exhibit C-43, First EMP, p. 18, s. 3.4.\n\nReply, \u00b6 23, referring to Exhibit C-43, First EMP.\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25, referring to Exhibit C-44, Amended EMP.\n\nReply, \u00b6 25, referring to Exhibit C-44, Amended EMP. *See also* Exhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study; Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 62:5-14 (Claimant's opening statement).\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 26-31.\n\nReply, \u00b6 27, *quoting* Exhibit C-39.\n\nReply, \u00b6 28, referring to Exhibit C-40.\n\nReply, \u00b6 33, referring to Exhibit C-172.\n\nHearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 584:25-585:12 (examination of Mr. Mark Cummins).\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 44-45, *quoting* Exhibit C-47.\n\n176.\n\nThe Claimant draws these circumstances together to claim that he had a legitimate and reasonable expectation within the FET obligation that Barbados would adequately maintain and operate the Sluice Gate, and keep the \"buffer zone\" around the Graeme Hall Swamp \"regardless of other amendments that might be introduced in a future version\" of the 1986 Plan.290 He asserts that the public hearings that took place before the release of the formal 2003 Plan \"gave no indication of the elimination of the [\"buffer zone\"].\"291\n\nReply, \u00b6 81.\n\nReply, \u00b6 83, referring to Exhibit C-176.\n\n177.\n\nThe Claimant invokes also Article 31(3)(c) of the *Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties*,292 which provides that in the interpretation of a treaty \"there shall be taken into account, together with the context... any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relation between the parties.\" The Claimant argues that, in \"interpreting the scope of the standards of treatment,\" the Tribunal should consider \"the obligations with respect to the Sanctuary that Barbados assumed in its environmental treaties.\"293 The Claimant emphasizes that he does not allege a breach of any treaties other than the BIT, but argues that Barbados' environmental treaty obligations \"confirm the reasonableness of.

Lithuania*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/8, Award, 11 September 2007, \u00b6 333.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 89. *See also* Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 91:4-92:12 (Respondent's opening statement).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 90, referring to Watson Statement, \u00b6 20.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 95-101.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 102-106, referring to Inniss Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 8-12.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n192.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, the question the Respondent has raised of whether the FET standard contained in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT constitutes an autonomous treaty standard having its own content or corresponds to the minimum standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law329 is not material for the outcome of the case.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 251-253; Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1624:21-25; 1625:8-16; 1625:22-1626:2 (Respondent's closing statement).\n\n193.\n\nThis is because the entire claim under Article II(2)(a) is based on the notion that the FET standard protects an investor's legitimate expectations arising from representations made by the host State. Whether Article II(2)(a) creates an autonomous FET standard or corresponds to the minimum standard of treatment, in each case it includes the protection of an investor's legitimate expectations arising from a host State's representations, under certain conditions.\n\n194.\n\nAssuming that Mr. Allard's construction of Article II(2)(a) is correct, three factual cumulative conditions present themselves: (i) was there a specific representation?; (ii) did the investor rely on it, *i.e.*, was it critical to his making of the investment?; and (iii) was the investor's reliance reasonable? The Tribunal examines the first two of these three questions below; as will be seen, in this case there is no need to examine the third.\n\n*(i) Whether Barbados made any specific representations*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n195.\n\nThe representations of Barbados relied upon by the Claimant fall into the two broad categories of:\n\n(1) representations by which Barbados allegedly undertook to generally protect the environment at the Sanctuary; and\n\n(2) representations by which Barbados allegedly undertook to manage the Sluice Gate.\n\n196.\n\n*As to (1), representations regarding general environmental protection* : The Claimant's claims are based on representations made by Barbados purportedly giving rise to reasonable expectations that Barbados would \"uphold its environmental policies, particularly those that reflected a commitment to conservation and protection of the biodiversity of the Sanctuary.\"330 In particular, Mr. Allard asserts that he reasonably expected that the Respondent would not eliminate the \"buffer zone\" existing under the 1986 Plan.331\n\nClaimant's Skeleton Argument, \u00b6 54.\n\nReply, \u00b6 81.\n\n197.\n\nThe Claimant invokes the specific and direct representations of Barbados on which he bases these expectations as comprising:\n\n(i) the 1986 Plan;\n\n(ii) the 1995 Cummins Letter;\n\n(iii) a series of events that occurred in 1996, *i.e.*, a reply letter from the Barbados Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs and the then Deputy Prime Minister's statements during a meeting;\n\n(iv) the First and Second ARA Reports of 1997 and 1998; and\n\n(v) a letter from the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Physical Development of 2002.332\n\n*See* paragraph 173 above.\n\n198.\n\nThe Claimant adds that Barbados' environmental treaty obligations confirmed and reinforced the specific representations made by Barbados to Mr. Allard.333\n\nStatement of Claim *,* \u00b6\u00b6 123-124, referring to the *Convention on Biological Diversity* and *the Ramsar Convention.*\n\n199.\n\nOn this issue, the Tribunal concludes to the contrary. On a fair reading, none of the statements relied upon by the Claimant are amenable to characterisation as a specific representation capable of creating a legitimate expectation on the part of Mr. Allard that Barbados would take any specific steps with regard to the environmental protection of the Sanctuary. The terms and context of these statements do not suffice to support the expression of an intention to create an obligation for the State. Nor is each reasonably amenable to be interpreted by an investor to create such an obligation.\n\n200.\n\nPlainly, the 1986 Plan was a general expression of Barbados' policy with respect to the patterning of land use and physical development on the island, including an \"intention to protect areas of special vegetation including... Graeme Hall [Swamp].\"334 It \"designate[d] Graeme Hall Swamp as an area for major recreational activity and/or open space,\"335 but did not express any position that Barbados' general policy of protection of areas of special vegetation would always be achieved through this designation. The 1986 Plan, in itself, was insufficiently specific to give rise to any legitimate expectation that its land designation would not be amended. As a matter of general approach, such planning regulations of an administrative nature are not shielded from subsequent changes under domestic law.336 But the critical point is that the Claimant is unable to point to any other specific statement by Barbados to the effect that the 1986 Plan would not be amended at all or in its part material to the environmental protection of Graeme Hall Swamp.337 The 1986 Plan was brought to the attention of the Claimant by the 1995 Cummins Letter for information purposes only, without containing any commitments.338\n\nExhibit C-29, 1986 Plan, \u00b6 7.7.\n\nExhibit C-27.1995 Cummins Letter, \u00b6 4.\n\n*Parkerings-Compagniet AS v.

Passive recreational activity is envisaged so as not to harm the existing flora and fauna.\n\n201.\n\nThe 1995 Cummins Letter was itself merely a reply by the Chief Town Planner to a proposed plan for the Sanctuary project, in which Mr. Allard requested Barbados' assurance that it would grant him certain permits, tax breaks, land leases and the lease of the Sluice Gate, allowing him to open it \"twice daily.\"339 Mr. Allard asked Barbados to give its \"general agreement to cooperate with correct ecological management of interconnecting waterways and lands between Graeme Hall and Government lands.\"340 In response, Mr. Cummins made it clear that he could not address at that stage the Claimant's specific investment plan, as it was \"difficult to comment on the proposal as submitted.\"341 Most certainly, he did not give any of the assurances requested by the Claimant. Rather, he clearly stated that his purpose was \"to highlight the environmental importance of the Graeme Hall Swamp.\"342\n\n*See* Exhibit C-26, Letter from Philip W. Moseley to the Chief Town Planner, 6 March 1995, attaching Exhibit C-21, Graeme Hall Lake - An Eco-Tourist Development Proposal by Ruby Sea Investments Ltd., 18 February 1995.\n\nExhibit C-21, Graeme Hall Lake - An Eco-Tourist Development Proposal by Ruby Sea Investments Ltd., 18 February 1995, p. 4.\n\nExhibit C-27, 1995 Cummins Letter, \u00b6 3.\n\nExhibit C-27, 1995 Cummins Letter, \u00b6 3.\n\n202.\n\nAdditionally, the 1995 Cummins Letter informed the Claimant that \"the proposed development require[d] formal planning permission\"343 and that \"a formal application to the Planning Office [was] required along with a comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment highlighting the assets of the development, areas of concern, the issues to be addressed and an environmental management plan for the wetland.\"344\n\nExhibit C-27, 1995 Cummins Letter, \u00b6 2.\n\nExhibit C-27, 1995 Cummins Letter, \u00b6 7.\n\n203.\n\nA similar statement was made in the letter dated 8 August 1996 from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs replying to the same proposal. The Ministry stated that \"the Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs has deferred making a decision in respect of the proposed Graeme Hall Bird Sanctuary until a now imminent Environmental Impact Assessment has been completed.\"345 Thus, the 1995 Cummins Letter and the 1996 letter from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs both served to highlight Mr. Allard's, as opposed to Barbados', obligations regarding the environmental aspects of the planned investment.\n\nExhibit C-34, Letter from the Permanent Secretary (Economic Affairs) in the Ministry of Financial and Economic Affairs to Joseph Ward, 8 August 1996.\n\n204.\n\nWith regard to the \"emphatic assurance\" by the former Deputy Prime Minister of Foreign Affairs and Tourism during a meeting in November 1996, even if it is accepted as having been given based solely on a letter written by the Claimant himself, it is insufficiently specific to give rise to legitimate expectations with regard to environmental protection of the Sanctuary.346\n\nExhibit C-36, Letter from Peter A. Allard to Hon. Billie Miller, 28 November 1996:  \n I am comforted by your emphatic assurance that yourself personally and the government of Barbados wish the project to continue under the auspices of private enterprise [...]. We are both agreed that once successfully completed, the project will create a major addition to Barbados already established list of attractions [...]. I appreciate your or Mr. Weeks comments that we will be allowed to carry this out without unreasonable restrictions imposed on us other than in the general context of our main themes of preservation, rehabilitation and sustainability.\n\n205.\n\nFurther, neither the First nor Second ARA Reports could be reasonably understood by the Claimant as giving rise to obligations on the part of Barbados. They were produced by \"a firm of consultants\" hired by Barbados to prepare a \"[s]tudy includ[ing] an examination of the feasibility of, and recommendations for, appropriate arrangement for operating a proposed Reserve at Graeme Hall as a tourism attraction.\"347 The study's only relevance to the Claimant's project was that the \"Government w[ould] be better able to make informed decisions regarding requested concessions for developments at Graeme Hall.\"348\n\nExhibit C-34, Letter from the Permanent Secretary (Economic Affairs) in the Ministry of Financial and Economic Affairs to Joseph Ward, 8 August 1996. *See also* Exhibit C-35, Letter from the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tourism and International Transport, 27 September 1996.\n\nExhibit C-34, Letter from the Permanent Secretary (Economic Affairs) in the Ministry of Financial and Economic Affairs to Joseph Ward, 8 August 1996.\n\n206.\n\nExternal consultants charged with producing a recommendation for the State are not an organ of the State as an entity exercising elements of governmental authority. Accordingly, any representations made in the First and Second ARA Reports cannot be attributed to Barbados. Nor did Barbados represent to Mr. Allard that it would follow the recommendations set out in these reports: it simply informed to \"whom it may concern\" that \"the Ministry of Tourism [contracted] the services of [ARA] to carry out a feasibility study.\"349\n\nExhibit C-35, Letter from the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tourism and International Transport, 27 September 1996.\n\n207.\n\nLikewise, any statement made by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Physical Development and Environment in his letter dated 22 March 2003, cannot be perceived as a specific representation attributable to the Government of Barbados. The Permanent Secretary unequivocally stated that the letter's subject fell \"outside [his] immediate remit,\" and that, therefore, \"any remarks [he] offer[ed] must simply be construed as general observations.\" He never induced the Claimant to believe that he was acting on behalf of Barbados, and clarified that all statements were based on \"[his] own view.\"350\n\nExhibit C-63, Letter from the Permanent Secretary (Environment) in the Ministry of Physical Development and Environment to Roger Sweeney, 22 March 2002, p. 1.\n\n208.\n\nHaving found no direct and specific representation capable of giving rise to legitimate expectations on the part of Mr. Allard regarding the environmental protection of the Sanctuary generally, the Tribunal need not address the question of whether Barbados' international obligations arising from its environmental treaties confirmed or reinforced the legitimacy of the Claimant's expectations.\n\n209.\n\n*Representations regarding the Sluice Gate* : Without regard to whether the Sluice Gate was the *causa causans* of the salinity problem (if there was one), the claim is that Barbados made specific and direct representations that it undertook to manage the Sluice Gate. As discussed above, the Claimant's complaint is that Barbados then failed to adequately maintain and operate the Sluice Gate to allow ingress and egress of water from and to the sea, failing in particular to operate the Sluice Gate in a way that would allow contaminants to be flushed from and seawater to enter the Sanctuary.\n\n210.\n\nThe fact that the Sluice Gate is located on land that is the property of the State at the end of a canal leading from the Sanctuary,351 suffices for the Tribunal to infer that maintenance and operation is the responsibility of the State. The question with respect to the application of the FET standard, however, is whether Mr. Allard had a legitimate expectation that Barbados would operate the Sluice Gate in any particular way, for example to facilitate the flushing of fresh water or the ingress of seawater.\n\nExhibit C-56, First ARA Report, pp. 3-1, 3-2.4-2.4-3; Exhibit C-57, Second ARA Report, pp. 2-22; 2-25; Exhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study, pp. 2-25, 2-26; Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 467:12-18 (examination of Mr. Ryan Chenery); Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 565:23-566:15 (examination of Mr. Mark Cummins).\n\n211.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Barbados committed to manage the Sluice Gate by its approval of the Amended EMP, which stated that:\n\n(i) \"the Government of Barbados would retain ultimate responsibility for sluice gate management\";\n\n(ii) \"[t]he need for a comprehensive drainage plan\" was \"in most respects,... fulfilled by [the 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study];\" and that\n\n(iii) \"it is clearly governments [sic] responsibility to undertake the work outlined in the drainage report.\"352\n\nReply, \u00b6 25, referring to Exhibit C-44, Amended EMP. *See also* Exhibit C-44, Amended EMP, Appendix A in particular, where the Claimant analysed in detail the 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study (Exhibit C-97).\n\n212.\n\nBarbados appears to have approved the Amended EMP in its entirety, including in its part concerning the drainage plan. By letter of 12 September 2000, the Chief Town Planner granted a conditional approval of the Amended EMP, subject to \"the approval of the drainage and storm water management plan\" by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport.353 At that time, the Claimant was fully aware that the \"matters relating to drainage and engineering works [were] the only outstanding issue\"354 and that he needed to undertake a series of further steps pursuant to comments made by the Ministry of Public Works and Transport on 27 November 2000.355 By letter dated 19 March 2001, the Claimant reported to the Chief Town Planner that he had \"adequately fulfilled the obligations for planning permission that related to drainage and storm water management.\"356 The Chief Town Planner did not reply to this letter or in any other way inform the Claimant that permission to his project was not granted. Nor did the Town & Country Development Planning Office send Mr. Allard a warning notice once he started building on the Sanctuary grounds as it had previously done when Mr. Allard had started construction works without prior approval.357 Not having objected at any time since, the Respondent cannot now contend that the planning permission was not granted to the Claimant's project.\n\nExhibit C-39, Letter from the Town & Country Development Planning Office to Roger Sweeney, 12 September 2000.\n\nExhibit C-39, Letter from the Town & Country Development Planning Office to Roger Sweeney, 12 September 2000.\n\nExhibit C-40, Letter from the Town & Country Development Planning Office to Roger Sweeney, 27 November 2000.\n\nExhibit C-172, Letter from GHNSI to the Chief Town Planner, 19 March 2001.\n\nExhibit R-36, Letter from the Town and Country Development Planning Office to Luther A. Bourne, 12 April 1999. *See also* Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 555:9-556: 1 4 (examination of Mr. Mark Cummins).\n\n213.\n\nHowever, in the Tribunal's view, the approval of the Amended EMP cannot be assimilated to an affirmative representation by Barbados that it would operate the Sluice Gate in accordance with the Amended EMP's proposals or in a way to protect the interests of Mr. Allard in the management of the Sanctuary.\n\n214.\n\nThe submission of an environmental management plan for the Sanctuary was a condition imposed on the Claimant by Barbados for receiving a planning and development permit. It was part of the Barbadian environmental assessment process. The Claimant admits that drainage-related issues \"came up during the environmental assessment process,\"358 after Barbados requested the Claimant to submit a \"comprehensive drainage plan of the swamp including the sluice gate,\"359 as a requirement for the approval of the EMP.\n\nHearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 54:23-25 (Claimant's opening statement)\n\nExhibit C-37, Letter from the Town & Country Development Planning Office, 27 March 1998.\n\n215.\n\nIt follows that the approval of the Amended EMP did not amount to an implicit undertaking of the State to adopt a course of conduct consistent with the terms of the EMP. The approval merely meant that Barbados deemed the EMP as sufficing for the purposes of the environmental impact assessment requirement. Barbados' approval of the Amended EMP, including in its part concerning the drainage plan, merely entitled the Claimant to expect that he could proceed with his project without objection from the State on environmental grounds, but did not constitute a representation that the State would manage the Sluice Gate as proposed in the EMP.\n\n216.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that Barbados did not make specific and direct representations giving rise to any legitimate expectations on the part of Mr. Allard regarding the maintenance and operation of the Sluice Gate.\n\n*(ii) Whether Mr. Allard relied on any representations of Barbados*\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n217.\n\nReliance by the investor on the host State's representations is an essential element of a claim of breach of the FET standard based on the notion of legitimate expectations.\n\n218.\n\nThe reliance criterion requires that the investor's decisions to invest be made in reliance on representations made to him by the State, including both his initial investment decision and also further investment decisions, such as a decision to inject additional capital into an ongoing project. In each case, a breach of the FET standard may arise if the State later acts in a manner contrary to its representations. However, the investor will be able to claim for damage in respect only of the part of its investment that was made after and in reliance on the State's representations.\n\n219.\n\nAccordingly, the Respondent's argument that its alleged representations to Mr. Allard were made, for the most part, after Mr. Allard's initial decision to invest in the Sanctuary and can therefore not have been relied upon by him, is not in itself dispositive.\n\n220.\n\nNevertheless, the Tribunal here finds that Mr. Allard did not make either his initial or later investment decisions in reliance on any representations made by Barbados. He presents as a person of philanthropic intentions and of enthusiasms. It appears that he took the decision to invest in 1994, before any of the alleged representations were made, with the exception of the 1986 Plan. In 1994, he made what may, without criticisms, be described as an impulsive commitment, followed by an offer to buy the first part of the Sanctuary grounds in February 1995.360 He ultimately bought it in 1996.361 Thereafter, the second and third parcels were purchased in 1998 and 1999.362 From 2000 to 2004, he funded construction at the site in preparation for the Sanctuary's opening to visitors in 2004.\n\nExhibit C-16, Letter from Peter A. Allard to Property Consultants Ltd., 3 February 1995.\n\nExhibit C-17, Property conveyance between Property Consultants Ltd. and GHNSI, 20 December 1996.\n\nExhibit C-19, Property conveyance between the estate of William Norman Alleyne and GHNSI, 7 October 1998; Exhibit C-18, Property conveyance between Southdown Enterprises Inc and GHNSI, 31 August 1999.\n\n221.\n\nIt is during this period from 1995 to 2004 that all of the alleged representations of Barbados on which the Claimant now seeks to rely were made. However, in the entirety of the evidence there is no confirmation that the taking of any of the investment decisions during this period was predicated upon the receipt by Mr. Allard of any relevant assurances from Barbados.\n\n222.\n\nIn summary, Mr. Allard appears to have taken the decision to create a bird and nature reserve on the Sanctuary grounds as early as his first visit to the Sanctuary in the company of Mr. Watson in 1994, and he moved in the following ten years toward the realization of his project irrespective, and not in reliance upon, any relevant representations made by Barbados.363 As words more of praise than of criticism, Mr. Allard appears to have been of visionary disposition in respect of this project. Unfortunately, when things go wrong, good intentions do not directly translate to establishing a backstop to shift responsibility under the terms of the BIT to the State.\n\nWatson Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 19-21; Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 182:19-183:15 (examination of Peter A. Allard); Hearing Tr., 14 December 2015, 820:13-821:10 (examination of Dr. Karl Watson).\n\n223.\n\nWhat is determinative here is that Mr. Allard's investment was conditional neither on any general expressions of positive environmental policy, such as those found in the 1986 Plan, the 1995 Cummins Letter, and the First and Second ARA Reports, nor on any representations concerning the management and operation of the Sluice Gate.\n\n224.\n\nAs to general environmental policy, although Mr. Allard realized that he would only receive Barbados' support once his EMP was approved,364 he nonetheless purchased the first and second parcels of the Sanctuary, and commenced its development, before even submitting an environmental management plan for approval, and did so against the advice and warnings of Barbados officials.365 The third parcel was acquired after the First EMP had been rejected, but before the submission of the Amended EMP.\n\n*See* Exhibit C-27, 1995 Cummins Letter; Exhibit C-34, Letter from the Permanent Secretary (Economic Affairs) in the Ministry of Financial and Economic Affairs to Joseph Ward, 8 August 1996.\n\nExhibit R-36, Letter from the Town and Country Development Planning Office to Luther A. Bourne, 12 April 1999.\n\n225.\n\nAs to the management and operation of the Sluice Gate, the main representation on which the Claimant seeks to rely is Barbados' overall approval of the Amended EMP in 2001.366 Yet, the Claimant bought all of the Sanctuary land and began the development of the project367 before the Amended EMP was approved, despite having been of the view that \"[c]orrect ecological operation of [the] sluice gate is a necessity to maintain the right saline content of Graeme Hall,\"368 as stated in his initial proposal of 1995.\n\nExhibit C-172, Letter from GHNSI to Chief Town Planner, 19 March 2001.\n\nExhibit R-36, Letter from the Town and Country Development Planning Office to Luther A. Bourne, 12 April 1999.\n\nExhibit C-21, Graeme Hall Lake - An Eco-Tourist Development Proposal by Ruby Sea Investments Ltd., 18 February 1995.\n\n*(iii) Conclusion*\n------------------\n\n226.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has failed to establish that:\n\n(1) Barbados made any specific representations to the Claimant; and that\n\n(2) the Claimant relied on any such representations in acquiring and developing the Sanctuary.\n\n227.\n\nAs the Claimant did not rely, the question of whether reliance was reasonable is moot.\n\n228.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal cannot find a violation of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.\n\n**2. FPS**\n----------\n\n229.\n\nArticle II(2) of the BIT relevantly provides:\n\n2. Each Contracting Party shall accord investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party: [...]\n\n(b) full protection and security [...]\n\n**(a) The Claimant's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the FPS standard obligates the host State to act with due diligence to \"protect investments against injury by private parties,\"369 requiring \"nothing more nor less than the reasonable measures of prevention which a well-administered government could be expected to exercise,\" without \"any need to establish malice or negligence,\"370 and that here, Barbados' obligations under the *Convention on Biological Diversity* and the *Ramsar Convention* heighten the level of diligence required.371 Further, the Claimant argues that in determining whether a State has exercised due diligence, it is relevant to consider whether:\n\n(i) the facts at issue were known to the host State;\n\n(ii) the host State conducted investigations in response to complaints by the investor; and\n\n(iii) the host State took adequate steps to apprehend a wrongdoer or otherwise enforce a penalty.372\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 115.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 116, *quoting Agricultural Products v.

Specifically, Barbados failed to adequately manage the Sluice Gate and enforce its environmental laws, such as the *Marine Pollution Control Act*.379\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 137-139, referring to Exhibit C-107, *Marine Pollution Act Control Act*, L.R.O. 1998, CAP 392A; Claimant's Skeleton Argument, \u00b6 55.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that his letters to Barbados380 and Barbados' own internal documents381 establish that Barbados was aware both of the risks arising from mismanagement of the Sluice Gate and the environmental degradation of the Sanctuary. The Claimant highlights his repeated offers to assist Barbados with the prevention and remediation of environmental damage to the Sanctuary and particularly with the repair of the Sluice Gate, including that he sponsored a three-day trip for Government officials to meet with specialists in Florida and provided $5,000 to the CZMU for hydrology testing and monitoring equipment.382\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 70-71, 137, referring to Exhibits C-68 to C-70, Letters from Roger Sweeney to the Chief Town Planner, the CZMU and the Chief Environmental Engineer dated 24 and 25 October 2000; Exhibit C-50, Letter from Stuart Heaslet to the Chief Environmental Engineer, 14 April 2004; Exhibit C-71, Letter from Peter A.

Allard to the Minister of Health and the Director of the CZMU dated 13 October 2009), and water levels (Exhibits C-49 to C-50, Letters from Stuart Heaslet to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Publics Works dated 12 January and 25 March 2004, and to the Chief Environmental Health Officer in the Ministry of Health, 14 April 2004; Exhibit C-51, Fax from Harry Roberts to the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Public Works, 17 November 2004; Exhibits R-88 to R-89, Letters from Harry Roberts to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Public Works dated 5 October 2005 and 24 May 2006). In addition, drainage and sewage discharge issues were recurrent subjects of discussion during the Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee's meetings, at which the Claimant complained directly to Barbados' officials. Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1493:9-17 (Claimant's closing statement); Exhibit C-174, Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee Meeting: List of Attendees and Minutes of Meeting, 11 February 2005; Exhibit R-71, Minutes of the Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee meeting of 17 October 2005, 4 November 2005; Exhibit C-175, Report of the Graeme Hall Science Committee Meeting, 9 June 2006.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal further finds, however, that, being aware of the environmental sensitivities of the Sanctuary, Barbados took reasonable steps to protect it.\n\n243.\n\nIt is accepted by the Claimant that the obligation of the State to provide the investment with FPS is not one of strict liability, but of \"due diligence\" or \"reasonable care.\"407 Relevantly, and as noted in *El Paso v. Argentina* :\n\n[...] the obligation to show \"due diligence\" does not mean that the State has to prevent each and every injury. Rather, the obligation is generally understood as requiring that the State take reasonable actions within its power to avoid injury when it is, or should be, aware that there is a risk of injury. The precise degree of care, of what is \"reasonable or \"due\", depends in part on the circumstances.408\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 115; Hearing Tr., 8 December 2015, 80:19-22 (Claimant's opening statement).\n\n*El Paso Energy International Company v. Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, \u00b6 523.\n\n244.\n\nThe obligation is limited to reasonable action, and a host State is not required to take any specific steps that an investor asks of it. The fact that Barbados is a party to the *Convention on Biological Diversity* and the *Ramsar Convention* does not change the standard under the BIT, although consideration of a host State's international obligations may well be relevant in the application of the standard to particular circumstances.\n\n245.\n\nHere, it is established that Barbadian officials implemented procedures to prevent environmental damage to the Sanctuary both on their own initiative and in response to the Claimant's complaints.409 In particular, Barbados established the Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee (\"**Committee**\") in 2003, in order \"to investigate and coordinate government action at Graeme Hall [Swamp] in an integrated manner.\"410 The Committee was comprised of representatives of all the ministries responsible for managing the Graeme Hall Swamp ecosystem,411 as well as representatives of private stakeholders, including GHNSI.412 The Committee \"was tasked by Cabinet to meet as often as necessary and to report back to government\" in order to \"address the issues related to effective management of the Graeme Hall ecosystem,\"413 and undertook to develop a Master Plan for the longterm preservation of the Graeme Hall Swamp,414 which, in its draft form of 2007, identified \"the significant issues of concern affecting the environmental [conditions of the swamp's ecosystem]\" and set forth the \"immediate actions required to ameliorate [these] environmental problems,\"415 including, *inter alia*, sewage management, use of adjacent lands, drainage and the Sluice Gate.416\n\nBarbados usually took into account the Claimant's position. *See* Inniss Statement, \u00b6 10; Exhibit C-174, Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee Meeting: List of Attendees and Minutes of Meeting, 11 February 2005, p. 4; Exhibit R-71, Minutes of the Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee meeting of 17 October 2005, 4 November 2005, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 14; Exhibit C-175, Report of the Graeme Hall Science Committee Meeting, 9 June 2006; Exhibit R-39, Letter from the Minister of Energy and the Environment to Stuart Heaslet, 29 June 2007; Exhibit R-44, Worthing Sluice Gate Study, Final Report, Baird & Associates, 31 May 2011, p. 4.\n\nInniss Statement, \u00b6 9. *See also* Witness Statement by Mr. Steve Devonish dated 27 August 2015 (\"Devonish Statement\"), \u00b6 8.\n\nInniss Statement, \u00b6 9; Devonish Statement, \u00b6 9.\n\nInniss Statement, \u00b6 10; Exhibit C-174, Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee Meeting: List of Attendees and Minutes of Meeting, 11 February 2005, p. 4; Exhibit R-71, Minutes of the Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee meeting of 17 October 2005, 4 November 2005, p. 1; Exhibit C-175, Report of the Graeme Hall Science Committee Meeting, 9 June 2006, p. 1.\n\nDevonish Statement, \u00b6 9.\n\n*See* Exhibit C-72, Draft Master Plan for the Graeme Hall Ecosystem, September 2007.\n\nExhibit C-72, Draft Master Plan for the Graeme Hall Ecosystem, September 2007, p. 9. *See also* Inniss Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 45-47.\n\nExhibit C-72, Draft Master Plan for the Graeme Hall Ecosystem, September 2007, pp. 26-31.\n\n246.\n\nThe Committee addressed the interaction between the Sanctuary and the South Coast Sewage Plant,417 as evidenced by the Government's prompt reaction to the 2005 spill.418 It also ensured that any land development applications submitted to the Chief Town Planner were consistent with the objective of environmental protection of the Sanctuary and prevented the establishment of potential polluters in the vicinity of the Sanctuary.419 When the Sluice Gate became inoperable, the Committee coordinated the action of the responsible ministries to ensure drainage of the Graeme Hall Swamp by other means,420 while the Government collected data in terms of water levels and water quality421 and carried out relevant studies422 to ascertain the hydrology of the site and the interaction between the swamp and the sea.423\n\nInniss Statement, \u00b6\u00b6 30, 33.\n\nThe Government commissioned a water quality study to investigate the effects of the sewage spill on the Sanctuary's waters days after the spill occurred.

For instance, in the context of the review of an application for the construction of a water amusement park near the Sanctuary, the Claimant \"raised a number of concerns with respect to the [Environmental Impact Assessment of the development] specifically related to water usage and discharge.\" Exhibit C-175, Report of the Graeme Hall Science Committee Meeting, 9 June 2006. The application was then rejected by the Minister responsible for town planning matters on the grounds that \"[t]he Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) submitted in support of the project did not systematically identify possible measures to avoid reducing potentially adverse impacts.\" Exhibit R-33, Decision on Application for Proposed Waterpark, 3 January 2008. *See also* Second Cummins Statement, \u00b6 12.\n\nThese measures included the placement of an artificial sandbar in front of the Sluice Gate by the Ministry of Public Works of Barbados (Hearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 770:12-772:2 (examination of Dr. Lorna Inniss)); the removal of the sand piled in the canal by the Drainage Division as required to control water levels and flooding (Hearing Tr., December 10, 2015, 663:1-15 (examination of Mr. Steve Devonish); channel-clearing conducted by the CZMU; and sedges-clearing by the Ministry of Health (Exhibit C-175, Report of the Graeme Hall Science Committee Meeting, 9 June 2006).\n\nHearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 721:10-22; 726:18-727:9; 733:10-735:7 (examination of Dr. Lorna Inniss). *See also* Exhibit C-84, Letter from Stuart Heaslet to Dr. Lorna Inniss, 17 November 2003.\n\nThese studies included: a review of all the research ever done on the Graeme Hall Swamp carried out by a master's student at the University of West Indies; a review of the hydrology of the swamp and the sea by the CZMU (*see* Exhibit C-174, Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee Meeting: List of Attendees and Minutes of Meeting, 11 February 2005); the Graeme Hall project regarding the assessment of surface water balance and the design of a new sluice gate, conducted by the CZMU together with McGill University (*see* Exhibit R-71, Minutes of the Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee meeting of 17 October 2005, 4 November 2005); the review of the operation of the Sluice Gate and the study of the Worthing Lagoon area conducted by Baird & Associates in 2004 and 2006 (*see* Exhibit R-41, Letter from Derek Williamson (Baird & Associates) to the CZMU, 5 May 2010; Exhibit R-44, Worthing Sluice Gate Study, Final Report, Baird & Associates, 31 May 2011, p. 4). *See also* Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 663:6-664:7 (examination of Mr. Steve Devonish).\n\nIt appears that Barbados has recently decided to go forward with the sluice gate proposal prepared by Baird & Associates, which is currently undergoing an environmental impact assessment. *See* Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 645:23-646:7 (examination of Mr. Steve Devonish). *See also* Exhibit R-44, Worthing Sluice Gate Study, Final Report, Baird & Associates, 31 May 2011, p. 4; Exhibit R-46, Graeme Hall Swamp Outlet Outfall and Outfall Intake Structure, Project No. 11334 prepared by Baird & Associates for the Government of Barbados (Ministry of Environment and Drainage), 5 June 2013; Exhibit R-47, Planning Application submitted by Director, Natural Heritage Department to Town and Country Planning, 26 May 2014; Exhibit R-48, Letter from the Town and Country Development Planning Office to the Natural Heritage Department, 28 July 2014.\n\n247.\n\nAs noted in paragraph 153 above, the Sluice Gate was close to inoperable during the entire Relevant Period. However, the issues concerning repair and operation of the Sluice Gate and the passing of water between the Sanctuary and the sea are not the simple matters the Claimant suggests they are. There is a wider group of stakeholders, and the Tribunal accepts the explanations made by Dr. Inniss that \"there needed to be a wider solution besides just the gate, [that a] major hydrogeological study... was needed to understand how the hydrology in the swamp should be optimized and the structures that should be put in place in order to give effect to that optimization.\"424 Thus, the coastal geomorphology of the beach needed to be assessed to understand what type of repair was required.425 The only known options for upgrading the Sluice Gate during the Relevant Period were those proposed in the 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study.426 However, by 2006, the situation on the ground had changed, the width of the beach having increased significantly,427 which limited both tidal and groundwater exchange.428 As explained by Dr. Inniss:\n\n[...] what was urgently needed before [the] Government invested in a new gate was that hydrogeological study that would then tell us whether we needed a series of gates or a series of weirs or whether we needed to change the elevation of certain sections of the swamp so that hydrology within the wetland would be optimized. We felt that that was much more urgent than a new sluice gate.429\n\nHearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 776:11-17 (examination of Dr. Lorna Inniss). *See also* Hearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 794:12-795:2 (examination of Dr. Lorna Inniss).\n\nHearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 781:5-22 (examination of Dr. Lorna Inniss). *See also* Hearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 777:21-778:12 (examination of Dr. Lorna Inniss).\n\nExhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study, pp. 3-21 to 3-26.\n\nHearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 781:8-11 (examination of Dr. Lorna Inniss).\n\nExhibit C-72, Draft Master Plan for the Graeme Hall Ecosystem, September 2007, pp. 2-3, 5; Exhibit R-71, Minutes of the Graeme Hall Stewardship Committee meeting of 17 October 2005, 4 November 2005.\n\nHearing Tr., 11 December 2015, 794:21-795:2 (examination of Dr. Lorna Inniss).\n\n248.\n\nThe Sluice Gate's operation would affect the Sanctuary, the surrounding lands, including government lands, as well as the public beach. The interaction between the Sanctuary and the sea through the Sluice Gate raised two major concerns. First, the wastewater discharged from the Sluice Gate onto the beach necessarily would have a negative impact on the near-shore sea grass, coral reefs and water quality,430 and affect the availability of adjacent tourist and public uses of the sea and its beaches. Second, operation of the Sluice Gate in a way that would allow seawater to enter the Sanctuary (assuming this is possible) may entail the risk of flooding of the adjacent properties.431 It was therefore no easy issue to establish the hydrology of the whole area and to administer it in the interests of all the stakeholders.\n\nExhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study, pp *.* 2-22, 2-23, 2-25, 3-24; Exhibit C-56, First ARA Report, p. 5-5; Exhibit C-72, Draft Master Plan for the Graeme Hall Ecosystem, September 2007, p. 8; Exhibit R-41, Letter from Derek Williamson (Baird & Associates) to the CZMU, 5 May 2010. *See also* Hearing Tr., 10 December 2015, 647:5-17 (examination of Mr. Steve Devonish).\n\nExhibit C-97, 1996 Barbados Stormwater Drainage Study, p. 2-23; Exhibit R-44, Worthing Sluice Gate Study, Final Report, Baird & Associates, 31 May 2011, p. 4.\n\n249.\n\nUnder these circumstances, Barbados' approach in addressing the Sluice Gate and general pollution issues at the Sanctuary as part of its governance of the entire area does not fall short of what was appropriate and sufficient for purposes of the duty of due diligence required by Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.\n\n250.\n\nStanding back from the detail of the Claimant's retrospective analysis of the situation of the Sluice Gate during the Relevant Period, it is quite implausible for the Claimant to attribute responsibility for the egress or ingress of Sanctuary waters to the actions or inactions with respect to the operation of the Sluice Gate.\n\n251.\n\nThe Tribunal is also not satisfied that Barbados breached the FPS standard in any respect by failing to enforce the *Marine Pollution Control Act.* On no view is the claim sufficiently particularized. The Claimant's claim is that Section 3 \"creates the criminal offence of releasing any pollutant into the environment in excess of applicable standards\" and that Barbados failed to enforce the *Act* against \"any of the sources of contamination of the Sanctuary's waters.\"432 Yet the Claimant has not even attempted to identify which sources of pollution that allegedly contaminated the Sanctuary's waters were also prosecutable offences under the *Act*. Additionally, the Claimant appears not to have informed Barbados of the need for the enforcement of the *Act* at any time before this arbitration.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6\u00b6 122, 139.\n\n252.\n\nIn summary, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent's submission that the Claimant has failed to establish that Barbados violated its obligations of the FPS standard. Even accepting the Claimant's articulation of the FPS standard as including an obligation of the host State to protect foreign investments against environmental damage, and assuming (*quod non*) that environmental damage was proven in the present case, the Tribunal finds that no violation of the FPS standard arising under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT is established.\n\n**3. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n253.\n\nArticle VIII of the BIT relevantly provides:\n\nInvestments or returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalized, expropriated or subjected to measures having an effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\") in the territory of the other Contracting Party, except for a public purpose, under due process of law, in a non-discriminatory manner and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. [...]\n\n**(a) The Claimant's position**\n-------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe claim is that the Respondent has applied \"measures having an effect equivalent to... expropriation.\"433 Such indirect expropriation occurs where a \"measure substantially deprives the owner of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of the property.\"434\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 105.\n\nStatement of Claim, \u00b6 107, referring to *Metalclad Corporation v.

Further, the Sanctuary has not suffered environmental damage, whether occasioned by the Respondent or otherwise.443 It attracted substantial numbers of visitors until it closed in 2009444 and, since then, the Claimant has elected to continue such commercial operations on the site as a caf\u00e9 and also renting it for wedding celebrations and other social activities.445\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 233. *See also* Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 117-118; Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1637:1-5 (Respondent's closing statement).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 233, referring to Second Hunte Report, pp. 24-25; Exhibit R-9, Evanson \"Nature lovers' haven\", *Weekend Nation*, 14 November 2008. *See also* Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1637:12-19 (Respondent's closing statement).\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 233, referring to Statement of Claim, \u00b6 18(c); Exhibits C-146 and C-147, Event Booking Sheets for 2008 and 2009.\n\n260.\n\nMoreover, the environmental conditions of which the Claimant complains were in place when he acquired the site and \"loss\" cannot be of something never possessed.446 In summary, the Respondent submits that:\n\nEverything in the record of this matter points to the conclusion that the Claimant closed the [Sanctuary], not because the Respondent had forced its closure through any alleged action or inaction, but because the Claimant realised that his operation was uneconomic; and also because the Claimant finally realised that he would have to be responsible for the operation costs.447\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 234.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 235.\n\n261.\n\nAn investor's reasonable expectations as to the potential use of his property are relevant to determining whether there has been an indirect expropriation.448 Here, the Claimant intended to run the Sanctuary as an eco-tourism attraction.449 His acquisition of parts of the Sanctuary was subject to specific covenants to the effect that the Sanctuary would not be available for development.450 In this context, he has no reasonable complaint that the Sanctuary \"cannot be put to any use other than as a conservation project.\"451\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 238-239.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 240, referring to Statement of Claim, \u00b6 59; First Allard Statement, \u00b6 7.\n\nRejoinder, \u00b6 240, referring to Exhibit C-18, Property conveyance between Property Consultants Ltd. and GHNSI, 31 August 1999, p. 3; Exhibit C-19, Property conveyance between Property Consultants Ltd. and GHNSI, 7 October 1998, p. 3. *See also* Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1637:6-11 (Respondent's closing statement).\n\nRespondent's Skeleton Argument, p. 7, *quoting* Reply, \u00b6 111.\n\n262.\n\nIt has consistently been held by tribunals that protections against unlawful expropriation do not restrict the State's freedom to enact general legislation and take non-discriminatory measures within the police power of the State.452 The designation of the Sanctuary under the *Ramsar Convention* and the 2003 Plan was \"fully consistent with sound public policy and was wholly within the police powers of the Respondent.\" Consequently, such designation does not amount to an indirect expropriation.453\n\nRespondent's Skeleton Argument, p. 7; Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 244-247, referring to *S.D. Myers, Inc v. Canada*, UNCITRAL, Partial Award, 13 November 2000, \u00b6 28; *Too v. Greater Modesto Insurance Associates and the United States of America*, Iran-US Claims Tribunal, Award No. 460-880-2, 1989 WL 663898, 29 December 10989, \u00b6 59; *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award, 16 December 2002, \u00b6 105.\n\nRespondent's Skeleton Argument, p. 7; Rejoinder, \u00b6 248; Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1637:20-1638:1 (Respondent's closing statement).\n\n**(c) The Tribunal's analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n263.\n\nAs acknowledged by both Parties, and as is accepted by the Tribunal, the first requirement for a successful claim of indirect expropriation is that, as a result of measures taken by the host State, the investor have suffered a substantial deprivation of the use or expected economic benefit of the investment, such that the investor must establish that the effect of the measures taken by the host State resembles the effect of a direct expropriation.\n\n264.\n\nOn any view, here it is not established that there has been any such deprivation. Mr. Allard remains the owner of the Sanctuary grounds, on which he continues to operate a caf\u00e9, and acknowledged at the Hearing that \"there is some kind of business remaining there.\"454 It is therefore undisputed that the Claimant has not been deprived of his *entire* investment in Barbados.\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1516:22-24 (Claimant's closing statement). *See also* Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1516:16-17 (Claimant's closing statement); Exhibits C-146 and C-147, Event Booking Sheets for 2008 and 2009.\n\n265.\n\nThe argument here is that what has been expropriated is neither the land nor the caf\u00e9, but his ability to run an eco-tourism business. This appears to imply that it is the anticipated returns of an ecotourism business that constituted the expected economic benefit of the investment. However, even if the Tribunal were to accept that the destruction of the Claimant's ability to run an eco-tourism business on the Sanctuary grounds could constitute an indirect expropriation under Article VIII of the BIT, the Tribunal's conclusion on the facts that the Claimant has failed to establish that his decision to cease operating the Sanctuary was due to any degradation of the environment at the Sanctuary forecloses the expropriation claim.\n\n266.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant's claim under Article VIII of the BIT.\n\n**C. JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTIONS**\n--------------------------------\n\n267.\n\n*Deferred temporal objection*. As noted in paragraph 16 above, in its Award on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal deferred to the merits phase of this arbitration the Respondent's Jurisdictional Objection pertaining to the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the Claimant's claims arising from the alleged mismanagement of the Sluice Gate.455\n\nAward on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 112-113.\n\n268.\n\nArticle XIII(3) of the BIT provides for a three-year limitation period on arbitration claims:\n\nAn investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:\n\n[...] (d) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.\n\n269.\n\nAs the Claimant commenced these proceedings on 21 May 2010, pursuant to Article XIII(3) the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over claims arising from alleged breaches and consequent loss or damage of which the Claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge before 21 May 2007. On this basis, the Parties disagree as to whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimant's claims arising from the alleged mismanagement of the Sluice Gate. Their positions on this question were summarized in the Award on Jurisdiction.456\n\nAward on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 97-98, 100-107.\n\n270.\n\nAs noted, the Tribunal deferred consideration of this question to the present phase of the proceedings \"as impleading issues intertwined with those that will arise for determination under the merits phase,\"457 where the Tribunal's determination is that the Claimant has failed both to establish that Barbados breached the BIT by mismanaging the Sluice Gate and that Mr. Allard incurred any loss or damage as a result of mismanagement of the Sluice Gate. This renders moot the question of the Tribunal's jurisdiction *ratione temporis* over the Claimant's claims arising from such alleged mismanagement. Conceptually time, even on an imputed basis, cannot be said to be capable of running from a non-event.\n\nAward on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 112.\n\n271.\n\n*Further jurisdictional objections*. The Respondent argued in its closing statement on the last day of the Hearing that Mr. Allard's further answers under cross-examination had given rise to \"two new jurisdictional issues.\"458\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1587:2-6 (Respondent's closing statement).\n\n272.\n\nFirst, the Respondent invoked Mr. Allard's admissions under examination concerning his motivation to buy the Sanctuary to invite the Tribunal to revisit its decision at the Jurisdictional Objections phase as to whether Mr. Allard was an investor under the BIT.459 Specifically, Mr. Allard gave the following answers to questions from the Respondent's counsel:\n\nQ. If you had managed to sign those contracts with the cruise ships and tour operators, and because of that, if you made your Business Plan, you made your budget, you reached your goal, the site became self-sustaining, and made a modest profit, but the sluice gate wasn't operated the way you wanted, would you have closed the Sanctuary?\n\nMr. Allard: I believe so, yes.\n\nQ. Is that what a businessman does?\n\nMr. Allard: When you have no control over your\u2014the environment that's polluting you, yes.\n\nQ. So, a businessman, who makes his Business Plan, achieves his objectives and makes a modest profit that was his entire Business Plan, would nonetheless close his operations?\n\nMr. Allard: Yeah, for sure.460\n\n*See* paragraph 16 above. Hearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1587:6:21 (Respondent's closing statement); PowerPoint of Respondent's closing statement at the Hearing, slide 74.\n\nPowerPoint of Respondent's closing statement at the Hearing, slides 75-76, referring to Hearing Tr., 9 December 2015, 319:14-320:3 (examination of Mr. Peter A. Allard).\n\n273.\n\nIn his rebuttal closing statement, the Claimant's counsel contended that Mr. Allard's answers only confirm that, as found by the Tribunal in the Award on Jurisdiction, he \"had a combination of motives that included environmental conservation,\" and hence to raise this issue as a new ground on closing arguments does not justify reopening the Award on Jurisdiction.461\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1661:13-25 (Claimant's closing statement).\n\n274.\n\nIn its Award on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that \"expectations of an eventual profit were honestly held by Mr. Allard when establishing the Sanctuary in 1996 and thereafter, notwithstanding that during the Sanctuary's establishment and operations factors of profit were considered secondary and in the background to his principal motivations of environmental and public purposes.\"462 Within their context, Mr. Allard's elaborations as to his motivations do not impugn the basis of the prior findings where the Claimant was successful, if only just, on this issue of characterisation of his expenditures as an investment.\n\nAward on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 51.\n\n275.\n\nIn any event, were the Tribunal of the contrary opinion, considerations of issue estoppel, or even *res judicata*, might have arisen. This possibility also falls into the \u2018unnecessary to decide' category.\n\n276.\n\nThe second additional jurisdictional issue raised by the Respondent is that Mr. Allard admitted that his claims are for future harm, while actual loss or damage are requirements for the Tribunal's jurisdiction under Article XIII(1) of the BIT.463\n\nHearing Tr., 17 December 2015, 1587:22-1588:12, 1590:2-22 (Respondent's closing statement); PowerPoint of Respondent's closing statement at the Hearing, slides 77-78, referring to Hearing Tr., 9 December 2015, 282:9-11 (examination of Mr. Peter A. Allard).\n\n277.\n\nThe Respondent's last submission raises the question of whether injury is a jurisdictional requirement of the BIT. It was not otherwise discussed in this arbitration, is not based on any new fact or circumstance and could, and therefore should, have been made during the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings. The fact that other findings made in this Award dispose of all the Claimant's claims suffices to make it otiose to admit this ground for consideration.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n**A. RELEVANT PROVISIONS**\n--------------------------\n\n278.\n\nArticle 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides that \"[t]he arbitral tribunal shall fix the costs of arbitration in its award\" and defines such costs as follows:\n\nThe term \"costs\" includes only:\n\n*(a)* The fees of the arbitral tribunal to be stated separately as to each arbitrator and to be fixed by the tribunal itself in accordance with article 39;\n\n*(b)* The travel and other expenses incurred by the arbitrators;\n\n*(c)* The costs of expert advice and of other assistance required by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n*(d)* The travel and other expenses of witnesses to the extent such expenses are approved by the arbitral tribunal;\n\n*(e)* The costs for legal representation and assistance of the successful party if such costs were claimed during the arbitral proceedings, and only to the extent that the arbitral tribunal determines that the amount of such costs is reasonable;\n\n*(f)* Any fees and expenses of the appointing authority as well as the expenses of the Secretary-General of the Permanent Court of Arbitration at The Hague.\n\n279.\n\nArticle 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides for the allocation of the costs of arbitration:\n\n1. Except as provided in paragraph 2, the costs of arbitration shall in principle be borne by the unsuccessful party. However, the arbitral tribunal may apportion each of such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case.\n\n2. With respect to the costs of legal representation and assistance referred to in article 38, paragraph (e), the arbitral tribunal, taking into account the circumstances of the case, shall be free to determine which party shall bear such costs or may apportion such costs between the parties if it determines that apportionment is reasonable.\n\n**B. COSTS OF ARBITRATION (OTHER THAN THE COSTS INCURRED BY THE PARTIES)**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n280.\n\nThe Parties deposited with the PCA a total of $1,200,000 ($600,000 each) to cover the costs of the arbitration set out in Article 38(a), (b) and (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules. The costs disbursed by the PCA from that deposit break down as follows:464\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **TRIBUNAL** | **$835,107** |\n| Dr. Gavan Griffith QC | $471,277 |\n| Expenses: | $18,297 |\n| Fees: | $452,980 |\n|  |  |\n| Professor Andrew Newcombe | $172,250 |\n| Expenses: | $17,593 |\n| Fees: | $154,657 |\n|  |  |\n| Professor W. Michael Reisman | $191,580 |\n| Expenses: | $2,355 |\n| Fees: | $189,225 |\n|  |  |\n| **PCA** | **$189,795** |\n| Expenses: | $8,995 |\n| Fees: | $180,800 |\n|  |  |\n| **OTHER EXPENSES** (including court reporters, hearing facilities, banking costs) | **$109,421** |\n|  |  |\n| **TOTAL** | **$1,134,323** |\n\nAll figures are rounded off to the nearest dollar.\n\n281.\n\nAccordingly, the costs of the arbitration set out in Article 38(a), (b) and (c) of the UNCITRAL Rules amount to $1,134,323. This leaves an unexpended balance of $65,677 to be returned to the Parties by the PCA in equal shares.\n\n282.\n\nNo costs were incurred under Article 38(f), as neither the services of an appointing authority nor the services of the Secretary-General of the PCA were required.\n\n**C. COSTS INCURRED BY THE PARTIES**\n------------------------------------\n\n283.\n\nIn summary, the costs stated as incurred by the Parties under Article 38(d) and (e) of the UNCITRAL Rules are:\n\n|  |  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  | **Claimant** | | **Respondent** | |\n| **Costs for legal representation and assistance** |  | **$936,883** |  | **$5,199,894** |\n| 2 lead counsel (at a time) | $614,897 $318,388 | 6 lead counsel | $1,386,546 $1,055,450  $952,211$429,555  $410,320  $300,456 |\n| 1 legal clerk | $3,598 | 10 other lawyers | $665,356 |\n| **Disbursements for witness and expert costs** |  | **$244,929** |  | **$330,416** |\n| forensic expert | $26,641 | forensic experts | $116,178 |\n| environmental experts | $67,972 | environmental expert | $43,839 |\n| damages experts | $95,085 | damages experts | $153,770 |\n| Chancery Chambers (Barbadian counsel) | $55,231 | Dr. Karl Watson | $16,629 |\n| **Other charges and disbursements** |  | **$59,321** |  | **$320,547** |\n| **TOTAL** |  | **$1,241,133** |  | **$5,850,857** |\n\n284.\n\nThe Parties' submissions as to costs were filed in advance of the outcome constituted by this Award, and the Tribunal has regard to these submissions as relevant to the outcome that the Claimant's claims stand dismissed.\n\n**D. FIXING AND ALLOCATION OF COSTS**\n-------------------------------------\n\n**1. The Claimant's position**\n------------------------------\n\n285.\n\nThe Claimant submits that, in the exercise of its discretionary power to award costs under Article 40,465 the Tribunal should examine the \"\u2018success' of a party on an issue by issue basis rather than by looking at only the final result.\"466 In particular, the Claimant's success with respect to the Jurisdictional Objections, fraud allegations and procedural issues raised by the Respondent \"should be weighed together with the final outcome on the merits in any final costs award.\"467\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, \u00b6\u00b6 5-6.\n\nClaimant's Costs Submission, \u00b6 13, referring to *Malicorp v.

The Respondent's position**\n--------------------------------\n\n290.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the \"\u2018loser pays' principle\" embraced by Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Rules requires the Tribunal to identify Barbados as the successful party \"of the case as a whole,\"486 and that the Claimant \"should be ordered to cover the entirety of the costs incurred by the Respondent,\"487 including its costs of legal representation and assistance.488\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 5. *See also* Respondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 7.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 3.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 8.\n\n291.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, there are no compelling circumstances in this case that would require the Tribunal to depart from the \"\u2018loser pays' principle.\"489 In particular, the Respondent argues that:\n\n(i) there was no \"victory\" for the Claimant on the Jurisdictional Objections phase, as \"the very essence of the Claimant's case\" was reserved for determination in the merits phase;490\n\n(ii) neither at the jurisdictional phase nor at the merits phase has the Claimant discharged his burden of proof in relation to the Tribunal's jurisdiction;491\n\n(iii) the Respondent's procedural conduct during the jurisdictional phase was \"perfectly legitimate, objectively justifiable and, in light of the fundamental shortcomings in the Claimant's evidence, necessary\";492\n\n(iv) the Claimant's intention to conduct a \"trial by press release\" forced the Respondent to expend significant resources493 and had the potential to \"threaten the procedural integrity of the proceedings,\"494 and therefore, the Claimant's reliance on the Tribunal's decision on confidentiality must be dismissed;495 and\n\n(v) the procedural issues relating to document production only serve to establish that the Claimant's case is \"frivolous and speculative.\"496\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 7.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 9.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 12-14, 18-20.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 22.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 26.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 27.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 25.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 36. *See also* Respondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32.\n\n292.\n\nOverall, the Respondent argues that it was its duty \"as sovereign State\"497 to challenge \"the Claimant's case as pleaded\"498 as well as \"to bring to the Tribunal's attention the manifest flaws in the Claimant's case.\"499 Thus, if the Claimant's case is dismissed, whether on jurisdiction or on the merits, the Claimant should bear all of Respondent's costs.500\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 12.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 15.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 12.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 23.\n\n293.\n\nIn addition, the Respondent identifies further grounds that justify an award of costs in its favour, including:\n\n(i) the Claimant's \"shifting argumentation\" throughout this arbitration;501\n\n(ii) the Claimant's \"out-of-turn surrejoinder\" submitted prior to the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits;502 and\n\n(iii) the excessive number of witness statements and expert reports submitted by the Claimant.503\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 3, 40.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 37-38.\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6\u00b6 41-42.\n\n294.\n\nFinally, it is the Respondent's position that its legal costs are reasonable and comparable to amounts spent by other respondents in investor-State arbitration proceedings.504\n\nRespondent's Reply on Costs, \u00b6 45, referring to \"How much Does an ICSID Arbitration Cost? A Snapshot of the Last Five Years\", *Kluwer Arbitration Blog,* 29 February 2016.\n\n**3. The Tribunal's analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n295.\n\nIn exercising the discretion accorded it by Articles 38 and 40 the UNCITRAL Rules to fix the costs of arbitration and apportion them between the Parties, the Tribunal is directed to apply the principle of reasonableness in light of all the circumstances of the case.\n\n296.\n\nUnder the \"costs follow the event\" principle, a costs order would be made in favour of the Respondent. The Respondent has, indeed, prevailed on all merits issues, including the many and diverse factual issues raised for determination, and also the allegations of breach of BIT obligations.\n\n297.\n\nHowever, different considerations may apply to the disposition of different categories of costs.\n\n298.\n\n*Costs of arbitration (other than the costs of the Parties)*. The Tribunal's view is that these costs should follow the ultimate event, and the Respondent's share of costs advanced be recouped from the Claimant. As the successful party, the Respondent has been \"forced to go through the process in order to achieve success, and should not be penalised by having to pay for the process itself.\"505\n\n*SD Myers, Inc. v. Government of Canada*, UNCITRAL, Final Award on Costs, 30 December 2002, \u00b6 15.\n\n299.\n\nAs noted in paragraphs 280-281 above, the costs of arbitration (other than the costs of the Parties) amount to $1,134,323, of which the Respondent contributed half ($567,162). Accordingly, the Claimant should reimburse this amount to the Respondent.\n\n300.\n\n*Costs of the Parties' witnesses and experts.* With the exception of the costs arising from the Respondent's application for the forensic inspection of evidence submitted by the Claimant, the Tribunal considers it appropriate for the Claimant to bear the costs arising from the Respondent's presentation of witnesses and experts. The Tribunal accepts that these witnesses and experts were necessary for the Respondent to defend against the Claimant's claims.\n\n301.\n\nIn contrast, the evidence of the forensic experts running to allegation of forgery ended in an impasse, except to the limited extent that the Parties' respective forensic experts were able to reach agreement.506 The Tribunal finds that the Respondent should bear all costs of forensic experts, in the amount of $142,819 (including $26,641 for the Claimant's forensic expert and $116,178 for the Respondent's own experts).\n\nJoint Forensic Expert Report by the Claimant's expert and the Respondent's experts dated 6 February 2014, \u00b6 44.\n\n302.\n\nAccordingly, the Claimant should reimburse the Respondent $214,238, being claimed costs less $116,178.\n\n303.\n\n*Costs of Jurisdictional Objections*. The Tribunal also is of the view that some allowance for costs in the Respondent's favour should be made for its costs of the Jurisdictional Objections, in the context that it accepts it was reasonable for the Respondent to raise the \"no investment\" issue, where the Claimant prevailed, \"but only just.\" Also, the Tribunal accepts that it was reasonable for the Respondent to raise the limitation objection even though it was held over to the merits phase (see Section V.C above).\n\n304.\n\n*Proportionality Issue* *.* The vast disproportion between the Parties' professional costs calls for closer examination.\n\n305.\n\nA State is entitled to full legal service and to incur such legal costs it regards as appropriate for its defence to a BIT claim. However, it does not follow that by reason of being incurred as part of mounting a successful defence all such professional costs and expenses fall to be recouped from the unsuccessful party on an indemnity basis.\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal is inclined to agree with the statement of the *Libananco v. Turkey* tribunal that:\n\nA party with a deep pocket may have its own justification for heavy spending, but it cannot expect to be reimbursed for all its expenditure as a matter of course simply because it is ultimately the prevailing party.507\n\n*Libananco v. Turkey*, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8, Award, 2 September 2011, \u00b6 565.\n\n307.\n\nHere, the Respondent was entitled to defend its interests vigorously, especially within the context of the Claimant's raising exhaustively many and all factual issues enlisted to support his dense factual case. In raising these fact particulars, it became reasonable for the Respondent to mobilize sufficient resources for refutation.\n\n308.\n\nOf greater moment are the issues of proportionality and disparity.\n\n309.\n\nFirst, and without analyzing the Claimant's damages claims, which do not call for determination, the Respondent's costs of legal representation are about 20% of the amount in dispute, including interest.\n\n310.\n\nSecond is the issue of disparity. The Claimant fielded a lean team of two counsel to carry the reference. That was his option, and no reason in itself to confine the Respondent to a corresponding number. For its part, the Respondent engaged six lead counsel, three of whom each had professional fees equal to the entire professional costs incurred by the Claimant; the total of all six is almost five times the comparable Claimant's counsel's fees. Beyond this, a further ten lawyers had costs of some $665,000.\n\n311.\n\nThe number of counsel and hours for which they have been engaged raise squarely the *Libananco* issue, noted in paragraph 306 above, of whether the costs incurred and claimed should fall to be reimbursed to the prevailing party merely because they have been incurred.\n\n312.\n\nThe Tribunal's approach is not to engage in a superficial assessment as to whether the Respondent's costs incurred in its defence were excessive or unreasonable. Rather, the Tribunal is concerned to fix the proportion of these costs that appear reasonable for the Claimant to be ordered to bear having regard to all the factors noted above.\n\n313.\n\nBalancing these competing factors, the decision of the Tribunal is to cap the Respondent's recoverable professional costs claimed of almost $5.2 m. at $2.25 m.\n\n314.\n\n*Other discretionary allowances.* Taking account also of the several other allowances which the Tribunal determines to abate the Claimant's costs on some issues, and also correspondingly to make some allowance in credits referable to some of the Claimant's costs, the Tribunal also abates from the addition of the items and amounts stated above to be allowed as costs the further amount of $250,000.\n\n315.\n\nAccordingly the amount of costs ordered to be paid by the Claimant to the Respondent is fixed at $2,508,144, made up of:\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| 1 Respondent's witness and expert costs as allowed | $214,238 |\n| 2 Respondent's other charges and disbursements | $320,547 |\n| 3 Respondent's professional costs as allowed | $2,250,000 |\n| Total | $2,784,785 |\n| LESS $250,000 allowance |  |\n| LESS $26,641 for Claimant's forensic expert |  |\n| TOTAL | $2,508,144 |\n\n316.\n\n*Conclusion* : The Claimant shall reimburse the Respondent an amount of $567,162 as its costs of arbitration other than costs incurred by the Parties, and an amount of $2,508,144 in respect of costs incurred by the Parties.\n\n**AWARD**\n---------\n\n**For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:**\n\n**A. DISMISSES the Claimant\u2019s claims.**\n\n**B. ORDERS the Claimant to pay to the Respondent the amounts of -**\n\n**(a) USD 567,162 for the costs of arbitration; and**\n\n**(b) USD 2,508,144 for its costs.**"}]}
