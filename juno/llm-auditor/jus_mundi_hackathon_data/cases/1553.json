REASONS FOR DISSENTING**\n-----------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Award rendered by the majority of the Tribunal is essentially ill-founded. The Application pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules (the \"Application\") had to be dismissed for the reasons exposed hereunder.\n\n2.\n\nThe Award of the majority of the Tribunal significantly undermines the requirements of Rule 41(5) aiming at the protection of due process rights of claimants *(i.e.* of investors), and thus unduly favors respondents (*i.e.* States). It not only weakens due process requirements and Rule 41(5) as applied by former ICSID tribunals so far, it also more importantly changes the subtle balance found in investment treaties between the investors\u2019 interests on the one hand, and the States' interests on the other hand: The award of the majority of the Tribunal gives respondents (and thus States) the undue privilege of obtaining, in ICSID arbitration proceedings, the dismissal of claimants in a summary way without that due process rights of claimants (*i.e.* of investors) be complied with.\n\n3.\n\nThe most important duty of arbitral tribunals is to comply with due process requirements, since they ensure that the arbitral tribunal considers and discusses all the parties\u2019 relevant allegations, legal arguments and adduced evidence. An arbitral tribunal failing to comply with due process requirements does not fulfill its mission, in particular when this failure is detrimental to the merits of a party\u2019s claims.\n\n4.\n\nThe obvious specificity of the Application is that it occurs at a very early stage of the proceedings. This specificity of Rule 41(5) has been naturally dealt with by previous ICSID Tribunals which logically held that the standard to be applied for due process requirements is higher than at the end of full-fledged arbitration proceedings. In particular:\n\n- *\"It would in principle be inappropriate to consider and resolve novel issues of law in a summary fashion, which would inevitably limit the Parties\u2019 opportunity to be heard and the Tribunal\u2019s opportunity to reflect* \"1;\n\n- *\"Given the potentially decisive nature of an Article 41(5) objection [...], it is appropriate that claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration be construed liberally and that, in cases of doubt or uncertainty as to the scope of a claimant\u2019s allegation(s), any such doubt or uncertainty should be resolved in favor of the claimant* \"2; and\n\n- *\"It would therefore be a grave injustice if a claimant was wrongly driven from the judgment seat by a final award under Art. 41(5), with no opportunity to develop and present its case under the written and oral procedures prescribed by Rules 29, 31 and 32* \"3.\n\n*PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n9.\n\nTo the extent required to address the Respondent\u2019s Application, and for that limited purpose only, this dissenting opinion briefly conveys the factual background to the dispute as pleaded in the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration. In full compliances with Rule 41(5), the facts mentioned below do not constitute any finding on any facts disputed by the Parties, still less any final findings of fact.\n\n10.\n\nThe dispute opposes the State of Kuwait (\"Kuwait\"), the Respondent, and Almasryia for Operating & Maintaining Touristic Construction Co. L.L.C., the Claimant (\"Almasryia\"), a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Egypt, with the entry number in the Egyptian Commercial Registry 379296.

The latter had purchased this land from Mr. Abdullah Bin Abdelhady Akshan on 2.09.1971 by a virtue of legal deed issued by the judge of Qaisoumia court in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. At this time, this land was located in the Saudi Arabia territory and under the full authority of Saudi Arabian state*\"20.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, page e.\n\n18.\n\nA deed (\"*deed of ownership\",* as mentioned by Claimant in its list of exhibits attached to its Request for Arbitration), *\"No. 412\"* issued on *\"11/7/1319 A.H.\"* (September 2, 1971) by the Judge of Al Qaisoma Court (Saudi Arabia), provides that *\"There appeared before me, [...] Bandar Marzouq Al-Otaibi, known to two present witnesses, and states that he bought the plot located north of Al-Khafji city east Wafra [...] from the so-called Abdullah bin Abdulhadi bin Akshan Al-Akshan[...]*. *By virtue of his ownership of that plot as mentioned above, he sold and assigned the same to the aforesaid person according to the testimony of both of Met\u2019eb bin Awadallah Al-Otaibi and Khalid bin Hanawi Al-Otaibi*\"21.\n\nExhibit C1.\n\n19.\n\nWith respect to the heirs of the late Bandar Marzouq Al-Otaibi, Claimant submitted, with its Request for Arbitration, a December (or September as mentioned in the list of exhibits attached to the Request for Arbitration) 2009 document, issued by the *\"State of Kuwait, Ministry of Justice, Legal Authentication Department, Division of Estate* \"22, stating that \"*in accordance with Succession Limitation no. 1572/2004 + Deeds issued by the Sharia Courts no. 412 -11/7/1391 + draft drawing as per the Deeds no. 412 dated 11/7/1391 A.H., heirs of Bander Marzouq Hazem Al-Otaibi:*\n\n- *Faisal Bander Marzouq Hazem Al-Otaibi [...]: 50%;*\n\n- *Khalid Bander Marzouq Hazem Al.Otaibi [...]: 50%* \"23.\n\nExhibit C2.\n\nExhibit C2.\n\n20.\n\nAs to the sums paid in connection with the JVA, Almasryia explains that \"*the Claimant in order to conclude this agreement spent more than 20 millions USD to purchase the 5% of the land, in addition to the visibility study fees, expert inspection reports and marketing expenses to encourage investors and clients to invest and purchase in its future projects on the land* \"24.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, page e.\n\n21.\n\nThe signed JVA provides that:\n\n\"*the second party [i.e. Claimant] paid 20 000 000 $ (twenty millions USD) for its share in the land and project to the first party [i.e. Al-Otaibi heirs] what is:*\n\n*o the amount of 20 000 000 $dollars received by the first party [i.e. Al-Otaibi heirs] in cash in the date of signing of the contract.*\n\n*o in addition to all the expenses that have been spent in advance in the work of soil sludge and the work of lifting the area and through specialists in the layers of the earth.*\n\n*o expenses and equipment necessary for the establishment of residential and tourist communities.*\n\n*o the cost of preparing feasibility studies on this land.*\n\n*o costs of architectural and construction drawings* \"25 (item 3).\n\nExhibit C5.\n\n22.\n\nAfter allegations in connection with the signing of the JVA, the Request for Arbitration turns to an international convention: \"*On 13.07.1982 the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the State of Kuwait had concluded a convention called - Al-Taef Convention - to put a division line to separate the border of both states and after such convention the claimant\u2019s land was located within the border of the state of Kuwait (appendix no. 6).

SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES\u2019 SUBMISSIONS ON THE APPLICATION**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA. **The Respondent\u2019s Application**\n-----------------------------------\n\n36.\n\nThe Respondent raises three objections in the Application regarding the Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration: first, that the jurisdictional requirement of the *\"six-month cooling off period*\"59 set out in Article 10(2) BIT would not be satisfied, second that *\"there are simply no allegations in the Request for Arbitration that Claimant has sustained damage as a result of war or armed conflict, national emergency or any other events referred to in Article 6 [of the BIT]* \"60*,* and third that \"*the property Claimant alleges has been expropriated from it (a 5% interest in the land) is not, and has never been, owned by Claimant*\"61.\n\nApplication, para 13.\n\nApplication, para. 4.\n\nApplication, para. 5.\n\n1. Jurisdiction\n---------------\n\n37.\n\nIn referring to Article 10(2) BIT, Respondent asserts that *\"Claimant has not only failed to seek an amicable settlement with Respondent during a period of six months prior to submitting the claim to arbitration (as required) but it also failed to notify Respondent of its claim at all prior to filing the Request for Arbitration (also required)*\"62.\n\nApplication, para. 13.\n\n38.\n\nFor Respondent, Claimant\u2019s argument whereby it *\"relies on the above-mentioned proceedings filed by Mr. Al-Otaibi before the Kuwaiti courts (in which Claimant is not a party nor is even mentioned) and correspondence between Mr. Al-Otaibi and the Emir of Kuwait (which similarly does not mention Claimant) or correspondence between Claimant and Mr. Al-Otaibi to argue that Mr. Al-Otaibi had complied, on Claimant\u2019s behalf, with the conditions precedent to the submission of a claim to arbitration provided for in Article 10 of the BIT* \"63, would be *\"frivolous and obviously wrong*\"64.\n\nApplication, para. 14.\n\nApplication, para. 15.\n\n39.\n\nAfter merely citing its own translation of Article 10(2) BIT65, Respondent infers from its wording that *\"Article 10(2) therefore conditions Kuwait's consent to ICSID arbitration on the lapse of a negotiation period of six months following the date on which the investor notifies Kuwait in writing of a dispute under the BIT* \"66.\n\nApplication, para 52.\n\nApplication, para 53.\n\n40.\n\nRespondent also considers that, since Claimant\u2019s name is not mentioned in the correspondence as to the Land sent by Mr. Al-Otaibi to the Kuwaiti authorities, or in Mr. Al-Otaibi\u2019s pleadings before Kuwaiti courts, they cannot be considered as a notification from Claimant to Kuwait regarding a dispute under the BIT67.\n\nApplication, paras 55-58.\n\n2. The claim for the compensation of war damages\n------------------------------------------------\n\n41.\n\nSince Claimant, at the December 14, 2018 hearing, withdrew its claims based on Article 6 BIT68, this issue is not relevant any more.\n\nHearing transcript, page 80 (lines 4-19).\n\n3. Alleged expropriation\n------------------------\n\n42.\n\nFor Respondent, \"*to seek redress for the expropriation of property in any State, a claimant must by necessity first establish that he holds, or has held, ownership rights over that property pursuant to the laws of that State* \"69.\n\nApplication, para. 7.\n\n43.\n\nMore generally, for Respondent, which cites case law and scholars, *\"liability for expropriation under international law is dependent on the existence and nature of the rights allegedly expropriated* \"70.\n\nApplication, para. 50.\n\n44.\n\nRespondent alleges that *\"Claimant\u2019s sole basis for purporting to have the right to assert a claim against Respondent for expropriation of its 5% interest in the Land rests on a Joint Venture Agreement dated 15 May 2019*\"71.\n\nApplication, para 8.\n\n45.\n\nWith respect to the Land, Respondent explains that it \"*is situated in the Kuwaiti region of Wafra* \"72*,* and that *\"this region previously formed part of the so-called neutral zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia (the 'Neutral Zone')*\"73.\n\nApplication, para. 30.\n\nApplication, para. 30.\n\n46.\n\nRespondent further alleges that *\"Kuwait and Saudi Arabia agreed to share 'equal rights' in the Neutral Zone through the 1922 Uqair Convention [...]*\"74.\n\nApplication, para. 31.\n\n47.\n\nRespondent argues that:\n\n*\"In 1965, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia concluded an agreement by which they partitioned the Neutral Zone. [...] The 1965 Agreement entered into force on 26 July 1966*\"75.\n\nApplication, para. 31.\n\n48.\n\nTo support its views as to the 1965 Agreement partitioning the \"Neutral Zone\". Respondent relies on Articles 2. 3 and 16 of this Agreement, which are *\"some relevant provisions on division of the Neutral Zone*\"76.\n\nApplication, para. 31.\n\n49.\n\nWith respect to the 1982 Al-Taef Convention mentioned in the Request for Arbitration as the Convention *\"[putting] a division line to separate the border of both states [Kuwait and Saudi Arabia] and after such convention the claimant\u2019s land was located within the border of the state of Kuwait* \"77. Respondent expresses its disagreement: \"*it is incorrect to state that this agreement 'put a division line to separate the border of both states' as such division line had already been established by the 1965 Agreement*\"78.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, page f.\n\nApplication, para. 33.\n\n50.\n\nIn its Rule 41(5) Application. Respondent also expresses its disagreement as to Claimant\u2019s position whereby, pursuant to the Al-Taef Convention. \"*the State of Kuwait was engaged to register the land and authenticate it with the name of the owner of the land [...] or to compensate with the market price of this land* \"79. Indeed, for Respondent:\n\n\"*[...] the 1982 Al-Taef Agreement sets out procedures in Kuwait that needed to be followed in order for Saudi citizens holding land in the Kuwaiti part of the Neutral Zone to have their property rights over that land recognized under Kuwaiti law. As a Kuwaiti national, these provisions of the Al-Taef Agreement would not have applied to Mr. Al-Otaibi or his brother*\"80.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, page f.\n\nApplication, para. 34.\n\n51.\n\nRespondent further adds that:\n\n\"*as provided by Article 2 of the 1982 Al-Taef Agreement, 'no further application shall be considered after this period [i.e. the three-month period ending 1st September 1982] for any reason'. Therefore this provision makes clear that the right of Saudi citizens to have property rights in the Kuwaiti area of the Neutral Zone recognized under Kuwaiti law would be lost if the right was not invoked within the deadline set out by the 1982 Al-Taef Agreement (i.e. within three months from 1st September 1982) and proved in accordance with the procedures established therein*\"81.\n\nApplication, para. 35.\n\n52.\n\nAs to the judgement of the administrative court mentioned in Claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration, Respondent explains that Mr. Al-Otaibi appealed it82. This appeal was registered in the Kuwait Court of Appeal on March 19, 2015, as per the judgement rendered by this Court83 (page 4).\n\nApplication, para. 42.\n\nExhibit R1.\n\n53.\n\nRespondent adds that \"*on 29 January 2018, the Court of Appeal rejected Mr. Al-Otaibi's appeal*\"84 on the grounds that:\n\na. *\"Mr. Al-Otaibi's request to obtain a Kuwaiti ownership instrument over the land was unfounded [...] for failure to comply with the various provisions of the international agreements and Kuwaiti implementing law concerning the Neutral Zone*\"85; and that\n\nb. \"*the Saudi instrument dated 2 September 1971 brought by Mr. Al-Otaibi as a basis for his petition was later that 26 July 1966, the date of entry into force of the 1965 Agreement, after which date the Land had become Kuwaiti territory and 'part of the Sate properties'*\"86.\n\nApplication, para. 43.\n\nApplication, para. 43.\n\nApplication, para. 43.\n\n54.\n\nThe judgement of the Kuwaiti Court of Appeals submitted by Respondent mentions that \"*the representative of the government has submitted a file which included a copy of the Decision of the Council of Ministers No. 1434 of the year 2010 on the transfer of the authority to the follow-up of the implementation of the agreements of the divided area to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs*\"87 (page 6).\n\nExhibit R1.\n\n55.\n\nWith respect to the merits of the case, the judgement of the Court of appeal held that: \"*the committee has concluded to reject the appellant's request that the deed of the land mentioned above which was purchased from the Saudi citizen is the instrument which has the date of 11/7/1391 Hijri [September 2, 1971] which is later than the date 7/4/1386 Hijri [July 26, 1966], the date of ratification of the treaty between State of Kuwait and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

According to Claimant, \"*Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi as he is our representative before the State of Kuwait sent many complaints to the Prince of the State of Kuwait [...] in which it was clearly stated our intention to solve the disputes by arbitration before ICSID if it is not solved by the State (c-8.1), see the last line of the letter of 8/12/2014 [...]*\"96.\n\nd. Claimant added that *\"[i]n addition to the above-mentioned letter [...], our agent, Mr. Faisal Bander Al-Otaibi, sent two letters on behalf of himself and heirs and on behalf of the Claimant and for its interest dated 10 April 2016 [...] to the Director General of the Municipality requesting to register the land [...] or otherwise the arbitration proceedings will be taken before ICSID [...] (c-8.2)*\"97.\n\ne.

Legal basis for Claimant's claim, including expropriation\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nIn its Observations, Claimant provides a list of legal provisions which it considers to be \"*its legal basis for its claim against the State of Kuwait* \"112;\n\na. Article 1(1)(b), (c) and (e) BIT to allege that the definition of investment is met (Claimant *\"invested its money in the purchase of 5% of the entire plot of land [...] in the establishment of touristic and residential buildings* \"113);\n\nb. Article 1(3) BIT (definition of investment proceeds *\"which relates to the Claimant investment revenues and profits that have been lost due to the expropriation [...] and not enabling the owner (the Claimant) to exercise its investment activity as an owner to benefit from its revenues* \"114);\n\nc. Article 1(5) BIT to allege that \"*the land subject of this case is located in the territory of the State of Kuwait after the signing of the Al-Taef Convention* \"115;\n\nd. Article 2(2) BIT which provides that the contracting states have the duty to provide the investments and the activities linked to them with the necessary permissions, approvals and authorisations116;\n\ne. Article 3(1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) BIT aiming at the protection of investments (nondiscrimination, right of recourse to courts, no discriminatory restriction as to purchase of products necessary or useful for production, no performance requirements which are not justified by public interest, no expropriation breaching principles of international law, full compliance with commitments to which Kuwait is a party)117.\n\nObservations, page 8.\n\nObservations, page 9.\n\nObservations, page 9.\n\nObservations, page 9.\n\nObservations, pages 9-10.\n\nObservations, pages 10-11.\n\n63.\n\nWith respect to these BIT provisions, Claimant explains that *\"the State of Kuwait has breached all its obligations under the preceding articles, obstructed the exercise of the claimant\u2019s investments, expropriated its land and did not enable it to register its ownership in government departments [...]* \"118.\n\nObservations, page 11.\n\n64.\n\nClaimant also alleges that the most-favored nation clause, provided for in Article 5 BIT, setting forth a \"*no less favorable treatment accorded [by a Contracting State] in comparable circumstances to investments made by its own investors, or by investors of any third state\",* was *\"violated [...] when it [Kuwait] granted both Saudi and Kuwaiti citizens full compensation for the expropriation of their lands\"*119.\n\nObservations, page 11.\n\n65.\n\nClaimant also provides details as to the legal basis for its expropriation claim as expressed in its Request for Arbitration120. It relies in particular on:\n\na. Article 7(3) BIT, providing that the term \"expropriation\" also includes the interference of a Contracting State with an enterprise in which an investor belonging to the other Contracting State has a majority or important share121; and on\n\nb. Article 7(4) BIT which provides that the term \"expropriation\" includes *\"other similar procedures having the same effect of seizing the property or expropriating if* \"122.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, page f.\n\nObservations, page 13.\n\nObservations, page 13.\n\n66.\n\nClaimant provides details as to the clauses of the JVA dealing with the rights allegedly expropriated:\n\n- *\"In this agreement, the Claimant (the second party) purchased 5% of the Kuwaiti land owned by the first party for an amount of $20 million [...] to invest in this land to establish such constructions and touristic resorts and to obtain 10% of all profits gained from land and constructions (item 1,3 of the agreement c-5)*\"123; and\n\n- *\"In this agreement, the first party committed to guarantee the transfer of the land and the share of the ownership of the land to the Claimant and to issue a deed from the State of Kuwait in the name of the Claimant [...] (item 5 of the agreement c-5)*\"124.\n\nObservations, pages 4 and 23.\n\nObservations, page 4.\n\n67.\n\nWith respect to the Saudi deed of ownership adduced in evidence by Claimant125, it adds, in its Observations, that:\n\na. *\"Mr. Faisal Bandar Al-Otaibi and his brother are the heirs of the late Bandar Al-Otaibi (c-2), who had purchased this land from Mr. Abdullah bin Abdelhady Akshan (Saudi nationality) on 2/9/1971 by virtue of a legal deed issued by the judge of Qaisoumia court in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (c-1). [...] Mr. Abdullah bin Abdelhady Akshan (Saudi nationality) was the owner of the land under the title deed issued by King Saud in the year 1900 and the Royal Decree of 1965 in accordance with the content to the judgment of Qaisoumia Court (c-1).[...] And no one claims otherwise. Therefore, the sequence of ownership of this land until it reached the plaintiff is true and no doubt of that*\"126.\n\nb. Claimant also argues that the Saudi deed \"*has been legally issued and has been ratified and approved by the Saudi court and stamped and ratified by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia [...], and there is no other judgements, laws or decisions in Saudi Arabia ignoring or denying this deed*\"127. Claimant also exlains that *\"transferring of sovereignty does not mean that the owner of the land has lost ownership*\"128.\n\nExhibit C1.\n\nObservations, pages 23 and 24.\n\nObservations, page 5.\n\nObservations, page 24.\n\n68.\n\nFor Claimant, the Kuwaiti authorities\u2019 refusal to grant title to the Land to Mr. Al-Otaibi is based on two grounds:\n\na. pursuant to the meeting *\"minutes of the final report of the Studying Committee Concerning the Claims and Allegations of Kuwaiti Citizens in Zour and Wafra areas no 6/2011*\"129,  referred to in the judgement of the Kuwaiti administrative court130*(\"c-4 p4 para 2[3]* \"131),  the ground for refusing to grant a Kuwaiti title to the Land to Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi was as follows: *\"article 2 of the Al-Taef Agreement (c-6) [...] stipulated that the government of Kuwait shall open the registration of requests [...] starting from the first of September 1982 for a period of 3 months [...], further requests shall not be considered for any reason* \"132.\n\nb. Pursuant to the judgement rendered by the Kuwaiti Court of Appeal133*(\"p8 para 2 & p9* \"134) as to the Land, and pursuant to the minutes of the final report of the Studying Committee Concerning the Claims and Allegations of Kuwaiti Citizens in Zour and Wafra areas no 6/2011135*(\"c-11 p4 para 1&3* \"136), *\"the instrument issued for the land mentioned in the case of Mr. Faisal Bandr Al-Otaibi was issued on 2/9/1971, after 8/6/1966 the date of ratification of the partition agreement* \"137.\n\nObservations, page 19.\n\nExhibit C4.\n\nObservations, page 19.\n\nObservations, page 20.\n\nExhibit R1.\n\nObservations, page 20.\n\nExhibit C11.\n\nObservations, page 20.\n\nObservations, page 20.\n\n69.\n\nClaimant relies on the following reasoning to conclude that the grounds put forward by the Kuwaiti authorities to refuse to issue a Kuwaiti title for the Land on the basis of the Saudi deed is *\"an injustice committed by the Respondent* \"138;\n\na. *\"The Saudi Court cannot issue a deed of ownership of a land not located in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as for the ratification issued by the Saudi Government* \"139.\n\nb. Notwithstanding the transfer of sovereignty to Kuwait, Kuwait must comply with the ownership rights *(\"under these two international conventions [the 1965 Agreement and the Al-Taef Convention], this land was transferred to the Kuwaiti state bearing its obligations which are the ownership of Mr. Faisal Bandar Al-Otaibi* \"140).\n\nc. *\"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s government and courts said that Mr. Faisal Bandar Al-Otaibi is the owner of this land [...], and no other owner put his hand on it*\"141.\n\nd. Claimant refers, in its Observations142, to two decisions143 of the Kuwaiti Council of Ministers: The first one, dated October 16, 1983 states that engineering measures of the State of Kuwait *\"will eventually result in the expropriation of all residential and non-residential areas in the old villages of Al-Wafra and Al-Zour*\"144; the second one, dated May 29, 1995, was about the issuance of *\"documents of real estate ownership of Saudi citizens*\"145.\n\ne. Claimant cites a Kuwaiti court case:\n\ni. Claimant describes the case as follows: it is about a *\"final and binding judgement which has been issued by the Kuwaiti court in favor of Mr. Juman Salim Al-Dosari who holds a title deed from the Saudi government dated 9/3/1388 A.H. for the year of 1968 in the same area as the Claimant land*\"146. Claimant further adds that Mr. Al-Dosari's land was purchased from a *\"Saudi person during year 1968, after the signing of the 1966 Agreement*\"147.\n\nIn this respect, the judgment of the Kuwaiti *\"Primary Court*\"148 dated November 14, 2011 submitted by Claimant with its Observations, held that: *\"Nasser Salim Nasser Ali Al-Dosari, Kuwaiti Nationality, owned a property [...] in Al-Zour area in the petitioned neutral zone between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia under the original instrument [...] registered No. 114/m on 9/3/1388 A.H. purchased from Salem Fnkhor bin Mohammed Alkatheri (Saudi nationality)*\"149 (pages 1-2), and *\"it's proved to the court that [...] the dispute is over an empty land located[...] in Al-Zour area, which plaintiffs own in common under a deed of title issued by the Saudi Sharia Court No. 114m.s.67, which was expropriated for the Neutral Zone between the State of Kuwait and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, [...] which is estimated at KD 45,000 (forty five thousand Kuwaiti Dinars)* \"150 (page 4 of translation).\n\nii. In its judgment, the Kuwaiti \"Primary Court\" *\"ruled: [...] Second: obligating the second plaintiff [Kuwaiti Ministry of Finance] to grant the plaintiffs an amount of KD 45,000 (forty five Kuwaiti Dinars)* \"151 (page 5 of translation).\n\niii. On February 28, 2012, the Kuwaiti Court of Appeal rejected the appeals filed against the decision of November 14, 2011 of the \"Primary Court\"152.\n\niv. On June 26, 2013, the Kuwaiti Cassation Court rejected an appeal filed against the February 28, 2012 decision of the Court of Appeal153.\n\nv. As to the grounds relied on by the Kuwaiti courts to indemnify Mr. Al-Dosari for the expropriated land, Claimant contends that they *\"ruled that the dates contained in the Al-Taef Agreement had no law to govern and could not be invoked* \"154.\n\nIn this respect, as the Kuwaiti authorities objected that Mr. Al-Dosari's claim should be held inadmissible since it would have been untimely, the Kuwaiti Court of Appeal held, in its February 28, 2012 decision, that \"*the law does not specify special dates for the claims to be observed*\"155 (page 11 of translation). It shall be noted that the Kuwaiti Court of Cassation did not address this issue in its June 26, 2013 decision.\n\nvi. With respect to the Al-Dosari case, Claimant concludes that the two decisions \"*are contradictory, one of them against Mr. [...] Al-Otaibi and another to the favor of Mr. [...] Al-Dosari* \"156, even though they *\"speak of the same subject and respond to the same objections raised from the State of Kuwait* \"157.\n\nObservations, page 21.\n\nObservations, page 22.\n\nObservations, page 22.\n\nObservations, page 22.\n\nObservations, page 22.\n\nExhibits C12 and C13.\n\nExhibits C12.\n\nExhibits C13.\n\nObservations, page 22.\n\nObservations, page 22.\n\nClaimant\u2019s list of documents adduced in evidence under Exhibit C10, describes this document as *\"Ruling of the primary court on the right of Al-Dosari in compensation\",* even though the translation describes it as a judgment of the *\"Supreme Court\".*\n\nExhibit C10.\n\nExhibit C10.\n\nExhibit C10.\n\nExhibit C10.\n\nExhibit C10.\n\nObservations, page 23.\n\nExhibit C10.\n\nObservations, page 23.\n\nObservations, page 23.\n\n70.\n\nClaimant, in its Observations, confirms Respondent\u2019s allegation whereby the dispute with the State of Kuwait as to the Land is now *\"before the Court of Cassation in the State of\u2019Kuwait*\"158,  and adds that the decisions rendered so far are \"*not final and binding neither on Mr. Faisal Bandar Al-Otaibi [...]*\"159.\n\nObservations, page 20.\n\nObservations, page 20.\n\n71.\n\nClaimant explains that Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi did not follow the specific procedure for registration of ownership provided for in Article 2 of the Al-Taef Convention for two reasons:\n\na. Because the size of the Land excluded such procedure: The application for the registration of ownership by Kuwait was open for *\"land that does not exceed 2500 square meters only*\"160 pursuant to Article 2 of the Al-Taef Convention, while *\"Mr. Faisal Bandar Al-Otaibi's property is 800,000 square meters* \"161.\n\nb. Because the date of the property deed (1971) as to the Land excluded the procedure provided for by the Al-Taef Agreement: The registration of ownership by Kuwait was open for *\"land that have officially fixed date before 26 July 1966*\"162 (Article 2 of the Al-Taef Convention).\n\nObservations, page 21.\n\nObservations, page 21.\n\nObservations, page 21.\n\n72.\n\nClaimant summarizes its money award claim as follows: *\"The Claimant seeks that the Tribunal issues a judgement against the Respondent to pay an amount of 320 million US dollars to remedy all related damages occurred to the Claimant for losing its profit and for all expenditures on feasibility studies, experts reports, administrative fees, litigation and arbitration fees*\"163.\n\nObservations, pages 24 and 25.\n\n73.\n\nWith respect to the compensation of damages related to expropriation of the 5% of the Land specifically, Almasryia argues that *\"Claimant owned 5% of the land which equal to 4 millions meter. Claimant seeks the appointment of an expert to evaluate the market price of the land in order to compensate Claimant*\"164.\n\nObservations, page 24.\n\n74.\n\nClaimant\u2019s prayer for relief, as contained in its Observations, is as follows:\n\n*\"First: Accept the Claimant\u2019s claim in form and subject.*\n\n*Second: The rejection of the objection submitted by Respondent on 3 September 2018 in form and in subject matter.*\n\n*Third: Determining the right of the Claimant to ownership of the land.*\n\n*Fourth: Appointment of an expert to assess the value of the disputed land [...].*\n\n*Fifth: order the Respondent to pay an amount of 320 millions US dollars to remedy all related damages occurred to the Claimant for losing its profit and for all expenditures on feasibility studies, experts reports, administrative fees, litigation and arbitration fees*\"165.\n\nObservations, page 25.\n\n**IV. LEGAL REASONING**\n-----------------------\n\nA. **Scope and standard of Rule 41(5)**\n---------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nRule 41(5) provides that:\n\n*Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal, and in any event before the first session of the Tribunal, file an objection that a claim is manifestly without legal merit. The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.*\n\n76.\n\nPrevious ICSID tribunals have considered Rule 41(5)\u2019s expedited procedure and commented upon the rules and the standard to be applied under the provision. The Parties refer to these interpretations in this arbitration166, and there is no reason not to regard the decisions of prior ICSID tribunals as highly relevant and material to its consideration of the Application. This is also the opinion expressed in the award of the majority of the Tribunal167.\n\nApplication, paras 20-26; Hearing Transcript, page 54 (line 25), page 55 (lines 1-4), page 56 (lines 18-25), page 57 (lines 1-4).\n\nAward, III.B.\n\n77.\n\nAs provided for by Rule 41(5), the party raising a Rule 41(5) objection must *\"specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection\".* The objection shall be dismissed if *\"Respondent has not satisfied the applicable standard of proof in regard of its [...] objections under Rule 41(5)* \"168.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 92.\n\n78.\n\nSeveral ICSID tribunals have found that *\"manifest,\"* as used in Rule 41(5), is equivalent to *\"obvious\"* or *\"clearly revealed to the eye, mind or judgment*\"169. Under Rule 41(5), the respondent must establish its objection *\"clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch*\"170. The Rule is intended to capture cases which are clearly and unequivocally unmeritorious171, and as such, the standard that a respondent must meet under Rule 41(5) is very demanding and rigorous172.\n\n*Trans-Global,* para. 83; *Global Trading Resource Corp. v. Ukraine (\"Global Trading\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/09/11, Award, 1 December 2010, para. 35.\n\n*Trans-Global,* para. 88; *Brandes Investment Partners LP v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (\"Brandes Investment\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/3, Decision on the Respondent\u2019s objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 2 February 2009, para. 63; *Global Trading,* Para. 35.\n\n*Brandes Investment,* Para. 62.\n\n*Trans-Global,* Para. 88; *Brandes Investment,* Para. 63; *Global Trading,* para. 35.\n\n79.\n\n*\"Rule 41(5) is not intended to resolve novel, difficult or disputed legal issues, but instead only to apply undisputed or genuinely indisputable rules of law to uncontested facts* \"173. *\"It would in principle be inappropriate to consider and resolve novel issues of law in a summary fashion, which would inevitably limit the Parties' opportunity to be heard and the Tribunal's opportunity to reflect* \"174. Claimant relies on a similar rule: *\"Rule 41(5) should not by any means lead to affect negatively the duty of the Tribunal in maintaining the due process*\"175.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea*, para. 89.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 94.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 59 (lines 5-7).\n\n80.\n\nIn considering the scope of a Rule 41(5) objection *(i.e.,* the scope of the phrase *\"without legal merit*\"), ICSID tribunals have found that objections should be based on legal impediments to claims, rather than factual ones176. Given the preliminary nature of the proceeding, a tribunal considering a Rule 41(5) application may not be in a position to decide upon disputed facts177.\n\n*Trans-Global*, para. 97.\n\n*Trans-Global*, para. 97.\n\n81.\n\nFurther, as the Respondent\u2019s Rule 41(5) objections concern both matters of jurisdiction and merits, it shall be noted that Rule 41(5) allows for objections related both to jurisdiction and the merits of the case178. Nonetheless, the very demanding standard of proof outlined above applies no less to jurisdictional than other matters179.\n\n*Brandes Investment,* Para. 55; *Global Trading,* para. 30.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 91.\n\n82.\n\nAlso, *\"given the potentially decisive nature of an Article 41(5) objection [...], it is appropriate that claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration be construed liberally and that, in cases of doubt or uncertainty as to the scope of a claimant\u2019s allegation(s), any such doubt or uncertainty should be resolved in favor of the claimant* \"180. *\"It would therefore be a grave injustice if a claimant was wrongly driven from the judgement seat by a final award under Art. 41(5), with no opportunity to develop and present its case under the written and oral procedures prescribed by Rules 29, 31 and 32*\"181.\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v. Grenada,* para. 6.1.3.\n\n*Trans-Global,* para. 92.\n\nB. **The Respondent\u2019s Objections**\n----------------------------------\n\n83.\n\nConsidering the Parties\u2019 written and oral submissions on the Application, the Respondent has not satisfied the applicable standard of proof in respect of its objections under Rule 41(5) - i.e. that of *\"manifest\"* lack of legal merit. As such, the Respondent\u2019s Application had to be dismissed.\n\n84.\n\nAs outlined above, the Respondent\u2019s objections concern, inter alia, the interpretation of both Kuwaiti domestic legislation, the BIT and other international treaties. Since Respondent contends that Claimant would not have been represented by Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi before the Kuwaiti authorities, the Respondent\u2019s objections also call for a factual analysis of whether we can exclude that Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi acted on behalf of Claimant before the Kuwaiti authorities. Such factual analysis shall also determine whether we can exclude any act(s) amounting to the expropriation of rights of Claimant. None of these matters is appropriate for resolution under Rule 41(5).\n\n85.\n\nThe factual circumstances of this case are relatively unusual, and Respondent\u2019s objections raise novel issues of law with respect to the BIT, in particular with respect to Art. 10 BIT, the 1965 Agreement and the Al-Taef Convention, which have never been applied so far. Consistent with this, Respondent did not refer to any decision issued by an international court or arbitral tribunal applying these three international instruments to a claim for compensation of damages caused by the alleged expropriation of rights. It is inappropriate to consider and resolve novel issues of law in a summary fashion, which would inevitably limit the Parties\u2019 opportunity to be heard and the Tribunal\u2019s opportunity to reflect. That is particularly true where those issues are disputed and potentially complex. The ICSID tribunal in *PNG v. Papua New Guinea* also faced a Rule 41(5) objection where the tribunal had to apply the host state\u2019s legislation and international conventions, and the parties also disagreed as to the interpretation and application of these legislation and conventions: The tribunal held that interpretation of domestic legislation and international conventions \"*in a summary Rule 41(5) procedure would be inappropriate* \"182.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 95.\n\n86.\n\nDespite *PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* and even though the Award of the majority of the Tribunal183 cites a case where an ICSID tribunal held that a Rule 41(5) summary procedure is not intended to address complicated, difficult or unsettled issues of law, the Award184 goes through a long and complex interpretation of the wording of Art. 10 BIT, of the presumed purpose of this provision, of previous awards (which lacked uniformity) applying similar provisions, and even has to expressly *\"disagree with the views expressed in the cases referred to by the Claimant* \"185, to come to its conclusion that Art. 10 BIT would provide for mandatory prior consultations between the investor and Kuwait. As in *PNG v. Papua New Guinea, \"doing so in a summary Rule 41(5) procedure [is] inappropriate* \"186.\n\nAward, par. 32.\n\nAward, par. 37 to 43.\n\nAward, par. 43.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 95.\n\n87.\n\nFurthermore, the Award presents a contradiction: While it cites a previous arbitral tribunal case holding that a Rule 41(5) summary procedure is not intended to address unsettled issues of law, it implicitly admits that the issue in connection with Art. 10 BIT is unsettled since the award has to express, in its rather long reasoning, the majority of the Tribunal\u2019s disagreement with the ICSID cases cited by Claimant.\n\n88.\n\nFurther, Respondent, except for previous ICSID cases holding that prior consultations were mandatory under certain investment treaties other than the BIT, never raised the complex reasoning used in the Award by the majority of the Tribunal, being highlighted that: As provided for by Rule 41(5), the party raising a Rule 41(5) objection must *\"specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection\",* and the objection shall be dismissed if *\"Respondent has not satisfied the applicable standard of proof in regard of its [...] objections under Rule 41(5)* \"187. Consequently, since Respondent did not raise the complex sequence of arguments used in the Award to conclude that consultations would be mandatory under Art. 10 BIT, its objection in this regard had to be dismissed.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 92.\n\n89.\n\nAlso, the Award188 goes through a complicated, and barely understandable, interpretation of Art. 7 BIT, which has never been applied so far, and of various ICSID cases, to assert that exclusively a *\"property title* \"189 can be subject to expropriation (while the wording itself of Art. 7 BIT has, *prima facie* at least, a larger scope as to the rights protected, since it provides *e.g.* that *\"investments [...] shall not be subject to nationalisation, expropriation\"* and that the *\"majority or substantial interest in [an] investment\"* can be subject expropriation).\n\nAward, par. 52 to 56.\n\nAward, par. 55.\n\n90.\n\nThe fact that Respondent\u2019s objections raise novel issues of law, which cannot be decided upon within the frame of Rule 41(5) proceedings, and the fact that Respondent did not raise the arguments developed by the majority of the Tribunal, are not the only reasons which should have led to the dismissal of its objections. Additional reasons are exposed hereafter.\n\n1. Jurisdiction\n---------------\n\n91.\n\nArt. 10 BIT does not expressly provide that the lack of prior notification of a claim would prevent the investor from initiating ICSID arbitration.\n\n92.\n\nIn this respect, it shall be noted that Respondent, with the purpose to demonstrate that Article 10 BIT would provide for a mandatory six-month \"cooling-off period\", considered necessary to list cases190 in which the mandatory nature of a negotiation period prior to arbitration was recognized, but which relate to investment treaties signed by Argentina, Turkmenistan, Ecuador and Turkey, and not by Kuwait and Egypt. It is Respondent\u2019s only reasoning as to the allegedly mandatory notification and six-month \"cooling-off period\". Respondent fails to compare, for interpretation purposes, the wording of Article 10 BIT with the wording of the alleged similar clauses of the other treaties cited by Respondent, the wording of these clauses being different from the wording of Article 10(2) BIT. Respondent thus fails to demonstrate that Article 10 BIT would be *\"obviously\"* (as required by Rule 41(5)) mandatory. Respondent does not put forward any other reason why the wording of Article 10 BIT would make it mandatory for Claimant to notify its claim to Kuwait, and then to wait six months before initiating legal proceedings versus Kuwait.\n\nApplication, para 54.\n\n93.\n\nThe Award of the majority of the Tribunal agrees implicitly, but clearly, that the wording of Art. 10 BIT does not provide *per se* that the lack of prior consultations would prevent the investor from initiating ICSID arbitration. Indeed, the Award191, to reach its conclusion as to the mandatory nature of consultations, goes through a complex interpretation of the wording of Art. 10 BIT, of the presumed purpose of this provision, and of previous awards (which lacked uniformity) applying similar provisions.\n\nAward, par. 37 to 43.\n\n94.\n\nClaimant relied192, during the December 14, 2018 hearing, on *SGS v. Pakistan*193 and *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania*194, in which ICSID arbitral tribunals held that consultation mechanisms provided for in the applicable bilateral investment treaties were not mandatory. As quoted by Claimant during the hearing195, the ICSID tribunal in *Gauff v. Tanzania* explained the rationale of the non-mandatory nature of the considered \"cooling-off period\":\n\n*\"Non-compliance with the six month period, therefore, does not preclude this Arbitral Tribunal from proceeding. If it did so, the provision would have curious effects, including:*\n\n*- preventing the prosecution of a claim, and forcing the claimant to do nothing until six months have elapsed, even where further negotiations are obviously futile, or settlement obviously impossible for any reason;*\n\n*- forcing the claimant to recommence an arbitration started too soon, even if the six-month period has elapsed by the time the Arbitral Tribunal considers the matter* \"196.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 77 (lines 9-25) and page 78 (lines 1-10).\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan (\"SGS v. Pakistan\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003, para. 184.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania (\"Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania\"),* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 18 July 2008, paras 343-347.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 78 (lines 1-10).\n\n*Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania,* para. 343.\n\n95.\n\nRespondent has not denied that negotiations would be futile, or settlement impossible. On the contrary, Respondent has adopted the view that Claimant\u2019s claims are abusive:\n\n*\"We submit that this case is one that proves that the system is being clearly abused by Claimants that file frivolous claims. We ask you to send a strong message that this abusive use of the investor state dispute settlement system will not be tolerated*\"197.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 123 (lines 15-19)\n\n96.\n\nThus, Respondent not only fails to demonstrate that Article 10 BIT would be *\"obviously\"* (as required by Rule 41(5)) a mandatory consultation mechanism, but it also does not contend and does not demonstrate, with the high standard required by Rule 41(5), that negotiations would not be futile and that a settlement would not be impossible. Further, by arguing that, with the initiation of arbitral proceedings, the *\"system is clearly abused by Claimant*\"198, Respondent considers implicitly, but clearly, that consultations would be deprived of any chance of success.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 123 (lines 15-19)\n\n97.\n\nThe Award of the majority of the Tribunal does not address the issue, raised by Claimant, of the futility of consultations. This failure to comply with due process requirements, which is detrimental to Claimant, is all the more serious as the Award199 contains an entire sequence of reasoning supporting Respondent\u2019s views as to the mandatory nature of consultations, while this sequence of arguments has not been raised by Respondent.\n\nAward, par. 37 to 43.\n\n98.\n\nIn addition to its arguments whereby Art. 10 BIT would not provide for any mandatory consultation mechanism, and whereby such consultations would be obviously futile and a settlement impossible in the present case, Claimant maintained, during the hearing200, that it nevertheless had complied with the six-month \"cooling-off period\". Claimant relies on item 5 of the JVA to contend201 that Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi was empowered to represent it before the Kuwaiti authorities for formalities to be carried out in compliance with the JVA (Exhibit C5), it relies202 on a letter dated January 15, 2011 (Exhibit C9) to allege that it gave instructions to Mr. Al-Otaibi to inform Kuwait of its intention to initiate arbitral proceedings *\"before ICSID* \"203, and it invokes204 a letter dated April 10, 2016 (Exhibit C8) from Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi *\"in his capacity as an agent for the partners*\"205, to the Kuwaiti authorities informing them of an \"*arbitration*\"206.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 78 (lines 17-25).\n\nObservations, pages 5 and 16.\n\nObservations, page 5 and 16 ; Hearing Transcript, page 78 (lines 19-20).\n\nExhibit C9.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 69 (lines 13-23).\n\nExhibit C8.\n\nExhibit C8.\n\n99.\n\nRespondent does not explain how one could exclude, *\"obviously\"\"* as required by Rule 41(5), already at this early stage of the arbitral proceedings, the fact alleged by Claimant whereby Mr. Al-Otaibi would have acted in the name of Claimant, being reminded that Claimant is entitled to submit further allegations and evidence at a later stage of the proceedings and that it declared at the end of the December 14, 2018 hearing, its intention to adduce other documents in evidence207.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 125 (lines 13-19), page 126 (lines 5-11).\n\n100.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, Respondent denies that Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi would have represented Claimant before Kuwaiti authorities to inform them of Claimant\u2019s intent to initiate arbitration against Kuwait. However, Claimant does not mention any private international law provision, or case law, designating the law applicable to representation, and it fails to allege the legal provision(s) which, to its opinion, would exclude valid representation powers. Thus, by failing to mention which legal provision, or case law, would exclude, *\"obviously\"\"* as required by Rule 41(5), that Mr. Faisal Al-Otabi would have had valid representation powers and would have validly acted on behalf of Claimant, Respondent \"*has not satisfied the applicable standard of proof in regard of its [...] objections under Rule 41(5)*\"208*,* and, pursuant to *PNG v. Papua New Guinea*209*,* its objection as to Art. 10 BIT must be dismissed for this additional reason.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 92.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 92.\n\n101.\n\nLike Respondent\u2019s reasoning, the Award fails to state which private international law provisions and which substantive law provisions would lead to the conclusion that Claimant would not have been validly represented by Mr. Al-Otaibi for the notification of Claimant\u2019s claim to Respondent. Concluding, despite this significant legal deficiency, that *\"there is a legal impediment which goes to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal*\"210, breaches Rule 41(5) which requires that the reason for a summary dismissal must be \"*obvious*\": a legal argument cannot be obvious if the applicable legal provisions are unknown. Further, the Award\u2019s reasoning, by failing to conclude that Respondent \"*has not satisfied the applicable standard of proof in regard of its [...] objections under Rule 41(5)* \"211 with respect to the representation issue, breaches another requirement of Rule 41(5).\n\nAward, par. 47.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 92.\n\n102.\n\nAnd the Award does not comply with due process requirements in connection with this representation issue. Indeed it concludes that it *\"is manifest, clear and obvious* \"212 that no exhibits support Claimant\u2019s allegations as to representation, while Claimant declared at the end of the December 14, 2018 hearing, its intention to adduce other documents in evidence213. The Tribunal can certainly not decide in advance that the exhibits, whose content is not known to the Tribunal, and which Claimant intends to adduce in evidence, do not support Claimant\u2019s allegations. This is also a breach of Rule 41(5), since it is \"*a grave injustice if a claimant was wrongly driven from the judgment seat by a final award under Art. 41(5), with no opportunity to develop and present its case under the written and oral procedures prescribed by Rules 29, 31 and 32* \"214.\n\nAward, par. 47.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 125 (lines 13-19), page 126 (lines 5-11).\n\n*Trans-Global,* para. 92.\n\n103.\n\nConsequently, Respondent\u2019s objection as to Art. 10 BIT had to be dismissed as it fails to demonstrate that, *\"obviously\"* (as required by Rule 41(5)), Art. 10 BIT would be a mandatory consultation mechanism, that consultations would not be futile, and that Claimant was not validly represented by Mr. Al-Otaibi.\n\n2. Alleged expropriation\n------------------------\n\n104.\n\nWith respect to Respondent\u2019s argument whereby Claimant would not be the owner of the Land, the interpretation of the 1964 Agreement and of the Al-Taef Convention are central, since Respondent considers that Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi would have never been the owner of that Land and could consequently not have transferred the ownership of this Land to Claimant because the 1964 Agreement would have transferred sovereignty over the Land from Saudi Arabia to Kuwait in 1965 (while Claimant considers that sovereignty over the Land would have been transferred after 1971, which is the year of the deed of the Saudi Court which would prove that Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi\u2019s father became the owner of the Land). Each of the following reasons excludes that the interpretation of the 1965 Agreement and the Al-Taef Convention be carried out within the frame of a Rule 41(5) objection:\n\na. The interpretation of the 1964 Agreement and of the Al-Taef Convention is a complex novel issue of law, and *\"Rule 41(5) is not intended to resolve novel, difficult or disputed legal issues, but instead only to apply undisputed or genuinely indisputable rules of law* \"215. because \"*it would in principle be inappropriate to consider and resolve novel issues of law in a summary fashion, which would inevitably limit the Parties\u2019 opportunity to be heard and the Tribunal\u2019s opportunity to reflect* \"216. This is one of the arguments Claimant relied on: *\"Rule 41(5) should not by any means lead to affect negatively the duty of the Tribunal in maintaining the due process* \"217.\n\nb. Respondent first explained that \"*the purported sale of the Land to Mr. Al-Otaibi\u2019s father and issuance of the Saudi instrument in 1971 occurred more than six years after the Land had already become Kuwaiti territory pursuant to the 1965 Agreement*\"218. Respondent changed its argument when it explained later, during the December 14, 2018 hearing, that the demarcation between the two countries in the former neutral zone was agreed-upon in 1969 only. Indeed, as then argued by Respondent, \"*the 1965 treaty did establish the division of the neutral zone. It called for the demarcation to be carried out pursuant to a procedure. The procedure was carried out, and confirmed in a supplementary agreement which was signed at Kuwait on 18th December 1969* \"219. Respondent did not submit the text of the *\"supplementary agreement\"* to the Tribunal and did not state the date of its entry into force. Further, it failed itself to present an univocal position as to the date when sovereignty on the Land was transferred to Kuwait, and, moreover, Claimant expresses a third position with a sovereignty transfer after 1971. Consequently and obviously, the requirement according to which *\"Rule 41(5) is not intended to resolve [...] difficult or disputed legal issues, but instead only to apply undisputed or genuinely indisputable rules of law*\"220 is not complied with.\n\nc. Both Claimant221 and Respondent222 alleged, in their briefs, that Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi and his co-heir appealed the judgement of the Kuwaiti Court of Appeals before the Kuwaiti Court of Cassation and that no decision had been rendered. Both Claimant223 and Respondent224 confirmed, during the December 14, 2018 hearing, that the Kuwaiti Court of Cassation had not rendered any decision. Because of the pending proceedings before the Kuwaiti Court of Cassation, Claimant argues that *\"the judgements are not yet final or binding* \"225. The reality is that Respondent fails to demonstrate that Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi's ownership is, *\"obviously\"* as required by Rule 41(5), excluded: Of course, nobody can exclude that the Kuwaiti Court of Cassation renders a decision in favor of Mr. Al-Otaibi (and Respondent did not allege that such decision would be excluded).\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 89.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 94.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 59 (lines 5-7).\n\nApplication, para. 37.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 95 (lines 19-23).\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 89.\n\nObservations, page 20.\n\nApplication, para. 44.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 71 (lines 15-22).\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 20 (lines 16-18).\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 71 (lines 21-22).\n\n105.\n\nWith respect to the Saudi deed itself, and the various owners of the Land over time, Respondent fails to give any explanations as to the following arguments raised by Claimant:\n\na. For Claimant, the Saudi deed *\"has been legally issued and has been ratified and approved by the Saudi court and stamped and ratified by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and there is no other judgements, laws or decisions in Saudi Arabia ignoring or denying this deed* \"226*.* The mere existence of the 1971 deed issued by the Saudi Court as to the ownership of the Land renders Respondent's position in this regard troubling: Respondent fails to explain why a Saudi Court would have issued an ownership deed in 1971 if, as contended by Respondent, the Land would have been located in 1971 on the Kuwaiti territory (what Respondent also failed to demonstrate pursuant to the requirements of Rule 41(5), as explained *supra).* Respondent thus fails, for this additional reason, to demonstrate that, *\"obviously\"\"* as required by Rule 41(5), the deed should be totally disregarded by the Tribunal.\n\nb. Respondent does not deny that, in the Al-Dosari case, as alleged by Claimant:\n\ni. A *\"final and binding judgement which has been issued by the Kuwaiti court in favor of Mr. Juman Salim Al-Dosari who holds a title deed from the Saudi government dated 9/3/1388 A.H. for the year of 1968 in the same area as the Claimant land*\"227; and\n\nii. Mr. Al-Dosari's land was purchased from a *\"Saudi person during year 1968, after the signing of the 1966 Agreement* \"228.\n\nActually, as exposed *supra,* the Kuwaiti Courts entered a final decision recognizing Mr. Al-Dosari's ownership, and indemnifying Mr. Al-Dosari for the expropriated land, even though his ownership deed had been issued by Saudi Arabia after the 1965 Agreement. This case, in conjunction with the lack of explanation on the part of Respondent, is troubling, since the Kuwaiti Courts recognized Mr. Al-Dosari's ownership in apparently similar circumstances as in Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi's case, while the same Kuwaiti Courts, so far, rejected Mr. Faisal Al-Otabi's claims. Mr. Al-Dosari's case, and the absence of any explanations from Respondent in this regard, is an additional reason preventing Respondent from demonstrating, *\"obviously\"* as required by Rule 41(5), that Mr. Faisal Al-Otabi's ownership over the Land would be excluded.\n\nc. As to the owners of the Land over time, Claimant alleged that:\n\n*\"Mr. Faisal Bandar Al-Otaibi and his brother are the heirs of the late Bandar Al-Otaibi (c-2), who had purchased this land from Mr. Abdullah bin Abdelhady Akshan (Saudi nationality) on 2/9/1971 by virtue of a legal deed issued by the judge of Qaisoumia court in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (c-1). [...] Mr. Abdullah bin Abdelhady Akshan (Saudi nationality) was the owner of the land under the title deed issued by King Saud in the year 1900 and the Royal Decree of 1965 in accordance with the content to the judgment of Qaisoumia Court (c-1).[...] Therefore, the sequence of ownership of this land until it reached the plaintiff is true and no doubt of that* \"229.\n\nEven though Claimant alleged, and referred to exhibits it adduced before the Tribunal, the sequence of owners of the Land since 1900, Respondent fails to give any explanations as to this sequence, except that the Land would have been located in 1911 on the Kuwaiti territory what would prevent Claimant from relying on the Saudi deed (Respondent failed to demonstrate, pursuant to the requirements of Rule 41(5),that the Land would have been located in 1911 on the Kuwaiti territory, as explained *supra).* In particular, Respondent fails to give any explanations as to the 2009 document, issued by the *\"State of Kuwait, Ministry of Justice, Legal Authentication Department, Division of Estate* \"230, stating that *\"in accordance with Succession Limitation no. 1572/2004 + Deeds issued by the Sharia Courts no. 412 - 11/7/1391 + draft drawing as per the Deeds no. 412 dated 11/7/1391 A.H., heirs of Bander Marzouq Hazem Al-Otaibi: Faisal Bander Marzouq Hazem Al-Otaibi [...]: 50%; Khalid Bander Marzouq Hazem Al.Otaibi [...]: 50%*\"231, being reminded that the reference \"*no. 412 -11/7/1391\"* matches with the 1971 Saudi deed Claimant relies on. In other words, even though Exhibit C2 is a document issued in 2009 by a Kuwaiti authority stating that, as alleged by Claimant, Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi and his brother (in their capacity as their father's heirs) would be the owners of the Land, Respondent does not explain why this document should be disregarded: There is a significant material inconsistency between Respondent's position and a document issued by its own administration adduced in evidence by Claimant, without any explanations on the part of Respondent. The lack of explanations on the part of Respondent as to this document issued by its administration is an obvious and serious hurdle to the Rule 41(5) objection, what could render Respondent's objection abusive (this issue of abuse of right may remain undecided since Claimant does not raise it). At the very least, the lack of allegations and arguments on the part of Kuwait as to Exhibit C2 prevents Respondent from demonstrating that, *\"obviously\"* as required by Rule 41(5), Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi's ownership over the Land would be excluded.\n\nThe Award of the majority of the Tribunal simply ignores exhibit C2. It ignores a relevant document relied upon and validly adduced in evidence by Claimant232, which is issued by Respondent's own administration and which *prima facie* confirms the validity of the 1971 Saudi deed and the ownership of the Land by Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi and his brother. There is an obvious and significant contradiction between exhibit C2 and the statement in the Award that *\"Claimant has not provided evidence that such title [issued by Saudi Arabia in favor of a Kuwaiti national] has been recognized or registered by any Kuwaiti authority*\"233. Should the Award have not ignored Exhibit C2, it would have come to the conclusion that, by failing to give any explanations as to Exhibit C2, Respondent did not demonstrate that, *\"obviously\"* as required by Rule 41(5), Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi's ownership of the Land would be excluded. The Award not only breaches Rule 41(5): By ignoring a relevant piece of evidence relied upon by Claimant, the Award comes to a conclusion detrimental to Claimant, and thus fails to comply with due process requirements. The majority of the Tribunal failed to comply with the most basic and important duty of arbitral tribunals, *i.e.* to consider and discuss all the relevant exhibits validly adduced in evidence.\n\nd. As to the current owner of the Land, Claimant alleged that *\"no other owner put his hand on it*\"234. Even though Respondent235 considers itself as the owner of the Land, it actually failed to provide any property title. Since Respondent does not prove to be the legitimate owner of the Land, we cannot consider that, *\"obviously\"* as required by Rule 41(5), Claimant\u2019s claims would have to be dismissed in a summary way.\n\nObservations, page 5.\n\nObservations, page 22.\n\nObservations, page 22.\n\nObservations, pages 23 and 24.\n\nExhibit C2\n\nExhibit C2.\n\nObservations, pages 16, 23 and 24.\n\nAward, par. 57.\n\nObservations, page 22.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 84 (lines 8-11).\n\n106.\n\nWith respect to the clauses of the JVA, Claimant alleges that:\n\n- *\"In this agreement, the Claimant (the second party) purchased 5% of the Kuwaiti land owned by the first party for an amount of $20 million [...] to invest in this land to establish such constructions and touristic resorts and to obtain 10% of all profits gained from land and constructions (item 1,3 of the agreement c-5f*\"236; and\n\n- \"*In this agreement, the first party [Mr. Al-Otaibi and his brother] committed to guarantee the transfer of the land and the share of the ownership of the land to the Claimant and to issue a deed from the State of Kuwait in the name of the Claimant [...] (item 5 of the agreement c-5)*\"237.\n\nObservations, pages 4 and 23.\n\nObservations, page 4.\n\n107.\n\nIn its money award claim, Claimant also refers to the following alleged rights: rights on 5% of the Land (and to the necessity to appoint an expert to assess the value of the Land)238, right to part of the profits of the joint venture. Further, Claimant refers to costs for feasibility studies, expert reports and administrative fees allegedly settled239.\n\nObservations, page 24.\n\nObservations, page 25.\n\n108.\n\nWith respect to the Land, the profits and the costs, Claimant described Respondent\u2019s behaviour as follows: *\"my ownership right was not recognized and I was prevented from exercising my investments, from carrying them out*\"240. More specifically, as to the Land, Claimant summarized its position by qualifying Respondent\u2019s behaviour of *\"denial of facilitating to get our ownership deed* \"241.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 113 (lines 22-25), page 114 (line 1).\n\nHearing Transcript, page 111 (lines 7-8).\n\n109.\n\nAs to the JVA, Respondent strangely focused exclusively on the issue of ownership of the Land, and not on the other rights alleged by Claimant. Indeed:\n\n- During the December 14, 2018 hearing, as to the ownership of the land, counsels to Respondent relied once again on Respondent\u2019s one and only legal argument: *\"there cannot be any expropriation of Claimant\u2019s property rights when not even Mr. Al-Otaibi, who allegedly sold part of the land to Claimant, has property rights over the land under Kuwaiti law* \"242.\n\n- However, at the end of the December 14, 2018 hearing only, which was the last opportunity for the parties to present their arguments as to the Application, after a member of the Tribunal asked a question as to the Kuwaiti Real Estate Registration Law243 while none of the Parties had previously mentioned this law, Respondent relied for the first time on an second argument which it had not raised before (to try to demonstrate that Claimant would not be the owner of the Land): under *\"Article 7 of that law [Kuwaiti Real Estate Registration Law,] [...] ownership of real property is effective upon registration of that property* \"244. Respondent however failed to provide to the Tribunal a copy of the considered Kuwaiti Real Estate Registration Law, along with a translation thereof into English. Respondent merely cites one of the decisions rendered by Kuwaiti Courts as to the Land245 which allegedly would provide an exact translation of an exact excerpt of the Real Estate Registration Law. The established rule is that Respondent\u2019s demonstration must be *\"obvious\"* for the purpose of Rule 41(5): One can of course not dismiss Claimant\u2019s case on the basis of one mere article of a Kuwaiti law allegedly reproduced with accuracy in a decision of the Courts of Kuwait, all the more since this decision is contested by Claimant and currently subject to pending appeal proceedings before the Kuwaiti Court of Cassation. The Tribunal should have been able to verify the accuracy of the text of this Kuwaiti law by relying on the full text of this law which the Respondent did not adduce in evidence. Also, since Respondent failed to submit the full text of the law it relied on for the first time at the end of the December 14, 2018 hearing, which was the last opportunity for the Parties to express their views on the Rule 41(5) objection, Claimant was practically prevented from commenting on Respondent\u2019s argument as to the Real Estate Registration Law.\n\n- Further, even if Respondent argues that ownership of 5% of the Land could not have been transferred to Claimant because Mr. Al-Otaibi and his brother would not own the Land (which Respondent fails to demonstrate as exposed *supra,* in particular because exhibit C2 seems *prima facie* to prove that Mr. Al-Otaibi and his brother have been the owner of the Land), and because ownership would not have been registered by Respondent\u2019s own real estate registry pursuant to the Real Estate Registration Law, Respondent did not deny that the JVA would be proper *per se* to grant to Claimant the right to claim the Land and to obtain the registration of the Land. Since Exhibit C2 states *prima facie* (and it is not denied by Respondent) that Mr. Al-Otaibi and his brother have owned the Land, the Tribunal cannot exclude (Respondent does not even allege such exclusion) that the JVA would be proper to provide to Claimant the rights it claims as to the land: the right to claim it and the right to obtain the registration of its alleged ownership.\n\n- The Award holds that the JVA *\"cannot be the basis of a property title*\"246. There is no other arguments as to property rights. In particular, the Award does not state, in its expeditious reasoning, which private international law statute and which substantive law provisions would apply. Moreover, Respondent itself did not raise the argument that the JVA *\"cannot be the basis of a property title\".* This is a breach of Rule 41(5) since a Rule 41(5) objection must be dismissed if *\"Respondent has not satisfied the applicable standard of proof in regard of its [...] objections under Rule 41(5)*\"247: In other words, under Rule 41(5), an arbitral tribunal is barred from substituting the respondent\u2019s deficient Rule 41(5) objections with the tribunal\u2019s own views.\n\nThe same reasoning applies to the issue of the Kuwaiti Real Estate Registration Law: It is a member of the Tribunal who told the Parties about the application of this law and not Respondent, and Respondent failed to provide a full copy of this law with a translation thereof. Consequently, *\"Respondent has not satisfied the applicable standard of proof in regard of its [...] objections under Rule 41(5)* \"248, and thus Respondent\u2019s objection as to the ownership of the Land must be dismissed. Further, the Award fails to mention a part of the provision of the Real Estate Registration Law it refers to. Indeed, Art. 7 par. 3 of this law (as mentioned in the translation of the judgement contested before the Kuwaiti Court of Cassation) provides that \"*the unregistered act shall have on effects but the personal obligations among the concerned persons* \"249, which means, *prima facie* at least, that Claimant would still have all the rights arising under the JVA, including the right to obtain the recognition of its property rights, even though Kuwait would illegally, as argued by Claimant, refuse to register the ownership of the seller (*i.e.* of Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi and his brother). Claimant is *prima facie* likely to have the right to the recognition of its ownership, and its case cannot be dismissed since the lack of property rights is not rendered *\"obvious\"* by Respondent, as required by Rule 41(5). We come incidentally to the conclusion that the Award mistakenly mixes up the right to obtain the recognition of property rights with the ownership itself, to deny any rights to property to Claimant.\n\n- Regarding the additional rights claimed by Claimant: Respondent did not deny, in its Application or during the December 14, 2018 hearing, that the JVA would give Claimant the contractual rights it alleges, in particular with respect to the recognition of ownership of Land, to the share of the real estate project and to the profits (once again, Respondent\u2019s objection as to the alleged expropriated rights focused exclusively on *\"property rights* \"250).\n\n- Consequently, Respondent fails to demonstrate that, \"*obviously*\" as required by Rule 41(5), Claimant would not be the owner of the Land. In addition, Respondent fails to contend, and thus to demonstrate, that Claimant would not hold the other rights it alleges, such as the right to the registration of its alleged ownership, the right to a share of the real estate project and the right to the profits deriving from the JVA, since Respondent opted to remain silent as to these additional rights alleged by Claimant.\n\n- Like Respondent, the Award ignores the allegations of Claimant as to its right to the registration of its alleged ownership, as to the right to a share of the real estate project and as to the right to the profits deriving from the JVA, even though they could *prima facie* be subject to expropriation under Art. 7 BIT. Ignoring these relevant arguments raised by Claimant is an additional breach of due process requirements.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 124 (lines 1-4).\n\nHearing Transcript, page 84 (lines 13-25).\n\nHearing Transcript, page 96 (lines 17-19).\n\nExhibit C4, page 14.\n\nAward, par. 56.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 92.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 92.\n\nExhibit C4, page 14.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 124 (lines 1-4).\n\n110.\n\nRespondent alleged that Claimant would have acknowledged that Mr. Al-Otaibi would not be the owner of the Land: *\"the fact remains, and is fully acknowledged by Claimant, that those [Kuwaiti] courts have ruled against Mr. Al-Otaibi and found that his claim of ownership is unfounded*\"251. Counsel to Respondent repeated, at the end of the December 14, 2018 hearing, that: *\"there cannot be any expropriation of Claimant's property rights when not even Mr. Al-Otaibi who allegedly sold part of the land to Claimant, has property rights over the land under Kuwaiti law, as acknowledged by Claimant in its written briefs and at this hearing*\"252.\n\nApplication, para. 9.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 124 (lines 1-6).\n\n111.\n\nSuch *\"acknowledgement\"* by Claimant, as alleged by Respondent, is inconsistent with the majority of Claimant\u2019s allegations as to this topic which is univocal, for example:\n\n- In the Request for Arbitration: *\"The Claimant - in accordance with this agreement [i.e. the JVA]- purchased and became the owner of 5% of the property of the whole land*\"253.\n\n*-* In Claimant\u2019s Observations: *\"Mr. Faisal Bandar Al-Otaibi and his brother are the heirs of the late Bandar Al-Otaibi (c-2), who had purchased this land from Mr. Abdullah bin Abdelhady Akshan (Saudi nationality) on 2/9/1971 by virtue of a legal deed issued by the judge of Qaisoumia court in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (c-1). [...] Mr. Abdullah bin Abdelhady Akshan (Saudi nationality) was the owner of the land under the title deed issued by King Saud in the year 1900 and the Royal Decree of 1965 in accordance with the content to the judgment of Qaisoumia Court (c-1).[...]*\n\n*And no one claims otherwise. Therefore, the sequence of ownership of this land until it reached the plaintiff is true and no doubt of that* \"254.\n\n*-* During the December 14, 2018 hearing, Claimant alleged:\n\no *\"The Kuwaiti Government does not want to recognise my ownership right and does not want to let me exercise my right to ownership* \"255.\n\n*o \"So we have several aspects: it's a denial of ownership and it's a denial of my right to exercise this ownership*\"256*.*\n\n*o \"the Respondent has the key in his hand whether to ratify this ownership or not. They refrain and preclude me from registering this established ownership*\"257.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, page e.\n\nObservations, pages 23 and 24.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 112 (lines 8-10).\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 112 (lines 14-16).\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 115 (lines 3-4).\n\n112.\n\nThus, Claimant univocally alleges, with respect to the Land, \"*my [its] ownership right* \"258 and its right to *\"registering this established ownership* \"259. At the very least, Respondent fails to demonstrate that, *\"obviously\"* as required by Rule 41(5), Claimant would have admitted that itself and Mr. Al-Otaibi would not be and would not have been the owners of the Land.\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 112 (lines 8-10).\n\nHearing Transcript, p. 115 (lines 3-4).\n\n113.\n\nAlso, *\"given the potentially decisive nature of an Article 41(5) objection [...], it is appropriate that claimant's Request for Arbitration be construed liberally and that, in cases of doubt or uncertainty as to the scope of a claimant's allegation(s), any such doubt or uncertainty should be resolved in favor of the claimant*\"260*.* Consequently, even if Claimant wrote in one instance that \"*the Kuwaiti government prevented the Claimant from taking ownership of the land*\"261, and since the majority of Claimant\u2019s allegations expressly mentions the ownership rights it would hold, one must exclude, for the purpose of the Rule 41(5) Application at least, that Claimant would have acknowledged not to have ownership rights.\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v. Grenada,* par 6.1.3.\n\nObservations, page 4.\n\n114.\n\nFurther, we could seriously wonder how one could reasonably argue that Claimant would have acknowledged a lack of ownership, when we consider the following additional elements:\n\n- Claimant relied262 on Exhibit C2, which is the 2009 document issued by Kuwait's own administration stating, *prima facie* at least, that Mr. Faisal Al-Otaibi and his brother, as their father's heirs, have inherited and have owned the Land;\n\n- The legal proceedings initiated before Kuwaiti courts are currently pending before the Kuwaiti Cassation Court, as admitted expressly by Respondent (and Claimant). Consequently it is simply false to contend, as Respondent alleged it, that it is a *\"fact [...] that those [Kuwaiti] courts have ruled against Mr. Al-Otaibi and found that his claim of ownership is unfounded* \"263.\n\nObservations, pages 16, 23 and 24.\n\nApplication, para. 9.\n\n115.\n\nFinally, for the first time at the end of the December 14, 2018 hearing264 only, Respondent argued that no acts performed by Kuwait would amount to expropriation.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 98 (lines 5-10).\n\n116.\n\nClaimant answered that Respondent's intent to expropriate its Land would have been expressed in Exhibit C12265, which is a 1983 letter from the Kuwaiti Council of Ministers to the Kuwaiti Minister of Public Works reading notably as follows: *\"These [executive and engineering] measures will eventually results the expropriation of all residential and non-residential areas in the old villages of Al-Wafra and Al-Zour [...]*\"266*.*\n\nHearing Transcript, page 110 (lines 6-16).\n\nExhibit C12.\n\n117.\n\nWith respect to the act of expropriation, Claimant stated in its briefs and during the December 14, 2018 hearing, in particular:\n\n- \"*The Claimant and its partner was shocked when the government of the state of Kuwait inform them that it will neither register the land with their name nor compensate them [...] by this act the investment of the claimant in the state of Kuwait was totally destroyed*\"267.\n\n*- \"Illegal refusal to register our land in the State of Kuwait, based on our deed of ownership dated 2/9/1971 and our joint venture agreement dated 15/5/2009 (c-1, c-2 & c-5) [...]*\"268.\n\n- *\"The exact act is their [Kuwait\u2019s] denial of facilitating us to get our ownership deed, which goes under the word, or the statement in Article 7, or any other procedure has similar effect for precluding the investor to proceed with his investment in Kuwaiti territory*\"269.\n\n*- \"My ownership right was not recognized and I was prevented from exercising my investments, from carrying them our* \"270.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, page f.\n\nObservations, page 16.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 111 (lines 7-12).\n\nHearing Transcript, page 113 (lines 24-25), page 114 (line 1).\n\n118.\n\nThus, Claimant contends that its alleged ownership of 5% of the Land is not *\"recognized\"* by the Kuwaiti authorities, and that the act of expropriation would be Kuwaiti's *\"denial\"* to issue an ownership deed.\n\n119.\n\nArticle 7 BIT, as exposed by Claimant271, is rather broad: it provides for indemnification in case of direct expropriation and in case of acts with similar effects as direct expropriation. Also, Respondent itself admitted that any right (and not only real estate ownership) can be subject to expropriation272.\n\nObservations, page 13.\n\nApplication, para. 50.\n\n120.\n\nRespondent does not demonstrate, *\"obviously\"* as required by Rule 41(5), that expropriation shall be excluded when considering Kuwaiti administration's refusal to recognize the alleged ownership of the Land. In particular, Respondent did not submit any case law which would exclude that a State's refusal to recognize ownership of the claimant (directly, or indirectly by refusing to recognize the ownership of the person from which it purchased the real estate property) can never be considered as expropriation under Article 7 BIT. Consequently, it must be considered a novel issue of law, which cannot be dealt with at this stage of the proceedings: \"*it would in principle be inappropriate to consider and resolve novel issues of law in a summary fashion, which would inevitably limit the Parties\u2019 opportunity to be heard and the Tribunal\u2019s opportunity to reflect*\"273.\n\n*PNG v. Papua New Guinea,* para. 94.\n\n121.\n\nWith respect to the other rights and expenses *(\"50% of this joint venture*\"274, *\"10% of all profits*\"275, *\"the visibility study fees, expert inspection reports and marketing expenses* \"276) alleged by Claimant, which considers to have been *\"prevented from exercising my investments, from carrying them out*\"277, Respondent does not demonstrate that, *\"obviously\"* as required by Rule 41(5), these alleged rights cannot have been expropriated. In fact, Respondent did not address these alleged rights at all. Considering that item 3 of the JVA seems *prima facie* to give the rights to a share of the joint venture and of the profits to Claimant, and mentions various costs and expenses incurred, one cannot hold that, *\"obviously\"* as required by Rule 41(5), Claimant\u2019s claims as to the alleged expropriation of these rights would have to be dismissed in a summary fashion.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, page e.\n\nObservations, pages 4 and 23.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, page e.\n\nHearing Transcript, page 113 (lines 24-25), page 114 (line 1).\n\n122.\n\nAs such, the Respondent\u2019s objection is unsuited for a Rule 41(5) Application. It does not involve application of undisputed or indisputable legal rules, but rather involves novel issues of interpretation and analysis. Also, material facts, evidence, legal provisions and case law are missing to consider Claimant\u2019s objection as *\"obviously\"* (as required by Rule 41(5)) founded.\n\n123.\n\nEssentially, all of the arguments raised by the Respondent\u2019s objections involve disputed, and often complex, legal and factual issues which cannot properly be resolved within the expedited Rule 41(5) procedure. Since *\"Respondent has not satisfied the applicable standard of proof in regard of its [...] objections under Rule 41(5)*\"278*,* its Application must be dismissed.\n\n*PNG* v. *Papua New Guinea,* para. 92.\n\n124.\n\nConsequently, I dissent from the result reached by the majority of the Tribunal."}], "Content": "Award on the Respondent's Application under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Frequently Used Abbreviations and Acronyms**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| BIT | Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments Between the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Government of the State of Kuwait |\n| Claimant or Almasryia | Almasryia For Operating & Maintaining Touristic Construction Co., LLC |\n| Ex.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments Between the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Government of the State of Kuwait (the \"**BIT**\"), dated April 17, 2001 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Almasryia For Operating & Maintaining Touristic Construction Co., LLC (\"**Almasryia**\" or the \"**Claimant**\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the State of Kuwait (\"**Kuwait**\" or the \"**Respondent**\"). Almasryia and Kuwait are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Parties.\" The Parties' respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page 2.\n\n4.\n\nThe dispute relates to property rights over a piece of land located north of Al-Khafji city in the Kuwaiti Region of Wafra (the \"**Land**\"). The Claimant entered into a joint venture investment agreement on 15 May 2009 with Mr. Faisal Bandar Al-Otaibi and Bin Samar Contracting Co. to \"develop and construct many touristic hotels, real estate and logistics projects\" on the Land.1 The Claimant allegedly purchased a 5% interest in the Land from Mr. Al-Otaibi in exchange for $20 million dollars in accordance with the joint venture agreement.2 Only after executing the Agreement, Mr. Al-Otaibi unsuccessfully attempted to secure a deed of ownership to the Land through legal proceedings \"inside Kuwait\" before Courts of Kuwait \"in its own name.\"3 According to Almasryia, Kuwait's failure to grant Mr. Al-Otaibi a deed of ownership for the Land destroyed its joint venture investment in violation of Kuwait's obligations under Articles 6 and 7 of the BIT. During the hearing, Claimant withdrew the claim under Article 6 and affirmed that it only claimed under Article 7.4\n\nRequest for Arbitration, p. e.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nRequest for Arbitration, p. f, *see also* Statement of Claimant, p. 4.\n\nTr. H., p. 80:10-19.\n\n5.\n\nThe merits of such allegations are not the subject of this decision. This decision concerns a preliminary matter, namely Kuwait's application (the \"**Preliminary Objections**\") -submitted on 3 September 2018 - for dismissal of all of Almasryia's claims on the grounds that they are \"manifestly without legal merit,\" pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"**Arbitration Rules**\").\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n6.\n\nOn 24 October 2017, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration of the same date from Almasryia (the \"**Request for Arbitration**\"), as supplemented by letters of 5 December 2017, 5 January 2018, and 27 January 2018.\n\n7.\n\nOn 14 February 2018, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to agree on the number of arbitrators and the method of their appointment pursuant to Rule 7(c) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, and to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n8.\n\nOn 20 May 2018, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal consist of three arbitrators, and that each Party appoint one arbitrator, with the President of the Tribunal to be appointed by agreement of the Parties, pursuant to Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n9.\n\nBy letters of 28 May 2018, the Claimants appointed Mr. Pascal D\u00e9vaud, a national of Switzerland, and the Respondent appointed Prof. Dr. Rolf Knieper, a national of Germany.\n\n10.\n\nOn 10 July 2018, having failed to agree on the presiding arbitrator, ICSID communicated to the parties that the President would be appointed by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council (the \"**Chairman**\") pursuant to Articles 38 and 40(1) of the ICSID Convention. Following consultations with the Parties, the Chairman appointed Prof. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez, a national of Mexico, in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n11.\n\nOn 2 August 2018, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Secretary-General of ICSID notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Catherine Kettlewell, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n12.\n\nOn 3 September 2018, the Respondent filed its Preliminary Objections pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n13.\n\nOn 21 September 2018, the Tribunal held a first session by telephone conference in accordance with Arbitration Rule 13(1).\n\n14.\n\nOn 30 September 2018, the Claimant filed observations on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(5).\n\n15.\n\nOn 22 October 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 concerning procedural matters.\n\n16.\n\nOn 2 November 2018, the Tribunal requested the Claimant to provide an update on the status to obtain a visa to travel for the hearing.\n\n17.\n\nOn 9 November 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confer and propose an agenda and timetable for the upcoming hearing on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection. On 26 November 2018, the Respondent submitted the exchanges of the Parties regarding this matter and provided its proposal and comments. On 30 November 2018, the Tribunal issued its decision on the agenda and timetable for the hearing. The Tribunal also indicated that the Claimant\u2019s request for translation English/Arabic was granted.\n\n18.\n\nA hearing on the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections was held at the World Bank facilities in Paris on 14 December 2018 (the \"**Hearing**\"). The following persons were present at the Hearing:\n\n*Tribunal* :  \nProfessor Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez President  \nMr. Pascal D\u00e9vaud Arbitrator  \nProfessor Dr. Rolf Knieper Arbitrator\n\n*ICSID Secretariat* :  \nMs. Catherine Kettlewell Secretary of the Tribunal\n\n*For the Claimant* :  \nDr. Ezzat Ahmad Mohammed Youssef  \nDr. Mohamed Tanweer Mohamed El-Rafie\n\n*For the Respondent* :  \nMr. Charles L. O. Buderi Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP  \nMs. Gabriela \u00c1lvarez \u00c1vila Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP  \nMs. Luciana Ricart Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP  \nMs. Mariana G\u00f3mez Vall\u00edn Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle LLP  \nMr. Saud Alqemlas Legal Advice and Legislation Department \u2013 Council of Ministers, State of Kuwait  \nMs. Noura Al Roudan Legal Advice and Legislation Department \u2013 Council of Ministers, State of Kuwait  \nMs. Dhuha Alyaseen Legal Advice and Legislation Department \u2013 Council of Ministers, State of Kuwait  \nMs. Dhuha Al-Sayer Legal Advice and Legislation Department \u2013 Council of Ministers, State of Kuwait  \nMr. Talal Alzimami Legal Advice and Legislation Department \u2013 Council of Ministers, State of Kuwait\n\n*Court Reporter* :  \nMs. Anne-Marie Stallard The Court Reporter Ltd.\n\n*Interpreters* :  \nMs. Maha El-Metwally English-Arabic interpreter  \nMs. Michele Antaki English-Arabic interpreter\n\n19.\n\nOn 17 December 2018, the Tribunal referred to section 21.3 of Procedural Order No. 1 and gave instructions to the Parties regarding corrections to the transcript. Pursuant to the Tribunal's instruction, any transcript corrections agreed by the Parties or adopted by the Tribunal would be entered by the court reporter. On the same date, the Centre informed the Parties that the audio recording of the Hearing was available in the file sharing platform created for this case.\n\n20.\n\nOn 7 January 2019, the Respondent submitted its proposed corrections to the transcript and indicated that it had not received comments from the Claimant. On 9 January 2019, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to briefly comment on the Respondent\u2019s proposed revisions. On the same date, the Claimant indicated that it had no comments. On 10 January 2019, the court reporter provided the revised transcripts to the Parties and the Tribunal.\n\n21.\n\nOn 17 June 2019, the Tribunal invited the parties to provide their submission on costs for this phase of the proceeding by 1 July 2019. On 1 July 2019, being a simultaneous submission, the Secretary of the Tribunal received Respondent\u2019s submission on costs. On 2 July 2019 and not having received Claimant\u2019s submission on costs, the Tribunal granted Claimant an extension until 9 July 2019. The Tribunal instructed the Secretary of the Tribunal not to forward Respondent\u2019s submission on costs until she received both submissions pursuant to section 12.2 of Procedural Order No. 1. The Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Tribunal that she had not received Claimant\u2019s submission on costs by the extended deadline. Thereafter, the Tribunal instructed the Secretary to acknowledge receipt of Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs, to copy Claimant\u2019s counsel and to forward it to the Tribunal.\n\n22.\n\nThe proceeding was closed on 1 November 2019.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nThis procedure concerns the Preliminary Objection submitted by the Respondent under Arbitration Rule 41(5) which provides the following:\n\n\"Unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections, a party may, *no later than 30 days* after the constitution of the Tribunal, and *in any event before the first session of the Tribunal,* file an objection that a claim is *manifestly without legal merit.* The party shall specify as precisely as possible the basis for the objection. The Tribunal, after giving the parties the opportunity to present their observations on the objection, shall, at its first session or promptly thereafter, notify the parties of its decision on the objection. The decision of the Tribunal shall be without prejudice to the right of a party to file an objection pursuant to paragraph (1) or to object, in the course of the proceeding, that a claim lacks legal merit.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n24.\n\nAccording to this rule, unless the parties have agreed to another expedited procedure, objections on whether a claim is \"manifestly without legal merit\" are allowed provided that they are filed \"no later than 30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal\" and in any event \"before the first session of the Tribunal.\" It is undisputed that the Parties have not agreed to another expedited procedure for making preliminary objections. However, compliance with the time limit of 30 days was questioned by the Claimant at the hearing.5 The Tribunal will address first this allegation and then proceed with its analysis under the provision at issue.\n\nTr. H., p. 55:18-25, 56:1-2.\n\n**A. Whether the Preliminary Objections Filed by the Respondent were Timely**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nRegulation 29 of ICSID's Administrative and Financial Regulations establishes that:\n\n\"(1) *All time limits,* specified in the Convention *or the Rules* or fixed by a Commission, Tribunal, Committee or the Secretary-General, *shall be computed from the date* on which the limit is announced in the presence of the parties or their representatives or *on which the Secretary-General dispatches the pertinent notification* or instrument (which date shall be marked on it). *The day of such announcement or dispatch shall be excluded from the calculation.*\n\n(2) *A time limit shall be satisfied if a notification* or instrument dispatched by a party *is delivered* at the seat of the Centre, or to the Secretary of the competent Commission, Tribunal or Committee that is meeting away from the seat of the Centre, *before the close of business on the indicated date or, if that day is a Saturday, a Sunday, a public holiday* observed at the place of delivery or a day on which for any reason regular mail delivery is restricted at the place of delivery, then before the close of *business on the next subsequent day on which regular mail service is available*.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n26.\n\nThe application containing the Respondent's Preliminary Objections filed by the Respondent was submitted on 3 September 2018. In light of this provision, the Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant that this application is \"on its face... non-compliant.\" The Secretary-General notified the Parties of the Tribunal's constitution on 2 August 2018. According to this Regulation 29, the day of dispatch shall be excluded from calculation. Therefore, the Preliminary Objections were filed within the 30-day period and were thus timely in accordance with Arbitration Rule 41(5).6\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections were presented earlier since the ICSID Secretariat was closed on Monday, 3 September in observance of Labor Day.

The Legal Standard Under Rule 41(5)**\n------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection requires us to examine Arbitration Rule 41(5) in accordance with the general rule of interpretation enshrined in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\"). We begin our analysis with the said provision.\n\n28.\n\nRule 41(5) provides in its relevant part that: \"a party may... file an objection that a claim is *manifestly without legal merit.\"* (emphasis added) At the outset, the Tribunal observes that the word \"manifestly\" qualifies the term \"without legal merit.\" \"Manifestly\" as an adjective means7: \"readily perceived by the senses and especially by the sense of sight\" as well as \"easily understood or recognized by the mind: obvious.\"8 The word \"merit\" has several meanings: \"obsolete: reward or punishment due; the qualities or actions that constitute the basis of one's deserts; a praiseworthy quality: virtue; character or conduct deserving reward, honor, or esteem; spiritual credit held to be earned by performance of righteous acts and to ensure future benefits; the substance of a legal case apart from matters of jurisdiction, procedure, or form; individual significance or justification.\"9 On the other hand, \"legal\" has also several definitions: \"of or relating to law; deriving authority from or founded on law: *de jure;* having a formal status derived from law often without a basis in actual fact: titular; established by law especially: statutory; conforming to or permitted by law or established rules; recognized or made effective by a court of law as distinguished from a court of equity; of, relating to, or having the characteristics of the profession of law or of one of its members; created by the constructions of the law.\"10\n\nIn the context of the WTO, the Appellate Body has cautioned that dictionary definitions may be a start in the process of interpretation, however, an interpretation according to the VCLT is a *holistic exercise:* \"The Appellate Body has previously held that, while a panel may start with the dictionary definitions of the terms to be interpreted, in the process of discerning the ordinary meaning, dictionaries alone are not necessarily capable of resolving complex questions of interpretation because they typically catalogue all meanings of words. Dictionaries are important guides to, but not dispositive of, the meaning of words appearing in treaties... Under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, the \"ordinary meaning\" of treaty terms may be ascertained only in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the treaty.\" WTO, Appellate Body Report, *China - Publications and Audiovisual Products,* para. 348 (fns omitted).\n\n\"Manifestly\" Merriam-Webster.com. 2019. https://www.merriam-webster.com.

(29 March 2019).\n\n29.\n\nThe tribunal in *Trans-Global Petroleum v. Jordan* examined the ordinary dictionary meaning of \"manifestly\" as well as the context provided by other provisions of the ICSID Convention and determined that: \"...the ordinary meaning of the word [manifestly] requires the respondent to establish its objection *clearly and obviously, with relative ease and despatch\"* In light of this, it considered that the standard under Rule 41(5) was \"set high\" and that although \"[the] exercise may not always be simple... [and] thus be complicated; [...] *it should never be difficult\"* (emphasis added)11\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc. v. Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/25, Tribunal\u2019s Decision on the Respondent\u2019s Objection under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, 12 May 2008 (hereinafter *TransGlobal Petroleum v. Jordan)* (Ex. RL-6), para. 88. In the same sense, para. 105 referring to a test of \"clarity, certainty and obviousness.\" See also *Brandes Investment Partners, LP v.

Croatia),* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/32, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Application under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), 2 December 2014 (Ex. RL-11), paras. 44 and 45, the tribunal agreed with the standard drawn in *Trans-Global Petroleum v. Jordan,* although it distinguished between a claim \"by an investor that can properly be rejected out of hand\" and \"one which requires more elaborate argument for its eventual disposition\", indicating that such distinction had to be maintained.\n\n30.\n\nAs to the phrase \"without legal merit\" it noted the significance of the adjective \"legal\" and considered that it \"is clearly used in contradistinction to 'factual\u2019\", which would indicate that a tribunal is not concerned \"*per se* with the factual merits.\"12 The phrase \"legal merit\" was considered in *Brandes v. Venezuela* as covering \"all objections to the effect that the proceedings should be discontinued at an early stage because, for whatever reason, the claim can manifestly not be granted by the Tribunal.\"13\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum v. Jordan* (Ex. RL-6), paras. 93 and 97. The Tribunal takes note that during the hearing, the Claimant placed an emphasis on the legal as opposed to the factual nature of an objection under this provision: \"So the drafter needs to convey us or to transfer to us a very important message, that please, *abide to the word \"legal.*\" *It's not a matter of fact. It's not a matter of discussing facts here.* It\u2019s not a matter of interpretation or analysis to be concluded by the Tribunal whether to go to this side, interpreting this discussion, for the Claimant or for the Respondent. No basis or no rules for any interpretation or analysis or any disputable facts in this stage of the case. Accordingly, it is demonstrated that *the application of Rule 41(5) does not include any objections that might raise a challenge based on the factual flaws of a case.'\"* (emphasis added) Tr. H., p. 66:3-14.\n\n*Brandes v. Venezuela,* (Ex. RL-7), para. 55.\n\n31.\n\nIn this regard, investment tribunals have held that Rule 41(5) concerns \"a legal impediment to a claim\" (not a factual one) which can go to jurisdiction or the merits of the dispute.14 Nonetheless, the tribunal in *Trans-Global Petroleum v. Jordan* recognized that \"it is rarely possible to assess the legal merits of any claim without also examining the factual premise upon which that claim is advanced.\"15 In that case the tribunal expressed its view that:\n\n\"[T]he tribunal need not accept at face value any factual allegation which the tribunal regards as (manifestly) incredible, frivolous, vexatious or inaccurate or made in bad faith; nor... accept a legal submission dressed up as a factual allegation. The Tribunal does not accept, however, that a tribunal should otherwise weigh the credibility or plausibility of a disputed factual allegation.\"16\n\n*Rachel S. Grynberg, Stephen M. Grynberg, Miriam Z. Grynberg, and RSM Production Corporation v. Grenada,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010 (Ex. RL-5), paras. 4.2.1 and 6.1.1. \"[T]he Parties agree that Rule 41(5) pertains only to legal defects, including those involving either jurisdiction or the merits, but not to factual defects. This does not mean that factual premises of claims may not be acknowledged in order to understand the essence of the legal claim asserted\", *Eskosol S.p.A. in liquidazione v. Italian Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Decision on Respondent\u2019s Application under Rule 41(5), 20 March 2017 (hereinafter *Eskosol v. Italy)* (Ex. RL-8), para. 35. See also *Brandes v. Venezuela,* (Ex. RL-7), paras. 55 and 59.\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum v. Jordan,* (Ex. RL-6), para. 97.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 105.\n\n32.\n\nThe tribunal in *Eskosol v. Italy* also recognized the \"level of sophistication\" of investment proceedings while emphasizing that \"the Rule 41(5) procedure is not intended, nor should it be used, as the mechanism to address complicated, difficult or unsettled issues of law.\"17 The Tribunal agrees with the interpretations provided by the aforementioned tribunals and also shares the view expressed in *Emmis v. Hungary*, that a tribunal:\n\n\"*must ordinarily presume the facts* which found the claim on the merits *as alleged by the claimant* to be true (*unless they are plainly without any foundation).* In the application of those presumed facts to the legal question of its jurisdiction, the tribunal must then decide whether, *as matter of law, those facts fall within or outside the scope of the consent to arbitrate.* Where the objection is taken under the procedure provided in Rule 41(5), it will decide to grant the objection if one or more of the claims *fall clearly outside the scope of its jurisdiction* so that, for the purpose of these proceedings, the claim must be treated as being 'manifestly without legal merit'.\"18 (emphasis added)\n\n*Eskosol v. Italy* (Ex. RL-8), para. 41.\n\n*Emmis International Holding, B.V., Emmis Radio Operating, B.V. and Mem Magyar Electronic Media Kereskedelmi \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 Kft. v.

RL-12), para. 26.\n\n33.\n\nIn view of the above, our task will be to determine whether taking the facts as a given, unless they are plainly without foundation, the claims are such that they \"manifestly\" *(i.e.* clearly and obviously) lack legal merit.\n\n**C. Whether Non-Compliance with Article 10(2) of the BIT Renders the Claim Manifestly Without Legal Merit**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n34.\n\nThe Respondent argues that one of the grounds in which the claims manifestly lacks legal merit is \"jurisdictional in nature.\" In the Respondent\u2019s opinion, Article 10(2) of the BIT conditions Kuwait\u2019s consent to the lapse of a six-month negotiation period from the date on which an investor notifies Kuwait of a dispute under the BIT. According to the Respondent, the Claimant did not comply with the mandatory requirement of giving notice to Kuwait under Article 10(2) of the BIT, nor did it comply with the mandatory requirement of waiting six months after giving such notice before initiating this arbitration.19\n\nRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, paras. 52, 53 and 58.\n\n35.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, pursuant to an agreement, it ordered its partner to \"follow all legal steps of ICSID rules for arbitration and to implement article 10(2) and 10(3)... to convince the State of Kuwait to back down from its illegal refusal... and to inform the state of Kuwait by our explicit consent to solve this disputes by arbitration in accordance with ICSID rules and the... convention.\"20\n\nStatement of Claimant, p. 16.\n\n36.\n\nArticle 10 of the BIT establishes the following:\n\n\"1 - Disputes which arise between a Contracting State and an investor belonging to the other Contracting State, in relation to an investment in the territory of the first State which returns to the latter, shall be settled, as far as is possible, by amicable means.\n\n2- *If that dispute cannot be settled* within *six months* of the date on which either of the two parties to the dispute *requested an amicable settlement* by *notifying the other party in writing,* then the dispute shall be referred for resolution by one of the following means, to be chosen by the investor who is a party to the dispute.21 (Emphasis added)\n\nAgreement for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments Between the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt and the Government of the State of Kuwait, Articles 1 and 2 (Ex. R-03).\n\n37.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the first paragraph of Article 10 uses the language \"shall be settled\" when referring to amicable means. While such language could normally indicate an obligation, the phrase \"as far as possible\" presupposes that there will be cases where settlement under those conditions will not be achieved and resort to paragraph 2 will have to be made. All together the phrase \"shall be settled, as far as is possible, by amicable means\" would seem to indicate an obligation of the parties to try to settle the dispute through amicable means as a preferred method for dispute resolution while recognizing that this scenario may not always be possible.\n\n38.\n\nOn the other hand, paragraph 2 also incorporates mandatory language (\"*shall be referred for resolution\")* and in addition to that, it establishes a period of six months from the date in which either of the two parties *\"requested* an amicable settlement *by* notifying the other party in writing.\" The Tribunal observes that the language used is *conditional:* the provision allows the referral of the dispute for resolution \"if\" the dispute is not solved within six-months starting from a specific action (\"*the request of an amicable settlement\"*) through *written notification.* The language of this provision plainly indicates that neither the written notification nor the six-month time-period is optional; rather, these steps are to be complied with before an arbitration may be initiated.\n\n39.\n\nThe purpose of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 10 is to allow the Parties in a dispute to try to reach a solution of the matter before resorting to arbitration. It seeks to prevent a dispute by giving advance notice to a State so that, if possible, a positive solution to the dispute may be achieved. This requirement is an integral part of the State's consent rather that a negligible formality. However, although the treaty does not force the parties to reach an amicable settlement, the provision does condition resort to arbitration to the fulfillment of certain requirements, among them a notification to the other party in writing. In this Tribunal's view compliance with the terms of Article 10 should be clear and unequivocal.\n\n40.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with the opinion expressed by other investment tribunals to the extent that:\n\n\"The six-month waiting period requirement... is designed precisely to provide the State with an opportunity to redress the dispute before the investor decides to submit the dispute to arbitration.... by imposing upon investors an *obligation to voice their disagreement* at least six months prior to the submission of an investment dispute to arbitration, the Treaty *effectively accords host States the right to be informed about the dispute* at least six months before it is submitted to arbitration. The purpose of this right is to grant the host State an opportunity to redress the problem before the investor submits the dispute to arbitration... Claimant has deprived the host State of that opportunity. That suffices to defeat jurisdiction.\"22\n\n\"[It] constitutes a *fundamental requirement...* It is not an *inconsequential procedural* requirement but rather a *key component of the legal framework* established in the BIT and in many other similar treaties... It amounts to... an *essential mechanism*... which *compels the parties to make a genuine effort to engage in good faith negotiations before resorting to arbitration.* \"23\n\n\"The *explicit requirements* that the parties must seek to engage in consultations and negotiations... and that there be a... waiting period... are accepted by the Tribunal as pre-conditions to submitting the dispute to arbitration... *compliance is an essential element of* Turkey's *prospective consent* to qualify its sovereignty to permit unknown future investors of the other contracting State to claim relief under the terms of the BIT against it in an international forum.\"24 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Burlington Resources INC. v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No ARB/08/5, Decision on jurisdiction, 2 June 2010 (Ex. RL-29), paras. 312 and 315.\n\n*Murphy Exploration and Production Company International v. Republic of Ecuador,* ICSID Case No. ARB/08/4, Award on Jurisdiction, 15 December 2010 (Ex. RL-30), paras. 149, 151 and 154. In addition, \"[a] failure to comply with that requirement would result in a determination of lack of jurisdiction\", *Enron Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. The Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 January 2004 (Ex. RL-27), para. 88. In the same vein, see: *Kili\u00e7 \u012cn\u015faat \u012cthalat \u012chracat Sanayi Ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v. Turkmenistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/1, Award, 2 July 2013 (Ex.

RL-31), paras. 71 and 72.\n\n41.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimant argued that the waiting period \"[was] a mere procedure and directly period to attempt alternative dispute resolution.\"25 To support its argument, the Claimant relied on *SGS v. Pakistan.* In that case, the provision at issue indicated that consultations had to take place between a State and the investor. If such consultations did not result in a solution within 12 months, the dispute would be submitted to arbitration.26 The tribunal considered such requirement to be directory and procedural in nature rather than jurisdictional and mandatory:\n\n\"Tribunals have generally tended to treat consultation periods as directory and procedural rather than as mandatory and jurisdictional in nature. Compliance with such a requirement is, accordingly, not seen as amounting to a condition precedent for the vesting of jurisdiction... It should also be noted that in the prolonged period of time from termination of the PSI Agreement by Pakistan to the submission of SGS's written consent under the BIT, there was *little indication of any inclination on the part of either party to enter into negotiations or consultations in respect of the unfolding dispute.* Finally, it does not appear consistent with the need for *orderly and cost-effective procedure* to halt this arbitration at this juncture and require the Claimant first to consult with the Respondent before re-submitting the Claimant\u2019s BIT claims to this Tribunal.\"27 (Emphasis added)\n\nTr. H., p. 77:6-8.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003, para. 183.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 184.\n\n42.\n\nIn the view of that tribunal, such procedural requirement could, for the sake of efficiency, be waived if there was no indication that consultations would be fruitful. The Claimant also quoted *Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania.*28 In that case, the tribunal took the same view and adopted a \"useful purpose\" approach.\n\n\"In the Arbitral Tribunal\u2019s view, however, properly construed, this six-month period is procedural and directory in nature, rather than jurisdictional and mandatory. Its underlying purpose is to facilitate opportunities for amicable settlement. Its purpose is not to impede or obstruct arbitration proceedings, *where such settlement is not possible.* Non-compliance with the six-month period, therefore, does not preclude this Arbitral Tribunal from proceeding. If it did so, the provision would have curious effects, including: - preventing the prosecution of a claim, and forcing the claimant to do nothing until six months have elapsed, *even where further negotiations are obviously futile, or settlement obviously impossible for any reason* ; - forcing the claimant to recommence an arbitration started too soon, even if the six-month period has elapsed by the time the Arbitral Tribunal considers the matter.. In this case, the course of events amply demonstrated that any further delay on BGT\u2019s part would not have served any useful purpose. By the time the Request for Arbitration was filed, *a long process of negotiation and renegotiation had already failed*, and the Republic\u2019s position was entrenched - in particular by virtue of Minister Lowassa\u2019s public statement of 13 May 2005, and the steps that had since been taken to deport City Water personnel, and take over its operations. It was therefore entirely reasonable for BGT to proceed to arbitration, rather than seeking to resolve the dispute through \"local remedies or otherwise\".\"29 (Emphasis added)\n\nTr. H., p. 77:22-25.\n\n*Biwater Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania,* ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award, 24 July 2008, paras. 343-347. The tribunal in *Biwater v. Tanzania* also recalled the reasoning in *CMS v. Argentina* on whether the State had suffered or would suffer prejudice. The Claimant has also made reference to *Ronald S. Lauder v. The Czech Republic.* In that case, the tribunal took the view that the six-month waiting period was not a jurisdictional provision and its purpose was \"to allow the parties to engage in good-faith negotiations before initiating arbitration.\" The tribunal took into account that there was no evidence that the Respondent would have accepted to enter into negotiations and that another interpretation would amount in that case to an \"unnecessary, overly formalistic approach.\" *Ronald S. Lauder v. The Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Final Award, 3 September 2001, paras. 181-190.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal respectfully disagrees with the views expressed in the cases referred to by the Claimant in as much as they considered certain consultation requirements procedural to be directory and procedural in nature. Moreover, in this Tribunal\u2019s opinion there are certain features that differentiate those cases from this one, such as: the difference in the treaty text at issue, the fact that in light of the circumstances and evidence presented those tribunals took into account the usefulness of consultations, as well as the fact that in two of those cases either a notification had been made or a process of consultations had even taken place.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to examine whether it is manifest that the Claimant failed to comply with the requirement in Article 10(2) of the BIT, in light of the facts as put forward, and thus whether a legal impediment to the claims manifestly exists. The Claimant contends that this requirement was fulfilled. Thus, its legal premise is that, by virtue of the BIT it is entitled to have recourse to arbitration and the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections in that regard should be dismissed.30 The Tribunal observes, however, that a notification from the Claimant to the State of Kuwait pursuant to the BIT requesting for an amicable solution to a dispute has not been submitted to the State of Kuwait.\n\nStatement of Claimant, pages 16 and 17. Tr. H., p. 69:1-23.\n\n45.\n\nSpecifically, the Claimant argues that it complied with Article 10(2) of the BIT, relying on the documents contained in exhibits C-8 and C-9. Exhibit C-8 contains a series of communications from agencies in Kuwait referencing Mr. Al-Otaibi and the heirs of another Kuwaiti national, but none of those communications identify the Claimant or the BIT at issue. Exhibit C-9 contains a letter that identifies the Claimant and the BIT is a communication solely from the Claimant to a Kuwaiti national mentioned in the other exhibits. However, this letter appears to be merely a between private parties to a contract whereby one party (the Claimant) request the other (a Kuwaiti national mentioned in other exhibits) to comply with its contractual obligations. The letter is not addressed to the State of Kuwait, nor does it mention any specific provision of the BIT, a request for an amicable solution of the matter or even a dispute under the BIT. Consequently, the Tribunal considers that it is obvious that this does not constitutes a notification from the Claimant to Kuwait requesting an amicable settlement of the dispute under Article 10(2) of the BIT.\n\n46.\n\nIn reference to one of the letters, the Claimant stated at the hearing: \"I'm the one meant by the word 'partners'. Nobody else proclaiming that. Yes, the Respondent says that there is -- the name of the Claimant is not mentioned here, but nobody else is proclaiming that he is the partner. I am the partner meant by this word here.\"31 Additionally, evidence as to official legal representation from Claimant by the Kuwaiti national has not been presented to this Tribunal. The Tribunal further notes that the Joint Venture Agreement referenced does not provide for representation since it indicates that procedures in Kuwait should be made in the name of the Kuwaiti national and not in the name of the Claimant.\n\nTr. H., pp. 69:24-25 and 70:1-4.\n\n47.\n\nIn examining whether the claims manifestly lacks legal merit. We have taken the facts as pleaded by the Claimant. However, although the Claimant argues that it complied with the six-month waiting period and the notification requirement through a series of letters, none of these letters remotely support the Claimant's position. This is manifest, clear and obvious just from simply looking at the text of the letters. While we must take the factual allegations at face value, we do not consider this is the case when the evidence presented flatly and unequivocally contradicts the legal premise advanced.\n\n48.\n\nIn light of the above, the Tribunal considers that it is manifest that the Claimant did not request an amicable settlement of the dispute through a written notification to the Respondent in accordance with Article 10(2) of the BIT. The Tribunal thus considers that there is a legal impediment which goes to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n\n**D. Whether the Claim Under Article 7 of the BIT is Manifestly Without Legal Merit**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim is manifestly without legal merit since it \"ignores the basic principle that liability for expropriation under international law is dependent on the existence and nature of the rights allegedly expropriated\" and that \"the existence and nature of such rights are defined by the domestic law of the State which has allegedly taken the expropriatory action.\"32 In the Respondent\u2019s view, Mr. Al-Otaibi, the Kuwaiti national who sold \"an interest in the Land, [did] not possess any such property rights\", therefore, \"he was quite obviously not able to transfer any such rights to Claimant\" which, in turn, \"lacks any legal grounds for asserting a claim against Respondent that it has expropriated such (non-existent) rights.\"33\n\nRespondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, para. 50.\n\n*Ibid,* para. 51.\n\n50.\n\nThe Claimant argues in its Request for Arbitration that it entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Mr. Al-Otaibi, a Kuwaiti national, by virtue of which it \"purchased and became the owner of 5% of the property of the whole land, in addition to his shares of 50% of this joint venture agreement.\"34 In its Statement of Claim it indicates that:\n\n\"...the claimant (the second party) *purchased 5% of the Kuwaiti land* owned by the first party for an amount of $20 million in order to establish with the first and third party residential and touristic communities and to invest in this land to establish such constructions and touristic resorts and to obtain *10% of all profits* gained from land and constructions... the Kuwaiti government *prevented the claimant from taking ownership of the land, and seized and expropriated it for public benefit* and *did not* hand over or *compensate* the claimant for the value of its share.\"35 (Emphasis added).\n\nRequest for Arbitration, p. \"e\".\n\nStatement of Claimant, p. 4.\n\n51.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the Respondent owes \"compensation for the land which [it] expropriated from the Claimant.\"36\n\n*Ibid,* p. 13. Although in the Request for Arbitration the Claimant argued breaches to Articles 6 and 7 of the BIT in its Request for Arbitration, upon a question from the Tribunal, it clarified that only Article 7 is being challenged. Tr. H., p. 80:10-19.\n\n52.\n\nIn its relevant part, Article 7 of the BIT provides the following:\n\n\"1 - (a) Investments made by investors belonging to either of the two Contracting States in the territory of the other Contracting State shall not be subject to nationalisation, expropriation, or confiscation, nor shall they be subject, directly or indirectly, to measures whose effect is equivalent to nationalisation, expropriation, or confiscation (referred to collectively hereinafter as \"expropriation\") by the other Contracting State, except for a public purpose relating to a national interest of that Contracting State, and then in return for compensation that is immediate, sufficient and effective, and on the condition that those measures are taken on a non-discriminatory basis, and in accordance with legal procedures in general usage.\n\n2- \"Expropriation\" also includes cases when a Contracting State expropriates the assets of a company or enterprise which was set up or founded in accordance with the laws in force in its territory, in which an investor belonging to the other Contracting State has a majority or important share, through owning stocks, shares, bonds, rights, or other interests.\n\n3- The term \"expropriation\" also includes any interference or regulatory procedures carried out by a Contracting State such as incorporating or restricting the investment, or the forced sale of all or part of the investment, or any other similar procedures having the same effect of seizing the property or expropriating it, and arising from which procedures, the investor is in actuality dispossessed of his property, or his majority or substantial interest in his investment, or suffers loss or damage to the economic value of the investment.\"\n\n53.\n\nAs an essential starting point, investment tribunals have recognized the existence of rights under the relevant domestic law within the context of expropriation claims, such as in *Emmis v. Hungary:*\n\n\"Claimants *must have held a property right* of which they have been deprived. This follows from the ordinary meaning of the term. The *Oxford English Dictionary* defines 'expropriate\u2019 as '(of the state or an authority) take (property) from its owner for public use or benefit\u2019/'dispossess (someone) of property\u2019\"... The Tribunal in *Waste Management II* made the same point when it held that the object of expropriation is the *property of the claimant*... In order to determine whether an investor/claimant holds property or assets capable of constituting an investment *it is necessary in the first place to refer to host State law*. *Public international law does not create property rights.* Rather, *it accords certain protections to property rights created according to municipal law.\"*37 (Emphasis added)\n\n*Emmis v. Hungary,* para. 162 (Ex. RL-24). That tribunal also held that: \"it is important to emphasise that the protection from expropriation in relation to rights conferred under contract still requires identification of a property interest or asset held by the claimant... Moreover, such an interpretation also accords with the separate and distinct function of the protection against expropriation as compared to the other protections included within the framework of the wider investment treaty.\" *See* paras. 165 and 167.\n\n54.\n\nThe tribunal in *EnCana v. Ecuador* also expressed that: \"for there to have been an expropriation of an investment or return (in a situation involving legal rights or claims as distinct from the seizure of physical assets) the rights affected must exist under the law which creates them, in this case, the law of Ecuador.\"38 Likewise, in *Quiborax v. Bolivia,* the tribunal agreed that: \"in order for a right to be expropriated, it must first exist under the relevant domestic law (in this case, Bolivian law).\"39\n\n*EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador,* LCIA Case No. UN3481 (UNCITRAL), Award, 3 February 2006, (Ex. RL-25), para. 184.\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kapl\u00fan v.

RL-26), para. 39.\n\n55.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent \"prevented [it] from taking ownership of the land\" and that it \"expropriated its land and did not enable it to register its ownership in government departments.\"40 The Claimant alleges two bases for its ownership rights: a deed issued by Saudi Arabia in favor of Mr. Al-Otaibi, a Kuwaiti national [not the Claimant] and a private joint venture agreement between Mr. Al-Otaibi and the Claimant whereby Mr. Al-Otaibi agrees to sell the Land once such Land is recognized by Kuwaiti authorities.41\n\nStatement of Claimant, p.11.\n\nAt the hearing, the Claimant was asked by the Tribunal whether it \"had ever had any title to property\" and \"what [was] the title of Claimant?\", to which the Claimant responded \"yes... [t]he title agreement is owning 5% of the disputed land.\" Tr. H., p. 116:6-13.\n\n56.\n\nWith regard to the private joint venture agreement, the Tribunal considers that a promise between two private parties contained in a private instrument, which has not been sanctioned or recognized by the host state, cannot be the basis of a property title.\n\n57.\n\nIn addition, regarding the deed, the Claimant has not argued or provided any evidence that such title [issued by Saudi Arabia in favor of a Kuwaiti national], has been recognized or registered by any Kuwaiti authority. Rather, it has asserted that the Respondent has \"prevented the claimant from taking ownership of the land.\"42 In that regard, Article 7 of the Real-estate Registration Law, which was discussed during the hearing.43 This provision provides the following:\n\n\"The non-registration shall result in that the said rights shall not be created, transferred, changed or cancelled among the concerned persons or others.\"44\n\nStatement of Claimant, page 4.\n\nAt the hearing, the Respondent consulted with Kuwaiti counsel and indicated that \"ownership of real property is effective upon registration of that property under Kuwaiti law.\" Tr. H., p. 96:19-20. Claimant has neither contested this assertion nor offered an alternative interpretation of the relevant provision of Kuwaiti law.\n\nTr. H., pp. 85:24-25, and 86:1.\n\n58.\n\nOnce again, the Tribunal is of the view that, while it must take the facts as given by the Claimant as true, it is not to turn a blind eye as to what the evidence provided shows on its face. In this case, it is obvious that an essential element for the Claimant\u2019s expropriation claim is missing, *i.e.* the existence of property rights in accordance with the laws of Kuwait. Therefore, the legal premise that it owns 5% of the land which was expropriated by the Respondent manifestly lacks legal merit.\n\n**IV. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n59.\n\nAs stated in the procedural history, the Parties were invited to make their submission on costs. Having not received Claimant\u2019s submission on costs, the Tribunal examined the Respondent\u2019s Submission on Costs and found it reasonable under the circumstances of the case. It decided to ignore the Claimant\u2019s failure to submit its statement on costs and expenses, because in any event, as explained below, it has determined that the Claimant has to bear them.\n\n60.\n\nArticle 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides that \"the Tribunal shall, except, as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.\"\n\n61.\n\nThis provision grants the Tribunal with authority and discretion to allocate costs and fees. In the excercise of such authority and discretion,45 the Tribunal notes that the practice varies from case to case in light of the particular circumanstances. In the present case, the Tribunal considers that costs should follow the event.\n\n*See* *Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20, Award, 14 July 2010, para. 152; *Cortec Mining Kenya Limited, Cortec (Pty) Limited and Stirling Capital Limited v. Republic of Kenya,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/29, Award, 22 October 2018, para. 388; *PNG Sustainable Development Program Ltd. v. Independent State of Papua New Guinea,* ICSID Case No. ARB/13/33, Award, 5 May 2015, paras. 400-403; *CEAC Holdings Limited v. Montenegro,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/8, Award, 26 July 2016, paras. 220-221. *See also* *CEAC Holdings Limited v. Montenegro,* ICSID Case No. ARB/14/8, Decision on Annulment, 1 May 2018, paras. 150-151; *RSM Production Corporation and others v. Grenada,* ICSID Case No. ARB/10/6, Award, 10 December 2010, para. 8.3.4.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent has been succesful in defeding its Objection on the grounds that the Claimant\u2019s claims are \"manifestly without legal merit\", pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the Arbitraton Rules. The claim was brought without complying with the requirements established in Article 10(2) of the BIT and the Claimant failed to demostrate that it had a property right in accordace with the laws of Kuwait in order to bring an expropriation claim under Article 7 of the BIT. Thus, the claim should have never been brought in the first place.\n\n63.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal\u2019s findings, the Tribunal deems appropriate to order the Claimant to bear its fees and expenses as well as the Repondent\u2019s fees and expenses, which in the view of the Tribunal are reasonable.\n\n64.\n\nThe costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID\u2019s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to:46\n\n**Arbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses**\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Prof. Ricardo Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez | US$ 95,218.60 |\n| Mr. Pascal D\u00e9vaud | US$ 112,858.1147 |\n| Prof. Dr. Rolf Knieper | US$ 38,822.22 |\n| **ICSID\u2019s administrative fees** | US$ 84,000.00 |\n| **Direct expenses (estimated)48** | US$ 22,460.27 |\n| **Total** | **US$ 353,359.20** |\n\nThe ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed Financial Statement of the case account once all invoices are received and the account is final.\n\nDue to the default in the payment of advances in this case, the Tribunal wishes to note that there was a total of US$8,124.94 of additional fees which are owed to Mr. D\u00e9vaud. Therefore, the total amount that Mr. D\u00e9vaud would have claimed in this case would have been US$120,983.05.\n\nThis amount includes estimated charges relating to the dispatch of this Award (courier, printing and copying).\n\n65.\n\nThe Claimant advanced to the Centre US$149,935 and Respondent advanced $200,000.49 Given the outcome of the proceeding, the Tribunal deems appropriate to order the Claimant to bear the arbitration costs.\n\nOn 12 September 2019, pursuant to Regulation 14(3)(d), the Secretary-General informed the parties of the default and gave an opportunity to either of them to make the required payment. On 30 October 2019, the Tribunal once more invited either party to make the required payment.  \nIf there is to be a remaining balance, this will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.\n\n**V. DECISION**\n---------------\n\n66.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides:\n\n67.\n\nTo accept the Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objection that the Claimant\u2019s claims manifestly lacks legal merit due to the Claimant\u2019s obvious non-compliance with Article 10(2) of the BIT.\n\n68.\n\nTo accept the Respondent\u2019s preliminary objection that the expropriation claim manifestly lacks legal merit since it is obvious that an essential element for the Claimant's expropriation claim is missing, *i.e.* the existence of property rights in accordance with the laws of Kuwait.\n\n69.\n\nThat the Claimant shall bear all the costs of this proceeding, including fees and expenses of the Members of the Tribunal. Therefore, the Claimant shall pay the Respondent US$ 200,000 in arbitration costs, and the legal costs incurred by Kuwait, in the amount of US$ 612,986.39.\n\n70.\n\nThis Award is adopted by a majority vote of two to one. Mr. Pascal D\u00e9vaud is dissenting."}]}
