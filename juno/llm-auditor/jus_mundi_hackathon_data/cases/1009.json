The majority has not, as is unfortunately all too common in this field, belittled the complexity of the problem or ignored the competing arguments in justifying its conclusion.\n\n2.\n\nAs a result my dissent can be expressed succinctly. I disagree with the majority's ultimate conclusion that a controlling shareholder of a company has a free hand in choosing whether to bring a claim for reflective loss in its own name or whether to bring a claim on behalf of the company for its direct loss under Article 10.16.1 of DR-CAFTA. Article 10.16.1 reads:\n\n1. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:\n\n(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement;\n\nand\n\n(ii) that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach; and\n\n(b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim\n\n(i) that the respondent has breached\n\n(A) an obligation under Section A,\n\n(B) an investment authorization, or\n\n(C) an investment agreement; and\n\n(ii) that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\n\n3.\n\nThe Claimants' primary submission on the ordinary meaning of the words of Article 10.16.1 is that the use of the word \"*may*\" (i.e. the \"*claimant\u2026 may submit to arbitration*\") rather than \"*shall*\" indicates that a claimant has complete discretion as to whether to pursue a claim under either limb of Article 10.16.1.1 But that argument is fallacious: claimants cannot be mandated to submit their claims to arbitration\u2014their consent is always required\u2014and hence the word \"*shall*\" could not have been used in this context. The majority of the Tribunal does not itself rely on this argument and their analysis of the ordinary meaning of the words leads them to the conclusion that it is not dispositive one way or another on the issue. With this I agree.\n\nE.g. Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, \u00a721.\n\n4.\n\nOnce, however, the other provisions of Chapter 10 of DR-CAFTA are factored into the interpretation of Article 10.16.1 as the relevant \"*context*\" in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention, to my mind the proper conclusion comes into sharp focus.\n\n5.\n\nArticle 10.18, which is entitled \"*Conditions and Limitations on Consent of Each Party*\", sets out a sophisticated mechanism to ensure that there will be no multiplicity of claims in domestic and international fora. A claimant must provide, with its notice of arbitration, a written waiver \"*of any right to initiate or continue before any administrative tribunal or court under the law of any Party, or other dispute settlement procedures, any proceeding with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach referred to in Article 10.16.*\" If the controlling shareholder brings a claim under Article 10.16.1(b) on behalf of its company, then it has to provide a waiver both for itself and the company (Article 10.18.2(b)(ii)). The result is that the controlling shareholder and the company cannot pursue remedies in different fora in respect of the same alleged prejudice.\n\n6.\n\nArticle 10.26 then extends the logical consequences of this waiver requirement in Article 10.18. If a claim is brought on behalf of the company pursuant to Article 10.16.1(b), then Article 10.26.2(b) directs that any damages awarded must be paid to the company and not to the controlling shareholder. There is then no risk of double recovery because the controlling shareholder and the company would have previously waived the pursuit of any other remedy in respect of the same prejudice. Article 10.26.2(c) then states that \"*the award shall provide that it is made without prejudice to any right that any person may have in the relief under applicable domestic law*\". This provision evidences a clear concern with the protection of the rights of any creditors of the company (secured and unsecured commercial creditors, involuntary creditors such as tort victims of the company's activities, the tax authorities, and so on).\n\n7.\n\nThe question is then whether these provisions, and the obvious mischief that they seek to prevent, can be bypassed simply by the controlling shareholder bringing a claim for reflective loss instead under Article 10.16.1(a)? (No requirement of a waiver by the company or payment of damages to the company or a provision for the protection of the company's creditors is contemplated for claims under Article 10.16.1(a).)\n\n8.\n\nThe question can be tied to the facts of the present case: is it permissible for Mr Kappes and KCA, as the controlling shareholders of Exmingua, to bring a claim before this Tribunal for reflective loss in respect of alleged prejudice to Exmingua, and at the same time for Exmingua to maintain its claim in respect of the same prejudice before the Constitutional Court of Guatemala? Can the risk of double recovery be countenanced? And if Mr Kappes and KCA are ultimately successful on the merits, can they avoid satisfying the legitimate claims of the creditors of Exmingua by recovering damages directly rather than through the company?\n\n9.\n\nIf these questions are answered affirmatively, as the majority has decided, then the specific objectives underlying Articles 10.18 and 10.26\u2014the prevention of multiple claims in respect of the same prejudice, the avoidance of double recovery and the protection of the company's creditors\u2014can be defeated by the simple election of the claimant under Article 10.16.1.\n\n10.\n\nThis is where I respectfully depart from the majority's reasoning. They have considered the *effet utile* principle in relation to Article 10.16.1(b) in isolation of the context provided by Articles 10.18 and 10.26. The *effet utile* principle, however, must be applied to all the express provisions of Chapter 10 of DR-CAFTA. If a particular interpretation of Article 10.16.1 fatally undermines Articles 10.18 and 10.26, then the obvious inference to be drawn is that that interpretation is wrong.\n\n11.\n\nConsider Article 10.18.4, for instance, which provides:\n\nNo claim may be submitted to arbitration:\n\n(a) for breach of an investment authorization under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(B) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(B), or\n\n(b) for breach of an investment agreement under Article 10.16.1(a)(i)(C) or Article 10.16.1(b)(i)(C),\n\nif the claimant (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a)) or the claimant or the enterprise (for claims brought under Article 10.16.1(b)) has previously submitted the same alleged breach to an administrative tribunal or court of the respondent, or to any other binding dispute settlement procedure, for adjudication or resolution.\n\n12.\n\nIf the majority is correct, then it would appear to follow that a company can bring a claim for breach of an investment agreement pursuant to the arbitration clause in that agreement, and, if it is unsuccessful, its controlling shareholder can then bring the same claim to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a) of DR-CAFTA. Article 10.8.4, which is obviously designed to avoid the multiplicity of claims relating to the same prejudice, is thereby emptied of practical utility.\n\n13.\n\nIn isolating Article 10.16.1 from the other provisions of Chapter 10 of DR-CAFTA in this way, the majority has also, in my respectful opinion, asked the wrong question. They have asked whether Article 10.16.1(b) would be deprived of an *effet utile*from the perspective of the putative claimants, who are obviously not parties to the treaty and had no hand in drafting its provisions. They have answered that question by pointing to certain (hypothetical) advantages to claimants in pursuing claims on behalf of the company under Article 10.16.1(b) rather than claims for reflective loss under Article 10.16.1(a). In other words, if a rational claimant acting in its self-interest might go down the route of Article 10.16.1(b), f or reasons subjective to that claimant, then for the majority an *effet utile* is established for that provision.2\n\nThe majority considers that they are justified in asking this question because that it how the case was put (FN 149). There is no harm in asking this question to test the reasonableness or otherwise of a particular interpretation of Article 10.16.1 arrived at by applying Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. But it cannot be the legitimate question to ask for the purposes of arriving at that interpretation in the first place consistently with Article 31: the subjective preferences of non-parties to DR-CAFTA are not an element that can be taken into account unless it can be demonstrated that the State Parties drafted Article 10.16.1 to give effect to those subjective preferences. The context provides no evidence for that assumption but instead positively refutes it (see Articles 10.18 and 10.26).\n\n14.\n\nFormulating the question in this way assumes what needs to be proven by reference to the context to be established in accordance with Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. The assumption is that the idea animating the State Parties in drafting Article 10.16.1 was to confer the broadest possible flexibility to controlling shareholders in advancing their claims against the respondent States. There is no basis for that assumption in the treaty itself. To the contrary, what is expressed in the treaty is that the State Parties were motivated to ensure that controlling shareholders could not bring a claim in their own right and at the same time direct their company to pursue other remedies in different fora (Article 10.18). What is also expressed in the treaty is that the State Parties were motivated to ensure that there would be no risk of double recovery and that the rights of creditors of the company would not be undermined or extinguished as result of paying damages directly to shareholders rather than through the company (Article 10.26). This is the relevant and permissible context to take into account pursuant to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention: it is derived from an analysis of the express terms of the treaty.\n\n15.\n\nIf that context is taken into account, then Article 10.16.1 must be interpreted as directing controlling shareholders to channel claims relating to prejudice to companies through the bespoke mechanism of Article 10.16.1(b).\n\n16.\n\nAlthough it is by no means conclusive, the fact that all three State Parties to NAFTA have taken the same view in respect of the substantially similar provisions in Articles 1116 and 1117 confirms this interpretation.3 The following was the US Government's understanding of what it had just signed when NAFTA was sent to Congress:\n\nArticles 1116 and 1117 set forth the kinds of claims that may be submitted to arbitration: respectively, allegations of direct injury to an investor, and allegations of indirect injury to an investor caused by injury to a firm in the host country that is owned or controlled by the investor.4\n\nUSA: *Pope & Talbot Inc. v Government of Canada*, Seventh Submission from the United States of America, 6 November 2001, \u00a7\u00a73-5, RL-0071; *GAMI v Mexico*, Submission of the United States of America, 30 June 2003, \u00a714, RL-0072; *William Ralph Clayton, & Bilcon of Delaware Inc. et al. v. Government of Canada*, PCA Case No. 2009-04, Submission of the United States of America, 29 December 2017, \u00a712, RL-0008.  \nCanada: *Clayton v Canada*, Government of Canada Counter-Memorial on Damages, 9 June 2017, \u00a728, RL-0017; S.D. Myers, Counter-Memorial (Damages Phase), 7 June 2001, \u00a7\u00a7108-109, RL-0075.  \nMexico: *GAMI v Mexico*, Statement of Defense, 24 November 2003, \u00a7\u00a7167(e) and (h), RL-0076.\n\nUS Government, The NAFTA Implementation Act, Statement of Administrative Action, p. 146, RL-0070.\n\n17.\n\nIn one of the early NAFTA cases, the tribunal in *Mondev v USA* highlighted the importance of the distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117:\n\nHaving regard to the distinctions drawn between claims brought under Articles 1116 and 1117, a NAFTA tribunal should be careful not to allow any recovery, in a claim that should have been brought under Article 1117, to be paid directly to the investor.5\n\n*Mondev v USA*, Award, 11 October 2002, (Sir Ninian Stephens, Prof. James Crawford, Judge Stephen Schwebel), \u00a786, RL-018.\n\n18.\n\nThe distinction was considered more recently by the tribunal in *Clayton v Canada* :\n\n[\u2026] The terms of Article 1116 do not make clear whether they are limited to direct loss or they can include indirect loss that is, reflective loss.\n\nHowever, if the words of Article 1116 are to be read \"in their context\" then Article 1117 has to be considered. This provision allows an investor to claim for loss to an enterprise thus providing for the recovery of reflective loss. As a result, to permit reflective loss to be recovered under Article 1116 would raise questions about the relationship between the two provisions perhaps rendering Article 1117 inutile. This is the point made by the Respondent. The Investors argue that the potential for conflict only arises when claims are brought under both Article 1116 and Article 1117, but this only reinforces the question of why Article 1117 was included into NAFTA if claims can be brought for reflective loss under Article 1116.\n\nBoth the Respondent and the United States in their submissions argue that the inclusion of separate provisions in Article 1116 and Article 1117 was deliberate. Article 1116 gave effect to the traditional rule of customary international law that a party can sue for its losses arising out of the breach of an international obligation. Article 1117 was designed to permit claims by an investor on behalf of its investment, thus permitting a claim for reflective loss. In the absence of that provision a claim for reflective loss would otherwise be barred under customary international law by virtue of the ICJ judgment in Barcelona Traction, which rejected the right of shareholders to bring claims in place of the corporation.\n\nThe Tribunal finds this to be a plausible explanation for the existence of the two separate provisions in NAFTA Chapter Eleven, which would argue against overlap between them and would mean that reflective loss could not be recovered under Article 1116.6\n\n*Clayton v Canada*, Award on Damages, 10 January 2019 (Judge Bruno Simma, Prof. Don McCrae, Prof. Bryan Schwartz), \u00a7\u00a7371-4, CL-0070.\n\n19.\n\nReturning to the majority's reasoning in this case, even if it were permissible to interpret Article 10.16.1 through the eyes of putative claimants in a manner that defeats the utility of other express provisions of the treaty, I am not persuaded that the suggested reasons why a rational claimant might elect to pursue a claim under Article 10.16.1(b) rather than Article 10.16.1(a) are particularly good ones.\n\n20.\n\nThe only such reason advanced by the Claimants in this case is that there may be tax or currency conversion advantages in bringing a claim on behalf of the company rather than as a shareholder's claim for reflective loss.7 But did the State Parties really draft Article 10.16.1 with the objective of allowing claimants to minimize their tax burden or currency exchange costs in mind? That seems rather unlikely and there is of course no evidence for that hypothesis.\n\nTranscript of 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 101, 204.\n\n21.\n\nThe majority postulates instead that a controlling shareholder, who nevertheless does not hold all of the shares, might elect to pursue a claim on behalf of the company so that potentially greater damages covering the company's entire loss can be recovered, thereby restoring the company to full health. It is true that a controlling shareholder might do that even if we know empirically that precious few have gone down that route when it has been available (e.g. when the mechanism under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention applies). But the critical point is that we cannot look at this exclusively from the vantage point of putative claimants. Are the serious policy objectives underlying Articles 10.18 and 10.26 intended to be contingent upon the benevolence of the claimant in electing to restore the company to its full health rather than bypassing the company (and its creditors) and recovering directly? It seems highly improbable that the State Parties would attempt to erect a bulwark against the familiar problems associated with reflective loss claims (multiplicity of proceedings, risk of double recovery, evisceration of creditors' rights) and at the same time provide claimants with the means to run straight through it.\n\n22.\n\nThe majority finally cites the complexities of proving causation and quantum when a shareholder claims that a loss to the company has resulted in a loss to the value of its shares. They argue that a controlling shareholder may thus elect to bring a claim on behalf of the company to avoid these potential hurdles.\n\n23.\n\nThere is a certain irony to this point. One of the reasons that systems of municipal law and the other branches of international law do not allow unrestricted reflective loss claims is precisely because their quantification is fraught with conceptual difficulties. What happens, to take a few banal examples, if shares in a going concern increase in value after the alleged breach or after the award? Or if the company has a policy of reinvesting profits rather than paying dividends? Or has a substantial debt that must be serviced to third parties before dividends can be paid? Until recently, tribunals in investment treaty cases were content to ignore these difficulties altogether and simply award a shareholder a percentage of the value of the company at the date of the breach commensurate with the size of its shareholding. Perhaps an outlier in the early days of the jurisprudence was the award in *Nykomb v Latvia* (as cited by the majority) where it was recognized that things were not quite that simple. But the concession to complexity in that award did not translate into a sophisticated solution: after recognizing that there is no 1:1 relationship between income to a company and income to a 100% shareholder, the tribunal simply divided the company's income by a factor of 3 to quantify the shareholder's reflective loss. No justification was given for that figure. It was plucked straight from the stratosphere.\n\n24.\n\nIt is true, as the majority suggests, that things have evolved and now the complexities attending the quantification of reflective loss claims are more likely to be taken into account by a tribunal. But did the State Parties in drafting Article 10.16.1 really: (i) envisage that reflective loss claims on an unrestricted basis would be permitted by investment tribunals as a matter of principle given that customary international law rejects this, international human rights law rejects this and municipal systems of law recognizing the institution of a limited liability company reject this and (ii) contemplate that the same early decisions of investment tribunals permitting reflective loss claims would later be discredited in respect of their approach to the quantification of damages such that (iii) it was prudent to allow controlling shareholders to avoid the hurdles imposed by the recent, more robust approach to quantification of damages for reflective loss claims by opening up a route to claim on behalf of the company?8\n\nI do not agree with the majority that a more careful approach to quantifying a reflective loss claim entails that creditors' rights are thereby preserved \"*because shareholders in these circumstances do not recover any proceeds that properly were due to creditors*\" (FN 176). There is a massive difference between (i) creditors actually getting paid because compensation for prejudice to the company passes through the company (creditors would have preference over the shareholders in this scenario) and (ii) funds due to creditors not being included in the mathematical calculation of reflective loss to a controlling shareholder. The reality in the vast majority of cases is surely that if a company suffers substantial prejudice on account of measures attributable to the host State and damages are awarded to the controlling shareholder directly rather than through the company, then that company is unlikely to be able to trade out of difficulties and pay the amounts owing to creditors when they fall due. The rights of creditors become illusory as a practical matter if a controlling shareholder has the option of bypassing the company. This is precisely one of the reasons that no other branch of the law allows unrestricted claims for reflective loss by shareholders.\n\n25.\n\nOr did the State Parties simply intend that claims relating to a loss to a company be brought on behalf of the company?\n\n26.\n\nThe majority recognizes that multiplicity of claims, the risk of double recovery and the evisceration of creditors' rights are serious problems attending the pursuit of reflective loss claims. But the majority ultimately concludes that these are policy considerations that are not for a tribunal to grapple with in the interpretation of Article 10.16.1. This is nub of my disagreement. These policy considerations are manifest in the express provisions of the same Chapter 10 of DR-CAFTA in which Article 10.16.1 is embedded. The choice ultimately boils down to interpreting Article 10.16.1 to operate consistently with Articles 10.18 and 10.26 and the policies they promote, or interpreting Article 10.16.1 to render Articles 10.18 and 10.26 moot for all practical purposes. I consider that Article 31 of the Vienna Convention and the principle of *effet utile* mandate the former approach.\n\n27.\n\nI finally note that the Claimants in this case have offered no explanation as to why they did not simply file a claim on behalf of their company, Exmingua, under Article 10.16.1(b). Nor have they suggested that there was any impediment to do so. In this case there will, therefore, be multiple proceedings, a risk of double recovery and the possibility that Exmingua's creditors will be left out of pocket in respect of their legitimate claims\u2014in order to satisfy an unarticulated preference of Exmingua's shareholders to seek compensation directly.\n\n28.\n\nMy dissent is partial in several respects. First, even on my reading of Article 10.16.1, the Claimants would not be prevented from pursuing their claim for the expropriation of their shares in Exmingua because such a claim is cognizable under Article 10.16.1(a)\u2014it is a claim to vindicate their legal rights as shareholders rather than their mere economic interest in the value of Exmingua's shares. Second, I join the majority without reservation in the Tribunal's decisions on the Respondent's second and third objections on the premise that the majority prevails in respect of its disposal of the first objection."}], "Content": "Decision on Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**Frequently Used Abbreviations and Acronyms**\n----------------------------------------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| CALAS | Centro International de Acci\u00f3n Legal y Social de Guatemala, a Guatemalan non-governmental organization |\n| Claimants | Mr. Kappes and KCA together |\n| Claimants\u2019 Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial | Claimants' Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections dated 27 September 2019 |\n| Claimants\u2019 Preliminary Objections Rejoinder | Claimants' Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections dated 22 November 2019 |\n| DR-CAFTA or the \"Treaty\" or \"CAFTA-DR\" | Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement |\n| EIA | Environmental Impact Assessment |\n| Exh.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Dominican Republic-Central American-United States Free Trade Agreement (\"**DR-CAFTA**\" or the \"Treaty\"),1 which entered into force for Guatemala on July 1, 2006, and for the United States on March 1, 2006, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\nThe DR-CAFTA is sometimes referred to, alternatively, as the CAFTA-DR.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimants are Mr. Daniel W. Kappes (\"**Mr. Kappes**\") and Kappes, Cassiday & Associates (\"**KCA**\"), hereinafter referred to as \"**Claimants**.\" Mr. Kappes is a natural person having the nationality of United States of America. KCA is a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada. Claimants state that Mr. Kappes owns 100% of the shares in KCA.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Guatemala and is hereinafter referred to as \"**Guatemala**\" or the \"**Respondent**.\"\n\n4.\n\nThis decision addresses Guatemala\u2019s preliminary objections under the expedited procedure of DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 16 May 2018, Claimants sent a \"Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration\" to Guatemala (the \"**Notice of Intent**\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 9 November 2018, Claimants commenced this arbitration by delivering a \"Notice of Arbitration\" to Respondent and ICSID, which was received by ICSID on the same day (the \"**Notice of Arbitration**\").\n\n7.\n\nOn 11 December 2018, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the case in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n8.\n\nPursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.19, Claimants appointed Mr. John M. Townsend, a national of the United States, and Respondent appointed Prof. Zachary Douglas, a national of Australia, as arbitrators. Following a successful ballot procedure, the parties appointed Ms. Jean Kalicki, a national of the United States, to be the President of the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n9.\n\nOn 2 July 2019, the Secretary-General notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"**Arbitration Rules**\") and the DR-CAFTA. Mr. Francisco Grob, ICSID Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n10.\n\nOn 16 August 2019, the Republic of Guatemala submitted a Memorial on \"Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.5 of the CAFTA-DR\" (the **\"Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections Memorial**,\" and the objections presented therein, the \"**Preliminary Objections**\").\n\n11.\n\nOn 26 August 2019, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by teleconference. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed *inter alia* that the applicable ICSID Arbitration Rules would be those in effect as of April 10, 2006, except to the extent modified and/or supplemented by the DR-CAFTA. The procedural languages would be English and Spanish and the place of proceedings would be Washington, D.C.\n\n12.\n\nFollowing the First Session, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 dated 10 September 2019, concerning various procedural matters (\"**PO1**\"). In Annex B to that Order, the Tribunal set a procedural timetable for the Parties' pleadings, including in respect of the Preliminary Objections.\n\n13.\n\nAs scheduled, Claimants filed their \"Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections\" on 27 September 2019 (the \"**Claimants\u2019 Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial**\"), Respondent filed its \"Reply to Claimants\u2019 Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections under Article 10.20.5 of the CAFTA-DR\" on 25 October 2019 (**\"Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections Reply**\"), and Claimants filed their \"Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections\" on 22 November 2019 (the **\"Claimants\u2019 Preliminary Objections Rejoinder\"**).\n\n14.\n\nOn 23 October 2019, La Puya, which describes itself as an environmental justice movement comprising community members from San Jos\u00e9 del Golfo and San Pedro Ayampuc, Guatemala (\"**La Puya**\"), submitted an \"Amici Curiae Application for Leave to File Non-Disputing Party Submissions\" in this proceeding. Pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.3 and Section 18.2 of PO1, the Tribunal invited the Parties to provide their observations on the application. As scheduled, each party filed its observations on October 31, 2019.\n\n15.\n\nOn 7 November 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 reserving its decision on La Puya\u2019s application, on the ground that it was premature, until after its decision on Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections (\"**PO2**\").\n\n16.\n\nOn 20 November 2019, ICSID circulated to the Parties a draft Hearing Protocol prepared by the Tribunal. The Parties were invited to consider and discuss all open issues in the draft, as well as any other items they may have wished to add to the agenda. On 25 November 2019, the Parties submitted their comments indicating various items for the Tribunal\u2019s resolution.\n\n17.\n\nOn 26 November 2019, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties by telephone conference.\n\n18.\n\nOn 27 November 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 establishing a protocol for the hearing (\"**PO3**\").\n\n19.\n\nOn 16 December 2019, the Tribunal held a public hearing on Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections at the World Bank Offices in Washington, D.C. Attending the hearing were:\n\nTribunal Members:  \nMs. Jean Kalicki, President of the Tribunal  \nMr. John Townsend, Arbitrator  \nProf. Zachary Douglas, Arbitrator\n\nICSID Secretariat:  \nMr. Francisco Grob, Secretary of the Tribunal  \nMs. Daniela Arg\u00fcello, Legal Counsel\n\nFor Claimant:  \nMr. Daniel W. Kappes, Kappes, Cassiday & Associates  \nMs. Andrea Menaker, White & Case LLP  \nMr. Rafael Llano, White & Case LLP  \nMr. Eckhard Hellbeck, White & Case LLP  \nMs. Agnieszka Zarowna, White & Case LLP  \nMs. Victoria Todria, White & Case LLP\n\nFor Respondent:  \nMr. Adolfo E. Jim\u00e9nez, Holland & Knight LLP  \nMr. Brian A. Briz, Holland & Knight LLP  \nMs. Katharine Men\u00e9ndez de la Cuesta, Holland & Knight LLP  \nMs. Arantxa Cuadrado, Holland & Knight LLP  \nJoining by broadcast:  \nMs. Ana Luisa Gatica Palacios, Procuradur\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n, Guatemala  \nMr. Mario M\u00e9rida, Procuradur\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n, Guatemala  \nMs. Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez, Procuradur\u00eda General de la Naci\u00f3n, Guatemala\n\nInterpreters:  \nDaniel Giglio, Spanish-English Interpreter  \nSilvia Colla, Spanish-English Interpreter  \nCharles Roberts, Spanish-English Interpreter\n\nCourt Reporters:  \nDavid Kasdan  \nD-R Esteno\n\n20.\n\nOn 19 December 2019, the Tribunal inquired whether the Parties would have any objection if the Tribunal were to invoke DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5, postponing the deadline for its decision on the Preliminary Objections for 30 days until 13 March 2020. Both Parties confirmed that they had no objections.\n\n21.\n\nThe day after, 20 December 2019, the Parties also advised the Tribunal of their agreement not to file post-hearing briefs for this phase of the proceeding.\n\n22.\n\nOn 11 February 2020, the Secretariat advised the Parties that the Tribunal had invoked Article 10.20.5 of DR-CAFTA, as previously discussed with the Parties, with the effect of postponing the deadline for its ruling on the Preliminary Objections until 13 March 2020.\n\n23.\n\nThe Parties made their submissions on costs on 14 February 2020.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AS ALLEGED BY CLAIMANTS**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nThe following summary is drawn from Claimants\u2019 pleadings to date, because DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c) provides that, \"[i]n deciding an objection under this paragraph, the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant\u2019s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration.\" The Tribunal emphasizes that it has made no factual findings in these proceedings.\n\n25.\n\nClaimants allege to have invested in two mining projects for the exploitation and exportation of gold and silver through Exploraciones Mineras de Guatemala S.A. (\"**Exmingua\"**), a company incorporated under the laws of Guatemala.2\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 3.\n\n26.\n\nExmingua\u2019s direct shareholders are Mr. Kappes and Minerales KC Guatemala, Ltda. (\"**Minerales KC**\"), a Guatemalan company. Since 2012, Mr. Kappes directly owns 25% of Exmingua and Minerales KC owns the remaining 75%. The shares of Minerales KC in turn are owned by KCA, the second Claimant in this proceeding (which owns 90% of the Minerales KC shares, and thus indirectly owns 67.50% of Exmingua), and Mr. Kappes (who owns the remaining 10% of Minerales KC's shares).3\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6\u00b6 7-8, 35.\n\n27.\n\nClaimants allege that as direct and indirect owners of Exmingua, they acquired all legal and beneficial rights, title, and interest in two neighboring mining projects located within the orogenic Regional Gold Belt (Cintur\u00f3n Regional de Oro) called \"Tambor\" in Guatemala: (1) Progreso VII Derivada (the \"**Progreso VII Project**\"), a gold and silver mining project located in the municipalities of San Jos\u00e9 del Golfo and San Pedro Ayampuc; and (2) Santa Margarita (the \"**Santa Margarita Project**\"), also a gold and silver mining project, which is located in the municipality of San Pedro Ayampuc adjacent to the Progreso VII Project.4\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 36.\n\n28.\n\nAccording to Claimants, after conducting the required consultations with local communities and meeting all other legal requirements, Progreso Project VII was granted a 25-year exploitation license in 2011, which was followed later that year by a one-year renewable certificate of exportation for gold and silver.5 Exmingua also held an exploration license for Santa Margarita, which it had acquired in 2005.6\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 40.\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 46.\n\n29.\n\nIn early 2012, the Progreso VII Project began construction and Claimants allege that one month later, members of the communities near the project, supported by non-governmental organizations, blockaded access to the mine. Claimants state that two months later Exmingua obtained police support to attempt to break the resistance at the mining site, but the protesters denied them passage and the police left. Exmingua further sought assistance from various local and national government authorities, with no success.\n\n30.\n\nClaimants assert that the State failed to take meaningful or effective action to stop the ongoing, unlawful blockade of the Progreso VII Project and thus on 3 September 2012, Exmingua filed an *amparo* action (a form of request for constitutional protection) against the General Director of the National Police.7 The Second Judicial Court of Appeals granted the *amparo* to Exmingua.8\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 43.\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 44.\n\n31.\n\nIn their Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial, Claimants indicate that, as a result of the *amparo,* in May 2014 Respondent\u2019s national police broke through the blockade and evicted the protesters from the site.9 Exploitation activities at Progreso VII resumed and Exmingua made its first concentrate shipment.10\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 118; *see also* Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 139-140.\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 45.\n\n32.\n\nOn 28 August 2014, the *Centro International de Acci\u00f3n Legal y Social de Guatemala* (\"**CALAS**\"), a Guatemalan non-governmental organization, filed an *amparo* action against the Ministry of Energy and Mines of Guatemala (\"**MEM**\"), claiming that Exmingua\u2019s exploitation license had been wrongfully granted, due to the lack of consultations with local communities pursuant to the Convention concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (the \"**ILO Convention**\").\n\n33.\n\nOn 11 November 2015, the Guatemalan Supreme Court granted an *amparo provisional* against the MEM, suspending the exploitation license for the Progreso Project VII. Exmingua appealed this ruling to the Constitutional Court on 23 February 2016.11\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 54.\n\n34.\n\nClaimants contend in their Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial that the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling provoked confusion and controversy, which gave rise to a new wave of protests in early 2016.12 Claimants further allege that this \"new wave of protests and blockades, and Respondent\u2019s associated failure to provide full protection and security\" is what prevented Exmingua from carrying out the social consultations and completing the Environmental Impact Assessment (\"**EIA**\") for the Santa Margarita Project, in furtherance of its application for an exploitation license.13\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 121; *see also* Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 139.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 122.\n\n35.\n\nIn March 2016, the MEM issued a resolution suspending Exmingua's right to exploit gold and silver.14 Two months later, the MEM issued another resolution suspending Exmingua's certificate of exportation.15\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 55.\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 55.\n\n36.\n\nIn response, Exmingua filed on 22 April 2016, an *amparo* against the President of Guatemala, the MEM, and the General Directorate of the National Police. The *amparo* was denied.16\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 56.\n\n37.\n\nOn 5 May 2016, the Guatemalan Constitutional Court confirmed the *amparo provisional* that the Supreme Court had granted against the MEM in November 2015 at CALAS' request, and ruled that Exmingua's exploitation license for the Progreso VII Project could regain effectiveness only after consultations with the local communities had been conducted and completed pursuant to the ILO Convention.17 On the same date, the Guatemalan Attorney General filed a criminal action against four Exmingua workers, claiming that they were carrying concentrate and thus illegally exploiting natural resources in contravention of Guatemalan Court Rulings, and the concentrate they were carrying was impounded. The workers eventually were acquitted, but the concentrate shipment remains impounded.18\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 57.\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 58.\n\n38.\n\nOn 28 June 2016, the Guatemalan Supreme Court granted an *amparo definitivo* against the Progreso VII Project, which had been sought by CALAS. As a result, Exmingua's exploitation license was definitively suspended until consultations with local communities were conducted. On June 30, 2016, Exmingua appealed the Supreme Court's 2016 *amparo* decision to the Constitutional Court. Claimants allege that this appeal remains pending.19\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 59.\n\n39.\n\nOn 21 December 2016, the MEM directed Exmingua to file the EIA for the Santa Margarita Project, duly approved by the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (\"**MARN**\"), within 30 days. Claimants state that due to the \"continuous and systemic protests and blockades at the site since 2012,\" Exmingua's consultants could not gain access to the site to complete the local consultations required for the EIA.20 Therefore, Exmingua asked the MEM to suspend the EIA requirement for the social study, including the approval by the MARN, until it was possible to complete the consultations.\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6\u00b6 48, 49.\n\n40.\n\nClaimants explain in their Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial that on 5 April 2017, the MEM issued Resolution No. 1191, denying Exmingua's request to suspend the EIA requirement to conduct local consultations, and directed Exmingua to file the EIA for its Santa Margarita Project within 30 days.21 In response, Exmingua submitted the EIA for Santa Margarita that had been prepared several years earlier, before work was stopped to focus on the Progreso VII site, without the section on the social studies. According to Claimants, Exmingua did not receive any response from the MARN.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 123-125.\n\n41.\n\nIn May 2017, the Guatemalan Constitutional Court ruled on an appeal lodged by Oxec, a local company indirectly controlled by Guatemalan nationals, whose license the Supreme Court had found to have been wrongfully granted on the same legal basis as Exmingua's (the ***\"Oxec*** **case**\"). Claimants allege that, unlike in the case of Exmingua, the Constitutional Court decided the appeal in the *Oxec* case in a mere three months, and permitted Oxec to continue operating while the State conducted consultations. Such consultations were completed within only a few months.22\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6\u00b6 61-62.\n\n42.\n\nOn 8 June 2017, Exmingua applied to revoke the Constitutional Court's ruling dated 5 May 2016, by reference to the Court's ruling in the *Oxec* case. This request, however, was rejected by the Constitutional Court on 5 October 2017.23\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 60.\n\n43.\n\nIn another case (the ***\"Escobal*** **case**\"), Claimants allege that the Constitutional Court decided an *amparo* filed by a Guatemalan national in less than a year, albeit by rejecting the *amparo* on its substance. The *Escobal* case concerns a large silver mine operated and developed by Minera San Rafael, S.A., the Guatemalan subsidiary of Tahoe Resources, a Canadian mining company. This project was suspended on 5 July 2017, after the Guatemalan Supreme Court granted an *amparo provisional* sought by CALAS. The Guatemalan Supreme Court reinstated Escobal's mining license in September 2017, but only one month later, the project was again suspended on appeal. On 3 September 2018, the Constitutional Court ruled that the Escobal mining license would remain suspended until the MEM completed public consultations in accordance with the ILO Convention.24\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 63.\n\n44.\n\nClaimants state that, by contrast, the Progreso VII Project has been suspended for over two years while an appeal to the Constitutional Court has been pending and the MEM has taken no action to commence consultations.\n\n45.\n\nAs a result of these actions, Claimants allege in this proceeding that Guatemala has breached Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article 10.4 (Most Favored Nation Treatment), Article 10.5 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), and Article 10.7 (Expropriation and Compensation) of the DR-CAFTA. Compensation is sought for: (i) damages of no less than USD 175 million in connection with the Progreso VII Project; (ii) damages of no less than USD 175 million in connection with the Santa Margarita Project; (iii) damages of no less than USD 500,000 for the concentrate shipments impounded by the State.\n\n**IV. EXPEDITED PROCEDURE UNDER ARTICLE 10.20.5 OF DR-CAFTA**\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n46.\n\nRespondent submits that under Article 10.20.5 of DR-CAFTA, a tribunal may be asked to \"decide on an expedited basis\" two types of preliminary objections, namely: (i) \"as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made,\" as provided in Article 10.20.4 of DR-CAFTA; and (ii) \"the dispute is not within the tribunal\u2019s competence,\" as provided for in Article 10.20.5 of DR-CAFTA.\n\n47.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the key difference between these two types of objections is that, while those filed under Article 10.20.4 of DR-CAFTA require that the tribunal \"assume to be true claimant\u2019s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration,\" this requirement does not apply to objections to the tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction or the admissibility of claims under Article 10.20.5 of DR-CAFTA. Moreover, even under 10.20.4 of DR-CAFTA, \"[t]he tribunal may also consider any relevant facts not in dispute.\"25\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 34.\n\n48.\n\nIn response to Claimants\u2019 reliance on the *Pac Rim* preliminary objections decision,26 Respondent states that in this case its Article 10.20.5 objections do not present any complex questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact which might counsel against resolving such objections in an expedited procedure. In any event, Respondent says, even if such complex questions existed, DR-CAFTA does not limit preliminary objections to \"simple\" issues of law.27\n\n*Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador*, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Award, 14 October 2016 (hereinafter \"*Pac Rim*\").\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 18.\n\n49.\n\nIn addition, Respondent states that for purposes of its Preliminary Objections, it has assumed to be true all facts in the Notice of Arbitration. In Respondent\u2019s view, it is Claimants who have alleged new facts during the briefing of the Preliminary Objections, in an attempt to amend the allegations and claims in their earlier Notice of Arbitration to try to address the legal deficiencies contained therein. Respondent contends that in deciding the Preliminary Objections, the Tribunal may analyze only Claimants\u2019 alleged facts and claims as asserted in the Notice of Arbitration, and must reject any new allegation or evidence that Claimants belatedly seek to introduce.28\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 20.\n\n**b. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n50.\n\nClaimants assert not only that each of the three objections lacks merit, but also that Respondent inappropriately relies on disputed facts or fails to accept as true the facts alleged in Claimants\u2019 Notice of Arbitration, making its objections unsuitable for preliminary decision.29 Claimants also complain that Respondent repeatedly mischaracterizes Claimants\u2019 claims.30\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 3-5.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 2.\n\n51.\n\nClaimants also refer to the *Pac Rim* decision, where the tribunal noted that the expedited procedural timetable renders an Article 10.20.5 procedure unsuitable for objections that involve \"complex issues of law, still less legal issues dependent on complex questions of fact or mixed questions of law and fact.\"31 They recall that this procedure is \"not intended to be a 'mini-trial\u2019, even without evidence.\"32\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 5 (quoting *Pac Rim*, \u00b6 112).\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 107.\n\n52.\n\nNevertheless, Claimants point out that the Tribunal is empowered to consider facts beyond those set forth in Claimants\u2019 Notice of Arbitration in connection with Respondent\u2019s jurisdictional objections under Article 10.20.5. The limitation included in Article 10.20.4(c) does not apply to objections as to jurisdiction.33\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 144.\n\n**V. PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n53.\n\nRespondent argues that Claimants submitted their claims to arbitration without complying with several threshold requirements of the DR-CAFTA, as a result of which their claims must be dismissed on an expedited basis.34\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 25. Respondent emphasizes that its presentation of the Preliminary Objections is without prejudice to its right, which it expressly reserves, to raise further objections in any future phases of this Arbitration. *Id.*\n\n54.\n\nSpecifically, Respondent submits that the claims should be dismissed because: **(1)** Claimants are attempting to recover for themselves losses sustained directly by Exmingua, in violation of DR-CAFTA\u2019s procedural requirements; **(2)** Claimants are attempting to bring a Most-Favored-Nation Treatment (\"**MFN**\") claim without complying with the notice requirements under the Treaty; and **(3)** Claimants\u2019 claim for lack of full protection and security is time-barred under the DR-CAFTA and is not within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction.\n\n55.\n\nThe following chart provided by Respondent identifies its objections and the corresponding Treaty provisions. The Tribunal addresses each of these below.35\n\n|  |  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| **Section of Memorial** | **Affected Claims** | **Grounds for Dismissal** | **CAFTA-****DR** |\n|  |  | As a matter of law, no award in favor of Claimants can be made. | 10.20.4 and 10.16.1 |\n| **V.** | All Claims | The Claims are inadmissible. Claimants do not have standing to seek to recover Exmingua's losses. | 10.20.5 and 10.16.1 |\n| The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine the Claims for Exmingua\u2019s losses because Exmingua's waiver was not submitted with Claimants Notice of Arbitration. | 10.20.5 and 10.18.2 |\n| **VI.** | Most Favored Nation | The claim is inadmissible because it was not included in the Notice of Intent. | 10.20.5 and 10.16.2 |\n| **VII.** | Lack of Full Protection and Security | The Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide the claim because it is time barred. | 10.20.5 and 10.18.1 |\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 12.\n\n**(1) Availability of Article 10.16.1 for \"Indirect Loss\" Claims**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n56.\n\nRespondent states that Claimants are seeking to recover Exmingua\u2019s losses, yet Claimants have brought these claims on their *own* behalf under Article 10.16.1(a) of DR-CAFTA. In Respondent\u2019s view, that provision allows investors to recover only for their own losses, and not for the losses of a local enterprise in which they invested. Nor, Respondent says, does Article 10.16.1(a) permit \"reflective loss claims,\" *i.e.,* claims for a decrease in the value of a shareholding caused by injury to the company in which the shares are held. Rather, DR-CAFTA provides a unique mechanism to bring derivative claims under Article 10.16.1(b). Respondent argues that Claimants have failed to comply with the applicable procedure and requirements under either Article 10.16.1(a) or Article 10.16.1(b).36\n\n*See generally* Respondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 36-105 and Respondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 21-120.\n\n57.\n\nConsequently, Respondent asks the Tribunal to dismiss Claimants\u2019 claims based on: (*i*) Article 10.20.4 of CAFTA-DR, because as a matter of law these are not claims for which an award in favor of Claimants can be made under Article 10.26 of CAFTA-DR; (*ii*) Articles 10.20.5 and 10.16.1(a) of CAFTA-DR, because the claims are \"inadmissible\" as Claimants lack standing to seek to recover the losses or damages suffered by their local enterprise;37 and (*iii*) Articles 10.20.5 and 10.18.2 of CAFTA-DR, because Claimants\u2019 claims are not within the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction as Claimants did not submit a waiver of Exmingua\u2019s right to initiate or continue local litigation.38\n\n*See also* Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 32:6-35-2 (Respondent's explanations).\n\nIn response to a question during the hearing whether Respondent would object (or timeliness grounds or otherwise) if Claimants were to withdraw their current claims and resubmit similar claims on Exmingua's behalf under Article 10.16.1(b), Respondent stated that it would not be prepared to waive such potential objections. Tr-E, 16 December, 2019 Hearing, p. 170:15-17.\n\nA. *Loss claimed by Claimants in this arbitration*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nRespondent states that Claimants seek improperly through this arbitration to recover losses suffered by Exmingua.\n\n59.\n\nAccording to Respondent, nowhere in the Notice of Intent or the Notice of Arbitration do Claimants allege or seek to recover for any purported loss in the value of their interest in Exmingua, their shares, or any other type of reflective losses. Similarly, nowhere do Claimants plead the impact that this direct injury to Exmingua\u2019s projects and assets (for the values expressly indicated in the Notices) had on the value of Claimants\u2019 investment in Guatemala, that is, their interest in Exmingua. Respondent submits that tribunals have rightly dismissed cases in which, as here, a claimant confuses damages over its property and damages over the property of the company where the claimant owns shares, citing *Orascom TMT Investments S\u00e0rl v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*.39\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 23.\n\n60.\n\nRespondent contends that Claimants are attempting, in response to Guatemala\u2019s Preliminary Objections, to recharacterize the damages they claimed as reflective losses, but that this belated amendment of their claims cannot be allowed. This would violate Respondent\u2019s due process rights, the integrity of the proceedings and the DR-CAFTA structure. It would also defeat the policies adopted in DR-CAFTA for early disclosure of claims, the efficient resolution of disputes and the ability to address preliminary objections.\n\n61.\n\nFurthermore, Respondent contends that discounting debt to calculate reflective loss still would not permit one to equate a shareholder\u2019s recovery for reflective loss with the losses suffered by its local enterprise. None of the sources upon which Claimants seek to rely support this proposition. In the passage Claimants quote from Professor Kantor\u2019s book *Valuation for Arbitration,* he simply acknowledges that to calculate reflective loss, the debt of the enterprise should be discounted.40 The same can be said about the *Hochtief* and *Nykomb* decisions. In any event, Respondent agrees this is not the stage to quantify or prove Claimants\u2019 damages.41\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 25 (citing M. Kantor, *Valuation for Arbitration* 197 (Wolters Kluwer 2008)).\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 25-26 (citing *Hochtief AG v. Republic of Argentina*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Award, 21 December 2016, \u00b6 84, CL-0067-ENG/SPA; and *Nykomb Synergetics Technology Holding AB v. Republic of Latvia*, SCC Case, Award, 16 December 2003 (hereinafter \"*Nykomb*\"), p. 39, CL-0073- ENG).\n\nB. *Article 10.16.1(a)\u2019s and Article 10.16.1(b)\u2019s scope of protection*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nRespondent submits that, even if Claimants were allowed to recast their damages claims at this stage, Claimants\u2019 claims still would fail because they cannot recover for reflective loss under Article 10.16.1(a) of DR-CAFTA.\n\n63.\n\nAccording to Respondent, a shareholder proceeding under Article 10.16.1(a) may recover only for its direct injury. This provision requires a shareholder to show that such \"claimant has incurred loss.\"42 As noted by the ICJ in the *Barcelona Traction* case and reiterated in the *Diallo* case, such direct injury results from violations to their rights as shareholders, which typically include \"the right to any declared dividend, the right to attend and vote at general meetings, [and] the right to share in the residual assets of the company on liquidation.\"43\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 42.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 42 (citing the *Case Concerning Barcelona Traction, Light, and Power Co., Ltd (Belgium v. Spain)*, Judgment, 5 February 1970, 1970 I.C.J. Rep. 3 (hereinafter \"*Barcelona Traction*\"), \u00b6 47, RL-0006-027) and Respondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 36 (citing *Barcelona Traction* and *Ahmadou Sadio Diallo (Republic of Guinea v.

Rep. 582 \u00b6 88 (CL-0060- ENG) (hereinafter \"*Diallo*\").\n\n64.\n\nRespondent argues that the key difference between Article 10.16.1(a) and Article 10.16.1(b) is the type of loss or damage available to a claimant under the section of the article invoked. While section (a) of Article 10.16.1 allows a claimant to recover the direct injury it sustained, section (b) is the avenue required if a claimant seeks to recover, on behalf of a local enterprise, the damage that enterprise sustained. Article 10.16.1 determines the relief available under each subsection. If a claimant\u2019s injury is only indirect *(i.e.,* its shares lost value as a result of injury to the local company), that claimant must bring a claim under Article 10.16.1(b) on behalf of the enterprise which sustained the injury. The distinction is ultimately based on the right that allegedly has been infringed.44\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 46; *see also* Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, p. 166:4-16.\n\n65.\n\nRespondent explains that Article 10.16.1 uses the word \"may\" rather than \"shall\" because the investor has no *obligation* to file for arbitration (simply a right to do at its option) when it considers that it has suffered damages as a result of a Treaty breach. But if damages have been sustained by a local enterprise rather than directly by the investor itself, the only avenue to arbitration is under Article 10.16.1(b).45\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 167:21-168:12.\n\n66.\n\nAccording to Respondent, the analogy Claimants seek to draw between DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1 and ICSID Convention Article 25(2)(b) is misconceived. Article 25(2)(b) provides the Centre with jurisdiction to resolve a dispute presented by a claimant that is a local company, on the basis of the nationality of that company's controlling shareholder, but it does not necessarily address reflective loss claims (*i.e.,* how the controlling shareholder may proceed with respect to losses suffered by the company in which it holds shares). DR-CAFTA, by contrast, does regulate when and how a controlling shareholder may bring suit for losses sustained by a local enterprise, but it does so subject to very specific requirements.46\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 168:13-170:8.\n\n67.\n\nRespondent asserts that this distinction is not a mere formality. It contends that DR-CAFTA uses this distinction to avoid the negative consequences of reflective loss, such as the potential risks of double recovery and multiple proceedings, and to respect the separate legal personality of a company from that of its shareholders.47 That is why most advanced corporate law systems, including that of Guatemala, bar claims for reflective loss. Investment law organizations, contracting States, scholars and tribunals in cases such as *GAMI, Nykomb, Orascom* and *El Paso* have also identified the numerous undesirable consequences resulting from reflective loss claims.48\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 35; *see also* Respondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 38, 56.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 36-49 (citing *Gami Investments, Inc. v.

For instance, Respondent characterizes a Rule 41(5) ruling in *Eskosol* as holding that reflective loss claims were admissible, but doing so only after acknowledging that the ECT offers no avenue to address the policy concerns raised by reflective loss claims. Respondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 53 (citing *Eskosol S.p.A. in Liquidazione v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Decision on Respondent's Application Under Rule 41(5), 20 March 2017 (hereinafter \"*Eskosol*\"), \u00b6 170, CL-0058-ENG).\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 54.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 57.\n\n69.\n\nRespondent stresses the fact that DR-CAFTA, unlike older treaties, is a modern instrument that has put in place a mechanism in Article 10.16.1 specifically designed to address this issue. This mechanism, which scholars have labeled as unique,52 was first devised by the U.S. and introduced in NAFTA in the form of Articles 1116 and 1117, and later enhanced in the context of DR-CAFTA. The Tribunal must, accordingly, decide this case based on the specific regime of DR-CAFTA (*lex specialis*), and not rely on the cases Claimants invoke which concern the interpretation of older treaties.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 61-64.\n\n70.\n\nImportantly, the NAFTA Contracting Parties agree that Article 1116, which Respondent asserts is substantially the same as Article 10.16.1(a) of DR-CAFTA, does not allow a shareholder to recover reflective loss. That is the position that the United States has consistently taken in *Pope & Talbot, GAMI,* and *Clayton53* In the *Clayton* case, for instance, the United States stated in unambiguous terms that the only route for shareholder claims is that of Article 1116 and that \"[m]inority shareholders who do not own or control the enterprise may not bring a claim for loss or damage under Article 1117, thereby reducing the risk of multiple actions with respect to the same 4 disputed measures.\"54 Respondent contends that Canada's and Mexico's positions are the same.55\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 66-68 (citing *Pope & Talbot Inc. v.

The full paragraph of the US submission reads: \"Article 1117(1) addresses this issue by creating a right to present a claim not found in customary international law. Where the investment is an enterprise of another Party, an investor of a Party that owns or controls the enterprise may submit a claim on behalf of the enterprise for loss or damage incurred by the enterprise. However, minority shareholders who do not own or control the enterprise may not bring a claim for loss or damage under Article 1117, thereby reducing the risk of multiple actions with respect to the same disputed measures.\"\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 69; *see also* Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 154:9-155:6.\n\n71.\n\nMoreover, Respondent stresses that no NAFTA tribunal that has considered the distinction between Articles 1116 and 1117 has ever awarded damages for reflective loss under Article 1116. Neither *Mondev, Pope & Talbot, GAMI* nor *Clayton* awarded damages for reflective loss.56 The limited damages the *Clayton* tribunal awarded were not meant to compensate reflective losses; that tribunal discussed this issue explicitly and concluded that the damages it would award were not reflective in nature.57 Nor did the *UPS* tribunal award damages for reflective loss.58\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 74-77, and 80 (citing *Mondev International Ltd. v.

Republic of Guatemala*, ICSID Case No. ARB/10/23, Award, 19 December 2013 (hereinafter \"*TECO*\") \u00b6438, CL-0031-ENG/SPA; *Railroad Development Corp. v.

The reasons in any case for raising some objections but not others may be for efficiency, an intentional allocation of resources, or to focus on other arguments. Second, TECO already had agreed to sell its interest in the local company, EEGSA, at the time the arbitration was initiated, and the sale of EEGSA closed the day after the arbitration was brought. Further, TECO did not control EEGSA because it was a minority shareholder, and as such \"could not have brought a claim under Article 10.16(1)(b) of the DR-CAFTA.\"60 Nor was there any parallel ongoing litigation in the local courts, unlike the situation here.61\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 86-88; Respondent's Rebuttal Argument Presentation, 16 December 2019 Hearing, p. 4.\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, p. 158:9-14.\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that *RDC,* the other case Claimants cite, is also significantly different from the present case. First, RDC brought claims both on its own behalf and on behalf of its local enterprise, FVG. Second, RDC filed waivers signed by both itself and FVG. Third, in RDC, \"the local enterprise\u2019s minority shareholders were not Guatemalan nationals, an issue that is absent in the present case.\" Fourth, despite bringing claims on behalf of its local enterprise, RDC requested the award be payable directly to itself, and Guatemala objected to RDC\u2019s request because this would violate Article 10.26.2 of DR-CAFTA, which requires monetary compensation for claims on behalf of a local enterprise to be paid to the enterprise itself. Fifth, and most important, in *RDC* the tribunal awarded damages to the claimant rather than the enterprise only on the proviso that all the claimant\u2019s shares in the local enterprise were transferred to Guatemala.62\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 89; *see also* Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, p. 164:8-165:19.\n\nE. *Consequences of allowing reflective loss claims under Article 10.16.1(a)*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nRespondent submits that if claims for reflective loss were allowed under Article 10.16.1(a), the requirements imposed on bringing derivative claims under Article 10.16.1(b) would be easily circumvented and would become essentially meaningless.\n\n76.\n\nAccording to Respondent, any such result would contravene the interpretative principles of Article 31.1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (\"**VCLT**\").63 The object and purpose of the derivative claims mechanism under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b) is to avoid the problems associated with reflective loss claims. Therefore, the Treaty provides for strict requirements in order to bring a claim on behalf of a local company and to seek to recover that company\u2019s direct loss. These requirements are that (i) any requested monetary compensation is to be paid to the enterprise (Article 10.26 of DR-CAFTA); (ii) any right to initiate or continue any local litigation in the host State with respect to any measure alleged to constitute a breach in the arbitration must be waived (Article 10.18.2 of DR-CAFTA); and (iii) any claims for breach of protections already litigated in the host State are foreclosed (Annex 10-E of DR-CAFTA).64 Here, Claimants have complied with none of these requirements.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 90 *et seq*.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 93.\n\n77.\n\n*First,* Claimants request compensation be paid to themselves directly under Article 10.16.1(a) of DR-CAFTA, even though (Respondent asserts) they are measuring compensation by reference to Exmingua\u2019s losses. If this is condoned, it could prevent any creditors of Exmingua from enforcing any rights they may have over the assets of the enterprise, including an arbitral award. As explained by the *Renco* tribunal on the basis of an almost identical provision, such interpretation would render this mechanism \"ineffective, contrary to the customary international law principle of effectiveness.\"65 Claimants effectively would have circumvented the safeguard built into Article 10.26.2 of DR-CAFTA to protect creditors of a local enterprise.66\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 61 (quoting *The Renco Group, Inc. v. Republic of Peru*, Case No. UNCT/13/1, Second Submission of the United States of America, 1 September 2015, (hereinafter \"*Renco, Second Submission by the US*\") fn. 14, RL-0005-005).\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 97-104.\n\n78.\n\n*Second,* Claimants also have failed to submit the waiver required by DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.2(b)(ii).67 This provision requires a shareholder who seeks to recover its enterprise\u2019s losses to: (i) submit an enterprise\u2019s written waiver of \"any\" right to initiate or continue \"any\" local proceeding, monetary or not, with respect to \"any\" measure alleged to constitute a breach in the Arbitration; and (ii) withdraw from any corresponding local proceedings.68 The purpose of this provision, which is an element of Respondent\u2019s consent, is to avoid double recovery, multiplicity of proceedings, contradictory findings from different tribunals and legal uncertainty.69 This is a jurisdictional requirement and cannot be remedied by allowing Claimants to expand or amend the waiver on file.70\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 105-109.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 64-67.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 65.\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 170:18-171:5.\n\n79.\n\nIn this case, the key measure that is alleged to amount to a Treaty breach, namely the suspension of Exmingua\u2019s exploitation license for the Progreso VII Project in 2015, is the object of local, ongoing, proceedings. If Claimants succeed in this arbitration, they will obtain compensation for Exmingua\u2019s inability to exploit its mine over the past several years, while Exmingua still might have its exploitation license reinstated by the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, continuing to be effective for another 25 years. That is exactly the type of situation that the waiver requirement seeks to prevent.\n\n80.\n\n*Lastly,* had Claimants initiated this Arbitration on behalf of Exmingua under Article 10.16.1(b) of DR-CAFTA, they would be precluded from bringing their full protection and security claim again in this Arbitration under Annex 10-E of DR-CAFTA.71 Under Annex 10-E of DR-CAFTA, a U.S. investor cannot submit to arbitration a claim for breach of an obligation under the Treaty on behalf of an enterprise if the enterprise \"has alleged that breach of an obligation\" in proceedings before a local court. Claimants should not be allowed to circumvent the \"Fork-in-the-Road\" provision by disguising their claims as claims made on their own behalf under Article 10.16.1(a) of DR-CAFTA.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 110-117.\n\n**b. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n81.\n\nClaimants assert that their claims were properly submitted to arbitration under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a). They invoke the ordinary meaning and the object and purpose of Article 10.16.1(a). They assert that they have submitted claims for losses suffered by *themselves* as a result of Guatemala\u2019s actions and have therefore complied with the waiver requirement. They also claim that the DR-CAFTA Annex 10-E is inapplicable to their claims.72\n\nSee, generally, Claimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 10-81 and Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 9-90.\n\nA. *Article 10.16.1(a)\u2019s ordinary meaning and context*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Article 10.16.1(a)\u2019s ordinary meaning, in context, allows Claimants to make claims on their own behalf for the loss in value of their direct and indirect interest in Exmingua, suffered as a result of measures taken by Respondent against Exmingua.\n\n83.\n\n*First,* Claimants point out that the text of DR-CAFTA Articles 10.16.1(a) and (b) do not contain any limiting or restrictive language. To the contrary, the ordinary meaning of the words confirms that a claimant \"may\" submit a claim to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a) when the claimant has incurred loss or damage arising out of that breach. This language is clearly \"permissive, not mandatory,\" as the tribunal in *Pope & Talbot* found with respect to the corresponding language in NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117.73 Had the DR-CAFTA Parties wanted to require claimants who owned or controlled an enterprise to bring claims only on behalf of that enterprise, they easily could have (and should have) done so, particularly in view of the then already existing long line of cases interpreting similar provisions as allowing reflective loss claims.74\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 21 (quoting *Pope & Talbot*, *Award*, \u00b6 79).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 78; *see also* Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 92:22-93:10.\n\n84.\n\nIn accordance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT, a good faith interpretation must take into account the consequences that the State Parties must \"reasonably and legitimately be considered to have envisaged as flowing from their undertakings.\"75 Accordingly, tribunals have rejected attempts to read limiting or qualifying terms into the language of otherwise broad treaty provisions. For example, the tribunals in cases such as *Siemens* and *Waste Management II* both refused to restrict coverage of investment treaties to \"direct\" investments, and to dismiss indirect investment claims, where the definition of \"investment\" contained no such qualifying language.76 Furthermore, the words \"by reason of, or arising out of that breach\" immediately following the phrase \"loss or damage\" further support its broad meaning. Respondent, Claimants say, offers no response.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 16 (quoting J. Romesh Weeramantry, *Treaty Interpretation in Investment Arbitration* 47-48 (OUP 2012),CL-0007-ENG).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 (referring to *Siemens A.G. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, \u00b6 137, CL-0018-ENG/SPA; *Waste Management Inc. v. United Mexican States (II)*, ICSID Case No. ARB/AF/00/03, Award, 30 April 2004, \u00b6 85, CL-0022-ENG/SPA).\n\n85.\n\nClaimants further submit that the inclusion of \"shares\" in the definition of \"investment\" does no more than confirm that Claimants\u2019 claim is admissible. To the extent that a qualifying claimant holds shares in a protected enterprise, that claimant will have made an investment within the meaning of the Treaty and will be entitled to bring a claim for damage that it has suffered as a result of a breach of the Treaty. As the annulment committee in *Azurix* reasoned, whether such damage is indirect or direct is irrelevant.77\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 40 (referring to *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Decision on the Application for Annulment of the Argentine Republic, 1 September 2009 (hereinafter \"*Azurix, Annulment Decision*\") \u00b6\u00b6 105, 108, CL-0051-ENG/SPA) and Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 14.\n\n86.\n\n*Second,* Claimants assert that Respondent\u2019s own prior state practice shows that claims for reflective loss are admissible under the DR-CAFTA. In *TECO,* TECO brought a claim for so-called reflective loss under Article 10.16.1(a) and Guatemala did not raise any objection in this regard.78 In Claimants\u2019 view, the fact that TECO was a minority shareholder and could not have submitted a claim pursuant to Article 10.16.1(b) does not make any difference. Allowing a minority shareholder to file a claim for reflective loss under Article 10.16.1(a), but requiring a majority or controlling shareholder to file that same claim under Article 10.16.1(b), makes no sense if the correct interpretation of DR-CAFTA, as Guatemala suggests, is that no indirect loss claims are permitted other than under Article 10.16.1(b).79\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 26-29; *see also* Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 196:12-199:22.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 15-18, 21; *see also* Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 195:15-196:15.\n\n87.\n\nSimilarly, Claimants allege that the tribunal in *RDC* also made an award for reflective loss. Although initially the claimant brought its claim under both Article 10.16.1(a) and (b), the award was paid, at Guatemala\u2019s urging, to the claimant - and not to its enterprise - which shows that it was made pursuant to Article 10.16.1(a).80 Claimants argue that Respondent offers no explanation other than mere speculation as to its own motivations concerning this past and consistent practice.81 In Claimants\u2019 view, this is not inconsequential for this Tribunal\u2019s task of interpreting Article 10.16.1. In *Oil Platforms,* for instance, the ICJ rejected Iran\u2019s novel interpretation of a provision in the underlying Treaty, observing that the interpretation was inconsistent with the parties\u2019 practice in their prior pleadings before the ICJ in earlier cases based on the same treaty.82\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 16.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 19-20 (citing *Oil Platforms* (*Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America*), Preliminary Objection, Judgment, 12 Dec. 1996, 1996 I.C.J. Rep. 803, (hereinafter \"*Oil Platforms*\") at 812 \u00b6 24, CL-0103-ENG.).\n\n88.\n\n*Third*, Claimants state that NAFTA jurisprudence confirms the right of shareholders to bring claims on their own behalf for reflective loss. NAFTA tribunals have rejected respondent States' objections that claimants may not recover for reflective loss under NAFTA Article 1116, or that majority shareholders may only recover for reflective loss indirectly under Article 1117. Examples in Claimants' view include *Mondev, GAMI, Pope & Talbot, UPS,* and *S.D. Myers.83* That some of those particular claimants may not have prevailed on the merits of their cases is irrelevant; what matters, according to Claimants, is that none of those tribunals dismissed claims or refused to award damages on account of the claims being for reflective loss.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 24, 30-31.\n\n89.\n\nClaimants consider it telling that Respondent supports its discussions of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117 by references to scholarly work and to the NAFTA Parties' submissions in various cases, but not to any tribunal decisions. Scholarly views cannot alter the meaning of the NAFTA's text, and tribunals have declined to adopt the interpretations proposed in the various NAFTA Party submissions Respondent cites, neither dismissing for lack of jurisdiction nor finding Article 1116 claims to be inadmissible. Had the NAFTA Parties wished to exclude reflective loss claim from Article 1116, they could have issued an official interpretation through the NAFTA Free Trade Commission (FTC), but they did not do so.84 Furthermore, the NAFTA Parties in any event are not coextensive with the DR-CAFTA Parties.\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 191:9-194:3.\n\n90.\n\nClaimants reject Respondent's contention that allowing claims for reflective loss under NAFTA Article 1116 (or DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a)) would render the mechanism under NAFTA Article 1117 (or DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b)) meaningless. NAFTA Article 1117 and DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b) provide an *additional* option for an investor that owns or controls an enterprise to bring a claim. This option provides for different and broader coverage than Article 1116 and DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a), including the ability for the local company to seek recovery for its *entire* injury, which may be much higher than the reflective loss portion traceable up through the shares of the controlling investor. There may be other good reasons for a shareholder claimant to make a claim under NAFTA Article 1117 or DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b), for example having to do with lower tax rates in certain countries or a desire to reinvest the proceeds of an award in the host state, without having to convert and repatriate the funds if they were first paid to the shareholder under NAFTA Article 1116 or DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a). Another reason could be to avoid the uncertainties of having to prove that the damages sustained by the local enterprise truly flowed up to the shareholders, which is generally an additional hurdle to proving reflective loss claims.85 It is thus by no means clear that a shareholder who has both procedural options will always choose NAFTA Article 1116 (or DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a)) over NAFTA Article 1117 (or DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b)).\n\nSee the discussion at Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 100:5-104:3.\n\nB. *Article 10.16.1(a)\u2019s object and purpose*\n--------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nClaimants maintain that admitting claims for reflective loss is also consistent with the DR-CAFTA's object and purpose of providing effective means of dispute settlement.86\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 34-60.\n\n92.\n\n*First,* they contend that their interpretation is in line with DR-CAFTA's object and purpose of providing effective means of dispute settlement. Respondent's interpretation, by contrast, would deprive shareholder investors of any opportunity to seek investor-State arbitration for the most commonly suffered damages, and would provide considerably less protection to foreign investors than any of the multitude of modern investment treaties. Unsurprisingly, tribunals interpreting Argentina's investment treaties all have dismissed similar objections and found that claimants may bring claims for reflective loss.87 The same is true under various other investment treaties.88 Claimants note that Respondent has not, in fact, identified a single case under any modern investment treaty where a tribunal has found that an investor lacked standing to bring a claim for reflective loss as a result of a respondent State's alleged breach of the treaty. In Claimants' view, Respondent's reliance instead on the customary international law of diplomatic protection and in particular on the ICJ\u2019s judgments in the *Barcelona Traction* and *Diallo* cases, ignores that the DR-CAFTA derogates from customary international law by providing shareholders the right to recover for losses suffered as a result of actions taken against the enterprise in which they invested.89 This was made clear in the ICJ\u2019s Judgment on Preliminary Objections in the *Diallo* case.\n\nSee the cases referenced in Claimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 38, ft. 72 and in \u00b6\u00b6 39-40.\n\nSee the cases referenced in Claimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 41, ft. 78.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 44-47 and Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 36.\n\n93.\n\nAccording to Claimants, Respondent\u2019s contention that most \"advanced\" national legal systems bar claims for reflective loss is inapposite. None of the domestic laws that Respondent quotes is applicable in this proceeding, which is governed by the DR-CAFTA and international law. National laws cannot override the Treaty. Claimants likewise reject Respondent\u2019s argument that claims for reflective loss were often permitted in disputes involving \"older\" treaties because they provided the only meaningful avenue for shareholders to recover.\n\n94.\n\nClaimants remark that many of the treaties Respondent cites include certain local enterprises in the definition of an \"investor,\" while others allow certain local companies to be treated as a national of the other Contracting Party in accordance with Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.90 In their view, the ICSID Article 25(2)(b) mechanism serves a purpose similar to DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b), insofar as it provides a means for an enterprise of the host State to recover its losses suffered as a result of host State\u2019s measures aimed at that enterprise. If the existence of DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b) meant that a claimant who owns or controls an enterprise *must* bring a claim for any loss pursuant to that Article and on behalf of the enterprise itself, as Respondent suggests, then it would stand to reason that in ICSID cases where the Parties had agreed to treat foreign-controlled local companies as non-nationals of the respondent State, claimants likewise would be limited to causing such local companies to file claims in their own names pursuant to Article 25(2)(b). Arbitral tribunals however have properly rejected that proposition; Claimants refer to the annulment decision in *Azurix* and the decisions in *Cube Infrastructure* and *Sempra*91\n\n*See also* Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, p. 210:6:20.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 46-49 (citing *Azurix, Annulment Decision*, \u00b6\u00b6 102, 127; *Cube Infrastructure Fund SICAV and others v. Kingdom of Spain*, ICISD Case No. ARB/15/20, Decision on Jurisdiction, Liability and Partial Decision on Quantum, 19 February 2019, \u00b6 174, CL-0059-ENG; *Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 11 May 2005 (hereinafter \"*Sempra, Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction*\") \u00b6\u00b6 42, 45, CL-0072-ENG/SPA). Claimants likewise reject Respondent's invocation of *Eskosol,* which in their view addressed a different issue, namely whether the local company was precluded from bringing a claim in its own name after its majority shareholder had brought a separate claim for reflective loss. Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 50.\n\n95.\n\nClaimants also contend that, none of the perceived negative consequences Respondent invokes, such as the prospect of multiple proceedings and/or double recovery or double payment, can affect Claimants\u2019 standing or the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. They emphasize that tribunals have various means at their disposal to address such concerns, including by fashioning awards so as to prevent double recovery or double payment. Importantly, the *Renco* award, on which Respondent relies, did not rule on Peru\u2019s objection to the admissibility of reflective loss claims, but rather dismissed the claim for lack of jurisdiction on account of a defective waiver.92\n\nTr-E, December 16, 2019 Hearing, p. 200:1-22.\n\n96.\n\n*Second,* Claimants assert that shareholders bringing claims for reflective loss on their own behalf do not recover at the expense of creditors, and in any event, Respondent has not demonstrated that Articles 10.16.1(a) and (b) must be interpreted in a manner that is most protective of creditors. Article 10.26.2(c) does not support that contention, nor does it shed any light on whether a claimant may make a claim for reflective loss under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a). It merely recognizes that an award under DR-CAFTA does not and cannot affect rights to the proceeds of that award that others may have under domestic law. Similarly, DR-CAFTA Article 10.26.2 merely provides that where a claim is filed on behalf of an enterprise under Article 10.16.1(b), then naturally the award ought to be paid to the enterprise, as it is compensating the enterprise for its losses.\n\n97.\n\nClaimants further submit that Respondent\u2019s arguments are based on a misunderstanding of basic damages calculation with respect to reflective loss claims. It is only after an enterprise\u2019s debt has been satisfied that there would be any value assigned to shareholders, and therefore a shareholder\u2019s recovery will be the same whether it recovers that amount directly (pursuant to a reflective loss claim under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a)) or indirectly after the enterprise recovers the full amount of its loss (pursuant to a claim under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b)), pays off its creditors, and distributes the remaining equity value to its shareholders. On the other hand, the respondent State\u2019s liability may well be *greater* where a majority shareholder files a claim on behalf of the enterprise under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(b)), because the liability in that scenario extends to the enterprise\u2019s full losses, not only to the portion attributable to a particular upstream shareholder after accounting for priority debt. Indeed, Claimants argue that Respondent itself recognized this possibility in *RDC v. Guatemala,* where it objected to the tribunal\u2019s awarding damages to the local enterprise on the grounds that this would result in compensation to minority shareholders who did not themselves have any treaty rights.93\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 53, 59.\n\nC. *Loss recovery under Article 10.16.1(a)*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nClaimants state that they have submitted claims for losses that they themselves suffered. Specifically, Claimants state that they seek damages for the diminution in the value of their shares in Exmingua as a result of the measures taken by Guatemala in breach of DR-CAFTA.\n\n99.\n\nIn Claimants\u2019 view, the fact that they did not use the term \"reflective\" to describe their losses in their Notice of Intent and Notice of Arbitration is completely irrelevant. The DR-CAFTA does not require that a notice of arbitration further specify the relief requested. There is no requirement that Claimants expressly characterize their damages in their Notice of Arbitration as \"direct,\" \"indirect\" or \"reflective,\" as Respondent suggests. This is confirmed in arbitral practice as the *TECO* and *Khan* decisions show.94\n\nClaimants' PO Rejoinder. \u00b6\u00b6 71-72 (referring to *TECO,* \u00b6 742; *Khan Resources Inc., Khan Resources B.V., and Cauc Hldg. Co. Ltd. v. The Government of Mongolia*, UNCITRAL, Award on the Merits, 2 March 2015 (hereinafter \"*Khan*\") \u00b6 77(2),CL-0114-ENG).\n\n100.\n\nClaimants also accuse Respondent of ignoring each and every reference in the Notice of Intent and Notice of Arbitration to Claimants\u2019 loss or damage suffered as a result of Respondent\u2019s actions, and of focusing exclusively on the fact that the measures at issue were targeted at Exmingua, which also incurred damage as a result of Respondent\u2019s alleged Treaty breaches. Claimants contend that there is nothing out of the ordinary in such references to the local target of State action, which do not prevent shareholders from pursuing recovery of their own separately cognizable losses.\n\n101.\n\nClaimants further contend that none of the jurisprudence Respondent cites supports a contrary conclusion. The *OTMTI* award, upon which Respondent relies, is different from this case, which does not involve multiple proceedings or a prospect of former Exmingua shareholders bringing a claim challenging the same measures.95 Respondent\u2019s reliance on *LESI-Dipenta* is also misplaced, Claimants say, because unlike in that case - where the claimant did not own the investment and the tribunal thus found no jurisdiction - here, Mr. Kappes and KCA hold shares in Exmingua, and those shares qualify as investments under the Treaty.96 Nor does *Nykomb* assist Respondent, Claimants argue. In that case, the claimant sought to recover damages equal to its subsidiary\u2019s alleged loss of income and the tribunal rejected that deficient calculation, but here, Claimants have not yet set out their quantification of their losses.97\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 64-65 (discussing *Orascom* \u00b6\u00b6 488-489, \u00b6\u00b6 496-498, 539-545.).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 66 (discussing *L.E.S.I. S.p.A. and ASTALDI S.p.A. v. People's Democratic Republic of Algeria*, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, 12 July 2006, at 33, CL-0112-FR/ENG).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 67 (discussing *Nykomb* (n 40) at 3-5, 39 (CL-0073-ENG).\n\n102.\n\nClaimants also reject Respondent\u2019s invocation of *Clayton.* They say that despite misinterpreting NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117, the *Clayton* tribunal still rejected Canada\u2019s objection that the claimants only recourse would have been to file a claim on behalf of their wholly-owned enterprise pursuant to NAFTA Article 1117.98 The tribunal explained that the claimants, and not only the Canadian enterprise in which they held shares and which was denied a permit, had suffered losses as a result of Canada's breach. This was so because the opportunity to develop the project was that of the claimants, who had invested in the opportunity. The same is true here, Claimants say, where the sole purpose of Exmingua was to build and operate the Tambor mining project. Moreover, Claimants' investment in Exmingua has been rendered useless as a result of Respondent's actions and omissions. In such circumstances, they assert, there can be no doubt that they have suffered a \"direct\" injury and may make a claim on their own behalf.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 58-60 and Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 32-33 (citing *Clayton, Award on Damages, \u00b6* 396); *see also* Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 202:2-205:22 (Claimants' counsel stating that one cannot, as the *Clayton* tribunal did, \"say that an interpretation renders a provision meaningless or inutile, it needs to do so in all circumstances, not just in the particular circumstances in front of you\").\n\n103.\n\nIn any event, Claimants say that they have *alleged* that they themselves suffered damages as a result of Respondent's Treaty breaches, and the Tribunal should accept that allegation as true for purposes of determining Respondent's Article 10.20.5 preliminary objections, pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.20(4)(c). Contrary to Respondent's assertions, Claimants are not attempting to \"amend\" or \"re-characterize\" their claims or to \"reengineer\" their Notices. Be that as it may, the issue of existence of loss is one for the merits, they argue, citing decisions in the *Glamis Gold* and *UPS* cases.99\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 63 (*Glamis Gold Ltd. v. United States of Americ* a, UNCITRAL, Procedural Order No. 2 (revised) 31 May 2005 \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, CL-0071-ENG; *UPS* \u00b6 37; see also *Pope & Talbot, Award* \u00b6 80).\n\nD. *Waiver requirement under Article 10.18.2(b)*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nClaimants state that they have complied with the applicable DR-CAFTA waiver requirement. They make three major arguments.\n\n105.\n\n*First,* Claimants note that they submitted their claims pursuant to Article 10.16.1(a) and, consequently, in accordance with the ordinary meaning of Article 10.18.2(b)(i), were required to submit a waiver on behalf of themselves and not on behalf of Exmingua. Therefore, Respondent's reliance on *Commerce Group* is misplaced. Here, Claimants have not acted contrary to the waiver that *they* provided, nor are Claimants themselves parties to any proceedings before a Guatemalan court or administrative tribunal.100 If the Tribunal decides that Claimants are permitted to bring claims under Article 10.16.1(a), then Respondent\u2019s arguments regarding the need for an enterprise\u2019s waiver are moot.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 67.\n\n106.\n\nIn respect of the Guatemala court proceedings to which Exmingua is a party, Claimants consider that the Constitutional Court has no intention of ruling on that matter. It should have done so in five days, they say, and it already has been three-and-a-half years. The only reason why Exmingua has not formally withdrawn those proceedings is to avoid an accusation in this case that Claimants have failed any requirement to exhaust local remedies.101\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 105:2-12.\n\n107.\n\n*Second,* Claimants point out that while NAFTA requires a claimant making a claim on its own behalf to file a waiver on behalf of an enterprise in certain circumstances, DR-CAFTA contains no corresponding language, and there is no basis to insert additional waiver requirements into the Treaty. Accordingly, Respondent\u2019s assertion that Claimants\u2019 claims are \"exactly the type of outcome the DR-CAFTA\u2019s derivative claim mechanism seeks to prevent\" is unsupported and belied by the plain text of the Treaty.102\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 78 (citing Respondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 107).\n\n108.\n\nClaimants also contend that it would defy VCLT treaty interpretation principles to construe the absence of an enterprise waiver requirement for Article 10.16.1(a) claims as proof that the DR-CAFTA Parties wished to prohibit claims for reflective loss claims under that Article, and intended to require any claims for losses suffered by a claimant as a result of measures aimed at a local enterprise to be brought under Article 10.16.1(b) and accompanied by an enterprise waiver. If the State Parties had so intended, Claimants argue, they could have inserted text in Article 10.18.2 to that effect, but did not do so.\n\n109.\n\n*Finally,* Claimants assert that the perceived advantages of an enterprise waiver - such as preventing double recovery, multiple proceedings or inconsistent decisions - cannot override the plain language of the Treaty. Moreover, these advantages could not necessarily be secured even where a local enterprise waiver is provided. In any event, Claimants argue, to the extent that double recovery or double payment is a concern, tribunals have other means at their disposal to guard against such risks. Moreover, numerous tribunals have confirmed that these concerns are irrelevant to a tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction. With regard to the multiplicity of claims and the possibility of inconsistent decisions, as Professor Schreuer explains, \"[a]ny difficulties arising from a multiplicity of claimants can be taken care of by a number of devices but do not require that the investor be deprived of its standing.\"103\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 71 (quoting Christoph Schreuer, Shareholder Protection in International Investment Law, in Pierre-Marie Dupuy et al. eds*, Common Values in International Law: Essays in Honour of Christian Tomuschat* 612 (2006), CL-0076-ENG.).\n\nE. *DR-CAFTA Annex 10-E*\n------------------------\n\n110.\n\nClaimants contest the applicability of DR-CAFTA Annex 10-E to this case. They refer, in particular, to the ordinary meaning of Annex 10-E and Article 10.18.2(b), and the object and purpose of DR-CAFTA.\n\n111.\n\nClaimants explain that DR-CAFTA does not contain a fork-in-the-road provision, but, rather, has a \"no-u-turn\" provision, which allows claimants to first pursue local court remedies before commencing arbitration.104 Annex 10-E establishes a limited exception to the no-u-turn rule for U.S. investors, but such exception is inapposite here.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 74.\n\n112.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the plain language of Annex 10-E makes it clear that it applies to local proceedings where a *\"breach of an obligation under Section A*\" of Chapter 10 of the DR-CAFTA is alleged. It does not apply to local actions alleging only infringement of local laws. Respondent\u2019s contention to the contrary moreover would make the provision inconsistent with the waiver provision in Article 10.18.2(b), which presupposes that a claimant or an enterprise, as the case may be, may have initiated local court proceedings challenging the same measure at issue in the arbitration. If doing so constituted a preclusive election of local remedies over a potential DR-CAFTA remedy, then there would be no purpose in requiring a waiver of the right to continue court proceedings as a condition of commencing a DR-CAFTA case.\n\n113.\n\nClaimants submit that the purpose and object of Annex 10-E was instead to address the particular circumstance in some civil law countries that claims may be made in domestic court for a breach of the Treaty itself. This was made clear by the tribunal in *Corona,* a case that Respondent has chosen to ignore.105 Nor does Respondent address *Nissan,* where the tribunal interpreted a similar provision, and rejected the respondent\u2019s objection in that case because the claimant had not presented any claim for breach of the treaty before local courts.106\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 79 (citing *Corona Materials LLC v. Dominican Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/14/3, Award on the Respondent's Expedited Preliminary Objections in Accordance with Article 10.20.5 of the DR-CAFTA, 31 May 2016 (hereinafter \"*Corona*\") \u00b6 269, RL-0002-ENG); *see also* Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 87.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 87 and Claimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial n. 156 (quoting *Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. v. Republic of India*, PCA Case No. 2017-37, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2019 (hereinafter \"*Nissan\"*) \u00b6 214, CL-0078-ENG).\n\n114.\n\nHere, Claimants emphasize that they have not submitted any claims, much less DR-CAFTA claims, before the Guatemalan courts. Nor has Exmingua (Claimants\u2019 investment) brought any DR-CAFTA claim before the local courts. Exmingua\u2019s Guatemalan court proceedings have exclusively alleged violations of Guatemalan law.\n\n115.\n\nFinally, Claimants contend that Respondent\u2019s reliance on *H&H Enterprises* and *Pantechniki* does not support its position that the Tribunal should apply a \"fundamental basis\" test to determine if DR-CAFTA claims are barred by prior local court claims.107 These cases addressed typical fork-in-the-road clauses which preclude arbitration of claims when a claimant already has submitted the \"dispute\" to court; neither case involved a provision akin to Annex 10-E, which alludes instead to the prior filing of claims for Treaty breach. For the same reason, Claimants contend, decisions interpreting ordinary fork-in-the-road clauses are generally irrelevant to the interpretation of Annex 10-E.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 88.\n\n**c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\nA. *Preliminary Observations*\n-----------------------------\n\n116.\n\nWhile Respondent has presented three separate \"grounds for dismissal\" related to interpretation of DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a),108 these grounds in essence present a single, related question: whether the Treaty permits Claimants to proceed under that Article rather than under Article 10.16.1(b). The Tribunal here briefly explains why, in its view, the three grounds effectively collapse into this one central inquiry.\n\n*See* Respondent's chart reproduced in \u00b6 55 above, arguing that (a) as a matter of law, no award in Claimants' favor can be made, (b) the claims are inadmissible because Claimants do not have standing to proceed, and (c) the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claims absent a waiver by Exmingua.\n\n117.\n\nFirst, Respondent\u2019s initial ground for complaint is that, pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.4, the \"claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant may be made.\" The first step in any such analysis is a determination of *what claim in fact has been submitted*, since that is a predicate to assessing whether the Treaty would allow an award based on such a claim. The Tribunal accepts that under the DR-CAFTA preliminary objections framework, an objection pursuant to Article 20.4 must be resolved on the basis of the allegations Claimants made in the pleading by which the claim was \"submitted,\" which in this instance was Claimants\u2019 Notice of Arbitration.109 This proposition does not mean, however, that in the event of any ambiguity in that document as to what relief Claimants are seeking, the Tribunal must flatly reject any clarifications Claimants subsequently offer on that score. It would be nonsensical to decide a proposition about the legal cognizability of a \"claim submitted\" while ignoring Claimants\u2019 clarifications about what that claim actually is.\n\nArticle 10.20.4(a) also envisions the possibility of preliminary objections being made later in a proceeding, after a claimant submits an amendment to its prior notice of arbitration or even after a claimant submits its memorial. In such instances, determination of what claim has been \"submitted\" necessarily would involve interpretation of these subsequent pleadings.\n\n118.\n\nRespondent argues that, from the Notice of Arbitration, it appeared that Claimants were seeking to recover for their own account the losses allegedly suffered by Exmingua, rather than any losses they themselves suffered, whether directly or indirectly.110 Claimants contend otherwise, stating that they always intended to submit a claim for their own losses and not Exmingua\u2019s, but emphasized harm to Exmingua in their pleading because that is a relevant step in the causation chain for measuring their own losses.111 Having closely reviewed the Notice of Arbitration, the Tribunal accepts that there are sufficient references in that document to harm to Claimants\u2019 investment in Exmingua, and not simply harm to Exmingua itself, to support the clarification that Claimants subsequently provided.112 The same is true for Claimants\u2019 prior Notice of Intent.113 The Tribunal therefore does not consider Claimants\u2019 arguments in response to the Preliminary Objections to be a wholesale amendment of a clearly different prior claim, as Respondent suggests. Moreover, to the extent there was any ambiguity in the prior framing, Claimants now expressly accept that Exmingua\u2019s losses cannot simply be equated to their own losses. They acknowledge that the proof of their losses would require additional showings of causation as well as potentially more complex quantification, including accounting for any claims by Exmingua\u2019s creditors.114\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 5, 11(a), 47.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Claimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 56-57; Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 63.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Notice of Arbitration \u00b6\u00b6 21, 51, 64 (alleging that \"Claimants have incurred significant loss and damages by reason of, or arising out of, these breaches,\" that Guatemala's actions \"prevented the Claimants from reaping any benefits from their investments,\" and that \"Claimants have incurred significant losses as a result of these breaches\").\n\n*See, e.g.,* Notice of Intent at 2, 3 (alleging that \"the Investors have been deprived of the use and enjoyment of their investment in Exmingua, which has been subjected to a series of acts and omissions by the State \u2026,\" and that \"Mr. Kappes and KCA have incurred significant losses as a consequence of those breaches\").\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 49 (\"an investor's shares in an enterprise only have value to the extent that the enterprise has a positive value after having paid off its creditors \u2026. Thus, when calculating damage to a shareholder as a result of its reflective loss, one does not simply calculate the loss in cash flow to the enterprise and apply the claimant's percentage ownership to that amount. Rather, it is only after the enterprise's debt has been satisfied that there is any value to be assigned to shareholders.\"); Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 57.\n\n119.\n\nGiven this finding about the nature of the \"claim submitted,\" Respondent\u2019s first ground for dismissal cannot be resolved simply on a finding that Claimants are seeking the wrong relief *(i.e.,* a different entity\u2019s losses). Rather, it presents the central question of whether DR-CAFTA allows Claimants to proceed under Article 10.16.1(a) to recover their own losses, if those losses were sustained only *indirectly* (through decline or destruction of the value of their Exmingua shares, due to State action aimed at Exmingua), rather than *directly* (because of State action aimed at Claimants\u2019 shareholding itself). Respondent\u2019s core objection is that as a matter of law, Article 10.16.1(a) is available only for the latter, *i.e.,* for claims of \"direct damages.\"115 Otherwise stated, Respondent contends that any claims for harm *derived from* a local enterprise\u2019s losses must be brought through a different DR-CAFTA mechanism, namely by the controlling shareholders presenting a claim under Article 10.16.1(b) on behalf of the local enterprise itself.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 5 (\"Article 10.16.1(a) of CAFTA-DR only allows Claimants to recover direct damages\").\n\n120.\n\nThus framed, the question essentially is the same one that arises under Respondent\u2019s second ground for dismissal, which is that Claimants \"do not have standing to seek to recover Exmingua\u2019s losses,\"116 or even to seek their own losses if these were causally derived from Exmingua\u2019s losses. Although Respondent frames this question as a matter of admissibility,117 the Tribunal sees it more fundamentally as an issue of jurisdiction. Either DR-CAFTA provides consent under Article 10.16.1(a) for a shareholder claim based on indirect or \"reflective\" harm, measured by the diminished value of the shareholder\u2019s shares in a local enterprise, or it does not. If the Treaty provides no such consent, there is no need to reach secondary arguments about admissibility: Claimants would have chosen to proceed under a path that had not been offered to them. There can be no mutual consent in these circumstances, and issues of admissibility therefore do not arise. Correspondingly, if the Treaty provides consent for such claims, the Tribunal has not been alerted to any special reason why it should decline to exercise the jurisdiction it has been granted.\n\n*See* Respondent's chart reproduced in \u00b6 55 above.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 6, 83.\n\n121.\n\nRespondent\u2019s third related ground for dismissal is that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine claims for \"Exmingua\u2019s losses,\" because Claimants did not submit a waiver by Exmingua pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.2.118 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, recasting the issue as about whether proper waivers were submitted does not advance the debate beyond the core jurisdictional question presented. That is because, on its face, Article 10.18.2 does not require an enterprise waiver for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), but only for those submitted on behalf of an enterprise under Article 10.16.1(b),119*i.e.,* the alternative avenue that Claimants concededly have not pursued.120 In consequence, the issue of waivers will become moot upon determination of the core jurisdictional issue the Tribunal has identified. Stated flatly: if there is jurisdiction for Claimants to proceed as they have done under Article 10.16.1(a), then they have submitted sufficient waivers to do so - and if there is no jurisdiction to proceed under Article 10.16.1(a), then it would not matter what waivers they submitted, as an additional waiver would not cure the fundamental problem of lack of consent.\n\n*See* Respondent's chart reproduced in \u00b6 55 above; *see also* Respondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 7, 11(a), 82.\n\n*See* DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.2 (\"No claim may be submitted to arbitration under this Section unless \u2026 (b) the notice of arbitration is accompanied, (i) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(a), by the claimant's written waiver, and (ii) for claims submitted to arbitration under Article 10.16.1(b), by the claimant's and the enterprise's written waivers \u2026.\") (CL-0001-ENG).\n\nIn this respect, DR-CAFTA is distinct from NAFTA, which requires enterprise waivers to accompany claims submitted under *eithe* r its Article 1116 (for a claimant's own losses, where those losses involve damage to its interest in a local enterprise) or its Article 1117 (for claims on behalf of the enterprise, for the enterprise's losses). *See* NAFTA Articles 1121.1(b), 1121.2(b) (CL-0034-ENG).\n\n122.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal considers each of Respondent\u2019s three grounds for dismissal related to Article 10.16.1(a) to boil down to a single fundamental question: does DR-CAFTA provide jurisdiction for an investor to proceed under that Article with a claim seeking compensation for losses that are not a direct result of the challenged State conduct, but rather are \"reflective\" losses,121 flowing indirectly to the investor in consequence of State conduct towards an enterprise in which it holds shares? The Tribunal addresses this question below.\n\nFor purposes of this decision, the Tribunal adopts the definition of \"reflective loss\" provided by Professor Douglas, namely that \"[r]eflective loss can be defined as 'the diminution of the value of the shares [\u2026] the loss of dividends [\u2026] and all other payments which the shareholder may have obtained from the company if it had not been deprived of its funds.'\" Z. Douglas, THE INTERNATIONAL LAW OF INVESTMENT CLAIMS (2009), p. 402.\n\nB. *Interpretation of Article 10.16.1*\n--------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Parties broadly agree that DR-CAFTA should be interpreted by means of a traditional VCLT analysis, in particular according to the principles set forth in VCLT Articles 31 and 32. In conducting this analysis of the core question presented, the Tribunal bears in mind several propositions. First, under VCLT Article 31, the provisions of DR-CAFTA are to be interpreted and applied in accordance with the \"ordinary meaning\" of their terms, in the \"context\" in which they occur and in light of the Treaty's \"object and purpose.\"122 While the Contracting Parties' use of unambiguous terms should be taken as reflecting their clear intent, context and purpose must also be considered. The relevant \"context\" for construing any given passage in a treaty includes the words and sentences found in close proximity to that passage, including definitional terms, as well as other provisions of the same treaty which help illuminate its object and purpose.123 In accordance with VCLT Article 31(3), a tribunal construing the terms of DR-CAFTA should also take into account *(inter alia)* \"any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions,\" as well as \"any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation.\"124\n\nVCLT, Article 31(1).\n\n*See generally Kili\u00e7 \u012cn\u015faat \u012cthalat \u012chracat Sanayi ve Ticaret Anonim \u015eirketi v Turkmenistan*, ICSID Case No ARB/10/1, Award \u00b6 5.2.6 (2 July 2013) (\"Treaty terms are obviously not drafted in isolation, and their meaning can only be determined by considering the entire treaty text. The context will include the remaining terms of the sentence and of the paragraph; the entire article at issue; and the remainder of the treaty [\u2026].\").\n\nVCLT, Article 31(2).\n\n124.\n\nIn accordance with Article 32 of the VCLT, \"[r]ecourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion,\" only \"to confirm the meaning\" resulting from the textual approach required by Article 31, or in the event the textual approach leaves a meaning \"ambiguous or obscure\" or would lead to a result that is \"manifestly absurd or unreasonable.\"125 The ICJ has explained that even in these circumstances, \"a decisive reason\" (such as unmistakable evidence of the State Parties' intentions from such supplementary materials) would be required \"[t]o warrant an interpretation other than that which ensues from the natural meaning of the words\" of a provision.126\n\nVCLT, Article 32.\n\n*Admission of a State to Membership in the United Nations* (Charter, Article 4), Advisory Opinion: I.C.J Reports 1948, p. 57, p. 63.\n\n125.\n\nIn applying these principles to the DR-CAFTA, the Tribunal acknowledges that debate about the concept of \"reflective loss\" has arisen in a variety of contexts, including in investment cases under other treaties (Argentine BITs, NAFTA, etc.) and also in analysis of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. While such debate may be part of the historical background against which the DR-CAFTA Parties negotiated, this cannot be the starting point of any VCLT analysis of what they actually agreed in the final DR-CAFTA text. The Tribunal thus agrees with Respondent that it \"must decide this case based on the specific regime that the CAFTA-DR Parties agreed to (*lex specialis*), and not rely on the interpretation of older treaties by other tribunals addressing different frameworks.\"127 The Tribunal begins this analysis below with an assessment of the Treaty's plain text.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 32.\n\n*i. Ordinary meaning of Article 10.16.1(a)*\n-------------------------------------------\n\n126.\n\nClaimants have invoked Article 10.16.1(a), which states in relevant part that \"[i]n the event that a disputing party considers that *an investment dispute* cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation: (a) the claimant, *on its own behalf*, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim (i) that the respondent has breached (A) an obligation under Section A,..; and (ii) that the claimant *has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of*, that breach....\" (emphasis added). Several phrases in this provision, italicized above, are relevant to its construction.\n\n127.\n\nFirst, the phrase \"investment dispute\" must be understood in the context of Article 10.1(1), which states that Chapter Ten on Investment applies to \"measures adopted or maintained by a Party relating to... covered investments.\" The notion of a \"covered investment\" in turn hearkens back to the definition of investment in Article 10.28, which states that an investment may take the form, *inter alia,* of an \"enterprise\" or \"shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an enterprise.\" There appears to be no dispute in this case that Claimants hold a covered investment, by virtue of their collective ownership (directly and indirectly) of the shares of a local enterprise (Exmingua). Contrary to Claimants\u2019 suggestion, however, this does not appreciably assist the jurisdictional analysis,128 because the fact that shares are protected does not necessarily imply that shareholders may seek damages for loss of share *value,* as opposed to deprivation of share *ownership* or interference with shareholder *rights.* For that proposition, one must examine the additional words of Article 10.16.1(a), authorizing \"the claimant, on its own behalf,\" to submit a claim that \"the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of,\" an alleged breach of a Treaty obligation.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 14 (contending that \"the inclusion of 'shares' within the definition of 'investment' supports the conclusion that the Treaty allows claims for reflective loss\").\n\n128.\n\nThe phrase \"on its own behalf\u2019 plainly refers to the entity whose interests are being pursued. To act on behalf on someone means to act for their benefit or to represent their interests. When a claimant proceeds under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a), it does not purport to be acting for anyone\u2019s benefit or interest other than its own - a point to which the Tribunal returns when assessing the contrasting language in Article 10.16.1(b). The clear text of Article 10.16.1(a) allows a claimant to proceed for its sole benefit for any claims that *it* has \"incurred loss or damage\" *(i.e.,* an alleged result), \"by reason of, or arising out of\" a challenged State action (*i.e.*, an alleged causal link).\n\n129.\n\nWith respect to the critical phrase *\"incurred loss or damage,\"\u2019* it important to note both what it says and what it does not. First, as to what it says, the requirement is that the claimant itself must have \"incurred\" harm; it would not be sufficient for a claimant to demonstrate only that a local enterprise in which it has an interest has incurred harm. The burden is on the claimant to allege (and eventually to prove) its own injury. Second, the claimant bears the burden of proving causation, *i.e.,* that its own injury was suffered \"by reason of, or arising out of\u2019 the challenged State conduct. The more tenuous the connection between the challenged conduct and the alleged injury to a claimant, the heavier this burden may be.\n\n130.\n\nBut notably, nothing in the plain text of Article 10.16.1(a) forbids a claimant from trying to make such showings of injury and causation based on a multi-step analysis, such as the one that would be necessary for any claimant arguing that it incurred harm through a *chain of events* starting with State conduct towards a company in which it holds shares. There is no qualification in the provision that limits the mechanisms through which loss must be incurred. Thus, although Respondent cites various secondary sources opining that Article 10.16.1(a) is limited to pursuit of \"direct\" loss or damage, the words \"direct\" or \"indirect\" appear nowhere in the provision itself.129 Nor is a limitation to direct harm a necessary implication of the causation requirement, namely that injury be incurred \"by reason of, or arising out of\u2019 the challenged conduct. The causation requirement points to a \"but for\" analysis, but it does not restrict that analysis to a single-step of \"but for\" postulation, nor indicate that there is a threshold requirement of immediate or proximate causation, such that injuries based on more attenuated causation would automatically fall outside the scope of consent. It would have been possible, of course, for the DR-CAFTA Parties to include a reference to direct injury or direct causation in the Treaty provision, but they did not do so. Thus, if the interpretative lens were restricted to Article 10.16.1(a) alone, the text of this provision would not support a conclusion that an investor is barred even from trying to establish, through a chain of causation, that it suffered injury in consequence of State conduct that immediately impacted at a downstream entity in which it holds shares.\n\nThe absence of any such language in the corresponding NAFTA provisions was acknowledged by the *Clayton* tribunal, notwithstanding its eventual finding on different grounds that \"in principle\" NAFTA should be interpreted as not allowing reflective loss claims under Article 1116. *Clayton, Award on Damages,* \u00b6 389 (CL-0070-ENG). Prior to reaching this conclusion, the *Clayton* tribunal observed that \"[t]he critical question in this case is the meaning of 'the investor has incurred loss or damage' arising out of the breach. The terms of Article 1116 do not make clear whether they are limited to direct loss or they can include indirect loss, that is, reflective loss.\" *Clayton, Award on Damages,* \u00b6 371 (CL-0070-ENG). Professor Douglas has similarly observed that NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117 \"left open\" the question whether shareholder actions for reflective loss were available, and that \"[t]he arguments for and against each possible interpretation are evenly balanced,\" at least as a purely textual matter. Z. Douglas, *The International Law of Investment* Claims (2009), \u00b6 835 (RL-0068-ENG).\n\n*ii. Context of Article 10.16.1(a)*\n-----------------------------------\n\n131.\n\nNonetheless, any VCLT interpretation must rest not on construction of a treaty provision in isolation, but rather on that provision in the context of surrounding or otherwise relevant treaty provisions. The most important context for Article 10.16.1(a) is Article 10.16.1(b) which immediately follows, and indeed Respondent acknowledges that its key argument for limiting the former to direct injury rests on inferences drawn from the two provisions read in conjunction.130 The Tribunal agrees with this methodology and therefore turns next to Article 10.16.1(b).\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply, \u00b6 57, n.92 (\"The primary legal basis for Respondent's lack of standing argument is not the traditional principle of international law that 'a company has a legal personality distinct from that of its shareholders.' \u2026. Respondent bases its argument on the very language of the Treaty which, under Article 10.16.1(b), allows shareholders to bring claims 'when the enterprise has incurred loss or damage,' provided that a few requirements are met.\").\n\n132.\n\nArticle 10.16.1(b) has a parallel construction to Article 10.16.1(a). It starts with an indication of whose interest is being pursued, namely that a claimant may proceed to arbitration under that Section *\"on behalf of an enterprise* of the respondent that is a juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or indirectly....\" (emphasis added). Utilizing the same definition of \"on behalf of,\" this provision provides a mechanism by which a controlling shareholder may act, not for its own sake, but rather for the benefit of a local enterprise, representing its interests. If a claimant seeks to do this, the necessary predicate that it must allege (and eventually prove) is that \"the *enterprise* has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of,\" the alleged breach (emphasis added). In other words, if an investor wishes to bring a DR-CAFTA claim in representation of another entity, it must prove injury to and causation with respect to that represented entity. The investor simply stands in the entity's shoes for purposes of making the claim.\n\n133.\n\nAt the same time, and precisely because the claimant stands in the enterprise's shoes for purposes of an Article 10.16.1(b) claim, a claim under this Article apparently may be brought for the *full* measure of \"loss or damage\" the enterprise incurred, without restriction based on the upstream division of shareholding interests. Under this provision, a hypothetical 51% shareholder could assert the same claim under Article 10.16.1(b), on behalf of the enterprise it controls, as it could if it had owned 100% of the shares, seemingly without regard to the identity (or protected or unprotected treaty status) of the actual holders of the other 49% of the shares. This is because it is asserting the *enterprise\u2019s* injury and not its own.131 Nor would the claimant bringing an Article 10.16.1(b) claim have to demonstrate whether, how, and to what extent *it* ultimately might have incurred harm as a result of the enterprise\u2019s injury (such as through the non-payment of expected dividends or the diminished market value of shares). The sole questions for purposes of Article 10.16.1(b) standing, where the claimant proceeds \"on behalf of\u2019 the enterprise, are whether the claimant owns or controls the enterprise and whether the enterprise itself has incurred injury by reason of the alleged State breach.\n\nThe Tribunal returns below to the implications of this fact for DR-CAFTA's regulation of the entity to which any damages award must be paid.\n\n134.\n\nThere is no doubt that this alternative mechanism in Article 10.16.1(b) can be invoked *only* by a controlling shareholder, although the control in question may be exercised either \"directly or indirectly,\" according to the provision\u2019s terms. A minority shareholder can never bring a claim under Article 10.16.1(b), and therefore - to the extent it has any path itself to DR-CAFTA arbitration, an issue to which the Tribunal returns further below - that path would have to be through Article 10.16.1(a). For the controlling shareholder, however, the question is whether the path offered to it under Article 10.16.1(b) becomes the only way it may bring a claim predicated on State action which harms the local enterprise, or whether Article 10.16.1(b) provides an optional additional path, without displacing the possibility of pursuing an Article 10.16.1(a) claim solely for its own (indirect) injury (namely, an injury to its shareholding interest in the injured enterprise).\n\n135.\n\nOtherwise stated, does the inclusion of the Article 10.16.1(b) path for a controlling shareholder provide an implicit answer to the scope or limitations of the Article 10.16.1(a) path? Does it indicate a clear intent that the former be limited to instances of direct injury to an investor, and not instances of derivative injury flowing to it through harm to its downstream investment? For Claimants, the answer to this core question is no: \"if an investor owns or controls an enterprise, it has the additional option of submitting a claim under Article 10.16.1(b), but it need not do so.\"132 For Respondent, the answer is yes: \"If the injury is to the company, CAFTA-DR *requires* the claim be submitted by the investor on the company's behalf. Also, if the claimant's injury is only indirect, that is, the shares lost value as a result of injury to the company, that company *has to* bring a claim on behalf of the enterprise that sustained the injury under Article 10.16.1(b) of CAFTA-DR.\"133\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 21; *see also id.* \u00b6 33 (citing *Pope & Talbot*, *Award* \u00b6 80, CL-0028-ENG, for its finding that \"the existence of Article 1117 does not bar bringing a claim under Article 1116.\").\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 42(b) (emphasis added).\n\n136.\n\nThe difficulty is that the majority of the Tribunal finds no textual basis in either Article 10.16.1(a) or 10.16.1(b) for Respondent's conclusion that the Treaty *\"requires\"* the use of the latter where available, such that the company \"*has to*\" pursue that path and is prohibited from invoking the former instead. Nor is there any textual indication of such an intent by use of so-called \"linkage\" or \"relationship\" words that might explain the intended interaction between the two provisions. The provisions are separated by an \"and,\" *viz:* \"(a) the claimant, on its own behalf, may....; *and* (b) the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise... may....\").134 The word \"and\" customarily implies an addition, not a mutual exclusion or a conditionality. There is no use of any other linkage language which might have implied exclusivity, such as \"if and only if,\" \"except where,\" or \"may, unless...\" Thus, solely grammatically, it would appear that Article 10.16.1 provides two options, each with its own specification of *who* must be shown to have sustained loss of damage (the claimant or the enterprise), but without mandating that if an investor *can* make the latter showing \"on behalf of\u2019 the enterprise, then this is its only available path to jurisdiction. Such a mandate (or restriction) could have been expressed in the treaty text, but this was not done, at least with any clarity that the majority of the Tribunal can identify.\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.16.1 (emphasis added) (CL-0001-ENG).\n\n137.\n\nThe next question in a VCLT analysis is whether additional assistance is provided by other Treaty provisions, which might cast further light on the intended scope and interpretation of the two parts of Article 10.16.1. Claimants invoke DR-CAFTA's definition of investment, as including express reference to shares as one protected form.135 As noted above, however, it would prove too much to say that inclusion of shares as a protected investment necessarily answers the question of *what kind* of injury to a shareholding interests is cognizable under the Treaty. There is no dispute, for example, that a claimant could invoke Article 10.16.1(a) for a direct injury to its shareholder rights, such as interference with dividend distribution or voting rights, or where the enterprise\u2019s assets have been expropriated, which would leave the shareholder with bare title to a stripped entity.136 Claimants assert an expropriation claim here,137 so in theory that claim could survive even on Respondent\u2019s interpretation of the provision.138 The broader question of whether DR-CAFTA permits shareholders to pursue reflective loss claims for derivative injury, in circumstances short of complete expropriation, is not answered simply by reference to the definition of investment.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 14.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 42(a) (\"Article 10.16.1(a) allows a claimant to seek to recovery direct injury to shareholders,\" which \"results from violations to their rights as shareholders,\" such as \"the right to any declared dividend, the right to attend and vote at general meetings, [and] the right to share in the residual assets of the company on liquidation\") (quoting *Barcelona Traction*, \u00b6 47 (RL-0006)); *see id.*, \u00b6 42(a), n.44 (quoting the U.S. Government Submission in *Clayton*, RL-0008, for the proposition that shareholders could use NAFTA Article 1116 to assert \"a direct loss or damage \u2026 where the disputing State wrongfully expropriates the shareholders' ownership interests \u2013 whether directly through an expropriation of the shares or indirectly by expropriating the enterprise as a whole\").\n\n*See* Notice of Intent, p. 4; Notice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 75-77.\n\n*See* Partial Dissenting Opinion, \u00b6 28.\n\n138.\n\nRespondent invokes three other DR-CAFTA provisions as additional context, namely Article 10.18.2 (on waivers), Article 10.26 (on payment of awards) and Annex 10-E (on the implications of prior local proceedings).139 However, in the view of the majority, none of these provisions commands a different reading of the Article 10.16.1 text than appears on its face.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 38, 56\n\n139.\n\nWith respect to Articles 10.18.2 and 10.26, it is clear that DR-CAFTA sets out different preconditions for and consequences of a claim, depending on whether a claimant invokes Article 10.16.1(a) (to claim *\"on its own behalf\"* for its own asserted injury) or Article 10.16.1(b) (to claim *\"on behalf of\"* an enterprise for the enterprise\u2019s asserted injury). In either case, the claimant must submit a waiver of local proceedings by the entity on whose \"behalf\u2019 the claim is brought140 - and in either case, any damages awarded must be paid to that same entity, *i.e.,* the entity on whose \"behalf\u2019 the claim is brought.141 But these distinctions flow logically from the notion of bringing a claim \"on behalf of\u2019 *(i.e.,* \"in the shoes of,\" or representing, or for the benefit of) a particular entity.142 They do not themselves confirm the intended *scope* of any given path.\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.18.2 (CL-0001-ENG).\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.26.2 (CL-0001-ENG).\n\nIn particular, if a claim is brought \"on behalf of\" a local entity \u2013 meaning that the claimant is representing its interests rather than the claimant's own \u2013 it stands to reason that any recovery for the enterprise's losses must be to the enterprise itself. An upstream shareholder could not bypass the local enterprise, whom it purports to represent, to seize the benefits of that representation solely for itself. As a corollary, however, if the claimant brings a claim only \"on its own behalf,\" then any recovery could only be to the extent of its own proven losses, which may be both harder to prove and lower in amount than the enterprise's own direct losses.\n\n140.\n\nThe Tribunal acknowledges Respondent\u2019s argument that permitting a claimant to bring a reflective loss claim under Article 10.16.1(a), while not requiring it to file an enterprise waiver as it would have to do had it proceeded instead under Article 10.16.1(b), could result in complications. For example, the enterprise could pursue local remedies for its direct losses, while its upstream shareholders could pursue claims of treaty breach related to the same challenged measures.143 This creates some risk of inconsistent rulings on common issues of fact or local law, and some possibility of duplicative victories that could result in double recovery. The Tribunal acknowledges these policy concerns, but as discussed further below, its role is not to determine how best to address policy concerns, only to determine what the Contracting State Parties themselves have provided.\n\nThe Tribunal does not address in this decision the separate question of whether, and under what circumstances, an upstream investor might be able to invoke Article 10.16.1(a) to claim for its own injury on the basis of a State's breach of an investment agreement with the local enterprise. The Partial Dissenting Opinion suggests the majority would allow such claims (*see* Partial Dissenting Opinion, *\u00b6* 12), but to be clear, the majority decision does not purport to reach this question, because the issue of shareholder standing with respect to breaches of local enterprise contracts was never even argued by the Parties in this case.\n\n141.\n\nWith respect to waivers, for example, the DR-CAFTA Parties easily could have required dual waivers for any claims under Article 10.16.1(a) involving a local enterprise; that is precisely what the NAFTA Parties did for claims brought under the fairly similar NAFTA Article 1116, notwithstanding NAFTA's similar structural distinction between Article 1116 (claims asserted on a claimant's \"own behalf\u2019) and Article 1117 (claims asserted \"on behalf of an enterprise\u2019).144 By contrast, the DR-CAFTA Parties chose *not* to require double waivers under Article 10.16.1(a). There is no indication in the Treaty text that they did this to adopt a different approach to reflective loss claims; to the contrary, each of the NAFTA Parties has objected to reflective loss claims being asserted under Article 1116, notwithstanding NAFTA's requirement of enterprise waivers for Article 1116 claims. It is therefore difficult for the Tribunal to conclude, simply from DR-CAFTA's omission of the NAFTA double-waiver requirement for claims brought on a claimant's \"own behalf,\" that this was done to clarify an intended bar on bringing reflective loss claims. There are other far more direct ways the State Parties could have provided such a clarification within the Treaty's express text.\n\nNAFTA, Article 1121.1 (\"A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1116 to arbitration only if: \u2026 (b) *the investor, and* where the claim is for loss or damage to an interest in an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, *the enterprise*, waive their right \u2026.\"). CL-0034-ENG (emphasis added).\n\n142.\n\nFinally, Annex 10-E of DR-CAFTA does not provide helpful context to resolve the intended scope of Article 10.16.1(a). Respondent argues that allowing Claimants to pursue reflective loss claims under that Article would circumvent Annex 10-E's bar on a U.S. claimant's pursuing treaty claims (such as \"full protection and security\"), in circumstances where its local enterprise already has pursued related local remedies (for example, protesting the failures of local policing).145 This argument fails, for two reasons. First, Annex 10-E by its plain terms attaches only where the local court action already has \"alleged *that breach of an obligation under Section A*,\" *i.e.,* the same alleged Treaty breach as the U.S. investor seeks to assert under DR-CAFTA.146 This circumstance could arise in some DR-CAFTA countries, where international treaties have direct effect and can give rise to private rights of action under local law.147\n\n*See* Respondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 78 (contending that \"[h]ad Claimants initiated this Arbitration on behalf of Exmingua under Article 10.16.1(b) of CAFTA-DR), they would be precluded from bringing their full protection and security claim again in this Arbitration under Annex 10-E of CAFTA-DR\").\n\nDR-CAFTA, Annex 10-E(1) (CL-0001-ENG) (emphasis added). *See Corona*, \u00b6 269 (RL-0002-ENG) (noting that DR-CAFTA's \"fork in the road\" provision, Article 10.18.4, and the associated Annex-E for U.S. investors, \"appl[y] only to claims of an alleged breach of an obligation under Section A of Chapter 10\" asserted in local proceedings). As in the *Nissan* case, there is therefore no need for this Tribunal to take any position in the doctrinal debate about fork-in-the-road clauses, as to whether a \"triple identity\" test or a \"fundamental basis\" test might be more appropriate in the absence of expressly defined treaty terms. The use of specific defined terms (in DR-CAFTA, the requirement of an asserted \"breach of an obligation under Section A\") \"leaves no textual ambiguity for the Tribunal to resolve in this fashion.\" *Nissan*, \u00b6 215 (CL-0078-ENG).\n\n*See Corona*, \u00b6 269 (RL-0002-ENG); *cf. Nissan*, \u00b6 216 (CL-0078-ENG) (noting that for other \"national systems [that] do not provide a judicial or administrative avenue to pursue alleged treaty breaches, a treaty provision barring international arbitration only where proceedings in those States have alleged a treaty breach would have little practical effect\").\n\n143.\n\nSecond, and more fundamentally for present purposes, Annex 10-E makes no distinction between treaty claims brought under Article 10.16.1(a) and those brought under Article 10.16.1(b): in either case, the impediment to filing a treaty claim (such as it is) applies on the exact same terms.148 It is therefore not logically possible to read Annex 10-E as providing any additional context to elucidate what distinctions may have been intended between claims being brought through one path or the other. Nothing in Annex 10-E helps illustrate the intended scheme in Article 10.16.1, or explains or limits in particular the scope of claims that a claimant might bring under Article 10.16.1(a), \"on its own behalf,\" for the \"loss or damage\" that it has \"incurred... by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.\"\n\nDR-CAFTA, Annex 10-E.1 (CL-0001-ENG) (\"An investor of the United States may not submit to arbitration \u2026 a claim that [another Treaty Party] has breached an obligation under Section A *either: (a) on its own behalf under Article 10.16.1(a), or (b) on behalf of an enterprise \u2026 under Article 10..16.1(b),* if the investor or the enterprise, respectively, has alleged that breach of an obligation under Section A in proceedings before a court or administrative tribunal \u2026.\") (emphasis added).\n\n144.\n\nIn short, the majority of the Tribunal is unable to find anything in the Treaty text itself, including the context of various provisions related to Article 10.16.1, which would impose a limitation of \"direct\" losses, or an exclusion for derivative or reflective loss, onto Article 10.16.1(a)\u2019s open language about a claimant pursuing its own losses on its own behalf.\n\n*iii. Effet utile*\n------------------\n\n145.\n\nNonetheless, the Tribunal takes seriously Respondent\u2019s arguments about *effet utile,* namely that whatever the strict textual interpretation of Articles 10.16.1(a) and (b) might be, the intent of the Contracting State Parties could not have been to make the first path so broad as to render the second path effectively meaningless. Respondent argues that if a controlling shareholder could pursue derivative claims under Article 10.16.1(a), without having to file an enterprise waiver and without having to channel any financial recovery through the enterprise itself, there is no reason it would *ever* invoke Article 10.16.1(b), which imposes both of these requirements.149 The Tribunal notes that in the NAFTA context, the *Clayton* tribunal was troubled by a similar argument, observing that permitting reflective loss claims under NAFTA Article 1116 \"would raise questions about the relationship between\" that Article and NAFTA Article 1117, *\"perhaps* rendering 1117 inutile.\"150 The *Clayton* tribunal did not further analyze this possibility.\n\nThe Partial Dissenting Opinion chides the majority for addressing the *effet utile* argument \"from the perspective of the putative claimants,\" to determine if a rational claimant ever would pursue Article 10.16.1(b) if Article 10.16.1(a) were construed as available in the alternative. Partial Dissenting Opinion \u00b6 13. The majority notes that this was largely the way the argument was framed in this case. *See, e.g.,* Respondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 71 (\"It is difficult to imagine why a shareholder would elect to bring a claim for the account of its company if it had the option of bypassing the company altogether.\") (quoting Z. Douglas, *The International Law of Investment* Claims (2009), \u00b6 848 (RL-0068-ENG)); Transcript of 16 December 2019 Hearing, p. 100 (Prof. Douglas: \"[W]hen would any Majority Shareholder bring a claim under (b)? Doesn't it read out the mechanism envisaged by (b) because no one in their right mind would ever go down that route if they had the option?\").\n\n*Clayton*, *Award on Damages,* \u00b6 372 (CL-0070-ENG) (emphasis added).\n\n146.\n\nWith all due respect to the *Clayton* tribunal, the \"perhaps\" in its reasoning is not sufficient to persuade this Tribunal that Article 10.16.1(b) would be rendered entirely useless, if Article 10.16.1(a)\u2019s requirement that a claimant have \"incurred loss or damage\" is interpreted to mean just what it says, without inferring a non-textual limitation of only \"direct\" loss. First, as the claimants in *Clayton* also observed, if the local enterprise remained a going concern - *i.e.,* it had not been subject to expropriation but only to lesser harm - then the controlling shareholder might well view the alternative path, of bringing a claim \"on behalf of\" the enterprise and allowing an award directly to the enterprise, to be \"a more suitable option\" to restore the health of the weakened operation.151 Certainly, this would be the case if restitution is sought, since that remedy is open only to the enterprise under Article 10.16.1(b), not to its shareholders under Article 10.16.1(a).152 But even if monetary damages are sought (as most often in these cases), there is no reason to assume that a controlling shareholder who prefers to continue operating the local business necessarily would bypass it, in order to hijack an award to its own account.\n\n*Clayton, Award on Damages,* \u00b6 358 (CL-0070-ENG). While the Partial Dissenting Opinion criticizes the majority for assuming that the Treaty intended to provide \"the broadest possible flexibility\" to controlling shareholders, *see* Partial Dissenting Opinion, \u00b6 14, the majority makes no such assumption. It simply concludes that the structure of Article 10.16.1 of the Treaty gives a majority shareholder a choice, whether that choice is broad or otherwise.\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.26.2(a) (CL-0001-ENG).\n\n147.\n\nThis is particularly the case where the controlling shareholder does not hold all of the enterprise\u2019s shares. By pursuing the Article 10.16.1(b) path, the controlling shareholder could provide the going-concern enterprise with a potential route to far greater damages recovery, and therefore greater restored health, precisely because the claim could be brought for the enterprise\u2019s full injury regardless of its upstream shareholding structure. Thus, for the hypothetical 51%-49% joint venture discussed above, the 51% shareholder could bring a claim \"on behalf of\u2019 the joint venture under Article 10.16.1(b), seeking damages payable to the enterprise for 100% of the enterprise\u2019s losses, regardless of the nationality of the minority shareholder. By contrast, the same shareholder proceeding on \"its own behalf\u2019 under Article 10.16.1(a) *at best* could seek only 51% of the damages -and most likely would face strong objections even to a claim for that amount, on the basis that in a \"but for\" world, the enterprise as a going concern would not have distributed all of its earnings upstream to its shareholders, but instead would have used substantial portions for other purposes, including paying off potential debts, covering additional costs, and the like.\n\n148.\n\nThis latter point introduces yet another limitation of the *effet utile* theory, which is that there can be significant hurdles, as a matter of causation and proof, to demonstrating upstream injury in consequence of downstream harm. Reflective loss claims can be quite difficult to prove at the damages stage.153 The Tribunal can imagine various scenarios where a controlling shareholder might prefer not to have to grapple with these additional hurdles, or risk a skeptical tribunal, when it alternatively could bring a claim \"on behalf of\u2019 the local enterprise and more cleanly seek full recovery for the enterprise of all of the enterprise\u2019s losses.\n\nFor an example of the additional hurdles, *see Nykomb*, p. 39 (CL-0073-ENG) (explaining that in a but-for world where the enterprise would have received additional income, \"it is clear that the higher payments \u2026 would not have flowed fully and directly through to [the investor]. The money would have been subject to Latvian taxes etc., would have been used to cover [the enterprise's] costs and down payments on [the enterprise's loans etc., and disbursements to the shareholder would be subject to restrictions in Latvian company law on payment of dividends.\").\n\n149.\n\nThe point of this discussion is not to determine which path ultimately would prove more appealing to controlling shareholders in different situations and with different objectives. That could depend on a number of variables. Rather, the point is that for a treaty interpretation to rest on an *effet utile* conclusion, beyond simply construing the ordinary meaning of treaty terms in their context, a tribunal must be convinced that the alternative interpretation would leave a treaty provision with *no effective meaning at all.* It is not enough to say that the textual interpretation would make path \"a\" (an Article 10.16.1(a) claim) potentially more attractive than it otherwise might be under a different interpretation; the Tribunal would have to conclude that path \"b\" (an Article 10.16.1(b) claim) would be left to serve no purpose at all. The *Clayton* tribunal did not make a case for such a finding under NAFTA (only speculating that \"perhaps\" it could be so), and this Tribunal (by majority) is unable to make such a finding under DR-CAFTA.\n\n*iv. Object and Purpose*\n------------------------\n\n150.\n\nHaving thus failed to find a limitation on Article 10.16.1(a) claims either in the Treaty\u2019s text or by virtue of the *effet utile* principle, the next step in a VCLT analysis is to determine if the Treaty\u2019s \"object and purpose\" nonetheless dictates such a limitation.154 On that question, the Tribunal agrees with the *Clayton* tribunal (which considered a similar question in the NAFTA context) that appeals to the object and purpose of the Treaty as a whole are not \"particularly helpful\" in interpretation of the relevant provisions.155 It is certainly true, as Claimants emphasize, that the DR-CAFTA Preamble refers to a goal to \"ENSURE a predictable commercial framework for business planning and investment,\"156 and that its Article 1.2 lists as \"Objectives,\" *inter alia,* to \"substantially increase investment opportunities in the territories of the Parties.\"157 But that observation cannot be the end of the story. Every treaty creates a varied and nuanced balance between extending protections and limiting or conditioning those protections. It would be too facile to simply advert to the general notion of investor protection as a catch-all tool (or a proverbial finger-on-the-scale) to resolve all disputed issues regarding the extent, limits or conditions on protections.\n\nVCLT, Article 31(1).\n\n*Clayton, Award on Damages*, \u00b6 375 (CL-0070-ENG).\n\nDR-CAFTA, Preamble (CL-0001-ENG).\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 1.2.1(d) (CL-0001-ENG).\n\n151.\n\nNor can the interpretative question be resolved simply by observing, as Claimants do, that Respondent\u2019s reading of Article 10.16.1(a) would leave minority shareholders \"entirely unprotected,\" unable ever to bring claims for the diminished value of their shares attributable to wrongful State conduct.158 The Tribunal agrees that this would be the *effect* of interpreting that Article to exclude reflective loss claims, since minority shareholders -unlike controlling shareholders - could not pursue Article 10.16.1(b)\u2019s alternative path of bringing claims \"on behalf of\u2019 the local enterprise. Accordingly, in the hypothetical joint venture context described above, the 49% shareholder would be dependent on the 51% shareholder to protect its interest, either by initiating an investment treaty claim on the enterprise\u2019s behalf (if the 51% shareholder has qualifying nationality under a treaty that provides such an option), or by pursuing local remedies on behalf of the enterprise.159 Claimants are also correct that such an interpretation, which would leave minority shareholders with treaty remedies only over direct assaults on shareholder rights or in the event of expropriation, would constitute a more significant restriction than other tribunals have been willing to read into other investment treaties.160 Claimants argue that this could not have been the object and purpose of the DR-CAFTA Parties. At the same time, Respondent is correct that under customary international law, developed in the context of diplomatic protection, minority shareholders did not traditionally have \"reflective loss\" protections either. It is thus entirely possible that State Parties to the earliest investment treaties did not consciously plan to depart from these principles by providing minority shareholders with direct avenues to assert claims for derivative injury - in other words, that they did not foresee the how tribunals ultimately would interpret their chosen treaty text.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 29.\n\nThe *GAMI* tribunal, which was faced with a question under NAFTA about the rights of a minority shareholder, noted that the majority shareholders who were \"Mexican nationals and do not have standing under Chapter 11 of NAFTA,\" might have had \"reasons of their own \u2026 not to cause [the local company] to seek relief before the Mexican courts. In its (They might simply have been defeatists. Or they might have made their separate peace with the Government and abandoned any complaint in return for offsetting benefits.)\" *GAMI*, \u00b6\u00b6 37, 38(B) (CL-0036-ENG).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 6, 37.\n\n152.\n\nAt the end of the day, neither of these interesting arguments about the history of the jurisprudence, or the relationship between customary international law and investment treaty law, helps to resolve the core interpretative question the Tribunal faces here. That question is what the DR-CAFTA Parties, presumably with full knowledge of all that had gone before under prior treaties, *actually decided* to do in DR-CAFTA, by virtue of adopting *the particular Treaty text* that they did. The Tribunal remains bound to answer that question using the VCLT interpretative tools available to it.\n\n153.\n\nBoth Parties identify other negative consequences arising from the other's interpretation. For Claimants, Respondent's interpretation would force controlling shareholders to seek higher damages from States by pursuing Article 10.16.1(b) claims on behalf of their local enterprises, including additional amounts that might be attributable to investments by minority shareholders without treaty rights (such as host State nationals). Claimants correctly observe that Respondent previously objected to precisely such a scenario in the *RDC* case.161 Respondent, for its part, emphasizes that allowing shareholders to assert reflective loss claims could bypass creditors whose claims otherwise would have to be satisfied if awards were paid to the enterprise itself; Respondent also notes the risk of double recovery if the local enterprise prevails in local law claims, while individual shareholders prevail in treaty claims.162 Claimants respond that DR-CAFTA is not intended as a means to help creditors collect from local enterprises; that any creditor claims would be factored into a proper reflective loss damages analysis to reduce recovery by upstream shareholders; and that tribunals have various means to guard against double recovery without improperly declining to exercise jurisdiction.163\n\n*See, e.g.,* Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 15, 22, 53, 59.\n\n*See, e.g.,* Respondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 56, 71.\n\n*See e.g.,* Claimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 49, 70.\n\n154.\n\nUltimately, all of these points are valuable observations from a system design perspective, and no doubt are ones that States can (and should) take into account in considering which avenues of relief they wish to offer investors, and which preconditions to relief they wish to impose. But weighing these competing policy concerns is for States, not arbitrators. In the absence of articulated references to these concerns by the State Parties in a form that the VCLT accepts as probative evidence for treaty interpretation - such as contemporaneous statements in the official *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires* or a subsequent agreement or practice regarding treaty interpretation - it would not be appropriate for arbitrators to use their own views of desirable policy to help guide them (one way or the other) to an interpretation either of the existing text, or of the object and purpose of the DR-CAFTA Parties in agreeing to that text.\n\n*v. Preparatory works; subsequent agreement and practice*\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n155.\n\nNeither Party has submitted excerpts from the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires,* the official record of DR-CAFTA negotiations, to shed light on the evolution of the relevant terms or communications between the State Parties regarding their respective or shared interpretation and intent. Respondent does invoke the U.S. \"Statement of Administrative Action\" presented in 1993 to the U.S. Congress in connection with the ratification process for NAFTA. This statement referred to NAFTA Article 1116 as involving \"allegations of direct injury to an investor\" and Article 1117 as involving \"allegations of indirect injury to an investor caused by injury to a firm in the host country that is owned or controlled by an investor.\"164 As noted above, however, the words \"direct\" and \"indirect\" were not included either in the NAFTA text itself, or in the subsequent DR-CAFTA text, notwithstanding considerable debate about the issue in the interim. More to the point, a single State's interpretation of a treaty, circulated for internal implementation purposes rather than as a negotiating document shared with other State Parties, does not qualify as \"preparatory work\" of the treaty within the meaning of VCLT Article 32 (much less as preparatory work of a later treaty involving a broader set of State Parties). The Tribunal agrees with the *Sempra* tribunal that \"[t]he view of one State does not make international law, even less so when such a view is ascertained only by indirect means of interpretation.... What is relevant is the intention which [all] parties had in signing\" a particular treaty.165\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 65 (citing RL-0070-ENG).\n\n*Sempra Energy International v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, 28 September 2007, \u00b6 385; *see also* *Louis Dreyfus Armateurs SAS v. Republic of India*, PCA Case No. 2014-26, Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 December 2015, \u00b6 90.\n\n156.\n\nNor has the Tribunal been shown anything that could qualify under VCLT Article 31(3) either as a \"subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions,\" or \"any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation.\"166 For both of these concepts, the predicate requirement is an agreement or practice by all of the parties to a particular treaty, not some subset of the treaty parties.167 The Tribunal understands why the *Clayton* tribunal considered it important to acknowledge the \"consistent subsequent practice of NAFTA Parties in their submissions to investor-State tribunals,\"168 and why that tribunal found that this \"subsequent practice militates in favour of adopting Respondent's position on this issue, although only analyzing subsequent practices does not replace the primary rule of interpretation of Article 31(1).\"169 The Tribunal further agrees with the *Clayton* tribunal that the availability of a formal treaty mechanism for authoritative joint interpretations, such as through the Free Trade Commission mechanism in NAFTA or DR-CAFTA,170 is not the sole avenue by which States can express their mutual interpretation of a treaty.171 VCLT Article 31(3) allows for consideration of \"*any* subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its application,\" and a demonstration that *all* the State Parties to a particular treaty had expressed a common understanding, albeit through separate submissions in separate cases, could be compelling evidence of subsequent practice. In the case of DR-CAFTA, however - unlike NAFTA, addressed by the *Clayton* tribunal - there has not yet been any unanimous expression of views about the scope and implications of Article 10.16.1(a).\n\nVCLT, Article 31(2).\n\n*Eskosol S.p.A. in Liquidazione v. Italian Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/50, Decision on Italy's Request for Immediate Termination and Italy's Jurisdictional Objection Based on Applicability of the Energy Charter Treaty to Intra-EU Disputes, 7 May 2019, \u00b6 220 (\"there is a significant distinction in international law between interpretations agreed by *all* Contracting Parties to a multilateral treaty, and those offered unilaterally by *only a subset* of such Parties. This point is firmly established by \u2026 the ILC's 2001 Guide to Practice on Reservations to Treaties, which distinguishes between \"interpretative declarations\" made unilaterally by one or more States or international organizations and those accepted by *all* signatories to a particular treaty.\").\n\n*Clayton, Award on Damages*, \u00b6 376 (CL-0070-ENG).\n\n*Clayton, Award on Damages,* \u00b6 379 (CL-0070-ENG).\n\n*See* DR-CAFTA, Article 10.22.3 (CL-0001-ENG) (\"A decision of the Commission declaring its interpretation of a provision of this Agreement under Article 19.1.3(c) (The Free Trade Commission) shall be binding on a tribunal established under this Section, and any decision or award issued by the tribunal must be consistent with that decision.\").\n\n*Clayton, Award on Damages*, \u00b6 377, 378 (CL-0070-ENG) (\"the Tribunal is not convinced by the Investors' argument that the power of the FTS to make authoritative interpretations of NAFTA replaces the rule in Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT that 'subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation' shall be taken into account 'together with the context'. The NAFTA Parties have an option to make a binding interpretation under Article 1131(2) but the fact that they have not done so means that treaty interpretation simply follows the normal interpretative rules \u2026. In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the commentary to the ILC draft conclusions on 'Subsequent agreements and subsequent practice in relation to the implementation of treaties' includes 'statements in the course of a legal dispute' as potentially relevant subsequent practice of States for the purposes of interpretation.\").\n\nC. *Conclusion*\n---------------\n\n157.\n\nThe broader conclusion of this VCLT interpretative analysis is this: while the Tribunal accepts there may be a range of potential consequences of the Article 10.16.1(a) text, which contains no limitations on the nature or proximity of \"losses\" a claimant can pursue, it is for the States themselves to decide whether they are comfortable with this outcome. The old adage applies here, that States should \"say what they mean and mean what they say.\" The DR-CAFTA States were undoubtedly aware, when they crafted the particular text in this Treaty, of how various investment tribunals had interpreted NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117, including in the context of reflective loss claims. If this was the historical backdrop against which they were working, DR-CAFTA provided an opportunity to express their intentions clearly on the issue, either in the Treaty text or in the *travaux pr\u00e9paratoires.*172 The State Parties clearly knew how to express their views on issues that had arisen under other investment treaties, as they did (for example) in a series of footnotes inserted within the definition of investment.173 But with respect to Article 10.16.1(a), the text they adopted contains no language suggesting that it be interpreted other than through the ordinary meaning of its terms - and the particular terms adopted are not consistent with barring a claimant from pursuing \"on its own behalf\u2019 a claim for losses it \"incurred,\" just because those losses may have been incurred indirectly rather than directly. If this was not what the State Parties intended, they still may clarify this through the recognized mechanisms for doing so, including issuance of a joint interpretation. But unless and until they do so, tribunals interpreting DR-CAFTA must work with the tools they have, rather than ascribing to the State Parties particular intentions which (however potentially sound from a policy perspective) are not revealed through recognized VCLT analysis.\n\nIn the view of the majority, this is the primary difference separating its conclusions from those of the eloquent dissent. The dissent considers that \"what is expressed in the treaty is that the State Parties were motivated to ensure that controlling shareholders could not bring a claim in their own right and at the same time direct their company to pursue other remedies in different fora (Article 10.18). What is also expressed in the treaty is that the State Parties were motivated to ensure that there would be no risk of double recovery and that the rights of creditors of the company would not be undermined or extinguished as result of paying damages directly to shareholders rather than through the company (Article 10.26).\" Partial Dissenting Opinion, \u00b6 14 (emphasis in original). The majority considers that these policy objectives certainly *could have been expressed* in the Treaty text, including through a clear formulation in Article 10.16.1(a) that limited the types of losses for which a claimant might claim \u2013 but for whatever reason, they were not so expressed.\n\n*See, e.g.,* DR-CAFTA Article 10.28 & nn. 8-9 (clarifying that despite the definition of \"investment\" including debt instruments as among the \"[f]orms that an investment may take,\" \"[s]ome forms of debt, such as bonds, debentures, and long-term notes, are more likely to have the characteristics of an investment, while other forms of debt are less likely to have such characteristics,\" and \"claims to payment that are immediately due and result from the sale of goods or services are not investments\"); *see also* n. 11 (clarifying that despite the definition of \"investment\" including \"rights conferred pursuant to domestic law,\" the term \"does not include an order or judgment entered in a judicial or administrative action\").\n\n158.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal refers to the statement of the *Nissan v. India* tribunal, in the context of a different treaty interpretation exercise:\n\nStates are free to adopt whatever treaty text they prefer, including text that is likely to address common situations as well as text addressing circumstances that are unlikely to arise. States are also free to mutually amend prior treaties, if they conclude that the text to which they had agreed - as interpreted through a VCLT analysis - is proving ill-suited to their common objectives. Alternatively, States may seek to issue joint interpretations with prospective effect, to clarify that they had actually intended a meaning beyond what the ordinary meaning of the treaty text might suggest.\n\nHowever, absent State invocation of such tools to clarify on a mutual basis their intentions for future cases, an arbitral tribunal must proceed on the basis of a VCLT analysis of the *existing* text to which they have agreed. It is not within a tribunal\u2019s remit to override the drafting choices evident in a particular treaty, in order to substitute a different test that does not flow from the ordinary meaning of that text in the context of surrounding provisions. Otherwise stated, the task of a tribunal is not to make policy choices about the preferable design of an investment arbitration system, but rather to respect and enforce the choices already made by the Contracting Parties, to the extent these can be divined through the interpretative tools that the VCLT provides. To the extent Contracting State Parties find themselves disappointed by such interpretations, they retain various tools as noted above to address this situation. But they cannot expect an arbitral tribunal to undertake *sub rosa* what they have not undertaken themselves, namely an effort effectively to amend the treaty by ignoring existing text and instead substituting a different approach that the current text cannot support.174\n\n*Nissan, \u00b6\u00b6* 216, 217 (CL-0078-ENG).\n\n159.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal, by a majority, denies Respondent\u2019s first set of Preliminary Objections, which in common address the availability of Article 10.16.1(a) for claims of indirect loss. At the same time, the Tribunal also emphasizes that it is acutely alert to the causation and quantum implications of claims for indirect loss, including the additional hurdles of proof that a claimant pursuing such a claim ultimately may face. The Tribunal thus agrees with prior NAFTA tribunals that it is important to be attuned to the distinction between damages incurred directly by a local enterprise and those said to have been incurred indirectly by an upstream investor,175 including the very real possibility that not all of the former may be equated to the latter.176 At the end of the day, whether these particular Claimants will be able to demonstrate not only that Respondent breached a DR-CAFTA obligation, but also that *they in particular* incurred cognizable \"loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of\u2019 that breach, is a matter for proof. At the Preliminary Objections stage, it suffices that Claimants have so alleged, and the Treaty does not bar them at the outset, as a matter of law, from seeking to prove their case.\n\n*See, e.g., Pope & Talbot*, *Award*, \u00b6 80 (CL-0028-ENG) (\"It remains of course for the Investor to prove that loss or damage was caused to its interest, and that it was causally connected to the breach complained of.\"); *UPS*, *Award* \u00b6 35 (CL-0037-ENG) (distinguishing between its jurisdictional finding and a potential damages question \"of how much of UPS Canada's losses flow through to UPS,\" while seemingly assuming the latter to be straightforward in a situation of only one shareholder).\n\nThe Partial Dissenting Opinion suggests the majority's ruling would allow shareholders to pursue recovery of their own losses, while \"avoid[ing] satisfying the legitimate claims of the creditors\" of the local enterprise. Partial Dissenting Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. To the contrary, the majority has made clear that a proper causation and quantum analysis would *have to factor in* creditor claims, which take priority, before there can be any determination of *net* losses (if any) that actually were incurred by shareholders. Because shareholders in these circumstances do not recover any proceeds that properly were due to creditors, there is thus no issue of the shareholders themselves (much less a tribunal) \"avoid[ing] satisfying\" creditor claims. Creditors of the local enterprise retain all rights and remedies they otherwise had against local enterprise.\n\n160.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal also defers for the merits Claimants\u2019 suggestion that their claim potentially could be seen as one for *direct damages* rather than reflective loss, on the same theory the *Clayton* tribunal adopted to award damages under NAFTA Article 1116 despite finding \"in principle\" that this article does not allow reflective loss claims.177 In *Clayton,* at the liability stage, the tribunal found that the local enterprise (Bilcon) should have been given \"an opportunity to voice its objections\" on an environmental impact issue, that Bilcon was \"denied a fair opportunity to know the case it had to meet,\" and accordingly that \"the Investors and their investment were not afforded a fair opportunity to have the specifics of [their] case considered, assessed and decided in accordance with applicable laws.\"178 At the damages stage, Canada argued that the particular way the claimants framed their damages case was \"impermissible\" under NAFTA Article 1116.179 The Tribunal concluded \"in principle\" that NAFTA Article 1116 does not allow reflective loss claims,180 but nonetheless awarded the claimants damages under that Article, on the theory that the relevant \"loss of opportunity\" (somewhat reframed from the earlier description) had been for the upstream shareholders rather than the enterprise itself.181 Based on this rather broad framing - now described as about an \"opportunity to invest\" - the *Clayton* tribunal concluded that \"compensation is owed directly to the Investors pursuant to Article 1116. It is not precluded by the prohibition against awarding 'reflective loss'.\"182\n\n*See* Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 33.\n\n*Clayton,* Award on Jurisdiction and Liability, 17 March 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 585, 590, 603 (CL-0088-ENG).\n\n*Clayton, Award on Damages*, \u00b6\u00b6 70, 322 (CL-0070-ENG).\n\n*Clayton, Award on Damages*, \u00b6 389 (CL-0070-ENG).\n\nIn its damages decision, the *Clayton* tribunal described its earlier liability findings as about a loss of \"opportunity to develop and submit the \u2026 Project for approval,\" which was \"entirely an opportunity of the Clayton Group in New Jersey\"; stated that \"[t]he fact that the Claytons used a local enterprise as an instrument for pursuing their opportunity \u2026 does not turn that opportunity into Bilcon of Nova Scotia's opportunity,\" since the local enterprise \"was no more than a conduit to facilitate the Clayton's operations.\" It then concluded that \"the *opportunity to invest* in a quarry and a marine terminal, which was denied by the Respondent's unlawful conduct, was an opportunity of the Investors and not an opportunity of Bilcon of Nova Scotia.\" *Clayton, Award on Damages*, \u00b6\u00b6 392, 394, 396 (CL-0070-ENG) (emphasis added).\n\n*Clayton, Award on Damages,* \u00b6 396 (CL-0070-ENG).\n\n161.\n\nClaimants in this case suggest that the same broad framing would allow them to proceed under DR-CAFTA even if the Tribunal were to adopt the *Clayton* reasoning about reflective loss, because \"[l]ike the claimants in *Clayton,* Claimants here have lost their opportunity to develop the Tambor project,\" which was an opportunity of theirs rather than of Exmingua.183 The Tribunal sees no need at this time to address this alternative theory of a direct rather than an indirect injury, given its ultimate findings regarding interpretation of DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.1(a).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 33.\n\n**(2) Admissibility of Claimants\u2019 \"Unnotified\" MFN Claim**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n162.\n\nRespondent states that Claimants' claim for breach of DR-CAFTA Article 10.4 (Most-Favored-Nation Treatment) must be dismissed because Claimants did not include this alleged breach in their Notice of Intent. In support of this objection, Respondent invokes the ordinary meaning and the object and purpose of DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.2, under a VCLT Article 31 analysis, and prior decisions of certain investment arbitral tribunals.184\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 86-105 and Respondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 121-157.\n\nA. *The characterization of Claimants' MFN claim*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nRespondent points out that Claimants added this claim only in their Notice of Arbitration, where they argued for the first time (as they themselves have admitted) that Exmingua's projects received less favorable treatment than Respondent accorded Escobal, a silver mine operated by the Guatemalan subsidiary of a Canadian company.185 In the Notice of Intent, by contrast, Claimants referred exclusively to their National Treatment claim, arguing that the treatment that Respondent accorded Exmingua\u2019s projects was less favorable than that accorded to \"two projects owned by Guatemalan companies.\"186\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 122.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 126 (quoting from Notice of Intent, \u00b6 3).\n\n164.\n\nAccording to Respondent, this claim must be precluded even if the Tribunal were to accept Claimants\u2019 current argument that the relevant judicial decision which provides the legal and factual basis for their MFN claim is the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling of September 3, 2018 (which post-dated the Notice of Intent), rather than the Supreme Court\u2019s *Escobal* decision of September 2017 (which predated that Notice). This is because, regardless of whether Claimants\u2019 MFN claim is considered an \"additional claim\" under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40, DR-CAFTA prevails over any contrary ICSID Rules, and DR-CAFTA requires Claimants to send a subsequent notice of intent for any new claim, and then allow several months to elapse before bringing such a claim under Article 10.16.3 of DR-CAFTA. Admittedly, Claimants did neither.187\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 52:5-53:16; 57:17-58:14, 178:2-187:11.\n\nB. *The applicable legal standards*\n-----------------------------------\n\n165.\n\n*First,* Respondent asserts that the ordinary meaning of this provision requires a notice of a claim to be given at least 90 days before it may be submitted to arbitration. The notice of intent must provide not merely general information, but must specify, \"for each claim, the provision of [DR-CAFTA]... alleged to have been breached,\" \"the legal and factual basis for each claim,\" and \"the relief sought,\" among other elements. In Respondent\u2019s view, the term \"shall\" in Article 10.16.2 of DR-CAFTA, as opposed to \"may\" or \"should\" in other provisions *(e.g.,* Articles 10.15 and 10.16.1), indicates the DR-CAFTA Parties\u2019 deliberate choice to make the notice of intent mandatory. Further, the term \"each\" means \"every one of two or more people or things, regarded and identified separately.\"188 Recasting the delivery of a notice of intent from a requirement to a discretionary or optional condition would ignore and effectively remove these words, contrary to the principle of *effet utile.* Thus, only the claims properly identified in a notice of intent can be heard by an arbitral tribunal.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 90 (quoting from the definition of \"each\" in Lexico.com, Oxford University Press, https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/each, RL-0030-ENG).\n\n166.\n\nRespondent contends that the \"context\" on which Claimants rely to argue otherwise is of no avail. As explained by the International Law Commission, the rules of interpretation must be applied as mutually reinforcing elements of a holistic exercise.189 If anything, Respondent says, the context of Article 10.16.2 confirms its conclusion. When the State Parties intended to make the fulfillment of a condition discretionary, they used wording such as \"should\" rather than \"shall\", which is used to make compliance mandatory.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 133 (referring to the Draft Articles on the Law of Treaties with Commentaries, adopted by the International Law Commission at its Eighteenth Session, United Nations Conference on the Law of Treaties, A/CONF.39/11/Add.2, Vienna, 26 March \u201324 May 1968 and 9 April \u2013 22 May 1969, p. 39, \u00b6 8, RL-0087-035-ENG).\n\n167.\n\n*Second,* the object and purpose of the notice of intent provision also requires, according to Respondent, the dismissal of the MFN claim. The idea behind this notice requirement is to allow a respondent State to prepare and argue its defense, as the *Aven* tribunal aptly put it.190 It also enables government officials to examine and possibly resolve the dispute through negotiation. Respondent asserts that contrary to Claimants\u2019 allegations, it takes negotiations seriously. However, the negotiations in this case were subject to a confidentiality agreement and it is improper for Claimants to disclose any information concerning them.191 Respondent also argues that the notice requirement serves to promote fairness, efficiency and transparency,192 and these objectives would be frustrated if the requirement is not strictly enforced. So too would other goals set out in the Preamble of DR-CAFTA, such as friendship and cooperation among nations, the development and expansion of world trade and hemispheric integration.193\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 144 (referring to *David R.

Respondent refers to the *Pac Rim* tribunal, which explained that compliance with DR-CAFTA\u2019s Article 10.16.2 notice requirement is mandatory,194 and to the *Aven* tribunal, which declared a belated new claim to be inadmissible *in limine*.195\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 97 (discussing *Pac Rim* \u00b6\u00b6 92-93, RL-0003-054-055).\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 141(discussing *Aven*, \u00b6346) *; see also* Respondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 99.\n\n169.\n\nContrary to Claimants\u2019 allegations, Respondent says, in *Antoine Goetz* and *Burlington,* the tribunals did not dismiss unnotified claims because they were \"unrelated\" to the claims that had been notified; they dismissed them because they were not included in the relevant notices of intent.196 So too did the tribunal in *Supervisi\u00f3n y Control* in respect of a number of unnotified claims, although it admitted others directly linked to the issues that had already been raised.197 In any event, the provision governing notices under DR-CAFTA is stricter than the analogous provision under the Costa Rica-Spain BIT at issue in *Supervisi\u00f3n y Control,* which only required a claimant to give \"[n]otice of any investment-related dispute\" and not of each claim.198 The DR-CAFTA language is also stricter than the applicable investment treaties in *Tulip* and *Salini,* where tribunals adopted a so-called \"flexible approach.\"199\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 148 (discussing *Antoine Goetz et consorts v.

Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n171.\n\nClaimants contend that their MFN claim is admissible under DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.2 or, alternatively, as an ancillary claim under Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. They dispute Respondent\u2019s characterization of this claim and put forward two main arguments relating to the ordinary meaning and the object and purpose of Article 10.16.2. Claimants also discuss several decisions concerning notification of claims.206\n\n*See generally* Claimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 82-103 and Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 91-133.\n\nA. *The characterization of Claimants\u2019 MFN claim*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nClaimants state that Respondent\u2019s objection depends upon a mischaracterization of their MFN claim. The basis for this claim is not the Guatemalan Supreme Court\u2019s decision of September 2017 in the *Escobal* case, which briefly reinstated that project\u2019s mining license, but the Guatemalan Constitutional Court\u2019s decision of September 2018.\n\n173.\n\nClaimants complain that, although Exmingua filed its appeal from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision more than one year before the *Escobal* appeal was filed, the Constitutional Court issued its decision on the *Escobal* appeal on September 3, 2018 (although the decision was to reject the appeal), while Exmingua\u2019s appeal still remains pending.207 It is this disparate treatment that forms the basis for Claimants\u2019 MFN claim. Claimants deny that they \"re-wr[o]te the factual basis for their MFN claim\" in their Counter-Memorial.208\n\n*See also* Tr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 224:1-225:2.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 97 (referencing Respondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 121); *see also* the discussion at Tr-E, December 16, 2019 Hearing, pp. 142:1-143-13.\n\n174.\n\nClaimants explain that they did not reference their MFN claim in the Notice of Intent because the specific facts giving rise to that claim did not exist at the time the Notice was submitted. The same happened in *Pope & Talbot,* yet the tribunal in that case had no problem finding liability in respect of a State measure that was launched more than three months after the claimant filed its notice of intent.209 Moreover, Claimants emphasized that their Notice of Intent already generally discussed Respondent\u2019s discriminatory treatment of Exmingua, as compared with investments owned by others, which forms the basis for both Claimants\u2019 national treatment and MFN claims.210 Both of these are, at bottom, discrimination claims.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 98 (referring to *Pope & Talbot, Award,* \u00b6\u00b6 156, 160-163, 171)\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 99 (referencing the Notice of Intent at 2-3).\n\nB. *The applicable legal standards*\n-----------------------------------\n\n175.\n\n*First,* Claimants submit that the ordinary meaning of Article 10.16.2, in its context, confirms that Claimants\u2019 MFN claim is admissible.211 In their view, this provision does not provide that compliance is a precondition to arbitration; Respondent\u2019s error in concluding the opposite is to focus exclusively on the modal verb \"shall\" in Article 10.16.2, disregarding Article 31 of the VCLT. That provision requires taking into consideration also context and object and purpose. The context here shows that where the State Parties intended to condition the submission of a claim on the satisfaction of certain requirements, they did so expressly. Clear examples can be found in DR-CAFTA Articles 10.18.1, 10.18.2, and 10.18.4.212\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 100 *et seq*.\n\n*See* Claimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 87 (where these provisions are quoted).\n\n176.\n\nAccording to Claimants, the absence of such wording in DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.2 indicates that non-compliance with that provision is not a bar to the admissibility of claims. The tribunal in *B-Mex* confirmed this understanding when interpreting NAFTA Article 1119, which is identical to DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.2 in all relevant respects.213 So did the *ADF* tribunal in that case.214 Contrary to Respondent\u2019s contention, the language in NAFTA Article 1119, requiring inclusion in the notice of intent of \"the provisions of this Agreement alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions,\" means \"all of the provisions alleged to have been breached\" for each of the claims set forth in the notice of intent. Thus, there is no material difference between the applicable NAFTA and DR-CAFTA provisions.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 89 (citing *B-Mex,* \u00b6\u00b6 122-123).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 92 (citing *ADF* \u00b6\u00b6 120, 127.).\n\n177.\n\n*Second,* Claimants assert that their Notice of Intent fulfills the object and purpose of DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.2. Although Respondent has not shown that preparing a defense is an object and purpose of the notification provision, Respondent in any event was not deprived of any opportunity to prepare its defense as a result of the content of Claimants\u2019 Notice of Intent. Claimants are not seeking to advance an entirely separate claim distinct from the measures complained of in their Notice of Intent. The factual basis for their MFN claim all were set forth in Claimants\u2019 Notice of Intent: the alleged arbitrary and discriminatory treatment by the Guatemalan courts and the MEM, by allowing other projects to continue operating while the MEM conducted consultations; by ruling on appeals in other cases filed long after Exmingua\u2019s; and by commencing and concluding consultations in other cases.215 Respondent thus had sufficient information and ample opportunity and time to pursue amicable settlement discussions with Claimants, who even traveled to Guatemala to meet in person with Respondent\u2019s representatives. There was nothing stopping Respondent from pursuing settlement discussions in the eight months between Claimants\u2019 filing of their Notice of Arbitration and the constitution of the Tribunal, or indeed to this day.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 101 (citing Notice of Intent at 2-3).\n\n178.\n\nClaimants state that furthermore, DR-CAFTA\u2019s object and purpose of promoting the efficient resolution of disputes would be wholly thwarted by Respondent\u2019s interpretation. If, as Respondent pleads, Claimants\u2019 MFN claim were to be dismissed, Claimants would be entitled to re-submit that claim to arbitration, by filing a new notice of intent to include that single claim, waiting three months, and then filing a new notice of arbitration, all before seeking to consolidate that new claim with this one. In Claimants\u2019 view, no purpose would be served by requiring them to go through these extra steps.\n\n179.\n\n*Third,* Claimants maintain that their position is also consistent with the jurisprudence. Where a notice provision\u2019s object and purpose of apprising the respondent of the dispute and granting time for attempts at a settlement already have been satisfied, tribunals properly have refused to dismiss claims on account of a defect in the notice. That happened in *B-Mex* and *Al-Bahloul,* to name a few.216 Claimants also argue that tribunals have also taken a pragmatic approach by admitting unnotified claims where no prejudice to the respondent\u2019s ability to react has been shown; *Chemtura* and *ADF* are good examples of this.217\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 94-95 (citing *B-Mex,* \u00b6 132 ; *Al-Bahloul* \u00b6 154).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 99-100 (citing *Chemtura,* \u00b6\u00b6 92, 103-104; *ADF,* \u00b6 138).\n\n180.\n\nAccording to Claimants, none of the cases on which Respondent relies indicates otherwise or supports the consequence which Respondent seeks to impose on Claimants. The *Pac Rim* tribunal did not even consider the effect of non-compliance with a notice requirement, whereas the decisions in *Tulip v. Turkey*, *Salini v. Morocco* and *Ethyl v. Canada* adopted a flexible approach to the notice provisions in the applicable BITs, finding claimants\u2019 claims to be admissible despite not employing the \"most perfect forms\" of notification.218 On the other hand, in *Supervision y Control, Goetz, Burlington* and *Rurelec*219 the new claims were largely unrelated to the claims that had been notified, which is not the case here.220 As for *Aven,* Claimants argue that the tribunal there did not engage with the ordinary meaning of DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.2, but rather found a late-raised claim to be inadmissible because the claimants only raised that claim at the end of the merits hearing (notwithstanding some passing references in their memorial), a situation far from that which exists here.221\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 115-120 (referring to *Ethyl Corp. v.

Although they deny having made any amendment, Claimants argue that the last sentence of DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.14 presupposes that there may be amendments to claims. There are also other provisions of DR-CAFTA, particularly, Articles 10.20.4(a) and (c), which indicate that the Notice of Arbitration may be amended. Moreover, DR-CAFTA incorporates by reference the applicable arbitration rules, and ICSID Arbitration Rule 40 allows amendments as well as ancillary incidental claims.222\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 225:3-226:6.\n\n182.\n\nClaimants state that their MFN claim complies with all requirements in this respect. The claim arises directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute in these proceedings, since it involves Respondent\u2019s alleged discriminatory treatment of Claimants\u2019 investment as compared to those of other investors. As explained by the *CMS v. Argentina* tribunal, the test is whether a close factual connection exists between the new and older claims, to require adjudication of the new claim in order to achieve the final settlement of the dispute.223 That test is satisfied here, Claimants say. Claimants also emphasize that they raised their MFN claim in their Notice of Arbitration, which is well before Rule 40\u2019s deadline of the submission of their Reply. Claimants\u2019 MFN claim is likewise within the scope of the Parties\u2019 consent and the jurisdiction of the Centre, as required by ICSID Arbitration Rule 40. In their view, this provision of the Arbitration Rules applies along with the notification requirement of DR-CAFTA Article 10.16.2, and is not displaced by the latter. The *Metalclad v. Mexico* tribunal confirmed this interpretation, they say, when it considered the applicability of Article 48 of the 1978 ICSID Additional Facility Rules (equivalent to Article 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules) in the context of NAFTA Articles 1119 and 1120.224\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 129 (referring *CMS Gas Transmission Co. v.

The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\nA. *Preliminary Observations*\n-----------------------------\n\n183.\n\nThe Tribunal begins its analysis of this Objection, as it did for Respondent\u2019s first Objection, with a few preliminary observations.\n\n184.\n\nFirst, Claimants\u2019 contention that their Notice of Intent already \"set forth the essential facts and legal basis for their MFN claim\"225 cannot be sustained. The Notice of Intent had two sections relevant to this issue, one entitled \"Factual Basis for the Claim\" and the other entitled \"Breach of Obligations Under the Treaty.\" In the former, Claimants made the general allegation that \"the Guatemalan courts notably have failed to rule in a consistent fashion when compared with other cases,\" but while the phrase \"other cases\" was framed in the plural, the Notice of Intent identified only one example of alleged discrimination, described as involving \"two projects owned by Guatemala companies.\"226 No allegation was made regarding more favorable treatment of investors of any third State, as would be necessary to set forth the basis for an MFN claim. The following section confirmed this understanding, stating that \"Guatemala\u2019s actions violate the following provisions of the DR-CAFTA\" and listing \"Article 10.3 - National Treatment,\" but not Article 10.4 on \"Most-Favored-Nation Treatment.\"227 In these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot accept Claimants\u2019 contention that \"[t]he factual basis for Claimants\u2019 MFN claim... was set out in Claimants\u2019 Notice of Intent....\"228 A \"factual basis\" necessarily requires an allegation of fact, and there are no facts alleged in the Notice of Intent that would suggest an MFN claim (as opposed to a National Treatment claim) was being noticed for eventual submission to arbitration.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 83.\n\nNotice of Intent, p. 3, C-5.\n\nNotice of Intent, pp. 3-4, C-5.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 109.\n\n185.\n\nHowever, the Tribunal accepts Claimants\u2019 alternative point that a reference to the MFN claim could not have been included in the Notice of Intent, because the particular act that Claimants later challenged as an Article 10.4 breach had not yet occurred. The Notice of Intent was dated 16 May 2018, but according to Claimants\u2019 later Notice of Arbitration, the alleged MFN breach arose from a 3 September 2018 ruling of Guatemala\u2019s Constitutional Court in the *Escobal* case, involving a project indirectly owned by a Canadian investor.229 Respondent is correct that the relevant paragraph of the Notice of Arbitration (again in a section entitled \"Factual Basis for Claimants\u2019 Claims\") also mentioned a September 2017 Supreme Court ruling concerning Escobal\u2019s mining license, but a close reading of the paragraph, particularly in the context of the preceding paragraph, makes clear that Claimants\u2019 complaint was focused on the Constitutional Court decision.230 The focus on the Constitutional Court was further clarified in the following section, entitled \"Breach of Obligations Under the DR-CAFTA,\" which alleged breach of Articles 10.3 and 10.4 by reference respectively to the Constitutional Court\u2019s resolution of the *Oxec* and *Escobal* appeals, with no mention of any earlier lower court rulings in either case.231\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 63.\n\nThe prior paragraph compared the Constitutional Court's prompt decision in the *Oxec* case (involving the Guatemalan-owned projects) with the absence of any Constitutional Court decision in Exmingua's case. Notice of Arbitration \u00b6 62. This led directly to the statement, \"Apart from the *Oxec* case, *the Court* also has taken action in the *Escobal* case, although that case was filed significantly later than Exmingua's case.\" *Id.* \u00b6 63 (emphasis added). The reference to \"the Court\" in context of the prior paragraph clearly referred to the Constitutional Court. The paragraph then provided some history of how the *Escobal* case came to be before the Constitutional Court (including a reference to the earlier Supreme Court decision), but it closed again with a comparison between the *Escobal* Constitutional Court ruling and the lack of any ruling in Exmingua's case. *Id.* \u00b6 63 (\"This final ruling was rendered even though the *Escobal* appeal was filed more than one year after Exmingua filed its appeal with the Constitutional Court, which the court has failed to act upon.\").\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 68.\n\n186.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal rejects Respondent\u2019s protest that Claimants \"now attempt to re-write the factual basis for their MFN claim\" in response to the Preliminary objections, by \"ignor[ing]\" their prior reference to the *Escobal* Supreme Court ruling and \"only focus[ing] on\" the Constitutional Court ruling.232 A proper reading of Notice of Arbitration confirms that the MFN claim always focused on the Constitutional Court ruling. Since that ruling post-dated Claimants\u2019 submission of the Notice of Intent, by definition the Notice of Intent could not have included the MFN claim. No issue of a deliberate or negligent omission therefore arises.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 121, 123.\n\n187.\n\nIn consequence of these findings, the Preliminary Objection presents a fairly narrow question. The Tribunal need not decide whether DR-CAFTA prevents a claimant from raising in an arbitration additional claims that it *could* have included in its original notice of intent, but for whatever reason did not originally include. The only \"new claim\" in this case concerns a complaint about State action occurring *after* the issuance of the Notice of Intent. Nor does this case involve issues of tardiness, where a claimant sat on its rights for a substantial period in the arbitration, seeking to add a new claim only late in the proceedings. Claimants to the contrary pleaded their MFN claim in their 9 November 2018 Notice of Arbitration, which was filed just two months after the *Escobal* Constitutional Court decision which is the subject of that claim.\n\n188.\n\nAccordingly, the Objection to Claimants\u2019 MFN claim concerns a narrow issue only. The question is whether DR-CAFTA bars a claimant from including in its notice of arbitration a claim about *new* State conduct, occurring after a prior notice of intent, without first issuing a second notice of intent and then waiting for a second consultation or cooling-off period to expire. The Tribunal focuses below on this particular question, which is somewhat distinct from the fact pattern arising in certain other cases the Parties have invoked in their respective pleadings.\n\nB. *Interpretation of Article 10.16.2*\n--------------------------------------\n\n189.\n\nOnce again, the question presented should be resolved by VCLT interpretation, through assessment of the ordinary meaning of the relevant DR-CAFTA provision, in the context in which it occurs and in light of the Treaty's object and purpose.233\n\nVCLT, Article 31(1).\n\n190.\n\nArticle 10.16.2 provides in relevant part as follows:\n\nAt least 90 days before submitting *any claim* to arbitration under this Section, a claimant *shall deliver* to the respondent a written notice of its intention to submit *the claim* to arbitration (\"notice of intent\"). The notice *shall specify:...*\n\n(b) for *each claim,* the provision of this Agreement... alleged to have been breached and any other relevant provisions;\n\n(c) the legal and factual basis for *each claim;...* .234\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.16.2 (CL-0001-ENG) (emphasis added).\n\n191.\n\nThe first observation is that the reference to delivery of a prior notice of intent applies to the submission of \"any claim,\" and the specifications for the notice are framed as applying \"for each claim.\" The second observation is that each of the two relevant sentences uses the phrase \"shall\" (as in \"shall deliver\" and \"shall specify\"), which commonly denotes a requirement rather than a mere recommendation. The combination of these two elements makes clear that a notice of intent is required to initiate an arbitration, and that a claimant must include in that notice a reference to all then-intended claims. The notice is not characterized as a merely illustrative document, articulating some subset of known claims while omitting others, but rather as a mandatory precondition, requiring advance provision of information regarding all claims that the claimant intends to submit to arbitration. The Tribunal does not accept Claimants' suggestion that because Article 10.16.2 does not specify a consequence for failure to abide by its terms, the provision is thereby rendered somehow discretionary. To the contrary, it must be given meaning, and the obvious meaning is that a claimant may not proceed directly to a notice of arbitration, without first giving a respondent the notice required with respect to each of the claimant's intended claims.\n\n192.\n\nArticle 10.16.2 does not on its face discuss what happens later, *after* submission of a claim to arbitration, in the event that a claimant considers new developments to warrant submission of new claims. Nonetheless, if this were the only relevant provision in DR-CAFTA, the Tribunal could understand the basis for a strict reading that would require submission of a new notice of intent prior to submission of additional claims.\n\n193.\n\nHowever, as with any treaty provision, Article 10.16.2 must be interpreted in the context of surrounding and related Treaty provisions. In this case, there are several other provisions of DR-CAFTA which expressly allude to claim *amendments,* after an initial claim or set of claims has been submitted to arbitration.\n\n194.\n\nThe first such provision is two paragraphs later, within the same general Article 10.16 on \"Submission of a Claim to Arbitration.\" Article 10.16.4, which addresses the date on which a given claim \"shall be deemed submitted to arbitration,\" is divided structurally into two sentences. The first sentence refers to claims included in the claimant\u2019s notice of arbitration, which are deemed submitted based on the relevant arbitration rules the claimant invoked (the ICSID Convention, the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, or the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules). The second sentence addresses the submission date of *subsequent* claims, and states that \"[a] claim *asserted for the first time after such notice of arbitration* is submitted shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this Section on the date of its receipt under the applicable arbitral rules.\"235 By its plain terms, this provision expressly contemplates the assertion of additional claims after the filing of a notice of arbitration, and it does so without suggesting that such assertion is preconditioned on a *renvoi* to the prior Article 10.16.2, *i.e.,* to a prerequisite of filing of a second notice of intent and exhausting a second waiting period, before filing a second (or amended) notice of arbitration. Indeed, the only reference to a notice of arbitration in Article 10.16.4 is to the *original* notice of arbitration, predating the assertion of the new claim. The absence of any mention of a second notice of arbitration applicable to this circumstance is significant, because it seems to suggest that the assertion of the new claim is through a separate process (not governed by Article 10.16.2) from the one applied to the original initiation of the case.\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.16.4 (CL-0001-ENG) (emphasis added).\n\n195.\n\nIn other words, Article 10.16 must be read as a whole, in such a way as to give meaning both to its subparagraph 2 (Article 10.16.2) and to its subparagraph 4 (Article 10.16.4). Read together, the Article seems to establish requirements for *initiating* an arbitration, defined to require prior identification of all then-intended claims through a notice of intent, but it also expressly allows for the possibility that an additional claim may be \"asserted for the first time after such notice of arbitration,\" without requiring a repetition of the notice of intent and notice of arbitration process.\n\n196.\n\nThis reading is reinforced by two paragraphs of the subsequent Article 10.20.4, which authorizes the filing of preliminary objections that \"as a matter of law, a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award... may be made.\" Article 10.20.4(a), which regulates the deadline for filing preliminary objections, calculates those deadlines based on the possibility of two different categories of claims: those submitted in the original notice of arbitration, and those applicable \"in the case of *an amendment to the notice of arbitration.* \"236 Article 10.20.4(c) likewise refers to amendments, stating that \"the tribunal shall assume to be true claimant\u2019s factual allegations in support of any claim in the notice of arbitration (or *any amendment thereof)*....\"237 Yet nothing in the Treaty text conditions the amendment process - resulting in the assertion of a new claim - on a prior return to the notice of intent stage of Article 10.16.2. And of course, it would be nonsensical to allow new claims to be added *after* the Notice of Arbitration more easily than *within* the Notice of Arbitration itself.\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.20.4(a) (CL-0001-ENG) (emphasis added).\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.20.4(c) (CL-0001-ENG) (emphasis added).\n\n197.\n\nIt is equally relevant that in both of these DR-CAFTA provisions - Article 10.16.4, referring to a \"claim asserted for the first time after\" the notice of arbitration, and Article 10.20.4, referring to an \"amendment\" of the notice of arbitration - there are cross-references to the applicable arbitration rules. DR-CAFTA was clearly prepared with knowledge of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the ICSID Additional Facility Rules and the UNCITRAL Rules, and nothing in the Treaty text suggests an intent to displace those rules with respect to the admissibility of additional claims. In the case of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the relevant rule is Rule 40, which addresses in its three subparagraphs the substantive, temporal and procedural requirements for asserting \"an incidental or additional claim,\" also referred to as an ancillary claim.238 In this case, Respondent has not suggested that any of these requirements independently would bar admission of Claimants\u2019 MFN claim. Its suggestion rather is that Claimants cannot even reach analysis under the ICSID Rules, because DR-CAFTA supplants that analysis by providing its own overarching requirement of a prior notice of intent before any new claim may be submitted to arbitration. The Tribunal is unable to accept that proposition, given the express references in DR-CAFTA to assertion of new claims and amendments to the notice of arbitration, as well as the express references *inter alia* to the ICSID Rules in the same Treaty provisions.\n\nWith respect to substantive requirements, ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(1) permits presentation of \"an incidental or additional claim \u2026 arising directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.\" With respect to temporal requirements, Rule 40(2) requires that an additional claim \"be presented not later than in the Reply \u2026, unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.\" Finally, with respect to procedure, Rule 40(3) requires a tribunal permitting an additional claim to provide an opportunity for the responding party to file written observations on that claim.\n\n198.\n\nFinally, this reading of the relevant DR-CAFTA provisions, in their appropriate context, would not override the object and purpose of requiring a notice of intent or a waiting period before a claimant may initiate arbitration proceedings. The Tribunal accepts that there are several purposes of such requirements, including to enable the respondent State to investigate the claim, conduct such dispute settlement negotiations as it considers appropriate, and to take initial steps to organize its defense prior to the proceedings getting underway. Once an arbitration has commenced, the addition of an ancillary claim does not significantly prejudice these objectives, provided that the claim is related to the existing dispute and is added early enough in the proceedings that the State will have appropriate opportunity to investigate, discuss and respond. These are precisely the objectives that ICSID Arbitration Rule 40 seeks to safeguard. Where, as here, the new claim is added at the *earliest possible moment* in the arbitration process - in the Notice of Arbitration commencing the proceedings themselves, and shortly after the new event complained of -the Tribunal does not see real prejudice, much less such severe prejudice as to outweigh its contextual reading of the DR-CAFTA as allowing new claims in these circumstances.\n\n199.\n\nFinally, the Tribunal notes that Respondent\u2019s contrary reading of DR-CAFTA - which would require a claimant to recommence the notice of intent and waiting period process with respect to any new State conduct after its original notice of intent, before it could present any claim in the proceedings regarding that subsequent conduct - would provide potential for disruption and duplication, as well as potential for mischief. Given the reality of procedural timetables, it would be very difficult to complete briefing on any new claim in time to be heard together with the original claims. This effectively would result in a choice between either (a) requesting the existing tribunal to suspend or elongate the procedural timetable, to allow the new claim to catch up, or (b) filing a new arbitration to address the new claim, so as not to delay resolution of the original claims - even though the old and new claims may be closely related and it would be more sensible for them to be resolved together by a single tribunal. Nothing in DR-CAFTA, which expressly envisions the filing of additional and amended claims even *after* a notice of arbitration *(i.e.,* later in the proceedings than occurred here) appears to mandate such an improbable and awkward result.\n\n**(3) Timeliness of Claimants\u2019 lack of full protection and security Claim**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**a. Respondent\u2019s Position**\n----------------------------\n\n200.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants\u2019 claim for lack of full protection and security should be dismissed because it is time-barred and therefore outside the scope of consent to the Tribunal\u2019s jurisdiction, pursuant to the three-year statute of limitations contained in DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1.239 In its Reply, Respondent further contends that Claimants have attempted to re-write this claim in response to its objections, and reiterates that the law requires dismissal of this claim.240\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 106-140.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 158-183.\n\nA. *The characterization of Claimants\u2019 full protection and security claim*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n201.\n\nAccording to Respondent, Claimants\u2019 Notice of Arbitration reveals that Claimants first acquired knowledge in 2012 of Guatemala\u2019s alleged failure to respond to the \"continuous and systematic protests and blockades\" of their investment and related losses.241 However, they did not file this claim until November 9, 2018, long after the three-year limitation period had expired. Pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1, Respondent argues, any claim arising from events before the critical date of November 9, 2015 is time barred. Respondent refers to the *Berkowitz* tribunal for the proposition that first appreciation of loss or damage triggers the limitation period under DR-CAFTA; knowledge of the full extent or quantification of the loss or damage is not required.242 Here, Respondent argues, Claimants should at the very least be charged with constructive knowledge dating back to 2012.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 118, 124, 128 (quoting from Claimants' Notice of Arbitration \u00b6 121).\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 111 (relying on *Aaron C. Berkowitz, Brett E. Berkowitz and Trevor B. Berkowitz (formerly Spence International Investments and others) v. Republic of Costa Rica*, Case No. UNCT/13/2, Interim Award (Corrected), 30 May 2017, (hereinafter \"*Berkowitz*\") \u00b6 213, RL-0038-137).\n\n202.\n\nRespondent says that Claimants have attempted to rewrite their full protection and security claim, alleging now that there was a \"new wave of protests\" that began in 2016,243 and supplementing their prior claim with new (and contradictory) factual allegations and thirteen exhibits related to the 2016 and 2017 events. Respondent emphasizes that the Notice of Arbitration by contrast did not distinguish between pre-2016 protests and the protests that occurred in 2016 and thereafter.244\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 158 (quoting from Claimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 121).\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 158-164 (discussing the purported changes in Claimants' asserted factual basis for its full protection and security claim).\n\n203.\n\nRespondent also contends that Claimants\u2019 characterization of the alleged breach as \"continuing\" does not allow them to escape the three-year time limit for submission of a claim to arbitration. Even assuming *arguendo* that the alleged \"new wave of protests in early 2016\" amounts to a distinct breach of the full protection and security standard, and that Claimants only seek damages arising from the post-2015 events, the limitation period under DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 still applies. In Respondent\u2019s view, a \"continuing breach\" does not renew the limitation period, nor does it change the date when Claimants first acquired the relevant knowledge. Claimants cannot base their claim \"on the most recent transgression\" of a \"series of similar and related actions\" by Respondent to circumvent this restriction, as the *Corona* tribunal aptly noted.245\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 162 (quoting *Corona*, \u00b6\u00b6 214-215 (citing *Grand River*, \u00b6 81, RL-0002-ENG/SPA).\n\nB. *The applicable legal standards*\n-----------------------------------\n\n204.\n\nIn support of this objection, Respondent relies on the jurisprudence of DR-CAFTA tribunals, the subsequent practice of the DR-CAFTA Parties under VCLT Article 31(3)(b), and the ordinary meaning, context, object and purpose of DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1.\n\n205.\n\n*First,* Respondent states that DR-CAFTA tribunals have consistently held that the running of the three-year statute of limitations is to be calculated from the \"first\" acquisition of the relevant knowledge, not subsequent or ultimate acquisition of such knowledge. The *Berkowitz* and *Corona* cases are good examples of this.246 As noted by the former tribunal, it is immaterial whether claimants\u2019 allegations \"are cast in terms of post-limitation period conduct by Respondent or in terms of continuing violations.\"247\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 131-132 and Respondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 172-173, 179 (citing *Berkowitz*, \u00b6 208; *Corona*, \u00b6\u00b6 198, 215).\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 173 (citing *Berkowitz*, *Award,* \u00b6\u00b6 251-252).\n\n206.\n\nRespondent submits that Claimants, by contrast, place too much emphasis on a single case issued more than twelve years ago, *UPS*, which has not been followed by a line of subsequent NAFTA and DR-CAFTA decisions (including *Berkowitz* and *Corona*), and also has been criticized by scholars.248 Nor in Respondent\u2019s view does *Feldman* support the *UPS* tribunal\u2019s interpretation. The *Feldman* tribunal analyzed only whether the lack of jurisdiction over actions pre-dating NAFTA\u2019s entry into force also precluded jurisdiction over the part of a continuing course of action that occurred after entry into force; the tribunal did not deal with a course of action that both began and continued after NAFTA\u2019s entry into force.249\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 179-180 (citing *Berkowitz*, *Award,* \u00b6 208; *Corona*, *Award,* \u00b6 215).\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6\u00b6 181-182 (discussing *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Interim Decision on Preliminary Jurisdictional Issues, 6 December 2000, \u00b6 62, CL-0094-ENG).\n\n207.\n\nRespondent also contends that Claimants rely on awards which they either misinterpret or misapply. In *Grand River,* for instance, the tribunal rejected claimant\u2019s position that there were several limitations periods at issue, and found that certain \"complementary legislation\" and amendments to the existing laws adopted after the critical date could be challenged. The *Grand River* tribunal paid particular attention to whether these measures \"were clearly identified as included in the claim in the Notice of Arbitration and the Particularized Statement of Claim,\" which is clearly not the case here.250 Respondent argues that Claimants also ignore *Ansung*, which confirms that different limitation periods cannot be applied to Respondent\u2019s alleged pre-2016 and post-2015 alleged omissions. The tribunal in that case accepted that \"damages for [a continuing omission] [...] may be measured from different times after the first incident of that omission,\" but found that neither respondent\u2019s \"continued inaction\" after the critical date nor the claimant\u2019s final liquidation of its damages restarted the limitation period.251 The other decisions Claimants cite, such as *Eli Lilly, Mobil,* and *Nissan,* are equally inapposite in Respondent\u2019s view.252 This is not a case where Claimants point to certain measures as background facts, or where the breach did not crystallize until after the critical date. Nor, Respondent argues, is case law from the European Court of Human Rights, upon which Claimants rely, of any help for this case. International human rights jurisprudence does not have any bearing on the jurisdiction of an investor-state arbitral tribunal.253\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 169 (quoting *Grand River v.

For instance, in *Corona,* the United States argued in its non-disputing State Party submission that \"Article 10.18.1 refers to knowledge of the alleged breach and loss first acquired as of a particular 'date.\u2019 Such knowledge cannot be acquired at multiple points in time or on a recurring basis.\"254 The United States put forth the same argument in *Berkowitz,* and the Dominican Republic has also endorsed this same interpretation.255\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 133 (referring to *Corona*, Submission of the United States of America, 11 March 2016, \u00b6\u00b6 3-5, RL-0042-ENG).\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 134-135 (referring to *Berkowitz*, Submission of the United States of America, 17 April 2015, \u00b6\u00b6 4-7, RL-0043-002-002).\n\n209.\n\n*Finally,* Respondent argues that allowing Claimants to evade the three-year limitation period by basing its claim on the most recent alleged transgression in a series of similar and related actions would run counter to VLCT rules of interpretation, and would effectively deprive the limitation clause of its essential purpose, namely to \"draw a line under the prosecution of historic claims,\" as the *Berkowitz* and *Corona* tribunals rightly noted.256 Allowing claims such as this to be asserted would also, Respondent contends, result in uncertainty and instability, which does not comport with the objectives of DR-CAFTA.\n\nRespondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 179 and Respondent's Preliminary Objections Memorial \u00b6 138 (quoting *Berkowitz,* \u00b6 208*.*).\n\n**b. Claimants\u2019 Position**\n--------------------------\n\n210.\n\nClaimants submit that their claim for lack of full protection is timely. They argue that Respondent misconstrues the nature of their claim and misstates the law to support its objection.257 Moreover, Claimants contend that, even if Respondent were correct that the relevant protests began in 2012, the claim still would not be time-barred, because the prescription period only begins to run from the date a continuous breach ceases, not from when it commences.\n\nSee Claimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 134 *et seq.* and Claimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 104 *et seq*.\n\nA. *The characterization of Claimants\u2019 full protection and security claim*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nAccording to Claimants, their full protection and security claim is not based on a single continuing breach, nor does it arise out of events that occurred in 2012. Rather, this claim concerns Respondent\u2019s specific failure to provide full protection and security in connection with protests and blockades that erupted in early 2016, nearly two years after operations had commenced at Progresso VII, following the Guatemalan Supreme Court\u2019s decision on 11 November 2015 to grant an *amparo* against the MEM.258 Claimants therefore did not acquire knowledge of Respondent\u2019s breach and their resulting damage until early 2016. This new wave of protests and blockades, and Respondent\u2019s associated failure to provide full protection and security, prevented Exmingua from carrying out the social consultations and completing the EIA for Santa Margarita, in furtherance of its application for an exploitation license.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 116.\n\n212.\n\nClaimants maintain that the Notice of Arbitration\u2019s description of the 2012 protests and Guatemala\u2019s associated failure to protect Claimants\u2019 investment was provided for factual background, and not as an element of their claim. They emphasize that, although the 2012 protests delayed the start of exploitation activities at the *Progreso VII* site for more than two years, Claimants have not alleged and are not alleging any breach and are not seeking any damages in respect of that delay. The protests and blockades that started in 2012 ended in 2014, following Respondent\u2019s intervention, which is an undisputed fact.259 Moreover, the use of the word \"continuous\" in the Notice of Arbitration, upon which Respondent has placed a great deal of emphasis, was intended merely to show the ongoing nature of the blockades while they lasted.260 In any event, should the Tribunal consider there is anything unclear concerning the timing of these different protests, that would be for the merits phase.261\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 218:10-220:8.\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, p. 130:11-15.\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 130:16-132:6.\n\n213.\n\nClaimants state that the loss or damage for which they assert a full protection and security claim is the loss of an opportunity to obtain an exploitation license for the *Santa Margarita Project,* as a result of the new wave of protests that occurred in early 2016 and Respondent\u2019s failure to intervene. Claimants are not seeking full protection and security damages in relation to Progreso VII, because Exmingua was already prohibited from engaging in mining activities there as a result of the Supreme Court\u2019s amparo ruling and the MEM\u2019s suspension order. Claimants thus did not suffer any additional or distinct loss or damage as a consequence of Respondent\u2019s full protection and security breach in connection with the Progreso VII project. The relevant damages for that project already were suffered as a result of Respondent\u2019s breaches in arbitrarily and unlawfully suspending Exmingua\u2019s exploitation license for Progreso VII.262\n\nTr-E, 16 December 2019 Hearing, pp. 216:14-217:14.\n\n214.\n\nClaimants further state that the factual exhibits they submitted with their Counter-Memorial simply confirm the facts set forth in their earlier Notice of Arbitration and provide context to the factual allegations underlying their claim.263 In any event, the Tribunal is empowered to consider facts beyond those set forth in Claimants\u2019 Notice of Arbitration, because DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c) does not apply to Respondent\u2019s objection as to the timeliness of Claimants\u2019 full protection and security claim.264\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 143.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 144.\n\nB. *The applicable legal standards*\n-----------------------------------\n\n215.\n\nClaimants assert that Respondent misstates the provisions and rulings upon which it seeks to rely.\n\n216.\n\n*First,* Claimants consider that for purposes of assessing the timeliness of a claim, it is \"possible and appropriate... to separate a series of events into distinct components...,\" as the *Clayton v. Canada* tribunal found.265 That was also the approach adopted by the tribunal in *Grand River,* a case which (contrary to Respondent\u2019s assertion) does not contradict Claimants\u2019 position in this case.266 That is because this case does not involve a situation relating to the \"implementation\" of a pre-critical date measure; instead, in early 2016 there were new protests and a new blockade, triggered by a new event. Nor do Respondent\u2019s other cases - namely *Corona, Berkowitz* and *Ansung* - detract from this conclusion.267 Unlike this case, those cases involved a singular measure which gave rise to a breach and damage outside of the limitations period. The additional conduct or inaction upon which the claimants sought to rely after the cut-off date did not result in new damage or loss to the claimants, separate from the loss that it had already incurred.268 The situation is entirely different in this case, Claimants contend.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 107 (quoting *Clayton, Award on Jurisdiction,* \u00b6\u00b6 266-269).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 146 (quoting *Grand River,* \u00b6\u00b6 86-87).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 107 (citing *Grand River*, \u00b6 81).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 149-150.\n\n217.\n\n*Second,* Claimants assert that tribunals can take into account pre-critical date measures as factual background and context, without running afoul of the Treaty\u2019s limitation period. The awards in *Eli Lilly* and *Mondev* confirmed this.269 Moreover, contrary to Respondent\u2019s suggestion, there is no requirement under the DR-CAFTA for Claimants to designate certain facts in their Notice of Arbitration as \"background facts.\"270 In any event, in their submissions in response to Respondent\u2019s Preliminary Objections, Claimants have clarified the factual basis for their full protection and security claim, and the background facts that the Tribunal may consider in determining their claim.271\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 109 (citing *Eli Lilly*, \u00b6 172, *Mondev*, \u00b670).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 151 (referencing Respondent's Preliminary Objections Reply \u00b6 174).\n\n*Id*.\n\n218.\n\n*Third,* Claimants submit that the DR-CAFTA prescription period does not begin to run until a claimant has first acquired (or should have acquired) knowledge of the loss or damage suffered as a consequence of the specific measure which it alleges constitutes the breach. As the tribunals in *Mobil, UPS* and *Nissan* explained, knowledge entails more than just a suspicion, and a continuing course of conduct may well generate losses of different dimensions at different times.272 Thus, the tribunals found that claimants\u2019 claims had crystallized within the applicable limitation periods. Furthermore, and contrary to Respondent\u2019s contention, the NAFTA Parties have not disregarded *UPS*\u2019s interpretation by subsequent practice. In any event, Respondent has failed to demonstrate that the subsequent practice of all of the DR-CAFTA Parties (which extend beyond the NAFTA Parties) establishes an agreement regarding the interpretation of DR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1.273\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6\u00b6 110-112 (citing *Mobil*, \u00b6 155; *UPS,* \u00b6 30; and *Nissan*, \u00b6\u00b6 57, 285, 329).\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Rejoinder \u00b6 155.\n\n219.\n\n*Finally,* Claimants argue that even if the Tribunal were to consider that the relevant breach for which they claim loss and damage was a continuous breach which began in 2012, Claimants\u2019 claim still would not be time-barred, because the limitations period was renewed by the continuing breaches that occurred in 2016 and thereafter.274 Claimants refer to the Award in *UPS* that \"continuing courses of conduct constitute breaches of legal obligations and renew the limitation period accordingly.\"275 This is consistent with the decision in *Feldman v. Mexico,* where the tribunal acknowledged under this logic the claimant\u2019s claim for lost profits after NAFTA's entry into force, even though the claim related to measures Mexico had adopted before NAFTA\u2019s entry into force.276 It is also in line with other sources of international law as reflected in the European Commission on Human Rights\u2019 decision in *Agrotexim v. Greece,* where the Commission stated that in a \"continuing situation,\" any time limit \"runs from the termination of the situation concerned.\"277\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 128.\n\nClaimants' Preliminary Objections Counter-Memorial \u00b6 113 (quoting *UPS,* \u00b6 28)\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 114 (quoting *Marvin Roy Feldman Karpa v. United Mexican States*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, Award on the Merits, 16 December 2002, \u00b6 199, CL-0093-ENG/SPA)\n\n*Id.* \u00b6 115 (quoting *Agrotexim Hellas S.A. and Others v. Greece*, Commission decision dated 12 February 1992, DR 72, at 5, 9 CL-0095-ENG)\n\n**c. The Tribunal\u2019s Analysis**\n------------------------------\n\n220.\n\nRespondent\u2019s third objection is presented under DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5, which envisions an expedited decision on objections that \"the dispute is not within the tribunal\u2019s competence.\"278 Unlike objections under Article 10.20.4, jurisdictional objections do not require a tribunal to assume as true all facts alleged in the notice of arbitration.279 Nonetheless, just as an Article 10.20.4 objection requires a threshold determination of *what claim was actually submitted*, in order to determine whether \"a claim submitted is not a claim for which an award in favor of the claimant made be made,\"280 Respondent\u2019s particular Article 10.20.5 objection requires a similar threshold determination. That is because, under Article 10.18.1, the time-limitation provision that Respondent invokes as the basis for its jurisdictional objection, the relevant inquiry is whether \"more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of *the breach alleged* under Article 10.16.1 and knowledge that the claimant... has incurred loss or damage\" by reason of that breach.281 This determination cannot be made without a predicate determination of *what particular breach has been alleged*.\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5 (CL-0001-ENG); *see* Respondent's chart reproduced in \u00b6 55 above (invoking Article 10.20.5).\n\n*Cf.* DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.4(c) (CL-0001-ENG).\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.20.4 (CL-0001-ENG); *see supra* Section V.1.c (discussing the need to determine what claim was submitted).\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 (CL-0001-ENG) (emphasis added)\n\n221.\n\nIn making the latter determination, a tribunal necessarily starts with the operative pleading setting out the allegations *(i.e.,* the notice of arbitration). But as discussed in Section V.l.c above, in the context of Article 10.20.4, this does not mean that, in the event of an ambiguity in that document, a tribunal must ignore subsequent clarifications as to what breaches *actually* are being alleged and in fact pursued. It would make no sense for a tribunal to determine its jurisdiction over a putative breach that a claimant insists it has not alleged or in any event is not pursuing.\n\n222.\n\nThat point takes on importance here, because Respondent\u2019s time-bar objection in large part appears aimed at an alleged full protection and security breach that Claimants insist they are not actually claiming, or at least are no longer pursuing. Respondent points to certain language in Claimants\u2019 Notice of Arbitration which refers to popular protests and blockades in 2012 that prevented access to Exmingua\u2019s Progreso VII Project, and correctly notes Claimants\u2019 statement with respect to those events that \"KCA and Exmingua sought assistance from various local and national government authorities, but the State failed to take meaningful or effective action to stop the ongoing, unlawful blockage of the Progreso VII Project.\"282 Claimants, however, point to subsequent passages in the Notice of Arbitration which state that following the grant of an *amparo* in Exmingua\u2019s favor, \"on May 2014, the exploitation activities at Progreso VII resumed, and by year-end, Exmingua made its first concentrate shipment.\"283 While Claimants noted that \"[i]rregular blockades continued, however, without effective responses from the State,\"284 a key word here is \"irregular,\" which does not imply a breadth or constancy as to shut down operations. To the contrary, the Notice of Arbitration indicates that operations continued at the Progreso VII Project until the Guatemalan Supreme Court granted an *amparo* in November 2015 suspending its exploitation license, and the MEM thereafter issued a resolution in March 2016 suspending Exmingua\u2019s exploitation rights.285\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 42.\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6\u00b6 44-45.\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 45.\n\nNotice of Arbitration, \u00b6\u00b6 51 (referring to \"the Progreso VII mine [being] already in production\"), \u00b6 52 (referring to the lifting of a gate blockade following which \"Exmingua's activities in Progreso VII resumed\"), \u00b6\u00b6 54-55 (referring to the November 2015 Supreme Court decision and the March 2016 MEM decision).\n\n223.\n\nThese passages support Claimants\u2019 clarification that certain references in their Notice of Arbitration to \"continuous\" blockades were not intended to refer primarily to the Progreso VII Project, or in any event to allege that blockades at that site (as opposed to the Supreme Court and MEM actions) were the proximate cause of the damages Claimants allege with respect to that Project. Claimants therefore insist that they are *not* pursuing any claim for pre-2016 events with respect to the Progreso VII Project. They also insist that with respect to later events, they do not allege any separate damages as a result of subsequent protests and blockades at the Progreso VII site, since Exmingua\u2019s license was suspended in any event. This explanation is credible in light of the Notice of Arbitration\u2019s references to the resumption of operations prior to the license suspension. The Tribunal takes Claimants at their word regarding what breach they in fact are alleging, and what breach they are not alleging, with respect to the Progreso VII Project.\n\n224.\n\nThe Notice of Arbitration is somewhat more problematic with respect to the adjacent Santa Margarita Project, since it simply states that \"Exmingua and its consultants... were unable to complete the public consultations required for its EIA due to the continuous and systematic protests and blockades at the site since 2012.\"286 The Notice of Arbitration does not indicate whether any access to the Santa Margarita site was restored during the interim period starting in May 2014 when Exmingua obtained access to the adjacent Progreso VII site; whether any efforts were made during this interim period to make progress on the EIA consultations for Santa Margarita; and whether any requests for assistance were made to Guatemala authorities during this period. These may be important factual questions for determining the timeliness of any full protection and security claim related to the Santa Margarita Project, but they are not questions the Tribunal can determine simply on the basis of the short initial pleading in this case.\n\nNotice of Arbitration \u00b6 48.\n\n225.\n\nFor purposes of the Preliminary Objection stage, the important point is that Claimants insist - despite any confusion that their Notice of Arbitration may have created - that they are *not pursuing* any full protection and security claim for events prior to the agreed \"critical date\" of 9 November 2015. On the basis of this statement, there is no longer (if there ever was) any *\"breach alleged* under Article 10.16.1\" with respect to the pre-critical date period.287 In the view of the Tribunal, this suffices to clear the initial hurdle for the Preliminary Objections stage, which is focused on the Claimants\u2019 allegations.\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.18.1 (CL-0001-ENG) (emphasis added).\n\n226.\n\nThis does not mean that the time-bar issue is resolved for purposes of this case - only that the jurisdictional issue it presents is one that properly requires factual investigation, and cannot be resolved simply as a matter of the very first pleading. In due course, the evidence likely will be developed regarding any relevant blockades, any relevant site access notwithstanding the blockades, and any relevant appeals for State assistance. The Tribunal may be called upon to decide whether the post-2016 events Claimants now emphasize for purposes of their treaty claim involved new State actions or omissions, or merely continuations of (or effects emanating from) prior State actions or omissions, questions which could well be relevant to the time-bar question. It is simply premature, with hardly any evidence in the record, for the Tribunal to reach conclusions of fact regarding \"the date on which the [Claimants] first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the breach\" they now allege, as well as the date of Claimants\u2019 actual or constructive \"knowledge that [they]... incurred loss or damage\" by reason of that breach.288\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.18.1 (CL-0001-ENG).\n\n227.\n\nThe Tribunal also considers it premature for it to opine now on the jurisprudence the Parties have presented regarding \"continuous acts\" and other relevant doctrinal issues in investment law. Discussion of legal principles is best done against the backdrop of a developed evidentiary record, and nothing in DR-CAFTA requires the Tribunal to decide at the preliminary objections stage a particular jurisdictional objection that is intensely fact-dependent, prior to the submission of evidence regarding the relevant facts. The Parties remain free to return to these legal issues in their subsequent memorials, in the context of the fuller evidentiary record the Tribunal trusts they will present.\n\n228.\n\nThe Tribunal accordingly denies the Respondent\u2019s application pursuant to DR-CAFTA Article 10.20.5 to dismiss at the outset Claimants\u2019 claim for lack of full protection and security because it is time-barred, and reserves for the merits phase of this arbitration the issues presented by that application.\n\n**VI. COSTS**\n-------------\n\n229.\n\nDR-CAFTA Article 10.20.6 authorizes a tribunal, \"if warranted,\" to award costs to the prevailing party at the preliminary objections stage, \"[w]hen it decides a respondent\u2019s objection under paragraph 4 or 5.\" The Treaty provides that \"[i]n determining whether such an award is warranted, the tribunal shall consider whether either the claimant\u2019s claim or the respondent\u2019s objection was frivolous....\"289\n\nDR-CAFTA, Article 10.20.6 (CL-0001-ENG).\n\n230.\n\nClaimants request an award of costs in their favor, on account of \"[t]he frivolous nature of Respondent\u2019s preliminary objections.\"290 Respondent requests an award of costs in its favor, because Claimants\u2019 claims \"fail as a matter of law\" and \"are frivolous.\"291\n\nClaimants' Submission on Costs of Preliminary Objection Phase, 14 February 2020, \u00b6 2.\n\nRepublic of Guatemala's Request for Costs, 14 February 2020, \u00b6 5.\n\n231.\n\nThe Tribunal declines to exercise the discretionary authority granted under Article 10.20.6 to make a costs award at the preliminary objections phase. It has denied Respondent\u2019s first two objections, but does not consider either of those to have been frivolous by any means. The first objection in particular presented a novel issue of law under DR-CAFTA which deserved attention and which required considerable analysis to resolve. The second objection was less novel, but nonetheless arose on account of Claimants\u2019 own decision to add an additional claim to their Notice of Arbitration, without flagging their intent to do so. Finally, the Tribunal has deferred the third objection for consideration together with the merits, given its fact-intensive nature. It is premature to determine at this stage which Party ultimately will prevail on the time-bar issue, and the Parties' and Tribunal's efforts in the meantime to this issue have not been wasted; the pleadings serve to educate all on the issues that ultimately will need to be resolved.\n\n232.\n\nAt this stage, therefore, the Tribunal simply takes due note of the Parties' positions and requests with respect to costs. It will deal with costs at the merits stage, which will allow it to make an overall assessment of the Parties' positions and conduct with respect to the preliminary objections in the context of the facts and the law developed during the remaining stages of this case.\n\n**VII. DISPOSITIF**\n-------------------\n\n233.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal:\n\n(1) Denies Respondent's application to dismiss this arbitration in its entirety on the basis of its first Preliminary Objection;\n\n(2) Denies Respondent's application to dismiss Claimants' Most-Favored-Nation claim on the basis of its second Preliminary Objection;\n\n(3) Denies Respondent's application to dismiss Claimant's Full Protection and Security claim on the basis of its third Preliminary Objection, only insofar as Respondent seeks resolution of its Article 10.18.1 jurisdictional objection as a preliminary matter, and defers that fact-intensive jurisdictional objection for further determination in conjunction with the merits of this case; and\n\n(4) Reserves decision on the Parties' respective requests for costs, for determination in conjunction with any subsequent such requests at the close of this proceeding."}]}
