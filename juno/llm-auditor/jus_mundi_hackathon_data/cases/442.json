INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.1.\n\nOn 15 January 2010, Claimants filed a Request for Arbitration (\"Request\") against Respondent (sometimes also referred to as \"Grenada\") alleging breach of the 1986 Treaty Between the United States and Grenada Concerning the Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment (\"Treaty\"). The Request was registered by the Secretary-General on 16 March 2010.\n\n1.2.\n\nOn 5 August 2010, the Tribunal was constituted, compromising Prof. Pierre Tercier (Switzerland), Edward W. Nottingham (USA) and J. William Rowley QC (Canada), with the latter as its President.\n\n1.3.\n\nOn the same date, Respondent filed: (a) a Request for Security for Costs (\"Security Application\") to protect its rights during the first phase of the proceeding; and (b) an Objection Under Arbitration Rules 41(5) (\"Objection\"). The Security Application seeks an order from the Tribunal that Claimants post USS 500,000 within 14 calendar days of the Tribunal\u2019s decision, failing which this proceeding should be suspended until such payment is made. This Decision deals only with Respondent\u2019s Security Application. In reaching our Decision, the Tribunal expresses no view as to the merits of either Respondent\u2019s Objection or the merits of underlying dispute.\n\n1.4.\n\nBy letter dated 13 August 2010, the Tribunal directed Claimants to provide their written response to the Security Application (\"Response\"), if advised, by 31 August 2010. The parties were also advised that the Tribunal envisaged being able to reach a decision on the Security Application on the basis of one round of written submissions and without the need for oral argument.\n\n1.5.\n\nOn 30 August 2010, Claimants filed their Response to Grenada\u2019s Security Application.\n\n**2. BACKGROUND TO PRESENT ARBITRATION**\n----------------------------------------\n\n2.1.\n\nClaimants\u2019 Request asserts claims under Treaty. The essence of those claims is that Grenada breached a number of its Treaty obligations to Claimants by reason of its dealings with Claimants in relation to a petroleum exploration agreement between one of the Claimants, RSM Production Corporation (\"RSM\"), and Grenada, dated 4 July 1996 (\"Agreement\").\n\n2.2.\n\nThe Agreement, in summary, provided for RSM to apply for, and Grenada to grant, a petroleum exploration licence within 90 days of the Agreement\u2019s effective date. In 2004, RSM applied for an exploration licence. Grenada denied the application as untimely and thereafter terminated the Agreement. This gave rise to a contractual dispute between the parties to the Agreement.\n\n2.3.\n\nThe Agreement\u2019s dispute resolution clause calls for disputes arising thereunder to be referred to Arbitration under the ICSID Convention, and on 31 August 2004, RSM submitted a request for arbitration. RSM\u2019s request was thereafter registered by ICSID and captioned as *RSM Production Corporation v Grenada,* ICSID Case NO ARBZ05/14 (\"Prior Arbitration\"). Following the exchange of pleadings and a five-day hearing (in London in June 2007) on the merits, a three-member ICSID tribunal (\"Prior Tribunal\") rendered an award (\"Prior Award\") on 13 March 2009.\n\n2.4.\n\nAmongst other things, the Prior Award dealt with RSM\u2019s contractual rights in relation to the Agreement, and declared:\n\n*\"The Tribunal declares that the Respondent [Grenada] did not breach any of its obligations to wards the Claimant [RSM] under their Agreement of 4 July 1996 in failing to issue an Exploration Licence to the Claimant, such obligation having lapsed on 28 March 2004 and the Agreement having been lawfully terminated on 5 July 2005 so that the Respondent had thereafter no further substantive contractual obligations to RSM\"1*\n\nExhibit R-1, Prior Award, at \u00a7503.\n\n2.5.\n\nRSM applied for annulment of the Prior Award pursuant to Article 52 of the ICSID Convention. The annulment application remains outstanding. Although it has been fully briefed, RSM has declined to pay the advance on costs requested by the Centre on 13 January 2010, and those proceedings are currently suspended. If RSM does not cure its default by 29 September 2010, the *ad hoc* Annulment Committee may discontinue the proceedings.\n\n**3. GRENADA\u2019S SECURITY APPLICATION**\n-------------------------------------\n\n3.1.\n\nGrenada contends that the present arbitration, which it says seeks to relitigate the factual and legal questions that have been resolved by the Prior Award, epitomises vexatious litigation.\n\n3.2.\n\nIt argues that RSM\u2019s refusal to pay the requested advance on costs in the annulment proceedings may have deprived it of any remedy for the costs im posed on it by those proceedings. Grenada also asserts that there is reason to believe that Claimants would not voluntarily comply with a costs award in its favour in this arbitration.\n\n3.3.\n\nGrenada says that the question for this Tribunal is not whether Claimants *can* satisfy a possible costs award; it is whether they *will* do so.\n\n3.4.\n\nClaimants are also said to have ample means to post the \"modest security\" Grenada requests. Requiring them to do so will prevent Claimants from using ICSID improperly as a tool to put pressure on Grenada. Respondent further argues that: (a) Claimants will have no incentive to comply with any award (as to costs) that the Tribunal may make, and every incentive to frustrate it; or, (b) they may tactically default before an award is rendered as, it is alleged, they did in the annulment proceedings.\n\n3.5.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s power to recommend security for costs pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of the Arbitration Rules is asserted to be unquestioned.\n\n**4. CLAIMANTS\u2019 RESPONSE**\n--------------------------\n\n4.1.\n\nClaimants contend that there is: (a) no legal authority that supports the Security Application and, (b) no factual basis for the requested amount.\n\n4.2.\n\nWith respect to their first point. Claimants say that the Secretary-General, in consultation with the President of the Tribunal, has determined that the costs for the first three to six months of the proceedings would be USS 250,000, which amount has been apportioned equally between the parties. They say that this precludes Respondent\u2019s Security Application because, although Article 61(2) of the Convention authorises the Tribunal, in an award, to apportion costs after the proceeding has been concluded, neither the Convention nor the Rules provide the Tribunal with the power to change the apportionment of costs prior to a final award or to provide for a party to post security for a potential costs award.\n\n4.3.\n\nAs to their second point, Claimants assert that the Security Application has only been made so as to allow Respondent to express its view in relation to earlier and unrelated litigation (litigation having no bearing on the present proceeding) in order to \"poison\" the views of the Tribunal regarding this arbitration.\n\n4.4.\n\nClaimants note that, at the time of their Response, they had promptly paid their share of the requested advance against costs, but Respondent had not.\n\n4.5.\n\nFinally, Claimants note the fact that, during the Prior Arbitration, Grenada\u2019s then Minister of Energy and Deputy Prime Minister confirmed that Global Petroleum Group Ltd (\"Global\") was paying Respondent\u2019s legal fees and expense. They state that if it turns out that Grenada is not paying its own expenses in this arbitration, then the request in its Security Application is dishonest, and security for costs is not required.\n\n**5. TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n5.1.\n\nGrenada\u2019s Security Application gives rise to three principal questions (set out below), some or all of which the Tribunal may be required to answer.\n\n(a) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction to recommend security for costs as a provisional measure?\n\n(b) If so, do the circumstances justify the making of such a recommendation?\n\n(c) In the event it is appropriate to recommend the lodging of security for costs, is the amount sought appropriate\n\n***Jurisdiction***\n------------------\n\n5.2.\n\nArticle 47 of the ICSID Convention provides, in pertinent part:\n\n*\"Except as the parties agree, the Tribunal may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, request any provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the respective rights of either party.\"*\n\n5.3.\n\nRule 39 of the Arbitration Rules provides, in pertinent part:\n\n\"(1) *At any time after the institution of the proceedings a party may request that provisional measures for the preservation of its rights he recommended by the Tribunal. The request shall specify the rights to be preserved, the measures the recommendation of which is requested, and the circumstances that require such measures.\"*\n\n5.4.\n\nGrenada identifies its right to request that Claimants be required to reimburse it for some or all of the costs it will incur in the proceedings as its right which is in need of immediate protection.\n\n5.5.\n\nNeither Article 47, nor Rule 39 specify the type of provisional measure a Tribunal may recommend. This being the case, and subject to one caveat, a measure requiring the lodging of security for costs (by no means an uncommon provisional measure) would not, as a matter of jurisdiction, appear to fall outside a tribunal's power. That is, unless such a measure cannot be said to relate to the preservation of the applying party\u2019s rights - the preservation of which is the only limiting factor on the nature of a permissible provisional measure.\n\n5.6.\n\nAs to what rights of a party may be preserved, it seems obvious that, in the context of a dispute, the parties\u2019 contested substantive rights have yet to be determined. For example, a party seeking damages for contractual or a treaty breach has no \"established\" or \"determined\" right to damages. Similarly, a party who seeks an ultimate award for costs has only a potential right to costs.\n\n5.7.\n\nWe are thus drawn to, and believe to be correct, the *Plama* Tribunal\u2019s conclusion that:\n\n*\"The rights to he preserved [under Article 47 and Rule 39] must relate to the requesting party\u2019s ability to have its claims considered and decided by the Arbitral Tribunal and for any arbitral decision which grants to the Claimant the relief it seeks to be effective and able to be carried out.\"* (Emphasis added)\n\n5.8.\n\nTo construe the rights that are to be protected or preserved under Article 47 and Rule 39 as being limited to \"established\" rights makes no sense whatever in the context of a *provisional* measure for their protection. Any such measure must, by definition, precede a determination of their substantive validity.\n\n5.9.\n\nThe learning to be drawn from previous published ICSID tribunal decisions also supports the conclusion that ICSID tribunals have the power (i.e. jurisdiction) in appropriate circumstances to recommend the lodging of security for costs.\n\n5.10.\n\nIn *Maffezini v Kingdom of Spain2,* Spain filed an application for *a* provisional measure, requesting the Tribunal to require the claimant to post a guarantee, bond or similar instrument in the amount of the costs expected to be incurred by Spain in the arbitration.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/97/7.\n\n5.11.\n\nAlthough the application was ultimately denied, the Tribunal did not appear to feel that the security for costs posed any particular jurisdictional problem compared with other provisional measures. However, it concluded that:\n\n*\"Any preliminary measure to be ordered by an ICSID arbitral tribunal must relate to the subject matter of the case before the tribunal and not to separate, unrelated issues or extraneous matters.*\n\n*In this case, the subject matter in dispute relates to an investment in Spain by an Argentinean investor while the request for provisional measures relates to a guarantee or bond to ensure payment of additional costs and expenses should the Claimant not prevail in the case.*\n\n*It is clear that these are two separate issues. The issue of provisional measure is unrelated to the facts of the dispute before the Tribunal.\"*3\n\n*Maffezini* Procedural Order Ho. 2, 28 October 1999, paras 23-25.\n\n5.12.\n\nObviously, a requested provisional measure must concern rights (in the sense as described in 5.6 - 5.8 above) which are at issues in the dispute. However, we do not believe that there is any requirement for a provisional measure to relate to the subject matter of the dispute in the same way that the *Maffezini* Tribunal seemed to see such a relationship, or lack thereof4.\n\nThe *Maffezini,* Tribunal\u2019s emphasis on a measure\u2019s necessary relationship to the subject matter of the ease is somewhat surprising, given that such a requirement is not specified in either the wording of Article 47 of the Convention or Rule 39. Indeed, it is possible that the Tribunal may have mistakenly been thinking of the provision for interim measures found in the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Article 26(1) of those rules provides that: \"At the request of either party, the arbitral tribunal may take any interim measures it deems necessary in respect of the subject-matter of the dispute, including measures for the conservation of the goods forming the subject-matter in dispute, such as ordering their deposit with a third person or the sale of perishable goods.\" (Emphasis added)\n\n5.13.\n\nIn the *Casado5* case, although the Tribunal denied the security application before it, it saw no jurisdictional limitation on its powers to make such a recommendation in the right circumstances. It reasoned that:\n\n*\"Taking account of the preceding general observations on provisional measures and of the absence of a clear answer in the text, there is no justification from excluding the tribunal from being able to recommend in certain circumstances, the deposition of a guarantee aimed at protecting the respondent against the eventual non-payment of costs...\"*6\n\n*Casado and President Allende Foundation v. Republic of Chile* ICSID Case No.ARB/98/2\n\n*Casado,* 16 ICSID Review - FILJ 567 (2001). p.3.\n\n5.14.\n\nThe Tribunal in *Atlantic Triton v. Guinea* reached the same conclusion with respect to a request for pre-judgment security by Guinea for its counterclaim in a contract-based ICSID arbitration. The Tribunal ultimately declined to recommend the furnishing of the requested financial guarantees, but it held that:\n\n*\"Recommendation of such measures would clearly be within its mandate under Article 47 of the ICSID Convention.\"7*\n\nP.D. Friedland, *\"\"Provisional measures and ICSID arbitration\",* Arbitration international, Vol. 2 No. 4 (1986), pp. 355-357\n\n5.15.\n\nFinally, in the most recent reported ICSID decision on security for costs, the *Libananco* Tribunal concluded that it had jurisdiction to order such interim measures, but that it would:\n\n*\"Only be in the most extreme cases... that the possibility of granting security for costs should be entertained at all.\"8*\n\n*Libananco Holdings Co Limited* v *Turkey,* ICSID Case No. ARB/06/8 Decision on Preliminary Issues, 23 June 2008.\n\n5.16.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal, by majority, considers that the wording of Article 47 and Rule 39(1), properly construed, is of sufficient reach to enable an ICSID tribunal, in an appropriate case, to grant provisional measures in the nature of security for costs.9\n\nArbitrator Nottingham feels that the Tribunal lacks the jurisdiction to order the posting of security for costs, for two reasons. First, there is no express provision allowing a Tribunal to order such a posting in the ICSID Convention or Arbitration Rules, in contrast to other bodies of law such as Section 38(3) of the English Arbitration Act of 1996 or Article 25.2 of the London Court of International Arbitration Rules. Second, the use of the words \"preserve\" and \"preserved\" in Article 47 and Rule 39 presupposes that the right to he preserved exists. Because Respondent has no existing right to an ultimate award of costs, the Tribunal is thus without jurisdiction\n\n***Do the Circumstances Justify such a Recommendation?***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n5.17.\n\nIt is beyond doubt that a recommendation of provisional measures is an extraordinary remedy which ought not to be granted lightly. Each of the *Maffezini, Casado* and *Libananco* Tribunals reached this conclusion. This is in line with widespread municipal precedent and jurisprudence. It is also beyond doubt that the burden to demonstrate why a tribunal should grant such an application is on the applicant.\n\n5.18.\n\nIn cases of security for costs. Arbitrators (and courts in jurisdictions which are prepared to make such an order) will rarely think it right to grant such an application if the party from whom security is sought appears to have sufficient assets to meet such an order, and if those assets would seem to be available for its satisfaction.\n\n5.19.\n\nIn an ICSID arbitration, it is also doubtful that a showing of an absence of assets alone would provide a sufficient basis for such an order. First, as was pointed out in *Libananco,* it is far from unusual in ICSID proceedings to be faced with a Claimant that is a corporate investment vehicle, with few assets, that was created or adapted specially for the purpose of the investment. Second, as was noted by the *Casado* Tribunal, it is simply not part of the ICSID dispute resolution system that an investor\u2019s claim should be heard only upon the establishment of a sufficient financial standing of the investor to meet a possible costs award.\n\n5.20.\n\nIt is difficult, in the abstract, to formulate a rule of general application against which to measure whether the making of an order for security for costs might be reasonable, but it seems clear to us that more should be required than a simple showing of the likely inability of a claimant to pay a possible costs award. However, on the record before us. it is unnecessary to offer a view as to the nature of what evidence might suffice.\n\n5.21.\n\nIn this case, Grenada has made no showing of Claimants\u2019 impecuniosity, nor of any unwillingness on their part to pay a costs award. There is also no evidence to suggest that the United States\u2019 courts would not fully enforce any costs award that might be made against Claimants by this Tribunal. The fact that there are four Claimants who would be jointly and several ly liable to pay any such award also min imizes the risk of non-payment.\n\n5.22.\n\nAll that Grenada has said about Claimants\u2019 financial standing is that \"Claimants have ample means to post the modest security Grenada requests\". This is the opposite to evidence of impecuniosity that is required.\n\n5.23.\n\nAs to Claimants\u2019 unwillingness to satisfy a possible award of costs, reliance is principally placed on: (a) RSM\u2019s decision not to post the advance on costs called for in its annulment application; and (b) Mr Jack Grynberg\u2019s attempt to place personal assets beyond the reach of his creditors some 10 years ago.10\n\nGrenada asserts that the conduct of RSM, its principals and Mr Grynberg strongly suggests \"that they [Claimants] will use any and every' available means to frustrate Grenada\u2019s attempts to enforce a costs award.\"\n\n5.24.\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree that the evidence relied on by Respondent is sufficient to support such a conclusion. First, RSM had every right not to continue with its annulment application. And while Mr Grynberg may be CEO of RSM, there is no evidence to suggest that either it or any of the three individual Claimants have sought to avoid previous cost awards or similar obligations. The behaviour of Mr Grynberg, more than a decade ago, in unrelated proceedings, simply cannot support the conclusion that Claimants will use every available means to avoid the enforcement of any potential costs award the Tribunal might in the future be minded to make against them in this proceeding.\n\n5.25.\n\nBecause Grenada has failed to meet its burden to show insufficient or unavailable assets, that is the end of the matter and it is not necessary to address the appropriateness of the amount sought for security by Respondent.\n\n**6.

Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments. \"5*\n\n*\"Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization except for a public purpose; in a non-discriminatory manner, upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of treatment provided for in Article II (2). \"6*\n\nRequest, at \u00b6 10.\n\nArt 11(2), Treaty, Exhibit C-7.\n\nArt III(l), Treaty, Exhibit C-7.\n\n2.4 **The Agreement**\n---------------------\n\n2.4.1.\n\n2.4.1 It is common ground that the Agreement provided for the arbitration of all disputes, differences or questions between the parties with respect to any matter out of or relating to the Agreement by a three person ICSID arbitration panel, pursuant to the ICSID Convention and its Arbitration Rules.\n\n2.4.2.\n\n2.4.2 Article 26.4 (b) of the Agreement provides:\n\n*\"The award resulting from arbitration shall be final and binding on the parties. \"*\n\n**3. CLAIMANTS\u2019 REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n3.1 **Nature of the Present Dispute**\n-------------------------------------\n\n3.1.1.\n\nClaimants say that the present dispute arises under the terms and conditions of the Agreement; that the Agreement clearly describes an \"investment\" within the jurisdiction of ICSID, and that Claimants, through RSM, have to date made an extensive investment in Grenada.\n\n3.2 **Alleged Breaches of the Treaty**\n--------------------------------------\n\n3.2.1.\n\nClaimants rely on five alleged breaches of the Treaty; summarised under descriptive sub-headings below.7\n\nThere is a slight uncertainty as to whether Claimants\u2019 allege breach of Article II (1) (most favoured nation provisions) of the Treaty. In paragraph 11 of their Request, Claimants list the protections provided under the Treaty, and include *inter alia,* the MFN protections of Article II (1). Claimants state that they discuss in later paragraphs \"Respondent\u2019s violations of these provisions\", in reverse order to the list. However, there is no apparent subsequent discussion of Respondent\u2019s breach of the most favoured nation provision. Nor, when they quote from what they consider to be the most pertinent provisions in the Treaty, do they quote from or set out the provisions of Article 11(1). Nevertheless, in the final analysis, we find that nothing turns on this uncertainty.\n\n***Expropriation***\n-------------------\n\n3.2.2.\n\nClaimants argue that, by violating the Agreement and precluding RSM\u2019s filing of its application for an exploration licence, Grenada expropriated their investment. Should it be determined that there was not an actual taking, Claimants say that Grenada\u2019s denial of RSM\u2019s application and the resultant termination of the agreement is a *de facto* expropriation. Further, Claimants also contend that Grenada\u2019s wrongful termination of the Agreement effectively, if not actually, expropriated RSM\u2019s investment without compensation, which clearly frustrates the letter and spirit of the Treaty.\n\n***Arbitrary, Discriminatory and Illegal Conduct***\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n3.2.3.\n\nClaimants submit that Grenada\u2019s termination of the Agreement can only be justified by its contrived counting procedure (in ascertaining the time limit for a licence application) which defies fact, logic and the law. Its failure to respond to RSM\u2019s letter of 27 February 2004 for two months, until the potential deadline had passed, is said to have been unreasonable, and demonstrates Grenada\u2019s intent to pursue other avenues for the exploration of its offshore hydrocarbon reserves, to the detriment of Claimants\u2019 investments. Such actions are claimed to have been arbitrary, discriminatory and illegal.\n\n***Breach of Agreement Contravenes International Law***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.2.4.\n\nClaimants says that Grenada\u2019s position, that RSM\u2019s application for an exploration license was untimely, is contrary to the terms of the Agreement, international law and Grenadian law, and constitutes a breach of the provisions and spirit of the Treaty.\n\n3.2.5.\n\nClaimants also contend that RSM\u2019s letter of 12 January 2004, which it describes as a \"courtesy and non-binding notification of the cessation of the *force majeure,* \" was not an effective notification of the conclusion of the *force majeure* (and did not restart counting for the 90-day period for the licence application) and that Grenada\u2019s assertion that RSM\u2019s license application was untimely is ineffective, because under relevant international and Grenadian law, time is of the essence only if it is explicitly so stated in the contract, which is clearly not the case as regards to the Agreement.\n\n***Full Protection and Security***\n----------------------------------\n\n3.2.6.\n\nClaimants assert that Respondent failed to provide their investment with full protection and security under the Treaty by failing to respond to RSM\u2019s letter of 27 February 2004 (a second notification of the conclusion of the *force majeure* period). Grenada is said to have arbitrarily rejected RSM\u2019s application, in breach of the Agreement, and that it further breached its obligation to provide full protection and security by failing to provide RSM any leeway with its calculation of the filing deadline \"which would have been in conformity with the *force majeure* provisions of the Agreement.\"\n\n3.2.7.\n\nClaimants argue that, contrary to the express language of the Treaty, Grenada nullified Claimants\u2019 investment at the earliest possible time afforded to it. In doing so, it frustrated the purpose of the Treaty.\n\n***Unfair and Inequitable Treatment***\n--------------------------------------\n\n3.2.8.\n\nFinally, Claimants say that Grenada\u2019s denial of RSM\u2019s application for an exploration license constituted a breach of the fair and equitable standard provided for in the Treaty. Claimants say that Grenada and its agents were placing personal gain over their obligations under the Treaty and by these actions violated the terms of the Treaty.\n\n**4. RESPONDENT\u2019S OBJECTION**\n-----------------------------\n\n4.1 **Introduction**\n--------------------\n\n4.1.1.\n\nGrenada requests an award dismissing all of Claimants\u2019 claims in this case under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), asserting that the legal and factual contentions on which the present claims depend have already been fully litigated in the Prior Arbitration.\n\n4.1.2.\n\nGrenada argues that all of Claimants\u2019 Treaty claims flow from allegations of breach of contract (Claimants specifically state that \"This investment dispute arises under the terms and conditions of the \"Petroleum Agreement.\"8) However, those contractual claims were fully litigated, resulting in a Prior Award that not only dismissed such claims, but also found that RSM - not Grenada - had breached the Agreement. Put differently, the essential predicate to the present Treaty claims has already been determined, conclusively and adversely to Claimants.\n\nRequest, at \u00b6 5, Exhibit R-2.\n\n4.1.3.\n\nGrenada notes that Article 53 of the ICSID Convention provides that ICSID awards are final, binding and not subject to appeal or review apart from the internal remedies provided by the Convention itself. However, the claims advanced here attempt to circumvent that basic principle and constitute an abuse of process.\n\n4.2 **The Applicable Standard**\n-------------------------------\n\n4.2.1.\n\nSince Rule 41(5) was adopted, two publicly available decisions have interpreted its \"manifestly without legal merit\" standard.9 According to those decisions, a Rule 41(5) objection must raise a \"legal impediment to a claim and not a factual one.\" Such legal impediment may go to either jurisdiction or the merits. In either case, a respondent must \"establish its objection clearly and obviously with relative ease and dispatch.\" Put another way, \"the exercise may [...] be complicated; but it never should be difficult.\" Assuming these are the applicable standards, Respondent says that they are satisfied.\n\n*Trans-Global Petroleum, Inc., v Jordan* ICSID (Case No. ARB/07/25), Decision of 12 May 2008 ***(\"Trans-Global\u2019j*** Exhibit RLA-30; and *Brandes Investment Partners LLP v Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/3), Decision of 2 February 2009 (\"***Brandes\"),*** Exhibit RLA-7.\n\n4.2.2.\n\nRespondent accepts that it is not the function of a Rule 41(5) objection to dispute a claimant\u2019s factual allegations and says it does not do so here. Grenada can and does, however, dispute the legal effect that Claimants attribute to certain events. For example, the Request alleges that on 12 January 2004, RSM sent Grenada a notice that *force majeure* no longer applied. Grenada accepts that the letter was sent, but it need not accept Claimants\u2019 contention that the letter was \"non-binding\" and \"was not [...] effective.\"10 Those are legal assertions - indeed, legal assertions that the Prior Tribunal rejected.\n\nRequest, at \u00b6\u00b6 6 and 18.\n\n4.2.3.\n\nFurthermore, Grenada says that, to the extent that the \"legal impediments\" to the current claims stem from factual findings by the Prior Tribunal, it is entitled to rely on such facts. The Prior Award is binding and it is accepted that a subsequent tribunal may consider the content of a prior judgment or award when ruling on a claim of *res judicata* or similar doctrines.\n\n4.3 **The Prior Arbitration**\n-----------------------------\n\n4.3.1.\n\nRespondent submits that the essential question in the Prior Arbitration was whether RSM\u2019s application for a petroleum license made on 13 April 2004 was timely and made in accordance with the Agreement.\n\n4.3.2.\n\nRespondent notes that the Agreement provided for RSM to apply for, and Grenada to grant an exploration license within 90 days of the Agreement\u2019s effective date. It says RSM invoked *force majeure* 14-days after the Agreement was signed and it did not apply for an exploration license until some eight years later.\n\n4.3.3.\n\nAs determined in the Prior Arbitration, RSM sent a notification to Grenada\u2019s Prime Minister, on 12 January 2004, nearly eight years after the effective date of the Agreement, \"to remove the *force majeure'\"* **(\"First Letter\").11** RSM sent a second letter on 27 February 2004, this time to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance **(\"Second Letter\").** Unlike the First Letter, the Second Letter included a purported computation of the 90-day period within which the exploration license was to be applied for and granted. RSM\u2019s calculation assumed, amongst other things, that the *force majeure* period ended with the sending of the 27 February letter - not the 12 January letter -and thus, that the 90-day period recommenced on 27 February 2004 and would end on 10 May 2004.\n\nGrynberg-Mitchell letter (12 January 2004), Exhibit R-6.\n\n4.3.4.\n\nGrenada, which had responded to the 12 January letter to the Prime Minister, did not respond to the 27 February letter to the Permanent Secretary.\n\n4.3.5.\n\nGrenada says that its silence (until late April) is explained by the fact, not mentioned in the Request, but found as a fact by the Prior Tribunal after considering all the evidence, that the Second Letter was not actually delivered to the Ministry of Finance until 14 April 2004.12\n\nPrior Award, at \u00b6\u00b6 181 -86, Exhibit R-1.\n\n4.3.6.\n\nRSM prepared an application for an exploration license, dated 6 April 2004. On 27 April 2004, Grenada denied RSM\u2019s license application on the grounds that it was untimely. After further correspondence, Grenada terminated the Agreement on 5 July 2005.\n\n4.4 **The Prior Award**\n-----------------------\n\n4.4.1.\n\nAlthough the Prior Award dealt with many issues, including a jurisdictional objection and counterclaims by Grenada, Grenada says that one paragraph from the *dispositif,* entirely precludes all the claims made by Claimants in the current arbitration:\n\n*\"The Tribunal declares that the Respondent* [Grenada] *did not breach any of its obligations toward the Claimant* [RSM] *under their Agreement of 4 July 1996 in failing to issue an Expiration License to the Claimant, such obligation having lapsed on 28 March 2004 and the Agreement having been lawfully terminated on 5 July 2005 so that the Respondent had thereafter no further substantive contractual obligations to RSM. \"13*\n\nPrior Award, at \u00b6 503.\n\n4.4.2.\n\nRespondent notes that in reaching this conclusion, the Prior Tribunal made the following findings on issues that the parties had contested with evidence, legal authority and argument:\n\n(a) RSM\u2019s 12 January 2004 letter to the Prime Minister had terminated the period of *force majeure* and re-commenced the running of the 90-day period within which RSM had to apply for the exploration license.14\n\n(b) The 14-days that had elapsed between the signing of the Agreement and RSM\u2019s invocation of *force majeure* counted towards the 90-day limit.15\n\n(c) Therefore, the 90-day period had ended on 28 March 2004.16\n\n(d) RSM had applied for a license on either 13 or 14 April 2004 (being the date of its receipt by Grenada), some two weeks after the 90-day period had expired.17\n\n(e) The relevant clause of the Agreement, properly construed under Grenadian law, made RSM\u2019s compliance with the 90-day limit a \"condition\" of the contract, which is the term of art in English law for an obligation whose breach permits the other party to terminate the contract.18\n\n(f) RSM\u2019s compliance with the 90-day limit was also a condition precedent to all of Grenada\u2019s subsequent obligations under the Agreement. This was an alternative basis for concluding that Grenada had no further obligation to RSM once RSM failed to make a timely application.19\n\nPrior Award, at \u00b6\u00b6 173, 343-45.\n\nPrior Award, at \u00b6\u00b6 343-45.\n\nPrior Award, at \u00b6 345.\n\nPrior Award, \u00b6\u00b6 203, 345.\n\nPrior Award, \u00b6 377.\n\nPrior Award, \u00b6 377.\n\n4.5 **Allegations of Treaty Breach**\n------------------------------------\n\n4.5.1.\n\nGrenada says that Claimants assert that Grenada violated the Treaty in five respects:\n\n(a) expropriating Claimants investments without compensation;\n\n(b) acting in an \"arbitrary, discriminatory and illegal fashion\";\n\n(c) breaching the Agreement in ways contrary to international law;\n\n(d) failing to provide full protection and security; and\n\n(e) failing to treat Claimants fairly and equitably.\n\n4.5.2.\n\nRespondent says that each of these claims depends on RSM\u2019s assertion that, by failing to grant RSM\u2019s application for an exploration license, Grenada breached the Agreement - contrary to the *dispositif* of the Prior Award. It argues that these claims also depend on the proposition that the Prior Tribunal was incorrect about each of the factual and legal findings set out in paragraph 4.4.2 above.\n\n4.5.3.\n\nGrenada points out that Claimants\u2019 unlawful expropriation claim is headed \"Grenada\u2019s Violation of the Agreement Constitutes an Expropriation in Explicit Violation of the Terms of the Treaty.\"20\n\nRequest, at \u00b6 25.\n\n4.5.4.\n\nClaimants\u2019 claim concerning arbitrary, discriminatory and illegal action attacks Grenada\u2019s \"contrived counting procedure\" with respect to the 90-day period and criticises Grenada for not responding until April to the letter dated 27 February 2004 (which the Prior Tribunal found had not been delivered until 14 April 2004).\n\n4.5.5.\n\nAs regards Claimants\u2019 assertions of violation of international law, Respondent points out that the heading of this claim reveals its dependence on contractual breach - \"Grenada\u2019s Breach of the Agreement is Contrary to International Law.\"21 The text also sets out a series of contentions that the Prior Award expressly rejected.\n\nRequest, at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n\n4.5.6.\n\nClaimants\u2019 case based on full protection and security is likewise said to depend on alleged breaches of the Agreement, and the contractual essence of Claimants\u2019 case for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard is said to be captured in the opening sentence of that claim which asserts that \"Respondent failed to treat Claimants fairly and equitably when it denied the application.\"\n\n4.6 **Claims Are Manifestly Without Legal Merit**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n4.6.1.\n\nGrenada advances four arguments in support of its contention that Claimants\u2019 claims are manifestly without legal merit.\n\n4.6.2.\n\nFirst, it says that the essential predicate of every claim in the Request is that the Agreement required Grenada to grant RSM\u2019s April 2004 license application. It follows that, if Claimants cannot prove that Grenada breached the Agreement by denying the application, then all of their claims must fail. As to this, it asserts that the municipal-law issues have already been referred to and decided by the agreed forum. The Prior Tribunal had jurisdiction to construe the Agreement definitively, and it did so, finding against RSM on all relevant factual and legal contentions.\n\n4.6.3.\n\nRespondent thus says that the Tribunal may not take on the task of deciding whether Grenada breached the Agreement. Indeed, reopening the findings of the Prior Tribunal would violate Article 53 of the ICSID Convention: \"the award shall be binding on the parties and not shall be subject to any appeal to any other remedy except those provided for in this convention.\"\n\n4.6.4.\n\nSecondly, Respondent asserts that Claimants\u2019 claims must additionally be dismissed under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. Under that doctrine a question may not be re-litigated if, in a prior proceeding: (a) it was put in issue; (b) the court or tribunal actually decided it; and (c) the resolution of the question was necessary to resolving the claims before that court or tribunal.\n\n4.6.5.\n\nCollateral estoppel, it is said, is well established as a general principle of law applicable in international courts and tribunals being a species of *res judicata.*\n\n4.6.6.\n\nAs framed by the *Amco II* Tribunal, chaired by Professor Higgins (as she then was), the general principle is that:\n\n*\"[A] right, question or fact distinctly put in issue and distinctly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction as a ground of recovery, cannot be disputed. \"22*\n\n*Amco Asia Corporation v Republic of Indonesia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1), Resubmitted Case, Decision on Jurisdiction, 10 May 1988, at \u00b6\u00a030.\n\n4.6.7.\n\nGrenada says that the Prior Tribunal\u2019s findings are entitled to such preclusive effect and its conclusions bind both RSM, as a party to the Prior Arbitration, and RSM\u2019s three shareholders, who are privies of RSM, and whose claims in this proceeding are entirely derivative of and dependent on RSM\u2019s alleged rights under the Agreement. Grenada notes that the latter point is clearly made in the Request, where it is stated that, \"Claimants, through RSM, have to date made an extensive investment in Grenada.\"23\n\nRequest, at \u00b6 5, Exhibit R-2.\n\n4.6.8.\n\nGrenada accepts that RSM is a juridical entity with legal personality separate from its three shareholders. However, it says that this does not alter the analysis for two reasons. First, the shareholders\u2019 putative investment is a contract to which RSM is a party and the shareholders are not; the shareholders seek compensation for damages that they allegedly have suffered indirectly through RSM for violations of RMS\u2019s legal rights. Second, the three individual Claimants collectively own 100% of RSM\u2019s stock, and there is nothing unfair in holding them to the result of RSM\u2019s litigation. Indeed, if the individual Claimants wish to claim standing on the basis of their indirect interests in corporate assets, they must be subject to defences that are available against the corporation - including collateral estoppel.\n\n4.6.9.\n\nGrenada thirdly, argues that the Treaty\u2019s fork-in-the-road clause precludes the current proceeding.\n\n4.6.10.\n\nArticle VI(3) of the Treaty gives the investor the option of submitting the dispute to ICSID, rather than in accordance with a previously agreed and applicable procedure. The investor has thus been given a choice, but it must make that choice once and live with it:\n\n*\"Either party to the dispute may institute proceedings before the Centre provided: (i) the dispute has not been submitted by the national or company for resolution in accordance with any applicable previously agreed dispute settlement procedures... \"24*\n\nTreaty, Art. VI(3)(a) - (1), Exhibit R-2.\n\n4.6.11.\n\nHere, says Grenada, Claimants concede that the claims raised in the two proceedings - for breach of contract (the Agreement) in the Prior Arbitration and the breach of Treaty in the present proceeding - are part of the same dispute: \"This Request involves a legal dispute, as the issue is whether Grenada\u2019s action constitute a breach of the Treaty and Agreement.\"25\n\nRequest, at 27.\n\n4.6.12.\n\nSimilarly, after recounting the events of April 2004, the Request notes that: \"Subsequent attempts by RSM itself to amicably resolve the matter were unsuccessful.\"26\n\nRequest, at \u00b6 9.\n\n4.6.13.\n\nHowever, RSM never tried to resolve the distinct BIT dispute amicably. The first time RSM every mentioned the instant claims to Grenada was in the Request.\n\n4.6.14.\n\nArticle VI(3)(i) of the Treaty is intended to prevent the re-litigation of disputes. As cases such as *Vivendi* (first annulment committee) and *ATA Construction* confirm, that objective is thwarted if claimants can bring successive cases that, despite raising formally distinct legal causes of action, are *co-extensive.* share the same *fundamental basis,* or derive *from the same origin or source.* That is said to be precisely the situation here - Claimants\u2019 Treaty claims being based entirely on the same events that underlay the breach of contract claims submitted to the Prior Tribunal.\n\n4.6.15.\n\nFinally, Grenada says that the claims here advanced by Claimants are an attempt to circumvent the basic principles enshrined in Article 53 of the ICSID Convention - *i.e.,* that ICSID awards are final, binding and not subject to appeal or review apart from the internal remedies provided by the Convention itself. As such Claimants\u2019 claims constitute a clear abuse of process.\n\n4.6.16.\n\nAnd, although there is no express provision in the ICSID Convention giving the Tribunal the power to dismiss this proceeding for abuse of process, Grenada says that the Tribunal has the inherent power to do so to protect the integrity of its own process. Here, Respondent relies on the fact that RSM previously argued, successfully, in favour of such inherent powers:\n\n*\"The Committee agrees with the Applicant that international courts and tribunals have certain inherent* *powers which permit them to exercise powers which may go beyond the express terms of their constitutive instruments. \"27*\n\n*RSM Production Corporation v Grenada* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/14), Annulment Proceeding, Decision on RSM Production Corporation\u2019s Application for a Preliminary Ruling of 29 October 2009 (7 December 2009), at\u00a0\u00b6 20, Exhibit R-10.\n\n4.6.17.\n\nRespondent points out that notable commentators from common-law jurisdictions have accepted that successive proceedings should be dismissed under the doctrines of abuse of process or abuse of rights, even where the requirements of *res judicata* may not have been met; this is particularly true if the successive proceedings are vexatious.\n\n4.6.18.\n\nGrenada thus contends that the purpose and spirit of Article 53 of the ICSID Convention, which precludes any appeal or remedy, other than those explicitly set forth in the Convention, is thwarted when claimants empanel successive ICSID tribunals to hear their case, hoping that one panel will eventually side with them. The ICSID system likewise does not permit subsequent tribunals to sit in judgment of other ICSID tribunals. To allow Claimants to proceed with this arbitration would force this Tribunal to act in such ways, forcing it also to be complicit in Claimants\u2019 abuse.\n\n**5. CLAIMANTS\u2019 OPPOSITION TO THE OBJECTION**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n**5.1 Overview of Opposition**\n------------------------------\n\n5.1.1.\n\nClaimants say that Grenada\u2019s Objection cannot succeed because it fails to show that any of the claims are manifestly without legal merit.\n\n5.1.2.\n\nThey note that Grenada relies exclusively, as the basis for its Objection, on findings in the Prior Award that Grenada was not in breach of the Agreement. However, Claimants contend that there is nothing inconsistent with finding that Grenada complied with the terms of its Agreement with RSM, yet violated the Treaty, it being well settled that BITs provide an independent source of rights to investors which can, depending on the BIT provisions or the precise facts, expand an investor\u2019s rights over and above what is contained in any contract. Thus, a finding that there has been no breach of the Agreement does not stop an ICSID tribunal from determining whether or not there has been a violation of an applicable BIT.\n\n5.1.3.\n\nIn the present case, the Prior Arbitration did not involve any allegations of Treaty violations. Moreover, the three individual Claimants in this case were not part of the Prior Arbitration. More importantly, the Prior Tribunal was not asked to, nor did it, examine issues pertaining to corruption. However, it is now clear that Grenada\u2019s reasons for denying RSM a licence were based on the corrupt motives of individual officials entrusted with Grenada\u2019s natural resources, specifically Senator Gregory Bowen, the former Minister of Energy and Deputy Prime Minister.28\n\nClaimants say that \"RSM did not raise issues of corruption in the Prior ICSID Proceeding because almost all of the evidence of Grenada\u2019s corruption was uncovered by RSM after commencement of the Prior ICSID Proceeding, with most of the discoveries coming at or after the June 2007 hearing in the Prior ICSID Proceeding.\" Opposition,\u00b6 8.\n\n5.1.4.\n\nClaimants assert that the evidence of corruption they will lead will show that RSM was forced out because Global Petroleum Group Ltd **(\"Global Petroleum\"),** bribed Senator Bowen. They say that Grenada\u2019s corrupt motives for replacing RSM (a non-bribe-giver) with Global Petroleum (a bribe-giver) constitutes a clear violation of the Treaty provisions.\n\n5.1.5.\n\nFinally, unlike the contract case before the Prior Tribunal, which was decided under Grenadian law, these proceedings involve, and this Tribunal will be required to resolve, different issues and interpret different law.\n\n5.2 **Alleged Evidence of Corruption**\n--------------------------------------\n\n5.2.1.\n\nClaimants allege that Global Petroleum was founded in December 2003 (by Lev Model, a convicted villain of Russian origin, Lev Korshagin, a Russian attorney, and Eduaro Vasilev) and that, within months of its formation, Grenada was taking active steps to get out of its Agreement with RSM.\n\n5.2.2.\n\nThey say that RSM learned of Global Petroleum\u2019s existence for the first time in August 2005 when Lev Korshagin contacted RSM\u2019s Chief Executive, Jack Grynberg, in an effort to settle the Prior Arbitration. Mr Korshagin, who advised that he was a director of Global Petroleum, a Grenadian oil and gas company, suggested that he and Mr Grynberg meet in London to resolve any problems RSM had in Grenada. He further explained that \"if his group could participate as a partner in RSM\u2019s offshore Grenada licence, his group would work everything out.\" He assured Mr Grynberg of a positive outcome because he claimed that \"his group \u2018owns\u2019 the Government of Grenada.\"\n\n5.2.3.\n\nThereafter, Mr Grynberg received a call from Michael Melnicke, an ambassador-at-large in the United States, hired by Grenada. Mr Melnicke offered to be a peace maker with Grenada, and sought compensation for his efforts by way of a proposed substantial overriding royalty based on the amount of oil and natural gas that would ultimately be produced pursuant to the exclusive RSM/Grenada Agreement.\n\n5.2.4.\n\nIn the course of their many conversations, Mr Melnicke revealed to Mr Grynberg in early 2006 that two business tycoons with roots in Russia, Len Blavatnik and Mikhail Fridman, had bribed Senator Bowen so that their group could develop the petroleum reserves believed to exist in the offshore Grenadian territory. Messers Blavatnik and Fridman promised to pay additional bribes to Grenadian Government officials in the future as well as to pay all Grenada\u2019s legal fees in connection with the Prior Arbitration.\n\n5.2.5.\n\nMr Grynberg calculated that the overriding royalty that Mr Melnicke was seeking was worth at least US$ 10,000,000 and that most, if not all of that money, would end up in the pockets of individual Grenadian Government officials.\n\n5.2.6.\n\nIn December 2007, William J. Leyton, a California resident who was incarcerated at the time, provided a declaration to RSM that confirmed Mr Melnicke\u2019s admission that he was hoping to pay-off Grenadian government officials, including the then Prime Minister Mitchell, with the overriding royalty he had hoped to receive from RSM.\n\n5.2.7.\n\nDuring the hearing in the Prior Arbitration, Senator Bowen testified that Global Petroleum had financed the Arbitration and that it had entered into an agreement with Grenada pertaining to this funding arrangement. He further testified that he had negotiated the funding agreement with Messers Vasilev and Korshagin in September 2005.\n\n5.2.8.\n\nThe minutes of certain official Grenadian Government proceedings which have been made public show that Global petroleum had, by July 2007, invested over US$ 4,000,000 into the legal defence of the Government of Grenada in the Prior Arbitration. Claimants have also discovered evidence that Mr Lev Model paid a cheque for US$ 2,500,000 to the Government of Grenada dated 12 October 2005.\n\n5.2.9.\n\nIn October 2007, RSM learned that Mr Model, as an illegal bribe payment to Senator Bowen, paid the college tuition of Senator Bowen\u2019s daughter. In June 2008, the Mitchell Government issued Grenada\u2019s offshore exploration licence to Global Petroleum just before the July 2008 elections. The licence has since been suspended by the present Government.\n\n5.3 **Claimants\u2019 Treaty Claims**\n--------------------------------\n\n*Correct Approach for the Tribunal*\n-----------------------------------\n\n5.3.1.\n\nRelying on the *Brandes* Tribunal\u2019s analysis of the constitutive elements of an Article 41(5) objection, Claimants argue that the Tribunal must assume that the facts they allege are true. Accordingly, the Tribunal must determine whether, if the alleged facts are proven, they would constitute a violation of the Treaty. If so, then this case must proceed to the merits.\n\n*Inequitable and Discriminatory Treatment*\n------------------------------------------\n\n5.3.2.\n\nClaimants contend that the corrupt relationship between Global Petroleum and Grenada\u2019s former high level officials, if proven, supports their position that the corruption lead to the breaches of the Treaty. This is because Grenada cannot, in a manner consistent with the Treaty, use a hyper-technical procedure (Grenada\u2019s so-called contrived counting exercise) as a pretext for terminating its relationship with RSM (even if *arguendo* the terms of the Agreement permitted it to do so) when the real reason for terminating was the desire of high-level former Grenadian officials to do bribe-induced business with a company founded by a convicted felon. This is precisely the type of inequitable, discriminatory conduct that is forbidden by the Treaty.\n\n5.3.3.\n\nClaimants say that Grenada\u2019s entire argument rests on the false premise that the Prior Arbitration conclusively resolved all issues in this Arbitration. Claimants contend that this must be wrong where the causes of action are different in the two proceedings. Moreover, breach of contract issues do not dispose of BIT issues because a party may be in compliance with an international contract but still run afoul of a BIT.\n\n5.3.4.\n\nHere, the current arbitration is necessary because Grenada chose to conceal the corrupt relationship between Global Petroleum and its former Government officials.\n\n*Collateral Estoppel*\n---------------------\n\n5.3.5.\n\nClaimants accept that Grenada\u2019s description of the requirements for collateral estoppel are correct but says that it has misapplied them. They assert that collateral estoppel cannot apply in this instance because the question \u2018put in issue\u2019 in the Prior Arbitration arose out of the Agreement, but no Treaty question was dealt with. Moreover, the question of corruption which is at the heart of this arbitration was not considered in the Prior Arbitration.\n\n5.3.6.\n\nClaimants also say that Grenada\u2019s collateral estoppel argument obscures the independent interests that the three individual Claimants possess under the Treaty. The fact that their investment was made through RSM does not alter the individual Claimants\u2019 standing under the Treaty.\n\n*Fork-in-the-Road*\n------------------\n\n5.3.7.\n\nAs a threshold matter, Claimants say that even if Grenada\u2019s fork-in-the-road analysis was correct, it would not bar the individual Claimants\u2019 claims, who were not parties to the Prior Arbitration. Grenada\u2019s argument that the same investor \"cannot change its mind\" does not apply to individual investors who did not make any choice in the first instance.\n\n5.3.8.\n\nClaimants rely on the views expressed by the first *ad hoc* Annulment Committee in *Compania de Aguas del Aconquija SA et al. v. Argentina* for the proposition that a tribunal may not ignore alleged treaty violations because another tribunal has determined contractual issues.\n\n5.4 **Claimants\u2019 Supplementary Oral Submissions**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n5.4.1.\n\nDuring the course of Claimants\u2019 oral submission on 25 October 2010 in Washington, Ms Orr said that Claimants were not claiming that they could relitigate the decision that was before the Prior Tribunal: \"We are not trying to litigate - - re-litigate a breach of contract action.\"29\n\nTranscript, 157/7-15, 158/13-15\n\n5.4.2.\n\nNevertheless, she also took the position that \"this panel is [not] bound by the prior panel,\" and that \"the facts, as developed in this case, could lead to a different conclusion.\" Specifically, it was her position that the facts as developed in this case could and would lead to a different conclusion as to whether the allegations of fact as set forth by Grenada were reasonable or correct. By way of example, it would open to the Tribunal to assess and determine whether the Second Letter \"was not received by them for two weeks, if that makes any sense.\"30\n\nTranscript, 148/15-159/8.\n\n5.4.3.\n\nThe rationale for this approach is that, armed with the facts of corruption now alleged, the Tribunal would be entitled to reach different conclusions from those reached by the Prior Tribunal on the facts - such as whether Grenada received the Second Letter only after the 90-day period had expired.\n\n5.4.4.\n\nMs Orr as well confirmed that Claimants were indeed asserting five Treaty violations.31\n\nTranscript 174/18-175/5.\n\n5.4.5.\n\nWhen also asked by the Tribunal to identify what acts or measures of Grenada (in addition to those set out in their Request) that Claimants considered to constitute breaches of the Treaty standards, Ms Orr responded as follows:\n\n*MS ORR: \"Well, those will be developed more fully in our subsequent submissions. The - - what occurred is that Global Petroleum came in and paid money to some of the prior Government officials and obtained their agreement get the licenses that we held at that time, or we would have held.*\n\n*PRESIDENT ROWLEY: You would have held if you took certain steps under the contract to apply for them?*\n\n*MS ORR: Correct.*\n\n*And it was in the contract the Agreement was pretty much that the license applications were fairly much of a pro forma thing, that Grenada was to grant the licenses and that - - but that you had to apply for that, and that\u2019s when they claimed we were untimely in filing them.*\n\n*But during the time Global Petroleum came in, and they made the determination that they you were going to have Global Petroleum do the drilling, which has apparently turned out not to be the case, but at that time it is our understanding that Global Petroleum said they would take care of the finances, financial arrangements for Grenada to fight RSM and to pay Freshfields and to pay the Tribunal and that sort of thing, and that they would then get the licenses. And there were a number -- there was a number of things that were involved in all of that, which I won\u2019t go into at length at this time, but that\u2019s basically what the overview of what occurred, so that they - - instead of honoring the Treaty and our involvement, RSM\u2019s involvement at that time, they decided to take a different route.*\n\n*ARBITRATOR NOTTINGHAM: So, in some sense, you \u2019re saying the prior proceeding was a charade on* *the part of the previous Grenada government? That is to say, your allegation is that they made the arrangement with Global Petroleum; and, after having made that arrangement, they litigated in the Prior ICSID Tribunal and got a favorable decision?*\n\n*MS ORR: Yes, sir. \"*\n\n**6. TRIBUNAL\u2019S APPROACH**\n--------------------------\n\n6.1 **Requirements of Article 41(5)**\n-------------------------------------\n\n6.1.1.\n\nBased on the conclusions of the *Trans-Global* and *Brandes* Tribunals, the parties appear to find common ground as to the requirements of Article 41(5)\u2019s \"manifestly without legal merit\" standard. That is, that an objection under Article 41(5):\n\n(a) may go either to jurisdiction or the merits;\n\n(b) must raise a legal impediment to a claim, not a factual one; and\n\n(c) must be established clearly and obviously, with relative ease and dispatch.\n\n6.1.2.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with these requirements, and also with the *Trans-Global* Tribunal\u2019s conclusions that:\n\n*\"the standard is thus set high \"32*\n\n*\"as regards disputed facts relevant to the legal merits of a claimant\u2019s claim, the tribunal need not accept at face value any factual allegation which the tribunal regards as (manifestly) incredible, frivolous or vexatious or inaccurate or in bad faith: nor need a tribunal accept a legal submission dressed up as a factual allegation. The Tribunal does not* *accept, however, that a tribunal should otherwise weigh the credibility or plausibility of a disputed factual allegation. \"33*\n\nExhibits RLA-30,\u00b688.\n\nExhibit RLA-30, \u00b6 105. It will be observed that the first component of the quoted conclusion points to a slight difference between the Tribunal\u2019s and Claimants\u2019 view as to how the Tribunal may approach the facts, (Claimants asserting that \"the Tribunal must assume the alleged facts to be true\"). In this case, however, nothing turns on this slight difference as there is no present dispute for present purposes as to the facts alleged either by Claimants or Respondent. It is true that Grenada does dispute the legal effect that Claimants attribute to certain events. But such assertions are legal assertions, and they are a proper subject for assessment on an Article 41(5) application.\n\n6.1.3.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s agreement with the conclusions of the *Trans-Global* and *Brandes* Tribunals\u2019 as to the requirements of Article 41(5), means it is not necessary to rehash or to seek to supplement their analyses. However, given the potentially decisive nature of an Article 41(5) objection, we would add that, for a tribunal faced with such an objection, it is appropriate that a claimants\u2019 Request for Arbitration be construed liberally and that, in cases of doubt or uncertainty as to the scope of a claimant\u2019s allegation(s), any such doubt or uncertainty should be resolved in favour of the claimant. The Tribunal has proceeded on this basis.\n\n6.1.4.\n\nUnlike the Convention\u2019s provisions relating to the registration of a Request for Arbitration (Convention Article 36(3)), Article 41(5) of the ICSID Rules does not limit a tribunal\u2019s analysis of the manifest absence of legal merit to a claimant\u2019s Request for Arbitration. For this reason, the Tribunal considers it right also to have regard to Claimants\u2019 submissions contained in their Opposition (explaining their claims) as well as those made by Ms Orr at the first meeting on 25 October 2010 in analysing the Article 41(5) standard.\n\n6.1.5.\n\nIt should be noted that the Tribunal\u2019s summaries, contained in this Award, of Claimants\u2019 claims, submissions and explanations do not pretend to be exhaustive. Nonetheless, the Tribunal has considered Claimants\u2019 complete case in coming to the decision reflected in this Award.\n\n6.1.6.\n\nAs regards the scope of Claimants\u2019 case, even though the Request appears to assert five claims, limited to breach of Treaty Articles III (1) (Expropriation) and II (2) (arbitrary and discriminatory measures; treatment in accordance with international law; full protection and security; and, fair and equitable treatment), the Tribunal will also consider a possible claim for breach of Article II (1) (concerning most favoured nation protection).\n\n6.2 **Questions Arising**\n-------------------------\n\n6.2.1.\n\nBased on these requirements, the Tribunal, in Section 7 below, addresses three fundamental questions:\n\n(a) Are the findings of the Prior Tribunal in relation to breach of the Agreement and its termination binding on the Tribunal (the collateral estoppel and ICSID Convention Article 53 questions)?\n\n(b) If so, can any of Claimants\u2019 five (possibly six) claims of Treaty breach survive in the face of these findings?\n\n(c) If so, is this arbitration precluded by the Treaty\u2019s fork-in-the-road clause or by reason of Claimants\u2019 alleged abuse of process?\n\n**7. TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n7.1 **Binding Effect of the Prior Award**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*Collateral Estoppel*\n---------------------\n\n7.1.1.\n\nThe disputing parties do not differ as to the requirements for the application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel. They agree that a finding concerning a right, question or fact may not be re-litigated (and, thus, is binding on a subsequent tribunal), if, in a prior proceeding: (a) it was distinctly put in issue; (b) the court or tribunal actually decided it; and (c) the resolution of the question was necessary to resolving the claims before that court or tribunal.\n\n7.1.2.\n\nIt is also not disputed that the doctrine of collateral estoppel is now well established as a general principle of law applicable in the international courts and tribunals such as this one.34\n\n*Amoco Asia Corporation v Republic of Indonesia,* ICSID Case No. ARB/81/1, Decision on Jurisdiction (Re-submitted Case) (10 May 1988) at 30, Exhibit RLA-1. The analysis in the well known passage of Professor Higgins (as she then was) which is relied upon by Grenada (quoted at 4.6.6 above) is similar to those used by the mixed claims commission in the *Company General of the Orinoco Case,* Exhibit RLA-13, which itself quoted the ETS Supreme Court\u2019s Decision in *Southern Pacific Railroad Co. v U.S.,* Exhibit RLA-38. The latter case is of special significance here because of its holdings that the collateral estoppel rule applies in a subsequent suit \"[...] between the same parties or their privies.\"\n\n7.1.3.\n\nBut, Claimants\u2019 argument, that the questions \"put in issue\" in the Prior Arbitration concerned the Agreement, and that the Prior Tribunal considered no Treaty questions, is not an answer to Grenada\u2019s argument. Claimants\u2019 argument confuses issue preclusion and claim preclusion. As the United States Supreme Court says in *Southern Pacific Railroad Co v United States,* 168U.S.1, 48-49 (1897), \"The general principle announced in numerous cases is that a right, question, or fact distinctly put in issue, and directly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction as a ground of recovery cannot be disputed in a subsequent suit between the same parties or their privies, and, even if the second suit is for a different cause of action, the right, question, or fact once so determined must, as between the same parties or their privies, be taken as conclusively established so long as the judgment in the first suit remains unmodified.\" Here, Respondent does not seek to argue that the Prior Tribunal determined the Treaty questions that Claimants now raise, but rather that its findings on a series of rights, questions and fact, bind this Tribunal and that *these findings* must apply in the assessment of whether Claimants present Treaty claims are \"manifestly without legal merit.\"\n\n*Individual Claimants Are Bound*\n--------------------------------\n\n7.1.4.\n\nClaimants only other argument against the application of the principle is that the three individual Claimants\u2019 claims cannot be affected (as regards the rights, questions and facts that were determined by the Prior Tribunal) since only RSM and Grenada were parties to the Prior Arbitration.\n\n7.1.5.\n\nIn the circumstances of this case, however, the fact the three individual Claimants were not parties to the prior arbitration does not assist. This is because they are, and were at the time of the Prior Arbitration, RSM\u2019s three sole shareholders. They were thus privies of RSM at the time. As such, they, like RSM, are bound by those factual and other determinations regarding questions and rights arising out of or relating to the Agreement.\n\n7.1.6.\n\nOf course, RSM is a juridical entity with a legal personality separate from its three shareholders. But this does not alter the analysis. First, the Claimant shareholders\u2019 only investment is a contract to which RSM is a party and the shareholders are not: the shareholders seek compensation for damage they allege they have suffered indirectly, \"through RSM,\" for violations of RSM\u2019s legal rights.35 Second, the three individual Claimants collectively own 100% of RSM\u2019s stock and therefore entirely control the corporation. In these circumstances, we agree with Respondent, that there is nothing unfair in holding them to the results of RSM\u2019s Prior Arbitration.\n\nThe Request describes the investment as \"this Agreement [... ] clearly describes an \u2018investment\u2019 within the jurisdiction of ICSID. Claimants, *through RSM, have to date made an extensive investment in Grenada.* Request, at 5 (emphasis added).\n\n7.1.7.\n\nIt is true that shareholders, under many systems of law, may undertake litigation to pursue or defend rights belonging to the corporation. However, shareholders cannot use such opportunities as both sword and shield. If they wish to claim standing on the basis of their indirect interest in corporate assets, they must be subject to defences that would be available against the corporation - including collateral estoppel.\n\n*Questions Considered in the Prior Arbitration*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n7.1.8.\n\nIn the Prior Arbitration, the following findings pertaining to RSM and Grenada\u2019s rights and obligations under the Agreement arose out of questions that were put in issue and which had to be addressed to resolve the claims that were before the Prior Tribunal. They are thus binding on RSM, the individual Claimants and this Tribunal and may not be re-litigated in these proceedings.\n\n(a) Grenada did not breach any of its obligations towards RSM under the Agreement in failing to issue an exploration license to RSM, such obligation having lapsed on 28 March 2004 (Prior Award, If 503);\n\n(b) The Agreement was lawfully terminated by Grenada on 5 July 2005 so that Grenada thereafter had no further substantive contractual obligations to RSM (Prior Award, \u00b6 503);\n\n(c) RSM\u2019s 12 January 2004 letter to the Prime Minister terminated the period of *force majeure* and re-commenced the running of the 90-day period within which RSM had to apply for the exploration license (Prior Award, \u00b6\u00b6 173, 343-45);\n\n(d) The 14 days that had elapsed between the signing of the Agreement and RSM\u2019s invocation of *force majeure* counted towards the 90-day limit (Prior Award, 343-345);\n\n(e) Therefore, the 90-day period ended on 28 March 2004 (Prior Award, \u00b6 345);\n\n(f) RSM applied for an exploration license on either 13 or 14 April 2004, some two weeks after the 90-day period had expired (Prior Award, 203, 345);\n\n(g) RSM\u2019s Second Letter, of 22 February 2004, revoking force *majeure,* addressed to the \"Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Finance,\" was not delivered to Grenada until 14 April 2004. It was only seen by Senator Bowen after this date. (Prior Award, \u00b6 176 and \u00b6 186);\n\n(h) Because RSM\u2019s second letter was received by Grenada only on 14 April 2004, Grenada could not have deliberately kept silent before 28 March 2004, as a means of luring RSM into a trap. Thus, there could be no bad faith or other unconscionable conduct by Grenada in not responding to such letter before 28 March 2004. (Prior Award, \u00b6\u00b6 187-189);\n\n(i) It is manifestly clear from the terms of the Agreement that the timeliness of RSM\u2019s application was intended to be an important factor for the further performance of both parties\u2019 obligations under the Agreement. As a matter of contractual interpretation under the laws of Grenada, the obligation of RSM to make a timely application for an exploration license under Article 3.1 is a \"condition\" and a \"condition precedent\" of the Agreement, in the legal sense that RSM\u2019s failure to act timeously within the 90-day period relieves Grenada from any correlative obligation to proceed with further performance of its substantive obligations under the Agreement and also entitled Grenada to terminate the Agreement under Grenadian law (Prior Award, 376-377);\n\n(j) Under Article 3.1 of the Agreement, RSM was to be the sole master of its own application\u2019s timing within the 90-day period. This application depended on its will alone. It could choose when to make its application within the time period without any dependence on Grenada under the Agreement or the 1989 Act. It could make its application on the first day of the 90-day period. It did not need to wait until the end of this period, and there was thus no reason to delay the application to the end of this period (Prior Award, 372 to 374).\n\n*Article 53 of the ICSID Convention*\n------------------------------------\n\n7.1.9.\n\nThe Prior Tribunal had jurisdiction to construe the Agreement definitively, and it did so. That being so, the Tribunal concludes that to re-open the Prior Tribunal\u2019s findings would also violate Convention Article 53 which provides that \"the Award shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.\" The provisions of Article 26.4(b) of the Agreement are to the same effect.\n\n7.1.10.\n\nThe Tribunal also agrees with Respondent that the Convention\u2019s self-contained system of review is exclusive. That system - which RSM triggered by instituting annulment proceedings - does not permit *de novo* review of factual or legal findings by an annulment committee,36 let alone by a successor ICSID Tribunal.\n\n*Azurix Corporation v Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12), Decision on Application for Annulment (1 September 2009, at \u00b6\u00b6 41-42, Exhibit RLA-5.\n\n7.1.11.\n\nEven when the contractual forum is not an ICSID Tribunal, BIT tribunals do not reopen the municipal law decisions of competent *fora,* absent a denial of justice.\n\n7.1.12.\n\nThe *Helnan* Tribunal had to consider this exact question against a similar factual backdrop.37 There, the claimant contended that Egypt had breached the BIT by evicting it from the hotel it managed. However, a tribunal appointed pursuant to the arbitration clause in the underlying management contract, had already determined that the contract law had become \"impossible to execute\" and was therefore terminated pursuant to Egyptian law. As a result, the state party had no further contractual obligations to leave the claimant in possession of the premises.\n\n*Helnan International Hotels A/S v Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/19), Award, 3 July 2008, Exhibit RLA-14.\n\n7.1.13.\n\nIn dismissing *Helnan\u2019s* subsequently brought treaty claims, that ICSID Tribunal explained:\n\n*\"The Management Contract was terminated by the Cairo Award on 30 December 2004 pursuant to the arbitration clause included in the Management Contract. This award [...] is final and binding. It has been in force and has res judicata effects in the Egyptian legal order. As Egyptian law was applicable to the Management Contract, the present arbitral tribunal cannot ignore its effect, unless it would be established that rendering of the Award was made in breach of the Treaty, or general international law. \"38*\n\n*Helnan,* at \u00b6 6, Exhibit RLA-14.\n\n7.1.14.\n\nHaving regard to the fact similarity between this and the *Helnan* case, the Tribunal considers the reasoning in the *Hellnan* Award is persuasive and applicable here.\n\n*Article 51 of the ICSID Convention*\n------------------------------------\n\n7.1.15.\n\nAnother basis for review of an ICSID award is provided by Convention Article 51. That Article states that a party may request revision of an award by an application in writing addressed to the Secretary-General on the ground of *discovery of some fact of such a nature as decisively to affect the award,* provided that when the award was rendered, that fact was unknown to the tribunal and to the applicant, and that the applicant\u2019s ignorance of the fact was not due to negligence. Such an application is required to be made within 90 days after the discovery of such fact, and in any event, within three years after the date the award was rendered.\n\n7.1.16.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the fact that RSM had the possibility to obtain a revision of the Prior Award pursuant to this provision to be of importance in this case.\n\n7.1.17.\n\nIn their Opposition, Claimants allege that:\n\n*\"At the time RSM commenced* *the Prior ICSID Proceeding, RSM was not aware of the real reason why Grenada was refusing its license - in the following years RSM would slowly learn the details of Grenada\u2019s corrupt relationship with an entity called Global Petroleum Group, Ltd. \"39* (emphasis added)\n\nOpposition, \u00b6 23.\n\n7.1.18.\n\nAccepting the literal truth of this statement for the purposes of the Objection, *(i.e.,* that Grenada\u2019s alleged corruption was not known to RSM when it commenced the Prior Arbitration), it is nevertheless clear that by the time the Prior Arbitration came to a hearing in mid-June 2007, Claimants were aware of virtually everything they now rely on concerning Grenada\u2019s allegedly corrupt relationship with Global Petroleum.40\n\nIn the Prior Award, the Prior Tribunal deals with a complaint filed by RSM on 1 November 2006 (seven months before the hearing) in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York against Senator Bowen, and others, raising issues of corruption against them and claiming damages in excess of US$500 million. A review of the judgment of Judge Wallach in that case, filed on 19 February 2009, which summarises the facts alleged in Plaintiffs\u2019 Third Amended Complaint, indicates that, by at least November 2006, Claimants were aware of the substantial whole of the allegations of corruption relied on in this case.\n\n7.1.19.\n\nThe relevance of this to the question (dealt within the next Section of this Award), of whether Claimants\u2019 claims can survive in the face of the relevant findings of the Prior Tribunal, is that it was open to RSM to seek revision of those findings from the Prior Tribunal, based on evidence of corruption that was discovered thereafter. RSM sought no such revision.\n\n7.1.20.\n\nTo the extent that evidence of corruption was discovered following the close of proceedings at the end of the oral hearing, it was also open to RSM to seek to reopen those proceedings in order to introduce evidence of corruption that it wished the Prior Tribunal to consider in its analysis of whether Grenada had failed to fulfil its contractual obligations. Indeed, it sought to do so, but its application was denied because the new evidence would not have been decisive.41\n\nBy letters of 4 and 10 February 2009, RSM applied for the Prior Tribunal\u2019s permission to introduce into evidence certain new materials (corruption related) and to reopen the Prior Arbitration under Article 38 (2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal declined to do so, having concluded that the fresh evidence was not of such a nature as to constitute a decisive factor in the case. *See* Prior Award, \u00b6 38.\n\n7.1.21.\n\nSimilarly, to the extent evidence of corruption was known prior to the oral hearing, it was of course open to RSM to seek to have it considered.\n\n7.1.22.\n\nIn their Opposition, Claimants say that:\n\n*\"None of the facts* [set out in \u00b6\u00b6 24-43 of the Opposition] *were known by RSM when it instituted the Prior ICSID Proceeding, and none of these facts were adjudicated in the Prior ICSID Proceeding. Nor did the Prior ICSID Proceeding make any findings or conclusions with reference to the Treaty. \"*\n\n7.1.23.\n\nMs Orr went further in her oral submissions when she suggested that \"the facts concerning the bribery and the fraud issues were specifically excluded from the prior - - by the prior panel.\" And although she backed away from this assertion when its accuracy was tested by the Tribunal,42 the statement in the Opposition leaves an inaccurate impression that the factual underpinnings to Claimants\u2019 present corruption allegations were neither before the Prior Tribunal, nor used by RSM in its contractual breach case.\n\nTranscript, 160/22 - 162/11.\n\n7.1.24.\n\nAs noted above, the Prior Tribunal had been provided with the formal court documents submitted by RSM in the New York State corruption proceedings it had instituted against Senator Bowen (and others) on 1 November 2006, just one year after it initiated the Prior Arbitration, and well before the submission of RSM\u2019s written Reply submissions and testimony. These documents make clear that RSM had knowledge at that time of the facts alleged in 24-32 of the Opposition. And the rest of the facts relating to corruption (Opposition, 33-40) relied on by Claimants were known by RSM before the issue of the Prior Award: *i.e.,* either by the time of the prior oral hearing or when it sought to have the Prior Tribunal reopen proceedings in February 2009.\n\n7.1.25.\n\nMore importantly, RSM sought to rely on its allegations of corruption.43 In the Prior Award, the Prior Tribunal states plainly that:\n\n*\"211. Senator Bowen:*  *RSM impugned the honesty* *and competence of*  *Senator Bowen, both in these arbitration proceedings* *and, to a much greater extent in formal court documents submitted in the New York Proceedings and supplied to the Tribunal in these proceedings.*\n\n*212.*  *On all the evidence adduced in these arbitration proceedings, the Tribunal does not accept any of these personal criticisms of Senator Bowen* *for the purposes of its decision in this Award. Moreover, after a firm but fair cross-examination of Senator Bowen during the Main Hearings, RSM\u2019s Counsel submitted in his closing oral submissions that RSM was not requesting the Tribunal, in these proceedings, to find Senator Bowen \"corrupt\" or \"incompetent\"[...]. Nor does it.\"44* (emphasis added)\n\nAt the hearing, counsel for RSM put it to Senator Bowen that he had accepted a bribe from Global Petroleum in relation to an oil exploration contract by Grenada. Senator Bowen denied this allegation, but confirmed that Global Petroleum had provided Grenada with $2.5 million in order to fund the arbitration proceedings. Prior Arbitration, Merits Hearing, Transcript, Day 4, pages 44-45.\n\nPrior Award, \u00b6\u00b6 211-212. Exhibit R-l.\n\n7.1.26.\n\nThe fact that in his closing speech RSM\u2019s counsel took the position that he was not asking the Prior Tribunal formally to find Senator Bowen to be \"corrupt\" does not meant that RSM was not asking for its allegations of bribery not to be considered. Rather, RSM\u2019s counsel made it abundantly clear that RSM\u2019s allegations of corruption levied against Senator Bowen, and the answers he gave during cross-examination, *were relevant to and should be considered by the Prior Tribunal* as regards the credibility of Senator Bowen\u2019s testimony, not least as to the date of Grenada\u2019s receipt of RSM\u2019s Second letter.45\n\nPrior Arbitration, Merits Hearing, Transcript, Day 5, pages 49-50, as quoted in the Decision on RSM Production Corporation\u2019s Application for a Preliminary Ruling of 29 October 2009 **(\"Committee Decision\"),** at\u00a0\u00b6 6, Exhibit R-10.\n\n7.1.27.\n\nIn the light of these circumstances, Claimants\u2019 statements that... \"here the second proceeding is necessary precisely because Grenada chose to conceal the corrupt relationship between Global Petroleum and its former government officials,\" and \"Claimants have chosen to interpose Treaty claims because it is now clear that Grenada had a corrupt motive for refusing of RSM\u2019s license,\" suggest a much more recent discovery of Grenada\u2019s alleged corruption than is, in fact, the case.46\n\nOpposition, \u00b6 40.\n\n7.1.28.\n\nFor the purposes of the Objection, it is also apparent that RSM had sufficient evidence of alleged corruption to institute New York State court proceedings in 2006, and thus could have, but declined formally to put corruption in issue, as such, before the Prior Tribunal. To the extent that further evidence of corruption became available after the issue of the Prior Award, RSM could also have sought revision of that award under the provisions of Article 51. It did not, but instead instituted annulment proceedings.\n\n7.1.29.\n\nAt the first procedural hearing convened by the *ad hoc* Committee on 16 October 2009, RSM applied to have the Committee investigate suspicions of corruption in connection with Grenada\u2019s refusal of RSM's exploration license. In its written application of 29 October 2009, RSM sought to show that its license application had been denied, and the Agreement terminated by Grenada, by reasons of bribes paid and to be paid to Senator Bowen by Global Petroleum.47\n\nCommittee Decision, \u00b6\u00b6 1-4, Exhibit R-10.\n\n7.1.30.\n\nThe Committee denied RSM\u2019 application for a number of reasons, including the fact that the allegations made by RSM did not fall within any of the grounds for annulment enumerated in Convention Article 52. In rendering its decision, the Committee noted that:\n\n(a) The Prior Tribunal had the exclusive power in the post-award phase to rectify, revise, supplement or interpret the Prior Award;\n\n(b) RSM was asking the Committee to consider and investigate evidence that was available before the Prior Tribunal, and additional evidence led in RSM\u2019s New York State court\u2019s proceeding; and\n\n(c) The evidence of corruption relied upon by RSM \"was also obtained by it prior to the delivery of the Award, and, in one case, prior to the Merits Hearing. In the case of the evidence obtained after the Merits Hearing, if the Applicant had good grounds to submit that this was new evidence decisively relevant to the issues in the arbitration, then, even if the Tribunal had closed the proceedings, the Applicants could still have applied to the Tribunal to re-open the proceedings under ICSID Rule 38(1) \"48\n\nCommittee Decision, \u00b6 28.\n\n7.2 **Merit of Claimants\u2019 Claims**\n----------------------------------\n\n*Summary Conclusion*\n--------------------\n\n7.2.1.\n\nFor the reasons set out below, the Tribunal concludes that an essential predicate to the success of each of Claimants\u2019 claims is an ability for the Tribunal to re-litigate and decide in Claimants\u2019 favour conclusions of fact or law concerning the parties\u2019 contractual rights that have already distinctly been put in issue and distinctly determined by the Prior Tribunal. Because the Tribunal has concluded, in the answer to the first question it has considered, that it cannot properly revisit those conclusions, the Tribunal therefore finds that each of Claimants\u2019 claims is manifestly without legal merit. Accordingly, the Tribunal is obliged to dismiss each of Claimants\u2019 present claims.\n\n*Expropriation*\n---------------\n\n7.2.2.\n\nClaimants\u2019 case for expropriation is set out in four short paragraphs of the Request. Claimants\u2019 Opposition and subsequent oral submissions add nothing of substance. Paragraph 12 of the Request, contains the only description (allegations) of how the expropriation came about. This claim relies *exclusively* on Grenada\u2019s breach of the Agreement:\n\n(a) *\"By violating the Agreement and precluding RSM\u2019s filing of the application for exploration,* *Grenada\u2019s action constituted an actual and a de facto expropriation*\n\n(b) *\"the denial of the application and the resultant termination of the Agreement is a de facto expropriation*\n\n(c) *\"Grenada\u2019s action* [the breaches of the Agreement spelled out above] *forecloses the possibility that Claimants could enjoy the benefits of their investment. \"*\n\n7.2.3.\n\nBased on the Prior Tribunal\u2019s findings, Claimants\u2019 expropriation claim must therefore fail. The Prior Tribunal\u2019s conclusions that: (a) Grenada was not in breach of the Agreement; (b) RSM, which was the sole master of its own application\u2019s timing, had failed to file in a timely fashion; (c) RSM\u2019s filing within the prescribed time limit was a condition precedent to Grenada\u2019s further obligations; and (d) Grenada was entitled under Grenadian law to terminate the Agreement, preclude any possible finding of expropriation under the Treaty.\n\n7.2.4.\n\nIn paragraph 12, of the Request, Claimants allege that Grenada determined to cancel the Agreement \"to benefit itself and its apparent new investors, Global Petroleum Group of Russia [...].\" This proposition, that Grenada\u2019s behaviour was motivated by its allegedly corrupt dealings with Global Petroleum was developed in Claimants\u2019 Opposition and during the first meeting, but Claimants never alleged that Grenada did anything that affected Claimants\u2019 investment that it was not entitled to do under the Agreement.\n\n7.2.5.\n\nAccepting all of Claimants\u2019 allegations of the corruption of Grenadian officials at face value, they cannot, as described, constitute a Treaty breach. At their highest, they allege the acceptance of bribes by Grenadian official to grant Global Petroleum rights that RSM *might have acquired,* had it filed its application in a timely fashion. But it is nowhere credibly alleged (bearing in mind the findings of the Prior Tribunal) that Grenada \"acted\" in any way improperly in connection with RSM\u2019s loss of its contractual rights. Indeed, the Prior Tribunal has definitively determined that RSM lost its ability to explore because of its own failings, none of which can be laid at Grenada\u2019s doorstep, the alleged corruption notwithstanding. Given the Prior Tribunal\u2019s binding factual determination that Grenada acted properly in terminating the Agreement, its allegedly-bad motive for standing firm and asserting its contractual rights simply cannot support Claimants\u2019 invitation to ignore that settled determination.\n\n7.2.6.\n\nIf proven, Claimants corruption allegations, would certainly show that certain Grenadian government officials had acted unlawfully under Grenadian and international law (the acceptance of a bribe being unlawful under both), but such unlawful behaviour, by itself, does not amount to a Treaty violation.\n\n7.2.7.\n\nFor Claimants to succeed on a claim for the violation of Treaty Articles II or III, they must allege that Grenada took active steps to do as it was improperly bidden (something more than simply relying on its contractual rights), which steps could amount to a breach of the Treaty. However, no such allegations are made.\n\n*Arbitrary, Discriminatory and Illegal Behaviour*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n7.2.8.\n\nGrenada\u2019s allegation of breach of Treaty Article II (2), based on arbitrary, discriminatory and illegal behaviour, is set out in paragraph 16 of the Request. There Claimants rely on: (a) Grenada\u2019s \"contrived counting procedure which defies fact, logic and the law\"; (b) its \"failure to respond to Claimants\u2019 letter of 27 February for two (2) months, until the potential deadline had past [... ]\"; and (c) \"Grenada\u2019s action [...] enriched the Russian Global Petroleum for its own ends and thereby discriminated against the significant investments of American Claimants.\"49\n\nArguably, this latter allegation may refer to a claim for a breach of Treaty Article II (l)\u2019s most favoured nation standard and we will also consider it as such.\n\n7.2.9.\n\nThe difficulty with this claim, as with the claim for expropriation, is that it too relies entirely on this Tribunal\u2019s ability to retry RSM\u2019s contractual case, which it may not do.\n\n7.2.10.\n\nThe Prior Tribunal\u2019s findings that Grenada\u2019s calculations were not contrived or illogical, but were correct, are binding, as are its findings that Grenada could not possibly have responded to RSM\u2019s 27 February letter before the deadlines had passed.\n\n7.2.11.\n\nAs to the claim that Grenada discriminated against RSM and in favour of Global Petroleum, there is simply no credible allegation of fact to support it. Claimants, though Ms Orr, accepted that their investment is the Agreement.50 And, as found by the Prior Tribunal, the Agreement was lawfully terminated on 5 July 2005 (leaving Grenada with no further substantive contractual obligation to RSM). Claimants admit that it was some three years before Global Petroleum was issued with an offshore exploration license by Grenada in June 2008 and by this time, Claimants\u2019 investment had long been lawfully terminated as a result of RSM\u2019s own non compliance with the condition precedent to its right to acquire an exploration license.51 Thus, when Grenada eventually, as alleged, awarded Global petroleum a license, Claimants no longer had an investment against which Grenada could be said to have discriminated.\n\nTranscript, 157/12-15.\n\nOpposition, \u00b6 40.\n\n*Breach of International Law Standard of Treatment*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n7.2.12.\n\nClaimants\u2019 case based on treatment allegedly not in accordance with the standard required by applicable international law (in breach of Article 11 (2)) is dealt with in paragraphs 17-20 of the Request. Like their other claims, here Claimants also rely exclusively on breach of, or inappropriate behaviour by Grenada in connection with the Agreement.\n\n7.2.13.\n\nClaimants say that Grenada\u2019s position, that their application was untimely, \"is contrary to the terms of the Agreement, international law and Grenadian law, and is in breach [...] of the Treaty.\" But as discussed above, the Prior Tribunal has held otherwise as regards breach of the Agreement under Grenadian law.\n\n7.2.14.\n\nClaimants next allegations, of Grenada\u2019s \"confabulated system of counting,\" and that \"time is of the essence only if it is explicitly so stated in the contract, which is clearly not the case here,\" fall foul of the Prior Tribunal\u2019s explicit finding that Grenada counted the 90-day period correctly and that time was indeed of the essence - compliance with the 90-day application period being a condition of the Agreement.\n\n7.2.15.\n\nBased, as they are, only on Grenada\u2019s breach of the Agreement, for them to succeed would again require a re-litigation of facts and issue that have already been definitively determined in favour of Grenada. Accordingly, they cannot possibly succeed in the present proceeding.\n\n*Claimants\u2019 Non-receipt of Full Protection and Security*\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n7.2.16.\n\nClaimants full protection and security claim relies on one assertion - that Respondent \"failed to timely respond to Claimants\u2019 letter [Second Letter] to refute its logical and factual calculation of the relevant time period, it failed to provide Claimant any leeway with respect to its calculation of the filing deadline [...], and it arbitrarily rejected the application which it was bound to accept under the terms of the Agreement.\"\n\n7.2.17.\n\nThis claim, like those before it, cannot survive the Prior Tribunal\u2019s findings that Grenada received the Second Letter only after the 90-day deadline had expired and thus could not have responded in sufficient time to enable a timely filing.\n\n7.2.18.\n\nMoreover, Claimants\u2019 loss of their contractual rights was entirely of RSM\u2019s own doing. The Prior Tribunal specifically rejected any suggestion that Grenada decided \"not to respond as a means of luring RSM into a trap\" when it found that \"there could be no bad faith or other unconscionable conduct by Grenada in not responding to such letter before 28 March 2004 [the deadline].\"52\n\nPrior Award, \u00b6 189, Exhibit R-l.\n\n7.2.19.\n\nIn these circumstances, it would be impossible for this Tribunal to conclude in the present proceedings that Grenada arbitrarily rejected Claimants\u2019 late application, or that, by relying on its own contractual rights (without abusing those rights, e.g., by luring Claimants into a trap), its \"failure to provide Claimant any leeway\" on RSM\u2019s filing deadline could constitute a Treaty breach.\n\n*Claimants Were Not Treated Fairly and Equitably*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n7.2.20.\n\nThis claim is given the shortest treatment of any in the Request. Grenada\u2019s failure to meet the Treaty\u2019s fair and equitable standard is again based on its denial of Claimants\u2019 license application. Grenada and its agents are said to have placed personal gain over their obligations under the Treaty. The problem with this is that, in the absence of credible alleged abuse by Grenada of RSM\u2019s rights under the Agreement, Grenada\u2019s reliance on RSM\u2019s failure to fulfill a required pre-condition for the award of a license cannot reasonably be said to breach the Treaty\u2019s fair and equitable standard.\n\n7.2.21.\n\nThis is because Claimants lost their investment as a result of RSM\u2019s own actions (or inactions). As the Prior Tribunal has found, RSM was the sole master of its own application\u2019s timing and Grenada did absolutely nothing to influence RSM\u2019s timing. Put another way, assuming it to be true that a senior official or senior officials were bribe takers from Global Petroleum, this/these corrupt acts were not causative of the loss of Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n7.2.22.\n\nThe taking of any such bribe was unlawful, but Grenada\u2019s decision to rely on its contractual rights cannot be said to contravene the unfair and inequitable standard as it has so far been understood by multiple ICSID Tribunals.\n\n7.2.23.\n\nGrenada\u2019s decision to rely on RSM\u2019s failure to file timeously was in no way arbitrary, it involved no absence of due process, there was no absence of transparency and it did not discriminate by treating another party in a similar position to RSM more favourably *(i.e.,* by forgiving a failure of such a party to meet a condition precedent to the exercise of its rights) than RSM.\n\n7.2.24.\n\nAs was recognised by the *CMS* Tribunal, the fair and equitable treatment standard is an objective, not subjective one. Breach of the standard is \"unrelated to whether the Respondent has had any deliberate intention or bad faith in adopting the measures in question.53\n\n*CMS Gas Transportation Company v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/8), Award, 12 May 2005, \u00b6 208.\n\n7.2.25.\n\nIn these circumstances, even if Grenada was motivated, by bribes, to offer its off-shore exploration rights to Global Petroleum, its reliance on its contractual rights to terminate the Agreement cannot be said to infringe the fair and equitable standard when Grenada had done nothing to induce RSM\u2019s failure to file its application within the time limits the parties had agreed.\n\n7.3 **Fork in the Road Clause / Abuse of Process**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n7.3.1.\n\nHaving concluded that Claimants\u2019 claims cannot succeed in the face of the findings by the Prior Tribunal concerning RSM\u2019s and Grenada\u2019s contractual rights and the facts underpinning those findings, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to decide whether the Treaty\u2019s fork-in-the-road clause constitutes a legal impediment to the assertion of their claims, such that Respondent\u2019s Objection should prevail, and we do not do so.\n\n7.3.2.\n\nNevertheless, even if it could be said that the parties to the present dispute \"had not been submitted by the national or company for resolution in accordance with any applicable previously agreed dispute settlement procedures\" (Treaty Article VI(3)), the Tribunal considers the initiation of the present proceedings, in which Claimants admittedly seek redetermination of the Prior Tribunal\u2019s contractual findings, to be impermissible in the face of the ICSID Convention\u2019s self-contained and exclusive system of review.\n\n7.3.3.\n\nAs noted in Section 6 above, RSM was aware of virtually all of the facts upon which they now allege corruption before the completion of pleadings in the Prior Arbitration, and it clearly sought to rely on allegations of bribery to impugn the testimony of Senator Bowen regarding the date on which Grenada received RSM\u2019s Second Letter.\n\n7.3.4.\n\nClaimants also received Mr Leyton\u2019s declaration (confirming Mr Melnicke\u2019s statements to Mr Grynberg) within six months of the June 2007 oral hearings, and subsequently sought, unsuccessfully, to introduce new evidence into the prior proceedings.\n\n7.3.5.\n\nFollowing receipt of the Prior Award, which dealt adversely with its case, and rather than attempting to seek its revision and rectification pursuant to Convention Article 51, RSM initiated annulment proceedings under Convention Article 52. It later abandoned those proceedings after the denial of its application for an investigation by the annulment committee of whether Grenada had denied RSM\u2019s license application based on bribes received from Global Petroleum.\n\n7.3.6.\n\nIt is true that Claimants style the present arbitration as Treaty claim based. But the difficulty with this is that, as pleaded and argued, the present case is no more than an attempt to re-litigate and overturn the findings of another ICSID tribunal, based on allegations of corruption that were either known at the time or which ought to have been raised by way of a revision application and over which the Prior Tribunal had jurisdiction.\n\n7.3.7.\n\nClaimants\u2019 present case is thus no more than a contractual claim (previously decided by an ICSID tribunal which had the jurisdiction to deal with Treaty and contractual issues), dressed up as a Treaty case. Having regard to all that has gone before, the Tribunal finds that the initiation of the present arbitration is thus an improper attempt to circumvent the basic principles set out in Convention Article 53 and the procedures available for revision and rectification of awards provided for in Article 51.\n\n**8. COSTS**\n------------\n\n8.1 **Parties\u2019 Requests for Costs**\n-----------------------------------\n\n8.1.1.\n\nIn its Objection, Grenada seeks, *inter alia,* an award ordering Claimants to pay all costs and fees of this arbitration, including the administrative fees and costs of ICSID, the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and Grenada\u2019s legal and other costs.\n\n8.1.2.\n\nDuring the course of the first meeting, when dealing with agenda item 3 -\"Apportionment of Costs and Advance Payments to the Centre (Convention Article 61; Administrative and Financial Regulation 14; Arbitration Rule 28),\" the parties were each asked, if they were to prevail, whether the Tribunal should award legal and other costs to date of this arbitration in their favour. Each confirmed that such an award of, or order for costs was sought.54\n\nTranscript, 14/11, 15/10\n\n8.1.3.\n\nThe parties having both sought an award of costs in relation to the Objection and, because of its potentially determinative effect on the arbitration, the Tribunal, on 27 October 2010, requested the parties to submit their respective statements of costs by 3 November 2010 (providing sufficient details as to time spent, work and personnel involved, and charge out rates, to enable assessment), and to submit their comments, if advised, on each other\u2019s costs\u2019 statements by 8 November 2010. This request was made without prejudice to the Tribunal\u2019s decision on the outcome of the Objection.\n\n8.2 **Parties\u2019 Claims for Costs**\n---------------------------------\n\n8.2.1.\n\nIn response to the Tribunal\u2019s request, each of the parties submitted statements of costs, as requested, on 3 November 2010.\n\n8.2.2.\n\nClaimants sought an award of cost in the amount of US$ 31,092.50, of which US$ 27,292.50 was attributed to the objection and US$ 3,800.00 was attributable to the Security Application.\n\n8.2.3.\n\nRespondent sought an award of costs in the amount of USS 330,126.83, less any portion of the advance refunded to it by ICSID, plus interest at a rate of 3.25%, compounded semi-annually from the date of any Award in its favour until the date of full payment. Its claim for costs was limited to costs incurred for the Objection. The sum sought included US$ 201,210.00 for legal fees, US$ 3,916.83 for disbursements and US$ 125,000.00 for its share of the advance payment to ICSID.\n\n8.3 **Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Costs**\n------------------------------------\n\n8.3.1.\n\nConvention Article 61(2) requires a tribunal, except as the parties otherwise agree, to assess the expenses incurred by the parties in conjunction with the proceedings, and to decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision is required to form part of any award.\n\n8.3.2.\n\nRule 28(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which governs the costs of proceedings, provides that:\n\n*\"Promptly after the closure of the proceeding, each party shall submit to the Tribunal a statement of costs reasonably incurred or borne by it in the proceeding and the Secretary-General shall submit to the Tribunal an account of all amounts paid by each party to the Centre and of all costs incurred by the Centre for the proceeding. The Tribunal may, before the award has been rendered, request the Parties and the Secretary-General to provide additional information concerning the costs of the proceeding. \"*\n\n8.3.3.\n\nThe Secretary-General has advised the Tribunal that the costs of the arbitration, which include *inter alia,* the arbitrators\u2019 fees, the expenses of the Tribunal, and the Secretariat\u2019s administration fees and expenses, at the time of the Award, amount to USS 187,315.94.\n\n8.3.4.\n\nIn this case, each of the parties has asked the Tribunal to exercise its discretion under Article 61, based on the principle that such costs should follow the event. Having regard to its\u2019 conclusions that Claimants present claims are manifestly without legal merit, and that, it was impermissible for Claimants to advance them in new ICSID proceedings, the Tribunal considers it appropriate that Respondent should be fully indemnified for all of its costs, reasonably incurred or borne, in this proceeding.\n\n8.3.5.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed with care Respondent\u2019s statement of costs, and determines that its legal costs in the amount of USS 205,126.83 are reasonable and should be reimbursed by Claimants.\n\n8.3.6.\n\nIn addition, Claimants shall be liable for 100% of the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal, and 100% of the administrative fees and expenses of the Centre, in the amount of USS 187,315.94.\n\n**9. OPERATIVE PART**\n---------------------\n\n9.1.\n\nAccordingly, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal DECLARES, CONFIRMS, ORDERS and AWARDS that:\n\n(a) each of Claimants\u2019 claims set out in its Request for Arbitration of 15 January 2010, and as further described in Claimants\u2019 Opposition of 30 August 2010, and in Claimants\u2019 oral submissions made on 25 October 2010, is manifestly without legal merit within the meaning of Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and is hereby dismissed;\n\n(b) Claimants shall pay to Respondent its legal and other costs of these proceedings in the amount of US$ 205,126.83.\n\n(c) Claimants shall pay to Respondents USS 93,605.62, being its unrefunded share of the advance against costs paid to the Centre to cover the costs of the first phase of these proceedings.\n\n(d) Each of the sums awarded in (b) and (c) above shall bear interest at a rate of 3.25%, compounded semi-annually from the date of this Award until the date of full payment."}]}
