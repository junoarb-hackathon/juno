Background**\n-----------------\n\n1.\n\nThe Tribunal's Procedural Order No. 1 foresaw that, in an initial phase of the proceeding, the Respondent would file its objections to jurisdiction and admissibility and any counter-claim (13.1.3 of the Order), and that the parties would file submissions on whether or not any possible objections to jurisdiction and admissibility should be bifurcated from the merits of the case (13.1.4 of the Order). Procedural Order No. 1 further anticipated that, if the parties did not agree on bifurcation, the Tribunal would, following a telephone conference with the parties, decide the matter. Depending on the Tribunal's decision, either of two separate scenarios of pleading schedules would ensue (13.1.6-9 of the Order).\n\n2.\n\nPursuant to the procedural calendar, on July 15, 2013, the Respondent filed Preliminary Objections, a Counter-Memorial and a Counterclaim. The Respondent's Preliminary Objections consisted of objections to ICSID jurisdiction and a defense of time-bar under the substantive applicable law.\n\n3.\n\nOn July 31, 2013, the Claimants filed a Reply Memorial on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction and on the Admissibility of the Counterclaim. While the Claimants objected to the jurisdiction and admissibility of the Counterclaim, they requested that all objections to jurisdiction and admissibility raised by the parties be joined to the merits of the case and that the Tribunal adopt Scenario B at paragraph 13.3 of Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n4.\n\nOn August 23, 2013, the Respondent filed its Submission on Bifurcation of the Proceedings, requesting that the Tribunal order the bifurcation of the proceedings and the adoption of Scenario A at paragraph 13.2 of Procedural Order No. 1. It also requested the suspension of the proceeding on the merits, pending the resolution of its preliminary objections.\n\n5.\n\nOn September 9, 2013, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the parties concerning the possible bifurcation of the proceeding, during which the parties confirmed their positions. The Tribunal asked the parties for their views on a third option which in its view would constitute a compromise solution. As an alternative to a bifurcation of the Respondent's preliminary objections and the Claimants' objections to the admissibility and jurisdiction of the Counterclaim from the merits of the case, the Tribunal presented a scenario in which the parties' preliminary objections would be joined to issues of liability, bifurcated from issues of quantum (i.e. any matters relating to the compensation sought as a result of the Respondent's liability for the Claimants' claims and the Claimants' liability for the Respondent's counterclaim). The Tribunal further suggested that the schedule in Scenario B could in essence be adopted with the necessary amendments to exclude briefs on quantum. If the Tribunal were to dismiss the parties' objections as to jurisdiction/admissibility and find liability in regard to their respective claims or counterclaim, the Tribunal, in consultation with the parties, would decide upon a timetable for a quantum phase.\n\n6.\n\nThe Respondent's position on bifurcation can be summarized as follows: If the preliminary objections are *prima facie* grounded, they must be considered as preliminary matters, since a possible upholding of such objections would lead to the disposal of the case without entering into the merits. In this case, the four objections to jurisdiction and defense of time-bar must be found to be *prima facie* substantial and are strong arguments in favor of dismissal of the case. Therefore, reasons of procedural economy compel bifurcation of the jurisdictional and admissibility objections from the merits of the case. Each of the preliminary objections are distinct from the merits of the case and may be analyzed separately without prejudging in any manner the decision on the merits. A bifurcation of the proceedings would simplify the resolution of the jurisdictional and admissibility issues, giving the parties the opportunity to properly present their cases regarding preliminary matters. During the telephone conference, the Respondent stated that it could only accept Scenario A, recalling its arguments for a bifurcated proceeding confined to preliminary objections. It therefore did not approve the alternative scenario presented by the Tribunal.\n\n7.\n\nThe Claimants' position on bifurcation can be summarized as follows: The Respondent's preliminary objections are clearly *prima facie* / *ictu oculi* without basis if not frivolous. Consequently, procedural economy warrants that they be joined to the merits of the case. Bifurcation would unnecessarily extend the length of the proceedings. Although the Claimants have strong objections in regard to the admissibility and jurisdiction of the Respondent's Counterclaim, these objections may also be joined to the merits. The Claimants found the scenario presented by the Tribunal during the telephone conference acceptable.\n\n**II. Tribunal's Decision**\n---------------------------\n\n8.\n\nArticle 41(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:\n\n*Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.*\n\n9.\n\nThe Parties do not disagree that the Tribunal has discretion to decide whether or not to bifurcate the proceedings.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered both parties' arguments for and against bifurcation, as well as their pleadings filed to date. In particular, the Tribunal notes the Respondent's remark at paragraph 22 of its Submission on Bifurcation that \"*the determination of the issues raised on the merits, especially (but not only) of the issues related to the Quantum implies necessarily the production of expert evidence by both parties, thus in fact increasing both the duration and cost of the proceedings.*\" The Tribunal also notes, as did the Respondent at paragraph 24 of its Submission on Bifurcation, that the difference in time between Scenario A and B is approximately two months.\n\n11.\n\nIt was in this light that the Tribunal presented its compromise solution during the telephone conference with the parties. It agrees with the Respondent that the preparation of submissions on quantum may be time consuming and costly, and that oral arguments and examination of experts may require a longer hearing. At the same time, the Tribunal is of the view that the preliminary objections are intertwined with issues of liability and would thus be greatly assisted by a joint proceeding on preliminary objections and liability. It notes in this respect that the parties have already filed a Memorial and Counter-Memorial on liability.\n\n12.\n\nConsidering the short delay of two months compared with the benefits of hearing the preliminary objections with the issues of liability, the Tribunal is of the view that procedural fairness and efficiency would be better served without bifurcation as between jurisdiction/admissibility and liability. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides to join the parties' preliminarily objections to issues of liability, and to bifurcate issues of quantum to a further stage of the proceedings, if applicable. The proceeding on the merits is therefore not suspended under ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(3).\n\n13.\n\nHaving regard to the above, the Tribunal decides to adopt the following timetable:\n\ni. The Claimants shall file a Reply on Liability and a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction/Admissibility and the Counter-Claim by Friday, November 29, 2013 ;\n\nii. The Respondent shall file a Rejoinder on Liability and a Reply on Jurisdiction/Admissibility and the Counter-Claim by March 31, 2014 ;\n\niii. The Claimants shall file a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction/Admissibility and the Counter-Claim by Tuesday, April 30, 2014 ;\n\niv. The Tribunal shall hold an organizational pre-hearing telephone conference on Monday, May 12, 2014 at 3 p.m., Brussels time, 2 p.m. London time, 4 p.m. Bucharest time ; and\n\nv. A hearing on jurisdiction/admissibility and liability will be held in Paris the week of June 2, 2014 (while the whole week is reserved, the exact amount of days will be determined in due course)."}, {"Title": "Decision on Jurisdiction, Admissibility and Liability", "Type": "Liability", "Date": "2015-04-21T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting opinion by arbitrator Mauro Rubino-Sammartano", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": "2015-04-21T00:00:00Z", "Content": "Dissenting opinion by arbitrator Mauro Rubino-Sammartano\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Summary of the proceedings**\n------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThese proceedings were introduced by a Request for arbitration filed by Claimant with ICSID on 23 July 2012.\n\n2.\n\nThe above Arbitral Tribunal was constituted.\n\n3.\n\nThe parties have exchanged pleadings.\n\n4.\n\nProcedural Orders have been issued.\n\n5.\n\nBy Procedural Order no. 2, the Tribunal has decided to join the Respondent\u2019s objections to jurisdiction, and Claimant\u2019s objections to the counter claim by Respondents, to issues of liability and to bifurcate issues of quantum to a further stage of the proceedings.\n\n6.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and liability took place at the ICC Hearing Centre in Paris from 2 to 5 June 2014.\n\n7.\n\nBased oh Procedural Order no. 5, the parties have filed their post hearing briefs.\n\n8.\n\nThe first part of the proceedings resulting from the above bifurcation was completed with the post-hearing briefs and the parties\u2019 submissions on costs, and the Tribunal has since deliberated on the issues before it.\n\n9.\n\nThe facts and contentions of the parties and their claims and counterclaims are described in the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal has unanimously decided in favour of its jurisdiction over the claims, and has held by a majority that there is no jurisdiction over Respondent\u2019s counterclaim.\n\n11.\n\nThe Tribunal has unanimously decided to dismiss Claimants\u2019 claims that Romania would have breached the principle of observance of the right to defence, the principle of contradiction, the Claimants\u2019 due process right, under art. 2(5) of the BIT between Italy and Romania, whereby each Party has undertaken to provide effective means of \"asserting claims and enforcing rights\" and that Romania would have committed a denial of justice and an abuse of rights contrary to good faith.\n\n12.\n\nIn my opinion the other claims by Claimants may not be heard by our Tribunal on the following grounds.\n\n**Reasons of the dissent**\n--------------------------\n\n1.\n\nI have asked the Tribunal to consider and the Tribunal has extensively considered the impact upon the present proceedings of the judgment of the Bucharest Court of Appeals of 16 March 2011 in *AVAS v. Marco Gavazzi and Stefano Gavazzi* (which was confirmed by the Court of Cassation of Romania). The Bucharest Court of Appeals first set aside the 2007 Romanian Award, then, on 16 March 2011 issued a decision on the merits and rejected the counterclaim made by Messrs Gavazzi, which was based on conduct and omissions by A VAS, stemming from nonpostponement of payments and no waiver of debts of the Company acquired by the Gavazzis. The Court of Appeals found that the Gavazzis were not entitled to such rescheduling and waiver because they were in breach of their commitments to AVAS, and that AVAS was consequently not liable to them for its conduct and omissions.\n\n2.\n\nThe impact of a state court judgment on international arbitral proceedings (not subject to the domestic law of the former) has to be considered in these circumstances.\n\n3.\n\nForeign judgments are granted effect outside of their jurisdiction on the ground of several principles such as comity, efficiency and to avoid conflicts between decisions1.\n\nHock Lai Ho, *Policies Underlying the Enforcement for Foreign Commercial Judgment* (1997) 46 ICLQ 445,\n\n4.\n\nForeign judgments are recognized in another jurisdiction if they comply with requirements, which are also referred to as \"foreign judgments principles\", i.e. if they are made by a competent Court, such proceedings have not breached due process and they are not in breach of the forum\u2019s (in our case of international) public policy2.\n\nCheng Bin, *General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tr\u00efbunals* (1953) at 336. Silberman L., *Some judgments on judgments: a viens from America* (2008) 19 King\u2019s Lj 235, 237, 38; Einhorn T., *The Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments on International Commercial Arbitral Awards* (2010) 12 YB Priv. Int. L. 43; European Union, Parliament and Council Regulation no. 1215/2012 of December 12,\n\n5.\n\nThe effects produced by such foreign judgments include the doctrines of *res judicata* and/or issue estoppel (i.e. a preclusion to re-examination of a given issue, which has been decided in the foreign judgment).\n\n6.\n\nI will deal first with res judicata since it sets the frame of this analysis and then with issue estoppel.\n\n7.\n\nThe effects of *res judicata* have been dealt with extensively. *Res judicata* has been referred to as being one of the \"general principles of law recognized by civilised courts\"3.\n\nJudge Anzilotti\u2019s dissenting opinion in Chorzow v. *Factoring Case* (1977) PCI) (Scz. A), no. 11 at 27.\n\n8.\n\nIn the Unites States the Draft Restatement on International Commercial Arbitration provides that in post award proceedings foreign judgment principles (including issue estoppel) are to be applied in order to decide whether a US Court *\"may re-examine a matter decided at an earlier stage of* *the proceedings...by a foreign court\"4* and the Restatement (Second) Judgment \u00a7 84 equates the effects of decisions by state courts and arbitrators\n\n*\"[T]here is good reason to treat the determination of the issues in an arbitration proceeding as conclusive in a subsequent proceeding, just as determinations of a court would be so treated\".*\n\nRestatement (Third) of the U.S. Law of International Commercial Arbitration (Tentative Draft No. 2, 2012), \u00a7 4(8), Although the Draft Restatement concerns arbitration, it affirms a principle which in my opinion also applies to state court judgments.\n\n9.\n\nThere is a large consensus that a final judgment by a state court has *res judicata* effects. This matter has been long discussed amongst writers and by precedents5.\n\nG.

Prodim,* in *Rev. arb.,* 2009, at 655.\n\n10.\n\n*Res judicata* produces positive effects (that such decision is taken into account in other proceedings) and/or negative effects (i.e. it prevents that the matter which has been so decided be further litigated).\n\n11.\n\nThere is also large consensus that these effects are produced also in arbitration, not only when the seat of the arbitral proceedings is in the same jurisdiction where the final award was made, but also when the arbitral proceedings have a different seat and are governed by a different national law or just by international arbitration rules.\n\n12.\n\nIn the latter case, arbitrators having no *lex fori* do not strictly apply domestic procedural rules, but rather focus on principles like *effet utile* (efficiency of the proceedings), non-contradiction and consistency.\n\n13.\n\nIt has been held that ignoring the effects of *res judicata* would amount to a violation of public policy. While this argument may be used, in specific situations, as a specific ground for setting aside the award, it is suggested that the principles referred to in \u00a7 15 are more general and consequently may be applied to all situations.\n\n14.\n\nThe conditions required for the operations of *res judicata* are frequently held to consist in the triple identity test (same parties, subject matter and cause of action).\n\n15.\n\nHowever, Recommendation no. 4 of the International Law Association6, as to the conclusive and preclusive *res judicata* effects of a previous award (a concept which in my opinion may be applied also to a previous final state court judgment), refers to the facts of a final judgment by mentioning *\"issues of fact, or law\" \"provided any such determination was essential or fundamental to the dispositive part....\".* Reference has been made also to the *\"fait g\u00e9n\u00e9rateur de la responsabilit\u00e9\"* (the fact which has given rise to liability).\n\nInternational Law Association, Committee on International Commercial Arbitration, *Final Report and Recommendations on Res* *judicata in International Commercial Arbitration,* in *Arbitration International* 2009, at 83.\n\n16.\n\nIssue estoppel is to be distinguished from *res judicata* even if the two doctrines apply common basic principles.\n\n17.\n\nOne has to distinguish cause of action estoppel from issue estoppel, since the former prevents a party from resubmitting the same claim which was previously decided, while issue estoppel prevents a party from re-litigating a point of law or of fact which was already decided by a previous judgment.\n\n18.\n\nThe issue estoppel doctrine is applied less frequently than *res judicata* since some jurisdictions concentrate on *res judicata.*\n\n19.\n\nHowever, preclusion is a concept generally known to all jurisdictions. The effects of determination of issues by a previous judgment of a state court have then been dealt with7.\n\n*Owens Bank Ltd.* v. *Bracco* [1992], 2AC 443 (HL) and *House of Spring Gardens Ltd,* v. *Waite* \u00a11985] FSR 173 (CA). ; See also *Carl Zeiss Sliflung v. Rayner & Keeler Ltd.* No. 2 [1967] 1AC H53 (I IL),\n\n20.\n\nAlthough the Recommendations do not have binding effect, they are important guidelines.\n\n21.\n\nIssue estoppel does not invest the entire previous decision (claim, *causa petendi* and relief), but only the issues which have been decided by the final state court decision.\n\n22.\n\nIn my opinion, the conditions required in order to apply an issue estoppel are not as strict as those for *res judicata,* even if one does not accept the widening of the scope of *res judicata* under ILA\u2019s Recommendations, which examine the underlying nature of the dispute and are not based on formalistic concepts. To me the requirements for issue estoppel are the identity of the parties in both instances and identity of the facts and findings on which an issue is based (such as when the claims arise out of the same factual situation).\n\n23.\n\nAs to the identity of the parties in this case, it is my opinion that, under international law (and not only if one follows an economic approach), a State is liable for the conduct of its agencies and instrumentalities if they act pursuant to the sovereign authority of that State. Because of the attribution of the relevant acts to the State, there is a \"sufficient degree of identification between such parties\", *ie* between the agency and the State.8. As AVAS\u2019 acts and omissions are attributable to Romania, Romania must be considered as identical to AVAS. There is consequently identity of the parties in the two proceedings.\n\nP.R. BARNETT, *Res judicata, Estoppel and Foreign Judgments: The Preclusive Effects of Foreign Judgments in Private international Law,* Oxford University Press 2001, at 8.\n\n24.\n\nThe different causes of action in the two sets of proceedings (in the former it is a breach of contract and in the present proceedings it is a breach of the BIT) - if construed as the legal grounds of the claims - do not, in my opinion, prevent the application of issue estoppel.\n\n25.\n\nLikewise, even if the law to be applied in deciding the claims is different in the two proceedings (in the former proceedings it is Romanian law while in the present proceedings it is international law), in my opinion issue estoppel can be applied, because it does not affect the appreciation of the facts and of the findings on them, except when the application of domestic law gives a result which is materially different from the one under international law. I see no evidence in this dispute of a material difference arising from the application of these two laws.\n\n26.\n\nThe importance of the role of facts has been pointed out in several state court decisions.\n\n27.\n\nThe Swiss Federal Tribunal9 has held that\n\n*\"it is not necessary in principle to include the* causa petendi *(cause of action) in the object of the dispute, since the identity of the claim which have been made is the result of the requests for reliefs and of the facts alleged to base them,*  *in other words the ensemble of the facts on which such requests for relief* *... \",*\n\nand further\n\n*\"The authority of res judicata extends to all the facts which existed at the time of the first judgment\"* (note: the case concerned *res judicata* of another judgment).\n\nSwiss Federal Tribunal, judgment of 27 May 2014 (4A 508/2013).\n\n28.\n\nhave considered the following other precedents:\n\n*7.12... In Amco10, the tribunal decided: \"The general principle, announced in numerous cases is that a right, question,*  *or fact* *distinctly put in issue and distinctly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction as a ground of recovery, cannot be disputed. \"*\n\n*7.15... The Pious Fund11 tribunal (applying res judicata in the Permanent Court of Arbitration\u2019s first case and viewed as \"[t]he leading early case \") also applied a two-part test, emphasising that \"there are not only the same parties to the suit, but also the same subject-matter that was judged\" in a prior arbitral award.*\n\n*7.17... whether res judicata in international law includes the broader concept of or akin to issue estoppel, the principle that a party in subsequent proceedings*  *cannot contradict an issue of fact* *or law not reflected in the dispositif if it has already been* *distinctly raised and finally decided in earlier proceedings between the same parties (or their privies).*\n\n*7.18 It is clear that past international tribunals have applied forms of issue estoppel, without necessarily using the term. Umpire Plumley \u2019s award in Orinoco Steamship12 found that \"every matter and point distinctly in issue... and which was directly passed upon and determined in said decree, and which was its ground and basis, is confirmed by said judgment, and the claimants... are forever estopped from asserting any right or claim based in any part upon any fact actually and directly involved in the said decree. \" In Professor Lowe\u2019s opinion, the tribunal in then resubmitted*  *Amco case \"clearly applied the principle of issue estoppel to the determination of specific facts and of the legal haracterisations of facts by the previous tribunal* *. \" Most recently, the ICSID tribunal in Grynberg* v. *Grenada13 applied issue estoppel (albeit describing it as \"collateral estoppel \")*  *to foreclose the claimants\u2019 efforts to re-open issues decided in an award made in a prior ICSID arbitration* *.*\n\n*7.20 In so doing, the second tribunal accepted the respondent\u2019s submission of issue estoppel arising from the first award, to the effect that the legal and factual contentions on which the new claims depended had already been fully litigated in the first ICSID arbitration. Applying the doctrine to all four claimants as \"privies\" as a general principle of law recognised in Amco v Indonesia and the Orinoco case, the second ICSID tribunal accepted that \"a finding concerning a right, question*  *or fact may not be re-litigated* *(and, thus, is binding on a subsequent tribunal), if, in a prior proceeding: (a) it was distinctly put in issue; (b) the court or tribunal actually decided it; and (c) the resolution of the question was necessary to resolving the claims before that court or tribunal. \"*\n\n*7.25 The Permanent Court of International Justice was of like mind in Advisory Opinion No. 11: \"It is perfectly true that*  *all the parts of a judgment* *concerning the points in dispute*  *explain and complete* *each other and are to be taken into account in order to determine the precise meaning and scope of the operative portion. This is clearly slated in the award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration of October 14th, 1902, concerning the Pious Fund of the Californias... The Court agrees with this statement. \"*\n\n*7.31...As in the Pious Fund arbitration, tribunals have considered that \"all the parts of the judgment or the decree concerning the points debated in the litigation enlighten and mutually supplement each other. \"*\n\n(emphasis added)\n\n*Amco Asia Corp. v.

The subsequent facts are based on them.\n\n33.\n\nIn the Romanian  proceedings, it was held that the investors were not entitled to the rescheduling and to the waiver of debts since they were themselves in breach.\n\n34.\n\nIn my opinion, a final decision which has found that the investors were not entitled to the rescheduling and to the waiver, may not be re-litigated as to such finding, i.e. as to such issue.\n\n35.\n\nA litigant may not succeed on a treaty claim, based on a breach by the State (or a subdivision of it), stemming from a lack of rescheduling and of waiver of debts, when such conduct has been found, in an earlier final judgment for breach of contract, to be legitimate.\n\n36.\n\nThe above commentaries and precedents are in the sense that a party may not re-litigate issues which have been finally decided by a foreign court in compliance with foreign judgment principles.\n\n37.\n\nIn *Marriott* v. *Jnah18* it was held that the effects of *res judicata* are an issue of admissibility of the claim. In my opinion, the same conclusion applies also to issue estoppel and the parties themselves are prevented from re-litigating that issue. It follows from this that the \"second\" arbitral tribunal or state court may not readmit the issue.\n\nSee supra note 3, See also Court of Cassation (France), May 28, 2008, *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G et A Distribution* v. *Prodim, Rev. arb.,* 2008, at 461 ; Ch. JARROSSON, *L'autorit\u00e9 de chose jug\u00e9e des sentences arbitrales,* in *Proc\u00e9dures,* 2007, Etude 17, 27 et seq.\n\n38.\n\nIn my opinion this Tribunal is therefore bound by the decision of the Romanian Court of Cassation (which has confirmed the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Bucharest of 16 March 2011), which has finally decided the merits of the dispute.\n\n39.\n\nAll Claimants\u2019 claims for breach by Respondent of the Italy-Romania BIT, such as art. 2 (Fair and Equitable Treatment) and art. 4.1 (Nationalization and Expropriation), may consequently not be heard because of issue estoppel and are to be declared inadmissible.\n\n40.\n\nMy learned co-arbitrators have not shared this view.\n\n41.\n\nmust consequently dissent from the opinion of the majority of the Tribunal and disagree, on the above grounds, from paragraphs 163 to 174 of their Decision.\n\n42.\n\nalso dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion:\n\n(i) concerning jurisdiction on the Respondent\u2019s counter-claim for the following reasons:\n\n- the BIT, in the second paragraph of its Preamble, indicates that it aims at \"a *stable framework... and maximum effective utilization of economic resources of either country,\"* and, in Article 8(1), the BIT refers to *\"[a]ny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of that investor in the territory of the former Contracting Party\".*\n\n- Article 8(1) of the BIT suggests amicable consultation and negotiations with respect to \"[a]ny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor\", while Article 8(2) of the BIT only grants the investor the right to claim against the Host State.\n\n- The absence of an express mention in Article 8(2) that the Host State may claim against the investor has to be interpreted under Article 8(3),19 in the sense that the Host State may elaborate its defence against the investor\u2019s claim. The question then arises as to why the Host State should be limited to opposing the investor\u2019s claims and not be entitled to install a counterclaim.\n\n- The omission of any express mention of the Host State\u2019s right to file a counterclaim may be due to the fact that the drafters of the BIT focused on the protection of the investor. One has then to consider whether this omission excludes any counterclaim by the Host State against the investor before the arbitration forum provided for by the BIT.\n\n- Art. 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of its Arbitration Rules provide for counterclaims.\n\n- The Respondent\u2019s counterclaim is for damages caused by the investor, which arise from the investment - or more precisely the failure of investments - and thus allegedly from the same subject matter as the Parties\u2019 dispute.\n\n- Since the counterclaim is an extension of the Respondent\u2019s defence against the claim, one has to consider whether counterclaims are included within the consent of the Parties to arbitrate before the Tribunal their dispute arising from the investment.\n\n- It would be hard to accept that the BIT\u2019s Contracting Parties intended to give rise to parallel proceedings before different courts and tribunals, by preventing the Host State from asserting its rights against the investor in a counterclaim.\n\n- It has also to be considered whether such exclusion would be a breach of natural justice.\n\n- In my opinion, in the present proceedings a free-standing counterclaim is admissible on the above grounds, due process includes the right to defend a claim and in my opinion natural justice requires that such defence may include making a counterclaim related to such issues. Furthermore the opposite solution would give rise to parallel proceedings which may provide conflicting results and this may not be the purpose of an international convention.\n\n(ii) concerning the lack of evidence of Claimant\u2019s Additional, Subordinate Claim under Article 2(5) of the BIT in my opinion it is not a matter of want of sufficient evidence, but of lack of evidence. I concur then with the dismissal of such claim, even if I base such decision on the above different ground.\n\nArticle 8 (3) of the BIT provides:  \n The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall at no time whatever during the procedures involving investment disputes, asse[r]t as a defence its immunity as well as the fact that the investor has received compensation under an insurance Contract covering the whole or part of the incurred damage or loss.  \n BIT, art. 8 (3) (English text) (C-4)"}], "Content": "Decision on Jurisdiction, Admissibility and Liability\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n|  |\n| --- |\n| FREQUENTLY USED ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS |\n| 2007 Arbitration Award | Award of 30 October 2007 in an arbitration pursuant to the Share Purchase Contract |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| AAAS | Authority for State Assets Administration |\n| APAPS | Authority for Privatization and Management of State Ownership |\n| AVAS | Authority for State Asset Recovery |\n| BIT | Agreement between the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of Romania on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investments |\n| C-1... | Claimants' exhibits |\n| C-PHB | Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief, 9 July 2014 |\n| C-Request | Request for Arbitration, 23 July 2012 |\n| C-RJ/CC | Claimants' Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Counterclaim, 14 May 2014 |\n| C-RL/OJ/A/CC | Claimants' Reply on Liability, Objections to Jurisdiction/Admissibility, and on the Counterclaim, 17 December 2013 |\n| C-RM | Claimants' Reply Memorial on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction and on the Admissibility of the Counterclaim, 31 July 2013 |\n| C-RPHB | Claimants' Reply to Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, of 23 July 2014 |\n| Company or Socomet | S.C.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to ICSID pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of Romania on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investments, which entered into force on 14 March 1995 (\"BIT\"),1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\"). The BIT was agreed in the Italian, Romanian and English languages with all three texts being equally authentic, and in case of any differences of interpretation, the English text was to be considered as the text of reference. The ICSID Convention was agreed in the English, French and Spanish languages. For ease of reference, given also the language of this arbitration, the English texts of the BIT and the ICSID Convention are cited below.\n\nAgreement between the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of Romania on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investments, entered into force 14 March 1995 and terminated on 14 March 2010, subject to the \u2018sunset provision' in Article 11(3) (C-4).\n\n**II. THE PARTIES**\n-------------------\n\n2.\n\nThe two Claimants are:\n\na) Mr. Marco Gavazzi, an Italian national, residing at Via Appiani 1, 22036 Erba (Como), Italy; and\n\nb) Mr. Stefano Gavazzi, an Italian national, residing at Via Madonna del Bosco 12, 23807 Merate (Lecco), Italy\n\nhereinafter, collectively \"the Claimants\" or \"Gavazzi.\"\n\nThe Claimants are represented in the present proceedings by Prof. Avv. Giorgio Sacerdoti and Dr. Avv. Anna De Luca,Via Privata Maria Teresa 4, 20123 Milan, Italy.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Romanian State, acting by the Authority for State Assets Administration, headquartered in Bucharest, Romania, 50 Cpt A. Serbanescu St. (hereinafter \"the Respondent\" or \"Romania\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Respondent is represented in the present proceedings by a consortium consisting of SCA Cobuz & Associates, SPRL Bostina & Associates and Manuela Sarbu Law Office, with an address at Str. General Berthelot 59, Bucharest, Romania.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 2 August 2012, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 23 July 2012, together with exhibits C-1 through C-45 (the \"Request\").\n\n6.\n\nOn 27 August 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nBy letter of 5 September 2012, the Claimants proposed a method of constituting the Tribunal pursuant to Rule 2(1)(a) of the Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the \"Arbitration Rules\"). By the same letter, the Claimants appointed Mr. V. V. Veeder QC, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator.\n\n8.\n\nOn 9 October 2012, the Respondent accepted the Claimants' proposed method of constituting the Tribunal. Pursuant to Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties thus agreed that the Tribunal consist of three arbitrators, with each party appointing an arbitrator, and the presiding arbitrator to be appointed by the coarbitrators in consultation with the Parties. The Parties' method entailed the selection, by the co-arbitrators, of three qualified candidates, which the Parties would rank in order of preference. The co-arbitrators would then appoint one of the three candidates as President of the Tribunal.\n\n9.\n\nBy the same letter dated 9 October 2012, the Respondent notified the Centre that it appointed Mr. Mauro Rubino-Sammartano, a national of Italy, as arbitrator.\n\n10.\n\nOn the same day, the Centre called the Parties' attention to Article 39 of the ICSID Convention which provides that the majority of the arbitrators shall be nationals of States other than the Contracting State party to the dispute (Romania) and the Contracting State whose national is a party to the dispute (Italy), unless each individual member of the Tribunal has been appointed by agreement of the Parties. In accordance with Article 39, the Centre invited the Claimants to indicate whether they agreed to the Respondent's appointment.\n\n11.\n\nOn 11 October 2012, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr. Veeder had accepted his appointment as arbitrator.\n\n12.\n\nOn 17 October 2012, the Claimants informed the Centre that they had no objections to the appointment by Romania of Mr. Rubino-Sammartano.\n\n13.\n\nOn 19 October 2012, ICSID informed the Parties that Mr. Rubino-Sammartano had accepted his appointment as arbitrator. On the same day, the Centre asked the coarbitrators to provide ICSID with a list of three candidates to serve as President, for transmission to the Parties.\n\n14.\n\nOn 26 October 2012, the Centre transmitted a message from the co-arbitrators to the Parties, requesting additional information on the qualifications of the potential candidates for President of the Tribunal. The Parties responded by letters of 29 October and 2 November 2012.\n\n15.\n\nOn 6 November 2012, the Centre transmitted a message to the Parties with three candidates proposed by the co-arbitrators and invited them to rank the candidates in order of preference.\n\n16.\n\nOn 20 November 2012, the Centre informed the Parties that the co-arbitrators intended to appoint Professor Hans van Houtte, a national of Belgium, as presiding arbitrator. By letters of 20 and 26 November 2012, the Parties confirmed that they had no objections to the appointment of Prof. van Houtte.\n\n17.\n\nOn 26 November 2012, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention and Rule 6(1) of the Arbitration Rules, notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. The Secretary-General also informed the Parties that Ms. Martina Polasek, Team Leader/Legal Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary to the Tribunal.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 19 February 2013 in Paris, France. The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. Among other things, Procedural Order No. 1 reflected the Parties' agreement that the proceeding would be conducted in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of 2006 and that the place of the proceeding would be Paris, France. It also set out a timetable for the filing of the Parties' written submissions, with two alternative calendars, in the event that the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the phase on jurisdiction from the merits. It was decided at the first session that the Claimants' Request was accepted as the Claimants' memorial on the merits, excluding quantum.\n\n19.\n\nOn 15 July 2013, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the Claimants filed their submission on quantum, accompanied by exhibits C-46 through C-58 and an expert report of Deloitte. On the same day, the Respondent filed its objections to jurisdiction, a counter-memorial on liability and a counterclaim, accompanied by exhibits R-1 through R-56.\n\n20.\n\nOn 31 July 2013, the Claimants filed a reply to the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and counterclaim.\n\n21.\n\nOn 23 August 2013, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, the Respondent filed its request for bifurcation. The request reiterated the preliminary objections that were raised in the Respondent's submission of 15 July 2013, and requested that the Tribunal order the suspension of the proceedings on the merits, pending the resolution of its preliminary objections.\n\n22.\n\nOn 9 September 2013, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties concerning the Respondent's request for bifurcation of the proceedings.\n\n23.\n\nOn 13 September 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 deciding to join the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction and the Claimants' objections to the counterclaim to issues of liability, and to bifurcate issues of quantum to a further stage of the proceeding. By the same order, the Tribunal adopted a new procedural calendar.\n\n24.\n\nOn 17 December 2013, the Claimants filed a reply on liability and a counter-memorial on jurisdiction and admissibility of the counterclaim, accompanied by exhibits C-59 through C-70, the witness statements of Mr. Marco Gavazzi, Mr. Stefano Gavazzi, Mr. Michele Mugnai, Mr. Florin Frumosu. Mr. Raimondo di Carpegna Varini, and Mr. Betto Stendardi and the expert opinion of Professor Sergiu Deleanu.\n\n25.\n\nOn 11 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the procedural calendar.\n\n26.\n\nOn 14 April 2014, the Respondent filed a rejoinder on liability and a reply on jurisdiction and the counterclaim, accompanied by exhibits R-57 through R-146.\n\n27.\n\nOn 14 May 2014, the Claimants filed a rejoinder on jurisdiction and the counterclaim, accompanied by exhibits C-71 through C-77 and the second expert opinion of Professor Sergiu Deleanu.\n\n28.\n\nOn 22 May 2014, the Respondent sought leave from the Tribunal to file new evidence in the form of a witness statement and an expert opinion. On 23 May 2014, the Claimants objected to the admissibility of the Respondent's proposed new evidence. By the same date, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to produce the new evidence and the Claimants to provide their comments on its admissibility. The Tribunal also notified the Parties that it would consider the material *de bene esse*, for the purposes of determining the admissibility of the Respondent's evidence.\n\n29.\n\nOn 27 May 2014, the Respondent filed a witness statement of Ms. Viorica Tataru and an expert opinion of Prof. Bazil Oglinda. By letter of 28 May 2014, the Claimants filed their objections to the admissibility of the Respondent's new evidence. By communication of 29 May 2014, the Respondent submitted its rebuttal to the Claimants' objections of 28 May 2014.\n\n30.\n\nOn 1 June 2014, the Tribunal deliberated on the admissibility of the new witness statement and expert report and, the following day, at the opening of the hearing, informed the Parties that it decided to admit this new evidence into the record, subject to the Claimants' right to make any consequential application.\n\n31.\n\nA hearing on jurisdiction and liability took place in Paris, France, on 2-5 June 2014. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Secretary of the Tribunal, present at the hearing were:\n\nFor the Claimants:\n\nProfessor Avv. Giorgio Sacerdoti Counsel for the Claimants\n\nDr. Avv. Anna De Luca Counsel for the Claimants\n\nMr. Adrian Iordache Eversheds Lina & Guia\n\nMs. Alexandra Kerjean Eversheds, Paris\n\nMr. Marco Gavazzi Claimant\n\nMr. Stefano Gavazzi Claimant\n\nFor the Respondent:\n\nMs. Alina Cobuz Cobuz & Associates Law Firm\n\nMs. Ramona Voinea Bostina & Associates Law Firm\n\nMs. Genoveva Luca Bostina & Associates Law Firm\n\nMs. Mara Asanache Bostina & Associates Law Firm\n\nMs. Diana Croitoru-Anghel Sarbu Manuela Law Office\n\nMr. Daniel Visoiu Cobuz & Associates Law Firm\n\nMs. Laura Voinea Head of the Legal Department within the Authority for State Assets Administration\n\n32.\n\nThe following persons were examined as oral witnesses:\n\nOn behalf of the Claimants:\n\nMr. Marco Gavazzi Claimant\n\nMr. Stefano Gavazzi Claimant\n\nMr. Michele Mugnai Consultant\n\nMr. Raimondo di Carpegna Varini Techint/Tenova\n\nMr. Betto Stendardi Techint/Tenova\n\nMr. Florin Frumosu Consultant\n\nOn behalf of the Respondent:\n\nMrs. Viorica Tataru Legal expert within the Legal\n\nDepartment of the Authority for State Assets Administration\n\nProfessor Bazil Oglinda Founder Partner at ONV Law Firm\n\nArbitrator for the Court of International Commerce Arbitration attached to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of\n\n33.\n\nAt the hearing, on 2 June 2014, the Tribunal learnt that there were new exhibits attached to Mrs. Tataru's witness statement. On the same date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 concerning the admissibility of the Respondent's new evidence. The Tribunal confirmed its decision to admit Mrs. Tataru's statement and Professor Oglinda's expert opinion into the record, but denied the Respondent's request to admit the new exhibits attached to the witness statement. The Parties agreed that the Claimants would cross-examine the new witness and expert, that Messrs. Gavazzi could be present during the examination of Mrs. Tataru, and that either of them could be called back for further testimony following her examination, to rebut any new evidence. The Claimants, ultimately, did not avail themselves of this opportunity.\n\n34.\n\nOn 5 June 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 with post-hearing directions.\n\n35.\n\nThe Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 9 July 2014, and simultaneous reply post-hearing briefs on 23 July 2014.\n\n36.\n\nThe Claimants filed their statement of costs on 31 August 2014 and the Respondent filed its statement of costs on 19 September 2014.\n\n**IV. FACTS AND CONTENTIONS**\n-----------------------------\n\n37.\n\nThe dispute before the Tribunal arose against the backdrop of the end of the Communist regime, when, in its transition toward a free-market economy during the early 1990s, Romania started to privatize large State-owned enterprises.\n\n38.\n\nThe Romanian Government had created the State Ownership Fund (\"SOF\"), a government entity with legal personality, to negotiate privatization agreements with investors.2 SOF was dissolved and replaced in 2000 by the Authority for Privatization and Management of State Ownership (\"APAPS\"), which took over the responsibilities, assets, and personnel of SOF.3 In 2004, through the merger of APAPS with another State institution, the Government of Romania established the Authority for State Assets Recovery (\"AVAS\").4 As of 22 December 2012, AVAS changed its name into Authority for State Assets Administration (\"AAAS\").5\n\n*See* C-7 (Law on the Privatization of the Trading Companies, publ. 16 Aug. 1991, arts. 23-38). *See also* *Noble* *Ventures, Inc. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11), Award, para. 5 (12 Oct. 2005).\n\n*See* C-11 (Emergency Ordinance on the Incorporation of the Authority for Privatization and State Participation Administration, No. 296/2000).\n\n*See* ANEIR-Foreign Trade Promotion Centre, http://www.aneir-cpce.ro (Business Environment/Evolution of the Privatization Process in Romania) & C-14.\n\nR-PHB, para. 306.\n\n39.\n\nAVAS, its predecessors, and its successor were all Romanian government agencies tasked, among other things, with managing the privatization of State-owned enterprises.6 The dispute follows from the privatization of S.C. Socomet S.A. (\"Socomet\" or \"the Company\"), a large steel company based in Northern Romania. Socomet's history dates back to 1796, when a metallurgical plant was established in Ferdinandsberg (now Otelu Rosu). Over the next two centuries, the enterprise underwent several changes of ownership and name. In 1948, the enterprise was nationalized by the Romanian Government and renamed \"Otelu Rosu\" (Red Steel). After the end of the Communist regime, the enterprise was transformed into a joint-stock company, named \"S.C. Socomet S.A.\" On 21 April 2000, Socomet was renamed \"Gavazzi Steel S.A.\"\n\n*See also Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/1), Award, para. 3 (7 Dec. 2011).\n\n40.\n\nAt the time of its privatization, Socomet, like many companies that had been owned and controlled by the State for many decades, also carried a very significant amount of debt to Romanian government entities and needed substantial investment.\n\n41.\n\nSOF wanted to privatize Socomet by selling its majority shareholding in the company, which amounted to 70 percent of its shares. On 22 September 1998, it issued the \"Tender Book Regarding the Offer for Sale of Shares Managed by the State Ownership Fund for the Trading Company Socomet S.A. Otelu Rosu by Direct Negotiation\" (\"Tender Book\"),7 to provide prospective investors with information about the financial and industrial conditions of Socomet.\n\nC-18.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimants, Messrs. Marco and Stefano Gavazzi (who are brothers), were interested in acquiring the offered 70 percent shareholding from SOF in Socomet and engaged in negotiations with SOF on the basis of the Tender Book.8\n\n*See* Autoritatea pentru Valorificarea Activelor Statului (Authority for the Capitalization of the State Assets) v. Marco Gavazzi and Stefano Gavazzi, Final Award No. 212 (Court of International Commercial Arbitration Attached to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Romania and Bucharest, Case No. 743/2002), at 7, paras. 4-5 (30 Oct. 2007) (hereinafter \"2007 Romanian Award\") (C-6).\n\n**A. The Share Purchase Contract**\n----------------------------------\n\n43.\n\nOn 19 April 1999, SOF, on the one hand, and the Claimants, on the other, signed a \"Contract for Selling-Buying Shares No. 145\" (\"Share Purchase Contract\" or \"Contract\").9 Under the Contract, the Claimants undertook to purchase, and SOF undertook to sell, 4,522,197 shares in Socomet, representing 70 percent of Socomet's registered capital, for the total price of USD 517,020. The Contract was made in the English and Romanian languages, with the latter text prevailing over the former. For convenience, given also the language of this arbitration, references below are made to the English text (the Tribunal is not aware of any material discrepancy between the English and Romanian texts). Under Article 14, the Contract was governed by Romanian law.\n\nC-19.\n\n44.\n\nIn Article 5.1 of the Contract, the Claimants undertook to pay the purchase price in two installments as follows:\n\n*(b)... Within 48 banking hours from the date of fulfilling all the obligations* *specified in Art. 10.1, the Buyer shall pay 297,184 USD to the Seller's account....*\n\n*(c) Within 48 banking hours from the date of fulfilling all the obligations foreseen in Art.10.1, the Buyer shall issue an Irrevocable Letter of Credit for the balance of price amounting to 219,836 USD, that will be valid for 90 days from the Signing Date, to the Seller's account....*10\n\nShare Purchase Contract, Art. 5.1 (b)-(c) (C-19) (emphasis omitted).\n\n45.\n\nThe Claimants also undertook, in Article 8.10.1 of the Contract, to make investments and capital contributions in Socomet in the following terms:\n\n*Article 8.10.1 BUYER'S COMMITMENT*\n\n*(a) Buyer commits himself to effect in the Company either by own sources and provided [i]n his name or by a third Party he attracted, within a period of maximum 5 (five) years starting with the Payment Date, investment/contribution to capital as provided by law, in a total value of 20,000,000 USD (out of which the environmental investments represent 480,000 USD), scheduled according to Annex No.6.*11\n\n*Id.* Art. 8.10.1(a) (C-19) (emphasis omitted). In an Addendum No. 2 to the Share Purchase Contract, the parties agreed that the five-year period within which the Claimants were to make the investments and/or contributions would start to run on 24 June 2000 (\"Addendum no. 2/07.07.2000 to Share Sale Purchase Contract No. 145/19.04.1999 - SC Gavazzi Steel SA Otelu Rosu,\" Art. 1 (C-20)).\n\n46.\n\nThis Article 8.10.1(a) was amended by the Addendum of 7 July 2000 as follows:\n\n*Purchaser undertakes to bring in the company out of his own sources, brought on its name, or by a third party brought by the purchaser, for a period of maximum 5 (five) years, commencing on 24.06.2000, investments/capital* *contributions, in the forms provided by law, in a total amount of 20,000,000* *US$... scheduled in compliance with Annex no. 6.*12\n\nC-20.\n\n47.\n\nAnnex No. 6, as modified by the Addendum, specified that USD 2,000,000 would have to be invested during the period 24 June 2000-23 June 2001 with the following \"Investment objectives\": \"Oxygen Factory,\" \"Cooling water station Constructions,\" \"Transformation post.\"13 It further specified that USD 4,000,000 would have to be invested during the period 24 June 2001-23 June 2002 with the following \"Investment objectives\": \"Stoves and accessories.\"14\n\n*Id.*\n\n*Id.*\n\n48.\n\nSOF, for its part, was to satisfy a number of conditions prior to the contractually specified payment date, which conditions were set out in Article 10 of the Contract in the following terms:\n\n*Article 10 CONDITIONS TO BE MET PRIOR TO PAYMENT DATE*\n\n*10.1 Whether [sic: If] within 40 days from the Signing Date, Seller does not complete and settle the matters showed below, and/or whether [sic: if] the Company shall be closed due to the lack of any of the authorizations specified in Annex No.1/1/, the Buyer can decide to terminate* de jure *the Contract, and by informing the Seller on this decision in 5 days from the expiring of 40 days period, when this Contract will become null and void.*\n\n*a. The Balance Sheet on 31.12.1998 is drawn up by the Company Management, and it is approved by the General Assembly of* *Shareholders, Auditing Committee and DGFPCS based on the inventory performed to the end of financial year 1998, in compliance with the Romanian laws.*\n\n*b. The Company debts to State Budget, Budget for Social Assurances, Health Budget, including credits got from the Ministry of Finances for paying the power and natural gas supply shall be rescheduled within 5 years, with a 2 years grace period, and all related penalties and additional payment for delay shall be cancelled.*\n\n*c. Seller shall exert all diligence required, and he shall support Buyer in solving the rescheduling of outstanding debts, and for cancelling the penalties and additional payments for delay owed by the Company to*\n\n*CONEL and ROMGAZ.*\n\n*10.2 Seller shall inform at once the Buyer on the fulfillment of each of the conditions specified in Art. 10.1.*\n\n*10.3 Whether one or more of the conditions mentioned above will not be met within the time provided in Art. 10.1., then Seller cannot require to the Buyer to make the payment of the purchase price, unless Buyer will make Disclaimer of Fulfilling Conditions.*\n\n*10.4 In case the Contract will be terminated under the conditions specified in Art. 10.1., Seller shall retur[n] at once to Buyer the bank guarantee.*15\n\nShare Purchase Contract, Art. 10 (C-19) (emphasis omitted)\n\n49.\n\nThus, under Article 10.1(b) of the Share Purchase Contract, the SOF was to bring about - \"complete and settle\"16 - the rescheduling of the Company's debts to a number of State entities and the cancellation of all related delayed payment penalties that had been imposed on the Company (\"Restructuring of the Company's Debt\"). Under Article 10 of the Contract, the SOF's failure to fulfill this condition, as well as any of the other conditions listed in Article 10.1 of the Contract, within forty days of the signing of the Contract, entitled the Claimants to terminate the Contract and relieved them of their obligation to pay the purchase price. If the Claimants elected to terminate the Contract, the Contract would \"become null and void.\"\n\nShare Purchase Contract, Art. 10.1 (C-19).\n\n50.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, under Article 10.1(b)-(c) of the Share Purchase Contract, SOF was obligated \"to carry out legal proceedings, as per the applicable framework,\" such that Socomet would \"obtain\" the Restructuring of the Company's Debt, and to assist the Claimants in their endeavors to obtain the restructuring of Socomet's debts to its energy and gas suppliers, CONEL S.A. and ROMGAZ S.A.17 In other words, according to the Respondent, SOF undertook merely to facilitate, and not to grant, the Restructuring of the Company's Debt - indeed, so the Respondent contends, under Romanian law SOF had no authority to grant any exemptions from payment of debts due to the State Budget.18\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, para. 192 (emphasis omitted).\n\n*Id.* paras. 194-200.\n\n51.\n\nSocomet was heavily indebted to the State and a multitude of State special funds and State-owned enterprises.19 The Claimants assert that the success of Socomet's privatization as well as of the Claimants' investment depended essentially on the Restructuring of the Company's Debt, which was fundamental for Socomet's revitalization and for the re-launch of its activities worldwide.20 For those reasons, the Claimants assert, the restructuring of the Company's debts, listed in Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract and specifically included in the Contract at the Claimants ' request, were of paramount importance to them.21\n\nC-Request, para. 28.\n\n*Id.* para. 19.\n\n*Id.* paras. 28-29.\n\n**B. SOF's Notice of 3 June 1999 to the Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n52.\n\nOn 3 June 1999, some 45 days after the signing of the Share Purchase Contract and five days after the date the Claimants could still terminate the Contract pursuant to its Article 10, SOF informed the Claimants by Notice No. 1/4026 that it had fulfilled the conditions imposed by Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract and, importantly, that the Romanian Prime Minister had approved the restructuring of the Company's debts to the State Budget, the Social Insurance Budget, the Health Budget and Special Funds, as well as the cancellation of all related penalties and late payment additions. Thus, SOF requested that the Claimants pay the contractually stipulated price for their 70 percent shareholding in Socomet. Specifically, the 3 June 1999 Notice stated:\n\n*In respect of the Stock Sale-Purchase Agreement no. 145/19.04.1999, we notify the following:*\n\n*1. By the letter no. P/2339/28.04.1999 (a copy enclosed hereto), the State Property Fund [SOF] requested and the Prime Minister of Romania approved the rescheduling of the debts of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu* *Rosu to the State Budget, Social Insurance Budget, Health Budget and Special Funds, as well as the annulment of all related penalties and late payment additions.*\n\n*2. By the letter no. P/2994/28.05.1999 (a copy enclosed hereto), the State Property Fund [SOF] took all the necessary measures, by requesting the Minister of Industry and Commerce the rescheduling of the past due debts of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu to CONEL and ROMGAZ, as well as the annulment of all related penalties and late payment additions.*\n\n*By these, the State Property Fund [SOF] has fulfilled the conditions resting with it according to art. 10.1 of the Agreement, and Messrs. Marco and Stefano Gavazzi shall subsequently pay the amount of USD 297,184 by banking swift and issue an irrevocable letter of credit for the price difference, amounting to USD 219,836, according to art. 5.1. letters (a) and (b) of the Agreement.*22\n\nSOF Notice No. 1/4026 dated 3 June 1999 (C-21) (translated from Romanian into English).\n\n53.\n\nTwo documents were enclosed with the 3 June 1999 Notice, namely: (i) Note No. 5/3228 dated 17 May 1999, signed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of SOF, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Labor and Social Protection, and the Minister of Health and approved by the then Prime Minister of Romania, Mr. Radu Vasile (\"Government's Note No. 5/3228\");23 and (ii) Note No. P/2994 dated 28 May 1999, addressed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors of SOF to the then Romanian Minister of Industry and Commerce, Mr. Radu Berceanu (\"SOF's Note No. P/2994\").24 These two Notes are described in the following paragraphs.\n\nC-22.\n\nC-23.\n\n*a)*  *The Government\u2019s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, which was entitled \"Note on the proposals to reschedule the debts and exempt from the payment of penalties and delay penalties of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu,\" stated in relevant part:\n\n\u2026\n\n*The STATE OWNERSHIP FUND signed Sale-Purchase Agreement no. 145/19.04.1999, for the stock of 70% of the shares of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu, together with Mr. MARCO and Mr. STEFANO GAVAZZI, Italian individuals, the latter being the only ones to submit a bid.*\n\n*Considering the difficult economic and financial situation of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu, the Purchasers are requesting, based on Government Ordinance no. 11/1996 on the enforcement of budget debts and Government Decision no. 55/1998 on privatizing companies, to benefit from the facilities that may be granted with regard to rescheduling overdue and unpaid debts, as well as exemption from the payment of related penalties and delay penalties.*\n\n*The request of MARCO and STEFANO GAVAZZI refers to rescheduling the debts of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu that are overdue and unpaid on time to the State Budget, the Social Insurance Budget, the Health Budget and Special Funds, over a period of 5 years, with a grace period of 2 years. Subsequently, the payments shall be done as follows: 10% in the third year, 30% in the fourth year and 60% in the last year, as well as the cancellation of all related penalties and/or delay penalties.*\n\n*The following is mentioned:*\n\n*- MARCO and STEFANO GAVAZZI are the sole investors to submit a bid for S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu. If the proposals for rescheduling the debts and exempt from the payment of penalties and delay penalties of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu are approved, these investors also intend to purchase the stock of shares held by the State Ownership Fund in S.C. LAMDRO S.A. Turnu Severin;*\n\n*- the requests are conditions for the payment of the price in the sale-purchase agreement for the stock of shares managed by the State Ownership Fund in S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu, but these requests exceed the competence of the State Ownership Fund;*\n\n*- the bidder undertakes to perform important investments in the company, including those for environmental protection, in amount of USD 20 million, investments that the latter will perform over a period of 5 years, for the purpose of economically and financially readjusting and re-launching the production activity.*\n\n*We also mention that the sale-purchase agreement has a clause that provides that if within 40 days as of the signing date the Seller does not finalize or settle the rescheduling of debts and cancellation of related penalties, the Purchaser may decide to terminate the Agreement* de jure *, informing the Seller of this decision within 5 days from the expiry of the 40-day period, and the Agreement shall become null and void.*\n\n*If the Shares Sale-Purchase Agreement is unilaterally terminated by the Purchaser (by waiver), by the State Ownership Fund (due to the Purchaser's failure to pay the financial obligations stipulated in the agreement clauses, in the amount and within the provided deadlines) or for any other reason, including force majeure, the payment benefits provided in this NOTE lose their validity.*\n\n*The exact amount of the debts, penalties and delay penalties, as well as their distribution shall be verified by DGFPCFS Caras Severin.*\n\n*Considering the above, please approve the facilities regarding the payment of the said obligations of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu.*25\n\nC-22 (translated from Romanian into English).\n\n55.\n\nIn the top right-hand part of the document, the Government's Note No. 5/3228 bears the printed notation \" Approved - Prime Minister Radu Vasile,\" as well as the Prime Minister's official stamp and his signature over the printed notation.26 As will be discussed in detail further in this Decision, the Claimants and the Respondent disagree on the nature and effect of Government Note No. 5/3228. For the Claimants, by this Note, the Romanian Government expressly approved the rescheduling and waivers provided by the Share Purchase Contract as a condition for the project. For the Respondent, the Note was merely an internal communication from the Prime Minister to various addressees requesting the approval of the proposed rescheduling, subject to the observance of applicable legal provisions.\n\nC-22 (translated from Romanian into English; stamp and signature on Romanian original).\n\n*b)*  *SOF\u2019s Note No. P/2994 of 28 May 1999 to the Romanian Minister of Industry and Commerce*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n56.\n\nSOF's Note No. P/2994 of 28 May 1999 to the Romanian Minister of Industry and Commerce tracks, by and large, the language of the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999. It also explicitly confirms that \" *the approval of the Prime Minister of Romania on the rescheduling of the debts of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu ha[d] been obtained, as well as the annulment of all related penalties and late payment additions to the State Budget, Social Security Budget, Health Budget and Special Funds*.\"27 The Note goes on to request that the Minister of Industry and Commerce approve the restructuring of Socomet's debts to the National Electricity Company CONEL S.A. and the National Company ROMGAZ S.A. for the purchase of electricity, gas and petrol.28 In an appendix to the Note, SOF proposed that Socomet's debts to those two State-controlled entities be restructured as follows: (i) with respect to CONEL S.A., rescheduling over five years the debts existing on 28 February 1999, with a grace period of two years, and cancellation of the related penalties and delayed payment additions existing on 28 February 1999; and (ii) with respect to ROMGAZ S.A., rescheduling over 12 months the debts existing on 28 February 1999, with a grace period of six months, and cancellation of the related penalties and delayed payment additions existing on 28 February 1999.\n\nC-23 (emphasis added, translated into English from Romanian).\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the Minister of Industry and Commerce controlled and managed those two State-controlled entities. *See* C-Request, para. 41.\n\n**C. Events Following SOF's Notice of 3 June 1999 to the Claimants and the Freezing of Socomet's Bank Accounts in September 1999**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nAfter receiving the Notice of 3 June 1999 from SOF,29 the Claimants paid the second and final installment of the purchase price of their 70 percent shareholding in Socomet in accordance with Article 5.1 of the Share Purchase Contract30 and the Claimants became members of the Board of Socomet.31 Further, so the Claimants allege, to relaunch production and sales abroad, they created S.C. Gavazzi Steel Consultants (\"Gavazzi Steel Consultants\"), a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands but wholly owned and controlled by Socomet, to be Socomet's general agent abroad in charge of developing its international business and collecting purchase orders from foreign clients.32\n\n*See supra* para. 51.\n\n*See supra* para. 43. *See also* the 2007 Romanian Award, at 8, para. 6 (C-6) (\"[T]trusting [the] statement [in the Notice of 3 June 1999 from the SOF 3 that the SOF \"had fulfilled all the conditions that were incumbent upon it pursuant to Article 10.1 (b) of the Contract\"], [Gavazzi] paid USD 219,836 (the second instalment)\").\n\nOn 9 September 1999, the Claimants were formally registered as members of the Board of Directors of Socomet with the Romanian Chamber of Commerce, after having been appointed as such at the general meeting of Socomet's shareholders held on 9 July 1999 (*See* Minutes of the general meeting of the shareholders of Socomet, 9 July 1999 (C-25); C-Request, para. 50).\n\nC-Request, para. 48.\n\n58.\n\nHowever, so the Claimants assert, the Restructuring of the Company's Debt was not carried out as required by Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract, either within the contractually specified deadline or any time thereafter.\n\n59.\n\nBy letters of 10 June and 2 September 1999, Socomet requested that the Romanian Ministry of Finance carry out the Restructuring of the Company's Debt, pointing to the Company's unavailability of funds.33\n\n*See* first paragraph of the letter from the Romanian Ministry of Finance to Socomet dated 19 October 1999 (C-24).\n\n**D. The Romanian Ministry of Finance's Letter to Socomet Dated 19 October 1999**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n60.\n\nBy letter of 19 October 1999, the Romanian Ministry of Finance replied to Socomet's letters of 10 June and 2 September 1999 (\"19 October 1999 Letter\").34 The Claimants contend that the 19 October 1999 Letter, while formally affirming the rescheduling and waiver of the Company's debts approved by the Romanian Prime Minister in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, in fact established new terms for the restructuring of Socomet's debt that were less favorable to the Company than those established in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 (and undertaken by SOF in Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract).\n\nC-24; R-18. The 19 October 1999 Letter states in relevant part (translated from Romanian into English):   \n*Referring to your letters no. 20252/10.06.1999 and no. 20977/02.09.1999, registered with the Ministry of Finance under no. 442,311/17.06.1999 and the Otelu Rosu Financial circumscription under no. 8/07.09.1999, whereby you requested to be granted benefits for the payment of obligations to the state budget given the temporary unavailability of funds,... we hereby inform you that, in accordance with Common Note no. 5/3228/RV/17.05.1999, of the State Assets Fund, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, the Ministry of Health[,] the Ministry of Finance and approved by the prime minister Radu Vasile, the following were approved:*  \n*- the exemption from payment of delay penalties related to the overdue state obligations in total amount of lei 67,288,123,853, representing delay penalties related to the tax on profit in amount of lei 9,148,169,519, delay penalties related to tax on salaries in amount of lei 22,256,879,517, VAT related delay penalties in amount of lei 26,370,526,132, delay penalties related to the research and development fund in amount of lei 743,704,685 and delay penalties related to overdue loans granted from the state budget based on the provisions of Government Decision no. 528/1998, in amount of lei 8,768,808,000;*  \n*- rescheduling the payment of the total amount of lei 56,099,839,056, representing tax on profit in amount of lei 4,408,095,093, due tax on salaries in amount of lei 14,694,870,037, VAT in amount of lei 3,814,601,110, research and development fund in amount of lei 743,704,685, overdue amounts from loans granted from the state budget in accordance with the provisions of Government Decision no. 528/1998 and penalties calculated for delayed payment of tax on salaries in amount of lei 3,438,568,131, in 54 increasing monthly installments starting with 31.03.2000, according to the annex hereto.*  \n*Granting the payment rescheduling is conditioned upon:*  \n*- payment of current obligations to the state budget, no later than 30 days after the due date.* *For failure to pay on the due date, delay penalties are owed according to legal provisions.*\n\n61.\n\nThe 19 October 1999 Letter, according to the Claimants, introduced a new rescheduling scheme. In essence, in deviation from the terms of the Share Purchase Contract and the Government's Note No. 5/3228, it shortened the original two-year grace period for the repayment of Socomet's debt to some 5.5 months, *i.e.*, from August 2001 to 31 March 2000. Moreover, a substantial part of the penalties were not cancelled but only rescheduled with a high annual interest rate of 36 %.35 Further, the rescheduling of the debts was subordinated to the payment of Socomet's current obligations to the State Budget and subjected to additional conditions - such as a bank guarantee to be provided to the local tax office - that were not mentioned in the Share Purchase Contract or the Government's Note No. 5/3228.36 Finally, the Claimants allege that the debts covered by the 19 October 1999 Letter from the Ministry of Finance concerned only a portion of Socomet's taxes and similar debts towards the Ministry of Finance.37 The Claimants also allege that the debts towards the other Ministries were not covered by the Order from the Minister of Finance.\n\nC-PHB, para 49.\n\nR-18, at 2.\n\nC-PHB, para 50.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent argues that, while the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 199938 only established the general terms of a proposal, the Letter of 19 October 1999 from the Ministry of Finance established the terms for the rescheduling in specific terms, taking into account the Company's temporary illiquidity. Moreover, so the Respondent argues, the Claimants were aware of the procedure for the rescheduling of tax debts.39 The Respondent states that, because the current debts to the State Budget and the rescheduling installment for January 2001 were not paid, the rescheduling could not be carried out.40\n\nC-22.\n\nR-RPHB, paras. 71-76.\n\nR-PHB, para. 133; C-36 (\"Minutes of the Board of Directors,\" Gavazzi Steel, 4 May 2000, at 2).\n\n63.\n\nFor the Claimants, however, the Respondent's case lacks any foundation and is not evidenced by contemporaneous evidence.41 Moreover, so the Claimants submit, AVAS Memorandum of 2 May 2001 to State Secretary Zelenco indicates that Socomet was compliant with its rescheduling commitments and would be granted a rescheduling.42\n\nThe Claimants argue that the only evidence submitted by the Respondent is a defective and incomplete *a posteriori* internal report from AVAS of November 2002 (R-50).\n\n*See* C-33.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that SOF fully complied with its obligations under the Share Purchase Contract relating to the rescheduling of Socomet's debts, \"in the sense that the budget debts, as well as the debts towards the energy and gas suppliers were in fact rescheduled, and the related penalties were cancelled, as a consequence of the approval of [the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999], in accordance with the relevant legal provisions in force.\"43 According to the Respondent, the 19 October 1999 Letter establishes that the Company's debts to the State Budget were rescheduled in accordance with the relevant Romanian laws; it does not represent a \"second Release,\" as erroneously contended by the Claimants.44 In this connection, the Respondent produced a letter dated 19 May 2000 from the Ministry of Finance to SOF, stating that, through its Letter of 19 October 1999, the Ministry of Finance had granted the Company \"the fiscal facilities provided by the legislation in force,\" and that, in accordance with that legislation, \"the scheduling of payment may start with a period of grace of maximum 6 months and not of 2 years, as requested.\"45\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, para. 208 (emphasis omitted) (referencing C-22).\n\n*Id.* paras. 211-212.\n\nLetter dated 19 May 2000 from the Romanian Ministry of Finance to SOF (R-19). This letter provides in relevant part:  \n*Referring to your notice no. 1/3746/05.04.2000 by which you request fiscal facilities for SC \"Gavazzi Steel\" SA Otelu[] Rosu, as approved by Note 5/3228/17.05.1999, respectively the scheduling for payment on a period of 5 years with a period of grace and the annulment of the surcharges related to the outstanding debts to the State budget, we inform you that, by notice of Ministry of Finance no. 443,604/443.685/442,311/442.215/19.10.1999..., SC \"Gavazzi Steel\" SA Otelu[] Rosu has obtained the fiscal facilities provided by the legislation in force, respectively art. 82-85 of the Government Ordinance no. 11/1996 regarding the execution of the budgetary debts, as subsequently amended, and the Order of the Minister of Finance no. 1283/1998.*  \n*According to the above mentioned normative acts, the scheduling of payment may start with a period of grace of maximum 6 months and not of 2 years, as requested.*  \n*In the same time, we inform you that, according to the provisions of the circular letter no. 5775/03.04.2000, signed by the Minister of Finance, Decebal Traian Remes, the work on the files referring to the granting of facilities for the payment of budgetary obligations has been suspended, until new dispositions.*\n\n65.\n\nFurther, the Respondent points out, the Claimants never availed themselves of the remedies provided under Romanian law to challenge the 19 October 1999 Letter; indeed, they accepted its terms, as evidenced by the Company's letter of 3 December 1999 to the Otelu Rosu Tax Authority, which was co-signed by Mr. Stefano Gavazzi.46\n\nR-PHB, para. 348.\n\n66.\n\nThe Claimants concede that, in the belief that the Romanian Government would soon be able to restructure Socomet's debts as agreed, they continued the operations through Gavazzi Steel Consultants, which started to sign contracts on behalf of Socomet and to pay salaries to its foreign managers and suppliers. The Claimants also injected additional funds into Socomet either directly, using their own personal funds, or through Gavazzi Steel Consultants.47 All these actions, the Claimants contend, allowed Socomet to survive and remain active for some time.\n\nC-Request, para. 61. *See also* 2007 Romanian Award, at 20-21, para. 1 (C-6).\n\n**E. The Substantiation Note of May 2001 and the Government's Decision No.692 of 19 July 2001**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n67.\n\nIn May or July 2001, APAPS (SOF's successor) and the Ministry of Finance in a \"Substantiation Note\" requested the Ministry of Justice to approve for certain privatized companies - among which Socomet (which, since 21 April 2000 had changed its name to \"Gavazzi Steel S.A.\"48) - the rescheduling of debts towards the State Budget and the cancellation of related penalties.49 The Respondent and the Claimants draw contradictory conclusions from this \"Substantiation Note.\" From the statement in the \"Substantiation Note\" that \" *the privatized companies. are at this time fully or*  *partially* *paying current obligations to all state budgets and special funds\"*50 - the Respondent concludes that Socomet had outstanding debts. However, the Claimants conclude that Socomet had no outstanding debts from the statement in the \"Substantiation Note\" that the *\"purchasers of the stocks of shares of the companies that are the object of this Note* [including Socomet] *have fulfilled the obligations undertaken through the shares sale-purchase agreements signed with the [SOF/APAPS], due until this time.* \"51 The Note went on to propose conditions for the Restructuring of the Company's Debt that were less favorable than the ones established for Socomet in Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract and confirmed by the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999. In particular, it allowed for a grace period of six months while the grace period initially envisaged had been two years. The Respondent argues that the Substantiation Note, by its statement is submitted for approval,\" shows clearly that it did not establish any obligation but had to be approved by a further Government Decision.52\n\nBy addendum of dated 21 April 2000 to the Share Purchase Contract, Socomet changed its name to Gavazzi Steel S.A. C-Request, para. 48 & 2007 Romanian Award, at 7, para. 5 (C-6).\n\nC-32. The exact month in which the Substantiation Note was issued is not clear. The Claimants assert that it was transmitted to the Secretary of State, Ministry of Finance, in May 2001 and included in the Draft Government Decision of 19 July 2001 (*see infra* para. 68).

The Restructuring of the Company's Debt remained subject to conditions that were less favorable than those established in Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract and confirmed in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999. The original grace period became six months as of 1 August 2001. The Government Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001 further modified the original conditions to the Claimants' detriment: for example, it reduced the universe of debts to be rescheduled; and it unfavorably changed the rescheduling plan originally established in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.54\n\nGovernment of Romania, Decision No. 692, 19 July 2001, published in the Official Gazette of Romania (*Monitorul Oficial al Rom\u00e2niei*), Part I, No. 425/31.VII.2001 (C-34).\n\nC-Request, para. 68.\n\n69.\n\nThe Romanian authorities, so the Claimants assert, did not even carry out the amended rescheduling scheme announced in the Romanian Government's Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001.\n\n**F. Events Leading Up to the Company's Insolvency**\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n70.\n\nThe Claimants assert that, on 15 September 1999, Romanian banks, pursuant to a directive by the Minister of Finance, froze all accounts of Socomet to recover the Company's debts to the State Budget, and then paid these debts, thereby depleting Socomet's accounts.55 The Claimants contend that Socomet's funds deposited in Romanian banks were in this manner transferred to the Romanian State to pay the very same debts that Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract had provided to be rescheduled or canceled and which the Respondent had indeed committed to be rescheduled or waived by the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.\n\nC-Request, para. 56. *See also* the 2007 Romanian Award, at 8, para. 6 (C-6) (\"[T]he condition precedent under Article 10.1 (b) [of the Share Purchase Contract] was never properly met, and this led, in particular, to the freezing of Socomet's bank accounts in September 1999.\").\n\n71.\n\nAll Parties agree that the Company's bank accounts remained frozen at the request of the Ministry of Finance till 6 December 1999, when the Otelu Rosu Tax Authority *(Circumscriptia Fiscala Otelu Ro* *\u015f* *u)* ordered the suspension of five enforcement orders against the Company partially because some fiscal debts had been paid and partially because others had been rescheduled by the Romanian Ministry of Finance on 19 October 1999.56 As of 6 December 1999, the Respondent asserts, the Company was again able to conduct banking operations in relation to its then current activities.57 However, the Claimants contend, the Ministries continued to claim the payment of old debts and to block Socomet's accounts.58 For instance, in April 2000, Socomet's accounts were blocked by the Labour Department (Caras Severin Labor) which requested immediate payment of the outstanding and current debts and which prevented Socomet from paying its workers and suppliers.59 Because debts were not rescheduled, Socomet had to use its funds to pay such debts and could not redress its activities.60 This, so the Claimants argue, is in great contrast to the original rescheduling and waiver scheme whereby Socomet would have been released from all interest and penalties and would only have had to pay 10% of its past debts in August 2002 after having benefited from a grace period until August 2001.61\n\nLetter No. 3319 dated 6 December 1999 from the Circumscripta Fiscala Otelu Rosu to Banca Comerciala Romana S.A., Otelu Rosu Agency (R-21, translated from Romanian into English):  \n*Please be hereby informed that the enforcement orders issued against SC \"GAVAZZI STEEL\"* *SA Otelu Rosu are suspended, as follows:*  \n*1.

Thus, they established a business plan for the recovery and development of the Company involving an investment in the Company of USD 20,000,000 within five years from the payment of the share purchase price in accordance with their undertaking in Article 8.10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract.\n\n73.\n\nOn 12 July 2002, Mr. Marco Gavazzi informed AV AS of the negotiations the Claimants were conducting with potential partners to strengthen the financial basis of the Company and to implement the business plan.62 Techint S.p.A., an Italian steel company, and Simest S.p.A., a financial company owned by the Italian Government to support Italian investors abroad, were among those potential partners, so the Claimants contend. The business plan provided, among other things, for a financing of USD 27,000,000 by the Austrian Bank Hypo VereinsBank, to acquire new \u2018Consteel' production technology, developed by Techint S.p.A. In his letter, Mr. Marco Gavazzi noted that, because all the Company's bank accounts had been frozen, the Claimants could not send new funds from abroad to pay the Company's current debts to the State Budget, which payment was, in turn, a condition set by the Government for the Restructuring of the Company's Debt. Mr. Marco Gavazzi further pointed out that local Romanian banks had refused credit lines to the Company to pay its debts because its balance sheet carried the \"enormous weight of the old preprivatization debts.\"63 The Claimants assert that a pledge from the Romanian Commercial Bank was necessary to implement the investment plan established by the Claimants, Techint S.p.A., and Simest S.p.A. and financed by Hypo VereinsBank. The Romanian Commercial Bank, however, refused to intervene because of the existing freeze of the Company's bank accounts by the Romanian Government, even if its intervention would not require direct funding.64 Mr. Marco Gavazzi concluded, in his 12 July 2002 letter, that the only way to \"make a very strong injection of new cash\" in the Company was to bring in a new partner; to this end, his brother Stefano would sell his 39 percent stake in the Company to Acciaierie Venete S.p.A., an Italian steel company, which would then provide a cash infusion of USD 5,000,000. AVAS never replied to Mr. Marco Gavazzi's 12 July 2002 letter.\n\nLetter 12 July 2002 Marco Gavazzi/APAPS (C-35).\n\n*Id.*\n\nC-Request, para. 75. The 2007 Romanian Award, at 22, paras. 7-8 (C-6) describes these events as follows:  \n*... From a financial standpoint, the transaction provided that HypoVereinsbank \u2014 which had already expressed its agreement \u2014 would raise the funds required for the investment. To permit SACE\u2019s (the Italian State export credit-insurance company) necessary guarantee of the investment, the Romanian Commercial Bank was asked to intervene \u2014 risk free \u2014 in order to transfer the loan directly to Gavazzi Steel, and to cross-guarantee the initial loan made by HypoVereinsbank.*  \n*... The Arbitral Tribunal finds that [Gavazzi] supplied sufficient documentary and written evidence that the non-completion of said financial transaction, having reached an* *advanced phase, was due to Romanian Commercial Bank\u2019s refusal to participate, as a consequence of Gavazzi Steel\u2019s inability to accede to current account, following its often* *quoted freezing by the Romanian Ministries.*\n\n74.\n\nThus, so the Claimants contend, the Romanian Government's failure to carry out the Restructuring of the Company's Debt in breach of its commitments of 17 May 1999, together with the continued freezing of the Company's bank accounts, frustrated the implementation of the business plan. The Respondent objects that the Claimants themselves were responsible for the blocking of the bank accounts by not paying what was due to the Respondent. The Claimants, however, reply that the freezing of the accounts was due to the Romanian authorities not having implemented their multiple commitments as regards waiver and rescheduling.65\n\nC-PHB, para. 71.\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that the Tribunal should not take into account the Claimants' investment plans, which do not rely upon any signed contemporaneous document.66\n\nR-RPHB, para. 57.\n\n76.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Socomet became practically insolvent; and that, at this point, the Claimants could not but abandon their endeavours to revitalize the Company and, thus, their investment project.67 At the general meeting of the shareholders of the Company held on 24 August 2002, the Board of Directors recognized the extreme seriousness of the situation, with the Company being \"virtually insolvent.\" The Board concluded that the only viable way to allow the Company to continue with its activities was a \"judiciary reorganization pursuant to Law no. 64.\" The Company's Director General was charged with setting this procedure in motion.68 Meanwhile, the Company's creditors had already filed an application to initiate such procedure before the Tribunal of Recita.\n\nC-Request, paras. 76-77.\n\n\"Minutes of the Board of Directors,\" 24 Aug. 2002 (C-36).\n\n**G. The Arbitration Proceedings Initiated by APAPS Against Messrs. Gavazzi in October 2002**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n77.\n\nOn 31 October 2002, APAPS (as claimant) started an arbitration against Messrs. Marco and Stefano Gavazzi (as respondents) at the Court of International Commercial Arbitration attached to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Romania and Bucharest, pursuant to the dispute resolution clause contained in Article 13 of the Share Purchase Contract (the \"2002 Romanian arbitration\"). In its request for arbitration, APAPS alleged multiple breaches by Messrs. Gavazzi of the Share Purchase Contract and requested that the arbitral tribunal, among other things, should terminate the Contract, order that Messrs. Gavazzi return the purchased shares, pay an amount allegedly due for unpaid dividends and pay damages for the mismanagement of the Company totaling USD 14,000,000. Messrs. Gavazzi, for their part, denied any liability to APAPS and also pleaded, as a counterclaim, multiple breaches by APAPS of the Share Purchase Contract. They requested, among other relief, that the arbitral tribunal terminate the Contract and order APAPS to return the share purchase price and to pay damages for its breach.69 In 2004, during the course of the Romanian arbitral proceedings, APAPS was succeeded by AVAS; accordingly, for the sake of convenience, in the following paragraphs the Tribunal will refer to AVAS as the claimant and the respondent to the counterclaim in the Romanian arbitral proceedings.\n\n2007 Romanian Award, at 9 (C-6).\n\n78.\n\nThe arbitral tribunal, chaired by the late Professor Pierre Lalive, a national of Switzerland, issued its award on 30 October 2007 (the \"2007 Romanian Award\"), in which it dismissed AVAS' claim and granted Messrs. Gavazzi's counterclaim in its entirety.70 Thus, it terminated the Share Purchase Contract and, among other matters, ordered AVAS to return the share purchase price to Messrs. Gavazzi and also to pay Messrs. Gavazzi a total of \u20ac 1,016,386 and USD 13,789,700 in damages. In reaching these decisions, the tribunal found, *inter alia*, that Messrs. Gavazzi had been induced by SOF's Notice of 3 June 1999,71 to pay the share purchase price and that Messrs. Gavazzi could have terminated the Share Purchase Contract pursuant to Article 10.1(b) of the Contract, but had not done so.\n\n2007 Romanian Award (C-6).\n\n*Id.* at 17, para. 3; *see also id.* at, 20, para. 1 (\"[O]nly [Gavazzi's] reliance on AVAS' debts rescheduling obligation (promised, assured but not fulfilled) induced [Gavazzi] to pay the share purchase price....\"). Concerning the SOF's Notice No. 1/4026 dated 3 June 1999 (C-21) see *supra* para. 51.\n\n**H. AVAS' successful challenge of the 2007 Romanian Award**\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n79.\n\nAVAS subsequently challenged the 2007 Romanian Award before the Bucharest Court of Appeals, which annulled the award by its decision of 22 April 2009, on the ground that the 2007 Romanian Award \"breached the principle of equal treatment, the principle of observance of the right to defense and the principle of contradiction, which are public order principles\".72 The Court of Appeals, in a subsequent proceeding, examined the merits of AVAS' claim and Messrs. Gavazzi's counterclaim that had been decided by the 2007 Romanian Award. By its decision of 16 March 2011,73 the Court of Appeals, *inter alia*, terminated the Share Purchase Contract, determined that AVAS should retain the monies paid by Messrs. Gavazzi under the Share Purchase Contract and rejected as unfounded both the remainder of AVAS' claims and Messrs. Gavazzi's entire counterclaim. Messrs. Gavazzi unsuccessfully challenged both decisions of the Court of Appeals before the Romanian High Court of Cassation and Justice, which by decision of 23 February 2012 affirmed the decisions of the Court of Appeals.74\n\nBucharest Court of Appeals, Commercial Section A VI-A *(Curtea de Apel Bucuresti, Sectia A VI-A* *Comerciala*), Commercial Decision No. 65 (Case No. 8799/2/2007), at 11 (22 Apr. 2009) (C-38).\n\nBucharest Court of Appeals, Commercial Section A VI-A *(Curtea de Apel Bucuresti, Sectia A VI-A* *Comerciala*), Commercial Decision No. 40 (Case No. 8799/2/2007) (16 Mar. 2011) (C-39).\n\nRomania High Court of Cassation and Justice, Civil Section A-II-A *(Rom\u00e2nia Inalta Curte de Casatie s\u00ee* *Justifie Sectia A-II-A Civila),* Decision No. 899 (Case No. 5898/1/2011) (23 Feb. 2012) (C-40).\n\n**V. THE PARTIES' CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**A. The Claimants' Claims**\n----------------------------\n\n80.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent has breached its obligations under the BIT by the following acts and omissions: the Romanian Government was aware that the Claimants' purchase of Socomet shares and their planned additional investments in Socomet depended on the rescheduling and waiver of Socomet's debts towards different administrations and that the whole project undertaken by the Claimants depended upon a rescheduling over five years, with a two-year grace period and a cancellation of all related penalties, as provided by Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract. The Government Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, signed by the Chairman of the Board of Direction of the State Ownership Fund, the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Labour and Social Protection as well as by the Minister of Health and formally approved by the Prime Minister, requested the administration to approve the rescheduling of debts and cancellation of penalties, exactly as these were spelled out by the Claimants and the State Ownership Fund in the Share Purchase Agreement.\n\n81.\n\nHowever, so the Claimants allege, the rescheduling and cancellation which the governmental authorities later envisaged, was substantially more restricted. By the 19 October 1999 Letter, the Minister of Finance only granted a grace period of 5.5 months and did not cancel a substantial part of the penalties. Moreover, the Letter conditioned the rescheduling on the constitution of a bank guarantee and the payment of Socomet's current obligations to the State budget. No evidence has been submitted of rescheduling schemes from the other Ministers.\n\n82.\n\nIn fact, because Socomet was unable to pay its current obligations towards the State Budget and its account had been frozen, Socomet never benefited from the substantially more limited rescheduling granted by the 19 October 1999 Letter. Likewise, the Government Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001, signed by the Prime Minister and countersigned by the Minister of Privatizations, the Minister of Labour and Social Solidarity and the Minister of Public Finances, which was also substantially less favorable than the initial Government Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, so the Claimants allege, was never carried out. Moreover, the Claimants contend that, in spite of the commitment to grant a grace-period of two years - later incorrectly reduced to 6 months - in fact no grace period at all had been granted and Socomet's bank accounts were frozen pursuant to a directive of the Minister of Finance to recover the Company's debts to the State Budget - the same debts which had to benefit from the grace-period and rescheduling. Moreover, the Claimants' 2002 investment plan failed because the Romanian banks refused to grant credit lines to Socomet because its old debts weighted heavily on its balance sheet. In August 2002, the Claimants had no other solution but to file for Socomet's bankruptcy. In arbitration proceedings for alleged breaches of the Share Purchase Contract, which APAPS started against the Claimants in Bucharest, the tribunal granted to the Claimants the return of the share purchase price and \u20ac 1,016,386 and USD 13,789,700 in damages because the confirmation that the rescheduling, as agreed in the Contract, would be carried out, had induced the Claimants to pay the share price. However, this award was abusively annulled on grounds, which, so the Claimants submit, were incorrect.\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimants request this Arbitral Tribunal to declare that the Respondent has breached the BIT, namely Article 2 (\"Fair and Equitable Treatment\"), Article 4(1) (\"Nationalization and Expropriation\") and Article 10 (\"Respect of Specific Contracts\") by the acts and omissions of its authorities. The Claimants request the Arbitral Tribunal additionally to declare that the Respondent, through the manner in which the Respondent's judicial authorities carried out their judicial functions with regard to the 2007 Romanian Award, has breached Article 2(5).75\n\nThe Claimants also assert that the actions of judicial authorities with respect to the 2007 Romanian Award breached Article 10(1) (\"Application of General International Law\") of the BIT. C-Request, fn 104.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimants further request the Arbitral Tribunal to order the Respondent to compensate the Claimants for breaches of the BIT in an amount provisionally assessed to be at least USD 37,806,720 and \u20ac 1,016,386, plus interest at the commercial rate the Arbitral Tribunal considers appropriate and just - and to order any other relief as the Arbitral Tribunal considers appropriate.\n\n85.\n\nThe Claimants request the Arbitral Tribunal to order the Respondent to pay all the costs and expenses of this arbitration, the Claimants' legal fees and expert fees, the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal and ICSID's other costs.\n\n**B. The Respondent's Response and Counterclaim**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Respondent raises a number of preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of the claims, which will be discussed hereafter.\n\n87.\n\nOn the merits of the case, the Respondent seeks an Award:\n\n- Assessing that the Respondent has not violated the Claimants' right or acted inconsistently with any of the Respondent' obligations under the BIT;\n\n- Rejecting the Request for Arbitration in its entirety as not grounded;\n\n- Compelling the Claimants to bear the Respondent's costs incurred by the preparation and prosecution of this arbitral proceeding, including fees and expenses of the arbitrators, legal counsel, experts and consultants fees, as well as the Respondent's own internal costs.\n\n88.\n\nFurther, the Respondent advances a counterclaim, requesting that Claimants be compelled to pay to the Respondent USD 20 million (plus costs) as damages caused to the Respondent because of the Claimants' failure to comply with their investment obligations and their mismanagement of Socomet.\n\n**VI. THE TRIBUNAL'S JURISDICTION OVER THE CLAIMS**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, for several reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims and that the claims are inadmissible. The Arbitral Tribunal will therefore discuss its jurisdiction over the Parties' dispute and the admissibility of the Claimants' claims in light of the relevant legal rules, *i.e.*, the ICSID Convention and the BIT.\n\n**A. Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Personae***\n------------------------------------------\n\n90.\n\nArticle 1(2) of the BIT applies to any \"natural or legal person being a national of either Contracting Party who effected, is effecting or has obliged himself to effect, investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party...\" It is not contested that both Mr. Marco Gavazzi and Mr. Stefano Gavazzi are Italian nationals and are thus covered by the BIT (to the extent they have effected investments in Romania). In addition, they qualify as \"nationals of another Contracting State\" under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. Jurisdiction** ***Ratione Materiae***\n------------------------------------------\n\n91.\n\nThe Respondent argues that (a) the purchase of the shares for an amount of USD 517,020 is not an \"investment\" for jurisdictional purposes and that (b) the Claimants have not made the necessary and agreed investments after their acquisition of the shares.76\n\nR-RPHB, paras. 98-108.\n\n92.\n\nAs a preliminary point, the Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent that in this arbitration the notion of \"investment\" has to be understood pursuant to Romanian law and Romanian judicial and arbitral practice, *i.e.*, that only \"participation in the company assets for the purpose of increasing the company share capital in exchange for an investor acquiring the equivalent shares\"77 can be considered an investment. Nor is it relevant, in the Tribunal's view, whether Romanian formalities have been followed so as to have the contribution recognised as an \"investment\" under Romanian law. The Tribunal decides that the only relevant issue is whether any contributions by the Claimants are to be considered as \"investments\" under the BIT and the ICSID Convention, as interpreted under international law.\n\nR-PHB, para.15; see also the Dissenting Opinion of Professor Dr. Dragos-Alexandru-Sitaru in the 2002 Romanian arbitration (R-3, at 13).\n\n*a)*  *The Claimants' Purchase of Shares in Socomet Qualifies as an \"Investment\" Under Article 1(1) of the BIT.*\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nArticle 1(1) of the BIT defines the term \"investment,\" in relevant part:\n\n*The term \"investment\" means every kind of assets owned by an investor of one Contracting Party, including goods, rights and financial means, invested in the territory of the other Contracting Party in accordance with its laws and regulations. The term includes in particular, though not exclusively:*\n\n*[... ]*\n\n*b. shares, stocks, debentures, other forms of participation in companies or partnerships incorporated in the territory of one Contracting Party and any other negotiable instrument of credit, as well as public securities in general*....78\n\nBIT, Art. 1(1) (English text) (C-4).\n\n94.\n\nThe Claimants assert that their purchase of 70 percent of the shares of Socomet qualifies as a protected investment according to the plain meaning of Article 1 of the BIT. It falls within the notion of \"every kind of assets owned by an investor\" and is covered by the listed protected investments (\"shares... in companies... incorporated in the territory of one Contracting Party\" (Article 1(1)(b)); \"claims to money or any right relating to obligations... having an economic or financial value connected with investments\" (Article 1(1)(d)); and \"rights of a financial nature accruing by law or by contract\" (Article 1(1)(f)).\n\n95.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that the Claimants meet the requirements of Article 1(1) of the BIT as regards their purchase and holding of shares in Socomet in Romania. However, the Tribunal accepts the Respondent's submission that Article 1(1) of the BIT must be applied together with Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.79 It does not suffice for the Claimants to meet only the requirements of Article 1(1) of the BIT.\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, para. 28.\n\n*b)*  *The Claimants' Purchase of Shares in Socomet Qualifies as an \"Investment\" Under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n96.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention limits the jurisdiction of ICSID to legal disputes arising directly out of an investment but does not define \"investment.\" The Respondent contends that, in establishing whether the Claimants have made an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal should follow the test established by the ICSID tribunal in *Salini Constuttori S.p.A. et al. v. Kingdom of Morocco* (the \" *Salini* test\").80 Under that test, so the Respondent submits, the investment requirement of the ICSID Convention is only satisfied when the operation of the foreign investor: (i) brings a contribution in money or other kinds of assets; (ii) has a certain duration; (iii) has an element of risk; and (iv) contributes to the host State's economic development. The Tribunal will discuss successively the various characteristics of the Claimants' alleged investments under the *Salini* test.\n\n*See* *Salini Constuttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4), Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 50-58 (23 July 2001).\n\n97.\n\nThe Tribunal accepts that the Claimants bear the burden of proving their alleged investments under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention.\n\n*(i) Acquisition of Shares as Investment*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n98.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimants' acquisition of the Socomet shares is not an investment in Romania and does not satisfy any of the criteria required by the *Salini* test.81 In support, in addition to *Salini*, the Respondent refers, *inter alia*, to the ICSID decisions and awards in *Phoenix Action*,82*Fakes*,83*Mitchell*,84*Pantechniki*,85 and *Joy Mining*.86 The Tribunal notes, however, that these cases do not concern direct investments in material assets located in the host State, as is the case here. According to the Respondent, the payment of the purchase price of the Claimants' 70 percent shareholding in Socomet to SOF was not a monetary contribution to the company under the ICSID Convention.87\n\nR-PHB, para. 42.\n\n*Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/5), Award (15 Apr. 2009).\n\n*Saba Fakes v. Republic of Turkey* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/20), Award (14 July 2010).\n\n*Patrick Mitchell v.

The Claimants cite, *inter alia*, *Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11), Award (12 Oct. 2005); *Spyridon Roussalis v. Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/1), Award, paras. 59-61 (7 Dec. 2011); *The Rompetrol Group N.V. v.

Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/20), Award (11 Dec. 2013).\n\n*(ii) Additional Investments*\n-----------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, besides their payment for the shares, their actual contribution to the Socomet project was sizeable.90 The Claimants point out that under Article 8.10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, they not only had to purchase the shares but also had to make additional investments for a minimum amount of USD 20,000,000 within five years after the share purchase. They submit that they had intended to take over the Socomet operations and actually had managed the Company for three years, repaired industrial equipment, set up a subsidiary to develop foreign markets, engaged Italian experts and provided financing.91 The Claimants also point out that, in spite of the blocked bank accounts, they were finalizing in May 2002 the installation of new technology which involved an investment of USD 27 million -well above the USD 20 million and well before the five year deadline, imposed by the Share Purchase Contract.92 However, ultimately, this commitment to additional investment - so the Claimants allege - could not be carried out because the Romanian bank refused its risk-free participation because of Socomet's blocked accounts.93\n\nC-PHB, para. 123.\n\n*Id.* para. 42.\n\n*Id.* para. 72.\n\n*Id.* para. 74.\n\n102.\n\nFor the Claimants, these investments undoubtedly meet the contribution criterion of the *Salini* test.\n\n103.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Claimants failed to achieve the agreed yearly investment obligation. The investment of USD 20 million provided by Article 8.10.1(a) of the Contract94 was \"not met,\"95 neither was the additionally agreed USD 2 million to invest in 2001 in the oxygen plant, the cooling water station, buildings and transformation unit96 completed.97 The investment project concerning the introduction of new technology was never carried out and, so the Respondent contends, cannot be considered at a hypothetical level, as a matter of mere possibility. The alleged USD 1,490,000 investment by converting Holdeast receivables cannot be considered as an investment, so the Respondent contends, as this amount was paid after the expiry of the agreed one-year term on 18 June 2002 and payment was not registered with the Trade Registry Office, as required by Article 8.10.2 of the Share Purchase Contract.98 Nor was it published in the Official Monitor of Romania.99\n\nThe parties amended Article 8.10.1(a) by Addendum No. 2 to the Share Purchase Contract of 7 July 2000, in which they agreed that the five-year period within which the Claimants were to make the investments and/or contributions would start to run on 24 June 2000 (\"Addendum no. 2/07.07.2000 to Share Sale Purchase Contract No. 145/19.04.1999 - SC Gavazzi Steel SA Otelu Rosu,\" Art. 1 (C-20)).\n\nThe Respondent contends that the USD 20 million had to be invested after the shares were paid, so that the latter payment cannot be included in the former amount. *See* R-RPHB, paras. 42-47.\n\n\"Addendum no. 2/07.07.2000 to Share Sale Purchase Contract No. 145/19.04.1999 - SC Gavazzi Steel SA Otelu Rosu,\" amendment to Annex No. 6 (C-20).\n\nR-PHB, paras. 31, 126.\n\n*Id.* paras. 29-30. Article Art. 8.10.2 of the Share Purchase Contract provides:  \n*The capital investment shall be considered fully achieved on the date of registration with the Trade Register Office of*  ***Company***  *of the nominal capital increase with their counter value or, as the case may be with the cash subscribed and fully paid capital, made by the*  ***Buyer***  *or a third Party he attracted.*  \n Share Purchase Contract, Art. 8.10.2 (C-19).\n\nFurthermore, with regard to the USD 1,490,000 contribution to capital, the Respondent argues that this investment in all events was carried out after the expiry of the one-year term and that it had not been carried out by 18 June 2002. *See* R-RPHB, paras. 48-52.\n\n104.\n\nThe Claimants contend that their alleged non-compliance with the Share Purchase Contract, including the alleged mismanagement of the Company and failure to register their investments with the Trade Register Office, are irrelevant for the purpose of the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The dispute brought before this Tribunal does not concern the Claimants' alleged breaches of the Share Purchase Contract, but the Respondent's breaches of the BIT.100 According to the Claimants, the Respondent cannot evade its international obligations vis-\u00e0-vis investments made by foreign investors in its territory under the BIT by relying on its own domestic law or irrelevant contractual interpretations.101 Moreover, so the Claimants point out, AVAS itself has indicated that the share registration had only to be carried out at the end of the five years.102\n\nC-RJ/CC, para. 30; C-PHB, para. 129\n\nC-RPHB, para. 50.\n\n*Id.* para. 6; letter AVAS/Gavazzi Steel S.A., 13 June 2001 (C-70).\n\n105.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimants' position. It notes that the ICSID Convention (or the BIT) imposes no monetary threshold to the notion of investment and takes the view that actual plans to invest may qualify as \"investments\" under the ICSID Convention. Consequently, in the view of the Arbitral Tribunal, not only the purchase price for the shares paid for the shares but also the Claimants' other commitments and plans towards the financing of Socomet constitute \"contributions\" satisfying this first element under the *Salini* test.\n\n*(iii) Duration*\n----------------\n\n106.\n\nEqually, so the Respondent continues, under the *Salini* test the Claimants' intended involvement in the activities of Socomet does not have the required duration to qualify as \"investment.\"\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimants point out that their involvement in the activities of Socomet was of notable duration.103 The Share Purchase Contract, for instance, provided that the Claimants would carry out additional investments after five years. In fact, the purpose of the Claimants' involvement in Socomet was to establish a lasting economic operation based upon their ability to manage Socomet. Their contribution to Socomet, so the Claimants contend, responded to the definition of \"Direct Investment\" in the OECD Code of Liberalisation of Capital Movements.104\n\nC-PHB, para. 123.\n\nOrganisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, OECD CODE OF LIBERALISATION OF CAPITAL MOVEMENTS (2013). C-RJ/CC, paras. 16-18; C-PHB, para. 124. The Claimants rely on the following portion of the OECD's definition of \"direct investment\":  \n*Investment for the purpose of establishing lasting economic relations with an undertaking such as, in particular, investments which give the possibility of exercising an effective influence on the management thereof:*  \n*A. In the country concerned by non-residents by means of:*  \n*1. Creation or extension of a wholly-owned enterprise, subsidiary or branch, acquisition of full ownership of an existing enterprise;*  \n*2. Participation in a new or existing enterprise...*\n\n108.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimants' case that the Claimants' involvement in Socomet had sufficient duration to qualify as an \"investment\" under the *Salini* test.\n\n*(iv) Risk*\n-----------\n\n109.\n\nFurther, so the Respondent contends, the Claimants did not assume the political risk typical of an investment and protected under the ICSID Convention. In fact, the Respondent asserts that the Claimants, professional investors, in any event, themselves caused the Socomet-project to fail by mismanaging the Company and not making their contractually required investments.105\n\nR-PHB, paras. 39-41.\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimants reiterate that the breaches by the Respondent of the BIT, which are subject of the present proceedings, precisely involve political risks against which the BIT protects the investor. The investment failed because of these political risks, not because of commercial risks.106\n\nC-RPHB, para. 55.\n\n111.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees with the Claimants' case. In its view, there was more than sufficient risk to qualify as an \"investment\" under the *Salini* test.\n\n*(v) Economic Development*\n--------------------------\n\n112.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimants did not contribute to the economic development of Romania, which the Respondent considers a decisive element for the qualification as \"investment.\" The Claimants contend that an \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention does not require a \"contribution to economic development.\" Referring to *Deutsche Bank A.G. v. Sri Lanka* and other ICSID decisions, the Claimants assert that this alleged requirement has been discredited and has not been adopted recently by any tribunal.107\n\n*Deutsche Bank A.G. v. Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/02), Award, para. 306 (31 Oct. 2012). *See* C-RJ/CC, para. 26; C-PHB, para. 126.\n\n113.\n\nIn any event, so the Claimants continue, their investment in Socomet in fact aimed at the economic development of Romania by injecting advanced technology into Socomet. Moreover, the Claimants made sizable investments in Socomet, by transferring over USD 2 million to the Company, by waiving claims against Socomet of roughly an equivalent amount, by granting loans and by paying salaries for key Italian expatriate personnel. The Claimants also revamped and modernized nonoperational equipment (including rolling mills, a glass-pot furnace, a shear-pressing machine) and repaired part of the infrastructure (such as internal bridges and roads, residential buildings, a school for workers' children). These improvements, so the Claimants maintain, have been recognized and listed in the Plan of Judicial Reorganization of Gavazzi Steel S.A. for 2004-2010 prepared by Iprolam S.A. and submitted by both Parties. The Respondent itself, so the Claimants point out, admitted that Socomet had, at least potentially, a substantive value after the Claimants' departure.108\n\nC-RJ/CC, paras. 27-28. *See* \"Plan of Judicial Reorganising of the Company S.C. Gavazzi Steel S.A. Otelu Rosu - According to Law No. 64/1995 republished, modified and completed\" (2004) & \"Plan of Judicial Reorganising of the Company S.C. Gavazzi Steel S.A. Otelu Rosu - Correlation of the Plan of Judicial Reorganising with the stipulations of the Government Decision No. 655/2004, approving the strategy for restructuring the siderurgical industry in Romania, for the period 2004-2010,\" both prepared by Iprolam S.A., Institute for Designing Rolling Sections and Plants, Bucharest (translated from Romanian into English) (C- 57; R-52).\n\n114.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal agrees that a contribution to an actual economic development of the host state is not always a *conditio sine qua non* to qualify as investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Indeed, if this were the case, an investment which was immediately prevented by wrongful acts or omissions of the host State could never qualify for protection as an investment, although such protection would be most needed in such a case. The circumstance that the Claimants' investment could only be made partially because of the Respondent's actions or omissions is thus no impediment to grant these investments the protection under the ICSID Convention, even when the investments failed and could no longer contribute to the economic development of Romania. The contribution to economic development should not be assessed *ex post facto*. Moreover, in this case, the Claimants' investments did not immediately fail: their management and the funds injected in Socomet were an initial contribution to the envisaged economic development of the Respondent.\n\n*c)*  *The 2007 Romanian Award as an \"Investment\"*\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimants have made an additional, subordinate claim that the Respondent breached Article 2(3)109 and Article 2(5)110 of the BIT, through the manner in which the Bucharest Court of Appeals annulled the 2007 Romanian Award and the Romanian courts exercised their judicial functions, in disregard of all applicable legal rules and standards.111 The Claimants assert that the Respondent was guilty of a denial of justice and due process through the abusive annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award by its national courts. According to the Claimants, abundant arbitral precedents confirm that abusive conduct by state courts in respect of, not only investment arbitration awards, but also commercial awards, may constitute a denial of justice and a violation of due process. ICSID tribunals are therefore competent, so the Claimants contend, to review such matters under BITs granting compensation for denial of justice.112\n\nArticle 2(3) of the BIT provides:  \n*Each Contracting Party shall offer in its territory a fair and equitable treatment for investments of investors of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, conversion, repatriation of capital, liquidation and disposal of investments as well as the local companies, partnerships or firms in which these investments have been made.*  \n BIT, Art. 2(3) (English text) (C-4).\n\nArticle 2(5) of the BIT provides:  \n*Each Contracting Party undertakes to provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to this present agreement, to the investment authorizations and properties. Each Contracting Party shall not impair the right of the investors of the other Contracting Party to have access to its Courts of justice, administrative Tribunals and agencies and all other bodies exercising adjudicatory authority*.  \n BIT, Art. 2(5) (English text) (C-4).\n\n*See supra* para. 79.\n\nIn support, the Claimants cite *Saipem S.p.A. v. People's Republic of Bangladesh* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07), Decision on Jurisdiction and Recommendation on Provisional Measures (21 Mar. 2007) and Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, *Commercial Arbitration before International Courts and Tribunals \u2014 Reviewing Abusive Conduct of Domestic Courts*, 2011 American University Washington College of Law Annual Lecture on International Commercial Arbitration, 29 (2) ARB. INT'L 153 (2013) (C-74). C-RJ/CC, paras. 71-73.\n\n116.\n\nIn any event, so the Claimants contend, the 2007 Romanian Award remains protected under the BIT because Article 1(1) of the BIT lists as protected investments, among other things, \"credits\" and \"claims to money or any right relating to obligations,\" and money awards and judgments are considered in international case law as property rights.113 The Claimants submit that \" *by annulling abusively the award that was rendered in the dispute concerning their rights acquired under the privatization contract, which transferred to them SOCOMET (their investment in the host country), Romania has breached their treaty rights concerning that investment.* \"114\n\nC-PHB, para. 146; C-RJ/CC, para. 74. In connection with the latter point, the Claimants cite ECHR, *Kin-Stib and Maijic v. Serbia* (Application) No. 12312/05, Judgment, at 83 (20 Apr. 2010).\n\nC-RJ/CC, para. 67.\n\n117.\n\nThe Claimants seek damages in the amount of the full value of the 2007 Romanian Award.\n\n118.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Tribunal's jurisdiction over the Claimants' additional subordinate claim. The Respondent, relying (inter alia) on the ICSID award in *GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v. Ukraine* of 31 March 2011,115 submits that the 2007 Romanian Award does not qualify as an investment under either the BIT or the ICSID Convention.116 The annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award does not \"arise directly\" out of the Claimants' alleged investment in Socomet, as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.117 The Respondent contends that the annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award cannot be a breach of the BIT as it follows directly from AVAS' exercise of its right to request such annulment pursuant to Article 364 of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure.118 In the Respondent's submission, this claim must therefore fall outside the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The right to request the annulment of an arbitral award, the Respondent asserts, is unrelated to any investment, predates the 2002 Romanian Arbitration, and is of general application.119\n\n*GEA Group Aktiengesellschaft v. Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/08/16), Award, paras. 161-62 (31 March 2011).\n\nR-PHB, para. 65; R-PO/CM/CC, paras. 138-140.\n\nR-PHB, paras. 43-66; R-PO/CM/CC, paras. 109-110, 121-42; R-RPHB para. 18-22.\n\nR-PHB, para. 50; R-PO/CM/CC, paras. 121-136. *See* Article 363 of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure (translated from Romanian into English) (R-6).\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, paras. 123, 128-134.\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimants, in turn, emphasize that they do not contend that the 2007 Romanian Award represents a distinct \"investment.\" Rather, the 2007 Romanian Award and the rights thereby recognized, giving rise to a claim for damages in favor of Messrs. Gavazzi against AVAS, are an integral part of the investment operation of the Claimants in Socomet and are protected as such under the BIT and the ICSID Convention. The BIT requires that the investment overall enjoy due process.120 For that reason, so the Claimants submit, the Tribunal should entertain, under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention, the claim relating to the annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award and the decision from the Romanian courts on the merits.\n\nC-PHB, para. 146.\n\n120.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal (by a majority) accepts the Claimants' case that an award which compensates for an investment made in the host State is a claim to money covered by the BIT as an investment. It also accepts, as regards Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, that, in the particular circumstances of this case, the 2007 Romanian Award forms part of the Claimants' overall investment.121 However, the Arbitral Tribunal also notes that the Claimants only claim compensation for the annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award as a \"subordinated\" claim in the event that their \"Principal Claim\" of breaches of the BIT is not accepted by the Tribunal.122 Accordingly, as will appear later from this Decision, this issue (including the difference within the Tribunal) is not material to this Decision's end-result.\n\n*White Industries Australia Limited v.

No Jurisdiction Over Share Purchase Contract Claims**\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n121.\n\nIn the Request for Arbitration, the Claimants claim also for non-compliance by the State-entity AVAS with the Share Purchase Contract. However, the Claimants have withdrawn their contractual claim based upon the Share Purchase Contract. Indeed, in their Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimants confirm that they are not bringing any claim based on the Share Purchase Contract.123 They are not claiming that AVAS' breach of the Share Purchase Contract was also a contractual breach by or attributable to the Respondent itself.\n\nC-PHB, para. 7.\n\n122.\n\nThe Tribunal takes note of the Claimants' confirmation that they are not claiming for breaches of the Share Purchase Contract.\n\n123.\n\nHowever, in the written pleadings, the Parties have argued at great length whether a claim based upon AVAS' alleged breach of the Share Purchase Contract would be admissible in the present proceedings since the counterclaim which Messrs. Gavazzi's submitted in 2002 to the Romanian arbitration tribunal, likewise concerned alleged breaches by AVAS of the Share Purchase Contract - a matter later also decided by the Romanian courts. Although the question is no longer before the Tribunal, out of courtesy to the Parties, which extensively have discussed the issue, the Tribunal will address the issue.\n\n124.\n\nBefore the Claimants clarified that they did not bring any claim under the Share Purchase Contract, they had indicated that such claim would be based upon Article 10(2) of the BIT, which the Claimants considered to be \"a kind of \u2018umbrella clause.'\"124 That provision states: \" *In case of specific contracts between an investor and either Contracting Party, the provisions of these* contracts *, without prejudice of the provisions of the present Agreement, will prevail for the concerned investor.* \"125\n\nC-Request para. 130.\n\nBIT, Art. 10(2) (English text) (C-4).\n\n125.\n\nThe Respondent accepts that a BIT's so-called \"umbrella clause\" could elevate a breach of a contract into a breach of a BIT and thus make it subject of an ICSID tribunal's jurisdiction. However, for the Respondent Article 10(2) of the BIT is not a proper \"umbrella clause.\"126\n\nR-PHB, paras. 105-108; R-PO/CM/CC, paras. 82-104.\n\n126.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Article 10 of the BIT is not to be interpreted as an \"umbrella clause.\" Consequently, Article 10 does not grant the Tribunal jurisdiction over claims based upon the Share Purchase Contract.\n\n127.\n\nUnder the scenario that the Tribunal would have jurisdiction over such claims - *quod non* - the Respondent argued that Article 8(2) of the BIT, the so-called \"fork in the road\" provision, would exclude such contractual claims, as the claims have already been brought before other jurisdictional fora.127 Indeed, the Claimants had already elected to bring these claims as a counterclaim before the Romanian arbitration institution, the forum upon which the Parties agreed in Article 13 of the Share Purchase Contract.128 By filing a counterclaim in the 2002 Romanian arbitration, the Respondent contends, the Claimants \"waived their right to pursue a similarly-grounded claim\" before ICSID.129 Once the investor has chosen a forum to resolve a certain dispute between the parties, so the Respondent submits, such choice is final; and the investor can no longer submit the same dispute to another jurisdictional forum.130 Moreover, the Claimants' subsequent actions in the Romanian courts following the annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award - in particular their appeal to the Romanian High Court of Cassation and Justice131 - confirm that the Claimants consented to the settlement of their claim by other fora than this Tribunal.132\n\nArticle 8(2) of the BIT reads as follows:  \n*In the event that such a dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months of the date of a writt[e]n application, the investor in question may submit the dispute, at his choice, for settlement to:*  \n*a) the Contracting Party's Court, at all instances, having territorial jurisdiction;*  \n*b) an ad hoc Arbitration Tribunal, in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the \"UN Commission on International Trade Law\" (UNCITRAL).... [;]*  \n*c) the \"International Centre for the Settlement of [I]nvestment Disputes\" for the* *application of the conciliation and arbitration procedures provided by [the] Washington* *Convention of 18th March 1965 on the \"Settlement of Investment Disputes as between States and Nationals of other States.\"*  \n*However, in specific contracts, investors and Contracting Parties may agree on disputes settlement procedures.*\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, para. 52. Article 13 of the Share Purchase Contract, titled \"Litigations,\" provides:  \n***Seller***  *and*  ***Buyer***  *hereby agree that the disputes deriving from the interpretation and execution of this*  ***Contract*** *, that cannot be settled on an amiable way, will be submitted to the Court of International Commercial Arbitration of the Romanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.*  \n Share Purchase Contract, Art. 13 (C-19).\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, para. 41.\n\nR-PHB, para. 74.\n\n*See supra infra* para. 79.\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, para. 53.\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that Article 8 of the BIT cannot be interpreted as a \"fork in the road\" clause. It does not offer the Claimants, for disputes arising out of the Share Purchase Contract, a mutually exclusive choice between the arbitration before the Court of International Commercial Arbitration of the Romanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, provided for by Article 13 of that Contract, and the dispute mechanism provided for by the BIT.\n\n129.\n\nConsequently, this Arbitral Tribunal decides that it has jurisdiction to hear the claims for breaches of the BIT submitted by the Claimants against the Respondent in this arbitration.\n\n**D. Jurisdiction Over Claims for Breaches of the BIT**\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n130.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that it did not breach the BIT because the Respondent never assumed any legal obligation toward the Claimants to reschedule debts and to waive penalties, neither in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 nor elsewhere. Under Article 18 of Romanian Law 37, the Prime Minister can issue individual administrative rescheduling acts. The legal procedure for obtaining such approval was established in the Privatization Law in force at the time and required that the Ministry of Finance issue a \"fiscal certificate\" for Socomet, on the basis of which a \"common order for rescheduling\" would be issued signed by the Minister of Finance.133 According to the Respondent, the Ministry of Finance never issued such \"fiscal certificate\" for Socomet because of the \"difficult fiscal status of the company.\"134 However, for the Claimants, this \"difficult fiscal status of the company\" was precisely due to the accumulated budget debts that were to be cancelled or rescheduled by the Respondent.135 Thus, so the Respondent concludes, because the procedure required by law for Government approval for the Restructuring of the Company's Debt was never followed, Government Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 was never vested with \"legal force and effect.\"136\n\nR-PHB, paras. 317-320.\n\n*Id.* para. 321.\n\nC-RPHB, para. 28 n.31.\n\nR-PHB, para. 7.\n\n131.\n\nHowever, in this case, according to the Respondent, all the necessary preliminary steps had not been carried out by the Ministry of Finance because the stipulated conditions for rescheduling did not meet the legal requirements of Government Ordinance No. 11/1996, Article 83, and (inter alia) the Claimants had not established a bank guarantee of 4.5 billion ROL.137 The Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 was therefore not a promise creating legal obligations for its signatories.138 It did not have the \"legal force and effect\" of an administrative act; and therefore it could not bind the Respondent.139\n\n*Id.* paras. 321-324; letter No. 443,604 dated 19 Oct. 1999 General Department for State Revenue Collection and Enforcement/Socomet (R-18).\n\nR-PHB, para. 316.\n\n*Id.* para. 6.\n\n132.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 is \"an administrative act of individual application,\"140 and the Claimants characterize the Note as an express approval of the rescheduling and waivers to which the Share Purchase Contract referred.141\n\nC-PHB, para. 36, n.38.\n\n*Id.* para. 19.\n\n133.\n\nIn the Respondent's submission, however, the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 was not issued by the Prime Minister in the exercise of his executive power, but was merely an \"internal communication,\" or a \"technical-administrative note,\"...\"from the Romanian Prime Minister to the various addressees, requesting their approval\"... \"prior to the issuance of an administrative act.\"142\n\nR-PHB, paras. 10, 316, 323.\n\n134.\n\nBesides, so the Respondent asserts, the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 had not been issued either by the Prime Minister or the Romanian Ministries involved, but rather by AVAS.143 In the Respondent's submission, AVAS merely requested that the competent authorities approve its proposal for the Restructuring of the Company's Debt.144 The Respondent finally points out that at the hearing, Mr. Marco Gavazzi confirmed that the Claimants were fully aware that Government Note No. 5/3228 had to be further implemented by an actual Order.145 For the Respondent, the Note represented nothing but a first step in the carrying out of a procedure aimed at obtaining the requested rescheduling.146\n\n*Id.* para. 326.\n\n*Id.* paras. 317, 319, 326.\n\nAt the hearing, Mr. Marco Gavazzi stated: \"[W]e asked that this promise will be turned into an effective order.\" Transcript of Hearing, 3 June 2014, at 410.\n\nR-RPHB, para. 65.\n\n135.\n\nFurther, so the Respondent contends, even if the procedure had been followed in full, the text of the Government's Note No. 5/3228 necessarily leads to the conclusion that the Note did not create any legal obligation assumed by the Respondent to allow the Restructuring of the Company's Debt. Indeed, the final sentence of the Note reads: *\"Considering the above, please approve the facilities regarding the payment of the said obligations of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu.\"*147 The words \"please approve\" make it clear for the Respondent that the signatories of the Note did not assume an obligation to reschedule and waive penalties, but that third parties had to carry out these matters, if approved.\n\nGovernment's Note No. 5/3228 dated 17 May 1999 (C-22) (translation from Romanian into English). *See supra* para. 54.\n\n136.\n\nThe Respondent concludes that the Government's Note No. 5/3228 did not, by itself, grant the Restructuring of the Company's Debt; rather, it must \"be construed as a favourable premise for the Claimants that they shall be granted the facilities in question, subject to the observance of the applicable legal provisions.\"148\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, para. 205 (emphasis omitted).\n\n137.\n\nAs a result, so the Respondent concludes, the Claimants have no cause of action against it under the BIT.149 Because the Tribunal's jurisdiction extends only to breaches of obligations under the BIT, the Claimants' claim falls outside its jurisdiction.\n\nPHB, paras. 11-12.\n\n138.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the issue whether the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 actually approved the rescheduling goes to the merits of the case and is not material to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction. At this stage, it is sufficient to note that not only the Claimants but also SOF in its 3 June 1999 Notice to the Claimants was of the opinion that the Prime Minister of Romania had approved the rescheduling.150 Consequently, for jurisdictional purposes an allegation of breach of the Government's commitments is sufficient to establish the Tribunal's jurisdiction.\n\nSOF Notice No. 1/4026 dated 3 June 1999 (C-21). *See supra* para. 52.\n\n**E. The Claim Is Not Time-Barred**\n-----------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent's final objection to the Tribunal's jurisdiction is that the claims are time-barred.151 In the case at stake - so the Respondent argues - the time-bar would be governed by the substantive law (*lex causae*), *i.e.*, Romanian law. Indeed, for the Respondent, because the Parties to this ICSID arbitration did not agree on the law applicable to the dispute, Romanian law applies as \"the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute,\" pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention.152 Moreover, as already indicated above, Article 14 of the Share Purchase Contract provides that the Contract is \"governed by the Romanian law.\"153 Consequently, in the Respondent's submission, any issue \"related to the execution\" of the Contract and \"any claim arising therefrom\" are \"to be settled in accordance with the legal framework provided by Romanian law.\"154\n\nR-RPHB, paras. 24-25.\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, paras. 5-7.\n\nShare Purchase Contract, Art. 14 (C-19).\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, para. 8.\n\n140.\n\nIn the Respondent's submission, the claims submitted in the present arbitration are time-barred because they were not submitted within the time period provided for under the applicable Romanian law155 - that is, within three years from the date on which the Claimants became aware, or should have become aware, of the alleged breach by Romania of \"its obligations.\"156\n\nIn support, the Respondent invokes provisions contained in Decree No. 167/1958 on the statute of limitations and the Romanian Civil Code.  \n Article 1 of Decree No. 167/1958 (R-10) provides:  \n*Unless exercised within the legally provided deadline, the right to action in respect of a patrimonial right is extinguished by limitation.*  \n*Once the right to action related to a primary right is extinguished, the right to action related to the ancillary rights will also be extinguished.*  \n Article 3 (1) of Decree No. 167/1958 provides, in relevant part:  \n*The limitation period is three years...*  \n The Respondent asserts that Article 7 of Decree No. 167/1958 states that the three -year period starts to run \"on the date when the right to claim is born.\" R-PO/CM/CC, para. 147.  \n The Respondent contends that the Romanian Civil Code of 1 October 2011 provides for a three -year statute of limitations (Article 2517), which starts to run \"on the date when the holder of the right to claim is aware or should become aware that such a right is born\" (Article 2523). R-PO/CM/CC, paras. 148-49.\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, para. 151.\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the statute of limitations for the Claimants' claims arising from the \"alleged non-observance\" by AVAS of its obligations under the Share Purchase Contract began to run in 1999-2001 when, according to the Claimants, AVAS failed to perform those obligations. By the time the Claimants submitted their Request for Arbitration on 23 July 2012, the statute of limitations had thus already elapsed.157\n\n*Id.* para. 153.\n\n142.\n\nMoreover, for the Respondent, the statute of limitations applies to the Claimants' denial-of-justice claim relating to the annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award. The prescription began to run on 22 April 2009, the date on which the Bucharest Court of Appeals issued its decision annulling that award.158 Indeed, by that date, so the Respondent contends, the Claimants were aware (or should have become aware) of their alleged losses.159 Referring (inter alia) to the decisions in *Mondev Int'l Ltd. v. United States of America*160 and *Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America,*161 the Respondent accordingly concludes that, by the time the Claimants submitted their Request for Arbitration on 23 July 2012, the statute of limitations relating to the Claimants' denial-of-justice claim had already elapsed, too.\n\nBucharest Court of Appeals, Commercial Section A VI-A *(Curtea de Apel Bucuresti, Sectia A VI-A* *Comerciala),* Commercial Decision No. 65 (Case No. 8799/2/2007), at 11 (22 Apr. 2009) (C-38 (English translation provided by the Claimants)).\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, paras. 154-63.\n\n*Mondev Int'l Ltd. v. United States of America* (ICSID Case No. ARB (AF)/99/2), Award, para. 87 (11 Oct. 2002).\n\n*Grand River Enterprises Six Nations, Ltd., et al. v. United States of America* (NAFTA) (UNCITRAL), Award (12 Jan. 2011).\n\n143.\n\nThe Claimants deny that their claims can be time-barred by operation of Romanian law. According to the Claimants, only international law (the law governing the arbitration proceedings as well as the dispute, *i.e.*, the alleged breach by Respondent of provisions of the BIT) can determine whether their claims are time-barred. No time-bar within which an investor must submit a claim to ICSID is established in the BIT, the ICSID Convention or the Rules of Arbitration.162\n\nC-RJ/CC, paras. 81-82, 87; C-PHB, paras. 150-151.\n\n144.\n\nIn any event, the Claimants assert, their claim would not be time-barred even if, *arguendo*, Romanian law were applicable. Indeed, under Article 16(b) and Article 17 of Romanian Decree No. 167/1958 on the statute of limitations, the three-year time-bar would have been interrupted multiple times, and after each interruption, a new period of three years would have to restart.163 Specifically, the three-year period would have been interrupted when AVAS initiated the 2002 arbitration, restarted when the award was rendered on 30 October 2007, to be stopped again when AVAS commenced proceedings seeking annulment of the 2007 Award.164\n\nArticle 16 (b) of Decree No. 167/1958 provides:  \n*The statute of limitation period is interrupted:... (b) by the submission of a writ of summons or request for arbitration, even if such request was submitted with an incompetent court of law or arbitration body...*  \n Article 17 of Decree No. 167/1958 provides in full:  \n*The interruption discards the statute of limitation commenced prior to the occurrence of* *the event that interrupted it.*  \n*After interruption, a new statute of limitation period begins.*  \n*If the statute of limitation was interrupted by a writ of summons or a request for arbitration or by a deed initiating enforcement, the new statute of limitation will not run as long as the decision to admit the request is not final or, in case of enforcement, until the performance of the last enforcement action.* (C-73).\n\nThe Respondent argues that in fact the statute of limitations of the claims which were not allowed by the court proceedings in File 8799/2/2007 was not interrupted by these proceedings (R-PHB, para.114). However as the three-year time bar under Romanian law is not applicable, this assertion does not affect the general outcome of the decision.\n\n145.\n\nThe Claimants had already started the BIT dispute settlement process by submitting their written request for amicable settlement required under Article 8 of the BIT to Romania on 20 July 2011, long before the Romanian High Court of Cassation and Justice had issued the last decision in these proceedings on 23 February 2012 and the three-year time-bar could restart for the Claimants' claims in these proceedings.165 Even for the claims that were dismissed by the Bucharest Court of Appeal on 22 April 2009, if a three-year time-bar applied - *quod non*, the three-year statute of limitations would start to run from that date but would not have resulted in a time bar on 20 July 2011, when proceedings under Article 8 of the BIT started.\n\nC-RJ/CC, paras. 83-85; C-PHB, paras. 152-154. Article 8 of the BIT provides, in relevant part:  \n*1) Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of that investor in the territory of the former Contracting Party, including disputes relating to compensation for expropriation and disputes relating to the amount of its relevant payments shall be settled, as far as possible, amicably by consultation and negotiations between the parties to the dispute.*  \n*2) In the event that such a dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months of the date of a writt[e]n application, the investor in question may submit the dispute, at his choice, for settlement to: [...]*  \n BIT, art. 8 (1)-(2) (English text) (C-4). *See* letter of 20 July 2011 from Stefano and Marco Gavazzi to H.E. Traian Basescu, President of Romania (C-41).\n\n146.\n\nBesides, if any national law should be applicable, the Claimants submit (opposed by the Respondent)166 that it would be Italian law because the Claimants derive their rights under the BIT from its Italian ratifying Law No. 704/1994. Under Article 2943 and 2946 of the Italian Civil Code, the statute of limitations on all rights is generally ten years; however, it is interrupted by the filing of judicial or arbitral claims and only restarts once the related judicial or arbitral proceedings are terminated.167\n\nR-RPHB, paras. 26-29\n\nC-RJ/CC, para. 86; C-PHB, para. 155.\n\n147.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that the Claimants' claims are not time-barred. In arbitration proceedings governed by international law, only international law - and no domestic law - can introduce time-bars.168 Neither the ICSID Convention, nor the BIT, nor international law in general contains any statute of limitations in relation to treaty claims. Without such clear legal provision, no time-bar can operate to bar an ICSID arbitration.\n\n*See, e.g.*, the award of the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in *Alan Craig* and *Ministry of Energy of Iran, et al.*, Award No. 71-346-3 (2 Sept. 1983), *reprinted in* 3 IRAN-U.S. C.T.R. 280, 287.\n\n**F. The Majority's Views on Jurisdiction Over the Counterclaim**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n148.\n\nThe Respondent has advanced a counterclaim against the Claimants of USD 20 million (plus costs) for damages, because of the Claimants' alleged failure to comply with their investment obligations and their alleged mismanagement of Socomet, which, according to the Respondent, culminated in Socomet's insolvency, deprived the Respondent of key industrial assets, and led to losses of jobs and local economic decline. The counterclaim is based on the alleged breach of a number of legal provisions under Romanian law.169\n\nThe Respondent has specified that its Counterclaim is not a tort claim based upon the Claimants' alleged violation of Romanian tax law, as the Claimants suggested (C-PHB, para. 161). *See* R-RPHB, para. 132;\n\n149.\n\nThe Respondent submits that a counterclaim against the Claimants is admissible if the basis of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, the BIT, provides for the possibility for the Host State to advance a counterclaim against the investor. Moreover, the procedural framework of the present arbitration proceedings, more specifically Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 40 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, regulates the modalities for advancing such a counterclaim.\n\n150.\n\nFor the Respondent, its right to submit a counterclaim under the BIT has to be presumed, as the BIT has not expressly excluded such counterclaim.\n\n151.\n\nThe Tribunal has noted that the BIT, in the second paragraph of its Preamble, indicates that it aims at *\"a stable framework... and maximum effective utilization of economic resources of either country*,\" and, in Article 8(1), the BIT refers to \" *[a]ny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of that investor in the territory of the former Contracting Party.* \" Such language may seem to indicate that also the claims of the Host State against the investor should be covered by the BIT. However, whereas Article 8(1) of the BIT suggests amicable consultation and negotiations with respect to \"[a]ny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor,\" Article 8(2) of the BIT only grants the investor the right to claim against the Host State.\n\n152.\n\nThe Tribunal has pondered how to interpret the absence of an express mention in Article 8(2) that the Host State may claim against the investor. It has noted that, under Article 8(3),170 the Host State may elaborate its defence against the investor's claim and has considered why the Host State should be limited to opposing the investor's claims and not be entitled to install a counterclaim. As a matter of form, a counterclaim can be pleaded as a claim operating by way of defence to an investor's claim or as a free-standing claim by the Host State against the investor. In substance, however, there is a significant difference between a defence and a free-standing claim.\n\nArticle 8(3) of the BIT provides:  \n*The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall at no time whatever during the procedures involving investment disputes, asse[r]t as a defence its immunity as well as the fact that the investor has received compensation under an insurance Contract covering the whole or part of the incurred damage or loss.*  \n BIT, Art. 8(3) (English text) (C-4).\n\n153.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered whether the omission of any express mention of the Host State's right to file a counterclaim is due to the fact that the drafters of the BIT focused on the protection of the investor. It has also considered whether this omission actually excludes any counterclaim by the Host State against the investor before the arbitration forum provided for by the BIT. It has been considered whether the Respondent's counterclaim is for damages caused by the investor, which, in the Respondent's contention, arise from the investment - or more precisely the failure of investments -and thus allegedly from the same subject matter as the Parties' dispute. Since the counterclaim is allegedly an extension of the Respondent's defence against the claim, so the Respondent submitted, the Tribunal was invited to consider that such counterclaim is included within the consent of the Parties to arbitrate before the Tribunal their dispute arising from the investment. It further has been raised within the Tribunal whether the BIT's Contracting Parties intended to avoid parallel proceedings and conflicting decisions before different courts and tribunals by preventing the Host State from asserting its rights against the investor in a counterclaim; and whether such exclusion would not be a breach of natural justice.\n\n154.\n\nThe Tribunal (by a majority), however, does not accept that the right of the Host State to file a free-standing counterclaim in an investment treaty arbitration should be presumed unless expressly excluded by the BIT. The majority considers that it is the letter of the BIT, interpreted under international law, that binds the Parties. Where there is no jurisdiction provided by the wording of the BIT in relation to a counterclaim, no jurisdiction can be inferred merely from the \"spirit\" of the BIT. For the majority, it is not unusual for parties to be in asymmetrical positions when a dispute relating to a BIT arises. The majority further observes that the counterclaim submitted by the Respondent is an entirely independent claim based upon Romanian law and unrelated to the Claimants' claim based upon breaches of the BIT. Both in form and substance, it is a free-standing counterclaim not operating merely as a defence to the Claimants' claim. Besides, it is significant that, in the Romanian arbitration and Romanian court proceedings, AVAS' claim for compensation for damage allegedly caused by Messrs. Gavazzi's alleged failure to invest and mismanagement, to a substantial extent overlaps with the subject-matter of the Respondent's counterclaim, submitted in these proceedings.\n\n155.\n\nFurther, for the Respondent, Article 8(2) of the BIT provides that the international law provisions of the BIT can be supplemented by Romanian law, applicable to the Share Purchase Contract. Romanian law allows for a counterclaim. Therefore, for the Respondent, \"it is logical and entirely reasonable to conclude that the Claimants and the Respondent, as parties subject to the Italy-Romanian BIT, would also be subject to their rights and obligations arising from Romanian law.\"171\n\nR-PHB, para. 480.\n\n156.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the BIT does not indicate that Romanian law applies to the substance of disputes. Article 8(2) of the BIT does not import Romanian law as substantive law to decide claims and counterclaims. By concluding the BIT, the Contracting Parties agreed to apply the BIT and international law to disputes for breaches of the BIT. Further, for the Tribunal, it is difficult to accept that two States, parties to a treaty, have agreed to be subject to a domestic law chosen in a later contract, concluded by one of the States and private third persons.\n\n157.\n\nAs for the ICSID Convention, Article 42 of the ICSID Convention - to which the Respondent also refers - only recognises that, in the absence of an agreement of the parties on the applicable law, the law of the Host State may apply to investment contracts, which are the direct subject-matter of the ICSID arbitration. However, in the present proceedings, not breaches of the Share Purchase Contract, but breaches of the BIT are the subject-matter of the present arbitration. Therefore, the reference to the domestic law of the Host State as the law on the merits in Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, is irrelevant in the present case.\n\n158.\n\nMoreover, the BIT does not indicate that Romanian law would apply to the procedural aspects of the dispute settlement provided by the BIT. Article 8(2) does not make Romanian procedural law applicable to this arbitration. Article 42 of the ICSID Convention, does not refer at all to the procedural law of the Host State. On the contrary, Article 44 expressly states that the procedure before ICSID Tribunals is regulated by the ICSID Convention itself (as supplemented by the Arbitration Rules).\n\n159.\n\nThe Majority therefore concludes that the BIT does not entitle the Respondent to advance in the present proceedings a free-standing counterclaim.\n\n160.\n\nMoreover, even if such counterclaim would be possible under the BIT - *quod non* the counterclaim needs also to be admissible under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Article 40 of the Arbitration Rules, which require that counterclaims (a) arise \"directly from the subject-matter of the dispute;\" (b) are within the scope of consent of the parties; and (c) are within ICSID's jurisdiction.\n\n161.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, for the Majority, the subject-matter of the counterclaim, *i.e.*, violations of Romanian domestic law, do not directly arise from the breaches of the BIT, being the subject-matter of the present proceedings. Moreover, nothing in the BIT allows the Majority to conclude that the counterclaim advanced by the Respondent falls within the scope of claims which could be brought in the present proceedings under Article 8(2) of the BIT.\n\n162.\n\nOn the basis of these considerations, the Majority concludes that it has no jurisdiction to decide upon the Respondent's counterclaim.\n\n**VII. NO** ***RES JUDICATA*** **OR ISSUE ESTOPPEL BECAUSE OF ROMANIAN COURT JUDGMENTS**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal has extensively considered in great detail the impact upon the present proceedings of the judgment of the Bucharest Court of Appeals of 16 March 2011 (confirmed by the Court of Cassation of Romania). The Court of Appeals set aside the 2007 Romanian Award, decided the merits in AVAS and rejected the counterclaim made by Messrs. Gavazzi, which was based on the conduct and omissions by AVAS. The judgment of 16 March 2011 decided only on contractual claims and counterclaims and found, under Romanian law, that AVAS had not breached the Share Purchase Contract. The present proceedings concern treaty claims; and this Tribunal has to decide, under international law, whether the Respondent was in breach of Article 2(5) of the BIT, which, in the Claimants' submission, has adversely affected the Claimants' rights as investors under the BIT.\n\n164.\n\nThe Tribunal has examined whether the decision on the merits of the Bucharest Court of Appeals (confirmed by the Court of Cassation of Romania), denying the Claimants compensation for the non-rescheduling and non-waiver of public debts, has conclusive effects on the Parties to the present proceedings under the doctrine of *res judicata* or issue estoppel. If this were the case, the issue whether the Claimants would be entitled to compensation because their rights have been adversely affected could become moot. May this Tribunal find, in spite of the Bucharest Court of Appeals' final judgment denying the Claimants compensation under the Share Purchase Contract, that the rights of the Claimants as investors under the BIT have been violated and that the Respondent is liable for any violation of its treaty commitments? From its perspective as an international tribunal formed under the BIT, the Tribunal applies international law as the law applicable to these questions.\n\n165.\n\nIn deliberating the issue, the Tribunal considered various legal materials, including the recurring opinions expressed in the decisions in *Apotex Holdings et al v. United States of America*,172*Amco v. Indonesia*,173*The Pious Funds of the Californias*,174*The Orinoco Case*,175*Grynberg v. Grenada*,176 and *Diag Human SE v. Czech Republic*.177\n\n*Apotex Holdings Inc. and Apotex Inc. v.

Czech Republic*, Judgment, [2014] EWHC 1639 (English Commercial Court, June 2014).\n\n166.\n\nUnder international law, three conditions need to be fulfilled for a decision to have binding effect in later proceedings: namely, that in both instances, the object of the claim, the cause of action, and the parties are identical.178\n\n*See Apotex v. United States of America*. The Tribunal has already discussed these three conditions in a different context, when it considered whether the proceedings before the Romanian arbitration court excluded Gavazzi's claim under the Share Purchase Contract in the present proceedings under an alleged \"fork-in-the-road\" provision in the BIT (*see supra* paras. 126-127128). As will be recalled, however, the Tribunal did not find that the BIT contained such a \"fork-in-the-road\" provision; moreover, the Claimants affirmed that they were not claiming for a breach of the Share Purchase Contract in the present proceedings.\n\n*(1) Object of the Claim*\n-------------------------\n\n167.\n\nFor the Respondent, although the *object* of the 2002 Romanian arbitration and the present proceedings are worded and assessed in different manners, the remedy sought is the same and therefore \"identity of object cannot be rejected.\"179 For the Respondent, the object of Claimants' counterclaim in the Romanian arbitration and of their claim in the present proceedings is identical. In both instances, the relief they seek for the alleged breaches is compensation through payment of pecuniary damages.180\n\nR-PHB, para. 95.\n\nR-RPHB, para. 9.\n\n168.\n\nBy contrast, the Claimants contend that the subject matters of the dispute in the 2002 arbitration and in the present ICSID proceedings are different. The fact that a contractual claim and a treaty claim might both aim at obtaining monetary damages (even in similar amounts) is of no relevance; and it does not undermine the well-established distinction between treaty claims and contractual claims.181 At issue in the 2002 Romanian arbitration was the alleged compliance with - or the alleged breach of - the Share Purchase Contract by either AVAS or Messrs. Gavazzi and the consequences in the light of the applicable Romanian law. At issue in the present ICSID proceedings are the alleged breaches of the BIT by the Respondent to the alleged prejudice of the Claimants as Italian investors protected by the BIT under international law.182\n\nC-RPHB, para. 51.\n\nC-RJ/CC, paras. 33, 47-54.\n\n*(2) Cause of Action*\n---------------------\n\n169.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Romanian arbitration and the present proceedings concern the same *cause of action* : in both instances the Claimants refer to the alleged breaches by the Respondent of the Share Purchase Contract and of the BIT.183 Indeed, so the Respondent contends, the claims submitted in the present proceedings, although formally for breaches of the BIT, are in fact contractual claims based upon the Share Purchase Contract.\n\nR-RPHB, para. 10.\n\n170.\n\nThe Claimants, for their part, argue that the objects of the disputes involved in the 2002 arbitration and in the present ICSID proceedings are different. The remedies sought in the former were the termination of the Share Purchase Contract; the reciprocal restitution of payments made and of shares bought; and damages for breach of contract measured in accordance with Romanian law as *damnum emergens* plus *lucrum cessans*. By contrast, the remedies sought in the present ICSID arbitration are: ascertaining of breaches of the BIT by the Respondent and compensation for an international wrong (unfair treatment and expropriation) equivalent to the value of the lost property.184\n\nC-RJ/CC, paras. 33, 55-57.\n\n171.\n\nThe Tribunal (by a majority) finds that the claims before the Tribunal are based upon a breach of the BIT, and their decision turns on the respective provisions of the BIT, while in the proceedings before the Bucharest Court of Appeals, the claims were for breach of the Share Purchase Contract governed by Romanian law, and their decision turned on the duties and rights under that Contract.\n\n172.\n\nConsequently, the present proceedings and the Bucharest Court proceedings had a different cause of action. Under international law, as confirmed by several precedents,185 there is no identity between the cause of the contractual claims put before the Romanian courts and that of the BIT claims put before this Tribunal. For this reason alone, the majority concludes that the Bucharest court decisions cannot have conclusive [] effect for the Tribunal under the doctrines of *res judicata* and issue estoppel.\n\nSee *Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Eaux) v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, paras. 90-91 (3 July 2002) paras. 95-96; *Impregilo S.p.A. v.

Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29), Decision on Jurisdiction, paras. 148 and 268 (14 Nov. 2005).\n\n*(3) The Parties*\n-----------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the *Parties* in the 2002 Romanian arbitration and in the present proceedings are in fact the same. Although AVAS was a party in the 2002 arbitration and the Respondent is a party in the present proceedings, the Respondent argues that AVAS' actions are in the present arbitration attributable to the Respondent, while in the 2002 arbitration the Claimants (as Messrs. Gavazzi in their counterclaim against AVAS) argued that AVAS' breaches also encompassed alleged breaches by the Ministries of Finance, Health and Social Protection, *i.e.*, all executive organs of the Respondent.186 However, for the Claimants, the 2002 Romanian arbitration and these ICSID proceedings involved different parties. The parties to the former were AVAS and Messrs. Gavazzi, whereas the parties to the latter are the Claimants (Messrs. Gavazzi) and the Respondent. While AVAS is a public body that depends on the Government of Romania, under Romanian law it has a distinct legal personality, is organized pursuant to its own articles of incorporation, and is managed by its own Board.187 The Claimants point out that AVAS was the Respondent in the 2002 Romanian arbitration.\n\nR-RPHB, para 8.\n\nC-RJ/CC, paras. 42-46.\n\n174.\n\nThe circumstance that there is no identity between the relevant parties to the different proceedings188 only confirms to the majority that the Bucharest Court decision, denying the Claimants any compensation for non-rescheduling and non-waiver, has no conclusive effect under the doctrines of *res judicata* or issue estoppel with respect to the present proceedings.\n\nIn the Romanian court proceedings, the State of Romania was not a party to the Share Purchase Contract that was the subject-matter of the dispute, and AVAS, having its own legal personality under Romanian law, was not identical to the State of Romania. For this Tribunal, the State of Romania cannot be equated to AVAS; moreover, the Claimants do not hold the State of Romania responsible for breaches of the Share Purchase Contract (C- PHB para.7).\n\n**VIII. THE MERITS**\n--------------------\n\n**A. The Principal Claims**\n---------------------------\n\n175.\n\nThe Claimants assert that Romania's authorities failed to carry out the Restructuring of the Company's Debt, which had been promised to the Claimants, by the following acts or omissions:\n\n(1) The Government of Romania and the relevant Ministries of Romania failed to carry out the Restructuring of the Company's Debt as indicated in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.\n\n(2) The Ministry of Finance granted Socomet a more limited debt restructuring in its letter to the Claimants of 19 October 1999 and subsequently failed to carry out this more limited restructuring.\n\n(3) The Ministry of Industry failed to release Socomet from its debts to the National Electricity Company CONEL S.A. and the National Company ROMGAZ S.A.\n\n(4) The Government of Romania granted Socomet a more limited debt restructuring in its Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001 and subsequently failed to carry out this more limited restructuring.189\n\nIn their Request for Arbitration, the Claimants appeared to claim compensation under the alleged \"umbrella clause\" of Article 10(2) of the BIT for AVAS' failure to comply with its contractual obligation under the Share Purchase Contract to bring about the Restructuring of the Company's Debt. However, as the Tribunal has decided above, Article 10 of the BIT is not to be interpreted as an \"umbrella clause\" (para. 123). Moreover, in later submissions, the Claimants confirmed that they actually did not bring any claim based on the Share Purchase Contract, but only on the Respondent's breaches of the BIT itself. (C-PHB para. 7) Consequently, the Tribunal need not here discuss AVAS' alleged failure to comply with the Share Purchase Agreement.\n\n176.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, the acts and omissions of the Romanian Prime Minister and the three Ministers, all of whom signed Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 in their official capacity as members of the Government of Romania and were competent to bring about the promised Restructuring of the Company's Debt, are attributable to Romania under international law, because the Government is an entity of the Romanian State.190 The Claimants contend that, through breaches (1) - (4) listed above, the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article 2(3) of the BIT and has unlawfully deprived the Claimants of their investment under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\nC-Request, para. 113.\n\n177.\n\nAdditionally and subordinately, the Claimants aver that the Bucharest Court of Appeals abusively annulled the 2007 Romanian Award and that the Romanian courts wrongly exercised their judicial functions with respect to the contractual dispute between AVAS and Gavazzi. The Claimants contend that the Romanian courts are likewise organs of the Romanian State, and that their acts and omissions are therefore equally attributable to the Respondent. By annulling the 2007 Romanian Award and deciding the merits of the contractual dispute between AVAS and Gavazzi, so the Claimants contend, the Respondent has deprived the Claimants of their investment under Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT.\n\n178.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the acts and omissions of the Members of the Government, the respective Ministries, the governmental administrations, and the courts in relation to the Claimants' investment are attributable to the Respondent. Therefore, the Tribunal will proceed to examine the Claimants' allegations that the Respondent has:\n\n(a) not respected the \"fair and equitable standard\" (Article 2(3) of the BIT); and\n\n(b) unlawfully deprived the Claimants of their investment (Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT).\n\n179.\n\nGiven the end-result of this Decision, the Tribunal need not here address the Claimants' subordinate claim that the Respondent failed to provide the Claimants with effective means to assert their claims and enforce their rights under Article 2(5) of the BIT. However, the Tribunal will nonetheless do so briefly, as a matter of courtesy to the Parties' submissions and also because the issue may be relevant to costs.\n\n*a)*  *\"Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard\" Not Respected (Article 2(3) of the BIT)*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n180.\n\nArticle 2(3) of the BIT provides:\n\nEach Contracting Party shall offer in its territory a fair and equitable treatment for investments of investors of the other Contracting Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary, unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, conversion, repatriation of capital, liquidation and disposal of investments as well as the local companies, partnerships or firms in which these investments have been made.191\n\nBIT, Art. 2(3) (English text) (C-4). The final paragraph of the BIT states that the BIT was done \"in three original copies, each in Italian, Romanian and English languages, all texts being equally authentic\" and provides that in case of \"differences of interpretation,\" the English text \"shall be considered as the text of reference.\"\n\n*(i) The Parties' Contentions*\n------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment standard contained in Article 2(3) of the BIT (\"Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard\") through the Romanian government authorities' unjustified failure to accord the Claimants' investment the treatment that was promised to them. More specifically, the Claimants argue that, in not carrying out the promised Restructuring of the Company's Debt, which was an essential and explicit condition for the Claimants to sign the Share Purchase Contract, the Respondent breached the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard. According to the Claimants, the Romanian authorities have thus engaged in \" *arbitrary* \" and \" *discriminatory* \" measures that \" *impair* [ed]\" and, ultimately, destroyed the \" *management, maintenance, use, [and] enjoyment* \" of the Claimants' investment in \" *local companies* \" within the meaning of Article 2(3) of the BIT.192 The Claimants submit that this conduct is \" *manifestly inconsistent, nontransparent, unreasonable* (*i.e.* unrelated to some rational policy), *or discriminatory* (*i.e.* based on unjustifiable distinctions),\"193 and in breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard.194\n\nC-PHB, para. 78.\n\n*Saluka Investments BV (The Netherlands) v. Czech Republic*, Partial Award (UNCITRAL), para. 309 (17 Mar. 2006) (emphasis added).\n\nC-PHB, paras. 78-79.\n\n182.\n\nThe Claimants further argue that the Respondent created a legitimate expectation on the Claimants' part that it would carry out the Restructuring of the Company's Debt by its solemn promise in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.195 That promise, according to the Claimants, induced the Claimants to pay the second installment under the Share Purchase Contract and to perform its contractual obligations, which the Claimants otherwise would not have done, and which performance caused them great damage. By acting contrary to its explicit promises to the Claimants in respect of their investment, the Claimants argue, the Respondent has breached the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard of Article 2(3) of the BIT.196 In support of this argument, the Claimants refer to several decisions by ICSID tribunals that reached the same conclusion in analogous circumstances.197 For instance, the Claimants point out that the ICSID tribunal in *Total v. Argentina* decided:\n\n*117.... The expectation of the investor is undoubtedly \"legitimate\", and hence subject to protection under the fair and equitable treatment clause, if the host State has explicitly assumed a specific legal obligation for the future, such as by contracts, concessions or stabilisation clauses on which the investor is therefore entitled to rely as a matter of law.*\n\n*118. The situation is similar when public authorities of the host country have made the private investor believe that such an obligation existed through conduct or by a declaration. Authorities may also have announced officially their intent to pursue a certain conduct in the future, on which, in turn, the investor relied in making investments or* *incurring costs. As stated within the NAFTA framework \"the concept of \u2018legitimate expectations' relates... to a situation where a* *Contracting Party's conduct creates reasonable and justifiable* *expectations on the part of an investor (or investment) to act in reliance on said conduct, such that a failure by the NAFTA party to honour those expectations could cause the investor (or investment) to suffer* *damages.\"*198\n\n*See supra* para. 54\n\nC-Request, paras. 108, 121; C-PHB, para. 80.\n\nThe Claimants cite, among others, *MTD Equity Sdn.

The Respondent denies that it ever promised the Claimants that it would carry out the Restructuring of the Company's Debt described in Article 10.1(b) of the Share Purchase Contract. In the Respondent's view, the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 was merely an internal communication from the Prime Minister to the various addressees, requesting the approval of the proposed debt rescheduling within the limits of the applicable law. For the Respondent, that Note did not, by itself, grant the Restructuring of the Company's Debt, as sought by the Claimants. It was only \"a favourable premise\" to grant the Claimants a restructuring of Socomet's debts, subject to the observance of the applicable legal provisions.199\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, para. 205.\n\n184.\n\nThe Claimants take a diametrically opposite view, arguing that the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 was not merely an internal memorandum. On the contrary, it was a true administrative decision \"of individual application\" addressed to the Claimants and SOF.200 The Claimants moreover emphasize that SOF, another State authority, explicitly confirmed in its Note No. P/2994 of 28 May 1999 to the Romanian Minister of Industry and Commerce that the Romanian Prime Minister had approved the Restructuring of the Company's Debt.201 Also, APAPS, the successor of SOF, confirmed that the Rescheduling, as described in the Government's Note No. 5/3228, had been \"approved in the session of the Government of Romania held on 17.05.1999.\"202\n\nC-RPHB, paras. 18-19.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 30, 38; C-RPHB, para. 18. *See supra* para. 55.\n\nSubstantiation Note, issued by APAPS and Ministry of Finance (C-32). *See supra* para. 66.\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent points out that the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 had a limited scope. The Note did not provide for a rescheduling of all public debts. Only payments to the State Budget, to the Social and Health Insurance Budget and to Special Funds were included within the scope of the Note; payments for supplementary pension, for the unemployment help fund and for the health insurance fund, were not covered.\n\n186.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent asserts that, in any event, SOF performed its obligations under Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract to facilitate the rescheduling of Socomet's budget debts.203 For instance, within 40 days after the signature of the Share Purchase Contract, SOF requested the Minister of Industry and Commerce to approve the restructuring of Socomet's debts and the cancellation of delay penalties owed to its electricity and gas suppliers, CONEL S.A. and ROMGAZ S.A.204 SOF thus fulfilled its obligation under Article 10.1(c) of the Share Purchase Contract \"to exert all diligence\" and to \"support\" the Claimants in achieving the rescheduling of the Company's debts to those two companies.205 In fact, the Respondent asserts, these debts were rescheduled.206\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, paras. 194-200; R-PHB, paras. 329-40.\n\nNote No. P/2994 of 28 May 1999 (C-23). *See supra* para. 55.\n\nR-PHB, paras. 357-359.\n\nIn support of this assertion, the Respondent relies on  \n (i) a letter dated 7 October 1999 from S.C. Distrigaz-Nord S.A. (one of ROMGAZ' successors) to S.C. Gavazzi Steel S.A. (R-23) (in its letter, S.C. Distrigaz-Nord S.A., among other things, made the October 1999 \"internal natural gas supply program\" for Gavazzi Steel S.A. contingent on the Company making specified payments and submitting a number of promissory notes);  \n (ii) a \"Debt Rescheduling Report\" dated 29 May 1999, signed by Stefano Gavazzi on behalf of S.C. Gavazzi Steel S.A., on the one hand, and S.C. Electrica S.A. (one of CONEL S.A.'s successors) through its subsidiary Exploatarea de Distributie Resita, on the other (R-24); and  \n (iii) a \"Debt Rescheduling Report\" dated 22 April 2002 signed by S.C. Gavazzi Steel S.A. and S.C. Electrica S.A. (R-25).\n\n187.\n\nLikewise, the Respondent asserts that the rescheduling of the other debts within the scope of Article 10.1(b) had been carried out. For instance, the Romanian Ministry of Finance did, in accordance with the applicable law, reschedule the tax debts on 19 October 1999207 and did cancel the related penalties.208 The Claimants, in their letter of 3 December 1999 to the Otelu Rosu tax authorities, accepted the rescheduling.209 The Respondent further alleges that Socomet received additional payment facilities with respect to its debts to the State Social Insurance and Health Insurance Budgets.210\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the rescheduling of a company's debts to the State Budget is only possible under the procedure laid down in Government Ordinance No. 11/1996 on the Enforcement of Budget Debts (R-15), as amended and supplemented by Government Ordinance No. 53/1997 and subsequent enactments (namely, Order No. 83/1997 of the Ministry of Finance (R-27); Order No. 1283/1998 of the Ministry of Finance (R-28); Order No. 105/1999 of the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection (R-29); and Government Decision No. 1461/1996 (R-30)). R-PHB, paras. 273-74.\n\nR-PHB, paras. 340-44.\n\n*Id.* para. 348 (R-20).\n\n*Id.* para. 363; Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001 by the Romanian Prime Minister (R-26; C-34).\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal's Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n188.\n\nIn examining the alleged breaches by the Respondent of its obligations under the BIT, the Tribunal will not dwell on the manner SOF has performed its obligations under the Share Purchase Contract. Under Article 10.1(c) of the Share Purchase Contract, SOF had diligently to support the Claimants in the rescheduling of Socomet's outstanding debts and the cancelling of its penalties and additional payments for delay to CONEL and ROMGAZ. SOF requested this rescheduling from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on 28 May 1999 and supported Socomet's request to CONEL and ROMGAZ. It therefore performed its contractual obligations. However, as indicated above, the performance by SOF of its contractual obligations under the Share Purchase Contract is not within the jurisdiction *ratione materiae* of the Tribunal.\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore only examine whether the Respondent, through its respective State entities, has breached its obligation to grant the Claimants' investment fair and equitable treatment under Article 2(3) of the BIT. The Claimants, of course, bear the legal burden of proving any breach.\n\n190.\n\nIn assessing this matter, the Tribunal must first examine the importance of debt rescheduling for Socomet.\n\n191.\n\nIn 1999, Socomet was heavily indebted to Romania and to various organs of the Romanian State. The success of the Claimants' investment in Socomet depended on the rescheduling of these debts and upon the waiver of the related penalties. Under Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, Socomet's debts to the *\u2018State Budget, Budget for Social Assurances, Health Budget, including credits from the Ministry of Finance for paying the power and gas supply, had to be rescheduled within 5 years with a 2 year grace period and all related penalties and additional payments for delay had to be cancelled.\"*\n\n192.\n\nConsequently, the Claimants agreed to pay USD 517,020 for 70% of the shares in Socomet and to invest an additional USD 20 million within 5 years on the condition that the respective Romanian governmental entities would reschedule Socomet's debts towards them and would waive penalties and delay payments as provided by Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract. Were this condition not met, the Claimants were entitled to terminate the contract and receive reimbursement for sums already paid towards the purchase price.\n\n193.\n\nOn 17 May 1999, well within the 40 days after the signature of the Share Purchase Contract, the Romanian Prime Minister, on the request of the Minister of Finance, the Minister of Labor and Social Protection, and the Minister of Health, referred to the rescheduling condition of the Share Purchase Contract and approved the restructuring of:\n\n*\"the debts of S.C. SOCOMET S.A. Otelu Rosu that are overdue and unpaid* *on time to the State Budget, the Social Insurance Budget, the Health Budget* *and Special Funds, over a period of 5 years, with a grace period of 2 years. Subsequently, the payments shall be done as follows: 10% in the third year,* *30% in the fourth year and 60% in the last year, as well as the cancellation* *of all related penalties and/or delay penalties.\"*211\n\n*See supra* para. 54.\n\n194.\n\nThe exact amount of the debts to be rescheduled or waived was to be verified by DGFPCFS Caras Severin, the regional administration.\n\n195.\n\nIn this Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, which bore the official stamp of the Prime Minister, the head of the Romanian Government, and three of his Ministers, acknowledged that they were familiar with the Share Purchase Contract, and that they were aware of the fact that the requested rescheduling and waivers were, for the Claimants, a preliminary condition for the purchase of the Socomet shares, for the assumption of the direction of Socomet, and for the additional investment of USD 20 million into Socomet's further operations. Aware of this fact, the signatories of the Government's Note confirmed that the Claimants could cancel the Share Purchase Contract if this rescheduling was not granted within 40 days after the signature of the contract. Consequently, as provided under Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract, the Government's Note No. 5/3228, issued within the contractual 40 days after the signature of the contract, would rightly be considered as a formal grant of the required scheduling. It is, therefore, evidence that the rescheduling and waiver, as required under Article 10 of the Share Purchase Contract, had been obtained within the envisaged timeframe.\n\n196.\n\nIndeed, SOF, a specialized governmental institution in charge of privatizations, understood the Government's Note No. 5/3228 to be exactly such a grant by the highest State authorities, of the rescheduling and waivers as provided for by Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract. SOF invoked this grant in its request of 28 May 1999 to the Romanian Ministry of Industry and Commerce to reschedule Socomet's energy debts. For the purposes of the present case, it is particularly crucial to note that SOF also confirmed to the Claimants on 3 June 1999 that all the conditions imposed by Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, including the rescheduling of Socomet's debts to the State Budget, the Social Insurance Budget, the Health Budget and Special Funds and cancellation of the related penalties, had been met.212\n\n*See supra* para. 52.\n\n197.\n\nShortly after having been informed that the Government had approved the rescheduling and waivers, as provided for by the Share Purchase Contract, the Claimants paid the second and final part of the share purchase price (USD 297,184), joined the Board of Directors of Socomet, and created Gavazzi Steel Consultants to develop Socomet's international business.\n\n198.\n\nThe Tribunal decides the merits by majority vote. It agrees with the Claimants that, by the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, four Ministers of the Romanian Government, including its Prime Minister, granted and approved the rescheduling and waivers as required by the Share Purchase Contract. They justifiably considered this Government's Note as such - subject to further implementation of this rescheduling and waiver by the administrations concerned.\n\n199.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot, as the Respondent does, reduce the Government's Note No. 5/3228 to a mere internal communication to different administrative addressees of the Prime Minister's approval of some rescheduling and waivers, to the extent allowed by other legal provisions. The four Ministers who signed the Government's Note were well aware that the rescheduling and waivers were the preliminary condition of the Claimants' investment in Socomet. They were also well aware that the Government's Note would be notified to the Claimants, and would be considered by them the actual grant of the rescheduling and waiver, as required by the Share Purchase Contract.\n\n200.\n\nMost importantly, the Tribunal observes that the Respondent in fact has never implemented the rescheduling and waivers granted in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.\n\n201.\n\nIndeed, on 19 October 1999 the Romanian Ministry of Finance formally affected to implement the rescheduling granted in the Government's Note of 17 May 1999 but in fact proposed less favorable terms. The grace period was shortened from two years to 5.5 months.213 A substantial part of the penalties was not cancelled as the Government's Note No. 5/3228 had indicated but was only rescheduled (with an interest rate of 36%). Furthermore, the rescheduling was subordinated to Socomet's payment of current obligations to the State Budget and to Socomet's establishment of a bank guarantee for rescheduled payments - conditions not at all mentioned in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 and which the Claimants could not fulfill because of lack of funds. Moreover, in fact the partial rescheduling, proposed by the Ministry of Finance in October 1999, was never carried out.\n\nThe argument that the applicable law allowed only for a grace period of a maximum of 6 months does not convince the Tribunal. The Government's Note No. 5/3228 explicitly granted a grace period of 2 years and did not submit the modalities of the rescheduling to legal restrictions. The Government's Note No. 5/3228 thus created legitimate expectations for the Claimants.\n\n202.\n\nFor many months, the other Ministries involved in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 did not even implement any rescheduling or waiver.\n\n203.\n\nOn 19 July 2001, a Government decision by the Prime Minister, countersigned by the Minister of Finance and Minister of Labor and Social Solidarity, provided for a rescheduling of some - not all - of the debts that were covered by the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.214 Moreover, the rescheduling scheme that this Government Decision envisaged was less favourable than the scheme of the Government's Note, among other reasons because the grace period was reduced again from 2 years to 6 months. The 2001 rescheduling scheme likewise was never carried out.\n\n*See supra* para. 68.\n\n204.\n\nThe Claimants correctly understood the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 as the grant of the rescheduling and waivers, foreseen in the Share Purchase Contract. They reasonably relied upon the Note and were justified in expecting that the rescheduling and waiver would be implemented within a short time, as outlined by the Government's Note. The issuance of the Government's Note No. 5/3228 thus induced the payment of the second and final part of the share price, as well as the membership of the Claimants of the Board of Directors and management of Socomet, and the Claimants' investment in Socomet's operations.\n\n205.\n\nIn fact, the rescheduling and waiver, envisaged by the Government's Note No. 5/3228, were never carried out by the Romanian Government, its Ministries and lower administrations, whose acts and omissions are attributable to the Respondent under international law. Consequently, by failing to implement the rescheduling and waivers granted in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, the Respondent obstructed the legitimate expectations of the Claimants and has not treated them in a fair and equitable manner as required by Article 2(3) of the BIT.\n\n206.\n\nDue to the fact that the public debts were not rescheduled or waived as promised in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, Socomet had to use its funds to pay these debts and Socomet became deprived of funds to finance its operations. When these debts were not paid, Socomet's Romanian bank accounts were frozen and Socomet could no longer finance its operations and further investments. Instances in which this happened included the freezing of Socomet's accounts by the Romanian Ministry of Finance in the autumn of 1999, and the blockage of Socomet's accounts by Caras Severin Labour in April 2000.\n\n207.\n\nIn August 2002 this situation ultimately resulted in Socomet's insolvency, by which the Claimants lost all the funds they had invested in the Socomet operations. The Tribunal concludes that the facts, as related above, which ultimately led to Socomet's insolvency, constitute a breach by the Respondent of the Fair and Equitable Standard, contained in Article 2(3) of the BIT. The heads of damages and the quantification of the damages, caused by this breach, will be discussed in the quantum phase of these proceedings.\n\n*b)*  *Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT*\n---------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nArticle 4(1) and (2) of the BIT provides:\n\n*(1) The investments to which this Agreement relates shall not be subject to any measure which might limit permanently or temporarily their joined rights of ownership, possession, control or enjoyment, except where specifically provided by law by judgments or orders issued by Courts or Tribunals having jurisdiction.*\n\n*(2) Investments made by investors of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party shall not be expropriated, nationalized, requisitioned or subjected to other measures having directly or indirectly similar effect (all of these* *measures hereinafter referred to as \"expropriation\"), unless the following* *conditions are fulfilled:*\n\n*a) the measures are adopted in the national interest, or for public purposes and in accordance with due process of law;*\n\n*b) the measures are not discriminatory, compared to the measures taken against national investments and investors or against the investments and investors of third countries;*\n\n*c) a proper procedure is established to determine the amount and method of payment of compensation.215*\n\nBIT, Art. 4(1)-(2) (English text) (C-4).\n\n*(i) The Parties' Contentions*\n------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nThe Claimants assert that the Respondent's failure to effect the Restructuring of the Company's Debt, in conflict with the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, led to forced cash withdrawals in favor of the Government creditors and to the blocking of the Company's bank accounts, which limited the Company's potential for investments, frustrated i.a. a new investment by Techint and ultimately led to Socomet's insolvency, depriving the Claimants of all their investments in the Socomet project.216 After the insolvency, AVAS had the Company valued at USD 22 million217 and subsequently sold it to other investors.218\n\nC-Request, para. 124; C-PHB, para. 89.\n\nThe Claimants refer to the \"Plan of Judicial Reorganising of the Company S.C. Gavazzi Steel S.A. Otelu Rosu,\" prepared by Iprolam S.A., Institute for Designing Rolling Sections and Plants, Bucharest (C-57; R-52), which, according to the Claimants, in 2004 ascribed to the Company, *inter alia*, a liquidation value of USD 22 million. C-PHB, para. 92 n.120.\n\nIn support, the Claimants rely on the hearing testimony of Mr. Florin Frumosu, a former member of the Board of Directors of Gavazzi Steel S.A. and the Company's Director General from May until July 2002, who stated that the Company and/or its assets were sold first to another Italian investor and subsequently to a Russian investor.\n\n210.\n\nThe Claimants allege that the Respondent breached its obligations under Article 4 of the BIT in three different manners. First, by blocking the Company's bank accounts, the Respondent subjected the Claimants, in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT, to a \" *measure which might limit permanently or temporarily their joined rights of ownership, possession, control or enjoyment*,\" which was not \" *specifically provided by law* \" or \" *judgments*.\"219 Second, (i) by not implementing the Restructuring of the Company's Debt; (ii) by blocking, and forcing withdrawals from, the Company's bank accounts; and (iii) by forcing the Company into insolvency, the Respondent subjected the Claimants to \" *measures having directly or indirectly similar effect [to expropriation, nationalization, or requisition]*,\" which deprived them of their investment in breach of Article 4(2) of the BIT.220 Third, by not implementing the 2007 Romanian Award and having a Romanian court instead decide on the merits of the dispute, the Respondent did not respect the \" *proper procedure [for] determin[ing] the amount and method of payment of compensation,* \" breaching, according to the Claimants, Article 4(2)(c) of the BIT.221\n\nC-Request, para. 126; C-PHB, para. 90.\n\nC-Request, para. 127; C-PHB, para. 91.\n\nC-Request, para. 128.\n\n211.\n\nThe Respondent, however, alleges that the Claimants themselves triggered the insolvency of Socomet in three different ways. First, Socomet (by now the Company was called Gavazzi Steel) controlled by the Claimants, forfeited the debt rescheduling and waiver, which had been granted on condition of such payment, by failing to fulfill some payments, thus leading to the blocking of the Company's bank accounts. Second, the Claimants failed to make the necessary investments as provided for in the Share Purchase Contract, which was a condition for the rescheduling and waiver. Third, Claimants' general mismanagement of the Company inevitably led to the insolvency of Socomet.\n\n*(1) Non-payment of Overdue Debts to the State Budget*\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that the Company failed to comply with the conditions for the debt rescheduling as set forth in the Ministry of Finance's letter of 19 October 1999, which, for instance, still required payment of the Company's outstanding debts to the State Budget.\"222 Thus, the Respondent contends that in February 2002, the General Directorate of Public Finance had to attach cash deposits on Gavazzi's Steel's bank accounts in order to cover these debts.223\n\nIn support, the Respondent relies on \"computation notes\" and \"computation minutes\" prepared by the General Directorate of Public Finance of Caras-Severin County in 2002 (R-PO/CM/CC, paras. 258-59). The Claimants point out that the \"computation notes\" did not concern current payments due by the Company but rather the debts that should have been first suspended and thereafter rescheduled under the Ministry of Finance's letter of 19 October 1999 (C-PHB, paras. 67-69).\n\nR-PO/CM/CC, paras. 260-63; two notices of garnishment dated 25 February 2002 (R-34; R-35). As noted, the Respondent alleges that the previous freeze of the Company's bank accounts, which had occurred in September 1999, was lifted on 6 December 1999. The Respondent asserts that the Company never challenged those garnishments, even though it could have done so under Government Ordinance No. 11/1996 on the Enforcement of Budget Debts.\n\n213.\n\nFor the Claimants, the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 did not require payment of outstanding debts to the State Budget. The blocking of the bank accounts in February 2002 confirms that the broad rescheduling and waivers, granted in the Government's Note No. 5/3228, were never implemented. Even the less favorable rescheduling proposals of 19 October 1999 by the Ministry of Finance, or by the Government's Decision No. 692 of 19 July 2001, were never implemented.\n\n*(2) Lack of Investments*\n-------------------------\n\n214.\n\nArticle 8.10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract provides:\n\n*Buyer commits himself to effect in the Company either by own sources and provided [i]n his name or by a third Party he attracted, within a period of maximum 5 (five) years starting with the Payment Date, investment / contribution to capital as provided by law, in a total value of 20,000,000 USD (out of which the environmental investments represent 480,000 USD), scheduled according to Annex No.6.*224\n\nShare Purchase Contract, Article 8.10.1(a) (C-19) (emphasis omitted). *See supra* para. 45.\n\n215.\n\nArticle 8.10.1 was amended by the Addendum of 7 July 2000, postponing the start of the 5 year investment period to June 2000:\n\n*Purchaser undertakes to bring in the company out of his own sources, brought on its name, or by a third party, brought by the purchaser, for a period of maximum 5 (five) years, commencing on 24.06.2000 investment/capital contributions, in the forms provided by law, in a total amount of 20,000,000 US$.*225\n\nAddendum no. 2/07.07.2000 to Share Purchase Contract No. 145/19.04.1999, Article 1 (C-20). *See supra* para. 46.\n\n216.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimants failed to make the investments in the Company as required by the Share Purchase Contract. This failure, so the Respondent maintains, was another direct cause of the Company's insolvency and eventual insolvency and liquidation.226\n\nR-PHB, para. 237 *et seq.* Article 8.10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, the Claimants undertook to make investments or contributions in the Company totaling USD 20,000,000 within five years \"starting with the Payment Date.\" In Addendum No. 2 to the Share Purchase Contract, the parties agreed that that five-year period would run from 24 June 2000 (*see supra* paras. 46 and 215); thus, under the Share Purchase Contract, as amended, the Claimants were to make the total investment/contribution of USD 20,000,000 by June 2005, the first installment totaling USD 2,000,000 being due by the end of June 2001. In response to a request by the Claimants that the deadline for the first installment be extended by six months to the end of 2001, APAPS replied:  \n*According to [the Share Purchase Contract], you are not supposed to certify to A.P.A.P.S.* *... that the investments made each year have been included in the company's social capital.* *It is expressively [sic] indicated that this obligation is to be carried out only at the end of the 5 years period of time, after the complete fulfillment of the investment programme....*  *In conclusion, we consider it is not necessary the time being to sign an Amendment [to the Share Purchase Contract] in order to lengthen the first investment year until 31st of December 2001....*  \n Letter from APAPS to Stefano Gavazzi, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Gavazzi Steel S.A. June 2001 (translated from Romanian into English) (C-70).\n\n217.\n\nThe Parties have discussed at length the extent to which the Claimants were obliged to make investments in the Socomet project under the Share Purchase Contract and the extent to which the investments were actually made.\n\n218.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that, under Romanian law, an investment in a company requires participation in its capital through the exchange of shares. Financing a company without increasing its registered capital would not be considered an investment. The Respondent points out that, pursuant to Article 8.10.2 of the Share Purchase Contract, the capital investment would only be considered achieved on the date of registration of the nominal capital increase with the Trade Register Office.227 The Claimants, however, counter that the funds that Messrs. Marco and Stefano Gavazzi provided to cover the various needs of the Company between 1999 and 2002 qualified as an investment and had only to be converted and registered as capital increase by June 2005, the deadline established under Article 8.10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, as amended.228\n\nArticle Art. 8.10.2 of the Share Purchase Contract provides:  \n*The capital investment shall be considered fully achieved on the date of registration with the Trade Register Office of*  ***Company***  *of the nominal capital increase with their counter value or, as the case may be with the cash subscribed and fully paid capital, made by the*  ***Buyer***  *or a third Party he attracted.*  \n Share Purchase Contract, Art. 8.10.2 (C-19).\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the Respondent has acknowledged that, \" *prior to the initiation of the Lalive* *Arbitration, the Claimants made an increase of the Company share capital [] by USD 2,000,000 by converting the Company's debts towards Holdeast S.p.A., owned by the Claimants, into shares.* \" The Respondent adds, however, that \" *there is no evidence to prove the recording of this increase with the Trade Registry* \" (R-PHB, para. 156).\n\n219.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Article 8.10.2 indeed requires that the capital investment be made by capital increase, and that such capital increase had to be registered with the Trade Register Office, but (by a majority) that the capital increase did not have to occur before June 2005.\n\n220.\n\nHowever, independent of the issue of whether registration for a capital increase was required when the investment was made or later, by June 2005, the Parties disagree on whether specific operations by the Claimants by their nature could be considered as \"investments.\" For instance, the Respondent argues that neither the injection of the Claimants' personal funds into the Company as a loan, nor the conversion of the Company's debts into loans, should be given the status of investments.229\n\nThe Claimants allege that funds in the amounts of USD l,265,000 and \u20ac 438,000 had already been duly registered in the accounts of the company (C-RPHB, para. 11; C-RL/OJ/A/CC, para. 88). In support of this argument, the Claimants rely on a document entitled \"Situation of Loans Made by Mr. Gavazzi, Entered in the Book-Keeping Records of SC Gavazzi Steel S.A.,\" signed by the Company's Economic Director and by an official of its Chief Bookkeeping Department (C-61, translated from Romanian into English).  \n For instance, the Claimants considered a conversion of a debt that Socomet S.A. owed Holdeast SRL, an Italian company wholly owned by the Claimants, to be an investment of USD 1,490,255. However, for the Respondent, this conversion cannot be considered an investment due under the Share Purchase Contract, because this conversion was discussed only after December 2001, the deadline for providing the first portion (totaling USD 2,000,000) of the contractually required USD 20,000,000 investment (R-PHB, para. 244). That debt resulted from the liquidation of Easteel, which was being performed by a Resita court (Minutes of a meeting of the Board of Directors Gavazzi Steel S.A. held on 1 February 2002; C-36).  \n The Shareholders' Meeting of 30 April 2002 decided that the corresponding increase of the Company assets should be registered as capital with the Trade Register (C-RPHB, para. 11; Minutes of the General Meeting of the Company's Shareholders, 30 Apr. 2002 (C-25)). The Claimants point out that the Respondent itself admitted that this conversion took place and even indicates an amount of the full USD 2,000,000 (C-RPHB, para. 12). The Respondent contends that, however, the conversion of this debt into shares was not recorded with the Trade Registry (R-PHB, para 156 n.44).\n\n221.\n\nIn this connection, for the Respondent \"it is important to determine the juridical nature of each sum of money introduced in [the Company] pursuant to the domestic (Romanian) legislation.\"230 Thus, the Respondent contends, the distinction under Romanian law between \"investment\" and \"financing\" must be respected. According to the Respondent, the amounts that the Claimants allegedly \"used for SOCOMET's establishment - namely amounts paid directly to the Company or paid to third parties [on] its behalf\" - do not represent investments but, rather, \"financing\" because they \"confer[] the right to interest payments.\"231\n\nR-PHB, para. 144.\n\n*Id.* paras. 155, 247, 255.\n\n222.\n\nIn sum, the Respondent concludes that there is no evidence that the Claimants \"invested\" in the Company, either directly or through Gavazzi Steel Consultants. Specifically, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have provided no documentary evidence supporting their allegations, such as bank documentation and other documents showing that the amounts alleged by the Claimants \"were paid within the Company's accounts as investments.\"232 For the Respondent, the witness testimonies and the minutes of meetings of the Board of Directors and shareholders of the Company proffered by the Claimants, suggesting investments, represent \" *pro causa* evidence.\"\n\n*Id.* paras. 157, 249.\n\n223.\n\nThe Claimants, on the other hand, refer to their negotiations with Kinglor, Techint, Simest and Hypo Vereinsbank to introduce new \"Consteel\" technology operations, in order to revitalize the Company's outdated plant and production and to introduce Techint to join Gavazzi Steel as a new major shareholder. This operation, which would have involved an additional investment of some USD 20,000,000, was ultimately not realized because Gavazzi Steel's bank accounts remained blocked. For the Respondent, however, the Claimants did not submit any convincing proof that this potential investment project would ever have materialized - the potential project can, in no events, be considered an actual investment.233\n\n*See* R-PHB, paras. 262-68; R-RPHB, paras. 56-57; C-RPHB, para. 36; C-RL/OJ/A/CC, paras. 91-94; Hypo VereinsBank Financial Offer, 7 Sept. 2001 (C-51); outline/draft of a share purchase option agreement between Techint and Gavazzi (C-52); draft letter of intent between Techint and Gavazzi, Nov. 2001 (C-53); Gavazzi Steel S.A. \"Business Plan for an Investment Project in Rumania,\" June 2002 (C-54); \"Master Plan Regarding the improvement of the Steel-plant department (from scrap yard to two continuous casting machines) - Application of the Consteel technology,\" prepared by Kinglor Ltd. for Gavazzi Steel S.A., Apr. 2002 (C-55); document described by the Claimants as the Technical Offer by Techint, 12 June 2001 (C-68); document titled \"Details of Investments,\" prepared by Kinglor SRL (C-69); Raimondo di Carpegna Varini witness statement (CW5); Betto Stendardi witness statement (CW6); hearing testimony of Raimondo di Carpegna Varini (Hearing Transcript, 4 June 2014, at 535-46); hearing testimony of Betto Stendardi (Hearing Transcript, 4 June 2014, at 547-52).\n\n224.\n\nFinally, the Respondent observes that the Claimants did not respect their investment obligations under Annex No. 6 of the Share Purchase Contract, even as amended by the Addendum of 7 July 2000. Amended Annex No. 6 provides that USD 2,000,000 would have to be invested during the period 24 June 2000 - 23 June 2001 with the following \"Investment objectives\": \"Oxygen factory,\" \"Cooling water station Constructions,\" \"Transformation post.\" It further provides that USD 4,000,000 would have to be invested during the period 24 June 2001-23 June 2002 with the following \"Investment objectives\": \"Stoves and accessories.\"234 No evidence has been submitted that the Claimants invested in these specific items within the imposed timeframe of June 2000 to June 2002.\n\n*See supra* para 46.\n\n*(3) General Mismanagement*\n---------------------------\n\n225.\n\nFor the Respondent, the main cause of Socomet's insolvency was the Claimants' faulty management of the Company from July 1999 onwards.235\n\nR-PHB, para. 138 *et seq.*\n\n226.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Socomet was profitable before the Claimants took over the Company but became insolvent under the Claimants' management. Socomet's 31 December 1998 balance sheet shows that the Company was not in financial difficulties in July 1999, as the Claimants allege.236\n\n*Id.* paras. 162-64; Ministry of Finance, Balance Sheet Forms on 31 Dec. 1998, Socomet S.A. (R-135).\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimants contend that Socomet had made no profit in 1998; the nominal profit of Lei 1,315 billion (equaling some USD 70,000), as entered on the 31 December 1998 balance sheet, must be considered against the massive Lei 115,486 billion in \"[d]ebt-related penalties not included in the balance sheet.\"237 As Claimant Mr. Marco Gavazzi testified at the hearing, after he and his brother joined the Board of Directors of the Company, they discovered that the indication of a profit on the 31 December 1998 balance sheet was \"false.\"238 The Respondent submits that the Claimants, as Directors of the Company, did not take any judicial action against those responsible for the alleged irregularities in the balance sheet and, thus, had \"tacitly assumed responsibility and liability for the financial situation of the Company.\"239\n\nC-RPHB, para. 34; Statement of Socomet's General Manager annexed to the 7 July 2000 Addendum No. 2 to the Share Purchase Contract (R-14).\n\nHearing testimony of Marco Gavazzi (Hearing Transcript, 3 June 2014, at 361).\n\nR-PHB, paras. 164-67, 208-209.\n\n228.\n\nTo prove the Claimants' mismanagement, the Respondent refers to the Minutes of the Board of Directors of the Company between July 1999 and August 2002, which show that, in that period, the Company did not pay its current debts to the State Budget and to its suppliers, that loans were not used for business purposes, that workers' salaries were not paid (which led to strikes), that revenues from export operations were not transferred to the Company's accounts (but to Gavazzi Steel Consultants), that the Company ceased production, and that the Company's equipment was stolen.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimants contend that they created a Virgin Islands offshore company, Gavazzi Steel Consultants, to develop Gavazzi Steel's international business, to employ and pay Italian steel engineers for operating and modernizing the factory,240 to collect purchase orders from foreign clients, and, generally, to assist the Claimants in managing the Company.241 The Respondent, however, is of the opinion that Gavazzi Steel Consultants was not necessary for the operations of Gavazzi Steel and that its real purpose was to benefit from the tax advantages of the Virgin Islands by, *inter alia*, obliging the Company to pay Gavazzi Steel Consultants a 3% commission on obtained orders, thus depriving the Company of necessary funds.242\n\nThe Claimants contend that Socomet could not employ those technicians directly due to restrictive Romanian legislation and the fact that the Italian steel engineers did not agree to their salaries being paid in Lei (C-RPHB, para. 30).\n\n*See supra* para. 56. The Claimants assert that they announced, at their first meeting of the Board of Directors on 9 July 1999, the creation of Gavazzi Steel Consultants in order to advise \"SOCOMET in sales and marketing matters and in obtaining production orders...[Gavazzi Steel Consultants] would be based on the technical and professional skills of top firms and sales professionals that prefer to work with Western companies and who would be in charge with European and Mediterranean markets.\" (\"Minutes of the Board of Directors of S.C. Socomet S.A.,\" 9 July 1999 (C-36) (C-RPHB, para. 30)). At the same meeting, the Claimants continue, Mr. Marco Gavazzi announced his intention \"to transfer the shares of the new company to SOCOMET SA, in a ratio of 100%, a percentage that would avoid future misunderstandings with the Romanian tax authorities\" and conflicts of interest (C-RPHB, para. 30).\n\nR-PHB, paras. 181-184, 193-194; Commercial Agency Contract between Gavazzi Steel S.A. and Gavazzi Steel Consultants B.V., 25 Aug. 1999 (C-65). The Respondent alleges that the Claimants did not inform the other members of the Board of Directors of Gavazzi Steel S.A. of the existence and role of Gavazzi Steel Consultants, or of the conflict of interest between the two companies.\n\n230.\n\nThe Respondent stresses that it never approved the creation of Gavazzi Steel Consultants. The permission from the Romanian Central Bank to allow Socomet to transfer USD 100,000 for the acquisition of Gavazzi Steel Consultants is, for the Respondent, no proof that the Respondent considered Gavazzi Steel Consultants to be an investment under the Share Purchase Contract.243\n\nR-PHB, paras. 174-80.\n\n231.\n\nActually, as the Claimants point out, the Company lacked the necessary funds to pay these USD 100,000, and the Claimants intended only to transfer GBP 1,000, the amount equal to the nominal capital of Gavazzi Steel Consultants. As the Company in fact never paid this amount, Gavazzi Steel Consultants remained fully owned by the Claimants.244 Moreover, the Company never paid any commission to Gavazzi Steel Consultants, and the salaries of the Italian engineers, totaling USD 500,000.36, were entirely paid by the Claimants.245\n\nC-RPHB, para. 30. In support, the Claimants rely on Minutes of meetings of Socomet's Board of Directors held on 14 September and 16 November 1999 (C-36).\n\nIn support, the Claimants rely on a statement dated 26 September 2002 by Banca Commerciale Lugano (Switzerland) (C-62) and on an internal Gavazzi Steel Consultants memorandum (\"Pro-Memoria\") dated 26 Dec. 1999 (C-63).  \nIn this context, three Italian former employees sued Claimant Marco Gavazzi before the labor court in Como, Italy for payment of unpaid salaries. This labor dispute, the Respondent contends, resulted in a decision by the Como court on 4 September 2001, ordering Marco Gavazzi to pay three months' salaries to the employees. The decision of the Como court was confirmed by the Cassation Court in Rome on 6 April 2006 (R-PHB, paras. 186-87).\n\n232.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent continues, on 5 December 2001, Gavazzi Steel authorized the company Mi & Cor Comaltex S.R.L. (\"Mi & Cor\"), its exclusive sales agent for the domestic market, to mortgage the Company's assets to obtain loans and to incur new debt,246 as arbitrator Dr. Drago\u00a7-Alexandru Sitaru confirmed in his dissenting opinion to the 2007 Romanian Award.247 As another example of mismanagement on the part of the Claimants, the Respondent refers to the imprudence of Mr. Stefano Gavazzi in signing a blank check, which was subsequently filled out for an exorbitant amount and refused by the bank.248\n\nR-PHB, paras. 158-60.\n\n*Autoritatea pentru Valorificarea Activelor Statulul v. Marco Gavazzi et al.*, Court of International Commercial Arbitration Attached to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Romania, Case No. 743/2002, Dissenting Opinion of Dragos-Ale\\andru Sitaru (30 Oct. 2007) (R-3).\n\nIn May 2002, Claimant Stefano Gavazzi left a signed blank check in the Company's safe, to be used in case of emergency while he was in Italy undergoing surgery. This check was abusively filled out in the amount of Lei 9,999,999,999 [at that time the equivalent of some \u20ac 333,000] by the Company's Director General (who was subsequently dismissed), triggering Socomet's insolvency (hearing testimony of Claimant Marco Gavazzi; Hearing Transcript, 3 June 2014, at 425). The check later wound up in the hands of Mi & Cor, which, according to the Claimants, used it to blackmail Gavazzi Steel S.A. (C-RPHB, para. 32; hearing testimony of Florin Frumosu (HearingTranscript, 4 June 2014, at 586-587)), before finally presenting it to the Romanian Commercial Bank. Payment on the check was refused and Claimant Stefano Gavazzi was charged for, among other things, embezzlement, forgery, fraud, and \"crimes related to companies.\" He was later acquitted. (Criminal File No. 0048/01; 0049/01 (R-49, translated from Romanian into English)).\n\n233.\n\nFor the Respondent, the Claimants' mismanagement was also illustrated in the letter of 8 January 2001, by which Gavazzi Steel's General Manager requested the Romanian Minister of Finance to investigate the Company's privatization - which the General Manager termed \"fraudulent\" - and its economic results.249 In his letter, the General Manager complained that (i) the investments of USD 2,000,000, due for the period 1 June 1999 - 1 June 2000, had not been made; (ii) that the Company's debts had increased from Lei 321,636,058,000 as of 31 July 1999 to Lei 483,518,635,860 on 31 November 2000; (iii) that the Company's assets had been \"decimated\" through \"asset sales\" and \"massive scrapping and dismantling of equipment\"; (iv) that the production of \"electro-steel and rolled products\" had decreased; (v) that exports had decreased significantly; (vi) that the Company had embezzled the compensation paid by the Romanian State for laying off 500 employees by hiring outside staff at the same level with the lay-offs, thereby practically \"annulling\" the effects of the lay-offs; (vi) that employee salaries had not been paid in time, resulting in strikes; and (vii) that Claimant Stefano Gavazzi, contrary to assurances he had given, \"left the company\" on December 22, 2000 for the winter holidays in Italy, \"leaving it without electricity and pit gas.\"250\n\nR-PHB, para. 194 *et seq.* & letter dated 8 Jan. 2001 from Margan Ion, General Manager of Gavazzi Steel S.A., to the Romanian Minister of Industry and Resources (R-44, translated from Romanian into English).\n\nIn his letter, the General Manager also states the following:  \n*[T]he [described] illegalities... (including the privatization) have occurred after my* *dismissal on 8.02.1999 from the position of GENERAL MANAGER of SC SOCOMET SA, for political reasons... by the former [SOF] manager... and my replacement with a person who was a PNTCD member. After my dismissal, I was forced to retire starting with* *01.06.1999, and on May 17, 2000 I was re-assigned as DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER, and starting with 01.12.2000, appointed GENERAL MANAGER of SC GAVAZZI STEEL SA.*  \n Letter dated 8 January 2001 from Margan Ion, General Manager of Gavazzi Steel S.A., to the Romanian Minister of Industry and Resources (R-44, translated from Romanian into English).\n\n234.\n\nThe Respondent further refers to the conclusion of Iprolam S.A, the judicial liquidator of Gavazzi Steel, that \"[i]nefficient management\" had been one of the causes of the difficulties Gavazzi Steel had encountered.251\n\nR-PHB, para. 203 & Note regarding the Plan of judicial re-organization of Gavazzi Steel S.A., prepared by the judicial liquidator Iprolam S.A., Mar. 2004 (R-52, translated from Romanian into English).\n\n235.\n\nThe Respondent concludes, therefore, that because of the Claimants' mismanagement, the value of the Company's net assets decreased from Lei 68,056,056,000 in 1998 to Lei 44,894,261,000 in 2002, receivables were not collected, and the Company's debts increased threefold between the end of 1998 and the end of 2002.252\n\nR-PHB, para. 161.\n\n*(ii) The Tribunal's Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that the Company's insolvency was triggered by its failure to pay the increases for overdue debts to the State budget and by the blocking of its bank accounts, which resulted from this failure. However, neither Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract, nor the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 mentioned that overdue debts would remain payable by the Company. On the contrary, they granted a general waiver of \"the Company's debts to State Budget, Budget for Social Assurances, Health Budget, including credits got from the Ministry of Finances for paying the power and natural gas supply,\" as well as the \"cancellation of all related penalties and/or delay penalties.\" In fact, the blocking of the Company's bank accounts, as well as the diversion of its funds to occasional payment of these debts (instead of investments and operations of the plant), were precisely caused by the Respondent's failure to implement its obligations assumed in the Government's Note No. 5/3228. The Respondent is not entitled to argue that the Claimants caused the non-implementation of the rescheduling and waivers and thus its own insolvency because of the failure promptly to pay \"increases for overdue debts to the State budget,\"253 since the rescheduling and waivers, to which the Respondent committed itself, included these debts.\n\nR-PHB, para. 293.\n\n237.\n\nThe argument that the Company's failure and subsequent insolvency was due to insufficient investments has been discussed by the Parties in great detail as to whether investments were made by the Claimants and, if so, which investments were made. However, the Tribunal is conscious that the debts, which had to be rescheduled or waived under Article 10.1 of the Share Purchase Contract and the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, have actually not been waived or rescheduled. The Respondent argued that the Claimants have not exercised their right to cancel the Contract as a result of the rescheduling or waivers not being granted within 40 days of the signature of the Contract, but the rescheduling and waivers remained a preliminary condition for the Claimants' performance of their investment obligations even if the contract had not been cancelled. The Government's Note No. 5/3228 expressly mentions that the rescheduling and waivers were a condition for these investments.\n\n238.\n\nConsequently, the Claimants were entitled to suspend investments they were obliged to make under the Contract, as long as they had not obtained the rescheduling and waivers under the conditions granted in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999. The Tribunal agrees with the findings in the 2007 Romanian Award that the failure to reschedule and/or waive the public debts as provided for by the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 was \"fundamental, enduring and paralyzing,\" and that the Claimants' lack of investments was therefore \"logically and chronologically subsequent and secondary in importance.\"254\n\n2007 Romanian Award, at 18 (C-6).\n\n239.\n\nThe insolvency was not, as the Respondent alleges, entirely or partially triggered by the lack of investments required under the Share Purchase Contract. On the contrary, the Respondent's own failure effectively to reschedule and waive the debts as provided in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 ensured that these investment could not be carried out.\n\n240.\n\nThe Tribunal by majority concludes that the Respondent's acts and omissions following the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, without justified legal basis, solely and exclusively limited the Claimants' right of possession, control, and enjoyment of the funds they invested in the Company, in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT. These investments have been subjected to measures having directly or indirectly similar effect as an expropriation in breach of Article 4(2) of the BIT, whereby the measures, in view of Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999, were not adopted in accordance with due process of law. The Tribunal does not have to decide whether the measures are discriminatory (Article 4(2)(b) of the BIT) or whether a proper procedure was established to determine the amount and method of payment of compensation (Article 4(2)(c) of the BIT). Consequently, the Tribunal decides that, in the present case, the Respondent has breached Articles 4(1) and (2) of the BIT by its failure to reschedule and/or waive debts as set out in the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999.\n\n241.\n\nThe Tribunal emphasizes that the preceding paragraphs discussed the notion of \"investment\" in the light of the Claimants' contractual obligation to invest under the Share Purchase Contract. This issue has to be distinguished from the extent to which contributions that the Claimants have made to the Socomet project qualify as a \"protected investment\" under Article 1(b)/(d)/(f) of the BIT, which latter issue may have to be discussed further in the quantum phase of the present proceedings.\n\n242.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that various events occurred as to the Company in the four years after the Claimants acquired the majority of its shares. The Minutes of the meetings of the Board of Directors refer to even more incidents and difficulties than the ones raised by the Respondent. Indeed, the Claimants certainly also encountered fierce obstruction from the Company's workers, staff, and suppliers. The Tribunal will hear further submissions during the quantum phase of the proceedings on these difficulties and incidents as well as other matters, which may be attributable to factors for which the Respondent bears no legal responsibility under the BIT.\n\n**B. The Claimants' Additional, Subordinate Claim Under Article 2(5) of theBIT**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n*a)*  *The Claimants' Position*\n-------------------------------\n\n243.\n\nThe Claimants submit that, by its judiciary annulling the 2007 Romanian Award and rendering its decision of 16 March 2011, by the judgment of the Court of Appeals of Bucharest confirmed on 23 February 2012 by the Romanian Court of Cassation, the Respondent breached its duty to ensure to them \"effective means of asserting rights\" and \"enforcing rights\" with respect to their investment, thereby violating the Claimants' due process rights and committing a denial of justice, within the meaning of Article 2(5) of the BIT:\n\n*Each Contracting Party undertakes*  ***to provide effective means of*** ***asserting claims and enforcing rights***  *with respect to this present agreement, to the investment authorizations and properties. Each Contracting Party shall not impair the right of the investors of the other Contracting Party to have access to its Courts of justice, administrative Tribunals and agencies and all other bodies exercising adjudicatory authority.*255\n\nBIT, Art. 2(5) (English text) (C-4). (Emphasis added.)\n\n244.\n\nThe Court of Appeals annulled the 2007 Romanian Award on the ground that it \"breached the principle of equal treatment, the principle of observance of the right to defence and the principle of contradiction, which are public order principles.\"256\n\nBucharest Court of Appeals, Commercial Section A VI-A *(Curtea de Apel Bucuresti, Sectia A VI-A* *Comerciala),* Commercial Decision No. 65 (Case No. 8799/2/2007), at 11 (22 Apr. 2009) (C-38, translated from Romanian into English). *See supra* para. 79.\n\n245.\n\nThe Claimants contend that the Court of Appeals utterly misrepresented the record of the arbitral proceedings. In support of their contentions, the Claimants refer *inter alia* to the 2007 Romanian Award,257 to the procedural orders issued by the arbitral tribunal,258 to the minutes of the hearings held in Bucharest on 20 and 21 March 2001,259 to the Rules of Arbitration of the Court of International Commercial Arbitration attached to the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Romania and Bucharest,260 and to the expert testimony of Professor Sergiu Deleanu.261\n\nC-6; R-2.\n\n2002 Romanian Arbitration, Procedural Order No. 5, 10 Feb. 2006 (R-55); 2002 Romanian Arbitration, Procedural Order No. 6, 18 May 2006 (R-56).\n\nC-71 & C-72.\n\nC-76.\n\nLegal Opinion of Professor Sergiu Deleanu, School of Law, University \"Babes-Bolyai,\" Cluj-Napoca, Romania (2 Dec. 2013) (Ex. CEW-2); Hearing Transcript, 4 June 2014, at 588-660 (testimony of Sergiu Deleanu).\n\n246.\n\nTo counter the Respondent's argument that the arbitral tribunal should have appointed its own expert, instead of relying on the Claimants' expert (*see* below), the Claimants proffer that, in Romania, as elsewhere, international arbitral tribunals may rely on expert evidence provided by party-appointed experts and are not restricted to considering expert evidence provided by tribunal-appointed experts. To address Respondent's objection that, as Romanian courts would have to appoint their own court-expert, the arbitral tribunal should have done the same, the Claimants assert that, even if different rules may apply in Romanian domestic judicial courts, such domestic court practice is irrelevant for international commercial arbitration.\n\n247.\n\nThe Claimants further specify that the arbitral tribunal in the 2002 Romanian Arbitration actually afforded both sides the opportunity to present reports prepared by party-appointed experts: Gavazzi thus submitted the Deloitte & Touche report, whereas AVAS submitted an 2003 Auditing Report and the Iprolam Plan of Judicial Reorganization of Gavazzi Steel S.A. In addition, the Claimants aver, the arbitral tribunal, by unanimous decision, afforded both parties ample opportunity to comment on the admissibility, presentation, and content of the evidence. AVAS, however, did not avail itself of this possibility, nor did it make use of the possibility it had requested to hear its witnesses in Bucharest. Also, AVAS, according to the Claimants, did not challenge the minutes of the witnesses heard in Milan.\n\n248.\n\nAccording to the Claimants, all this evidence shows that both parties had ample opportunity to make their case and to submit evidence (AVAS itself produced an expert report on damages), and that the parties also had full opportunity to challenge the partial lack of video transmission and its replacement by written witness statements (which replacement was agreed to by the parties and the arbitral tribunal), if they so wished.262\n\nC-PHB, para. 101.\n\n249.\n\nThe Claimants contend that, in annulling the 2007 Romanian Award, the Court of Appeals manifestly breached Romanian law as well as UNCITRAL, ECHR, and general arbitration principles, which limit the grounds for the annulment of an award to serious departures from fundamental notions of public policy and procedural justice.263 Referring to the legal opinion of their expert witness on Romanian law, Professor Sergiu Deleanu, the Claimants assert that the arbitral tribunal had \"not breached the public policy of Romanian private international law, and that Romanian courts have wrongly assessed that a violation occurred in this respect..,.\"264 According to the Claimants, Romanian scholarly writing confirms that, under the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure, Romanian courts have to interpret very strictly the grounds for annulment of an arbitral award. Very few requests for annulment have ever been successful.265\n\nC-PHB, paras. 95, 105-10; C-Request, paras. 138-46.\n\nLegal Opinion of Professor Sergiu Deleanu, School of Law, University \"Babes-Bolyai,\" Cluj-Napoca, Romania (2 Dec. 2013) (CEW-2).\n\nC-PHB, paras 104-6. The Claimants quote from Crenguta Leaua, *Update on Romanian Jurisprudence on the* *Annulment of Arbitral Awards*, THE EUROPEAN AND MIDDLE EASTERN ARBITRATION REVIEW 2012 (published by Global Arbitration Review) 82, 84 (C-45). In this connection, the Claimants also rely, among other things, on the written legal opinion of Professor Sergiu Deleanu, who concludes that \"the application of [the] grounds for setting aside an arbitral award [] as made by the Court of Appeals of Bucharest and accepted by the High Court of Cassation and Justice in the AVAS-Gavazzi case are totally in contradiction with the consolidated European and Romanian jurisprudence on the matter, as well as with Romanian scholars specialized in it.\" Legal Opinion of Professor Sergiu Deleanu, School of Law, University \"Babes-Bolyai,\" Cluj-Napoca, Romania (2 Dec. 2013), para. 130 (CEW-2).\n\n250.\n\nThe Claimants are of the opinion that the Romanian courts were neither entitled to extensively review the merits of the international commercial arbitral award, nor to decide the counterclaim on the merits.\n\n251.\n\nThe Claimants conclude that the Court of Appeals' annulment decision deprived them, in \"breach of property rights under the European Convention on Human Rights\", of USD 14,377,352 and \u20ac 1,163,468, granted to them by the 2007 Romanian Award as compensation for their investment.266 In this context, the Claimants point out that international decisions considered that final awards compensating a foreign investor, such as the 2007 Romanian Award, are property rights or, more appropriately, part of the protected investment.267\n\nC-PHB, para. 113.\n\n*Id.* paras. 113-14.

People's Republic of Bangladesh* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/07), Award, at 166-67 (30 June 2009).\n\n252.\n\nThe full amount of damages suffered by the Claimants because of breaches of the BIT, the Claimants assert, corresponds to the full value of the 2007 Romanian Award, plus the attorneys' costs incurred by the Claimants in the annulment proceedings before the Romanian judiciary.268\n\nC-PHB, para. 115.\n\n*b)*  *The Respondent's Position*\n---------------------------------\n\n253.\n\nThe Respondent denies that it has breached Article 2(5) of the BIT. In support of its position, the Respondent relies on the views expressed by its expert witness on Romanian law, Professor Bazil Oglinda,269 who confirmed that the Court of Appeals acted lawfully in annulling the 2007 Romanian Award on the ground that it violated Romanian public policy pursuant to Article 364(i) of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure (\"CCP\"), which provides for annulment if i.a. the award \"infringes the public policy, the principles of morality or the imperative legal provisions.\"270 For the Respondent, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that the Award violated the equal treatment of the parties, AVAS' right of defense as well as the adversarial principle. The Respondent points out that also European legal systems and the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration allow annulment on such grounds.271\n\nHearing testimony of Bazil Oglinda (Hearing Transcript, 4 June 2014, at 663-99).\n\nArticle 364 (i) of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure (R-6, translated from Romanian into English); R- RL/RJ/CC, paras. 656-63; R-PHB, paras. 410-13.\n\nR-RL/RJ/CC, para. 666; R-PHB, paras. 415-16.\n\n254.\n\nThe Respondent endorses the Bucharest Court of Appeals in its decision that it was unacceptable that the arbitral tribunal had relied on an expert report produced by Gavazzi272 in breach of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure: the complexity of the case would have required the Arbitral Tribunal \"to perform a specialized expert appraisal,\"273 rather than basing itself on a unilateral expert report which the parties had requested to be reviewed by an independent expert.\n\n\"Gavazzi Steel S.A. - Determination of Damages in the Form of Lost Profit,\" report prepared by Deloitte & Touche, 9 Mar. 2004 (C-56).\n\nBucharest Court of Appeals, Commercial Section A VI-A, Commercial Decision No. 65 (Case No. 8799/2/2007), at 10 (22 Apr. 2009) (C-38, translated from Romanian into English)).\n\n255.\n\nFor Professor Oglinda, the Respondent's expert, in cases where \"amounts of money\" are at stake, \"accounting reports are essential, because the arbitrators are no experts and it will be very hard for them to pronounce a legal sentence [sic: award] in the absence of such a proof.\"274 By ignoring AVAS' request that the arbitral tribunal appoint an \"international expert\" to establish the damages suffered by the parties,275 the arbitral tribunal committed a \"serious infringement of the fundamental principle... of the right to a fair trial,\" in the sense that a refusal or omission by a tribunal to decide a request for evidence constitutes a breach of the adversarial principle.276\n\nHearing testimony of Bazil Oglinda (Hearing Transcript, 4 June 2014, at 666). The Respondent, in this connection, argues that, in the absence of a report on the assessment of damages prepared by a tribunal-appointed expert, the arbitral tribunal \"could not have issued an award,\" and that, if there is \"a need for a specialist to express [an] opinion concerning a matter in a trial[,] the respective court *must* resort to such expert.\" R-RPHB, para. 123.\n\n*See* 2002 Romanian Arbitration, Minutes of Hearing, 20 Mar. 2006 (C-71).\n\nR-PHB, paras. 462, 464; Bazil Oglinda, expert opinion, para. 105 (emphasis omitted).\n\n256.\n\nAs also the Court of Appeals stated, for the Respondent, Gavazzi's report was only an \"extrajudicial document.\" During the evidentiary hearing, it was clarified that by this term Respondent referred to a unilateral document produced by Claimant during those proceedings.277 The Respondent agrees with the Court of Appeals that the arbitral tribunal's reliance on the \"Master Plan Regarding the improvement of the Steel-plant department\", prepared by Kinglor Ltd. for Gavazzi Steel S.A. in April 2002,278 and the \"Plan of Judicial Reorganization of Gavazzi Steel S.A.,\" prepared by Iprolam S.A.,279 instead of appointing an independent expert, had to be sanctioned, because a document produced by a party cannot form the basis to award damages when both parties have requested the appointment of an independent expert on the very issues addressed by such a document.280 The Respondent also agrees with the Court of Appeals that the arbitral tribunal had erroneously stated that AVAS had acquiesced in that report's conclusions,281 and that the arbitral tribunal had wrongly based its 2007 Romanian Award on witness statements that could not be video-recorded due to technical problems, thereby rejecting AVAS' request to hear the witnesses in person.282 More generally, the Respondent concurs with the Court of Appeals' opinion that the arbitral tribunal did not afford to AVAS the \"actual possibility\" to support its arguments, invoke evidence, challenge Messrs. Gavazzi's evidence, and file procedural objections.283 Therefore, according to the Respondent and the Court of Appeals, the 2007 Romanian Award was based only on evidence presented by Messrs. Gavazzi, without regard to AVAS' rights.284\n\nR-RL/RJ/CC, para. 674; R-PHB, paras. 455-56, 462.\n\nC-55.\n\nC-57.\n\nR-RL/RJ/CC, para. 674; R-PHB, para. 462.\n\nR-PHB, paras. 440-41.\n\nR-RL/RJ/CC, para. 674; R-PHB, paras. 457, 470.\n\nR-PHB, para. 442.\n\nR-RL/RJ/CC, paras. 674.\n\n257.\n\nThe Court of Appeals, so asserts the Respondent, did not annul the award because it disagreed with the arbitral tribunal's assessment of the evidence, but rather because of \"breaches of the fundamental principles of procedure under Romanian law.\"285 Further, the Respondent asserts, the Court of Appeals did not review the merits of the dispute in the proceedings to annul the 2007 Romanian Award, but did so under Article 366 CCP only *after* the award was set aside, in order to render a decision on the merits.286\n\nR-RPHB, para. 125.\n\nArticle 366 of the Romanian Code of Civil Procedure provides:  \n*By admitting the action, the court will annul the arbitration award and, if the state of the proceedings so permits, it will also rule on the substance of the case, within the limits of the arbitration convention. However, if the ruling on the substance requires new evidence, the court will rule on the substance after such evidence is produced. In this last case, the annulment decision may only be challenged at the same time with the decision on the substance.*  \n*The court decision related to the action for annulment may only be challenged by second appeal.*  \n (R-6, translated from Romanian into English).\n\n258.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent alleges, the Claimants were afforded a full opportunity to exercise their rights of defence and to present their case before the Court of Appeals, both in the annulment proceedings and in the subsequent proceedings on the merits. They also availed themselves of their right of appeal. Accordingly, Respondent contends that at no time did it \"'impair Claimants' right to have access to [Romania's] courts of justice\" within the meaning of Article 2(5) of the BIT.287\n\nR-RL/RJ/CC, para. 670; R-PHB, para. 418.\n\n*c)*  *The Tribunal's Decision*\n-------------------------------\n\n259.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article 2(5) of the BIT requires Romania to \"provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights\" and that it may not \"impair the right of access to its Courts of Justice.\"\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal takes the view that whether the Respondent has breached Article 2(5) of the BIT may be decided based on the reasoning of the tribunal in *White Industries v. India*,288 where the tribunal expounded on the application of the \"effective means\" standard in BITs. This Tribunal notes that \"effective means,\" also the language used in Article 2(5) of the BIT at hand, is a wide notion that does not guarantee that each and every decision is correct. In the present case, the Tribunal notes that the complaint was not that there was no effective means for the Claimants to assert their claims and enforce their rights. Nor was the complaint that Romania has not respected the separation of powers and that the Romanian government has intervened in the judicial decision-making. Nor has it been alleged that the courts intended to deprive the Claimants of their fundamental rights. The Claimants criticize only that the decision that was arrived at, was wrong.\n\n*White Industries Australia Limited v. The Republic of India*, Final Award (UNCITRAL), para. 11.3.2 (30 Nov. 2011).\n\n261.\n\nThe Tribunal examines also the issue whether the Romanian courts' annulment of the 2007 Romanian Award amounts to an abuse of rights contrary to the international principle of good faith, *i.e.*, did they interpret and apply Article V(2)(b) of the New York Convention in a discriminatory manner?289\n\n*Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, Final Award (UNCITRAL), para. 525 (12 Nov. 2010).\n\n262.\n\nThis, in the eyes of this Tribunal, does not constitute an argument of a denial ofjustice but relates to judicial discretion, which is inherent in the application of the law and certainly in the assessment of public policy considerations. As was stated in *Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. v. Czech Republic* :\n\n526. *... [T]he reference to \"public policy\" in* *Article V* *(2)(b) of the New York Convention* *refers to... the particular national conception of international public policy that is relevant rather than to a conception of public policy that is in some way detached from the legal system at the place where recognition and enforcement is sought..*\n\n*527... States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation in determining what their own conception of international public policy is.*290\n\n*Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. v. Czech Republic*, Final Award (UNCITRAL), paras. 526-527 (12 Nov. 2010) (emphasis in original).\n\n263.\n\nThe Tribunal does not find proof that the Romanian Courts have abused the notion of \"public policy\" taking into account that they were entitled to interpret and apply this notion to protect essential principles of the Romanian legal order as they perceived it.\n\n264.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal accepts - with Dolzer and Schreuer - that even a \"clear and malicious application of the law\" might be covered by the principle of due process:\n\n*The principles of access to justice, fair procedure, and the prohibition of denial of justice relate to three stages of the judicial process: the right to bring a claim, the right of both parties to fair treatment during the proceedings, and the right to an appropriate decision at the end of the process. In Azinian v. Mexico, [the tribunal found that] \"[t]here is a fourth type of denial of justice, namely the*  ***clear and malicious application of the law*** *.* \"291\n\nHowever, in the present case, nothing along the lines of a \"clear and malicious application of the law\" has been proven by the Claimants.\n\nRUDOLF DOLZER &CHRISTOPH SCHREUER,PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW 163 (Oxford 2008) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted), *quoting* *Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian & Ellen Baca v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/97/2), Award, para. 103 (1 Nov. 1999).\n\n265.\n\nThe Tribunal also bears in mind the well-known passage from Brierly's *The Law of Nations* :\n\n*It will be observed that even on the wider interpretation of the term \"denial of justice\" which is here adopted, the misconduct must be extremely gross. The justification of this strictness is that the independence of courts is an accepted canon of decent government, and the law [i.e., international law] therefore does not hold a state responsible for their faults. It follows than an allegation of a denial of justice is a serious step which states, as mentioned above, are reluctant to take when a claim can be* *based on other grounds [i.e. an international claim in support of its aggrieved national].*292\n\nThe Tribunal does not find, on the evidence adduced in this arbitration, extremely gross misconduct by the Respondent's judiciary; and, hence, it decides that the Claimants' allegation of denial of justice is unproven.\n\nJ.L. BRIERLY, THE LAW OF NATIONS 287 (Oxford 1963).\n\n266.\n\nTherefore, the Tribunal dismisses all claims by the Claimants in this regard on the following ground: for the majority, for want of sufficient evidence to discharge the Claimants' burden of proof, and for the minority for lack of any such evidence.293\n\nFor the same reasons, the Tribunal concludes that there was no breach of Article 10(1) of the BIT.\n\n267.\n\nAll issues relating to heads of damages, quantification of damages, and other like matters will be considered by the Tribunal in the next phase of the proceedings.\n\n**IX. THE OPERATIVE PART**\n--------------------------\n\n268.\n\nFor the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) Jurisdiction Over the Claimants' Claims and Respondent's Counterclaim\n\na. The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants' claims under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention, and decides by majority that the Claimants' case is admissible.\n\nb. By majority: The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Respondent's counterclaim under the BIT.\n\n(2) Merits of the Claimants' Claims\n\na. By majority: Article 2(3) BIT: By its failure to restructure the Company's Debt, the Respondent committed a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article 2(3) of the BIT. The Tribunal therefore must assess the compensation for the breach of Article 2(3) in the next phase of this arbitration.\n\nb. By majority: Article 4(1) and 4(2) BIT: The Respondent's acts and omissions following the Government's Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 constituted an expropriation in breach of Articles 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. The Tribunal further decides that the Respondent breached Article 4(2)(c) of the BIT, which requires an appropriate procedure to determine the amount and method of payment of compensation in case of expropriation. The Tribunal therefore must assess compensation for breach of Article 4 in the next phase of this arbitration.\n\nc. Article 2(5) BIT: The Claimants have not proved that the Respondent, through its judiciary, failed to provide the Claimants with effective means to assert their claims and enforce their rights. Therefore the Respondent is not liable for breach of Article 2(5) of the BIT and Claimants' claims in this regard (including denial of justice) are dismissed.\n\n(3) Damages and Costs: All issues relating to compensation and related matters (including interest and allocation of costs) will be considered by the Tribunal in the next phase of this arbitration.\n\n(4) Save as ordered above, all other claims made by the Parties in this arbitration are dismissed.\n\nA dissenting opinion by arbitrator Mauro Rubino-Sammartano is attached hereto."}, {"Title": "Award (Excerpts)", "Type": "Award (Final)", "Date": "2017-04-18T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [{"Title": "Dissenting Opinion with Regard to Quantum by Mauro Rubino-Sammartano", "Type": "Dissenting Opinion", "Date": null, "Content": "Dissenting Opinion with Regard to Quantum by Mauro Rubino-Sammartano\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Summary of the proceedings**\n------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThese proceedings were introduced by a Request for Arbitration filed by the Claimants with ICSID on 23 July 2012.\n\n2.\n\nThe above Arbitral Tribunal was constituted.\n\n3.\n\nAn evidentiary hearing was held on jurisdiction, liability and counter-claim.\n\n4.\n\nThe parties exchanged pleadings before the hearing.\n\n5.\n\nThe Tribunal decided on jurisdiction, admissibility and liability on 17 April 2015, upholding jurisdiction and liability by majority, with a dissent from an arbitrator.\n\n6.\n\nThe proceedings have continued on the merits, more specifically on quantum.\n\n7.\n\nA hearing on quantum was held and the parties exchanged pleadings prior to that hearing.\n\n8.\n\nThe Claimants subsequently challenged the authenticity of two documents filed by the Respondent as Exhibits R-158 and R-177.\n\n9.\n\nThe Respondent requested that the Tribunal order a graphological examination of such exhibits in order to establish their authenticity.\n\n10.\n\nThe Claimants opposed such a request, arguing that the documents are irrelevant.\n\n11.\n\nThe parties exchanged post-hearing pleadings.\n\n12.\n\nThe Tribunal issued a procedural order denying the requested graphological examination, subject to a review when deciding on the quantum, with a dissent by an arbitrator.\n\n13.\n\nThe Tribunal is now deciding the quantum of the damages.\n\n14.\n\nI confirm herewith the views which I have expressed during the discussion which has led to this final decision and I express my dissent on the issues set out below, since in my opinion they involve matters of principle.\n\n**Reasons of the dissent**\n--------------------------\n\n**On loans treated as investments**\n-----------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe majority decision treats various amounts, which the Claimants allege to have paid to or for the company which they had purchased, as investments.\n\n16.\n\nThe Claimants are entitled to reimbursement of moneys paid to or for another entity, unless this has been expressly excluded.\n\n17.\n\nHowever, loans to another entity must be distinguished from investments.\n\n18.\n\nIn my opinion, loans (which - as in these proceedings - have been provided without any mention that they were to be converted into investments) may not be treated as investments, i.e. as \"a form of participation in the Company\", since the lender keeps his right to be repaid and in this respect he is a creditor, not an investor.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants could have stated that such moneys lent were intended to be (or could be converted into) investments. They did not do so and the lack of such statement is significant.\n\n20.\n\nThis must be viewed in the context where the Claimants made very few investments after the purchase of the shares of Socomet. Even their 2002-2008 \"business plan\" did not foresee investments from them, but from third parties. One wonders whether by making these investments (and even accelerating them, in view of the existing difficulties) the Claimants might have avoided the collapse of Socomet.\n\n21.\n\nIn my opinion, on the one hand the loans may not be treated as investments, but on the other hand, the Respondent's behaviour has deprived the Claimants of the right to recover such amounts. The Claimants are thus entitled to recover their loans to Socomet due to the Respondent's breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard in the BIT.\n\n22.\n\nWhile the alleged loans may not be treated as investments, the amounts which were actually lent to the company could nevertheless be awarded to Claimants under the heading of damages for breach of the FET.\n\n23.\n\nI do not consequently agree with the majority that the loans be used as a basis for the determination of the compensation for the loss of an opportunity.\n\n**On Claimants' claim for reimbursement of payments to Italian Expert Technicians**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n24.\n\nI concur with the majority's conclusion that this claim must be dismissed.\n\n25.\n\nAs to the grounds for such conclusion, in my opinion, the admitted illegality of the alleged payments to at least some of these technicians may not be tempered by the fact that Respondent was in breach under the BIT. A contractual breach by a party may not in my opinion justify or mitigate a breach of the law by the other party, even if it helps that party to remedy its need for cash.\n\n26.\n\nFurthermore, this claim in my opinion must be dismissed on the ground of breaches of the applicable Romanian law (likely both tax laws and labour laws in this case).\n\n**On the decision not to order the graphological examination of documents challenged by Claimants**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nI cannot share the final view of the majority that the above-mentioned documents submitted by the Respondent, allegedly originating from the Claimants and their counsel, would be irrelevant because they concern a settlement proposal which has not been confirmed by a settlement.\n\n28.\n\nWhile of course a settlement proposal may in no way be evidence of the amount due to the other party, unless the parties have settled for such amount, it is in my opinion a document to be taken into some account in establishing claimed damages.\n\n29.\n\nSince, even from this limited point of view the documents were not irrelevant to me, in my opinion a party cannot be deprived of the right to prove that a document - which is challenged - is authentic.\n\n30.\n\nFurthermore, the clarification of this challenge is in my view a further element to be considered in establishing the probative value of other evidence adduced in this proceeding.\n\n**On interest**\n---------------\n\n31.\n\nThe interest rate has to be stated, since interest rates vary, depending on the duration of time involved (a six months Libor rate is different from a one year Libor rate). The actual rate, the six months Libor rate, has therefore been stated in the BIT. In my opinion, Art. 4(2) of the BIT (by referring to Libor) states only the rate of interest and does not provide, either expressly or impliedly, for compound interest.\n\n32.\n\nIn the absence of a provision on compound interest in the BIT, it cannot in my opinion be considered as due *ipso jure* and, in my view, arbitral awards cannot rewrite the contents of an international treaty.\n\n33.\n\nFurthermore, compound interest is not viewed favorably in the Italian legal system and is frequently looked at (even if perhaps this is in many cases exaggerated) as closed to usury. The attitude of civil law jurisdictions is generally not in favor of compound interest and I anticipate this to be true of the Romanian legal system.\n\n34.\n\nGenerally speaking, compound interest may apply to loans in financial and banking transactions. In fact, in such transactions, if the money lent had been repaid, the lender could have invested it and earned interest on it. The amount of interest paid at the end of each given period would in turn produce interest.\n\n35.\n\nHowever, a distinction is to be made between a claim for late repayment of a loan and a claim for damages due (as in these proceedings) for a breach of a commitment. Compound interest is a head of damages which in my view does not apply to such other claims.\n\n36.\n\nIn any event, compound interest may be computed, in my view, only on an amount that has been established. In disputes about road or other accidents, for example, interest is calculated only from the time the amount of the damage is assessed. The amount of the disputed damages is determined then only when the precise amount of the damages is established, i.e. when the case is decided, provided the claim is not affected by any time bar.\n\n37.\n\nAs a result, if compound interest should be applied in this case, it could only be granted for the period of time after the award is rendered and until compliance with the award. In any event, compound interest can only be granted for the period of time from when it was claimed, in these proceedings on 7 July 2015. Granting compound interest for a period of time before it was claimed would in fact amount to deciding *ultra petita*. Therefore, no compound interest could be granted for the time period before that date.\n\n**On costs**\n\n38.\n\nI agree with the majority that the costs for the jurisdiction and liability phase of proceedings must follow the event.\n\n39.\n\nAs to the quantum phase, the arguments of the experts of both parties as to the amount of the damages caused by a breach of the BIT have failed and the Tribunal has based its decision on a different basis (on which it invited the parties' comments and on which the parties' submissions were not helpful). As a result, I am of the view that neither party should be entitled to payment of the costs for its experts or for their legal fees and expenses regarding this phase of the proceeding.\n\n40.\n\nEach party should then in my opinion bear all its own costs and fees for the quantum phase."}], "Content": "Award (Excerpts)\n----------------\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **FREQUENTLY USED ABBREVIATIONS AND ACRONYMS** | |\n| 2002 Business Plan | Gavazzi Steel S.A. \"Business Plan for an Investment Project in Rumania,\" June 2002 (C-54); |\n| 2007 Arbitration Award | Award of 30 October 2007 in the arbitration pursuant to the Share Purchase Contract |\n| Arbitration Rules | Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings |\n| AAAS | Authority for State Assets Administration |\n| APAPS | Authority for Privatization and Management of State Ownership |\n| AVAS | Authority for State Asset Recovery |\n| BIT | Agreement between the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of Romania on the Mutual Promotion and Protection of Investments |\n| C-l... | Claimants\u2019 Exhibits |\n| C-LA 1... | Claimants\u2019 legal authorities |\n| C-PHB | Claimants\u2019 Post-Hearing Brief, 9 May 2016 |\n| C-Request | Request for Arbitration, 23 July 2012 |\n| C-RJ/CC | Claimants\u2019 Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Counterclaim, 14 May 2014 |\n| C-RL/OJ/A/CC | Claimants\u2019 Reply on Liability, Objections to Jurisdiction/Admissibility and on the Counterclaim, 17 December 2013 |\n| C-RM | Claimants\u2019 Reply Memorial on Respondent\u2019s Objections to Jurisdiction and on the Admissibility of the Counterclaim, 31 July 2013 |\n| C-RPHB | Claimants\u2019 Reply Post-Hearing Brief, 22 June 2016 |\n| C-RQ | Claimants\u2019 Reply on Quantum, 23 November 2015 |\n| C-SSQ | Claimants\u2019 Second Submission on Quantum, 7 July 2015 |\n| Company or Socomet | S.C.

INTRODUCTION**\n-------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 21 April 2015, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction, Admissibility and Liability (\"Decision\"). The operative part of the Decision states:\n\n*(1) Jurisdiction Over the Claimants\u2019 Claims and Respondent\u2019s Counterclaim*\n\n*(a) The Tribunal has jurisdiction over the Claimants\u2019 claims under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention, and decides by majority that the Claimants\u2019 case is admissible.*\n\n*(b) By majority: The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over the Respondent\u2019s counterclaim under the BIT.*\n\n*(2) Merits of the Claimants\u2019 Claims*\n\n*(a) By majority: Article 2(3) BIT: By its failure to restructure the Company\u2019s Debt, the Respondent committed a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under Article 2(3) of the BIT. The Tribunal therefore must assess the compensation for the breach of Article 2(3) in the next phase of this arbitration.*\n\n*(b) By majority: Article 4(1) and 4(2) BIT: The Respondent\u2019s acts and omissions following the Government\u2019s Note No. 5/3228 of 17 May 1999 constituted an expropriation in breach of Articles 4(1) and (2) of the BIT. The Tribunal further decides that the Respondent breached Article 4(2)(c) of the BIT, which requires an appropriate procedure to determine the amount and method of payment of compensation in case of expropriation. The Tribunal therefore must assess compensation for breach of Article 4 in the next phase of this arbitration.*\n\n*(c) Article 2(5) BIT: The Claimants have not proved that the Respondent, through its judiciary, failed to provide the Claimants with effective means to assert their claims and enforce their rights. Therefore the Respondent is not liable for breach of Article 2(5) of the BIT and Claimants\u2019 claims in this regard (including denial of justice) are dismissed.*\n\n*(3) Damages and Costs: All issues relating to compensation and related matters**(including interest and allocation of costs) will be considered by the Tribunal in the next phase of this arbitration.*\n\n*(4) Save as ordered above, all other claims made by the Parties in this arbitration are dismissed.*\n\n2.\n\nAs to the Tribunal\u2019s Decision, Arbitrator Rubino-Sammartano issued a Partial Dissenting Opinion (\"Dissent\"). The Decision is incorporated into and forms part of this Award. For ease of reference, the Decision and the Dissent are appended to this Award as Annex 1.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n3.\n\nThe procedural history of this arbitration leading up to the Decision is contained in paragraphs 5-26 of the Decision. The following provides the procedural history of the arbitration from the date of the Decision to the date of this Award.\n\n4.\n\nThe Tribunal (by letter of 21 April 2015 sent by the ICSID Secretariat) invited the Parties to confer concerning the procedural timetable relating to the arbitration\u2019s further phase on quantum. In due course, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 on 9 May 2015, which provided the procedural calendar for the quantum phase. The Claimants were directed to develop further the arguments presented in their 15 July 2013 submission on quantum and accompanying expert report. In particular, the Tribunal directed the Claimants to \"elaborate on the methodology adopted by their Expert\" and to \"complete and qualify their case on quantum based on the Decision (see in particular paragraphs 241 and 242 of the Decision).\"\n\n5.\n\nOn 7 July 2015, the Claimants filed a Second Submission on Quantum (\"C-SSQ\") accompanied by a revised expert witness report by Mr Giovanni Gaspardo (of Deloitte) dated 29 June 2015 and Exhibits C-71 and C-72.1\n\nAn expert witness report of Mr Gaspardo dated 5 July 2013 was previously filed with the Claimants\u2019 Submission on Quantum dated 15 July 2013.\n\n6.\n\nOn 24 September 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 concerning further aspects of the procedural calendar.\n\n7.\n\nOn 14 October 2015, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on Quantum (\"R-CMQ\"), accompanied by an expert witness report of Mr Michael Peer (of KPMG) dated 1 October 2015, the second witness statement of Ms Viorica Tataru dated 1 October 2015, and Exhibits R-147 to R-181.\n\n8.\n\nOn 5 November 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 8 concerning still further aspects of the procedural calendar.\n\n9.\n\nOn 23 November 2015, the Claimants filed a Reply on Quantum (\"C-RQ\"), accompanied by an expert witness report by Mr Gaspardo (of Deloitte) dated 19 November 2015 and Exhibits C-73 to C-75. In their Reply, the Claimants objected to the second witness statement of Ms Tataru (which had been filed with the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Quantum) and requested that the statement be ruled inadmissible on the basis that her testimony was not relevant to the issues of quantum and instead re-opened issues finally determined during the liability phase by the Decision.\n\n10.\n\nOn 1 December 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9 concerning still further aspects of the procedural calendar.\n\n11.\n\nOn 8 January 2016, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder on Quantum (\"R-RQ\") accompanied by a second expert witness report by Mr Peer (of KPMG) dated 23 December 2015 and Exhibits R-182 and R-183. The Respondent also addressed the Claimants\u2019 objections to the second witness statement of Ms Tataru.\n\n12.\n\nThe President of the Tribunal (with the consent of the Parties and his co-arbitrators) held a pre-hearing organisational meeting with the Parties\u2019 legal representatives by telephone conference on 14 January 2016. During the telephone conference, the Parties\u2019 representatives presented their respective views concerning the second witness statement of Ms Tataru.\n\n13.\n\nOn 17 January 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, which contained a summary of the items discussed during the pre-hearing organisational meeting, including items which had been agreed between the Parties, and provided a timetable for the quantum hearing. The Order decided that the second witness statement of Ms Tataru would be admitted into evidence. It also invited the Parties to agree on a list of issues to be addressed during the joint examination of the Parties\u2019 quantum experts.\n\n14.\n\nA hearing on quantum took place in Paris, France, on 1-3 February 2016. In addition to the Members of the Tribunal and the Assistant Secretary of the Tribunal, Ms Celeste Mowatt, present at the hearing were:\n\nFor the Claimants:\n\nProfessor Avv. Giorgio Sacerdoti Counsel for the Claimants\n\nDr Avv. Anna De Luca Counsel for the Claimants\n\nMr Marco Gavazzi Claimant\n\nMr Stefano Gavazzi Claimant\n\nFor the Respondent:\n\nMs Alina Cobuz Cobuz & Associates Law Firm\n\nMr Daniel Visoiu Cobuz & Associates Law Firm\n\nMrs Diana Croitoru-Anghel Sirbu Manuela Law Office\n\nMrs Laura Voinea Legal Department of the Authority for\n\nState Assets Administration\n\nMs Emilia Toader Cobuz & Associates Law Firm\n\nMs Genoveva Luca Cobuz & Associates Law Firm\n\nMs Ramona Voinea Cobuz & Associates Law Firm\n\nMr Ovidiu Popescu KPMG\n\nMr Iulian Portasa KPMG\n\nThe following person was examined as a fact witness:\n\nMs Viorica Tataru Legal Department of the Authority for\n\nState Assets Administration\n\nThe following persons were examined as expert witnesses:\n\nOn behalf of the Claimants:\n\nMr Giovanni Gaspardo Deloitte\n\nMs Alessia Marrocchesi Deloitte\n\nOn behalf of the Respondent:\n\nMr Michael Peer KPMG\n\n15.\n\nDuring the hearing, Exhibit R-184 was admitted into the evidential record.2\n\nR-184 [,..]was referenced at R-CMQ, fn. 91. It was distributed in hard copy format at the hearing and an electronic copy of the exhibit was circulated on 18 February 2016.\n\n16.\n\nAlso during the hearing, the Respondent objected to certain information that was included in the presentation of the Claimants\u2019 expert witnesses (Mr Gaspardo and Ms Marrocchesi), on the basis that the Parties had agreed during the pre-hearing conference not to reference \"new damages figures or new evidence in presentations\", as recorded in paragraph 12 of Procedural Order No. 10. The Tribunal decided that new figures included in particular slides of the presentation would not be admitted into the evidential file; and it instructed the Parties to consult after the hearing to amend the hearing transcripts to remove all references to figures which had been decided by the Tribunal to be inadmissible. The Tribunal also instructed the Parties to file amended versions of their presentation slides with the inadmissible figures removed.3\n\nThese instructions were confirmed by letter of 18 February 2016.\n\n17.\n\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, following consultations with the Parties, the Tribunal decided that two rounds of post-hearing briefs would be filed by the Parties. These instructions were confirmed in the letter of 18 February 2016 sent by the ICSID Secretariat on behalf of the Tribunal. The Tribunal also requested that the Parties address certain issues in their post-hearing briefs,4 in particular: (i) the claim for moral damages, (ii) loss of opportunity and (iii) the Award and Partially Dissenting Opinion in *Quiborax v. Bolivia.5*\n\n*See* Hearing on Quantum Transcript, 3 February 2016, pp. 116-117.\n\n*Quiborax S.A., Non Metallic Minerals S.A. and Allan Fosk Kaplim v. Plurinational State of Bolivia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/2), Award and Partially Dissenting Opinion (16 September 2015).\n\n18.\n\nAt the hearing, each Party identified concerns related to Exhibits entered into evidence by the other Party. The Parties were invited to address these concerns further following the hearing.\n\n19.\n\nThe Claimants noted that the translation of Exhibit R-178 did not correspond with the original, Romanian version; and the Claimants also challenged the authenticity of Exhibits R-158 and R-177, which purported to be letters written by the Claimants (This controversy was addressed by the Tribunal\u2019s order of 12 April 2016: see below).\n\n20.\n\nThe Respondent stated that the electronic version of 13 Exhibits that it received from the Claimants were mis-numbered, and did not match the hard copy that it received, nor the index of exhibits provided by the Claimants. As instructed by the Tribunal, the electronic version of those exhibits received by ICSID were made available to the Respondent.\n\n21.\n\nOn 29 February 2016 the Respondent proposed revisions to the hearing transcript in order to address the removal of references to figures that the Tribunal had decided to be inadmissible. The Claimants commented on the Respondent\u2019s proposed transcript revisions on 3 March 2016. The Parties made further comments on the proposed transcript revisions on 7 and 8 March 2016.\n\n22.\n\nOn 12 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 11, by which the Tribunal: (i) decided that Exhibits R-158 and R-177 would remain in the evidential record, and that the Tribunal would consider the disputed authenticity of the documents when evaluating their probative value; (ii) ordered the Respondent to file a corrected translation of Exhibit R-178; and (iii) decided on the disputed revisions to the hearing transcripts. In addition, the Tribunal confirmed its understanding that the issue between the Parties concerning the numbering of certain exhibits received by the Respondent had been resolved.\n\n23.\n\nOn 15 April 2016, the Respondent filed a corrected translation of Exhibit R-178 and requested the Tribunal to order a graphological examination of Exhibits R-158 and R-177 to address the disputed authenticity of the documents. The Claimants commented on the Respondent\u2019s request on 18 April 2016, and the request was subsequently addressed in further correspondence from the Parties.\n\n24.\n\nOn 22 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12, by which the Tribunal confirmed its decision set out in Procedural Order No. 11 and declined to order a graphological examination of Exhibits R-158 andR-177. Paragraph 10 of Procedural Order No. 12 noted that the decision was taken by a majority of the Tribunal, and that the reasons for Arbitrator Rubino-Sammartano\u2019s dissent would be provided separately. Arbitrator Rubino-Sammartano\u2019s Dissenting Opinion on Procedural Order No. 12 was issued on 27 April 2016.\n\n25.\n\nOn 9 May 2016, the Parties filed their Post-Hearing Briefs. The Claimants\u2019 Brief (\"C-PHB\") was accompanied by legal authorities C-LA 11 through C-LA 18, and the Respondent\u2019s brief was accompanied by a letter dated 4 May 2016 from the Respondent\u2019s expert witness, Mr Michael Peer (the \"KPMG Letter\").\n\n26.\n\nBy email of 9 May 2016, the Claimants objected to the filing of KPMG and requested that it not be admitted. The Respondent provided its response on 10 May 2016. By letter of 17 May 2016, the Tribunal decided that the KPMG Letter would not be admitted as an independent expert opinion or exhibit, but it granted to the Respondent the opportunity to resubmit its Post-Hearing Brief in order to incorporate non-evidentiary elements from the KPMG Letter.\n\n27.\n\nIn accordance with the Tribunal\u2019s directions in its letter of 17 May 2016, the Respondent filed its re-submitted Post-Hearing Brief on 3 June 2016 (\"R-PHB\").\n\n28.\n\nBy email of 7 June 2016, the Claimants objected to the admission of certain portions of the Respondent\u2019s re-submitted Post-Hearing Brief (scenarios B and C). The Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 objection on 10 June 2016. On 13 June 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Claimants\u2019 objection was not sustained, but it allowed the Claimants the opportunity to reformulate their objection in view of the Respondent\u2019s response of 10 June 2016.\n\n29.\n\nOn 16 June 2016, the Claimants submitted their reformulated objection concerning scenarios B and C of the Respondent\u2019s re-submitted Post-Hearing Brief. The Claimants requested the Tribunal to declare those portions of the Respondent\u2019s Brief to be inadmissible and, in the event that the Tribunal decided to admit scenarios B and C, requested the Tribunal to re-admit all new figures presented by the Claimants\u2019 expert witnesses at the hearing. The Respondent responded to the Claimants\u2019 reformulated objection on 17 June 2016. By letter of 17 June 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it maintained its previous decision to admit scenarios B and C in the re-submitted brief, and that the Tribunal granted the Claimants request to re-admit the figures referenced by the Claimants\u2019 expert witnesses at the hearing.\n\n30.\n\nBy letter of 15 June 2016, the Respondent requested permission to file an additional exhibit, a letter of 2 October 2002, in connection with the challenged authenticity of Exhibits R-158 and R-177. Following the Tribunal\u2019s invitation, the Claimants responded to the Respondent\u2019s request by letter of 20 June 2016, objecting to the admission of the new document and maintaining the Claimants\u2019 position concerning the non-authenticity of Exhibits R-158 and R-177.\n\n31.\n\nOn 21 June 2016, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to reverse its decision to readmit the figures referenced by the Claimants\u2019 expert witnesses during the hearing and, in the alternative, requested an opportunity to comment on those figures. On 22 June 2016, the Claimants undertook that they would not rely on the figures which had previously been declared inadmissible in their Reply Post-Hearing Brief.\n\n32.\n\nOn 22 June 2016, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their respective Reply Post-Hearing Briefs (\"C-RPHB\" and \"R-RPHB\").\n\n33.\n\nBy letter of 28 June 2016, the Tribunal: (i) confirmed its understanding that the Claimants were not relying on the figures from the presentation of their expert witnesses which had previously been declared inadmissible and that, in the result, the figures were not considered to be a part of the record of the hearing;6 (ii) informed the Parties that the Tribunal would admit the letter of 2 October 2002 (and its translation); and (iii) invited the Parties to make any further comments in respect of these matters by 1 July 2016.\n\nThe Tribunal also noted in that letter, \"that the Respondent has included some comments on the figures in its Reply Post-Hearing-Brief (paragraph 213), which the Tribunal will not take into account in view of the fact that the figures have not been relied upon by the Claimants.\"\n\n34.\n\nFurther to the Tribunal\u2019s instructions of 28 June 2016, on 29 June 2016, the Respondent filed the letter of 2 October 2002 (and its translation) as Exhibit R-184. On 1 July 2016, the Claimants commented on the Tribunal\u2019s decision to admit the document and the translation provided by the Respondent. By letter of 8 July 2016, the Tribunal noted the Claimants\u2019 comments concerning the translation of Exhibit R-l84, and maintained its decision to admit the exhibit and to attach to it the weight that it considered appropriate.\n\n35.\n\nOn 28 July 2016, the Claimants and the Respondent filed their respective submission on costs. By email of 5 August 2016, the Claimants filed their response to the Respondent\u2019s cost submission. On 10 August 2016, the Respondent filed its response to the Claimants\u2019 cost submission.\n\n36.\n\nThese proceedings were closed on 11 January 2017, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 38.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL\u2019S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n37.\n\nA summary of the factual circumstances of the case is set out in Section IV (paragraphs 37-79) of the Decision. The Parties\u2019 submissions during the quantum phase are briefly summarised below. This summary has been prepared by the Tribunal to set in context the several decisions made by the Tribunal in this Award. It is not an exhaustive summary of the Parties\u2019 respective cases presented during this arbitration over many thousands of pages. The fact that a particular submission is not expressly referenced below should not be taken as any indication that it has not been considered by the Tribunal.\n\n**A. Overview of the Parties\u2019 Positions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n*a.* *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*b.* *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**B. Authenticity and Relevance of Settlement Documents**\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nAs described above in Section II, the Claimants have disputed the authenticity of certain documents submitted by the Respondent during the quantum phase. In particular, the Claimants challenge Exhibits R-158 and R-177, which were filed with the Respondent\u2019s Counter-Memorial on Quantum, and Exhibit R-184, which was admitted pursuant to the Tribunal\u2019s directions of 28 June and 8 July 2016.7 The Respondent claims that AVAS received these three documents from the Claimants in 2002, shortly after the insolvency of the Company.8\n\nC-RPHB, paras. 113-121. The Claimants also dispute the accuracy of the translation of R-184, which was filed by the Respondent.\n\nC-RPHB, para. 113.\n\n45.\n\nIn summary, the Claimants contend that Exhibits R-158 and R-177 are not authentic and, in any event, take the position that the documents are not relevant to this quantum phase:\n\n[...]\n\n46.\n\nIn summary, the Respondent argues that Exhibits R-158, R-177 andR-184, should be taken into account by the Tribunal as they represent an independent and contemporaneous evaluation made by the Claimants concerning the value of their shares in Socomet in September and October 2002, shortly after the alleged expropriation date. The Respondent argues that the evaluation reflected in these documents was based on the full information available to the Claimants at that time, including the 2002 business plan, on which the Claimants\u2019 damages claims are based.9\n\n*See* Gavazzi Steel S.A. \"Business Plan for an Investment Project in Rumania,\" June 2002 (C-54).\n\n47.\n\nThe Tribunal, by majority, agrees with the Claimants that Exhibits R-158 and R-177, allegedly dated September 2002 and referring to settlement negotiations between the Claimants and AVAS, of which the Claimants challenge the authenticity, are irrelevant to assess the value of Claimant\u2019s share in Socomet Settlement offers reflect complex \u2018give-and-takes\u2019 whereby the money requested for the transfer of shares includes a cluster of other considerations as well. Moreover, in the case at stake the settlement offer apparently never was implemented. Consequently, the Tribunal does not need to consider whether Exhibits R-158 and R-177 were authentic.\n\n**C. Article 4 - Expropriation**\n--------------------------------\n\n***i. Legal Standard for Compensation***\n----------------------------------------\n\n*a.* *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*b.* *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*c.* *The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nThe Tribunal will determine the compensation pursuant to the standards provided for by Article 4 of the BIT and, whenever necessary, by customary international law.\n\n***ii. Date of Valuation***\n---------------------------\n\n*a.* *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*b.* *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*c.* *The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n62.\n\nThe Tribunal, by majority, agrees with Claimants that the appropriate valuation date for the breach of Article 4 of the BIT is August 2002, i.e. when the Claimants were deprived of their investment.\n\n***iii. Valuation Methodology***\n--------------------------------\n\n*a.* *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*b.* *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*c.* *The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n**Socomet is not a \"going concern\"**\n------------------------------------\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal decides that Socomet was not a going concern at any relevant time, within the meaning of the World Bank Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment or by any other test. The Tribunal in particular finds, on the evidence, the following facts:\n\na) the Claimants\u2019 acknowledgment that it is:\n\n[...]\n\nb) the testimony of the Claimants that:\n\n[...]\n\nc) the fact that thereafter, including the times of the Respondent\u2019s several violations of the BIT, the Company remained in a precarious financial position threatening its future existence, with no realistic prospect of improving that position without significant further support, both financial and managerial, from the Claimants and their own supporters.\n\nd) the low price of [...]for which the Respondent sold the company in 1999 indicates that it was not a going concern at that time.10\n\n*See* R-RPHB, para. 90 citing also C-PHB, para. 123.\n\n85.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal concludes that Socomet was never a going concern at any material time.\n\n**The Unlevered Income-based Evaluation**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal further notes that the Claimants admit that no past records of the company\u2019s cash flow are available.11 Thus, the Claimants\u2019 expert witness could not evaluate compensation on the basis of future estimated cash flows projected from past records of cash flow and profitability: \"because of the lack of information regarding the financial projections of the Company, especially in terms of accounts payables/receivables and inventory dynamics.\"12\n\nC-PHB, para. 178.\n\nDeloitte Report, Section 7.2, pp. 43-44, as quoted in C-PHB, para. 109.\n\n87.\n\nIn these circumstances, the Tribunal decides that it would be inappropriate in this case to use any cash flow-based approach to assess compensation under the BIT when the company was never a going concern and lacked any objective record of any profitability, whether past or present. Its approach here is based on commercial common sense applied to this case\u2019s particular features, an approach supported by the decisions of many other tribunals addressing similar facts.\n\n88.\n\nFor example, in *Benvenuti & Bonfant v. Congo,* the tribunal decided that it could not base its evaluation of the company on its expected earnings, as only one contracted shipment had actually been delivered, and that was insufficient for the tribunal to consider the company a going concern.13 Similarly, in *Asian Agricultural Products v. Sri Lanka,* the tribunal found that the company\u2019s operations for at least two or three years would be necessary to establish a reliable basis for estimating future profitability.14 The Iran-United States Claims Tribunal (\"IUSCT\") in *American International Group v. Iran,* considered a period of four and a half years still too short to establish an appropriate forecast for future profitability.15 The IUSCT, in *CBS v. Iran,* also declined to use a Discounted Cash Flow (\"DCF\")-based valuation where a company operating in the past had experienced losses.16\n\n*S.A.R.L. Benvenuti & Bonfant v. People\u2019s Republic of the Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/77/2), Award (15 August 1980) (hereinafter *\"Benvenuti & Bonfant v. Congo*\"), paras. 4.71 and 4.78.\n\n*Asian Agricultural Products Limited v. Republic of Sri Lanka* (ICSID Case No. ARB/87/3), Award (27 June 1990) (hereinafter *\"Asian Agricultural Products v. Sri Lanka\"),* para. 103.\n\n*American International Group v. Iran,* 4 Iran-US CTR (1983) 96, p. 108.\n\n*CBS Inc. v. Iran,* 25 Iran-US CTR (1990) 131, para. 52.\n\n89.\n\nIn *Southern Pacific Properties v. Egypt,* where 6% of the project contracted had already been completed, the tribunal found a past cash flow-based valuation inappropriate since the project was still \"in its infancy\".17 The tribunal found that \"the DCF method is not appropriate for determining the fair compensation in this case because the project was not in existence for a sufficient period of time to generate the data necessary for a meaningful DCF calculation\".18 The Tribunal returns to the *SPP* award below (paragraphs 218-220).\n\n*Southern Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/84/3), Award (20 May 1992) (hereinafter *\"SPP v. Egypt\"* or *\"SPP* award\"), para. 188.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n90.\n\nLikewise, in *Metalclad v. Mexico,* a cash flow-based valuation was rejected by the tribunal because the operations of the company had not yet started, and therefore any compensation based on future profits was \"wholly speculative\". Referring to earlier ICSID and IUSCT awards,19 the NAFTA tribunal decided:\n\n*Normally, the fair market value of a going concern which has a history of profitable operation may be based on an estimate of future profits subject to a discounted cash flow analysis. [...] However, where the enterprise has not operated for a sufficiently long time to establish a performance record or where it has failed to make a profit, future profits cannot be used to determine going concern or fair market value.20*\n\nDecisions cited by the *Metalcad* tribunal included *AGIP SpA v. Congo* (ICSID Case No. ARB/77/1), Award (30 November 1979), *Benvenuti & Bonfant v. Congo, Asian Agricultural Products v. Sri Lanka,* and *Sola Tiles Inc. v. Iran,* 14 Iran-US CTR 224.\n\n*Metalclad v. Mexico,* paras. 119-120.\n\n91.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Wena Hotels v. Egypt* rejected a cash flow method due to the short duration of the company\u2019s operations and the lack of sufficient data.21 Citing with approval the decisions in *Metalclad v. Mexico, Southern Pacific Properties v. Egypt,* and *American**Manufacturing and Trading v. Zaire,22* the tribunal concluded that an award based on a DCF method in such circumstances would be \"too speculative\".23\n\n*Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4), Award (8 December 2000) (hereinafter *\"Wena Hotels v. Egypt\"),* para. 123.\n\n*American Manufacturing and Trading Inc v. Zaire* (ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1), Award (21 February 1997), para. 7.14.\n\n*Wena Hotels v. Egypt,* para. 123.\n\n92.\n\nThis line of reasoning was also followed by the tribunal in *T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales v. Mexico,* where a period of two years, coupled with the difficulties in obtaining objective data and the fact that future cash flow depended upon investments to be made in the long term, \"lead the Arbitral Tribunal to disregard such [discounted cash flow] methodology to determining the relief to be awarded to the Claimant.\"24\n\n*T\u00e9cnicas Medioambientales SA v. United Mexican States* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2), Award (29 May 2003), para. 186.\n\n93.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the tribunals in *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela25* and *Enron v. Argentina26* decided than an income-based cash flow method was appropriate in determining the amount of compensation claimed in those cases. In *Gold Reserve v. Venezuela,,* the tribunal used the DCF method to calculate compensation even though the business in question was still not operational at the time of the breach. However, the reason, as submitted by the Respondent,27 was because the tribunal was persuaded that the DCF method could be used reliably because of the nature of the product as a commodity, a detailed cash flow analysis previously performed and, moreover, the testimony of both parties\u2019 experts who agreed upon the use of the DCF model.28 In *Enron v. Argentina,* the tribunal was persuaded that the valuation could be based on long-term contracts where the future profitability depended on objective economic circumstances, such as consumer demand and expenditures.29 All these factors are absent in the present case and, to the mind of this Tribunal, materially distinguish the factual circumstances of these two cases from the features of the case before this Tribunal.\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/(AF)/09/l), Award (22 September 2014) (hereinafter *\"Gold Reserve v. Venezuela\").*\n\n*Enron Creditors Recovery Corp, (formerly Enron Corporation) and Ponderosa Assets LP v. Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/3), Award (22 May 2007) (hereinafter *\"Enron v. Argentina\").*\n\nR-RPHB, para. 85.\n\n*Gold Reserve v. Venezuela,* para. 830.\n\n*Enron v. Argentina,* para. 369.\n\n94.\n\nOn the basis of this analysis, the Tribunal concludes that its approach is consistent with the reasoning of other tribunals who were faced with materially similar factual situations, and that the DCF method or any cash flow-based approach cannot be used to determine compensation in the present case.\n\n95.\n\nHowever, the DCF method, although extensively debated by the Parties, is not directly relevant to the present case. Indeed, the Claimants have not evaluated their claimed compensation on the basis of Socomet\u2019s past record of cash flow and profitability. The Claimants invoked another method, the \"Unlevered Income Valuation\". The Deloitte Report submitted by the Claimants\u2019 expert witnesses describe this method as follows:\n\n[...]\n\n96.\n\nAccording to the same Deloitte Report:\n\n[...]\n\n97.\n\nThe unlevered income-based valuation takes into account the profitability of sectorial comparators. In this context, the Tribunal accepts that other steel mills and companies in Romania, such as Mittal, turned a profit, *i.e.,* they were or became successful going concerns. Another point that the Tribunal considers potentially relevant is the fact that the September 2004 Report submitted to the local court in the Severin Case brought by IPROLAM found that, after the restructuring and sale of Unit 1, the entity became a profitable concern.30\n\nC-RPHB, para. 107.\n\n98.\n\nConversely, the Tribunal is aware that the Respondent considers the unlevered income valuation method to be inappropriate in the present case, given that Socomet was not a going concern at any relevant time.31\n\nR-RPHB, para. 20#\n\n99.\n\nConsidering the definition of the unlevered income method (as described by the Claimants\u2019 expert witnesses), the Tribunal does not accept that a necessary prerequisite for the application of this method is that the entity must be a going concern. The Tribunal observes that the unlevered income method is based upon general parameters, such as reference to data from other European comparable companies, and that such materials are also adjusted to the relevant stock exchange, country risk and market risks, as well as to the usual rate of return on risk-free assets. The Tribunal moreover notes the testimony of the Claimants\u2019 expert witnesses that the unlevered income method:\n\n[...]\n\n100.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view there is no necessity for Socomet to have been a going concern for the unlevered income valuation method to apply in the present case. Accordingly, the Tribunal is willing to apply the unlevered income-based valuation method if the other conditions for its application are fulfilled.\n\n**The 2002 Business Plan offers no solid basis for an evaluation of future income**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimants applied the unlevered income valuation method \"on the basis of the 2002 Business Plan prepared by the Management\".32 The Claimants allege that with the waiver of the debts, the injection of [...] and the implementation of the 2002 Business Plan, the company could have started to make a profit in 2008. Indeed, for the Claimants, in the specific circumstances of the case and on the basis of the 2002 Business Plan, the Claimants \"would have lower-fulfilled [sic] their investment obligations under the Privatisation Contract... and effected the complete turnaround of Gavazzi Steel... \"33\n\nC-PHB, para. 176.\n\nC-RPHB, para. 15. This is the \"Scenario B\" situation, as put forward by the Respondent, a scenario whereby \"[...].\"\n\n102.\n\nAs is apparent, the Claimants\u2019 approach depends, critically, on the efficacy of the 2002 Business Plan. If materially ineffective, the Plan does not support the forecast of the profitability of Socomet alleged by the Claimants. In the tribunal\u2019s view, the Plan was not effective in three material respects.\n\n(i) The 2002 Business Plan remained embryonic\n---------------------------------------------\n\n103.\n\nFirst, as a fact, the Tribunal decides that the 2002 Business Plan remained embryonic. The Tribunal accepts the criticisms to this effect made by the Respondent\u2019s expert witness, Mr Peer (of KPMG), namely, that the bank financing allegedly obtained from HypoVereinsbank \"was not in fact even close to being finalized\".34 Likewise, the Tribunal finds, as a fact, that a proposed partnership between Socomet and Techint \"was only in an incipient stage\".35 The Tribunal concludes that the 2002 Business Plan was never finalised, legally or commercially, contrary to the Claimants\u2019 submission.\n\nR-RPHB, para. 113, also KPMG Report, Section 5.5 and Second KPMG Report Section 6.1.1(f).\n\nR-RPHB, para. 114, also KPMG Report, Section 5.5.\n\n(ii) Financing of the 2002 Business Plan remained uncertain\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n104.\n\nSecond, the Tribunal finds, as fact, that the financing aspect of the 2002 Business Plan was unduly optimistic.\n\n105.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there were several overdue debts that had not been financed. The Claimants allege that, as of 2002, the amount of overdue debts, after factoring in the historical debts of [... ]36 and discounted at the valuation date, stood at [... ].37\n\nC-RPHB, para. 43. *See also* the details of the \"Net financial position\" in the Deloitte Report, pp. 49-50.\n\nC-PHB, para. 176.\n\n106.\n\nThe costs of refurbishment under the 2002 Business Plan were described to be a total of [\u2026].38\n\nSee [...], C-55.\n\n107.\n\nThe 2002 Business Plan thus required, for the costs of refurbishment, the financing of almost [...]. The Claimants do not submit sufficient evidence to establish that this financing was probable, still less actually agreed or otherwise certain. The Tribunal concludes that, as the Respondent submitted, the net debt estimate submitted by the Claimants \"does not factor in the financing of the purported investment... of [...].39 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the Respondent correctly states that, by \"not providing for the investment required to achieve the projected earnings relied upon by the Claimants\u2019 expert [witness] the estimated damages are overstated.\"40\n\nR-PHB, para. 195.\n\n*Id.,* para. 196.\n\n108.\n\nThe weakness in the financing aspect of the Business Plan is well illustrated by the Claimants\u2019 assumption that the financing offer by Hypo Vereinsbank of 7 September 2001 would cover \"the costs of the investment provided in part by Techint and Simest\".41 However, the Tribunal notes that this offer was for a reduced sum of [...]42 and that, moreover, of that [... ] was to have been obtained from Hypo Vereinsbank itself. The other [...] was to be a buyer-credit (to buy the equipment that Techint was to supply) to be granted by Romania Commercial Bank.43 Moreover, that facility needed the preliminary approval of three other entities (SACE, SIMEST, and the Hypo Vereinsbank Credit Committee).44 Still further, the financing by Hypo Vereinsbank and Romania Commercial Bank was conditional upon the Claimants\u2019 own funding.45 There is no sufficient evidence to establish that these cumulative conditions for financing were or could have been obtained by the Claimants.46\n\nC-PHB, para. 153.\n\nC-51,p. 2.\n\nC-RPHB, para. 34. *See also* R-PHB, para. 37.\n\nC-51,p. 2.\n\n*See e.g.,* R-155, p. 1, where the fund request was rejected by the Romania Commercial Bank on the grounds that there was no evidence of funding made available by the majority shareholders.\n\n*See also* R-RPHB, para. 39.\n\n109.\n\nIn fact, the Claimants themselves accept that the Romania Commercial Bank did not fulfill its obligations due to Socomet\u2019s bank accounts being blocked by the Respondent.47 Moreover, two months after the financing offer of HypoVereinsbank of 7 September 2001, the Claimants mortgaged Socomet\u2019s assets in order to obtain loans from Romania Commercial Bank so as to finance a distribution agreement with Mi&Cor Comaltex S.R.L.48 Socomet thereby guaranteed Mi&Cor\u2019s exposure to the Romania Commercial Bank in the amount of approximately [...]49 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, as the Respondent submits, these mortgages, pledges of fixed assets and promissory notes could have been used to obtain the necessary financing of Socomet\u2019s new plant.50 This was, of course, a management decision for the Claimants to make at the time, which reduced the company\u2019s ability to raise financing for its refurbishment.51\n\nC-PHB, para. 161. *See also* the testimony of the then-manager of Techint, Mr de Carpegna (Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability Transcript, 4 June 2014, p. 544).\n\nR-160.\n\nR-PHB, para. 43.\n\nKPMG Report, para. 5.2.3. *See also* R-PHB, para. 43.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n110.\n\nMoreover, aside from the [...] costs of refurbishment, it is necessary to consider the increased working capital requirements of [...].52 As the Claimants themselves acknowledged, overdue debts are part of the company\u2019s net financial position.53 Excluding costs of refurbishment and of increased working capital requirements from consideration results in a skewed calculation of the amount of overdue debts, which could have a direct impact on the calculation of compensation in the present case.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 expert admitted that the Business Plan focus was on the industrial project, but did not focus on working capital dynamics, which generally involve short-term as needs, since the main financing for the investment in the Consteel technology was practically finalized\u2019 (Deloitte Report, Section 7.2, pp. 43-44, as quoted in C-PHB, para. 109).\n\n*See e.g.,* C-RPHB, para. 42, Table 10.\n\n111.\n\nHowever, the point discussed above is, for the Tribunal, merely a preliminary matter. Two other issues arise in relation to the Claimants\u2019 2002 Business Plan: (a) the payment of costs and (b) the length of the forecast. The Tribunal will next address these two issues in turn.\n\n112.\n\nIn relation to the payment of costs, the Tribunal notes that, according to the Kinglor Master Plan and the corresponding figures in the 2002 Business Plan, approximately Consteel of the industrial and equipment investments were \"internal workshop\".54 An additional cost for \"[m]iscellaneous, transport, insurance, custom duties\" of approximately [...] was also alleged by the Claimants to \"be covered by current income.\"55 Moreover, according to the Kinglor Master Plan, the Consteel equipment and technology was to be installed in 22 months from mid-2002; and those direct costs amounted to USD [...]56 These were, therefore, costs that did not require additional financing and can be deducted from the costs requiring financing.\n\nC-RPHB, para. 31.\n\n*Ibid.,* citing C-55 and Deloitte Report Report, pp. 33-34.\n\nC-RPHB, para. 32, citing C-55, Table 2 [...].\n\n113.\n\nIn their Second Submission on Quantum, the Claimants provided their evaluation of Socomet\u2019s income based on future production which, so the Tribunal notes, consists of figures that are materially different from those in the 2002 Business Plan.57 The Claimants also make several assumptions when computing Socomet\u2019s income, including diversifying production, prices of scrap, prices of steel and lower salaries.58 Indeed, the Claimants submit that production would see an annual growth of [...]% from 2002 to 2008, with EBITDA growth reflecting both the change in product mix and the cost efficiencies achieved by the introduction of the Consteel technology.59\n\nC-PHB, para. 194ff, and in particular Table 4 on pp. 72-73, para. 195.\n\n*Id.,* paras. 153, and 188-201; C-RPHB, paras. 16-21.\n\nC-PHB, para. 196.\n\n114.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, these assumptions appear to make the \"hypothetically restructured Socomet...an overly profitable outlier in its industry\", as the Respondents submitted.60 According to the figures provided by the Claimants, the targeted annual output of [...] would have been achieved with an investment that amounts to between a third and a quarter of the investments of other comparators in the market.61 While such optimistic forecasts of future income and profitability may be appropriate were it accounted for in the cost of capital and the risk of not achieving such targets, the Claimants\u2019 expert witness acknowledged that such assumptions and targets were [...]:\n\n[...]\n\nR-PHB, para. 182.\n\nKPMG, para. 6.11.6.\n\n115.\n\nFurther, any hypothetical production increase is, for present purposes, irrelevant if it was not shown, as a fact, that Socomet was able to finance its operations. The Tribunal has already decided that Socomet was never a going concern.62 Any expected profitability on the part of Socomet relied almost exclusively on the 2002 Business Plan, but the financing that needed to implement the 2002 Business Plan had not been secured. In this regard, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants had not established any profitability on the part of Socomet in accordance with the 2002 Business Plan.63\n\n*See supra* paras.84-85.\n\nR-PHB, para. 206. *See also* R-RPHB, paras. 17-19, and 93.\n\n116.\n\nOther questions weigh upon the costs of the financing sought by Socomet. The Tribunal questions whether the [... ]% figure given in relation to the weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") is reliable.64 The Claimants\u2019 expert witnesses (of Deloitte) used [...]% as the cost of debt for Gavazzi Steel in its calculation of the WACC.65 Given that these figures included the allocation of the costs of debt and the return on equity, and the fact that equity holders would not receive dividends when profits were reinvested or used to pay debts,66 the Tribunal finds it, for instance, unrealistic that only [...] was evaluated as the risk that the 2002 Business Plan would not be fully implemented. Given that the costs of acquiring assets were also excluded,67 and the pre-2002 debts had not been covered, this [...] risk evaluation was manifestly unrealistic in the circumstances of this case.\n\n*See* Deloitte Report, at p. 48, Table 8. *See also* C-RPHB, paras. 38-39.\n\nC-RPHB, fn. 32.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 190-197.\n\nR-PHB, para. 188.\n\n117.\n\nThe second issue relates to the length of the forecast provided. The evaluations were made for 2002, 2008 and 2013.68 In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the span of these forecasts multiplies the unreliability factor, since the forecasts were all based upon the 2002 Business Plan.\n\n*See* [...], Annex 3.\n\n(iii) Acquisition of Socomet shares remained uncertain\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nThird, the Tribunal considers that the indirect acquisition of [...]% of Socomet shares by Techint and Simest through the joint venture Mosella Acciai - another element of the Business Plan - was and remained too uncertain. The Tribunal notes that only an unsigned draft letter of intent69 existed and that the shares sale option was never signed. It was therefore never established as a fact that SIF-Banat, the minority shareholder, agreed to the sale of [...]% of Socomet shares. Further, there is no reliable evidence as to what price those [...]% of Socomet shares would have commanded.70 The Tribunal finds, therefore, that the sale of [... ]% of Socomet shares was not concluded - or would be concluded - and that it cannot be considered as a fact in evaluating the company\u2019s profitability based on the 2002 Business Plan.\n\nC-53.\n\n[...], para. 5.6.4.\n\n119.\n\nIn the present case, therefore, the Tribunal concludes for all the above reasons, that the Claimants have not established their evaluation of the \"effective and fair market value\" of the company as to their [... ] its shares, being [... ] out of a total value [... ]\n\n**Compensation under equitable objective principles**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nAs decided above, for the various reasons stated here below, the Tribunal cannot base its assessment of compensation on the 2002 Business Plan. The Plan was based (a) on the assumption that only [... ] employees were to be employed (instead of [... ] which had been planned), (b) on prices for scrap and for sale of the finished products that were highly volatile, (c) without taking into account possible initiatives from the competition, or an adequate working capital, and (d) was subject to many variables, such as the price of electricity. Moreover, the implementation of the Plan, which was only in an embryonic stage, had still many flaws, as indicated above. At the time the 2002 Business Plan was drafted by Claimants, they should have been aware that their financial situation was precarious and that insolvency, which followed 1.5 months later, was imminent. In fact, it has even been suggested that the Business Plan was written to offer a platform to claim damages.71 This does not mean that the Claimants\u2019 claims for compensation must be dismissed by the Tribunal without more.\n\nR-RPHB, para. 104.\n\n121.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, there is no doubt that the Claimants suffered some damage caused by the Respondent\u2019s violations of the BIT. The difficulty in this case arises from the quantification of the monetary damages required from the Respondent to compensate the Claimants. The existence of such a difficulty, even in an extreme form, provides no justification in refusing any compensation to an innocent party, leaving the wrongful party with the fruits of its wrongdoing. Tribunals have traditionally resolved such difficulties applying a rule of reason, rather than a rule requiring absolute certainty in calculating compensation.\n\n122.\n\nAs the tribunal decided in *Sistem v. Kyrgyz Republic.72*\n\n*154. The Tribunal is conscious of the desirability for conceptual clarity in valuing assets for the purposes of calculating compensation payable; and it is conscious of the criticism of \u2018triangulation\u2019 methods, which select a figure that lies somewhere in the middle ground of estimates put forward by the parties.*\n\n*155. The Tribunal is also aware of the fact that all valuations in the absence of an actual sale are estimates, and is mindful of the fact that the Tribunal has a legal duty to render an award under a process which the Respondent has freely agreed to establish and the Claimant has freely chosen to pursue, and to do so on the basis of the material that the parties have decided to put before it. That is, necessarily, an exercise in the art of the possible; and the Tribunal has sought to arrive at a rational and fair estimate, in accordance with the BIT, of the loss sustained by the Claimant rather than to engage in a search for the chimera of a sum that is a uniquely and indisputably correct determination of the value of what the Claimant lost. The Tribunal derives some comfort from Immanuel Kant's observation that 'Out of the crooked timber of humanity no straight thing was ever made.'73*\n\n*Sistem Miihendislik Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. v. Kyrgyz Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/06/l), Award of (9 September 2009), paras. 154 and 155.\n\nIn the original German: *\"Aus so krummem Holze, als woraus der Mensch gemacht ist, kann nichts ganz Gerades gezimmert werden. \"*\n\n123.\n\nIn ADC *v. Hungary,* the tribunal likewise decided that:\n\n*the assessment of damages is not a science. True it is that the experts use a variety of methodologies and tools in order to attempt to arrive at the correct figure. But at the end of the day, the Tribunal can stand back and look at the work product and arrive at a figure with which it is comfortable in all the circumstances of the case.74*\n\n*ADC Affiliate Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16), Award (2 October 2006), para. 521\n\n124.\n\nUnder international law, there is thus by now a well-established and well-known *jurisprudence constante* to the effect that, however difficult, an international tribunal must do its best to quantify a loss provided that it is satisfied that some loss has been caused to the claimant by the wrongdoing of the respondent. The alternative of simply dismissing the claim for want of sufficient proof is not regarded as a fair or appropriate result. Almost invariably, this approach requires the tribunal to reject the full extent of the parties\u2019 primary cases on quantum and their expert witnesses\u2019 methodologies. For tactical reasons, a claimant may not wish to discount downwards the full amount of its pleaded claim; and a respondent similarly may not wish to offer a result resulting in any damages being awarded in the claimant\u2019s favour. In the absence of any principle akin to \"baseball arbitration\" (as is absent in this case), the tribunal must then work by itself in the rational middle ground left vacant by the parties and their expert witnesses, as best it can.\n\n125.\n\nThe Tribunal recalls that Article 4(4) of the BIT provides *in fine* that:\n\n*...In case that the effective and fair market value cannot be easily ascertained, the compensation shall be determined on equitable objective principles taking into account, inter alia, the capital invested, its appreciation or depreciation[,] current returns, replacement value and any other relevant factors.*\n\n126.\n\nConsequently, where the effective and fair market value cannot be easily ascertained (as in the present case), the Tribunal must look to \"equitable objective principles\" to establish the compensation to which the Claimants are entitled. In the application of those principles, Article 4(4) of the BIT next requires the Tribunal, as a non-exhaustive list of factors, to take into account \"the capital invested, its appreciation or depreciation[\u2026] current returns, replacement value and other relevant factors.\"\n\n127.\n\n***The Capital Invested.*** The Tribunal will first focus on the factor of \"capital invested\" under Article 4(4) of the BIT. The Tribunal finds that, as the Parties do not dispute, the Claimants paid [...] to purchase [...]% of Socomet\u2019s shares.\n\n128.\n\nThe Tribunal next considers other capital allegedly invested by the Claimants as listed in Exhibit C-61; namely, first, the loan amounts made by the Claimants [...], including personal guarantees that were connected to the Claimants\u2019 investment.\n\n129.\n\nThe Tribunal rejects the Respondent\u2019s arguments that strict evidence of actual contemporaneous payment must be provided by the Claimants.75 The Tribunal considers that a reasonable probability that payment was made is sufficient. The Tribunal finds that the figures provided in Exhibit C-61 are sufficiently established for its decision. Also, in making its decision, the Tribunal uses the figures in Exhibit C-61 without deducting bank expenses.\n\nR-PHB, para. 84. *See also* R-RPHB, para. 44. The Respondent\u2019s arguments this regard are also summarized below at paras. 245 and 246.\n\n130.\n\nThis leads the Tribunal to find the following figures as \"capital invested\" from Exhibit 61, in addition to the share price of [...] :\n\n[...]\n\n131.\n\n***The Holdeast Credit.*** It is necessary to examine the Parties\u2019 respective submissions and the factual materials in evidence in some detail as to this alleged investment by the Claimants in the sum of [...].\n\n132.\n\n*The Parties\u2019 Submissions:*\n\n[...]\n\n140.\n\n*The Factual Evidence:* Mr Marco Gavazzi testified (as did Mr Stefano Gavazzi in similar terms) in his written witness statement:\n\n[...]\n\n141.\n\nMr Marco Gavazzi does not here explain how a credit due from the Company to Holdeast became a credit from the Company to the Claimants.\n\n142.\n\nIn his oral testimony at the first hearing on jurisdiction and liability, Mr Marco Gavazzi testified as follows:\n\n[...]\n\n(Mr Marco Gavazzi and Mr Stefano Gavazzi were not specifically cross-examined by the Respondent on this part of their testimony).\n\n143.\n\nMr Mugnai in his written witness statement testified (as personal consultant to Mr Stefano Gavazzi, at the relevant time):\n\n[...]\n\n144.\n\nMr Mugnai does not here identify the meeting of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors that \"unanimously\" approved the Company\u2019s acknowledgement of the said credits.\n\n145.\n\nIn his oral testimony at the first hearing on jurisdiction and liability, Mr Mugnai testified as follows:\n\n[...]\n\n146.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that Mr Mugnai\u2019s recollection is here somewhat general.\n\n147.\n\nMs Viorica Tataru in her second witness statement testified (as, at the relevant time, an Expert and Head of Service of the Respondent\u2019s Authority for the Administration of State Assets, also known as \"AAAS\"), as translated into English:\n\n[...]\n\n(Ms Tataru was not specifically cross-examined by the Claimants on this part of her written testimony.)76\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Liability Transcript, 5 June 2014, pp. 718-768.\n\n148.\n\nThese conflicting accounts from the Parties\u2019 factual witnesses, coupled with the feature that it comprises, on any view, a complicated chronology of events taking place a long time ago, induce the Tribunal to examine, in some detail from 1999 to 2002, the minutes of the Company\u2019s Board of Directors and its shareholders\u2019 special and general assemblies in regard to this alleged investment by the Claimants. In the Tribunal\u2019s view, these contemporary documents, seen by and known to both the Claimants and others adverse to the Claimants at the time, constitute the most reliable factual evidence regarding the decisive factual issues. The Tribunal recognises that the legal burden of proof rests on the Claimants to prove their factual case.\n\n149.\n\n*The Minutes:* The minutes of the Company\u2019s Board meeting on 9 July 1999 record the following, as translated into English:\n\n150.\n\nOn 14 September 1999,\n\n[...]\n\n151.\n\nThe minutes of the Board meeting on 7 October 1999 state that the Company\u2019s extraordinary general assembly of shareholders was informed that [...].77 Mr Stefano Gavazzi, [...], is requested to provide SIF Banat Crisana, a shareholder, [...].\n\nC-25, as translated into English, p. 45.\n\n152.\n\nThe minutes of the Company\u2019s Board meeting on 21 March 2000, attended by *(inter alios)* Mr Stefano Gavazzi (president and director), Mr Marco Gavazzi (director) and Mr Florian Frumosu note that, as of that date:\n\n[...]\n\n153.\n\nMoreover, the minutes record that Mr Marco Gavazzi informed the Board that the negotiations with SIMEST in view of investing in Eastern Europe were advanced and the financial plan at issue involved the sale of Holdeast credits in Gavazzi Steel to a new Italian holding company which would use such credits to increase the capital of Gavazzi Steel. According to Mr Marco Gavazzi, the capital transaction would be supported by a longterm loan of several million dollars granted by [...] to the new Italian holding, and that amount would be used for a subsequent capital increase of [...]. On questioning at the same Board meeting, Mr Baghina explained that the Holdeast invoices referred to technology projects over a five-year plan, including the improvement of electrical furnaces and onsite technical checks. Mr Baghina noted that the documentation had been subject to independent external expert appraisal, and would additionally be available for inspection by interested parties.78\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n154.\n\nThe minutes of the Company\u2019s general assembly of shareholders on 23 November 2000 report that the shareholders unanimously, with the approval of auditor Mariana Dumitrescu, mandated Mr Stefano Gavazzi to request the judge administering the liquidation of Easteel to take into account:\n\n[...]\n\n155.\n\nThe minutes of 4 October 2001 report that the Company\u2019s Board meeting decided to proceed to the registration of the entire debt of [...] as soon as the Resita tribunal issues a final decision regarding the liquidation of Easteel.79\n\n*- Id.,* p. 87.\n\n156.\n\nThe minutes of the Company\u2019s Board meeting on 1 February 2002 state that Mr Stefano Gavazzi and Mr Marco Gavazzi were willing to waive the [...]claim, they acquired from Holdeast to be transferred to SOCOMET\u2019s capital. However, the final judgment on the liquidation of Easteel and the auditor\u2019s report, regarding the transfer of Easteel\u2019s claim to Holdeast and the Claimants, were at the time not yet established.80\n\nId.,p. 93: [...]\n\n157.\n\nThe minutes of the Company\u2019s general assembly of shareholders also on 1 February 2002 record that, in relation to the issue of [...],81 that Mr Stefano Gavazzi, as Chairman, mentioned first, the personal obligation undertaken by himself and Mr Marco Gavazzi with APAPS upon the execution of the privatization agreement regarding the first instalment of capital increase by [... ]; secondly, the balance sheet registered a debt owed by the company to Holdeast (which was undergoing liquidation), as a result of the liquidation of the joint venture Easteel; and thirdly, that he and Mr Marco Gavazzi were willing to waive the [... ] debt owed to them, which would be transferred to the Company\u2019s capital.82\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nC-25, as translated into English.\n\n158.\n\nThe minutes of the Company\u2019s Board meeting on 21 March 2002 stated that the invoices issued by [...], and owned by the Gavazzi brothers were uncertain as they had not been registered in the accounting books. The Board decided to appoint a person to handle the receipt of such invoices for registration, and to establish a date for a General Meeting of Shareholders that would acknowledge the capital increase of the Company by [...]. The minutes further noted explicitly that the Board postponed the acknowledgement of the capital increase until the next meeting, so as to allow for time to put the accounting documentation in order.83\n\nC-36, as translated into English.\n\n159.\n\nThe minutes of the Company\u2019s general assembly of shareholders on 30 April 2002 stated that the debt of [... ] (which had been erroneously registered in the Socomet books as a debt owed to [...]) was actually owed to Holdeast, a company that was owned by the Gavazzi brothers, who wished to transfer such debt, subsequent to the rectification of the accounting records, to the capital of company Gavazzi Steel. The accounting records were accordingly rectified to show that the credit holder was Holdeast, rather than [...]. The meeting also decided that the:\n\n[...]\n\n160.\n\nThe minutes of the Company\u2019s general assembly of shareholders on 18 June 2002 record that the attendees were informed by the Company\u2019s auditors that [...] was owed as a debt to Holdeast, corresponding to the period preceding its privatization, and that Mr Marco Gavazzi agreed that such amount would be transferred to the capital for the Company.84\n\n*Id.*\n\n161.\n\nAt the Company\u2019s Board meeting on 24 August 2002, the materials related to the Holdeast invoices were accepted. However, Messrs Ioja and Mitariu dissented. The latter attached the following \"appeal\" to the Minutes of the meeting:\n\n[...]\n\n162.\n\nIt will be recalled that, as at this date (24 August 2002), the Company\u2019s Board of Directors considered the Company to be virtually insolvent, requiring a judicial reorganisation under Romanian law and facing claims to such effect from its creditors before the Tribunal of Resita.85\n\nDecision, para. 76.\n\n163.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that this recital of Board meetings and shareholder assemblies tells its own story.\n\n164.\n\nIt is clear that the credit owned by the Claimants came from a third person (Holdeast), juridically unrelated to the Company and originally pre-dating the Claimants\u2019 acquisition of the Company\u2019s shares upon its privatisation. Accordingly, this is not a case of a credit or loan or other form of financing made by the Claimants direct to the Company prior to or at the time of their original investment. The Tribunal accepts that the Claimants subsequently held a credit (as acquired from Holdeast) from the Company; and that the Claimants intended to transfer that credit for the benefit of the Company, as a contribution to its capital and, thereby, as part of their investment in the Company. However, a capital contribution in the form of a transfer of credit from the Claimants to the Company could not be made by means of a unilateral act by the Claimants alone. Something more was required from the side of the Company.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal considers two issues to be decisive in the complicated series of events relating to Holdeast: (i) The Claimants bear the legal burden of proof; and (ii) There is no evidence of any actual increase of capital in the Company. In short, the Claimants have not proven their case.\n\n166.\n\nAs stated above, the Claimants bear the legal burden of proof. To this Tribunal, this means that their claim should be at least more probable than not.\n\n167.\n\nThere is no evidence of any actual increase in capital. The Tribunal notes that a company\u2019s capital is a legal and institutional matter. It is important *erga omnes* because the amount of a company\u2019s capital affects its credit-worthiness and financial standing. For example, when a company\u2019s assets are less than its capital, there are rules about its dissolution. A company\u2019s capital cannot therefore be increased by a mere resolution of the Board or General Assembly. It can only increase its capital after complying with the relevant formalities, ***i.e.,*** registration, act by public notary, amendment of its by-laws or act of incorporation.\n\n168.\n\nIn the case of a Romanian company, such as the Company, Romanian domestic law applies. The Tribunal found in its Decision that Romanian legal formalities for contribution to capital need not be followed in order for a finding that there was an \"investment\" under the BIT. However, the Tribunal considers that there is a difference between the requirements for \"investment\" and for \"capital increase\". Where these formalities are irrelevant to make an \"investment\" as defined under the BIT, they still need to be followed to increase the corporate capital of a Romanian company.\n\n169.\n\nThe Claimants announced their intention to increase the Company\u2019s capital in 1999. However, there is no evidence that such capital was ever increased and, in particular, registered in the Company\u2019s records after the required formalities under Romanian law.\n\n170.\n\nFrom the appeal made by Mr Mitariu on 24 August 2002, there is no evidence that any increase in capital was registered in the Company\u2019s records after the required formalities. The Tribunal finds that the registration and requirements were never completed, despite the Claimants\u2019 attempts to do so. This accords with the oral testimony of Mr Marco Gavazzi, cited above: \"But I didn't succeed.\" The Tribunal thus finds that there was never any actual increase in capital of the Company.\n\n171.\n\nAccordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have not proven their case that their investments, within the meaning of Articles 1 (1)(b) and 4(4) of the BIT and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, included a capital increase in the form of a conversion of a Company debt in any amount, including the alleged amount of [...]\n\n172.\n\n***The Italian Expert Technicians:*** It is again necessary to examine the Parties\u2019 respective submissions and the factual materials in evidence in some detail in regard to this alleged investment of [...].\n\n173.\n\n*The Claimants\u2019 Position:*\n\n[...]\n\n184.\n\n*The Respondent\u2019s Position:*\n\n[...]\n\n186.\n\n*The Tribunal\u2019s Decision:* The Tribunal will successively discuss (i) The evidence to sustain the Claimants\u2019 claim for [...]; and (ii) The relevance of the payment of salaries outside of Romania.\n\nThe Evidence\n------------\n\n187.\n\nIn brief, for the Tribunal, the evidence as to how much money Messrs Gavazzi paid to these Italian expert technicians is at best unclear. Questions abound: for example, to which extent are the 1999 payments included in the 2002 bank statement of [...]? How does this 2002 bank statement relate to the claim that Gavazzi Steel Consultants paid more than [...] to the Italian expert technicians?\n\n188.\n\nThere is no doubt that certain of the Italian consultants, formally in the employment of Gavazzi Steel Consultants, worked for the benefit of the Company, five of them on a permanent basis in Otelu Rosu. However, the only contemporary written proof is the list appended to Exhibit C-63, dated 26 December 1999, of the twelve names and projected annual salary amounts of these experts for the years to come. On the basis of this document, the Claimants have advanced a lump sum of [...] allegedly paid out to these twelve technicians, without providing the Tribunal with any breakdown of how much, when and how each of the twelve technicians were paid. On the other hand, Exhibit C-62 refers to [...]. No evidence has been submitted by the Claimants to show how much of the money thus received was actually paid out to these Italian expert technicians and was not used for Gavazzi Steel Consultants to finance other activities. Indeed, at the hearing, Mr Marco Gavazzi admitted that Gavazzi Steel Consultants used funds received by Gavazzi Steel Consultants not only to pay salaries: [...,]86\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Liability Transcript, 3 June 2014, 364, 25; p. 365, 1-3 (Marco Gavazzi).\n\n189.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that Gavazzi Steel Consultants appears to have been initially intended to act as Socomet\u2019s international agent, operating on a [...]% commission, to sell Socomet\u2019s products abroad to increase to maximum the profitability of its marketing operations. For instance, by 7 October 1999, important sales agreements had already been concluded. Moreover, Gavazzi Steel Consultants was also intended to purchase, for its principal, raw materials and equipment. The Tribunal observes that in the Minutes of the initial Board and Shareholders meetings, only this agency and marketing function of Gavazzi Steel Consultants were mentioned; there was no mention that Gavazzi Steel Consultants was intended as a conduit to pay the Italian technicians their salary in Switzerland.87 It was only on 1 February 2002, after Socomet had acquired the shares of Gavazzi Steel Consultants, that the Minutes of the Board Meeting indicated that Gavazzi Steel Consultants would not only market Socomet\u2019s products outside of Romania but would also cover [...].88 Similarly, the Minutes of the General Assembly of Shareholders of the same day describe [...].89 Moreover, the Minutes state, [...].90 The several functions of Gavazzi Steel Consultants contradict the notion that all funds invested in that Company were exclusively related to payment of the salaries of the Italian technicians. The Tribunal finds that this clearly not so.\n\n*See e.g.,* [...]C-36, as translated into English, and [...], C-25, as translated into English.\n\nC-36, as translated into English, p. 94.\n\nC-25, as translated into English, p. 75.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n190.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 submissions and evidence in relation to why [...] should have been due, are very succinct. There are four lines in its Second Submission at paragraph 101, and a mere reference in its Reply on Quantum. On the other hand, the Respondent has extensively pointed to a lack of evidence supporting the Claimants\u2019 claim of [...] in this regard.91\n\nR-PHB, paras. 17-24; R-RPHB, paras. 44-46; R-CMQ, paras. 179-181.\n\n191.\n\nThis lack of evidence is all the more striking as Gavazzi Steel Consultants was directly and fully controlled by the Claimants until February 2002, and indirectly through Socomet after that date. The Tribunal is willing to assume that the Claimants always had intended to request Socomet to reimburse them for the funds that the Claimants had invested in Socomet through Gavazzi Steel Consultants. However, if that assumption were correct, it can be expected that the Claimants would have kept careful financial records of what sums they considered to be due to them. Bearing in mind that the Claimants appear to have saved copies of all Socomet documentation, and submitted many of these documents into evidence in this case, the Tribunal cannot but wonder why the Claimants were unable to do the same for Gavazzi Steel Consultants. It can only assume that none existed.\n\nRomanian Taxes\n--------------\n\n192.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Claimants cannot claim compensation for the payment of salaries to the Italian technicians working permanently at Otelu Rosu, who were paid in Lugano, Switzerland, when they returned via Switzerland to Italy. The Claimants admitted that these payments [...].92 Moreover, at the hearing, it was admitted that the payment were in breach of Romanian tax regulations.93\n\n*See* C-SSQ, fn. 101.\n\n*See* Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability Transcript, 3 June 2014, p. 379 19-21; as referred to by Respondent, R-CMQ, para. 179.\n\n193.\n\nThe Tribunal will now discuss the possible illegality of the payments that had been made to the Italian expert technicians in light of Article 1.1 of the BIT which requires an investment to be \"in accordance with its (Romanian) laws\".\n\n194.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that the Respondent focuses its argument about the illegality of the salaries paid to the five technicians who were allegedly active in Otelu Rosu on a permanent basis, but did not argue that the salaries paid to the other Italians, [...], who were consulting on a non-permanent basis, were also illegal under Romanian law. Any violation of Romanian domestic laws as regards the employment of foreign personnel and tax applied only to the five technicians who worked on-site, as opposed to all twelve of the Italian expert technicians.\n\n195.\n\nThe Tribunal has to address the Claimants\u2019 allegation that the Romanian authorities were aware of the fact that these five technicians received their salaries outside of Romania and that the National Bank of Romania had approved that mode of operation. It observes that Mr Marco Gavazzi\u2019s statement at the hearing that he [...]\" [...] is not sustained on the contemporary documentation. In fact, the Tribunal observes that, immediately after the Claimants entered the Socomet Board of Directors, it was decided to solicit from the Romanian National Bank the required authorisation to transfer funds abroad to acquire Gavazzi Steel Consultants BVI.94 However, at that time, Gavazzi Steel Consultants was still being presented as Socomet\u2019s international agent: operating on a [...]% commission, it would sell Socomet\u2019s products abroad, purchase raw material and equipment and provide technical assistance for equipment delivered.95 At the General Assembly of Shareholders of 7 October 1999, Gavazzi Steel Consultants was said \"[...]\"96 No mention was made of the use of Gavazzi Steel Consultants as a serving hatch to pay permanently the Italian technicians working at Otelu Rosu. This other activity of Gavazzi Steel Consultants was only acknowledged much later, *i.e.,* on 1 February 2002, in the Board of Directors and the General Assembly of Shareholders.97 In fact, the authorization that the Romanian National Bank issued in November 1999, on which Claimants rely, did not acknowledge that Gavazzi Steel Consultants would systematically be used to pay the Italian technicians; its scope only covered the transfer of funds for the purchase of Gavazzi Steel Consultants.98 Consequently, the Tribunal is not convinced by the Claimants\u2019 argument that the payment of salaries outside of Romania was expressly approved by the Romanian authorities.\n\n[...] C-36, as translated into English.\n\nC-36, as translated into English, p. 9.\n\nC-25, as translated into English, p. 44.\n\n*See* C-25, as translated into English, p. 75 and C-36, as translated into English, p. 94.\n\nC-64.\n\n196.\n\nThe Tribunal is aware that the Claimants argue that the Italian experts needed to be paid outside of Romania because Socomet\u2019s Romanian bank accounts had been unlawfully blocked by the Romanian authorities, making any direct payments by the Company to the Italian expert technicians impossible. The argument, made by the Respondent, that such payment is illegal under Romanian law and therefore non-compensable under the BIT for reasons of illegality, must be tempered by the fact that such breach of Romanian law was provoked by the Respondent\u2019s own breach of its commitments under the BIT.\n\n197.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that these bank accounts were only blocked as of 15 September 1999, whereas the Claimants themselves admitted that it had been their intention from the very beginning to pay the Italian consultants in convertible currency outside Romania. As Mr Marco Gavazzi confirmed at the hearing: \"[...]\".99 Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that the payment of salaries outside of Romania was not initially caused by the Respondent\u2019s blocking of the Company\u2019s Romanian bank accounts.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction and Liability Transcript, 3 June 2014, p.354, 15-16.\n\n198.\n\nHowever, as the Tribunal considers that the Claimants failed to substantiate the quantum of their claim for compensation of monies paid to the Italian consultants, the issue relating to the extent to which the fact that the payment of salaries outside of Romania to some or all Italian Consultants, becomes irrelevant in deciding this claim. The Tribunal does not therefore base its decision on this part of the Respondent\u2019s case.\n\n***iv. Loss of Opportunity***\n-----------------------------\n\n199.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, it would be wrong in this case as a matter of principle to limit the Claimants\u2019 compensation to the return of its capital invested (with interest) under Article 4(4) of the BIT. First, where (as here) the effective and fair market value of the Claimants\u2019 shares in the company cannot be easily ascertained, that provision requires the Tribunal to apply, above all, \"equitable objective principles\". Second, the same provision lists factors which are expressly stated not to be exhaustive *(\"inter alia\").* Last, but not least, the latter list includes a \u2018catch-all\u2019 reference to \"other relevant factors\".\n\n200.\n\nApplying all this to the present case, it is a fact of commercial life and international trade that investors do not do something for nothing. It would thus make no sense to limit the Claimants\u2019 compensation in this case to capital invested. There is also another general principle at issue, common to all claims for compensation. As the tribunal held in *Himpurnia.*\n\n*291. Here the claimant seeks the benefit of its bargain. This is a fundamental aspect of the law of contracts; if recovery were limited to what a claimant has spent in reliance on a contract which has been breached, an incentive would be created which is contrary to contractual morality: obligors would generally find it in their interest to breach contracts which turn out to be valuable to their co-contractant. Parties do not enter into contracts involving risk in order to be repaid their costs.**To limit the recovery of the victim of a breach to its actual expenditures is to transform it into a lender, which is commercially intolerable when that party was at full risk for the amount of investments made on the strength of the contract.100*\n\n*Himpurnna v. PT (Persero) Perusahaan Listruik Negara,* Yearbook Comm Arb\u2019n XXV (2000) 13, pp. 83-84, Final Award (4 May 1999). This was a claim in contract under a national law, but the same general principle applies to an analogous claim for compensation under a treaty under international law.\n\n201.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the other factors listed in Article 4(4) of the BIT, that is, the appreciation and depreciation of the capital invested, current returns and replacement value, are not relevant on the factual circumstances of this case. The Tribunal therefore next considers together \"equitable objective principles\" and the catch-all reference to \"any other relevant factors\". In the Tribunal\u2019s view, the most relevant factor is the Claimants\u2019 \"loss of opportunity\" to benefit from its capital invested.\n\n*a.* *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*b.* *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*c.* *The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n209.\n\nThe Tribunal is conscious of the Parties\u2019 reluctance, based on their different perspectives, to accept any approach by the Tribunal to use loss of opportunity as a basis for its assessment of compensation under Article 4(4) of the BIT.101 Despite the Parties\u2019 common reluctance, having given them both a fair opportunity to address the issue, the Tribunal considers that, in this case, it has a duty to adopt that approach, as explained further below.\n\nC-PHB, paras. 205-218; R-PHB, paras.135-148.\n\n210.\n\nIn international investment arbitration, where arbitrators have to apply international investment treaties and general principles of international law, because of the international law dimension and issues in which the public has a stake, the principle of *iura novit curia* has even a more substantial impact than in international commercial arbitration.102 The parties have no veto right on the international legal principles to be applied. The Tribunal can reach its legal reasoning on the outcome of the case independently from the legal theories defended by the parties as long as it has submitted the legal theories for comments to the Parties in a fair and appropriate manner. Indeed, the Tribunal can \"come to an appropriate legal resolution of the dispute once it understands the relevant facts\".103\n\n*See e.g.* H. van Houtte and M.

The reason of this annulment was the circumstance that, apparently, the tribunal had not submitted the possibility to grant damages for loss of such opportunity to the parties which, on the contrary - this Tribunal has here done expressly.111 It is also clear from earlier decisions of the French Cour de Cassation that French law recognizes the concept of compensation for loss of opportunity (or loss of a chance).112\n\n*See.e.g.,* H. Mazeaud, L. Mazeaud and A. Tunc, *Trait\u00e9 Th\u00e9orique et Pratique de la Responsabilit\u00e9 Civile D\u00e9lictuelle et Contractuelle - Volume I,* (6th ed., Montchrestian: 1965) at p. 272 et seq; P. le Tourneau and L. Cadiet, *Droit de la Responsabilit\u00e9* (Dalloz: 1998) at p. 214; and G. M\u00e0sch, *Chance und Schaden* (Mohr Siebeck: 2004), at p. 240 *et seq.* and p. 320 *et seq.*\n\nFor example, the Court of Appeal in England decided to award such damages in *Chaplin v. Hicks* [1911] 2 KB 786, where the plaintiff was wrongly deprived of an opportunity, in breach of contract, to win a beauty competition leading to employment as an actress. The jury could not award her damages on the basis that she would have won the competition because she was only one of 50 competitors from which only 12 winners could be chosen; but she was nonetheless awarded substantial damages (\u00a3100, now equivalent to about \u00a310,000). On the defendant\u2019s unsuccessful appeal, the Court of Appeal emphasised that it remained legally possible to quantify the plaintiff s damages, on a balance of probabilities under English law, even though her claim remained subject to future contingencies making that exercise \"not only difficult but incapable of being carried out with certainty or precision\"; and the Court rejected the notion \"with emphasis\" that, because such precision was not possible, then no damages could be ordered at all.\n\n*OMI* v. *CCN* (arr\u00eat of 29 June 2011). The tribunal\u2019s majority comprised both civilian and common lawyers (Horacio GrigeraNaon and Jan Paulsson); the claimant\u2019s counsel included a common lawyer (Toby Landau) and the applicable law was a civilian system. The case is reported online at:https://www.courdecassation.fr/jurisprudence\\_2/premiere\\_chambre\\_civile\\_568/785\\_29\\_20477.html, where it was held that *\"que la cour d\u2019appel en a d\u00e9duit \u00e0 bon droit qu \u2019en omettant d\u2019inviter les parties \u00e0 s\u2019expliquer sur ce point, les arbitres avaient m\u00e9connu le principe de la contradiction\".*\n\nFor example, see the judgment of the Cour de cassation of 18 March 1975, in the *de la Broise Case,* quashing the judgment of the Cour d\u2019appel of Angers: \"*... Attendu d'autre part qu'en se bornant \u00e0 \u00e9noncer qu 'il n '\u00e9tait pas certain que la victime e\u00fbt obtenu la promotion qu 'elle pouvait esp\u00e9rer, l'arr\u00eat n 'a pas justifi\u00e9 le rejet de la pr\u00e9tention des parties civiles qui invoquaient la perte d'une chance; qu'en effet, l'\u00e9l\u00e9ment de pr\u00e9judice constitu\u00e9 par la perte d'une chance peut pr\u00e9senter en lui-m\u00eame un caract\u00e8re direct et certain chaque fois qu'est constat\u00e9e la disparition, par l'effet du d\u00e9lit, de la probabilit\u00e9 d'un \u00e9v\u00e9nement favorable, encore que, par d\u00e9finition, la r\u00e9alisation d'une chance ne soit jamais certaine;...\"*\n\n214.\n\nThe principle of \"loss of opportunity\" as a basis for compensation, in a comparative approach, is best illustrated by the UNIDROIT Principles on International Commercial Contracts (2004, since immaterially revised). Article 7.4.3 (Certainty of Harm) provides:\n\n*(1) Compensation is due only for harm, including future harm, that is established with a reasonable degree of certainty.*\n\n*(2) Compensation may be due for the loss of a chance in proportion to the probability of its occurrence.*\n\n*(3) Where the amount of damages cannot be established with a sufficient degree of certainty, the assessment is at the discretion of the court.*\n\n215.\n\nAs regards the second sub-paragraph, the UNIDROIT commentary reads:\n\n*Para. (2) in addition covers loss of a chance, obviously only in proportion to the probability of its occurrence: thus, the owner of a horse which arrives too late to run in a race as a result of delay in transport cannot recover the whole of the prize money, even though the horse was the favourite.*\n\n216.\n\nAs regards the third sub-paragraph, the commentary reads:\n\n*... where the amount of damages cannot be established with a sufficient degree of certainty then, rather than refuse any compensation or award nominal damages, the court is empowered to make an equitable quantification of the harm sustained.*\n\n217.\n\nRipinsky & Williams summarized the principle as to loss of opportunity in regard to future profits as follows:\n\n*Where a tribunal cannot accept a claim for lost profits as not sufficiently certain, it may choose to award, instead, a compensation for the loss of business (commercial) opportunity, or for the loss of a chance. This head of damage appears to be a subspecies of lost profits, which is resorted to when the available data does not allow**making a more precise calculation of lost profits. The concept of the loss of opportunity, or the loss of a chance, is recognised in a number of national legal systems, as well as in the UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts. The latter provide in Article 7.4.3 (2) that \u2018[c]ompensation may be due for the loss of a chance in proportion to the probability of its occurrence \u2019. It is suggested that a chance of making a profit is an asset with a value of its own, and that compensation for the loss of a chance is an alternative to the award of lost profits proper in cases where the claimant has failed to prove the amount of the alleged loss of profit with the required degree of certainty, but where the tribunal was satisfied that the loss in fact occurred. Loss of a chance can thus be used as a tool allowing the injured party to receive some form of compensation for the loss of a chance to make a profit. In theory, the loss of a chance is assessed by reference to the degree of probability of the chance turning out in the plaintiff\u2019s favour, although in practice the amount awarded on this account is often discretionary.113*\n\nRipinsky & Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law* (2008), p. 291 (footnotes omitted).\n\n218.\n\nIn international law the concept of \"loss of opportunity\" has long been accepted. It suffices here to refer to the decisions in *Sapphire v. NIOC,114* (albeit arguably influenced by *ex aequo et bono* considerations); *SPP v. Egypt,115 Gemplus v. Mexico116* and *Lemire v. Ukraine.117* Given the Parties\u2019 common reluctance to accept or deploy this \u2018jurisprudence constante\u2019, the relevant passages from two of these decisions merit citing here at length.\n\n*Sapphire International Petroleums Ltd. v.

Ukraine* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18) Award (28 March 2011) (hereinafter *\"Lemire v. Ukraine\"),* paras. 246-251.\n\n219.\n\nThe ICSID tribunal *in SPP v. Egypt* declined to award compensation by reference to any DCF methodologies because the project was in its infancy with an insufficient history on which to base projected revenues into the future (as already described above). Instead, the tribunal awarded compensation for the claimant\u2019s loss of opportunity to make a commercial success of the project in the sum of [...]. The tribunal decided that it was incontestable on the evidential record that the claimants\u2019 investment had a value that exceeded their out-of-pocket expenses. The tribunal acknowledged that determining the \"opportunity of making a commercial success of the project\" necessarily involved an element of subjectivism and, consequently some uncertainty; however, it stated that \"it is well settled that the fact that damages cannot be assessed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when a loss has been incurred\".118\n\n*SPP v. Egypt,* para. 212ff.\n\n220.\n\nThe *SPP* tribunal then proceeded to calculate such compensation as follows:\n\n*216. In determining the amount by which the value of the Claimants\u2019 investment in ETDC exceeded their out-of-pocket expenses, the Tribunal will take as a starting point the lot sales actually made during the short life of the project and the revenues to be imputed to those sales. As the Tribunal has already observed, the evidence shows that during the period February 1977 to May 1978, ETDC\u2019s actual sales of villa and multi-family sites amounted to US $10,211,000. The lots involved - 383 villa sites and 3 multi-family sites represented only 6 percent of the villa sites and less than 1 percent of the multi-family sites with respect to which ETDC held rights.**It is clear, therefore, that the remaining lots were a potential source of very substantial revenues.*\n\n*217. The Tribunal will next consider what it took in the way of expenditures by the Claimants to generate the revenues imputed to the lot sales. The difference between these expenditures and the portion of imputed revenues corresponding to SPP(ME) \u2019s shareholding in ETDC is, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the minimum measure of the value to be ascribed to the opportunity to make a commercial success of the project.*\n\n*218. It is not disputed that SPP(ME) made capital contributions to ETDC of US $1,310,000, and the Tribunal has already determined that the Claimants\u2019 development costs were US $1,719,000. In addition, loans totalling US $2,058,000 were made to ETDC, but these loans will be disregarded for present purposes because they were intended to be reimbursed - for the most part with interest at commercial rates. The portion of the revenues imputed to the lot sales corresponding to SPP(ME) \u2019s shareholding in ETDC was 60 percent of US $10,211,000, or US $6,127,000. Thus, the portion of the sales revenues corresponding to SPP (ME) \u2019s shareholding in ETDC would have exceeded the Claimants\u2019 non-reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses by US $3,098,000. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that the value of which the Claimants have called the \"opportunity of making a commercial success of the project\" was not less than US $3,098,000. Stated differently, the value of the Claimants\u2019 investment in May of 1978 when the project was cancelled exceeded their out-of-pocket expenses by at least US $3,098,000.119*\n\n*SPP v. Egypt,* paras. 216-218.\n\n221.\n\nIn *Lemire v. Ukraine,* the ICSID tribunal adopted a similar approach, recognising that a loss of opportunity could be valued in its own right with sufficient certainty for the purpose of assessing compensation. It decided as follows, adopting the test suggested in the UNIDROIT Principles:\n\n*246. The Tribunal agrees that it is a commonly accepted standard for awarding forward looking compensation that damages must not be speculative or uncertain, but proved with reasonable certainty; the level of certainty is unlikely, however, to be the same with respect to the conclusion that damages have been caused, and the precise quantification of such damages. Once causation has been established, and it has been proven that the* in bonis *party has indeed suffered a loss, less certainty is required in proof of the actual amount of damages; for this latter determination Claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss.*\n\n*247. While the existence of damage is certain, calculating the precise amount of the compensation is fraught with much more difficulty, inherent in the very nature of the \"but for \" hypothesis. Valuation is not an exact science. The Tribunal has no crystal ball and cannot claim to know what would have happened under a hypothesis of no breach; the best any tribunal can do is to make an informed and conscientious evaluation, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, not unlike that made by anyone who assesses the value of a business on the basis of its likely future earnings.*\n\n*[...]*\n\n*251 Compensation for a lost chance is admissible, and is normally calculated as the hypothetical maximum loss, multiplied by the probability of the chance coming to fruition. To take the example given in the Official Comment to the UNIDROIT Principles: \u2018[T]he owner of a horse which arrives too late to run in a race as a result of delay in transport cannot recover the whole prize money, even though the horse was the favourite \u2019. In this example, the owner must be satisfied with compensation proportionate to the probability of the win.120*\n\n*Lemire v. Ukraine,* paras. 246-251 (footnotes omitted).\n\n222.\n\nApplying the principle of loss of opportunity to the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal concludes that it is necessary, under Article 4(4) of the BIT, to quantify, beyond the amount of their capital investment, the loss of opportunity suffered by the Claimants caused by the Respondent\u2019s breaches of the BIT. The Tribunal must of course do so with a reasonable degree of certainty, bearing in mind that the Claimants bear the overall legal burden of proving their loss. The Tribunal must also assess that opportunity in proportion to the probability of the counter-factual situation occurring; namely (as alleged by the Respondent): the complete financial failure of the Claimants\u2019 project caused by factors other than the Respondent\u2019s violations of the BIT.\n\n223.\n\nOf course, the Tribunal is conscious that its calculations of loss of opportunity cannot be a rigorous scientific, mathematical or forensic exercise. However, considering what the international and domestic decisions and commentaries suggest, including the UNIDROIT Principles, and what is actually before the Tribunal in this case as evidence, it is a difficult but not an impossible exercise.\n\n224.\n\nIn assessing compensation for loss of opportunity, the Tribunal notes, potentially, a special factor. The reason why such compensation is so difficult in this case, subject to causation (addressed separately below), lies with the Respondent\u2019s own wrongdoing in violation of the BIT. Where a claimant as the innocent party has difficulty in proving its compensation, particularly as regards future events, because of the wrongdoer\u2019s acts or omissions, the wrongdoer should not be permitted to escape liability for compensation as a direct result of the difficulty or resulting uncertainty for which that wrongdoer is responsible. At that point, the evidential burden regarding uncertainty shifts from the innocent party to the guilty party. Otherwise, the guilty party would profit unfairly from its own wrong.\n\n225.\n\nThe Tribunal next notes that other steel companies in similar situations in Romania, such as Mittal Steel, were successful in turning a profit from their comparable operations in Romania. The same result, in theory, could have happened with Socomet. It is a matter of regret for all concerned that the Claimants\u2019 project failed.\n\n226.\n\nAs already summarised above, the Claimants based their assessment of loss of opportunity on the 2002 Business Plan, which was not implemented. They observe that its expert witnesses (of Deloitte) have estimated the value of Socomet based on the Business Plan as [...] On the other hand, IPROLAM, in a 2004 report to the local court in the Severin case, found that Socomet was mismanaged and needed a far more radical reorganisation than the 2002 Business Plan envisaged- if ever implemented, quod non.121 In a later report of 5 October 2004, IPROLAM considered the take-over by D\u00factil, a well-performing Romanian Steel Mill, of the management of Socomet and substantial streamlining of Socomet\u2019s activities. This report also very briefly mentioned without attaching any conclusion that a \u2018Valuation Report of Gavazzi Steel SA Otelu Rosu, drawn up by economists Onete Bogdan and Arcanu Ungureanu Mihai, had valued Socomet, as a going concern without implementation of the Business Plan as [...] and Socomet\u2019s assets at [...].122 The Claimants argue that under the loss-of-opportunity approach, the difference between Deloitte\u2019s estimate and IPROLAM\u2019s valuation of Socomet would correspond to the value added to the company, had the Business Plan been implemented by the Claimants.123 However, this Valuation Report has not been submitted; and it is unknown to the Tribunal whether it was drafted at the request of Socomet or the Claimants or by independent experts, nor what its assumptions and criteria were. More specifically, the conclusions of the Valuation Report hint that the Report considered the financial status of Socomet, which already had gone through the insolvency process and was freed from all liabilities. Moreover, as the Respondent has pointed out, such a calculation would imply an [...]% granted return on the Claimants\u2019 investment based on the hypothetical implementation of the 2002 Business Plan,124 a granted [...]% return, based upon the unknown Valuation Report as a going concern and even a granted return of [...]% on the basis of asset value after the insolvency and over two year of inactivity. The Tribunal finds these figures wholly unrealistic and, for all practical purposes, unsuitable to quantify the Claimants\u2019 loss of opportunity.\n\n[... ] (R-52; C-57). These valuation numbers were only quoted to suggest that theoretically assets or part of the going concern \u2018outside the viable flow\u2019 could be sold, but without any prognosis at the price to be obtained.\n\nC-57 and R- 52.\n\nC-RPHB, para. 108.\n\nR-RPHB, para. 96.\n\n227.\n\nMoreover, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, the 2002 Business Plan has to be severely discounted as its successful implementation was always improbable. The probability of Socomet\u2019s potential future returns under the 2002 Business Plan raises *inter alia* the following questions:\n\na) Whether the transaction being negotiated with Techint and Simest (the latter, in particular, being premised on many conditions), and HypoVereins Bank (which depended on cooperation with a Romanian bank) could or would materialise;\n\nb) Even if the transaction did materialise, would it be profitable, despite all the variables and uncertainties involved; and\n\nc) Even if were profitable, what would have been the amount of those profits for the company.\n\n228.\n\nFor the reasons already set out earlier in this Award, the Tribunal decides that there was no probability that Socomet would have generated substantial revenues with significant net profits. Therefore, the Claimants\u2019 scenarios ofa[...]%, [...]% or [...]% loss of opportunity, based on the 2002 Business Plan, is simply, in the Tribunal\u2019s view, unrealistic, unreliable and unsuitable for present purposes.\n\n229.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore turns to the only solid data available: the amounts invested by the Claimants and seeks to estimate the probable future return on such investment. This is, again, not an easy exercise.\n\n230.\n\nThe Tribunal can readily accept that international investors, such as the Claimants, could hope to double their investment over time. However, this hope is certainly not established in the present case where there were significant overdue debts and the company, run in Communist times in a manner that had brought it close to bankruptcy, needed a \"radical turn around\".125 In fact, the Claimants\u2019 investment in Socomet was subject to very considerable risks. Hence, what the Claimants might have hoped as a return on their capital invested must be discounted downwards.\n\nC-PHB, para. 116.\n\n231.\n\nIn fact, the impact of the retraction of Romania\u2019s commitments was less dramatic than Claimants argued.126 It was not certain that, without that retraction, Socomet would have become profitable. Moreover, the Claimants did not make much of an investment themselves. The Tribunal notes that, even in their negotiations with Techint and the 2002 Business Plan, it was always envisaged that moneys should have hopefully been injected from third parties such as Techint, Simest, and HypoVereins Bank. If the Claimants had invested the planned amounts of [...] in 1999, [...] in 2001, and the balancing of [...] altogether, Socomet could have had a chance of survival and, perhaps, even success.127\n\nC-SSQ, paras. 51-55.\n\nBesides, in 1999, the Claimants envisaged an investment of approximately [...], a sum far larger than the amounts reflected later in the 2002 Business Plan. The Claimants were thus aware that very substantial funds were necessary to turn Socomet around, and to restructure it as a going concern capable of prospering.\n\n232.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore, by majority, quantifies the Claimants\u2019 loss of opportunity at 50% of the amount of their investment, discounted to and assessed as at 1 September 2002. The Tribunal retained the date of 1 September 2002 as the relevant valuation date as the Board of Directors and General Meeting of Shareholders considered Socomet \"virtually insolvent\" on 24 August 2002 and by end August its judicial reorganisation was applied for. Without resorting to the unreliability of the 2002 Business Plan, or to other possible calculation scenarios for which the Tribunal has no or no sufficient evidence, the Tribunal determines the amount of compensation for the loss of opportunity at 50% of the share price and capital invested by the Claimants; namely:\n\n[...]The Tribunal concludes that its determination of these amounts of compensation conforms to the rule of customary international law set out in Article 36(2) of the International Law Commission\u2019s draft Articles on State Responsibility (2001). These figures are not \"speculative\", but represent the established minimum damage actually suffered by the Claimants and financially assessed as at 1 September 2002.\n\n233.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes this assessment of compensation for loss of opportunity with some observations on the award of 30 October 2007 issued by the arbitral tribunal chaired by Professor Pierre Lalive (\"2007 Romanian Award\"), annulled by the Romanian courts, which had granted the Claimants substantial compensation, significantly greater than the compensation awarded by the Tribunal in this Award.128 This difference requires explanation.\n\n*See* Decision, paras. 77-79.\n\n234.\n\nThe Tribunal first notes that the 2007 Romanian Award was a majority award, deciding on a question of private contract rather than investment under a treaty. Moreover, the award was later annulled by the courts of Romania. The Tribunal also notes that the 2007 Romanian Award did not grant compensation for a loss of opportunity. Instead, the award, in a rather succinct manner, granted compensation for lost profits, thereby relying fully on Deloitte Report. However, the 2007 Romanian Award put into question neither the Kinglor Report, nor the 2002 Business Plan, as the present Tribunal does. Moreover, the 2007 Romanian Award also does not take into account the mismanagement of Socomet, a fact that was extensively discussed by IPROLAM in its Report. For these reasons, this Tribunal finds that it had to part ways with the reasoning in the 2007 Romanian Award.\n\n**D. Article 2(3) - Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n*a.* *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*b.* *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*c.* *The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nIn its endeavours above to apply \"equitable objective principles\", the Tribunal has already decided to compensate the Claimants not only for their lost investments (in the form of capital invested) but also for their loss of opportunity to make a profit from such investments. The Tribunal has also decided that \"the effective and fair market value\" of the Claimants\u2019 shares cannot be ascertained, easily or at all, on the basis of the factual and expert materials placed before the Tribunal.\n\n252.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, the granting of further compensation as claimed by the Claimants for breach of the FET standard would duplicate such compensation notwithstanding the difference in the dates invoked by the Claimants. As shown above, the Claimants sought compensation for the value of Socomet as of 2002, based *(inter alia)* on all the monies that the Claimants put into Socomet between 1999 and 2002. Accordingly, given that the Tribunal has already taken such monies into account, that compensation necessarily precludes the Claimants from claim reimbursement of the same pre-2002 investments which kept Socomet in operation until 2002. The Claimants cannot, as the Belgians say, have their pistolet and eat it, or, as in Ancient Rome: *electa una via, non recursum ad altera.*\n\n253.\n\nAccordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal decides that there are no additional items of loss qualifying as further compensation accruing to the Claimants for the breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard in Article 2(3) of the BIT.\n\n**E. Attribution of Losses**\n----------------------------\n\n*a.* *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*b.* *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*c.* *The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal has found that the Respondent is responsible for breaches of the BIT and has to compensate the Claimants for damage caused thereby. However, the Tribunal is also aware of the Respondent\u2019s arguments that it should not be held responsible for the totality of the damage alleged by the Claimants, since there were various acts and omissions on the part of the Claimants and of Socomet that contributed to Socomet\u2019s insolvency and for which Socomet itself or the Claimants were responsible.129 The Tribunal has therefore to address specifically the Respondent\u2019s argument that the\n\n[...]\n\n*Id.,* paras. 76 and 198.\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal will first focus on the legal question to what extent the Respondent\u2019s obligation to compensate for breach of the BIT is affected by the alleged responsibility of Socomet or the Claimants for acts and omissions which contributed to the Company\u2019s insolvency, in whole or in part. It will then discuss the factual question to what extent the alleged acts and omissions have contributed to the insolvency and, more importantly, whether Socomet or the Claimants can be held responsible for them.\n\n269.\n\nIn international law, where a State has caused damage by a breach of its international obligations, and where the claimant has shown that its losses are sufficiently and reasonably linked to the State\u2019s breach, causation is held to have been established. Other possible concurrent events that are not attributable to the State are irrelevant; such events do not diminish the State\u2019s responsibility, nor do they reduce the amount of compensation for damages due. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the award in *CME v. Czech Republic,* where the tribunal held that:\n\n*[...] a State may be held responsible for injury to an alien investor where it is not the sole cause of the injury; the State is not absolved because of the participation of other tortfeasors in the infliction of the injury....130*\n\n*CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic,* UNCITRAL, Partial Award (13 September 2001) (hereinafter *\"CME v. Czech Republic\"),* para. 580.\n\n270.\n\nThe tribunal in that case relied upon the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (\"ILC Articles\"),131 as well as a study by a highly qualified jurist on the topic of complex liabilities, the latter of which reads:\n\n*It is the very general rule that if a tortfeasor\u2019s behaviour is held to be a cause of the victim\u2019s harm, the tortfeasor is liable to pay for all the harm so caused, notwithstanding that there was a concurrent cause of that harm and that another is responsible for that cause.... In other words, the liability of a tortfeasor is not affected vis-\u00e0-vis the victim by the consideration that another is concurrently liable.132*\n\nAdopted on the second reading, United Nations International Law Commission, 9 August 2001, Article 31 and its Commentary in paras. 9-10 and 12-13.\n\nJ.A. Weir, \"Complex Liabilities\", in A. Tunc (ed.), *International Encyclopedia of Comparative Law, Vol. XI* (Mohr: 1983), at p. 41, quoted by *CME v. Czech Republic,* para. 581.\n\n271.\n\nTherefore, the tribunal in *CME v. Czech Republic* concluded that:\n\n*International practice and the decisions of international tribunals do not support the reduction or attenuation of reparation of concurrent causes, except in cases of contributory fault.133*\n\n*CME* v. *Czech Republic,* para. 583.\n\n272.\n\nThe tribunal in *Stati v. Kazakhstan* took the same stance:\n\n*1330....as reflected in Art. 36 and 39 ILC Articles on State Responsibility, Claimants bear the burden of demonstrating that the claimed quantum of compensation is caused by the host State\u2019s conduct.*\n\n*1331. The Tribunal further agrees with Respondent\u2019s submission that Art 39 of the ILC Articles requires that such conduct be taken into account in determining compensation. Indeed, in investment cases, tribunals have reduced damages by a percentage reflecting the investor\u2019s role in the events leading to a loss.*\n\n*1331. And the Tribunal agrees with Claimants\u2019 that the burden then may shift to the state to prove that an intervening event - such as a factor attributable to the victim or a third party - caused the damage alleged, unless, as the tribunal in* CME v. Czech Republic *explained, the injury can be shown to be severable in causal terms from that attributed to the state.134*\n\n*Anatolie Stati, Gabriel Stati, Ascom Group SA and Terra Raf Trans Traiding Ltd v. Republic of Kazakhstan,* (SCC Case No. V (116/2010)), Award, (19 December 2013) (hereinafter *\"Stati v. Kazakhstan\"),* paras. 1330-1332.\n\n273.\n\nSimilarly, the tribunal in *Gemplus v. Mexico* held:\n\n*Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility precludes full recovery of damages where, through the willful or negligent act or omission of the claimant state or person, that state or person has contributed to the injury for which reparation is sought from the respondent state. The ILC\u2019s Commentary on Article 39 refers to like concepts in national laws referred to as \"contributory negligence \", \"comparative fault\", \"faute de la victime\" etc. The common feature of all these national legal concepts is, of course, a fault by the claimant which has caused or contributed to the injury which is the subject-matter of the claim; and such a fault is synonymous with a form of culpability and not any act or omission falling short of such culpability.135*\n\n*Gemplus v. Mexico,* para. 11.12.\n\n274.\n\nThis Tribunal is of the same opinion and therefore agrees with the Claimants\u2019 submission that:\n\n[...]\n\n275.\n\nThe Tribunal observes that many of these acts and omissions alleged against the Claimants followed closely on the freezing of Socomet\u2019s bank accounts. The closures directly resulted from Socomet\u2019s non-payment of its debts and the additional related penalties for delayed payment. The Tribunal recalls that those debts were covered by a grace period of two years, and were thereafter to have been re-scheduled. Further, the additional penalties for the delay were to have been waived pursuant to the 19 April 1999 Share Purchase Contract. As described in the Decision, despite this contractual commitment, the Romanian Ministry of Finance imposed, without any grace period, a substantially different and much less far-reaching rescheduling of debts and waiver of the additional penalties.136\n\n[\u2026]\n\n276.\n\nTherefore, the Claimants\u2019 failure to observe the rescheduling period for the debts, as imposed by the Romanian Ministry of Finance in breach of the Share Purchase Contract and which led to the freezing of the Company\u2019s bank accounts, cannot be held against the Claimants, despite the Respondent\u2019s arguments. Indeed, the Tribunal finds that the Claimants were not bound to comply with this amended rescheduling scheme, since it was in breach of the Share Purchase Contract. Consequently, the Claimants can be held responsible neither for the freezing of their bank accounts, nor for the consequences of that freeze.\n\n277.\n\nMoreover, the Tribunal recalls that the bank accounts had already been frozen as of 15 September 1999. This meant that Socomet was, as of that date, unable to conduct its operations as it should have, which in turn contributed to some of the acts and omissions of the Claimants now argued by the Respondent to have contributed to Socomet\u2019s insolvency.\n\n278.\n\nFurther, the Respondent is not well placed to reproach the Claimants\u2019 failure to invest the [... ] amount prior to June 2005 (including the [... ] before June 2001), as was agreed in the amended Share Purchase Contract.137 The Tribunal notes that the Romanian Ministry of Finance had, as of 19 October 1999 - and within seven months of the agreement -rescinded that agreement through its breach of the rescheduling and waiver commitments it undertook in the Share Purchase Contract.\n\nShare Purchase Contract, Art. 8.10 as amended on 7 July 1999 (C-20).\n\n279.\n\nFinally, taking into account the situation Socomet found itself because of the Romanian Ministry of Finance\u2019s retraction from the Share Purchase Contract\u2019s commitments and bank accounts, which were blocked within five months after the Claimants took over the operation, the Respondent does not demonstrate how the decisions of the executive directors and the establishment of Gavazzi Steel Consultants, the latter of which moreover had no proven negative bearing on Socomet\u2019s financial situation, would have contributed to Socomet\u2019s insolvency.\n\n280.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal determines that the Respondent caused the losses suffered by the Claimants as assessed in this Award, without any reduction for \"contributory negligence\" or other fault, as alleged by the Respondent.\n\n**F. Moral Damages**\n--------------------\n\n*a.* *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*b.* *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*c.* *The Tribunal\u2019s Decision*\n------------------------------\n\n289.\n\nMoral damages may be awarded in investment arbitration only in exceptional circumstances. No precise definition exists on what constitutes such \"exceptional circumstances\", and the definition must be gleaned from examples found in judicial and arbitral decisions.\n\n290.\n\nIn the *Desert Line* Case, the tribunal found that the claimant was subject to what it described as a siege with heavy artillery, an armed assault, an act of terror in its worst image,138 that the claimant suffered threats and attacks on the physical integrity of its investment,139 and that the settlement agreement was imposed onto the executives of the claimant under physical and financial duress.140 The award described the cause of the moral damages as the \"stress and anxiety of being harassed, threatened and detained\" and \"intimidated\" and the \"significant injury to [claimant\u2019s] credit and reputation and [claimant\u2019s] los[s] [of its] prestige\".141 In that case, the tribunal awarded the claimant [...] for moral damages.\n\n*Desert Line* Case, para. 166\n\n*Id.,* para. 185.\n\n*Id.,* para. 186.\n\n*Id.,* para. 286.\n\n291.\n\nThe umpire in the *Lusitania Cases,* acknowledging the mental suffering or shock caused by the violent severing of family ties by reason of the deaths caused by the torpedoing of the British ocean liner Lusitania,142 went on to find that \"one injured is... entitled to be compensated for an injury inflicted resulting in mental suffering, injury to his feelings, humiliation, shame, degradation, loss of social position or injury to his credit or to his reputation\",143 excluding, however, punitive damages.144\n\n*Lusitania Cases,* p. 35.\n\nId., p. 40.\n\nId., p. 33.\n\n292.\n\nOther tribunals have found for the award of moral damages, such as *Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe,145 LAFICO v. Burundi,146* and the *Fabiani* case.147 However, the conclusion which can be drawn from these examples is that, as a general rule, moral damages are not available to a party injured by the wrongful acts of a State, but that moral damages can be awarded in exceptional cases, provided that\n\n- The State\u2019s actions imply physical threat, illegal detention or other analogous situations in which the ill-treatment contravenes the norms according to which civilized nations are expected to act;\n\n- The State\u2019s actions cause a deterioration of health, stress, anxiety, other mental suffering such as humiliation, shame and degradation, or loss of reputation, credit and social position; and\n\n- Both cause and effect are grave or substantial.148\n\n*Bernhard von Pezold and others v. Republic of Zimbabwe* (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/15), Award (28 July 2015) (hereinafter *\"Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe\"),* para. 923.\n\n*Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company (LAFICO) v. Republic of Burundi,* Award (4 March 1991), 96 ILR 279.\n\nMixed Claims Commission, France-Venezuela, *Antoine Fabiani* case, 31 July 1905, X RIAA 83.\n\n*Von Pezold v. Zimbabwe,* paras. 918-920.\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal cannot find any evidence of such grave or substantial damage done to either of the Claimants by the Respondent in the present case, which would merit the award of compensation for moral damages. The Tribunal will apply the standards in the paragraph above to the acts identified by the Claimants.\n\n294.\n\nFirst, the Claimants argue that they had been deceived as to the granting of rescheduling and waiver, which were explicit conditions for their investment.149 The Tribunal finds that, although these actions on the part of the Respondent were in breach of their obligations, and caused the Claimants to have spent some four years in making requests for the rescheduling and waiver, such excessive or disproportionate efforts which an applicant may have incurred when requesting administrative licenses do not give rise to moral damages, since the injury does not meet any of the three standards required for the existence of moral damages.\n\nC-PHB, para. 238.\n\n295.\n\nSecondly, the Claimants argue that they were harassed and threatened with false and specious criminal accusations that were rejected by the Romanian courts.150 The fact that the Romanian courts, themselves an organ of the Romanian State, rejected the accusations, only shows this Tribunal that these claims do not meet the standards required for the Tribunal to find the existence of moral damages.\n\n*Id.,* para. 240.\n\n296.\n\nThirdly, the Claimants argue that the false accusations by the Respondent at the arbitration proceedings were \"malicious\",151 and that the unlawful conduct of the Respondent was \"manifestly and deliberately arbitrary\",152 and that such conduct caused the Claimants to lose their business credit and reputation in particular with major commercial partners such as Techint, Simest and SACE.153 The Tribunal has considered the circumstances of the case and decides that the gravity required under the standards for moral damages is not here present. The Tribunal sympathizes with the Claimants\u2019 predicament, but considers that the injury suffered cannot be compared to that caused by armed threats, by the witnessing of deaths or by other similar situations in which tribunals in the past have awarded moral damages. Moreover, the acknowledgement in the Decision that the Respondent has indeed breached the BIT, and the present award of substantial compensation, are elements of redress that significantly repair any loss of reputation the Claimants may have suffered.\n\n*Id.,* para. 242.\n\n*Id.,* para. 243.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n297.\n\nConsequently, the Tribunal decides that the moral aspects of the Claimants\u2019 injuries have already been compensated by the awarding of economic compensation, and that the extraordinary tests required for the recognition of separate and additional moral damages have not been met in this case.\n\n**G. Interest**\n---------------\n\n*a.* *The Claimants\u2019 Position*\n------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*b.* *The Respondent\u2019s Position*\n--------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n*c.* *The Tribunal \u2019s Decision*\n-------------------------------\n\n301.\n\nAs regards interest, Article 4(4) of the BIT provides:\n\n*Compensation shall include interest calculated on a six months LIBOR basis accruing from the date of expropriation to the date of payment, excepting the investor has maintained the enjoyment of the expropriated investment until the date of said compensation.*\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimants have requested that the interest should be compounded semi-annually, while the Respondent argues that compound interest is not due as the principal claim is not substantiated. The BIT contains no express provision on compound interest. However the reference to \"market value\" in the first paragraph of Article 4(4) of the BIT points to the permissible application of reasonable compound rates, especially:\n\n*...given that it is the universal practice of banks and other loan providers in the world market to provide monies at a cost amounting to or equivalent to compound rates of interest and not simple interest. In addition, it is... the current practice of international tribunals (including ICSID) is to award compound and not simple interest. In the Tribunal\u2019s opinion, there is now a form of jurisprudence constante where the presumption has shifted from the position a decade or so ago with the result it would now be more appropriate to order compound interest, unless shown to be inappropriate in favour of simple interest, rather than vice-versa.154*\n\n*Gemplus v. Mexico,* paras. 16-26. *See also* Dolzer and Schreuer, *Principles of International Investment Law* (2nd ed, Oxford UP: 2012), at p. 298; Ripinsky and Williams, *Damages in International Investment Law,* (BIICL: 2008) at p. 387; and Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law*, (OUP: 2009), paras. 6,102 and 6,103.\n\n303.\n\nArticle 4(4) of the BIT provides for the consideration of LIBOR which, by definition, is a commercial rate of interest between commercial banks and financial institutions. As regards commercial rates of interest, even if the Tribunal is to consider financial practices frozen as at 1990 (the date of the BIT) or 1995 (the date of the entry into force of the BIT), it must include compound interest in this Award. Banks, then and now, do not charge simple interest. As private investors, the Claimants must pay compound interest on their debts and receive compound interest on their deposits.\n\n304.\n\nMoreover, decisions such as *Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena S.A. v. Republic of Costa Rica,*155 have established that, to reflect economic reality, arbitral tribunals may grant compound interest, as follows:\n\n*In particular, where an owner of property has at some earlier time lost the value of his asset but has not received the monetary equivalent that then became due to him, the amount of compensation should reflect, at least in part, the additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the income generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing rates of interest. It is not the purpose of compound interest to attribute blame to, or to punish, anybody for the delay in the payment made to the expropriated owned; it is a mechanism to ensure that the compensation awarded the claimant is appropriate in the circumstances...156*\n\n[\u2026]\n\n*Id.,* paras. 103-105.\n\n305.\n\nThese and other cases signify the genesis of a *jurisprudence constante* for international investment arbitration tribunals, unless precluded otherwise by, for example, the express wording of the BIT.157 In the majority\u2019s view, it is here not precluded, but rather mandated, to order compound interest.\n\nDr F.A. Mann, in \"Compound Interest as an Item of Damage in International Law\" (1988) 21:3 *U.C. Davis Law Review* 577 at 586, concluded, almost thirty years ago: \"... on the basis of compelling evidence compound interest may be and, in the absence of special circumstances, should be awarded to the claimant as damages by international tribunals.\" Subsequently, scholarly opinion supported the award of compound interest under international law in even stronger terms: *see* N. Affolder, \"Awarding Compound Interest in International Arbitration\" (2001) 12 *Am Rev Int\u2019I Arb* 45 at 92 (\"While arguments for allowing compound interest in both domestic legal systems and international arbitrations focus on \u2018contemporary commercial reality\u2019, compound interest has been around for thousands of years. Compound interest is not a modem financial technique. Rather, it is a long-recognized economic principle that acknowledges that not only principal attracts interest, but interest does as well. Those who present the battle to allow compound interest as one of overcoming \u2018ancient and medieval prejudices\u2019 [footnote here omitted] ignore compound interest's long history.\" See also J.Y. Gotanda, \"Compound Interest In International Disputes\" (2003) *Law and Policy in International Business* 393 (\"there is no rule of international law prohibiting compound interest\"); and J.M. Col\u00f3n & M.S. Knoll, \"Prejudgment Interest in International Arbitration\", (2007) 4:6 *TDM* 1 at 7 (\"Awarding simple interest generally fails to compensate claimants fully and can create strong incentives for respondents to delay arbitration proceedings and cause harms, thereby wasting resources\"). *See also* C-SSQ, paras. 149-154 and the legal materials cited in fn. 154 above.\n\n306.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore, by majority, awards the Claimants compound interest on the amount of compensation, as calculated on the LIBOR rate for six months denominated in USD, and adjusted every six months, from 1 September 2002 until the date of payment of this Award.158\n\nAs submitted by the Claimants in C-PHB, para. 247.\n\n**IV.

Schreuer \"The ICSID Convention: A Commentary\", Second Edition, 2009, p. 1232.\n\n*Lemire v. Ukraine,* para. 380; *Plama Consortium Limited v. Republic of Bulgaria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24), Award (27 August 2008), para. 316; *Phoenix Action, Ltd. v. Czech Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/06/05), Award (15 April 2009), para. 151.\n\n312.\n\nIn the exercise of this discretion, the Tribunal will thus apply the principle that \"costs follow the event,\" by a weighing of relative success in the proceedings. In doing so, it will consider the two main phases of the arbitration: (i) the proceeding on jurisdiction, admissibility and the counterclaim; and (ii) the proceedings on quantum. The successful party\u2019s reasonable costs in these two phases will be allocated proportionally to the outcome of the case.\n\n313.\n\nThe Tribunal will successively discuss the direct costs of the proceedings and the legal fees and costs of the Parties.\n\n314.\n\nThe direct costs of the proceeding include: (i) the fees and expenses of each Member of the Tribunal; (ii) payments made by ICSID for other direct expenses, such as those related to the conduct of hearings *(e.g.,* court reporting, audio visual, interpretation, the ICC hearing center charges and courier services), as well as estimated charges related to the dispatch of this Award; and (iii) ICSID\u2019s administrative fees (the \"Costs of the Proceeding\").\n\n315.\n\nThe total Costs of the Proceeding amount to (in USD):\n\nArbitrators\u2019 fees and expenses\n\nHans van Houtte [... ]\n\nMauro Rubino-Sammartano [... ]\n\nV.V. Veeder [...]\n\nOther direct expenses (estimated) [... ]\n\nICSID\u2019s administrative fees [...]\n\n**Total [...]**\n\n316.\n\nThe Costs of the Proceeding relating to the proceeding on jurisdiction, admissibility and the counterclaim *(i.e.,* up to the Decision of 21 April 2015) amount to [...]. The Costs of the Proceeding relating to the proceeding on quantum amount to [...].\n\n317.\n\nThe above costs have been paid out of the advances made to ICSID by the Parties in equal parts. Once the case account balance is final, the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed financial statement, and any remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties equally.\n\n318.\n\nOn the other hand, the legal and other fees and expenses of the Parties consist of:\n\nFor Claimants:\n\nLegal Fees: [...]\n\nExpert Fees [...]\n\nMiscellaneous Expenses: [...]\n\nFor Respondent:\n\nLegal Fees: [...]\n\nExpert Fees [...]\n\nMiscellaneous Expenses: [...]\n\n319.\n\nThe Tribunal has considered the Parties\u2019 legal and other fees and expenses and finds them reasonable. It does not interpret Arbitration Rule 28(2) to mean that all fees need to be paid before the conclusion of the proceedings.\n\n320.\n\nWhile the Claimants did not succeed on every single claim on liability, they clearly prevailed in the first phase of the proceeding, and the Tribunal therefore decides that the Respondent shall bear the Claimants\u2019 full costs relating to that phase. The Claimants were awarded compensation in the second phase of the arbitration, but significantly less than they requested. Therefore, the Tribunal decides to allocate to the Claimants one third of the Costs of the Proceedings relating to the second phase of the proceedings and of its legal costs and expenses, and the full costs of their quantum expert.\n\n321.\n\nTaking all these factors into consideration, the Arbitral Tribunal, by majority, hereby orders the Respondent to reimburse the Claimants a proportion of the reasonable costs and expenses of pursuing this arbitration in the following manner:\n\n- 100% of the Claimants\u2019 legal costs, and the fees and expenses of witnesses presented by the Claimants other than Deloitte before April 2015; and\n\n- 33.3% of the fees and expenses of Deloitte and the Claimants\u2019 legal costs after April 2015.\n\n322.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 share of the Costs of the Proceeding in the first phase amounts to [...] (including the USD 25,000.00 lodging fee paid by the Claimants). The Claimants incurred [...] on account of their legal and other fees and expenses.162 These costs shall thus be borne by the Respondent.\n\nThis figure has been determined on the basis of the invoices included in the Annex to the Claimants\u2019 Submissions on Costs dated 28 July 2016 which pre-date 21 April 2015, including outstanding invoices which relate to services provided during the first phase of the arbitration *(i.e.,* Section 2.1 invoice nos. G/l-G/7 and Section 4.1 invoice nos. 1-3), but excluding the [...]invoices listed in Section 3.\n\n323.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 share of the Costs of the Proceeding amounted to [... ] in the second phase, and the Respondent shall therefore bear [...] of these costs. The Claimants incurred [...] on account of their legal fees and miscellaneous expenses in the second phase of the proceedings, and [...] on account of the fees of their quantum expert, Deloitte, as per their submission on costs. The Respondent shall therefore bear [...] of these costs.\n\n324.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal, by majority, orders the Respondent to pay the Claimants [...] for the expended portion of the Claimants\u2019 total Costs of the Proceeding and [...] to cover their legal and other fees and expenses.\n\n325.\n\nThe Secretariat is to provide the Parties a detailed breakdown of the fees paid to the arbitrators and of the costs incurred. Any excess amounts shall be reimbursed equally to the Parties.\n\n**V.

In my respectful submission my main disagreement with my colleagues centres around setting out of contentious factual positions regarding the identity of the Claimants and their investment in Argentina. These issues have remains unresolved from the Decision on Jurisdiction (when I provided a Separate Opinion) and were to be dealt with in the Award on the Merits. The Award does not deal with or settle those outstanding issues. My objections related to the preliminary, but fundamental, unresolved issues which were to be dealt with in the Award on the merits upon consideration of the evidence on record, such as the identity of the Claimants which is dealt with, but not resolved in the Award, in turn giving rise to other abnormalities.\n\n2.\n\nTo determine the identity of the Claimants, the following simple, but crucial, issues should have been resolved:\n\n- Who are the Claimants?\n\n- How and when did the Claimants invest in the Argentine Republic?\n\n- What is the \"investment\" made by the Claimants?\n\n- Does King and Spalding have a valid Power of Attorney ?\n\n3.\n\nIn the Award the term \"Claimants\" is used not only to refer to the three named Claimants - Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A., and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. - but also to Air Comet, Interinvest, and/or other entities and individuals operating with the Marsans Group. I cannot agree with this particularly because Claimants do not spell out the ownership structure of the Marsans Group.\n\n4.\n\nIt may be useful at the outset to review the facts regarding the identity of the numerous parties involved. It is crucial that we identify the \"Claimants\" and distinguish them from other parties or non-entities. It is only the three named Claimants who can be considered as asserting their own \"rights\" and claiming their \"reliefs\" for the infringement of their rights of which only the Claimants can claim protection of the Argentina-Spain Bilateral Investment Treaty (\"BIT\" or \"Treaty\").\n\n**IDENTITY OF CLAIMANTS**\n-------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe three named Claimants have failed to establish their investment in Argentina which is protected by the BIT. The facts surrounding the identity of the Claimants are set out below.\n\n6.\n\nIn the 1980s the Government of Argentina (\"GOA\") initiated a general privatization process pursuant to which the state-owned *Aerol\u00edneas Argentinas Sociedad del Estado* (\"AASE\") was to be privatized. In 1990 AASE\u2019s assets were transferred to a newly-formed company named *Aerol\u00edneas Argentina Sociedad An\u00f3nima* (\"ARSA\") which was acquired by a group of investors including the Spanish state-owned airline *Iberia L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.* (\"Iberia\"). Iberia controlled 20% of the shares, other Spanish investors 9.5%, and Argentine investors 55.5%. Subsequently, between 1990 and 1996, the Spanish Government increased its participation in ARSA from 20% to 84%.\n\n7.\n\nIn 1971 *Austral L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas, S.A.* (\"Austral\") was formed by the merger of two privately-owned airlines *Austral Compa\u00f1\u00eda Argentina de Transportes A\u00e9reos Comercial e Industrial* and *Aerotranportes Litoral Argentino.* In 1985, Austral was purchased by *Cielos del Sur S.A.,* a holding company, which became *Austral-Cielos del Sur S.A* (\"AUSA\"). During 1991 *Iberia L\u00edneas A\u00e9reas de Espa\u00f1a, S.A.* (\"Iberia\") a Spanish state- owned airline acquired Cielos del Sur. By 1991, the Spanish Government acquired AUSA and became a significant shareholder in both ARSA and AUSA (collectively referred to as the Argentine Airlines). It may be noteworthy that the Spain-Argentina BIT came into force on 28 September 1992.\n\n8.\n\nIn 1994, Iberia incorporated a fully-owned Argentine subsidiary, Interinvest S.A. (\"Interinvest\"), to serve as the holding company for the Spanish investments in the Argentine Airlines. As a result, Interinvest became the Argentine Airlines\u2019 controlling shareholder.\n\n9.\n\nIn 1995, the Spanish Government constituted *Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales* (SEPI) to operate as the holding company for all companies fully or partially owned by the Spanish Government. As a consequence, SEPI acquired Iberia\u2019s shareholding participation in Interinvest.\n\n10.\n\nIn 2001, the Argentine Airlines were owned by SEPI. SEPI was a holding company for all companies fully or partially owned by the Spanish government. SEPI owned the Argentine Airlines through an Argentine intermediary company called Interinvest. SEPI owned 99.2% of Interinvest, and Interinvest in turn held 92.1% of ARSA\u2019s shares and 90% of AUSA\u2019s shares.1 By mid 2001 the Argentine Airlines were experiencing financial difficulties and ARSA filed for bankruptcy reorganization. In 2001 SEPI announced it would sell its participation in Interinvest through a bidding process.\n\nEx. C-11.\n\n11.\n\nAir Comet, a Spanish company, entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") dated October 2, 2001 with SEPI for the purchase of shares in Interinvest for a consideration of United States Dollar One (US$ 1). It is important to note that Air Comet is not a Claimant in this arbitration.\n\n12.\n\nThe changes in the shareholding of Air Comet were as follows:\n\n**2001:**\n\nIn 2001 the shareholders in Air Comet were as follow:\n\n*Autobuses Urbanos -* 35%\n\n*Transportes de Cercan\u00edas* -35%\n\n*Proturin S.A.* -29.8%\n\n*Segetur S.A.* -0.2%\n\n**July 2006:** Teinver purchased the shareholding of *Proturin* and *Segetur.*\n\n**2006-2007:** There were changes in the share structure of Air Comet several times, which becomes majority shareholder of Air Comet and the shareholding in Air Comet stood as follows:\n\n**October 2, 2007:**\n\nTeinver - 56%\n\nAutobuses Urbanos -22%\n\nTransportes de Cercan\u00edas -22%\n\n**December 31, 2007,** Teinver purchased additional shares from Transportes de Cercan\u00edas so that the shareholdings in Air Comet stood as follows:\n\nTeinver - 66.67%\n\nAutobuses Urbanos -22%\n\nTransportes de Cercan\u00edas -11.33%\n\n**December 11 2008:**\n\nRequest for Arbitration was received by ICSID from the Claimants on 11 December 2008, on which date the shareholding in Air Comet stood as follows:\n\nTeinver - 96.77%\n\nAutobuses Urbanos -2.13%\n\nTransportes de Cercan\u00edas -1.1%\n\n13.\n\nOn 30 January 2009 ICSID registered the Request and notified the parties, the case being registered as ICSID Case No. ARB/09/1.\n\n14.\n\nTwo of the Claimants held shares in Air Comet, which was a Spanish company, when Air Comet entered into the SPA with SEPI by investing US$1 to acquire the shares of Interinvest, an Argentine company, holding shares of the Argentine Airlines. The third Claimant, Teinver, was not even a shareholder of Air Comet when Air Comet acquired the shares from SEPI through the SPA. Teinver cannot claim to have \"acquired their investment\" by way of the SPA between Air Comet and SEPI when Teinver was not even a shareholder of Air Comet. Similarly, for the other two Claimants (Spanish companies), their shareholding in Air Comet (another Spanish company) cannot constitute an \"investment\" in the Argentine Airlines under the Spain-Argentine BIT.\n\n15.\n\nSince Air Comet is not a Claimant, the burden of proof rests on the three named Claimants to prove that their \"investment\" in the Argentine Airlines, to show what liabilities were assumed, and what contributions were made by each of the Claimants to the Argentine Airlines. Claimants have not discharged this burden of proof to show that their shares in Air Comet, a Spanish limited liability company, falls within the definition of \"investment\" under the BIT. Claimants made no financial contribution (since they were not parties to the SPA) and assumed no liabilities under the SPA. The liabilities were assumed by Air Comet, and not by Claimants. The rights of Claimants do not exist independently of the rights of Air Comet. Claimants have not satisfied how their shareholding rights in Air Comet can be treated as a protected investment under the BIT.\n\n16.\n\nNo shares in Argentine Airlines were ever sold to the three named Claimants. Claimants had the burden of showing when the shares in the Argentine Airlines were sold to the three Claimants, which they have failed to do. The SPA between Air Comet and SEPI does not provide proof of acquisition of shares by the Claimants, given the fact that the Claimants were not even parties to the SPA.\n\n17.\n\nClaimants\u2019 shares in Air Comet were not shares in Argentine entities. Air Comet was a company incorporated in Spain. Claimants were all Spanish shareholders with no connection to Argentina. The Claimants\u2019 shareholding in Air Comet (under the laws of Spain) could not have been an investment \"acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of\u2019 Argentina or \"shares in Argentine entities\". The Claimants\u2019 shareholdings thus fail to meet the territoriality requirement of the BIT.2\n\nThe term \"investments\" in Article I of the BIT is defined to mean *\"any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind,* ***acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment*** *and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:*  \n***- Shares and other forms of participation in companies;...***  \n*The content and scope of the rights corresponding to the various categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Party* ***in whose territory the investment is situated....***  \n***4. The term \"territory\" shall mean the land territory of each Party,*** *as well as the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf beyond the limits of the territorial sea of each Party over which it has or may have, in accordance with international law, jurisdiction and sovereign rights for the purposes of prospection, exploration and conservation of natural resources.*\n\n**MARSANS GROUP**\n-----------------\n\n18.\n\nThe composition and legal character of the \"Marsans Group\" remain undefined. It is evident that the \"Marsans Group\" is not a legal entity nor can it be treated as a party to these proceedings. \"Marsans Group\" is also not party to any agreement related to the transactions involved in these proceedings. Assertions that Claimants were \"part of the Marsans Group,\"3, a Spanish consortium that was owned by the late Mr. Gonzalo Pascual Arias and by Mr. Gerardo D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n, do not give them any *locus standi* in this arbitration. To make matters even more complex, the assets of the so-called Marsans Group, including Teinver, were sold by Mr. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n and Mr. Pascual Arias to a Spanish entity called \"Posibilitum Business\" in July 2010.4 Mr. Pascual Arias died on June 21, 2012. Mr. D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n was provisionally detained on December 5, 2012 in connection with the Operaci\u00f3n Crucero criminal investigation conducted in Spain, where he currently remains in detention.5\n\nRFA\u00b63.\n\nSee Merits Hearing p. 54. *See also* Respondent\u2019s Memorial on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 282 (\"The transaction entailed selling assets such as ViajesMarsans and Teinver S.A., which comprise the Hotetur hotel chain, the Air Comet S.A. airline, SegurosMercurio and Newco handling company, among more than 50 travel companies.\").\n\nCM \u00b6 111; *see* Ex. RA-180, Annex P03.\n\n19.\n\nOn April 14, 2010 Claimants entered into the \"Burford Funding Agreement\" with Burford Capital Limited (\"the Funder\" or \"Burford\"), an investment company headquartered in Guernsey, Channel Islands. The Burford Funding Agreement which concerned the financing of Claimants\u2019 litigation expenses in this arbitration. Respondent has argued that Burford is a \"vulture fund\" that will be the primary beneficiary of any ICSID award in this case.\n\n20.\n\nAccording to the Burford Funding Agreement the Funder will get the following allocations from any compensation paid to the Claimants by the Tribunal:\n\n40% of the first $100 million  \n 30% of the net recovery amount between $100 million and $500 million   \n25% of the net recovery amount between $500 million and $800 million   \n15% of the net recovery amount above $800 million\n\n21.\n\nThe so-called \"Marsans Group\" cannot claim to be entitled to any relief since an undefined group which was neither a party to the SPA, nor was it named as a Claimant, can clearly not be treated as Claimant. In these proceedings Claimants can only be those entities or persons who have instituted the arbitration, in other words, Claimants-on-record.\n\n22.\n\nThese Claimants on record are:\n\n*- TRANSPORTES DE CERCAN\u00cdAS S.A.*\n\n*- AUTOBUSES URBANOS DEL SUR S.A.*\n\n*- TEINVER S.A.*\n\n23.\n\nNone of the three Claimants nor \"the Marsans Group\", the late Mr. Gonzalo Pascual Arias, Mr. Gerardo D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n, or Burford were a party to the SPA dated October 2, 2001. It was Air Comet which invested US$1 to acquire the shares of Interinvest in Argentine Airlines. Air Comet, however, is not a Claimant. The Claimants were not parties to the SPA and undertook no contractual responsibilities under the SPA.\n\n24.\n\nThe real identity of the \"Claimants\" is not an issue that can remain unresolved. Equally important is how and when any investment was made by the three named Claimants, which can claim to be protected under the BIT.\n\n25.\n\nThe scope of protection that can be claimed and granted to parties could be gathered from the provisions of the BIT. The BIT will have to be reasonably construed, giving due weight to the object of the BIT as set out in the following terms:\n\n*The Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, hereinafter referred to as \"the Parties\",*\n\n*Desiring to intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both countries,*\n\n*Intending to create favourable conditions for investments made by investors of either State in the territory of the other State,*\n\n*Recognizing that the promotion and protection of investments in accordance with this Agreement will encourage initiatives in this field. \"*\n\n26.\n\nThe Claimants Memorial on Merits (\"CMM\") states in paragraph 2 that \"Claimants purchased the Argentine Airlines in 2001 and operated them until the GOA nationalized them in 2008\". There are a number of statements in the CMM which instead of clarifying the identity of the Claimants obscures it by confusing references to Claimants with references to Air Comet and/or to the Marsans Group as summarized below:\n\n(a) In paragraph 34 of the CMM it is stated that out of nine offers SEPI pre-selected four bidders including the Claimants through **Air Comet** as part of the Marsans Group.\n\n(b) In paragraph 35 it is stated that \"SEPI ultimately selected **Claimants\u2019** offer.\n\n(c) In paragraph 36 it is stated that \"(a) Claimants offered certain synergies, (b) **Air Comet** was owned by the Marsans Group\" as explained by Gerardo Diaz Ferran, former co-owner of Marsans Group.\n\n(d) The Argentine Airlines was thus to become part of a larger network of companies...\". We were owners of \"Viajes Marsans, the number one travel agency in Spain... **Air****Comet** which operated charter flights to the Caribbean, South America and Canary Island\".\n\n(e) In paragraph 40 it is stated that: \"on 2 October 2001, SEPI and **Air Comet** entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (\"SPA\") through which the latter acquired 99.2% of the share of Interinvest while the purchase price was US$1, and **Claimants** undertook a number financial commitments:\n\n\u2022 To assume Interinvest\u2019s, ARSA\u2019s and AUSA\u2019s liabilities (ARSA\u2019s liabilities at the time were in excess of US$1 billion);\n\n\u2022 To retain ARSA\u2019s and AUSA\u2019s personnel for a period of two years;\n\n\u2022 To maintain a majority interest in the Argentine Airlines for a period of two years;\n\n\u2022 To restart flights on existing routes and develop new routes as soon as possible;\n\n\u2022 To make a US$50 million capital contribution; and\n\n\u2022 To modernize and expand the airlines\u2019 fleet.\n\n**WHAT IS THE INVESTMENT? WHO MADE THE INVESTMENTS, WHEN ANDHOW?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nAs indicated above, instead of clarifying the identity of the Claimants the averments reproduced above have made this task difficult, if not impossible. This is further evident from the averments made regarding who are the investors and what investments are claimed to have been made by them and on what dates. These are summarized below:\n\n28.\n\nIn Paragraph 41 of the CMM it is stated that:\n\n(a) \"In exchange for these commitments, SEPI agreed to contribute up to US$248 million to be applied by Claimants\u2019 Air Comet in the implementation of a business plan,\n\n(b) US$300 million to be applied to the payment of specific pre-existing debts. In addition, given that the financial statements upon which SEPI launched the bidding process and Claimants made their offer were updated as of July 2001, SEPI later agreed to contribute an additional amount of US$205 million to cover the operational losses suffered by the Argentine Airlines between July and October 2001.\"\n\n29.\n\nIn Paragraph 1 of the Claimants\u2019 Post Hearing Brief (\"CPHB\"), it is stated that the Claimants rely on their memorials which are hereby incorporated by reference, and then go on to state in paragraph 7 as follows:\n\n\"7. During the merits hearing, Argentina argued that Claimants\u2019 invested \"not even one peso\" in the Argentine Airlines. But in fact, Claimants and their subsidiaries invested millions of dollars in the Argentine Airlines. Claimants made cash contributions of US$13.5 million in Interinvest, US$9.9 million in ARSA, and US$0.8 million in AUSA. KPMG confirmed it. Further, Claimants also reinvested in the Argentine Airlines the US$106 million in profits that ARSA and AUSA made during 2002, 2003, and 2004.\"\n\n30.\n\nThe averments made in the pleadings, in the CMM and CPHB somewhat disingenuously refer to Grupo Marsans as the Claimants without any attempt to define the composition and character of Grupo Marsans or to explain how an undefined consortium, embracing a large number of entities (according to one report, consisting of at least 117 companies) can be referred to as Claimants disregarding the fact that there are three named Claimants of which one (Teinver) did not even acquire any shares before 2006/2007. Example of such averments are summarized below:\n\n(a) In paragraph 4 of the CPHB the Claimants expert Ricover is quoted as saying that \"I do not see any reasons to support that Grupo Marsans was not running the Argentine Airlines efficiently\"\n\n(b) in the next paragraph 5, it is stated that \"Claimants have demonstrated that these achievements were direct consequences of their investments and sound management of the Argentine Airlines.\"\n\n(c) In paragraph 6 Grupo Marsans is indicated to have been the bidder which had entered into SPA, blatantly ignoring the fact that it was Air Comet which was bidder and party to the SPA.\n\n(d) Matters are not made clearer, by the further averments in paragraph 6 as follows: This Tribunal already acknowledged the complexity of this transaction in which Claimants and other companies of Grupo Marsans made a number of significant commitments\". It is noteworthy that Air Comet did not institute the arbitration as a Claimant.\n\n31.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention limit\u2019s the Centre\u2019s jurisdiction to the legal disputes arising \u2018directly out of an investment\u2019. While the term \u2018investment\u2019 has been construed widely, it is not without limits. The key to determining whether a activity constitutes an investment is not \"the area of economic activity covered, but the form and nature of that activity\". In *Fedax NV v Republic of Venezuela6* the basic features of an investment have been described as involving a certain duration, a certain regularity of profit and return, assumption of risk, a substantial commitment and a significance for the host State\u2019s development. Schreuer observes that the ICSID Convention \u2018does not imply unlimited freedom for parties...the term \"investment\" has an objective meaning independent of the parties\u2019 disposition\u2019.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/96/3.\n\n32.\n\nThe Spain-Argentina BIT contains a definition of \u2018investment\u2019 and provides that:\n\nThe term \"investments\" shall mean any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind, acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:\n\n- Shares and other forms of participation in companies;\n\n- Rights derived from any kind of contribution made with the intention of creating economic value, including loans directly linked with a specific investment, whether capitalized or not;\n\n- Movable and immovable property and real rights such as mortgages, privileges, sureties, usufructs and similar rights;\n\n-Any kind of rights in the field of intellectual property, including patents, trade marks, manufacturing licenses and know-how;\n\n- Concessions granted by law or by virtue of a contract for engaging in economic and commercial activity, in particular those related to the prospection, cultivation, mining or development of natural resources.\n\n33.\n\nThe Preamble to the Spain-Argentina BIT provides:\n\n\"The Argentine Republic and the Kingdom of Spain, hereinafter referred to as \"the Parties\",\n\nDesiring to intensify economic cooperation for the economic benefit of both countries,\n\nIntending to create favourable conditions for investments made by investors of either State in the territory of the other State,\n\nRecognizing that the promotion and protection of investments in accordance with this Agreement will encourage initiatives in this field,\n\nHave agreed as follows:\"\n\nThe purpose of the BIT was the promotion and protection of investment and the creation of favourable conditions for investments made by investors in the territory of the host state for the \"economic benefit\" of the host state.\n\n34.\n\nThe relevant test for the Tribunal to determine whether it has jurisdiction is a \"double keyhole approach\" or a \"double-barreled\" test. Claimants have to satisfy the requirements of both the ICSID Convention and the BIT. Under the double-barreled test the activities of Claimants have to meet the definition of \"investment\" in the BIT as well as the \"objective\" criteria of an investment within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention (as held in *CSOB v Slovakia7, Salini v Morocco8*, and *Joy Mining v Egypt9).*\n\n*Ceskoslovenska obchodni banka, a.s. v. Slovak Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/4), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction (May 24, 1999), available at http://www.woridbank.org/icsid/cases/csob\\_decision.pdf; Decision of the Tribunal on the Further and Partial Objection to Jurisdiction of December 1, 2000, 15 ICSID Rev.\u2014FILJ 530 (2000).\n\n*Salini Construttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Kingdom of Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4), Decision on Jurisdiction of July 23, 2001, 129 Journal du droit international 196 (2002) [French original]; English translation in 42 ILM 609 (2003).\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v The Arab Republic of Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11), Award on Jurisdiction of 06 August 2004.\n\n35.\n\nThe ICSID Convention expressly states in Article 25 clause (1):\n\n\"The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.\"\n\nFor the purpose of proper definition of \"investment\" we need to interpret Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. Article 31 of the Vienna Convention requires that courts and arbitral tribunals shall interpret treaties \"in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose\". The Vienna Convention specifically states that the preamble and the annexes qualify part of the text for the purposes of interpretation (Article 31(2)) and that context includes \"any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation\" and \"(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable\" (Article 31(3)(b) and (c)). The current leading decision on the definition of \"investment\" in ICSID arbitration, *Salini v Morocco10,* has existed for more than a decade. It laid down the test that requires investment to have four elements: (i) a contribution of money or other assets; (ii) a certain duration; (iii) an element of risk; (iv) a contribution to the host State\u2019s development.\n\nICSID Case No. ARB/00/4\n\n36.\n\nClaimants\u2019 had not transferred any financial resources to the host state, Argentina, when Air Comet bought shares in the Argentine Airlines for US$1. The SPA did not involve any contribution of assets by Claimants. Air Comet received payments from SEPI to meet the liabilities of the Argentine Airlines. Air Comet made a nominal payment of US$1 for the shares. There was no risk borne by Claimants. In relation to the activities or obligations undertaken by Air Comet under the SPA:\n\n- there was no transfer of financial resources from Claimants to Argentina;  \n - the SPA involved a one-off transaction and not of any certain duration;  \n - there was no risk borne by Claimants;  \n - and there was no substantial commitment or significant contribution to Argentina\u2019s development.\n\n37.\n\nAcquiring of the shares by Air Comet and subsequent transfers to the three named Claimants could not properly, therefore, be treated as protected \"investment\".\n\n38.\n\nThe Tribunal\u2019s Decision on Jurisdiction is based on a *prima facie* assessment. The Tribunal in *Siemens AG v Argentina* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004) explained the position in the following terms:\n\n\"At this [jurisdictional] stage of the proceedings, the Tribunal is not required to consider whether the claims under the Treaty made by Siemens are correct. This is a matter for the merits. **The Tribunal simply has to be satisfied that, if the****Claimant\u2019s allegations would be proven correct, then the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider them.\"** *[emphasis added]*\n\n39.\n\nNothing stated by the Tribunal at the jurisdictional phase is conclusive on the basic issue to whether Claimants have rights which fall under the definition of \"investments\" as contained in Article I of the BIT and in respect of which protection can be granted under the BIT.\n\n40.\n\nThe identification of the \"investment\", that is the subject matter of the present claim, and the identities of the investors, who are entitled to claim damages, are crucial issues to be determined at the merits stage. The alleged violation of the investors\u2019 rights, and the potential relief than can be awarded, will depend on the answer to the following questions:\n\n- What constituted the \"investment\"?\n\n- Who are the investors? What are the identities of the investors who can claim damages under the BIT?\n\n41.\n\nIn the present case, the identification of the \"investment\" is difficult since the investment arises from a complex transaction under which Claimants were purportedly undertaking responsibilities and risks in assuming debts and liabilities of the airlines going forward and the undertaking to maintain and expand the operations of the airlines. The questions which need to be answered at the outset are:\n\n- Which Claimant assumed what liability?\n\n- Whether Claimants assumed liabilities, by what means, and in relation to which creditors?\n\n42.\n\nRegardless of the complexity of the transactions, Claimants\u2019 \"investment\" of which they seek protection under the BIT has to be identified.\n\n43.\n\nCan the shares that Claimants held in Air Comet S.A., a Spanish limited liability company, fall under the definition of \"investment\" which states that the \"investment\" has to be ***\"acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment\"*** *and that the \"content and scope of the rights corresponding to the various categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Party* ***in whose territory the investment is situated\"?*** Do we not need to consider under which Argentine law Claimants acquired rights which can be treated as \"investment\" under the BIT?\n\n44.\n\nIt seems disingenuous for Claimants to allege making an \"investment\" in the Argentine Airlines. The Argentine Airlines were in operation long before Claimants bought on different dates (as late as 2006 in the case of Teinver) shares in Air Comet, a Spanish company. We need to ask the further questions -\n\nWhether and how did each of the Claimants acquire shares in Air Comet? Can Claimants\u2019 acquisition of shares, in the circumstances of the case, be treated as an investment made \"in accordance with the legislation of\u2019 Argentina? What are the content and scope of the rights acquired by Claimants as determined by Argentine law?\n\n45.\n\nSince there is no evidence that Claimants made any financial contribution which can be characterized as \"investment\" in the Argentine Airlines, it is not clear how any right in respect of Claimants\u2019 shares in Air Comet can be said to be protected under the BIT.\n\n46.\n\nThe issue to be decided is whether Claimants (as shareholders of Air Comet) may claim compensation for alleged violations of the BIT when Air Comet (the company which actually held the shares in Interinvest, the holding company of the Argentine Airlines) itself does not make such claims before the Tribunal. Claimants have failed to show how their shareholder rights exist independent of the rights of Air Comet and how those shareholder rights can be treated as a protected investment.\n\n47.\n\nIt is necessary to look at the precise content and scope of the rights which Claimants allege are their investments and to consider whether these rights constitute investments which can claim to be protected by the BIT.\n\n48.\n\nThe term \"investments\" in Article I of the BIT is defined to mean\n\n*\"any kind of assets, such as property and rights of every kind,* ***acquired or effected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment*** *and in particular, but not exclusively, the following:*\n\n***- Shares and other forms of participation in companies;***\n\n*- Rights derived from any kind of contribution made with the intention of creating economic value, including loans directly linked with a specific investment, whether capitalized or not;*\n\n*- Movable and immovable property and real rights such as mortgages, privileges, sureties, usufructs and similar rights;*\n\n*- Any kind of rights in the field of intellectual property, including patents, trade marks, manufacturing licenses and know-how;*\n\n*- Concessions granted by law or by virtue of a contract for engaging in economic and commercial activity, in particular those related to the prospection, cultivation, mining or development of natural resources.*\n\n*The content and scope of the rights corresponding to the various categories of assets shall be determined by the laws and regulations of the Party* ***in whose territory the investment is situated.***\n\n*No modification in the legal forum in which assets and capital have been invested or reinvested shall affect their status as investments in accordance with this Agreement.*\n\n*3. The terms \"investment income or earnings\" shall mean returns from an investment in accordance with the definition contained in the preceding paragraph and shall expressly include profits, dividends and interest.*\n\n*4.* ***The term \"territory\" shall mean the land territory of each Party,*** *as well as the exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf beyond the limits of the territorial sea of each Party over which it has or may have, in accordance with international law, jurisdiction and sovereign rights for the purposes of prospection, exploration and conservation of natural resources.*\n\n49.\n\nClaimants cannot claim that their rights in respect of which they claim protection of the BIT were \"acquired or affected in accordance with the legislation of the country receiving the investment\" (that is the Argentine law) since Claimants\u2019 rights are those of a shareholder of Air Comet S.A., a limited liability company in Spain.\n\n50.\n\nThe precise content and scope of the rights alleged by Claimants as being violated must be identified and the question that must be answered is whether the rights of Claimants can be treated as \"investments\" as defined in Article I of the BIT.\n\n**IV. ISSUE OF ADMISSIBILITY AND STANDING NOT ADDRESSED IN THEDECISION ON JURISDICTION**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nThe issue of the Power of Attorney of King & Spalding to represent Claimants arose in the context of the insolvency proceedings in respect of Claimants and of Air Comet.\n\n52.\n\nInsolvency Proceedings were commenced in respect of each of the Claimants on the dates as noted below:\n\n- Teinver in December 2010.\n\n- Transportes de Cercanias in February 2011.\n\n- Autobuses Urbanos del Sur in April 2012.\n\n- Air Comet in March 2008.11\n\nVol. 6, page 994-998.\n\n53.\n\nThe issue for this Tribunal to determine is whether King & Spalding has valid powers of attorney at the present stage of this arbitration, now that each of Claimants\u2019 administrative powers have been suspended. Claimants argue that the powers of attorney are still valid and that the Claimants\u2019 reorganization administrators are simply \"stepping into the shoes\" of Claimants for purposes of the continuation of this arbitration. Respondent argues, to the contrary, that Claimants\u2019 power of attorney was extinguished by the bankruptcy, that a new power of attorney is needed, and that a valid new power of attorney has not yet been granted to King & Spalding or anyone else.\n\n54.\n\nThe bankruptcy of Air Comet and of all three Claimants is related to certain factual and legal disputes in this case. First, Respondent has asserted that Claimants\u2019 bankruptcy terminated King & Spalding\u2019s power of attorney to represent Claimants in this case. Second, the Parties disagree on the causes of Claimants\u2019 and Air Comet\u2019s bankruptcy. Claimants, through witness D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n, assert that the bankruptcies were the direct result of Respondent\u2019s unlawful acts and policies towards the Airlines. Respondent argues that the bankruptcies were due to reasons wholly unconnected to Respondent\u2019s actions, including Claimants\u2019 poor business management, lack of liquidity and failure to make payments. With respect to Air Comet\u2019s bankruptcy, Respondent argues that the company was in a state of bankruptcy as early as April 2008, predating the expropriation of the Airlines later in 2008. These arguments with respect to the causation of the Claimants\u2019 insolvencies are relevant to both Claimants\u2019 claims and Respondent\u2019s counterclaim.\n\n55.\n\nMoreover, Respondent argues that King & Spalding\u2019s attempts to \"ratify\" its power of attorney fail. While Claimants have produced letters written by the trustees in insolvency for each of the Claimants that purport to ratify the power of attorney, Respondent asserts that these letters are flawed. It notes that the letters are not addressed directly to ICSID but rather to the King &Spalding attorneys representing Claimants. It also notes that the letters are undated, and that they do not appear to have been notarized. Finally, Respondent notes that the letters appear to have been executed unilaterally by the trustees, and do not appear to be the result of an order from a commercial court of Madrid. According to Respondent, the trustees lack the right to ratify the acts taken by King & Spalding and to authorize the firm to carry on its activities. Respondent asserts that \"every lawyer is aware that, in order for a power of attorney to be renewed within the context of an insolvency proceeding, there must be a court order authorizing such renewal.\"\n\n56.\n\nClaimants argue that the reorganization administrators \"are not required to seek authorization from the courts hearing Claimants\u2019 reorganization proceedings,\" noting that \"[i]n accordance with Article 51(2) of the Spanish Bankruptcy Law, the court\u2019s authorization would only be required in order to withdraw, to accept a claim, in whole or in part, and to settle disputes\".\n\n57.\n\nWith respect to the power of attorney granted to King & Spalding, Claimants\u2019 expert witness Aurora Martinez Florez asserts that after the suspension of powers, the board of trustees directly steps into the shoes of the debtor in the agreements and powers of attorney granted by the debtor before the declaration of bankruptcy.\n\n58.\n\nWith respect to Article 48(3) of the Bankruptcy Law, which provides that \"Any power of attorney existing at the time of the initiation of the insolvency proceedings shall be affected by the suspension or control of financial and property-related powers,\" Martinez Florez argues that \"affected\" does not mean that powers of attorney are terminated.\n\n59.\n\nThe Respondent\u2019s expert J.J. Cigaran Magan has testified that\n\nPage 987, lines\n\n12... Well, I think that in the courts, it is a  \n 13 basic, essential rule, and any attorney knows that  \n 14 they cannot go to a court without Powers of Attorney  \n 15 granted in notarial instruments.\n\n60.\n\nThe onus was on the Claimants of proving that their standing and the continued capacity of their lawyers to represent them subsisted after the commencement of the insolvency proceedings. This onus has not been discharged. The undated non-notarized letters from the trustees in insolvency which were not directly addressed to this Tribunal cannot be accepted as proof that King & Spalding fulfilled the legal requirement for representing the Claimants after the insolvency proceedings had commenced.\n\n61.\n\nThe issue is further complicated by the third party funding arrangement which exists under the Burford Funding Agreement. The Funding Agreement, with effective date April 14, 2010, is between\n\n(i) Teinver S.A.,\n\n(ii) Transportes de Cercan\u00edas S.A. and\n\n(iii) Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. (all companies incorporated under the laws of Spain and have their principal place of business in Madrid, Spain), and\n\n(i) Burford Capital Limited (described as a \"closed-ended investment company organized under the laws of Guernsey having its principal place of business at Regency Court, Glategny Esplanade, St Peter Port, Guernsey GY1 1 WW\").\n\n62.\n\nThe first point to note is that the Funding Agreement was executed by (i) Gerardo Diaz Ferr\u00e1n and (ii) Gonzalo Pascual Arias. These individuals are not Claimants. It is not understood how these individuals, not being Claimants, could execute the Funding Agreement which states in the recital that\n\n\u2022 Claimant \"requires funding to meet the costs of preparing, submitting and enforcing the Claim\",\n\n\u2022 Claimant \"sought to make arrangements to obtain funds\",\n\n\u2022 Claimant \"has approached the Funder\",\n\n\u2022 and Funder has a \"common legal interest\" with the Claimant.\n\n63.\n\nGonzalo Pascual Arias and Gerardo D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n are persons against whom the Spanish authorities had initiated criminal proceedings for embezzlement, and who have since been convicted by the Spanish Courts. The criminal proceedings against Gonzalo Pascual Arias (now deceased) and Gerardo D\u00edaz Ferr\u00e1n (now convicted and serving sentence in a Spanish prison) is dealt with in a separate section below.\n\n64.\n\nThe Funding Agreement was not executed by Air Comet, which was a party to the SPA and arguably may claim to have made an investment under the BIT. The reason Air Comet did not, and could not, execute the Funding Agreement was that by April 14, 2010 Air Comet was already in insolvency proceedings.\n\n65.\n\nOn January 4, 2010 ICSID informed that parties that the present Tribunal had been constituted. The Funding Agreement, by which Burford got involved in this arbitration, was executed within about four months from the constitution of the Tribunal, and well before the filing of the Claimants\u2019 Memorial on Merits dated September 29, 2010.\n\n66.\n\nThe Funding Agreement states\n\n\"WHEREAS\n\n(A) Burford Capital Limited is an investment company headquartered in Guernsey and publicly traded on the AIM Market of the London Stock Exchange.\n\n(B) The Claimant requires funding to meet the costs of preparing, submitting, conducting and enforcing the Claim (as defined below). The Claimant has therefore sought to make arrangements to obtain funds for such purpose that would allow repayment of such funds to the Funder, plus consideration for the attendant risk, to be conditional upon recovery of proceeds from the Claim.\n\n(C) The Claimant has approached the Funder and for this purpose. The Funder has concluded that the Claim is meritorious and the Funder has a common legal interest with the Claimant in seeing that such Claim is pursued adequately.\"\n\n67.\n\nSchedule 2 of the Funding Agreement states:\n\n\"The Recovery Amount shall be determined and distributed as follows.\n\n1. First, the Expenses paid by the Funder shall be repaid to it and the Funder shall also receive a priority return of three times the Expenses.\n\n2. Any premiums or success fees due to counsel shall be paid.\n\n3. The amount remaining after those payments shall be the \"Net Recovery Amount\" which shall be allocated as follows:\n\n3.1 In the event of a Settlement within twelve month of the Effective Date, 20% of Net Recovery Amount to Funder and the remainder to the Claimant, provided however that the total Recovery Amount payable to the Funder pursuant to section 1 and this section 3.1 shall not exceed 25% of the Award less the Expenses.\n\n3.2 Absent such a settlement,\n\n40% of the first US$100 million of Net Recovery Amount to the Funder,\n\n30% of any Net Recovery Amount between US$100 million and US$500 million to the Funder,\n\n25% of any Net Recovery Amount between US$500 million and US$800 million to the Funder, and\n\n15% of any Net Recovery Amount above US$800 million to the Funder, in each case with the remainder to the Claimant.\n\n4. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Funder shall be entitled [to] receive a minimum amount so as to provide the Funder with an internal rate of return of not less than 50%.\"\n\n68.\n\nClause 6 of the Funding Agreement states\n\n\"6.1 In consideration of the Funder\u2019s undertakings in this Agreement, the Claimant agrees to pay the Funder the Recovery Amount immediately following receipt of all or any part of the Award...\n\n6.2... if the Claimant comes into possession of any Award proceeds, it shall immediately pay all such proceeds immediately to the Nominated Lawyers [King & Spalding LLP] or the escrow agent. The Claimant and the Funder both direct the Nominated Lawyers or the escrow agent to pay the Recovery Amount to the Funder as soon as practicable, to pay any outstanding invoices and to pay the remainder to the Claimant.\"\n\n69.\n\nAs would be evident from the Funding Agreement (in particular clauses 6.1 and 6.2) the Funder, which is not an \"investor\" under the BIT, is intended to be the principal beneficiary, along with the Nominated Lawyers, of the proceeds of any award. The award proceeds are to be immediately paid to the Nominated Lawyers (King & Spalding LLP) or an escrow agent for payment to the Funder and payment of any outstanding invoices (including those of the Nominated Lawyers). Only the remainder will be paid to Claimant.\n\n70.\n\nDespite not being an \"investor\" under the BIT and the funds provided by Burford not being \"protected investment\" under the BIT, these proceedings have continued because Burford and the Nominated Lawyers have been assured of receiving significant amounts from any award which may be made by the ICSID Tribunal. Burford is a third party and as the Respondent states \"is abusing the ICSID system by bringing forward a claim that is contrary to the purposes and goals of the Convention in order to make astronomical profits\".\n\n71.\n\nIn addition, according to Schedule 2, paragraph 4 of the Funding Agreement, Burford is guaranteed an internal rate of return of not less than 50% on its \"investment\".\n\n72.\n\nBurford may have \"invested\" in the present arbitration proceedings by agreeing to fund the legal expenses but such an \"investment\" based on speculating on the prospect of obtaining a substantial portion the proceeds of any award resulting from a pending arbitration cannot be treated as protected \"investment\" under the BIT. The BIT guarantees the rights of \"investors\" who have made an \"investment\" in the territory of the host state. The BIT is not intended to enable payment of awards to third party funders who are not \"investors\" and who have no protected \"investment\", and who only come into the situation in the circumstances described above to advance funds in order to speculate on the outcome of a pending arbitration.\n\n73.\n\nThe practice of third party funding investment arbitration continues to be criticized by academics and professionals. The Funder\u2019s role in this case may well be characterized as \"champerty\", which has long been considered under English common law as being against public policy as it encourages vexatious litigation. A contract may be void for champerty, though it may not strictly amount to criminal offence. The purchase of a law suit by an attorney is champerty in its most odious form as has been held in a judgment of the English Chancery Division:\n\nSo odious in the eyes of the law are these contracts, that they confer no rights on the parties making them, and if one pay out money under them he cannot recover it.12\n\n*Rees v de Bernardy* [1896] 2 Ch 437.\n\n74.\n\nBurford cannot, on any reasonable construction be characterized as an investor entitled to protection under the BIT. The Tribunal cannot, in these circumstances, be considered to have jurisdiction to grant an award to a party, such as Burford, which is not an investor under the BIT and has made no \"investment\" which can claim to be protected by the BIT.\n\n75.\n\nThe questions about how any activities of the Marsans Group can be attributed to the Claimants remain pertinent.\n\n76.\n\nIt was not the Claimants but Air Comet which had entered into the SPA with SEPI. Claimants were not a party to the SPA. The Claimants\u2019 management of the Argentine Airlines is not established, nor have their claim, or what they had \"invested\". The burden of proof was on Claimants and they have failed to discharge it.\n\n77.\n\nAir Comet, the party to the SPA, received from SEPI US$300 million which was to be used for liquidating ARSA\u2019s liabilities. There is no evidence that Air Comet used the funds for the purpose stipulated in the SPA. So there can be no basis for a claim by Air Comet nor by the three named Claimants as indirect shareholders of Air Comet to be treated as an \"investor\".\n\n78.\n\nSince the Marsans Group are not Claimants and indeed the composition and status of the Marsans Group have remained undefined, no alleged contribution of the so-called Marsans Group can be treated as \"investment\" within the meaning of the BIT.\n\n79.\n\nMr Gerardo Diaz Ferran has been found criminally liable and sentenced to two years and two months\u2019 imprisonment by the Judgment of the Spanish Central Criminal Court No.1 (RA 669). The judgment (RA 669) sheds clear light on how through a complex set of transactions the funds which were meant to be applied to liquidate the liabilities of ARSA (and if indeed had they been applied might be treated as an \"investment\") had in fact been misappropriated.\n\n80.\n\nThe relevant portions of the Spanish Court Judgment (RA 669) are reproduced below:\n\n***\"ESTABLISHED FACTS***\n\n*In accordance with the private agreement entered into between AIR COMET and its shareholders on 3 December 2001, which was notarially recorded on the same day, AIR COMET S.A. irrevocably agreed that* *the claims acquired would only be used as funds of its own to increase capital or make irrevocable capital contributions to ARSA and undertook to fulfil such commitment within six months**as from approval of ARSA\u2019s Reorganization Plan. If the claims were not used as agreed upon, SEPI would be entitled to require the parties to repay any sum that was otherwise allocated.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*In view of the fact that the claims assigned to AIR COMET remained effective,* *AIR COMET obtained a bene* *fit* *since these claims were acquired using funds provided by SEPI for no valuable consideration.*\n\nThus no investment can be said to have made by Air Comet. The Spanish Court Judgment (RA 669) further concludes:\n\n\u2026\n\n***CONCLUSIONS OF LA W***\n\n*Nonetheless,* ***in reality, the millions of dollars given by SEPI to meet INTERINVEST\u2019s******liabilities were used by AIR COMET to purchase the claims, thereby subrogating to the rights of ARSA\u2019s creditor and participating in its reorganization proceedings*** *(Report issued by the Spanish Court of Audit).*\n\n\u2026\n\n*It is thus evident that Air* ***Comet was the only holder of the claims acquired through the USD 300 million provided by SEPI.***\n\n\u2026\n\n*In accordance with the agreement of 3 December 2001 between AIR COMET and its shareholders (Transportes de Cercan\u00edas, Busursa, Segetur and Viajes Marsans), the company* [Air Comet] *undertook to acquire a series of claims* [debts]to *be paid by ARSA, thus subrogating to the rights of the creditors.*\n\nIt may be noted that the two of the three named Claimants were not shareholders of Air Comet at the relevant time. Regarding the fraud committed by Air Comet the Spanish Court Judgment (RA 669) noted:\n\n*... The claims acquired were used to increase ARSA\u2019s capital. Therefore,* ***AIR COMET******ended up increasing its stake in ARSA by using funds granted by SEPI to INTERINVEST,*** *which were aimed at paying ARSA \u2019s liabdities.*\n\n*...In fact, since AIR COMET acquired the claims \u2014assets\u2014 without having the necessary funds to do so \u2014with funds granted by INTERINVEST\u2014* ***this was actually an assignment******for no consideration, a gift or a case of unjust enrichment,*** *if not a mere present given by the donor. The ultimate beneficiary was AIR COMET, since it was its value that increased, and this fact cannot be concealed.*\n\n\u2026\n\n*The claims were not settled. If they had, they would have produced no benefits, which is the theory advanced by the accused at trial in stating that Air Comet was \"a simple agent\". However, since those claims remained effective, Air Comet, in acquiring them, received the benefit deriving from its inclusion as a new creditor in ARSA\u2019s**reorganization.*\n\n*...In this respect, Judgment STS 979/2011 should be highlighted, among others: \"The companies constitute a business structure that is controlled by a single person (in this case, the accused and their companies). There is no separation of assets in the conduct of their business that justifies the conclusion that they operate independently of each other. Their respective personalities are nothing but a front.* ***There is actually a single******economic structure that is used to commit fraud or to harm a third party and thus cannot enjoy the protection granted by the law*** *to an entity that has a legal personality of its own \".*\n\n81.\n\nFrom the above judgment the following facts become clear that under the SPA by which Air Comet obtained shares of Interinvest for USD 1, SEPI had provided USD300,000 for the reduction of liabilities of Argentine Airlines and Air Comet had undertaken to utilize that amount for the specific purpose of reduction of liabilities of Argentine Airlines. This was not done.\n\n82.\n\nDespite contributions by SEPI for reducing the liabilities of ARSA the fact is that ARSA remained indebted since the obligations undertaken by Air Comet in the SPA were not fulfilled. The assertion that Air Comet \"invested\" that amount is, in fact, palpably unwarranted. The millions of dollars given by SEPI to meet Interinvest\u2019s liabilities were not so used but were used by Air Comet to purchase the claims. This cannot be treated as an investment of Air Comet in the Argentine Airlines.\n\n83.\n\nThe effect of this transaction was that the Interinvest\u2019s liabilities (and Argentine Airlines\u2019 liabilities) continued to be liabilities while Air Comet illegally acquired claims over the Argentine Airlines through fraudulent means.\n\n84.\n\nThrough the fraud so committed harm was caused to the Argentine Airlines to the extent that SEPI funds meant for reducing the liabilities of the Argentine Airlines were not so used, but were actually used to increase the share capital of Air Comet. Such a misuse of the funds which were intended to reduce the liabilities, but were misappropriated, cannot be regarded as Claimants\u2019 \"investment\".\n\n85.\n\nAir Comet\u2019s acquisition has been found by the Spanish Court to have been **\"an****assignment for no consideration, a gift or a case of unjust enrichment\".**\n\n86.\n\nThe Spanish Court has found that in this transaction there is **\"actually a single economic****structure that is used to commit fraud or to harm a third party [the Argentine****Airlines] and thus cannot enjoy the protection granted by the law\".**\n\n87.\n\nIn such a situation, where a Spanish Court has found that a fraud had been committed by Air Comet and Mr Ferran to harm the Argentine Airlines, it cannot be legally tenable to treat such misuse of the funds as an \"investment\" which may seek the protection of the BIT.\n\n**ALLEGED BREACHES OF THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT PROVISION**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nMy concerns regarding the identity of the Claimants are also relevant in assessing the Memorandum of Agreement signed between the Government of Argentina and Interinvest (\"the July 2008 Agreement\").13\n\nClaimant\u2019s Exhibit C-190.\n\n89.\n\nThe crucial issue remains that none of the three Claimants were parties to this July 2008 Agreement and thus had no rights under the July 2008 Agreement. As Professor Kinsbury has stated in his expert opinion an investor cannot invoke commitments under an agreement unless it is \"a contract between the Claimant and the Government\". I am in agreement with Professor Kinsbury and am of the view that since none of the three named Claimants were parties to the July 2008 Agreement they cannot claim for contractual breaches of that July 2008 Agreement. Further, in Professor Kinsbury\u2019s opinion a simple breach of contract cannot be regarded as a breach of the BIT.14\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, Para 134.\n\n90.\n\nThe issue is whether the Claimants can claim a treaty breach under the BIT for any violations of the July 2008 Agreement between Interinvest and the Argentine Government. If there was a breach Interinvest, being an Argentine company, could not claim under the Spain-Argentina BIT. Air Comet, the Spanish shareholders of Interinvest, did not lodge any claims before this Tribunal and are not the Claimants. I am of the view that Claimants do not have standing to bring claims for treaty breaches for any alleged violations of the contractual terms of the July 2008 Agreement by Argentina.\n\n91.\n\nThe factual and legal context of the July 2008 Agreement is important in order to assess breaches of the Claimants\u2019 treaty rights by the Respondent.\n\n92.\n\nThe July 2008 Agreement was executed between Argentina and Interinvest since a potential investor, Mr. Mena, withdrew and \"the reason Mr. Lopex Mena withdrew from the acquisition of the Airlines was that he could never have sufficient information of the economic, financial and operational situation of the Airlines because, as was said, the Marsans Group did not provide the necessary information\".15\n\nExhibit RA 555; Respondent\u2019s PHB, Para 144.\n\n93.\n\nIt is important that the July 2008 Agreement is not an agreement for sale of shares. The price of the shares which were to be transferred from Interinvest, arguably the most crucial element of any transfer of shares, remained to be agreed between Interinvest and the Respondent.\n\n94.\n\nThe main disagreement between Interinvest and Argentina that led to the failure of the July 2008 Agreement was the price valuation of the Argentine Airlines. Regardless of the price valuation, it was an agreed position that the financial condition of the Argentine Airlines was very bad - Respondent characterizes the Airlines as being \"in truly bankrupt condition\"16 and Claimants assert that by mid 2008 \"the Argentine Airline\u2019s financial condition hit its worst point since Claimants acquired them in October 2001\"17. It may be pertinent that in 2001 when the SPA was executed the valuation of the Argentine Airlines was US$1. If the financial position in July 2008 was worse than that in 2001 then it appears that the Respondent\u2019s negative valuation (as conducted by TTN) of the Airlines is more credible than the Claimants\u2019 non-independent valuation conducted by Credit Suisse.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, Para 478; Respondent\u2019s Rejoinder, Para 466.\n\nClaimant\u2019s Reply, Para 287.\n\n95.\n\nSince the price of the shares was not agreed between Interinvest and the Respondent, I cannot agree with the conclusion in paragraph 782 of the Award that the July 2008 memorandum \"constituted a binding agreement between Interinvest and the Government of Argentina pursuant to which the two parties agreed to the purchase and sale of Interinvest\u2019s shares in the Airlines on the terms set out in the Agreement\". Since the price was not agreed, the memorandum of July 2008 (referred to as July 2008 Agreement) cannot be treated as a binding agreement for the sale and purchase of the Airlines. A binding agreement for sale was yet to be reached upon agreement of the price between the parties. The failure to reach an agreement cannot be treated as a breach of the treaty rights of the Claimants. There was no guarantee from the Government that the shares of the Airlines would be purchased. The July 2008 Agreement was merely an agreement to explore for a limited period of 60 days the possibility of a purchase of shares provided that the price valuation could be carried out.\n\n96.\n\nThe failure of the parties to agree to appoint an independent expert cannot be attributed as a treaty breach of the Claimants\u2019 rights under the BIT by the Respondent. The Respondent has consistently held that Interinvest failed to provide financial information required under the July 2008 Agreement.18 Mr Munoz Perez also confirmed that even Credit Suisse valuation was done on the basis of a \"Business Plan\" prepared by \"the Board of Directors of the Marsans Group\".19 A credible valuation by Credit Suisse would have required the auditors to independently to verify or carry out any audit the documents. This was not done. I cannot agree with the Tribunal that Respondent\u2019s complaints regarding the Credit Suisse valuation were formal and artificial.\n\nRespondent\u2019s Rejoinder, paras 490-493; Respondent\u2019s Counter Memorial, paras 507-508; Respondent\u2019s PHB, Para 159-162.\n\nRespondent\u2019s PHB, Para 40, citing testimony of M Perez, transcript p.489.\n\n97.\n\nam of the view that the 2008 Agreement contained no commitments from the Respondent to the three named Claimants. The 2008 Agreement was not a binding agreement for the sale of shares but was a memorandum to explore the option of the sale of shares provided the price of the shares could be agreed at and other conditions could be met within a transition period of 60 days, which expired on 14 October 2008. For these reasons, the 2008 Agreement cannot be the basis of finding a treaty breach of obligations owed to the three named Claimants by the Respondent.\n\n98.\n\nIn conclusion, for all the reasons stated above, I consider and find that this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to grant reliefs under the Argentina-Spain Treaty to the Claimants in the form of declarations set out in paragraphs 1148 (a)-(c) or the directions set out in paragraphs 1148 (d)-(g) of the majority award, as Claimants have failed to establish that they are investors entitled to protection under the Treaty or that their investments in respect of which protection was sought are protected investments under the Treaty. With due respect to my co-arbitrators, I cannot concur in the majority award and enter this dissenting opinion."}], "Content": "Decision on Rectification (Excerpts)\n------------------------------------\n\n**I. INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n------------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 18 April 2017, the Arbitral Tribunal composed of Prof Hans van Houtte, Mr V.V. Veeder, and Mr Mauro Rubino-Sammartano rendered the Award in *Marco Gavazzi and Stefano Gavazzi* v. *Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/12/15) (the **\"Award\").** A Decision on Jurisdiction, Admissibility and Liability dated 21 April 2015 formed part of the Award.\n\n2.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to pay to the Claimants: (1) [...] and [...] as compensation for violation of Article 4 of the BIT; (2) 100% of the Claimants\u2019 legal costs, and the fees and expenses of witnesses presented by the Claimants other than Deloitte before April 2015 and [...] of the fees and expenses of Deloitte and the Claimants\u2019 legal costs after April 2015, totaling [...] and [...]; (3) pre-award compound interest on the amount of compensation from the date of violation to the date of the Award; and (4) post-award compound interest on the amounts of both the compensation and legal costs from the date of the Award until full payment. The Award was accompanied by a Dissenting Opinion of Mr Mauro Rubino-Sammartano.\n\n3.\n\nBy a Request for Rectification dated 8 May 2017 (the **\"Request\")** made pursuant to Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 49, the Claimants asked the Tribunal \"to *rectify the arithmetical or similar error[s] in the award,... and clarify and rectify the text of the Award\"1*\n\nRequest, para. 4.\n\n4.\n\nFollowing receipt of the lodging fee, on 12 May 2017, the Secretary-General registered the Request pursuant to Rule 49(2)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules. On the same date, the Secretary-General transmitted a copy of the notice of registration and of the Request to each Member of the Tribunal.\n\n5.\n\nOn 16 May 2017, the Tribunal invited the Respondent\u2019s written observations on the Request. The Respondent filed its observations on 30 May 2017 (the **\"Observations\").**\n\n6.\n\nOn 30 May 2017, the Claimants sought the opportunity to file further comments on the Respondent\u2019s Observations, to which the Respondent objected. Before the Tribunal decided on the request, on 31 May 2017, the Claimants stated in an email that they withdrew the request but nevertheless provided comments (including an amendment of one of the rectification requests) and a new table concerning their legal costs (see below, paragraph 21).\n\n7.\n\nOn 31 May 2017, the Tribunal admitted the Claimants\u2019 further comments of the same date (the **\"Response\")** and invited the Respondent to file a further reply by 6 June 2017. The Respondent filed its reply as scheduled (the **\"Reply\").** In the Reply, the Respondent objected to the admissibility of a new document filed by the Claimants with their Response.\n\n8.\n\nBy letter of 12 June 2017, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Parties\u2019 second round submissions and stated that it would decide on the admissibility of the new document attached to the Claimants\u2019 Response in the Decision on Rectification.\n\n**II. CLAIMANTS\u2019 POSITION**\n---------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**III. RESPONDENT\u2019S POSITION**\n------------------------------\n\n[...]\n\n**IV. ANALYSIS**\n----------------\n\n50.\n\nArticle 49(2) of the ICSID Convention provides, in relevant part, as follows:\n\n*The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered may after notice to the other party decide any question which it had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award....*\n\n51.\n\nArbitration Rule 49 provides that:\n\n*(1) Within 45 days after the date on which the award was rendered, either party may request, pursuant to Article 49(2) of the Convention, a supplementary decision on, or the rectification of, the award. Such a request shall be addressed in writing to the Secretary-General. The request shall:*\n\n*(a) identify the award to which it relates;*\n\n*(b) indicate the date of the request;*\n\n*(c) state in detail:*\n\n*(i) any question which, in the opinion of the requesting party, the Tribunal omitted to decide in the award; and*\n\n*(ii) any error in the award which the requesting party seeks to have rectified; and*\n\n*(d) be accompanied by a fee for lodging the request.*\n\n*(2) Upon receipt of the request and of the lodging fee, the Secretary-General shall forthwith:*\n\n*(a) register the request;*\n\n*(b) notify the parties of the registration;*\n\n*(c) transmit to the other party a copy of the request and of any accompanying documentation; and*\n\n*(d) transmit to each member of the Tribunal a copy of the notice of registration, together with a copy of the request and of any accompanying documentation.*\n\n*(3) The President of the Tribunal shall consult the members on whether it is necessary for the Tribunal to meet in order to consider the request. The Tribunal shall fix a time limit for the parties to file their observations on the request and shall determine the procedure for its consideration.*\n\n*(4) Rules 46-48 shall apply,* mutatis mutandis, *to any decision of the Tribunal pursuant to this Rule.*\n\n*(5) If a request is received by the Secretary-General more than 45 days after the award was rendered, he shall refuse to register the request and so inform forthwith the requesting party.*\n\n52.\n\nThere is no dispute between the Parties that the Request was filed within the prescribed time limit and accompanied by the relevant lodging fee. It is also not disputed that rectification is a recourse available to the parties as a matter of right under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n53.\n\nHowever, the Parties disagree on whether or not the Request is admissible in view of the scope and purpose of Article 49 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 49. They also disagree on the substance of the requested rectifications.\n\n**A. Standard for Rectification**\n---------------------------------\n\n54.\n\nArticle 49 of the ICSID Convention prescribes narrow grounds on which an award may be rectified, namely when there is *\"any clerical, arithmetical or similar error in the award\"* The Tribunal agrees with the standard for rectification set out in *Gold Reserve :*\n\n*[t]he purpose of the correction exception to the functus officio principle is to correct obvious omissions or mistakes and avoid a consequence where a party finds itself bound by an award that orders relief the tribunal did not intend to grant. The purpose is therefore to ensure that the true intentions of the tribunal are given effect in the award, but not to alter those intentions, amend the legal analysis, modify reasoning or alter findings. An authoritative commentary confirms that the correction facility found in most arbitral rules is to be used to correct miscalculation or unintended errors of expression and that \"that remedy cannot be used to alter the meaning of the decision. \" Any purported correction that goes beyond the scope of the Tribunal\u2019s limited mandate in this regard is likely to be subject to challenge.3*\n\n*Gold Reserve Inc.* v. *Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/l) (*\"Gold Reserve\"),* Decision Regarding the Claimant\u2019s and the Respondent\u2019s Requests for Corrections, 15 December 2014, para. 38. Whilst this was a Decision under Article 56 of the Additional Facility (Arbitration Rules), the provision is similar to that under the ICSID Convention.\n\n55.\n\nThe Respondent has referred to a number of ICSID Decisions on Rectification which appear to state that rectification may only be made with regard to a *minor* error. First, as noted by the Respondent, the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules do not expressly set out such a limitation. Second, none of the Decisions suggest that a mathematical error cannot be rectified if the error in calculation is significant compared to the amount awarded.\n\n56.\n\nIn the Tribunal\u2019s view, an obvious mistake is discernible through the ease with which the error may be identified and remedied. In other words, it is not the impact on the outcome of the Award that is determinative. For example, an omission which leads to a five figure number instead of a six figure number would amount to a rectifiable error if such an error were obvious from the face of the Award. However, the rectification must not affect the merits of the Decision, and must not lead to a complex exercise to retrace or clarify the parties\u2019 arguments and evidence on the text to be rectified. The purpose of a rectification proceeding is not to correct any errors made by the parties, but rather those of the tribunal (even where a party may have contributed in part to the tribunal\u2019s own error).\n\n57.\n\nBy way of example, tribunals and *ad hoc* committees have made the following rectifications:\n\n\u2022 In several cases, the tribunal or *ad hoc* committee has corrected an error in the listing of the names of the Parties\u2019 representatives.4\n\n\u2022 In *Railroad Development Corporation,* the Tribunal corrected an arithmetical error in the calculation of net present value pursuant to the applicable discount rate, where it was \"*evident that the Tribunal misapplied the discount rate\"5*\n\n\u2022 In *Compan\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, S.A.,* the Rectification Decision corrected an error in a sentence of an award stating that that the memorial had *not* been accompanied by supporting documentation when it had been accompanied by supporting documentation (i.e., the word \u2019not\u2019 was deleted from the relevant sentence). The rectification decision in that case also changed a name used in error in the identification of a witness.6\n\n\u2022 In *Vivendi,* the tribunal substituted \"Claimant\" for \"Respondent\" and deleted the words \"and neither party disputes\" from its summary of a point of law, noting that Respondent had, in fact, argued the points in question and had not formally abandoned those arguments.7\n\nIn *Industria Nacional de Alimentos, SA. and Indalsa Per\u00fa, SA. (formerly Empresas Lucchetti, SA. and Lucchetti Per\u00fa, SA.)* v. *Republic of Peru* (ICSID Case No ARB/03/4), Rectification of the Decision on Annulment of the ad hoc Committee, 30 November 2007, the *ad hoc* committee corrected the incorrect listing of an independent co-counsel as a member of another law firm. The *ad hoc* committee in *Hussein Nuaman Soufraki* v. *United Arab Emirates* (ICSID Case No ARB/02/7), Rectification of the Decision of the ad hoc Committee on the Application for Annulment of Mr. Soufraki, 13 August 2007, similarly corrected the title page of an annulment decision to include the name of counsel that liad been omitted in error. Finally, in *Noble Ventures, Inc.* v. *Romania* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11), Rectification of Award, 19 May 2006, the rectification addressed a counsel\u2019s name omitted from the page of the award listing the parties\u2019 representatives.\n\n*Railroad Development Corporation (RDC)* v. *Republic of Guatemala* (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/23) *(\"Railroad Development Corporation\u2019),* Decision regarding the Claimant\u2019s Request for a Supplementary Decision and Rectification of the Award, 18 January 2013, para. 43.\n\n*Compa\u00f1ia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena SA.* v. *Republic of Costa Rica* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/1) *(\"Compa\u00f1\u00eda del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, SA.* Rectification of Award, 8 June 2000.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquij a S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A.* v. *Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3) (\u201f *Vivendi\"),* Decision of the *ad hoc* Committee on the Request for Supplementation and Rectification of its Decision Concerning Annulment of the Award, 28 May 2003.\n\n**B. Admissibility of New Documents**\n-------------------------------------\n\n58.\n\nConsistent with the limited scope of a rectification request under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal is of the view that no new documents may be filed by the parties in the rectification proceedings. If new evidence or demonstrative aids are necessary to show an error in the award, the above standard for rectification of an obvious mistake is likely not met. In the instant case, the Tribunal therefore upholds the objection of Respondent and decides not to admit the Claimants\u2019 new table attached to the Response of 31 May 2017.\n\n**C. Arithmetical Error Relating to the Compensation for Breach of Article 4 of the BIT**\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n59.\n\nThe following analysis reflects the view and decision of the majority of the Tribunal.\n\n60.\n\nIt is clear from the face of the Award that the Claimants\u2019 investment consisted of the share price paid and other capital invested by the Claimants. The share price was [...] (paragraph 127 of the Award) and the other capital invested amounted to [...] and [...] (paragraph 130 of the Award). As stated in paragraph 130 of the Award, these amounts were to be added. The \"capital invested\" should have thus amounted to [,..]and [...]. However, by error, the purchase price of the shares was omitted from subsequent calculations.\n\n61.\n\nAsa result, at paragraph 232 of the Award, the correct USD amount should have been 50% of [... ]. This arithmetical error thus led to an omission of the amount of [... ]for the loss of opportunity.8\n\nThe Claimants state in the Request (paragraphs 14, 18, 19) that [...]of the share price of [...] would amount to [... ]. However, the Tribunal notes that such amount should be increased by [... ] to [... ].\n\n62.\n\nAt paragraph 337(1), the USD amount again omitted, by error, to include the share purchase price [,..]and 50% of that amount for the loss of opportunity ([...]). As a result, this arithmetical error led to an omission of the amount of [... ] in total, and the correct figure should have amounted to [... ].\n\n63.\n\nIn these circumstances, as to the Claimants\u2019 first request, it is manifestly clear that the Tribunal made an arithmetical error in omitting to include the share price in the calculations at paragraphs 232 and 337(1) of the Award. The Tribunal\u2019s intention to include the share purchase price in the calculations is obvious from paragraphs 127 and 130 of the Award. The Tribunal must therefore rectify the Award accordingly, as requested by the Claimants.\n\n**D. Arithmetical Error in the Calculation of Legal Costs and Other Expenses**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nIn the Award, the Tribunal noted that Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention confers wide discretion on a tribunal to allocate the costs of an arbitration between the parties as it deems appropriate. On that basis, the Tribunal granted the Claimants 100% of their legal costs in the first phase of the proceeding (i.e. before April 2015), excluding the fees and expenses of Deloitte. These pre-April 2015 costs were calculated based on an Annex to the Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs, as noted in footnote 322 of the Award.9 In particular, the Tribunal relied on summary table in the Annex which contained the amounts of invoices for the relevant period. Based on the table in the Annex, the pre-2015 legal costs amounted to [...].\n\nThe relevant footnote provided that *\"This figure [...] has been determined on the basis of the invoices included in the Annex to the Claimants\u2019 Submissions on Costs dated 28 July 2016 which pre-date 21 April 2015, including outstanding invoices which relate to sendees provided during the first phase of the arbitration (i.e., Sect 2.1 invoice nos. G/l-G/7 and Section 4.1 invoice nos. 1-3), but excluding the [...]invoices listed in Section 3.\"* The Tribunal notes that the text in parentheticals *\"(i.e., Sect 2.1 invoice nos. G/l-G/7 and Section 4.1 invoice nos. 1-3/\u2019* refers to only those invoices which were outstanding but related to services performed in the first phase. The text in parentheticals does not refer to the already incurred expenses in the relevant time period listed in Sections 2.2, 2.3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5.\n\n65.\n\nThe Request sought the rectification of the Claimants\u2019 legal costs, namely that such costs be increased from to [...]. In their Response, the Claimants revised the amount, stating that the Claimants\u2019 legal costs for the first phase should instead be[...], (a reduction of [..,]from the figure contained in the Request). Although the Tribunal has not admitted the updated table provided by the Claimants (see above paragraph 58), the Tribunal understands that such document, described as a \"Revised Detail of Costs\" has been supplied to support the Claimants\u2019 revised calculation, and further notes that the Claimants have during this phase identified errors within their own Cost Submission.10\n\nRequest, footnotes 5 and 6\n\n66.\n\nIt appears from the above that the Claimants\u2019 Submission on Costs contained some inconsistencies between the table in the Annex and the invoices which were attached, and that this is the primary reason which led to a difference in the amount arrived at in the Award and in the Claimants\u2019 Response. In addition, the Claimants\u2019 submissions during this phase acknowledge inconsistencies within the Claimants\u2019 cost submissions. Further inconsistencies arose during this rectification proceeding, as demonstrated by the adjustment in the Claimants\u2019 own calculations in their Response. The Tribunal assumes that this is the reason why the Claimants filed an amended table.\n\n67.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it was entitled to rely on the cost submission filed by the Claimants; including the table of costs which formed the basis of the amount sought by the Claimants. A consequent correction of the total invoice amounts as listed in the table would result in a compensation *ultra petita.* In view of that, and the fact that the Tribunal would need to correct an error that was based on a party\u2019s error and not its own error, the Tribunal considers that the request for rectification does not meet the standard set out above under the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal would need to investigate further the Claimants\u2019 own calculations during the rectification phase and rely on new documentation to address such calculations. This is not the correction of a simple arithmetical error but a more complex exercise into the evidence filed compared to other figures filed. This does thus not amount to a clerical, arithmetical or similar error by the Tribunal made in the Award.\n\n68.\n\nThe Claimants\u2019 second request to rectify the figure in paragraph 333 of the Award is therefore rejected. The Tribunal also rejects the request to rectify the list in parenthesis of footnote 322 of the Award.\n\n**E. Clerical Error with Regard to VAT**\n----------------------------------------\n\n69.\n\nAs to the Claimants\u2019 third request, paragraph 309 of the Award describes the statement of costs which was submitted by the Claimants on 27 August 2014 following the hearing on jurisdiction, admissibility and liability:\n\n*In their cost submission relating to the proceedings concerning jurisdiction, admissibility and the merits dated 27 August 2014, the Claimants stated that they had advanced [...] to ICSID and incurred [...] on account of their legal and other fees and expenses. They also claimed Italian VAT 22% on that amount, however, this request was dropped in their cost submission of 28 July 2016.*\n\nThe Claimants request that the Tribunal remove the last sentence of above paragraph (i.e. *\"They also claimed Italian VAT 22% on that amount, however, this request was dropped in their cost submission of 28 July 2016\")* on the basis that the Claimants\u2019 claim for VAT was not dropped in their July 2016 cost submission (or otherwise).\n\n70.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the August 2014 cost submission filed by the Claimants separately listed VAT as a category of costs which the Claimant sought to recover, and in this way expressly stated that VAT was being requested. In contrast, the Claimants\u2019 August 2016 submission on costs did not explicitly address VAT or separately list VAT as a category of the Claimants\u2019 fees and expenses. The Tribunal notes, however, that a number of the invoice amounts which were listed in summary table in the Annex to the submission were inclusive of VAT as the Claimants have emphasized during the rectification proceeding (the Claimants have also noted during this proceeding that some of the fee amounts listed in the Claimants\u2019 table omitted VAT).\n\n71.\n\nIn the August 2014 cost submission, the Claimants claimed Italian VAT 22% on the amount of costs requested, however, in their Cost Submission of 28 July 2016 Claimants did not maintain a claim for VAT under a specific heading, nor did they systematically include VAT in the claimed amounts. Therefore, it is not obvious that the Tribunal made an error in the Award regarding the VAT claimed, and the Tribunal therefore rejects this third request by the Claimants.\n\n**F. Clarification of Compound Interest**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n72.\n\nThe Claimants ask that the Tribunal reword paragraph 337(4) in the operative part of the Award to include the following text in brackets: *\"Orders the Respondent to pay to the Claimants compound interest on the amounts established in the sub-paragraphs 1* *[as they result by the application of interests in accordance with sub-paragraph 3 above]**and 2. above; interest shall accrue...\"* (emphasis added). At the same time, the Claimants state that it is self-evident that paragraph 337(4) of the Award refers to the amount under paragraph 337(1), as increased by accrued pre-award compound interest under paragraph 337(3).\n\n73.\n\nThe Respondent states that the meaning of the operative part of the Award is clear and cannot support the Claimants\u2019 fourth request.\n\n74.\n\nThe Claimants have not specified any error in paragraph 337(4) of the Award. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that the change requested by the Claimants is not a \"rectification\" within the meaning of Arbitration Rule 49. The requested amendment to paragraph 337(4) of the Award is an attempt to \"clarify\" its meaning and not to rectify its wording. The Claimants\u2019 fourth request is therefore denied.\n\n**V. COSTS**\n------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Respondent has requested that the Tribunal award the costs incurred by it in connection with this rectification proceeding. The Claimants have not claimed costs in the Request or the Response.\n\n76.\n\nIn accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rules 47(1)(j) and 49(5), this Decision is to contain the Tribunal\u2019s determination concerning the cost of the proceeding.\n\n77.\n\nThe costs and expenses of the original arbitration proceeding led to a depletion of the available funds in this case. The Tribunal does not wish to prolong these rectification proceedings by requesting additional advances from the Parties. The Tribunal has therefore decided to waive its fees in this rectification proceeding. No other costs are charged to the Parties.\n\n78.\n\nTaking into account the Tribunal\u2019s decision, which resulted in one arithmetical rectification to the Award, and the rejection of other rectifications, the Tribunal determines that each Party shall bear its own legal and other costs. There are no costs charged to the Parties for the costs of the rectification proceeding and therefore no costs to be allocated.\n\n**VI. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n79.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, the Tribunal decides:\n\n1. By majority, to rectify the Award as follows:\n\na. The amount in paragraph 232 line 10 ([...]) shall be deleted and replaced by [...].\n\nb. The amount in paragraph 232 line 11 ([...]) shall be deleted and replaced by [...].\n\nc. The amount in paragraph 337(1) first line ([...]) shall be deleted and replaced by [...].\n\n2. To reject the remaining three requests for rectification.\n\n3. That each Party shall bear its own legal and other costs.\n\nA dissenting opinion by Arbitrator Mauro Rubino-Sammartano is attached hereto, as required by ICSID Arbitration Rules 47(3) and 49(4)."}]}
