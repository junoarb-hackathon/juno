THE PARTIES**\n------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (**ICSID)** on the basis of the Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Italy on the Promotion and Protection of Investments which was signed on 22 May 1990, and entered into force on 14 October 1993 (the **BIT**)1 and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the **ICSID Convention**).\n\nTreaty between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Italy on the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 22 May 1990, entered into force 14 October 1993; C-0001. There are discrepancies in various versions of the English translation of the BIT exhibited in this arbitration. Translations used in this Decision are the Tribunal's; however, the Tribunal has had regard to the authentic Italian and Spanish versions of the BIT in reaching its Decision.\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Salini Impregilo S.p.A. (**Salini Impregilo** or **Claimant**), an Italian industrial group specialising in large civil engineering projects, incorporated under Italian law.2 On 26 November 2013 Salini S.p.A. merged by incorporation into Impregilo S.p.A. On 1 January 2014 Impregilo S.p.A. changed its name to Salini Impregilo S.p.A.3\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [5].\n\nIbid, para [5].\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Argentine Republic (**Argentina** or **Respondent**).\n\n4.\n\nIn 1995, Argentina started a bidding process for the construction, operation and maintenance of a bridge and toll road in its territory.4 Impregilo S.p.A. (now Salini Impregilo) formed a Consortium with other investors and won the concession.5\n\nIbid, para [14].\n\nIbid, para [18]. The Consortium was made up of: Impregilo S.p.A., Iglys S.A., Hochtief A.G., Vorm Begr Helfmann, Techint Compania Internacional S.A.C.e I. and Benito Roggio e Hijos S.A.: Argentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [13].\n\n5.\n\nOn 28 January 1998, Salini Impregilo, the other Consortium partners and Argentina executed the Concession Contract (**Concession Contract**).6 The Concession Contract provided for an Argentine state subsidy to be paid during the project's construction, among other funding sources.7\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [19].\n\nIbid, para [21]; Argentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras [13], [15].\n\n6.\n\nThe Concession Contract required that the Consortium partners incorporate a local Argentine company for the purpose of performing the contract. Puentes del Litoral S.A. (**Puentes**) was duly incorporated on 1 April 1998.8 Salini Impregilo is a shareholder in Puentes, owning 26% of its stock (22% is directly owned and 4% is indirectly owned through its subsidiary, Iglys S.A.).9 Salini Impregilo and its consortium partners gave up their rights and obligations under the contract by transferring them to Puentes on 17 June 1998.10 On 14 September 1998, Puentes, as Concessionaire, signed the Concession Contract.11\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [20].\n\nIbid, paras [3], [20].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [20]; Argentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [136]; Exhibit RA-004 (Deed of Transfer).\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [14]; Exhibit RA-005 (Takeover Certificate).\n\n7.\n\nSalini Impregilo invested US$36 million in the project, including equity and debt. Salini Impregilo alleges that Argentina failed to pay subsidies due under the Concession Contract.12 Salini Impregilo further alleges that Argentina enacted emergency legislation on 6 January 2002, which had the effect of reducing the toll revenue from the project and the project's economic viability.13 The measures included the de-pegging of the Argentine peso from the US dollar and converting public contract obligations denominated in US dollars into Argentine pesos (at a rate of AR$1 to US$1).14\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, paras [3], [22], and [66]. Salini Impregilo alleges that by March 2001 Argentina owed Puentes US$65 million in unpaid subsidies.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Memorial on the Merits, para [62].\n\nIbid; Salini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [24].\n\n8.\n\nThe emergency legislation also provided that public service concessionaires had to comply with their obligations under existing agreements and further included an order that the government renegotiate public contracts affected by the emergency legislation within 180 days.15 The Argentine government established a special agency, UNIREN,16 to renegotiate public service and infrastructure concessions.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [25] and Memorial on the Merits, para [62].\n\nThis was a 'Public Works and Services Contracts Renegotiation Commission' under the purview of the Ministry of Economy and Ministry of Planning, Public Investment and Services: Salini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [37].\n\n9.\n\nAccording to Salini Impregilo, Argentina officially started the renegotiation process in March 2002. Thereafter, Salini Impregilo alleges that Puentes asked Argentina to complete renegotiation at least 25 times during the following years.17 Puentes and the Argentine government negotiated two Memoranda of Understanding and four transitory agreements between 2002 and 2012 to try to restore the economic balance of the Concession Contract.18 According to Salini Impregilo none of these six agreements were ever put into effect by Argentina.19\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [34].\n\nIbid, paras [34]-[43].\n\nIbid, paras [35]-[43].\n\n10.\n\nOn 11 June 2013, Puentes filed an administrative complaint against Argentina for breaches of the Concession Contract.20 On 30 May 2014 Puentes filed a lawsuit in an Argentine court.21 In June 2014 Puentes' board resolved to dissolve the company. In August 2014 Argentina issued a decree terminating the Concession Contract, citing, among other things, Puentes' bankruptcy and resolution to dissolve the company.22\n\nExhibit C-0049.\n\nExhibit C-0009.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, paras [45]-[46] ; Exhibit C-0051.\n\n11.\n\nThe bridge now operates under a new concession granted by Argentina to a third party.23\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [46].\n\n12.\n\nSalini Impregilo argues that Argentina violated the BIT and destroyed the economic viability of Salini Impregilo's investment in Puentes, effectively expropriating Salini Impregilo's investment.24 Salini Impregilo alleges that Argentina breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment, the most favoured nation clause (MFN), the standard of nondiscrimination and the standard of non-expropriation contained in the BIT.25\n\nIbid, paras [2]-[3].\n\nIbid, para [10]; Argentina, Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [71]; Salini Impregilo, Memorial on the Merits, para [177].\n\n13.\n\nOn a preliminary basis (having not yet filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits) Argentina argues that the concessionaire, Puentes, was in breach of its obligation to obtain the required financing to build the project and that Puentes was adversely affected by bankruptcy proceedings against it (unrelated to action by the Argentine government).26\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [28].\n\n**II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n--------------------------\n\n14.\n\nIn 1997, Salini Impregilo formed a consortium with a German construction company, Hochtief AG, and several other construction companies (the **Consortium**).\n\n15.\n\nThat same year, the Consortium participated in a Bid for a 25-year contract for the construction, maintenance and operation of a toll road between the cities of Rosario and Victoria in Argentina (the **Project**). In November 1997, the Consortium won the Bid.27\n\nSalini Impregilo, Memorial on the Merits, paras [43], [46]; Argentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [13].\n\n16.\n\nThe Consortium formed Puentes del Litoral S.A., a locally-incorporated company. The Claimant owned 26% of the shares in Puentes.\n\n17.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that several measures taken by the Argentine government starting in 2002 led to its economic asphyxiation which concluded with the termination of the Concession Contract in 2014.\n\n18.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that *first*, this was a State-funded Project and that Argentina fulfilled its obligations under the Concession Contract, and *secondly*, that it was the Claimant which breached its obligations by not complying with the requirements under the Concession Contract.\n\n**III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n---------------------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request**\n----------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nOn 1 September 2015, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date, from the Claimant against the Respondent (the **Request for Arbitration**).\n\n20.\n\nOn 17 September 2015, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and notified the parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, pursuant to Rule 7(c) of the ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (**ICSID Institution Rules**), the Acting Secretary-General invited the parties to inform the Centre of any agreed provisions as to the number of arbitrators and the method for their appointment. He further invited the parties to constitute the Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**B. Constitution of the Tribunal**\n-----------------------------------\n\n21.\n\nOn 23 November 2015, the Claimant informed ICSID that the parties were unable to reach an agreement concerning the method for the Tribunal's constitution. Therefore, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal be constituted in accordance with the formula set forth in Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.\n\n22.\n\nOn 4 January 2016, the Claimant appointed Prof. Kaj Hob\u00e9r, a national of Sweden as its party-appointed arbitrator. Prof. Hob\u00e9r accepted his appointment on 11 January 2016.\n\n23.\n\nOn 18 January 2016, the Respondent appointed Prof. J\u00fcrgen Kurtz, a dual national of Australia and Germany as its party-appointed arbitrator. Prof. Kurtz accepted his appointment on 19 January 2016.\n\n24.\n\nOn 14 June 2016, the Claimant informed ICSID that the parties had reached an agreement regarding the appointment of the presiding arbitrator in compliance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. Pursuant to this agreement, Prof. Hob\u00e9r and Prof. Kurtz would make their best efforts to reach an agreement on the appointment of the presiding arbitrator.\n\n25.\n\nOn 25 June 2016, ICSID was informed about the co-arbitrators' agreement to appoint Judge James R. Crawford, a national of Australia as the presiding arbitrator.\n\n26.\n\nOn 11 July 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the **Arbitration Rules**), notified the parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mrs. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**C. First Session, the Admissibility of New Evidence, and the Written Phase**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nOn 6 September 2016, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the parties by teleconference.\n\n28.\n\nFollowing the first session, on 21 September 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 recording the agreement of the parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 provides, *inter alia*, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out a schedule for the jurisdictional/merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n29.\n\nOn 15 December 2016, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to decide on the admissibility of new evidence into the record, and to grant an extension to file its Memorial on the Merits.\n\n30.\n\nOn 20 December 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit its comments concerning the Cl. Request, and granted the extension for the submission of the Claimant's Memorial on the Merits to 3 January 2017.\n\n31.\n\nOn 3 January 2017, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits accompanied by the witness statements of: Mr. Guillermo Osvaldo Diaz, Mr. Martin Lommatzsch, Mr. Gabriel Omar Hernandez, and the damages expert report of Compass Lexecon.\n\n32.\n\nOn 6 January 2017, the Respondent filed further comments on the Cl. Request.\n\n33.\n\nOn 10 January 2017, the Tribunal rejected the Cl. Request and invited the parties to submit any evidence in their further pleadings.\n\n34.\n\nOn 25 April 2017, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction. Pursuant to Section 14.9 of Procedural Order No. 1, this proceeding was bifurcated; thus, the objections to jurisdiction were to be decided as a preliminary matter and the proceeding on the merits was suspended.\n\n35.\n\nOn 5 June 2017, the Claimant proposed to the Tribunal the amendment of the procedural calendar. On June 7 2017, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit its comments by 13 June 2017.\n\n36.\n\nOn 13 June 2017, the Respondent rejected the Claimant's proposal of 5 June 2017. By letter of the same date, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to accept its proposal and to set a hearing date for November 2017.\n\n37.\n\nOn 14 June 2017, the Respondent requested the Claimant to confirm its schedule of submissions and asked the Tribunal to maintain the procedural calendar set forth in Procedural Order No. 1.\n\n38.\n\nOn 16 June 2017, the Tribunal invited the parties to liaise and submit an agreed revised procedural calendar for the Tribunal's consideration by 21 June 2017.\n\n39.\n\nOn 21 June 2017, the parties requested the Tribunal for an extension to submit the revised procedural calendar. As approved by the Tribunal, the parties submitted a revised procedural calendar on 23 June 2017.\n\n40.\n\nOn 24 June 2017, the Tribunal agreed to the parties' revised procedural calendar.\n\n41.\n\nPursuant to the parties' revised procedural calendar of 23 June 2017, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on 17 July 2017, accompanied by the second witness statement of Mr. Guillermo Osvaldo Diaz.\n\n42.\n\nOn 15 September 2017, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction.\n\n43.\n\nOn 31 October 2017, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.\n\n**D. Hearing on Jurisdiction**\n------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nA hearing on Jurisdiction was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. from 28 November to 29 November 2017 (the **Hearing**).

SUMMARY OF ARGENTINA'S OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION AND SALINI IMPREGILO'S SUBMISSIONS**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n45.\n\nArgentina seeks a declaration that the dispute falls outside the jurisdiction of the ICSID and the competence of the Tribunal. Alternatively, it seeks a declaration that the *forum non conveniens* doctrine applies such that the proper venue in which to hear the dispute is an Argentine court. Argentina further seeks costs.28\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [153].\n\n46.\n\nArgentina presents four objections to jurisdiction:\n\n(1) Extinctive prescription operates so that Salini Impregilo's claim is time-barred.\n\n(2) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because Salini Impregilo has not satisfied the jurisdictional pre-conditions in relation to domestic Argentine proceedings (Article 8 of the BIT):\n\n(i) The dispute was not submitted to local administrative process or to the local courts for eighteen months (Article 8(2) and 8(3) of the BIT). There were local proceedings but they involved a different dispute, with different parties, seeking a different remedy.\n\n(ii) Alternatively, if domestic proceedings were brought such that Articles 8(2) and 8(3) were satisfied, Salini Impregilo did not abandon the domestic proceedings as required by Article 8(4) of the BIT.\n\n(iii) Salini Impregilo responds that (if it did not comply with Article 8 in any respect), the BIT's MFN provision (Article 3) applies and therefore Salini Impregilo can avoid the jurisdictional preconditions in Article 8(2) and 8(3). In this respect, it relies on the earlier decision in *Impregilo v Argentina*, which upheld the operation of the MFN clause in this respect, thereby creating a *res judicata*.29\n\n(3) Alternatively, if the Tribunal finds that it has jurisdiction, Argentina argues that its courts are the proper venue to hear the dispute and that the Tribunal should decline to exercise jurisdiction (in application of the *forum non conveniens* principle).\n\n(4) Argentina (in its Reply) objects to Salini Impregilo's standing because the claim belongs to Puentes. Argentina does not identify this argument as a separate objection but raises it as part of its *forum non conveniens* argument.30\n\n*Impregilo v Argentine Republic* (*Impregilo S.p.A. v Argentina*), ICSID Case No ARB/07/17, Award, 21 June 2011.\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [146].\n\n47.\n\nSalini Impregilo requests that the Tribunal reject all of Argentina's jurisdictional objections and proceed to decide the merits of its claims.31\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [6].\n\n**A. Applicable Law**\n---------------------\n\n48.\n\nThe applicable law under the BIT is set out in Article 8(7) of the BIT:\n\nThe arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute \u2013 including its rules on conflict of laws \u2013, the provisions of this Agreement, the terms of any possible specific agreement concluded in relation to the investment as well as with the applicable principles of international law.\n\n49.\n\nTherefore, the applicable laws are the laws of Argentina, the provisions of the BIT, the Concession Contract and the applicable principles of international law. Article 8(7) does not however determine the relationship between these different sources.\n\n50.\n\nThe interpretation of the BIT is to be carried out according to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (**VCLT**).32 Both states were already parties to the VCLT when the BIT was concluded (Argentina ratified the VCLT in 1972 and Italy ratified it in 1974); it is thus applicable in accordance with its Article 4.\n\nArgentina and Salini Impregilo acknowledge this. See also *Hochtief AG v Argentine Republic (Hochtief v Argentina)*, ICSID Case No ARB/07/31, Decision on Jurisdiction, Washington, 24 October 2011, para [26].\n\n**B. The First Preliminary Objection: Extinctive Prescription**\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) Argentina's submissions**\n-------------------------------\n\n51.\n\nArgentina argues that Salini Impregilo initiated the arbitration proceedings after an unreasonable delay33 and therefore Salini Impregilo's claim, based on measures adopted more than a decade ago, is time-barred.34 Argentina initially sought to rely on 'liberative prescription' in its Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, which it says applies to some of the measures on which Salini Impregilo's claim is based.35 Liberative prescription is put forward as a principle of Argentine law and also as a general principle of law, both of which are applicable pursuant to Article 8(7) of the BIT.36 Liberative prescription is said to be widely recognised by international courts and tribunals as a principle of international law.37 According to Argentina there are two elements for liberative prescription to apply: failure by the holder of a right to exercise that right and the passage of time.38\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [1].\n\nIbid, para [21]; Argentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [75].\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [31].\n\nIbid, para [4]: Argentina identifies liberative prescription through the 'comparative method' (most jurisdictions recognise the principle: paras [37]-[42]) and the 'essentialist method' (the principle is fundamental in order for any legal system to exist: paras [43]-[46]).\n\nIbid, para [47].\n\nIbid, para [35].\n\n52.\n\nIn its Reply, Argentina adopts Salini Impregilo's terminology of 'extinctive prescription' which Argentina appears to equate to the principle of 'liberative prescription'.39 In relation to extinctive prescription, Argentina states that its elements include:\n\ni. unreasonable delay,\n\nii. attributable to the claimant.40\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [5].\n\nIbid, paras [7], [12].\n\n53.\n\nUnlike Salini Impregilo, Argentina does not recognise two further elements of extinctive prescription, namely:\n\niii. inadequate record of the facts; and\n\niv. prejudice (i.e. severe disadvantage) to the respondent.41\n\nIbid, paras [8], [13].\n\n54.\n\nIn Argentina's view a lack of evidence that places the respondent at a severe disadvantage is a potential consequence of a situation where prescription takes place, not a requirement for prescription to apply.42 Argentina argues that it has suffered prejudice in establishing its defence:43 The authorities involved in the measures challenged by Salini Impregilo are no longer in office and they cannot be expected accurately to recall events that happened long ago. Further, the long period of time elapsed makes it very difficult to check factual allegations.44\n\nIbid, para [13].\n\nIbid, para [15].\n\nIbid, para [15].\n\n55.\n\nArgentina notes that domestic law is a source of law under Article 8(7) of the BIT. It follows from Article 8(7) that domestic law rules may be applied in determining whether the delay in bringing a claim is unreasonable. It maintains that extinctive prescription is a matter of substantive law and that, even if domestic law is only a source of law in relation to substantive issues in the arbitration, domestic law applies to the discussion of extinctive prescription.45\n\nIbid, paras [10]-[11].\n\n56.\n\nApplying its domestic law, Argentina argues that the period of prescription applicable to Salini Impregilo's claim is two years from the time when Salini Impregilo became aware of the measures that allegedly violated the BIT. This is because an arbitral claim where a violation of a BIT is invoked falls within the category of a tort claim and the Argentine Civil Code provides for a period of limitation of two years in tort claims.46\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [54]. At the time the arbitration was commenced on 1 September 2015, the time limit for contract claims seems to have been 5 years: Civil and Commercial Code, Art 2560 (in force 1 August 2015). Previously it was 10 years.\n\n57.\n\nFrom a comparative analysis of domestic time limitations, Argentina observes that 'the temporal limit on actions [for] tort claims' is generally 'short', between two and six years.47 From a comparative analysis of treaties, Argentina concludes that there is a 'tendency' for BITs to include short periods of prescription.48\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [41].\n\nIbid, para [56]. One example given is three years, 6 months in the Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership Agreement.\n\n58.\n\nArgentina points out that by September 2015, when Salini Impregilo filed its Request for Arbitration, thirteen years had passed since the 2002 emergency legislation and twelve years since Resolution No 14/2003 of 30 June 2003.49 Almost ten years had passed since the first renegotiation agreement (the first MOU between Argentina and Puentes) was entered into in 2006.50 Eight years had passed since Hochtief (a German shareholder in Puentes) brought its ICSID claim.51 Argentina concludes that the arbitral claim, based on the 2002 emergency legislation, the failure to renegotiate the economic equilibrium of the contract and resolution No 14/2003, is time-barred.52\n\nIbid, para [1]; Argentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [23].\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [2].\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [26].\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [75].\n\n59.\n\nArgentina concedes that Salini Impregilo provided notice in 2007 of its treaty claim.53 However, it argues that Salini Impregilo did not display any intention to continue with its claim between 2007 and 2015.54 Argentina maintains that Salini Impregilo's delay involves an abuse of process because Salini Impregilo delayed the filing of its Request for Arbitration for merely speculative purposes.55\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [41]: 'after its 2007 notice, Salini Impregilo did not display any intention to continue with its claim'.\n\nIbid, para [41].\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [43].\n\n60.\n\nArgentina maintains that Salini Impregilo is a regular user of the investment arbitration system and was well aware of the need to file requests for arbitration within a reasonable period after expiration of the term for amicable negotiations. If Salini Impregilo wanted to preserve its claim after 2007, the diligent course of action would have been to file a request for arbitration and subsequently stay the proceedings.56\n\nIbid, para [42].\n\n61.\n\nArgentina notes that Salini Impregilo brought a claim based on the 2002 emergency measures in relation to another of its concessions.57 It concludes from this that Salini Impregilo cannot be allowed now to abuse the right to bring a claim based on measures which were adopted over a decade ago.58\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [74]; *Impregilo v Argentina*. That claim was in relation to Aguas del Gran Buenos Aires, a water and sewerage company.\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras [4], [74].\n\n62.\n\nArgentina rejects Salini Impregilo's argument that the delay was reasonable because Salini Impregilo was participating in the renegotiation process and because Salini Impregilo had to sign waivers of its rights in order for Puentes to enter into interim agreements with Argentina.59 Argentina points to the fact that the waivers were subject to each of the agreements being implemented. Salini Impregilo cannot maintain that it had committed not to initiate arbitration under the agreements (on the condition that they entered into force), and at the same time argue that Argentina never properly executed the agreements.60 Argentina further rejects Salini Impregilo's argument that Argentina is estopped from pursuing an objection to jurisdiction based on prescription.61 Argentina accepts that Decree No 1090/2002 established that investors had to choose from two options: bringing a claim for breach of contract or renegotiating the contract.62 If an investor filed a claim for breach of contract outside the renegotiation process it would be automatically excluded from that process.63 However Argentina stresses that the Decree was limited to claims based upon breaches of contract and did not cover treaty claims. It maintains therefore that the Claimant was never prevented from filing an arbitration proceeding.64\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [27].\n\nIbid, paras [29]-[30].\n\nIbid, para [36]; Salini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [73] for Claimant's argument.\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [32] with reference to Decree No 1090/2002, Art 1.\n\nIbid, para [32], fn 61.\n\nIbid, paras [32], [36].\n\n63.\n\nArgentina further points out that the exchanges that took place within the framework of the negotiations do not rise to an estoppel because the waiver of Salini Impregilo's right to bring an action was subject to the entry into force of the agreements: according to Argentina, a statement made conditionally cannot create a binding estoppel.65 Argentina had not shown its clear intention to be legally bound, and the draft agreements were not binding.66\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [36], citing K Hob\u00e9r, *Essays on International Arbitration*, (New York: JurisNet, LLC, 2006), 220-221.\n\nIbid, paras [39]-[40].\n\n64.\n\nArgentina appears to say that its own conduct is irrelevant to the Tribunal's prescription inquiry. Argentina points out that prescription, and doctrines related to prescription (acquiescence, estoppel, waiver), do not take into account what happens with the other party. Rather, they are doctrines with legal consequences deriving from the conduct of one party, e.g. 'the passage of time and a failure to act that lead[s] to the belief that a given situation is true'.67\n\nIbid, para [19].\n\n**(2) Salini Impregilo's submissions**\n--------------------------------------\n\n65.\n\nSalini Impregilo points out that the BIT does not contain any time limit for bringing proceedings.68 It argues that Article 8(7) of the BIT does not mean that Argentine law applies to jurisdictional issues. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is created by the ICSID Convention (Article 25) and the BIT, which are treaties governed by international law alone.69 There is no basis for applying Argentina's domestic statute of limitations for tort claims to Salini Impregilo's BIT claim.70 For the same reason the choice-of-law provision in the BIT (Article 8(7)) does not cause Argentine law to apply to jurisdictional issues in an ICSID proceeding.71 Further Salini Impregilo argues that there is no basis to apply by analogy other treaty limitation periods to the BIT72 nor to extract a general principle from diverse municipal laws on limitation.73 Finally, to impose the proposed ten-year time limit chosen by Argentina would be arbitrary74 and would unfairly surprise Salini Impregilo and other Italian and Argentine investors.75\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [2].\n\nIbid, para [8]. Salini Impregilo concedes that Argentine law is relevant to the merits of the case: ibid.\n\nIbid, para [14]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [10]. Salini Impregilo relies on Hob\u00e9r's work on extinctive prescription, which is also relied upon by Argentina. See Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [11], footnote 15.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [13].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [15].\n\nIbid, para [58].\n\nIbid, para [59].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [11].\n\n66.\n\nSalini Impregilo argues that whether prescription is substantive (as Argentina maintains) or procedural is irrelevant. Prescription is a jurisdictional defence and the Tribunal's jurisdiction is governed by international law only. Argentina's characterisation of prescription as substantive \u2013 in order to argue for the application of domestic law \u2013 is to no avail.76\n\nIbid, para [14].\n\n67.\n\nSalini Impregilo argues that no authority has recognised a general principle of limitation.77 Rather, it seeks to distinguish prescription as a matter of substance, which aims at justice in every case, and limitation, which pertains to process and varies in different jurisdictions.78 Prescription would only apply to the BIT claim if it were interpreted as a relevant rule of international law that is not displaced by any *lex specialis*. Salini Impregilo concedes that the BIT is not governed by any *lex specialis* that would displace the doctrine of extinctive prescription.79\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [60].\n\nIbid, citing *John H. Williams v Venezuela* (1885) 29 RIAA 279, 286-288.\n\nIbid, para [14].\n\n68.\n\nSalini Impregilo rejects Argentina's articulation of the two elements of prescription.80 It argues that under customary international law, to the extent that extinctive prescription exists, four cumulative81 elements must be proven:\n\ni. Unreasonable delay : There is no fixed time limit under international law.82 The assessment of reasonableness will take account of the circumstances of the case. One way to assess reasonableness is whether the delay is so long that it creates the disadvantage that it would be difficult for the respondent to develop evidence for its defence.83 Salini Impregilo argues that it took part in the renegotiation process from 2002 to 2013 in support of Puentes and therefore its delay was reasonable.84\n\nii. The delay must be due to the claimant's negligence :85 Salini Impregilo says it was not negligent in presenting its claim because it participated in the Argentine renegotiation process.86 Further, it argues that Argentina points to no evidence of Salini Impregilo's negligence other than the 13-year delay in the initiation of the arbitration.87\n\niii. Lack of evidentiary record : Salini Impregilo says that under international law, if the factual record is well-established or undisputed, prescription may not be invoked even if long periods of time pass between the measures at issue and the bringing of the claim.88 Salini Impregilo says that a well-established record exists in this case.89 Argentina has extensive evidence relevant to its defence due to the domestic renegotiation process, the *Hochtief v. Argentina* arbitration90 and the domestic court actions between Puentes and Argentina (Puentes' bankruptcy proceeding and Puentes' claim before the Argentine judiciary).91 Further Argentina was notified of Salini Impregilo's BIT claim in 2007.92\n\niv. Respondent would be prejudiced (placed at a severe disadvantage)93 in putting forth a defence due to the claimant's negligent delay.94 Salini Impregilo says that Argentina cannot invoke extinctive prescription because it cannot articulate any prejudice it would suffer in establishing its defence.95 When Argentina raised difficulties verifying factual circumstances and the fact that authorities directly involved were no longer in office, Salini Impregilo responded that these cannot be deemed prejudicial.96\n\nIbid, para [57].\n\nIbid, para [35].\n\nIbid, para [20].\n\nIbid, para [23].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [28].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [27].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [7].\n\nIbid, para [26].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [49]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [37], relying on J Wouters & S Verhoeven, 'Prescription', in *Max Planck Encyclopedia of Public International Law* (Oxford University Press, 2008), para [6].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [49].\n\nIbid, para [55]. Hochtief is a German company with a 26% share in Puentes and was a member of the concession consortium. It initiated international arbitration through ICSID and a final award was issued on 21 December 2016.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [2]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [39].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [2].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [33]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [42].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras [2]; [27].\n\nIbid, para [51].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [43].\n\n69.\n\nThus, not a single element of 'a time-bar defense under international law' can be proven by Argentina.97 To identify these four elements of extinctive prescription Salini Impregilo draws on the work of Hob\u00e9r on extinctive prescription (on which Argentina also relies).98 Salini Impregilo says even if the Tribunal accepts Argentina's submission that only the first two elements apply, these cannot be proven.99\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [2].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [16].\n\nIbid, para [48].\n\n70.\n\nAccording to Salini Impregilo, Argentina misrepresents Salini Impregilo's claim by maintaining that Salini Impregilo took 13 years to bring it: Salini Impregilo clarifies that its claim is not that the 2002 Emergency Law violated the BIT, but rather it seeks compensation for Argentina's failure to renegotiate and restore the Concession's economic equilibrium under the post-Emergency Law situation,100 and specifically by its failure to implement the first renegotiation agreement in 2006.101\n\nIbid, para [27].\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction, Transcript, 28 November 2017, 167.\n\n71.\n\nSalini Impregilo states that it notified Argentina of its treaty claims in 2007 in writing102 and therefore prescription does not apply to this arbitration. Notification renders prescription inapplicable.103 Under international law, delay refers to the length of time taken in notifying a respondent of the claim, not the time when the claim is actually pursued.104 This is the case because of the requirement that the delay cause prejudice; once the respondent is notified of a claim it can proceed to collect evidence in relation to the claim for its defence and will not be prejudiced by further delay.105\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [2]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [2]; Exhibit C-0052.\n\nSalini Impegilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras [7], [19].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [24]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [19].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [24].\n\n72.\n\nSalini Impregilo asserts that it did display an intention to continue with its claim between 2007 and 2015.106 In this regard it relies on Puentes' letter of 26 April 2002 reserving its shareholders' treaty claims; the 2007 notification letter from Salini Impregilo to Argentina; the meeting between Salini Impregilo and Argentina in October 2007; the exchanges of communication between Salini Impregilo and Argentina in 2008 and the requests by Argentine officials that Salini Impregilo not pursue international arbitration.107\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [18].\n\nIbid, para [20].\n\n73.\n\nFrom 2006 to shortly before the initiation of the arbitration claim, Salini Impregilo was participating in and supporting Puentes' efforts to resolve the issues underlying the treaty claims via Argentina's domestic renegotiation process.108 According to Salini Impregilo, participation in negotiations will effectively 'toll the time period related to extinctive prescription. '109 Further, on 26 April 2002, Puentes notified Argentina that its participation in the renegotiation process could not be taken as its shareholders' waiver of their right to commence damage claims for Argentina's breach of the Concession Contract and violation of international treaties. Therefore, Argentina was made aware from 2002 that Salini Impregilo 'may file' an international arbitration claim110 and Argentina knew that Salini Impregilo's participation in the renegotiation process was not an abdication of its BIT claims.111 Salini Impregilo rejects Argentina's arguments that Salini Impregilo delayed requesting an arbitration for speculative purposes and therefore Salini Impregilo committed an abuse of process.112\n\nIbid, paras [2], [36]; Salini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [2].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [25]. Salini Impregilo quotes *Certain Phosphate Lands in Nauru (Nauru v Australia), Preliminary Objections, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1992**,* in support of this proposition; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [7].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [36]; Exhibit C-0024 (Impregilo \u2013 now Salini Impregilo \u2013 is listed under Puentes' logo on the letterhead).\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [20].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [56].\n\n74.\n\nSalini Impregilo argues that any delay attributable to the Respondent's conduct cannot constitute the basis for extinctive prescription.113 Here, Argentina's domestic legislation excluded a company from the renegotiation process if its shareholders initiated treaty claims.114\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [28]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras [46]-[47].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras [2], [38]; Argentina's Decree 1090/2002 mandated that all breach of contract claims against the government be resolved through the renegotiation process. According to Salini Impregilo the Decree excluded from the renegotiation process any company that brought a claim outside that process, thereby constraining parties seeking to pursue a legal remedy in relation to the emergency legislation.\n\n75.\n\nFurther, Argentina repeatedly asked Salini Impregilo to refrain from initiating investment arbitration in deference to the domestic renegotiation process.115 Accordingly, Salini Impregilo argues that: in direct recognition of Argentina's request that Salini Impregilo not initiate arbitration, Salini Impregilo did not proceed with its treaty claims, all the while hoping that Argentina would resolve the dispute\u2026through (and as required by) its own renegotiation process.116\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras [2], [39], [52]; Exhibit CWS-0004.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [40].\n\n76.\n\nSalini Impregilo further points to the six renegotiation agreements signed by Argentina and Puentes, for each of which Salini Impregilo provided a written waiver of its rights to pursue its treaty claims if those agreements entered into effect.117 Salini Impregilo says that Argentina's demand for these waivers of BIT claims belies Argentina's claims that Salini Impregilo did not display its intention to continue with the BIT claims.118 Only after it became clear that Argentina had no intention to implement the agreements, did Puentes file an administrative complaint, one which expressly stated that Salini Impregilo was one of its shareholders.119 Salini Impregilo says it initiated this arbitration shortly after Argentina expropriated its investment by terminating Puentes' Concession Contract.120\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras [40], [43]; the 6 agreements are two MOU in 2006 and 2007 and four transitory agreements in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [21].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [44].\n\nIbid, para [45]. Argentina terminated Puentes' contract on 29 August 2014 and Salini Impregilo filed its Request for Arbitration on 1 September 2015.\n\n77.\n\nIn relation to Argentina's argument that Salini Impregilo should have initiated the current arbitration given that it had initiated arbitration in relation to another investment, Salini Impregilo differentiates that case by saying that Argentina terminated the other concession contract in 2006 and did not execute a series of interim agreements as it did with Puentes.121 Further, in response to Argentina's suggestion that Salini Impregilo should have requested an arbitration and then stayed the proceedings, Salini Impregilo responds that this would have been wasteful. At all times until the initiation of this arbitration Salini Impregilo had hoped that the dispute could be amicably resolved.122\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [46].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [22].\n\n78.\n\nFinally, Salini Impregilo argues that Argentina is estopped from asserting an objection to jurisdiction based on prescription because by words and conduct it represented that the dispute would be resolved via renegotiation.123 Argentina caused the delay and should not be allowed to rely on that delay to object to jurisdiction.124 In particular it should not be able to benefit from its own wrongdoing in failing to execute any of the six interim agreements with Puentes125 and Salini Impregilo cannot be faulted for believing Argentina's promises that the dispute would be solved amicably.126 Salini Impregilo counters Argentina's argument that the agreements were not enforceable by saying that they remained agreements and not mere negotiations.127\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [73]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [49].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [55].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [75].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [28].\n\nIbid, paras [49]-[52]\n\n79.\n\nIn Salini Impregilo's view Argentina caused the purported delay in the filing of this arbitration by failing to implement the six agreements and other measures.128 Argentina passed Decree 1090/2002, whereby companies were required to choose between the renegotiation process or raising BIT claims.129 The legislation 'had a chilling effect on investors' and convinced them that participating in renegotiation was the better option.130 Argentina was critical of Salini Impregilo's partner, Hochtief, for initiating investment arbitration rather than participating in the renegotiation process131 and made public statement against investors who filed BIT arbitrations.132 Further, Argentine authorities publicly promoted an 'antagonistic environment' against foreign investors who were encouraged to drop claims brought before ICSID.133\n\nIbid, para [29].\n\nIbid, paras [31]-[32]. Salini Impregilo refers to the case of *BG v Argentine Republic*, Final Award, 24 December 2007, in which the court found that the Decree would have the effect of excluding from the renegotiation process any concessionaire that filed an investment arbitration, para [136]. See also Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [50].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [30].\n\nIbid, para [23]; Exhibit C-0392, para [161].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [29].\n\nIbid, para [33].\n\n80.\n\nArgentina signalled to Salini Impregilo that filing for arbitration would jeopardise reaching an amicable solution134 and repeatedly asked Salini Impregilo not to initiate investment arbitration.135 According to Salini Impregilo, following Hochtief's filing for arbitration, UNIREN demanded that Puentes and its shareholders undertake not to file any complaints relating to the Emergency Law against the Government and sign an indemnity agreement in favour of the Government against complaints filed by its shareholders.136 When Argentina terminated the Concession Contract it blamed Hochtief's decision to file an ICSID claim.137\n\nIbid, para [29].\n\nIbid, para [50].\n\nIbid, para [34].\n\nIbid, para [51].\n\n81.\n\nFinally, Argentina 'dragged out' the renegotiation process for 12 years138 and signed six agreements with Puentes that required the suspension and eventual withdrawal of treaty claims.139 Salini Impregilo trusted Argentina throughout the 12-year negotiation process with the aim of an amicable resolution.140\n\nIbid, para [7].\n\nIbid, para [50].\n\nIbid, para [36].\n\n**(3) The Tribunal's conclusions**\n----------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nArgentina's first if not principal argument was that this is a matter governed by Argentine law under the applicable law clause, Article 8(7) of the BIT.141 But Article 8(7) refers to both Argentine law and international law; it does not change their respective scope of operation. Salini Impregilo is not claiming in respect of an Argentine tort or contract but for breach of the autonomous standards of the BIT in respect of Argentina's failure to restore the economic balance of the concession following pesification.142 That claim is at least plausible, as the *Hochtief v. Argentina* award shows. There is no basis in Article 8(7) of the BIT to apply Argentine time limits or the Argentine law of prescription, either directly or by analogy, to Salini Impregilo's international law claims.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction, Transcript, 28 November 2017, 71-72; 29 November 2017, 263-264.\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction, Transcript, 28 November 2017, 124-125.\n\n83.\n\nTurning to international law, the Tribunal would first point out that there is a difference between limitation of actions due to lapse of time and extinctive prescription.\n\n84.\n\nAs to limitation of actions, international law lays down no general time limit. A 2012 OECD survey of investment treaties found that only a small proportion (7%) of surveyed treaties barred international arbitration if the claim was not brought within a certain time period.143 NAFTA was one of the first to include such a provision: Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) require a NAFTA claim to be commenced within 3 years of the date on which the claimant acquired, or should have acquired, knowledge of the breach and consequent damage. Some more recent BITs also include time limits. For example, the 2012 Canada-Czech Republic BIT applied a 3-year time limit to investors bringing BIT claims against a host state.144 This particular BIT is silent about time-limits for bringing a claim. So is the ICSID Convention. No fixed limitation period therefore applies in the present case.\n\nOECD, *Dispute settlement provisions in international investment agreements: A large sample survey* (2012, Paris), 18. 1660 bilateral agreements and 'selected' multilateral agreements were compared: ibid, 9.\n\nAgreement between Canada and the Czech Republic for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 6 May 2009, entered into force 22 January 2012, Art X(5)(c)(i).\n\n85.\n\nTurning to extinctive prescription as a matter of international law, this is not mentioned as a separate ground for loss of the right to invoke responsibility in the International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts.145 The ILC rejected the idea that lapse of time alone might entail the loss of a claim.146 Rather, Article 45(b) specifies that the responsibility of a state may not be invoked if the injured state has validly waived the claim or is to be considered as having, by reason of its conduct, validly acquiesced in the lapse of the claim.\n\nInternational Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (2001/II) *Yearbook of the International Law Commission* 26. Cf C Tams, 'Waiver, Acquiescence, and Extinctive Prescription' *,* in J Crawford, A Pellet & S Olleson (eds) *The Law of International Responsibility* (Oxford, 2010) 10351036.\n\nIbid, 1046.\n\n86.\n\nThe matter was expressed in the following terms by the International Court in *Nauru v Australia* :\n\nThe Court recognizes that, even in the absence of any applicable treaty provision, delay on the part of a claimant State may render an application inadmissible. It notes, however, that international law does not lay down any specific time-limit in that regard. It is therefore for the Court to determine in the light of the circumstances of each case whether the passage of time renders an application inadmissible.147\n\n*Nauru v Australia*, Preliminary Objections, Judgment, ICJ Reports 1992, 240, 253-254 (para [32]).\n\n87.\n\nBoth ILC Article 45(b) and the *Nauru v Australia* dictum refer to interstate claims, but in the Tribunal's view similar principles apply to individual claims under international law, e.g. claims for expropriation or for breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under a BIT.\n\n88.\n\nThe position has been summarised in the following terms:\n\n[A] case will not be held inadmissible on grounds of delay unless the respondent state has been clearly disadvantaged and tribunals have engaged in a flexible weighing of relevant circumstances, including, for example, the conduct of the respondent state and the importance of the right involved.\n\nThe decisive factor is not the length of elapsed time in itself, but whether the respondent has suffered prejudice because it could reasonably have expected that the claim would no longer be pursued.148\n\nJ Crawford, *State Responsibility: The General Part* (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 2013) 563.\n\n89.\n\nTo conclude, extinctive prescription is recognised as a principle that can affect the right to bring proceedings under international law,149 although it involves an issue of admissibility rather than jurisdiction. It is for the Tribunal to determine whether the passage of time in this case is such as to render Salini Impregilo's claim inadmissible, having regard to all the circumstances.\n\n*Ambatielos Claim (Greece v United Kingdom)*, (1956) 7 RIAA 83, 103.\n\n90.\n\nThe parties agree that, for extinctive prescription to operate, the delay must be unreasonable and be attributable to the claimant.150 They do not agree on whether prejudice to the respondent is an element of prescription. But it appears from the sources cited above that prejudice to the respondent, in the sense of creating difficulties in answering the claimant's claim, is an element of prescription.151 On this basis Salini Impregilo's notification of its treaty claims in 2007 is relevant because Argentina was on notice at least by that date that there might be a treaty claim forthcoming.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras [2], [19] Argentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [7].\n\n*Nauru v Australia*, 255. See also Tams, 1047; J Crawford, *Brownlie's Principles of Public International Law* (Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2012), 700.\n\n91.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, having regard to all the circumstances, the delay here was not unreasonable, did not entail any acquiescence by Salini Impregilo in the lapse of its claim and did not trigger the principle of extinctive prescription. Salini Impregilo's explanations for the delay include:\n\ni. Its participation in the renegotiation process. Some negotiations took place directly between Salini Impregilo and the Argentine government in 2007 and 2008,152 quite apart from Puentes' repeated attempts to renegotiate.\n\nii. Argentina's legislation which on the face of it excludes a company from the renegotiation process if its shareholders have initiated treaty claims.153\n\niii. Salini Impregilo alleges that Argentine officials repeatedly asked it to participate in the renegotiation process and not to initiate international arbitration.154 In this regard Salini Impregilo notes that the testimony of Mr. Guillermo Diaz remains unchallenged and that Argentina has not sought to submit testimony from the former leader of UNIREN in relation to the failed renegotiation process.155\n\niv. Salini Impregilo was obliged to waive its rights to litigate so that the six interim agreements could be signed by Puentes as part of the renegotiation process: none of these agreements entered into force.\n\nv. Puentes' domestic actions in 2013 and 2014.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [51]; Exhibits C-0053 and C-0055 (letters from Salini Impregilo to representatives of Argentina), Exhibit C-0054 (letter from Argentina to Salini Impregilo).\n\nCWS-0004, Second witness statement of Guillermo O.

The Argentine witness Salini Impregilo mentioned is Mr. Simeonoff, the former leader of UNIREN. Mr. Simeonoff is mentioned in Mr. Diaz' statement as follows: 'Mr. Simeonoff also stated that filing any legal claim in connection with the issue of the Emergency Law or the renegotiation process, including an arbitration under the BIT, would mean the negotiation would automatically come to an end': CWD-0004, Second witness statement of Guillermo O. Diaz, 17 July 2017, para [13].\n\n92.\n\nIn addition, there is a very substantial documentary record as a result of the *Hochtief v Argentina* arbitration and the domestic proceedings.\n\n93.\n\nThe fact that Salini Impregilo initiated arbitration in relation to another concession156 in July 2007 is not persuasive in relation to Argentina's argument as to delay.157 That case also involved a claim relating to Argentina's emergency legislation of 2002. However, it involved termination of a concession contract by Argentina in July 2006 (eight years before Argentina terminated the Concession Contract in this case). The facts appear to be very different from the present case, where Salini Impregilo alleges extensive participation in the renegotiation program by Puentes and some participation of its own.\n\n*Impregilo v Argentina*.\n\nSee Argentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [3].\n\n94.\n\nFor these reasons, Argentina's objection based on delay in bringing the claim fails.\n\n**C. Second Preliminary Objection: Article 8: Submission of Controversy to Domestic Jurisdiction for 18 Months**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n95.\n\nArticle 8 of the BIT provides:\n\n1. Any dispute regarding an investment between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Party, regarding the issues regulated by this Agreement, shall, as far as possible, be settled through amicable consultations between the parties to the dispute.\n\n2. If such consultations do not result in a solution, the dispute may be submitted to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Party in whose territory the investment is made.\n\n3. Where, after eighteen months from the date of notice of commencement of proceedings before the national jurisdictions mentioned in paragraph 2 above, the dispute between an investor and one of the Contracting Parties has not been resolved, it may be referred to international arbitration.\n\nFor such purposes, and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, each Contracting Party hereby irrevocably consents in advance to submit any dispute to arbitration.\n\n4. From the time arbitration proceedings are commenced, each party to the dispute shall take any such measures as may be necessary to dismiss any pending court proceedings.\n\n96.\n\nPuentes made an administrative complaint on 11 June 2013 by letter pursuant to the Administrative Procedure Law No. 19549.158 The administrative complaint sought a declaration of termination of the Concession Contract due to Argentina's exclusive fault.159\n\nExhibit C-0049 is the letter seeking to commence that action; Salini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [44]; Salini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [45].\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras [27], [110]; Salini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [53].\n\n97.\n\nPuentes also filed an action with the Argentine court on 30 May 2014.160 The court summonsed Salini Impregilo as a third party to Puentes' court action on 25 October 2016.161\n\nArgentina appears to accept these events occurred: see Argentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras [27], [105], [145].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [107]; Argentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [148]; Exhibit C-0060.\n\n98.\n\nArgentina argues that the following requirements 'set forth in Article 8' are part of the essential terms under which Argentina consented to submit disputes to international arbitration and form a 'sequential, multiple-stage dispute settlement mechanism'162 comprising:\n\ni. amicable consultations;\n\nii. if such consultations do not provide a solution, the dispute is to be submitted to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the host state;\n\niii. 18 months must elapse from the initiation of proceedings before the local courts; and\n\niv. any domestic court proceedings that may have been initiated must be abandoned once the international arbitration is initiated.163\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [76]; Argentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [64].\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [93].\n\n99.\n\nIn the first place, it appears that the amicable consultations contemplated by Article 8(1) of the BIT have taken place. Salini Impregilo accepts that undertaking amicable consultation for six months is a requirement.164 It points to its letter of 12 October 2007 which notifies Argentina of the existence of a dispute under the BIT, to the meeting between Argentina's Office of the Attorney-General and Salini Impregilo on 22 October 2007 and to correspondence in 2008 between Salini Impregilo and Argentina.165 It further points to Puentes' pursuit of an amicable resolution over the twelve years prior to the arbitration proceedings.166\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [50].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, paras [51]-[52]. See letters from Salini Impregilo to Argentina, October 2007 (Exhibit C-0052), March 2008 (Exhibit C-0053) and May 2008 (Exhibit C-0055) and letter from Argentina to Salini Impregilo in April 2008 (Exhibit C-0054).\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [53].\n\n100.\n\nArgentina does not appear to allege a failure to comply with Article 8(1).167 However, Argentina asserts non-compliance with the provisions concerning pendency of the dispute before the Argentine courts for 18 months168 or, in the alternative, non-compliance with the requirement that any domestic court proceedings be abandoned before international arbitration proceedings take place.169\n\nIn *Hochtief v Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction, Washington, 24 October 2011, the tribunal noted that the parties did not allege failure to comply with a similar obligation contained in the Argentina-Germany BIT and assumed compliance with that obligation, para [29].\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [6].\n\nIbid, para [113].\n\n101.\n\nThus, as to Article 8(2)-(4), two issues arise: (a) was the dispute referred to arbitration more than 18 months after submission to the local processes referred to in Article 8(2); and (b) did Salini Impregilo comply with the withdrawal requirement in Article 8(4)? For reasons that will appear, it is necessary to analyse the two issues separately. Further questions may arise as to the operation of the MFN clause in the BIT, and the *res judicata* effect of the award in *Impregilo S.p.A. v Argentina*.\n\n**(a) Compliance with the 18-month provision (Article 8(2) & (3))**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) Argentina's submissions***\n---------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the word 'dispute' in Article 8 should be given its ordinary meaning in its context, in accordance with the VCLT.170 The 'dispute' submitted to the domestic jurisdiction is the 'dispute regarding an investment between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Party, regarding the issues regulated by this Agreement'.171 But Salini Impregilo failed to submit that dispute to the competent administrative or judicial authorities in Argentina for 18 months as required by Article 8(2) and 8(3) of the BIT.172 Consent to arbitration required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention must be express.173 In particular Argentina argues that Salini Impregilo's interpretation of a dispute in a 'broad, subject matter' sense modifies the will expressed by the States Parties in the BIT.174\n\nVCLT, Art 31. Argentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [71].\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [74], using the terms of Article 8(1) of the BIT.\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras [5]-[6], [77].\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [58].\n\nIbid, para [67].\n\n103.\n\nArgentina says that neither the administrative complaint brought by Puentes on 11 June 2013 nor the court action it filed on 30 May 2014 involved the claim which subsequently led to the BIT arbitration.175 According to Argentina those local proceedings involved a different subject matter, different parties and a different remedy:\n\ni. In relation to the parties, Argentina stresses that Puentes filed the actions in Argentina, not Salini Impregilo; Salini Impregilo cannot rely on Puentes' claim in an Argentine court to show compliance with the requirements of the BIT.176\n\nii. In relation to the dispute, Article 8 states that the dispute submitted to the arbitral body must be the same as the one submitted to the local courts.177 The local claim must have the same subject matter as the claim underlying the arbitration, meaning that it must be based on the same legal grounds. This is because the purpose is to allow the host state to resolve the dispute internally before having access to the international jurisdiction.178 It points to the wording of Article 8 and its reference to a single 'dispute' in each sub-paragraph.179 Argentina says that Puentes' actions (the administrative complaint and the court action) necessarily involved a different subject matter to the treaty claims as the local proceedings were not based on the BIT180 nor did they make any reference to any provision of the BIT or to the breach of international obligations.181\n\niii. In relation to remedies, Argentina says that Salini Impregilo is seeking different remedies through international arbitration than Puentes in the local proceedings. In the local proceedings, Puentes seeks a declaration of termination of the Concession Contract through sole fault of the 'Grantor' (Argentina) on the basis of alleged breaches by it. By contrast Salini Impregilo seeks compensation for Argentina's failure to renegotiate and restore the Concession's economic equilibrium.182\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras [6], [105].\n\nIbid, paras [108]-[109].\n\nArgentine Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [100].\n\nIbid, para [107].\n\nIbid, para [100].\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [106]; Argentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, paras [76]-[77].\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [111]; Argentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [77].\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [110].\n\n104.\n\nIn response to Salini Impregilo's arguments based on the futility of submitting the claim to an Argentine court, Argentina argues that the submission to a domestic court of the claim could resolve the claim. Argentine law provides for legal actions that make a rapid decision possible. The Claimant could have opted to start an action for protection of constitutional rights *(amparo),* an expedited summary action *(acci\u00f4n sumarisima\\* or a motion for a declaratory judgment of certainty *(acci\u00f4n declarativa de certeza),* or to seek precautionary measures such as an injunction to preserve the status quo (*prohibici\u00f4n de innovar*), among others.183\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [132].\n\n105.\n\nArgentina argues that the BIT foresees that no final decision may be issued within 18 months.184 But even if that might occur, it would not justify disregard of Article 8.185\n\nArgentina-Italy BIT, Art 8(3).\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [125].\n\n***(2) Salini Impregilo's submissions***\n----------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nSalini Impregilo accepts that Article 8 of the BIT requires investors, before submitting a dispute to international arbitration, to submit their claims to the competent court or administrative authority of the State in whose territory the investment is made for 18 months.186 But it argues that any administrative or judicial proceeding brought in the host state involving the same subject matter as the investment dispute under the BIT would satisfy the BIT's procedural requirement.187 In Salini Impregilo's view this requirement has been complied with.188 It argues that Puentes' filing of the 11 June 2013 administrative complaint (without need for reference to the later court action) in itself satisfies the BIT's 18-month requirement because the 'essence of the dispute' was before competent Argentine administrative authorities without it being resolved for at least 18 months.189 In Salini Impregilo's view its claims in the arbitration and Puentes' claim in the administrative complaint deal with precisely the same subject matter.190\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [52]; Salini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [76].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [53].\n\nIbid, para [54].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [88]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [3]\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [101].\n\n107.\n\nSalini Impregilo rejects Argentina's interpretation of Article 8 predicated on a 'triple identity' interpretation of 'dispute'.191 In Salini Impregilo's view the 'dispute' or 'controversy' must be subjected to a 'broad, subject matter' interpretation: the controversy or dispute submitted in the local jurisdiction must have the same general subject matter as the treaty claims192 but need not involve the same parties nor the same legal claims.193 Furthermore, the remedy requested need not be the same.194\n\nIbid, paras [78], [99].\n\nIbid, para [82], citing *Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (ELSI) (USA v Italy)*, ICJ Reports 1989, 15, 46 (para [59]).\n\nIbid, paras [78], [99].\n\nIbid, para [100].\n\n108.\n\nSalini Impregilo notes that tribunals have preferred a 'broad, subject matter' interpretation over a 'triple identity' one.195 It argues that customary international law and the purpose of Article 8 compel the broad, subject matter interpretation of 'dispute'.196\n\nIbid, para [91]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [63].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [66].\n\n109.\n\nSalini Impregilo applies its 'broad, subject matter' interpretation of 'dispute' as follows:\n\ni. Admittedly Salini Impregilo and Puentes are not the same party.197 However in Salini Impregilo's view the parties to a local dispute need not be identical to the parties to the arbitration in order to satisfy the 'local-courts requirement' because the BIT requires that the 'dispute' be submitted to local authorities but does not require the claimant-investor *personally* to seek resolution through local courts.198\n\nii. In relation to the subject matter of the dispute, Salini Impregilo agrees with Argentina that the purpose of the requirement of domestic proceedings is to allow the host state to resolve the dispute before the conduct of the host state is reviewed in an international forum. However, Salini Impregilo argues that the 'broad, subject matter' interpretation of 'dispute' serves that purpose because resolving the injury via a domestic-law claim can 'moot the international claim'.199\n\niii. In relation to the remedy, Salini Impregilo argues that there is no authority for the requirement that the remedy requested at domestic and international level be the same.200 In any case, Argentina mischaracterizes Puentes' administrative complaint because Puentes did seek damages in its domestic administrative complaint, as Salini Impregilo does in its treaty claim.201\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [98].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [53].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [89].\n\nIbid, para [100].\n\nIbid, para [87].\n\n110.\n\nSalini Impregilo argues finally that Article 8(3) in relation to local proceedings should be interpreted in light of the rule of exhaustion of local remedies under customary international law.202 It argues that local remedies do not need to be exhausted where there are no reasonably available remedies to provide effective redress or the local remedies provide no reasonable possibility of such redress.203 The history of Puentes' administrative complaint (which Salini Impregilo says was ignored by Argentina) and Puentes' court action (which was still pending in 2017) demonstrates that local litigation would not resolve this dispute within 18 months.204\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [140]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [63].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [140], quoting ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, Art 15 (Legal Authority CL-0203).\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [148].\n\n111.\n\nSalini Impregilo further argues that Article 8 should be interpreted as 'subject to a futility exception' which applies based on the facts of this case. Salini Impregilo argues that the structure of Article 8 suggests that the purpose of the 18-month rule is to provide the respondent state with an opportunity to actually resolve the dispute within 18 months. Therefore, the Tribunal in applying the futility exception to this 18-month rule should analyse whether there is a realistic possibility of resolving the dispute in domestic courts within 18 months.205\n\nIbid, paras [4], [142]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [90].\n\n112.\n\nSalini Impregilo argues that it would be unfair to deprive it of its right to resort to arbitration based on the 18-month requirement when the opportunity to resort to local courts was only theoretical and/or could not have led to an effective resolution of the dispute within 18 months.206 Salini Impregilo says it would be futile for it to commence an action before an Argentine forum and the best evidence for this is that Puentes' court proceedings have been on foot for much longer than 18 months and are still pending.207 Argentina could also have redressed Salini Impregilo's damages through the administrative complaint Puentes initiated on 11 June 2013, but did not do so.208\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras [90], [105].\n\nIbid, paras [3], [100].\n\nIbid, para [89].\n\n113.\n\nSalini Impregilo notes that in its Reply on Jurisdiction Argentina offers no evidence to support its proposition that there were different mechanisms in the Argentine judicial system available to resolve the dispute effectively within 18 months.209 It maintains that a BIT claim could not be resolved in a period of 18 months210 and that in any case the types of expedited proceedings suggested by Argentina would not be appropriate to resolve this case.211\n\nIbid, paras [91]-[92].\n\nIbid, paras [94], [97].\n\nIbid, para [96].\n\n114.\n\nFurther Salini Impregilo notes that the Argentine courts perform poorly in international rankings of independence and efficiency.212 Finally Salini Impregilo would have to incur excessive and disproportionate costs in filing and prosecuting a case before Argentine domestic courts.213\n\nIbid, para [98].\n\nIbid, paras [101]-[103].\n\n***(3) The Tribunal's analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n115.\n\nArticle 8 regulates the conditions by which arbitration proceedings under the BIT may be initiated by an 'investor' against one of the Contracting Parties. The Tribunal must therefore give careful consideration to the specific terms agreed by the Contracting Parties when extending this offer of arbitration, as mandated by the VCLT. To that end, several preliminary points should be made as to the textual construction and sequencing (and therefore contextual guidance) of the component parts of Article 8:\n\n(1) Paragraph 8(1) refers to a 'dispute regarding an investment between an investor of one of the Contracting Parties and the other Party, regarding the issues regulated by this Agreement'. It explicitly requires consultation 'between the parties to the dispute'. It appears from this language that the consultations should involve the investor and the host state, just as the arbitration will be between those parties. There is no provision in the BIT allowing the investment itself (e.g. the local investment company, here Puentes) to be a party to the arbitration.\n\n(2) In direct contrast, Article 8(2) does not specify who may submit the dispute to the 'competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction of the Party in whose territory the investment is made'. In certain situations, it could be a third party \u2013 e.g. the investment company \u2013 which has standing to bring local proceedings or which will naturally do so.\n\n(3) Indeed, as the *Hochtief v Argentina* Tribunal pointed out,214 Article 8(2) (Article 10(2) of the German-Argentine BIT applicable in that case) does not in terms *require* local proceedings to be brought, it simply provides that they 'may be submitted'.\n\n(4) As also pointed out in *Hochtief v Argentina*,215 it would have been open to Argentina itself to have submitted the proceeding to the local courts. One might also envisage the dispute being submitted by a separate Argentine entity, whether or not an organ of the Argentine state, e.g. a state corporation which is a party to the concession agreement giving rise to the dispute.\n\n(5) Article 8(4) only applies to 'pending court proceedings' and not to the administrative proceedings referred in Article 8(2).\n\n(6) Article 8(4) requires each party to the dispute submitted to arbitration to take 'any such measures as may be necessary to dismiss any pending court proceedings'. This is not stated to be a precondition to submission to arbitration; rather it applies '[f]rom the time arbitration proceedings are commenced'. It could thus be regarded as a matter going to admissibility, not jurisdiction.216\n\n*Hochtief v Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 October 2011, para [36].\n\nIbid, para [37].\n\nAs counsel for Argentina all but conceded in argument: Transcript, Hearing on Jurisdiction, 29 November 2017, pages 307-308: 'if this Tribunal did not consider that to be a jurisdictional requirement, it should at least consider it as an admissibility requirement'.\n\n116.\n\nIndeed, the Tribunal would observe that it could have been open to Salini Impregilo to accept Argentina's narrow interpretation of dispute in Article 8. On that basis it could have relied on the literal terms of Article 8(2) and (3) to argue that since no proceeding as mentioned in Article 8(2) had (on this interpretation) been commenced, neither the 18-month pendency requirement in Article 8(3) nor the withdrawal requirement in Article 8(4) had been triggered. One cannot be required to withdraw a proceeding one has never started.\n\n117.\n\nBut Salini Impregilo did not do this. It expressly accepted that the 18-month limit under Article 8(3) had to be respected, and instead argued (as noted already) for a flexible and broad interpretation of 'dispute' in Article 8.\n\n118.\n\nSalini Impregilo's position is supported by other arbitral awards. In *Maffezini v Spain* the tribunal held that the domestic litigation provision in the Argentina-Spain BIT was a mandatory precondition to arbitration.217 In *Impregilo S.p.A. v Argentina* the tribunal determined that pursuant to Article 8(2) of the Argentina-Italy BIT, an investor was not obliged to bring a dispute before a local court218 but that submission to the domestic jurisdiction for 18 months pursuant to Article 8(3) of the Argentina-Italy BIT was mandatory before an ICSID tribunal could assert jurisdiction.219\n\n*Maffezini v Kingdom of Spain* (*Maffezini v Spain*), ICSID Case No ARB/97/7, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000, para [36].\n\n*Impregilo v Argentina,* Award, 21 June 2011, para [83].\n\nIbid, para [94]. See Separate and Dissenting Opinion of J. Christopher Thomas, Q.C. in *Hochtief v Argentina*, para [36].\n\n119.\n\nIn *Philip Morris v Uruguay,* the tribunal did not decide whether a similar domestic litigation requirement in the Swiss-Uruguay BIT went to jurisdiction or admissibility. However, it concluded that '[e]ven if that requirement were considered as pertaining to admissibility, its compulsory character would be evident'.220 In that case, however, the BIT provision used 'shall' rather than 'may' in relation to submission to domestic courts.221\n\n*Philip Morris S\u00e0rl, Philip Morris Products S.A and Abal Hermanos S.A. v Oriental* *Republic of Uruguay* (*Philip Morris v Uruguay*), ICSID Case No ARB/10/7, Decision on Jurisdiction, 2 July 2013, para [142].\n\nIbid, para [139]\n\n120.\n\nThe tribunal in *Hochtief v Argentina*222 did not decide whether the dispute resolution clause in the Argentina-Germany BIT imposes an 18-month submission to national courts as a precondition of unilateral recourse to international arbitration. It should be noted that the Argentina-Germany BIT states that the dispute 'will' ('sera') be submitted to national courts whereas the Argentina-Italy BIT states that it 'may' ('podra') be so submitted.223 The *Hochtief v Argentina* tribunal was doubtful that the precondition existed given that it might result in 'pointless litigation'.224 But without deciding the point, it proceeded on the assumption that the precondition did exist.225\n\n*Hochtief v Argentina*.\n\nThe tribunal in *Impregilo v Argentina* found that this difference in terminology did not necessarily mean that a substantive difference was intended: *Impregilo v Argentina*, Award, para [86]. In *Philip Morris v Uruguay*, the tribunal said the use of the word 'shall' evidenced that each step in the domestic proceedings provision in the Swiss-Uruguay BIT is part of a 'binding sequence'. *Philip Morris v Uruguay,* Decision on Jurisdiction, paras [139]-[140].\n\n*Hochtief v Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para [51].\n\nThe tribunal interpreted the operation of the dispute resolution clause based on a broad operation of the MFN clause. It found that the MFN provision applied to the dispute resolution provision in the BIT. *Hochtief v Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction, paras [49]-[55].\n\n121.\n\nThe tribunal in *BG Group v Argentina*226 discussed difficulties litigating in Argentina in the period 2002-2007 in the context of the domestic litigation requirement under the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT.227 Article 8 of the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT relevantly reads:\n\n...The aforementioned disputes shall be submitted to international arbitration in the following cases:\n\n(a) if one of the Parties so requests, in any of the following circumstances:\n\n(i) Where, after a period of eighteen months has elapsed from the moment when the dispute was submitted to the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made, the said tribunal has not given its final decision\u2026228\n\n*BG Group Plc v The Republic of Argentina* (*BG Group v Argentina*), UNCITRAL Arbitration, Final Award, Washington, 24 December 2007.\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, 11 December 1990, entered into force 19 February 1993.\n\nArgentina-United Kingdom BIT, Art. 8(2).\n\n122.\n\nBG Group had not sought to litigate in the domestic courts. The tribunal found that investors acting under the Argentina-United Kingdom BIT had to litigate in the host state's courts for 18 months before they could bring an arbitral claim. However, 'as a matter of treaty interpretation' the tribunal found that it could not construe Article 8(2)(a)(i) as an absolute impediment to arbitration. The tribunal had regard to measures taken by the Argentine executive branch seeking to exclude 'litigious licensees from the renegotiation process',229 and concluded:\n\n\u2026Where recourse to the domestic judiciary is unilaterally prevented or hindered by the host State, any such interpretation [that the domestic litigation requirement is absolute] would lead to the kind of absurd and unreasonable result proscribed by Article 32 of the Vienna Convention, allowing the State to unilaterally elude arbitration, which has been the engine of the transition from a politicized system of diplomatic protection to one of direct investor-State adjudication.230\n\n*BG Group v Argentina*, Final Award, para [155].\n\nIbid, para [147].\n\n123.\n\nSalini Impregilo does not seek to rely on any action that it has itself taken in order to satisfy Article 8(2) and 8(3) of the BIT. The question is whether Puentes' actions satisfy Article 8(2) and 8(3) in order for Salini Impregilo to bring an arbitration. If so, the further question relates to the subject matter of the dispute and the form of action taken: whether either of the two actions undertaken by Puentes satisfies the requirement of submission of the dispute to the 'competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction' of Argentina for 18 months. Those two actions are:\n\ni. an administrative complaint brought on 11 June 2013 by letter;231 and\n\nii. an action before the Argentine court commenced on 30 May 2014.\n\nExhibit C-0049 is the letter seeking to commence that action; Salini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [44]; Salini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [45].\n\n*Interpretation of 'dispute' in Article 8*\n------------------------------------------\n\n124.\n\nThe term 'dispute' ('*controversia*') is not defined in the Argentina-Italy BIT. The ICSID Convention also does not define 'dispute' for the purpose of Article 25(1).\n\n125.\n\nSalini Impregilo assigned its rights and obligations to Puentes under the Concession Contract.232 On this basis Salini Impregilo could not have litigated in domestic courts under the Concession Contract, as Argentina notes.233\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [20]; Exhibit RA-004 (Deed of Transfer).\n\nArgentine Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [146]. Cf *Urbaser S.A. v Argentine Republic* (*Urbaser v Argentina*), ICSID Case No ARB/07/26, Decision on Jurisdiction, 19 December 2012, para [62].\n\n126.\n\nIn *Impregilo S. v Argentina*, Argentina argued that Impregilo had not complied with the 18-month requirement.234 Impregilo responded that the domestic subsidiary had 'consistently resorted to local administrative and judicial courts' in relation to the dispute. It further argued that Argentine courts had had the opportunity to decide on the facts but had failed to do so.235 The tribunal found that the condition in Article 8(3) had not been complied with, without discussing whether AGBA's action could assist Impregilo to satisfy the condition.236\n\n*Impregilo v Argentina*, Award, para [53].\n\nIbid, para [68].\n\nIbid, para [90]. Ultimately the tribunal found jurisdiction based on an expansive reading of the MFN clause as applying to the dispute settlement procedures in the BIT, para [104].\n\n127.\n\nHowever, there are numerous cases supporting Salini Impregilo's claim to have satisfied the domestic litigation requirement here, even though the proceedings in Argentina involved Puentes and not Salini Impregilo, and contractual, not treaty claims.\n\n128.\n\nIn *USA v Italy*, a Chamber of the International Court held that local remedies had been exhausted in Italy because a claim brought to the Italian courts was 'essentially' the claim that the United States was seeking to bring as a matter of diplomatic protection. This was despite the fact that 'the parties were different'.237\n\n*USA v Italy,* Judgment, ICJ Reports 1989 p 15, 45-6 (para [58]).\n\n129.\n\nIn *Philip Morris v Uruguay,* Abal, one of the claimants, was a *sociedad an\u00f3nima* organised under Uruguayan law. In 2010, Philip Morris Brands became the direct owner of 100% of Abal.238 Uruguay argued that even if Abal had met the requirements of negotiation and domestic litigation, the other claimants had not. The tribunal decided that Abal had satisfied, on behalf of the other claimants, the BIT's requirement that the parties negotiate for six months. The Tribunal held that, while the administrative oppositions were filed by Abal alone, Abal's actions were aimed at removing the effects of measures which impacted on all the claimants. The tribunal continued that 'due to the identity of positions and interests involved, Abal's actions were to the benefit also of the other Claimants'.239 The tribunal reached a similar conclusion in relation to the domestic litigation clause: even if the domestic proceeding was filed by Abal, Abal had 'clearly acted in the interest\u2026 of the other Claimants, considering that it is wholly owned' by Philip Morris Brands and the brands Abal sells in Uruguay are sublicensed from Philip Morris Brands.240 In its view:\n\nThe term 'disputes' as used [in the dispute resolution clause] is to be interpreted broadly as concerning the subject matter and facts at issue and not as limited to particular legal claims, including specifically BIT claims.241\n\n*Philip Morris v Uruguay*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para [2].\n\nIbid, paras [95]-[97].\n\nIbid, para [114].\n\n*Philip Morris v Uruguay*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para [113].\n\n130.\n\nThe tribunal in *Philip Morris v Uruguay* said that an investor could satisfy the domestic litigation requirement under the applicable BIT in that case by submitting a domestic law claim to the Uruguayan courts, provided that it was based on 'substantially similar facts and subject matter as the BIT claim subsequently submitted' to arbitration.242 The tribunal determined that if the parties to a BIT had wanted to limit investor-state arbitration to claims concerning breaches of the substantive standards in the BIT, they would have said so expressly.\n\nIbid, para [110].\n\n131.\n\nIn *Teinver v Argentina* the respondent (Argentina) argued that a domestic expropriation lawsuit brought by Argentina against the claimant company's Argentine subsidiary, Interinvest,243 could not fulfil the domestic litigation requirement under the Argentina-Spain BIT because the domestic and international claims involved different parties and different causes of action.244 The tribunal disagreed: the fact that the domestic expropriation proceedings were brought by Argentina against Interinvest 'does not prevent those proceedings from counting for purposes of [the BIT's domestic litigation provision] when the subject matter of those proceedings was the same as that before this Tribunal'.245\n\nThe Tribunal does not agree with Respondent's assertion that the subject matter of the expropriation suit in domestic court is not the same as the subject matter of this arbitration. It is true that the Argentine court proceedings only involved the determination of the value of the expropriated assets, while the ICSID proceeding raises specific issues related to the validity of the expropriation (i.e., fair and equitable treatment, arbitrary and unjustified measures, and full protection and security). As a matter of substance, however, the goal of both suits is to make the Claimants (and Interinvest, in the case of the Argentine proceeding) whole for the economic loss suffered as a result of the nationalization.246\n\n*Teinver S.A., Transportes de Cercamas S.A. and Autobuses Urbanos del Sur S.A. v Argentine Republic (Teinver v Argentina*) *,* ICSID Case No ARB/09/1, Decision on Jurisdiction, 21 December 2012, para [3]. Iberia, the Spanish state-owned airline, incorporated Interinvest as a fully-owned Argentine subsidiary in 1994.\n\nIbid, para [85].\n\nIbid, para [133].\n\n*Teinver v Argentina,* Decision on Jurisdiction, para [132].\n\n132.\n\nIn *Urbaser v Argentina*, the tribunal held that:\n\na distinction may be made between the 'dispute' and a claim or cause of action. Article X [a rule on prior submission of disputes to the local courts of the host state] of the BIT does not require that the same cause of action must be brought before the domestic court and the subsequent international arbitral tribunal. \u2026 It also has been noted that the action brought before a local court need not allege a breach of the BIT; it is sufficient that the dispute relates to an investment made under the BIT. The claim before the local courts must be 'coextensive' with a dispute relating to investments made under the BIT. The nature of the 'dispute' brought before domestic courts may be broad. The objective of the judicial filing is indeed to provide the domestic court with an opportunity to fashion a suitable remedy that may obviate international arbitration. For such a result to be reached, it is not necessary for the domestic court to adjudicate the claim within the framework of the BIT.247\n\nIbid, para [181].\n\n133.\n\nThe present Tribunal agrees with the decisions on this point cited above. In its view, it is sufficient for the purposes of Article 8(2) and (3) that the substantive underpinnings of the dispute have been 'submitted to the competent administrative or judicial jurisdiction', whether by the investor or (as here) a local subsidiary. It does not matter whether the BIT claim has been in terms invoked before the administrative or judicial jurisdiction.\n\n*Was the 'dispute' submitted to the local jurisdiction*\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n134.\n\nConsistently with this conclusion, the fact that the claims in the Argentine courts concerned the Concession Contract while Salini Impregilo's arbitration request involves claims under the BIT is not determinative.248 The dispute submitted to Argentine forums by Puentes shared substantially similar facts with the BIT claim subsequently submitted to arbitration by Salini Impregilo. Both related to the same Concession Contract and the same sovereign acts by Argentina.\n\nCf also *Pantechniki v Republic of Albania* (*Pantechniki v Albania*), ICSID Case No. ARB/07/21, Award, para [61].\n\n135.\n\nSalini Impregilo relies on Puentes' administrative complaint of 11 June 2013 in satisfaction of the domestic proceedings requirement in the BIT. Salini Impregilo describes the administrative complaint as 'local proceedings' initiated by Puentes.249 The Tribunal will need to determine whether the sending of a written administrative complaint amounts to the initiation of proceedings for the purpose of Article 8 of the BIT.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [89].\n\n136.\n\nGiven the wording of the Argentina-Italy BIT when compared to other BITs signed by Argentina, it is clear that submission to an entity other than a court could satisfy the requirement of submission to the 'competent administrative\u2026 jurisdiction'. Some BITs signed by Argentina contain similar language to the Argentina-Italy BIT, without reference to courts or tribunals.\n\n\u2022 The Argentina-Austria BIT requires submission to the administrative or judicial jurisdiction ('a la jurisdiccion administrativa o judicial competente');250\n\n\u2022 The Argentina-France BIT requires submission to arbitration or 'juridictions nationales', although the English translation of that section translates 'juridictions nationales' to 'domestic courts'.251\n\nConvention between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Austria for the Promotion and the Protection of Investments, Buenos Aires, 7 August 1992, Art. 8(2). The Spanish is the authentic text.\n\nAgreement on the reciprocal promotion and protection of investments, Paris, 3 July 1991, 3 August 1993, (1993) 1728 UNTS 297. The authentic languages are Spanish and French.\n\n137.\n\nOther BITs signed by Argentina explicitly require submission to a court or tribunal rather than to the 'jurisdiction' of the respondent state.\n\n\u2022 The Argentina-Germany BIT restricts submission of the dispute to 'the competent courts of the Contracting Party' ('los tribunales competentes');\n\n\u2022 The Argentina-United States BIT requires submission to 'the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party' if an investor chooses domestic litigation;252\n\n\u2022 The Argentina-Spain BIT refers to 'competent tribunals of the Party in whose territory the investment was made' ('a los tribunales competentes');253\n\n\u2022 The Argentina-UK BIT refers to 'the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory the investment was made'.254\n\nArgentina-United States BIT, Art. VII(2)(a). Emphasis added. The BIT contains a 'fork' provision, e.g. a choice between domestic litigation and other forms of dispute resolution.\n\nArgentina-Spain BIT, Art X. 2.\n\nAgreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Argentina for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, London, 11 December 1990, entered into force 19 February 1993, Art 8(2)(a)(i).\n\n138.\n\nAt the Hearing, Argentina accepted that the procedure commenced by Puentes with the Argentine administrative authorities could fall within the scope of Article 8(2).255 The Tribunal agrees.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Jurisdiction, 28 November 2017, 43. It maintained its arguments in relation to subject matter of the dispute and parties to the dispute.\n\n*The 18-month domestic litigation requirement: conclusion*\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nLitigation in the Argentine court was commenced by Puentes on 30 May 2014. Salini Impregilo initiated its arbitration on 1 September 2015, fifteen months after Puentes' court case commenced. *Prima facie*, Salini Impregilo has not complied with the requirement to litigate in an Argentine court for 18 months. However, it would be open for the Tribunal to follow the tribunal in *Philip Morris v Uruguay* which held that it could be satisfied by actions occurring after the date the arbitration was instituted to satisfy a jurisdictional requirement.256 In this case the litigation between Puentes and Argentina is still pending. As the tribunal said in *Philip Morris v Uruguay*, to require the claimant to start over and re-file this arbitration now that the 18 months has passed would be a waste of time and resources.257\n\nSee *Philip Morris v Uruguay*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para [144].\n\nIbid, para [148], citing *Teinver v Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para [135].\n\n140.\n\nArticle 8(2) refers in the alternative to 'the competent administrative *or* judicial jurisdiction' (emphasis added). The administrative jurisdiction was triggered by Puentes more than 18 months before the arbitration was commenced, and in the Tribunal's view Article 8(2) was thereby satisfied. Indeed, aside from its argument as to the characterisation of 'dispute', Argentina does not suggest otherwise. Its claim for noncompliance with Article 8(2) and (3) accordingly fails.\n\n**(b) The issue of abandonment (Article 8(4))**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) Argentina's submissions***\n---------------------------------\n\n141.\n\nAlternatively, Argentina complains that Salini Impregilo did not abandon the domestic proceedings, or procure their abandonment, as it should have done under Article 8(4) of the BIT. Article 8(4) reads:\n\n4. From the time arbitration proceedings are commenced, each party to the dispute shall take any such measures as may be necessary to dismiss any pending court proceedings.258\n\nArgentina-Italy BIT, Art 8(4).\n\n142.\n\nIn failing to abandon pending domestic proceedings, Salini Impregilo has not accepted the terms of Argentina's offer to arbitrate under the BIT.259\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [80].\n\n143.\n\nArgentina claims that the failure to dismiss the pending court proceedings is a serious matter because the consent of the States Parties to the BIT was especially aligned with that purpose: Argentina only included the equivalent clause in five of its 58 BITs.260 The purpose of the requirement is to protect the respondent state from having to litigate multiple proceedings in different forums relating to the same measure and to minimise the risk of inconsistent determination of fact and law by different tribunals and of double recovery.261\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [114].\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [79], quoting *Renco Group Inc v Peru* (*Renco v Peru*), ICSID Case No UNCT/13/1, Partial Award on Jurisdiction, 15 July 2016, 193, Legal Authority AL RA 125.\n\n***(2) Salini Impregilo's submissions***\n----------------------------------------\n\n144.\n\nSalini Impregilo argues that it complied with Article 8(4) of the BIT. First, it points out that it relies exclusively on Puentes' 11 June 2013 administrative complaint to satisfy the 18-month rule: that proceeding is over, in its view, because Argentina failed to respond or to resolve it within the time frame provided by the law.262\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [103]. Exhibit C-0374 'Ley de Procedimiento Administrativo', Arts 30-31; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [67].\n\n145.\n\nSecond, Salini Impregilo's interpretation of Article 8(4) is that it imposes a 'best efforts' obligation263 and Salini Impregilo has no power to force Puentes to dismiss its claim. Salini Impregilo only owns 26% of shares in Puentes.264 The 'broad, subject matter' interpretation of 'dispute' and the broad definition of 'investment' support a 'best efforts' interpretation because a party will not necessarily be able to dismiss claims brought by other parties in relation to the same dispute.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [104]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [67].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [105].\n\n146.\n\nFinally, Salini Impregilo argues that Argentina is also in breach of Article 8(4), which imposes a 'best efforts' obligation on both parties.265 An Argentine court summoned Salini Impregilo as a third party to Puentes' court action on 25 October 2016.266 Therefore, Argentina is estopped from arguing that Salini Impregilo is in breach of Article 8(4) whilst Argentina itself is in breach of that article by forcing Salini Impregilo to join a domestic proceeding that it did not initiate and to which it was not a party.267\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [67].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras [106]-[107] ; Argentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [148]; Exhibit C-0060.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [108].\n\n***(3) The Tribunal's analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n147.\n\nIn *Ambiente v Argentina*, the tribunal identified two aspects of Article 8(4) which assist Salini Impregilo.\n\ni. Article 8(4) imposes an obligation on both parties. It 'commits a Party to take the necessary steps to allow the other Party to desist from the domestic proceedings'. This is relevant in this case because Argentina joined Salini Impregilo to domestic proceedings in 2016, long after the initiation of the arbitration.268\n\nii. Once the 18-month term has expired and a party decides to proceed to international arbitration, 'the other Party must, *to the extent possible*, adopt the necessary measures so that no additional costs will arise for the former Party due to the mere fact of exercising a right expressly granted to it by the BIT'.269 The tribunal evidently considered that Article 8(4) involves a 'best efforts' requirement.\n\n*Ambiente v Argentine Republic* (*Ambiente v Argentina*), ICSID Case No ARB/08/9, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 8 February 2013, para [623].\n\nIbid (emphasis added).\n\n148.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees. The law does not require the impossible, and Salini Impregilo was not in a position to withdraw proceedings to which it was not a party. A 'best efforts' interpretation of Article 8(4) is consistent with the Tribunal's conclusion as to the flexible characterization of 'dispute'. To hold otherwise would place minority shareholders at a serious disadvantage in seeking to uphold their rights under the BIT. Finally, there is no danger of double recovery, having regard *inter alia* to the express assurances given by the Claimant in oral argument.270\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Jurisdiction, 29 November 2017, 355-356.\n\n**(c) The Tribunal's Conclusions on Article 8**\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nFor these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Article 8(2) and (3) of the BIT were complied with, and that Salini Impregilo's claim is not inadmissible under Article 8(4) by reason of the non-withdrawal of the Argentine court proceedings following the commencement of the present arbitration. Argentina's second preliminary objection fails.\n\n150.\n\nIn the light of these conclusions, the Tribunal has no need to consider the parties' arguments with respect to the MFN and *res judicata* issues. Nor is it necessary to address Salini Impregilo's arguments with respect to futility and estoppel.\n\n**D. Third Preliminary Objection: Argentine Courts as the Proper Venue**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nAs noted, Puentes is currently litigating its claim against Argentina (commenced on 30 May 2014) in an Argentine court.271 Salini Impregilo has been summonsed as a third party.272\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [5].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paras [106]-[107] ; Argentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [148].\n\n***(1) Argentina's submissions***\n---------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nArgentina argues that, should the Tribunal find that it possesses jurisdiction, the *forum non conveniens* doctrine applies in this case. Argentina maintains that there are reasons of sound administration of justice that lead to the conclusion that Argentine courts are the most appropriate forum to resolve Salini Impregilo's claim.273 Therefore, the Tribunal should refuse to exercise its jurisdiction.\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [8].\n\n153.\n\nArgentina discusses authorities which identify a general legal principle of *forum non conveniens* and concludes that the Tribunal must take into account the existence of a more appropriate forum with jurisdiction to hear the case.274 Argentina argues that its courts have jurisdiction to decide disputes between an Italian investor and Argentina, including claims for non-compliance with the BIT, and that they are the most appropriate forum for Salini Impregilo's claim.275\n\nIbid, paras [134]-[144].\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, paras [77], [125].\n\n154.\n\nFurther, Argentina refers to the reasons given by the domestic judge for issuing a summons for Salini Impregilo to appear in Puentes' pending case. These include that the claim in the arbitration proceedings and Puentes' claim are closely related and that if the claim is granted there would be an overlap in terms of compensation because it is not possible for a recovery action to be filed against the investing companies (Salini Impregilo and Hochtief).276\n\nArgentina, Memorial on Objections to Jurisdiction, para [150].\n\n155.\n\nArgentina argues that Salini Impregilo cannot invoke an alleged violation of the Concession Contract as though it was a breach of the BIT.277 The standards in the BIT should not be applied to contractual relations governed by Argentine law.278 Argentina argues that Salini Impregilo's claim is contractual because Puentes seeks compensation for the consequences allegedly arising from the termination of the Concession Contract in the domestic proceedings.279\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [147].\n\nIbid, para [148].\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [163].\n\n156.\n\nArgentina argues that its domestic courts are the forum in which contractual claims must be decided because the Concession Contract provides that it is governed by Argentine law. The contract also provides that any issue or conflict that may arise from the contract shall be submitted to the Federal Administrative Courts for the City of Buenos Aires.280\n\nIbid, para [162].\n\n157.\n\nIn relation to Salini Impregilo's fear of criminal prosecution of its legal counsel (should Salini Impregilo's claim be heard in Argentina), Argentina indicates that the original complaint in question was filed because of 'genuine concern for the potential commission of attempted fraud'.281 Further Argentina points out that in the same case in which the possible prosecution was raised, the US judge recognised that American courts generally have found Argentina to be an adequate 'alternative forum' to decide disputes.282 Finally, Argentina points to Salini Impregilo's long history of investment in Argentina and its current projects in Argentina to demonstrate that Salini Impregilo does not genuinely feel 'harassed' there.283\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [166].\n\nIbid, para [167].\n\nIbid, para [171].\n\n***(2) Salini Impregilo's submissions***\n----------------------------------------\n\n158.\n\nSalini Impregilo argues that the *forum non conveniens* doctrine is not set out in the BIT's text,284 is not a recognised principle of international law285 or a general principle of law.286 Furthermore the BIT is a *lex specialis* that displaces any considerations of *forum non**conveniens*.287 Salini Impregilo argues that *forum non conveniens* conflicts with ICSID's exclusive jurisdiction, the *lex specialis* in the BIT,288 basic principles of international law and international investment law.289 If a tribunal held that it would not rule upon treaty claims over which it had jurisdiction because it believed that it was more appropriate for a local court to dispose of the dispute, an investor's right to arbitration would be negated.290 Finally, and in any event, Argentina cannot satisfy the elements of *forum non* *conveniens*291.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [152].\n\nIbid, paras [5], [153]; Salini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [4].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [156].\n\nIbid, para [160].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [4].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [157].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [122].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [152].\n\n159.\n\nArgentine courts are not a more appropriate forum because Salini Impregilo's treaty claims are not before those courts.292 Salini Impregilo is only before the Argentine Courts because it was summonsed to appear.293 It is improper for Argentina to force Salini Impregilo to join domestic proceedings and then argue that Salini Impregilo's presence in the proceedings justifies the dismissal of its treaty claim in the arbitration.294\n\nIbid, para [162].\n\nIbid, para [163].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [122].\n\n160.\n\nSalini Impregilo argues that the pending domestic litigation concerns domestic-law claims by Puentes whereas the arbitration involves treaty claims by Salini Impregilo.295 Its treaty claims are not before the Argentine court which will not rule upon them, whatever other holdings it may make.296 Finally Salini Impregilo 'did not and will not assert its treaty claims in that forum'.297\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [162].\n\nIbid, para [162].\n\nIbid, para [163].\n\n161.\n\nIn Salini Impregilo's view the forum-selection clause in the Concession Contract is wholly irrelevant to determine the forum for Salini Impregilo's BIT claims.298 Its claims are not contractual because, among other things, the acts complained of are sovereign acts.299\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [120].\n\nIbid, para [118].\n\n162.\n\nSalini Impregilo opposed joining Puentes' local proceedings because in its view this would violate Article 8(4) of the BIT. Further, it would force Salini Impregilo to litigate a matter that Argentina has been refusing to resolve for years. Finally, in Salini Impregilo's view, it is not a proper party to the domestic litigation because under the Concession Contract and Argentine law, it is not a party to the contract.300\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [107].\n\n163.\n\nSalini Impregilo states that even if it were required to continue waiting before requesting this arbitration (by the application of Article 8 of the BIT) it would, at this stage, be futile to make further attempts at amicable settlement or submission of the dispute to an Argentine court. In its view this would amount to an abuse of rights by Argentina.301\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [60].\n\n164.\n\nFinally, there is a fear that counsel for Salini Impregilo would be criminally prosecuted before Argentine Courts because in September 2015 Argentina announced the initiation of criminal proceedings against several of King & Spalding's attorneys (Salini Impregilo's lawyers), accusing them of having defrauded the country by participating in unrelated international arbitration.302 The *Teinver v Argentina* tribunal rejected all of Argentina's underlying contentions regarding the criminal proceedings.303\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [165].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [123] with reference to *Teinver v Argentina*, Award, 21 July 2017.\n\n***(3) The Tribunal's analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n165.\n\nIn general terms the principle of *forum non conveniens* involves the exercise of a discretion to stay or dismiss proceedings over which a court or tribunal has jurisdiction, on the basis that some other forum is clearly more appropriate for the determination of the dispute.304 Pursuant to the principle a court or tribunal 'has to consider how best the ends of justice in the case in question and on the facts before it, so far as that can be measured in advance, can be respectively ascertained and served'.305\n\n'The Principles for Determining When the Use of the Doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens and Anti-Suit Injunctions is Appropriate', in *Institute of International Law Yearbook* (2002-2003) Vol 70, Part I, Bruges, 22.\n\nIbid, 23, quoting *Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Gaz de Paris v Armateurs Fran\u00e7ais* 1926 SC (HL) 13, 22.\n\n166.\n\nSalini Impregilo argues that 'no investment tribunal has ever recognized the doctrine as a principle of international law or applied it to dismiss a claim over which it had jurisdiction',306 and Argentina cites none in its pleadings. In *Hochtief v Argentina* the tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction said that '[a] tribunal might decide that a claim of which it is seised and which is within its jurisdiction is inadmissible (for example, on the ground of *lis alibi pendens* or *forum non conveniens*)'.307 This appears to recognize the existence of a *forum non conveniens* discretion but there was no further discussion of the concept, still less was it applied in that case.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para [153].\n\n*Hochtief v Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 October 2011, para [90].\n\n167.\n\nIn *GAMI v Mexico* the tribunal rejected the argument that the claimant could not seek redress because the domestic holding company had sought redress in Mexican courts, holding that:\n\nultimately each jurisdiction is responsible for the application of the law under which it exercises its mandate.308\n\n*GAMI Investments v United Mexican States (GAMI v Mexico)*, Final Award, 15 November 2004, para [41].\n\n168.\n\nThe tribunal in *GAMI* quoted with approval the umpire in the *Selwyn* case who said that:\n\nInternational arbitration is not affected jurisdictionally by the fact that the same question is in the courts of one of the nations. Such international tribunal has power to act without reference thereto\u2026309\n\n*GAMI v Mexico*, para [39], quoting J. H. Ralston, *Venezuelan arbitrations of 1903* (Washington, Government Printing Office, 1904) 322, 327.\n\n169.\n\nHowever, that dictum was concerned with jurisdiction, not admissibility.\n\n170.\n\nIn *Impregilo v Argentina*, Argentina's argument based on double recovery (through domestic proceedings and international arbitration) was held to be a mere 'theoretical' argument because the granting of compensation in either sphere would impact on the granting of compensation in the other.310\n\n*Impregilo v Argentina*, Award, 21 June 2011, para [139].\n\n171.\n\nIn favour of deference to domestic proceedings, Douglas states that 'there must be a limiting principle of admissibility of shareholder claims'.311 He gives the example of a major oil company with thousands of shareholders affected by state action who might have recourse under a BIT with the host state. He concludes that the investment treaty regime would be 'doomed as a sustainable systems of investment protection' if each shareholder could bring an admissible claim under the BIT.312 Douglas' comments go to admissibility, not jurisdiction. Further, Salini Impregilo is one of only six shareholders which could seek to litigate this claim (the seventh shareholder, Iglys, being a subsidiary of Salini Impregilo). In the Tribunal's view, concerns in relation to the sustainability of investment protection have no relevance to Salini Impregilo's claim.\n\nZ Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims*, (Cambridge University Press, 2009), 399.\n\nIbid, 399.\n\n172.\n\nHob\u00e9r discusses the possibility of a tribunal declining jurisdiction on the basis of *forum non conveniens* in favour of a parallel proceedings involving the same dispute.313 He suggests that arbitrators should not act in a manner that contradicts international public policy and that they might decline jurisdiction where parallel proceedings are deemed to be unacceptable because of the great injustice they cause the respondent.314\n\nK Hob\u00e9r, *Res Judicata and Lis Pendens*, in (2013) 366 Acad\u00e9mie de Droit International, Collected Courses 99, 250.\n\nIbid, 252.\n\n173.\n\nFor its part, the Tribunal does not need to decide in the abstract whether a BIT tribunal has discretion to stay an arbitration proceeding on account of parallel proceedings pending before a national court. Salini Impregilo never committed to bringing its BIT claims (which are not contractual claims) to the Argentine courts and never did so. It only became a party to the pending Argentine court proceeding against its will, over a year after it had exercised its procedural right as an investor to bring the present arbitration. No new issue of public policy arises with respect to the bringing of a claim by a qualified investor under a BIT. The Tribunal again notes that there is no danger of double recovery, having regard *inter alia* to the express assurances given by the Claimant in oral argument.315 Even if the Tribunal has the power to stay the present proceedings, it has not been shown that it is *forum non conveniens* and it would decline to exercise that power. The Respondent's third preliminary objection accordingly fails.\n\nTranscript, Hearing on Jurisdiction, 29 November 2017, 355-356.\n\n**E. SALINI IMPREGILO'S LACK OF STANDING**\n------------------------------------------\n\n***(1) Argentina's submissions***\n---------------------------------\n\n174.\n\nLate in the pleadings Argentina raised the issue of Salini Impregilo's standing.316 In its view Salini Impregilo cannot bring an arbitral claim as a shareholder in relation to the contractual rights of Puentes. This objection was not formally raised by Argentina as such nor was it addressed by Salini Impregilo as a separate objection to jurisdiction. Nonetheless the Tribunal will deal with it.\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [139].\n\n175.\n\nSalini Impregilo and its consortium partners gave up their rights and obligations under the Concession Contract by transferring them to Puentes.317 Therefore, in Argentina's view Salini Impregilo ceased to be a party to the contract and Puentes stepped in to replace it.318 In Argentina's view Salini Impregilo is not a party to the substantial legal relationship that gave rise to the claim filed against Argentina in the arbitration and is precluded from bringing any claim to the Tribunal in respect of that relationship.319\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [20]; Argentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [136].\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [136].\n\nIbid, para [139].\n\n***(2) Salini Impregilo's submissions***\n----------------------------------------\n\n176.\n\nSalini Impregilo responds that the BIT specifically grants Salini Impregilo standing to bring BIT claims against Argentina and that this is 'established investment arbitration practice'.320 Salini Impregilo and its investment in Puentes qualify respectively as investor and investment under the BIT.321 Salini Impregilo did not relinquish its substantial investment in Argentina by signing the Concession Contract.322\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, para [113].\n\nIbid, paras [109], [113].\n\nIbid, para [110].\n\n177.\n\nIn response to Argentina's claim that Salini Impregilo is bringing claims that are derivative and 'contractual', Salini Impregilo responds that this is not the case: Salini Impregilo, as investor, is bringing BIT claims on its own behalf against Argentina.323 Further, its claim is not contractual because the origin of the action that Salini Impregilo complains of is a sovereign act of Argentina. It was not conduct by Argentina in the exercise of a contractual power.324\n\nIbid, para [111].\n\nSalini Impregilo, Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, paras [118]-[119].\n\n***(3) The Tribunal's analysis***\n---------------------------------\n\n178.\n\nThere is substantial authority to the effect that claims such as those presented by Salini Impregilo enjoy protection under the applicable BIT. There is no reason for this Tribunal to take a different view.325 In particular ICSID decisions show that (absent some express provision in the BIT) there is no material distinction between majority and minority shareholders for jurisdictional purposes326 and that this right to claim compensation is independent from that of the local subsidiary directly affected by the actions of the host state.327\n\nCf *Impregilo v Argentina*, Award, 21 June 2011, para [140].\n\nM Valasek & P Dumberry, *Developments in the Legal Standing of Shareholders and Holding Corporations in Investor-State Disputes* (2011) 26 Foreign Investment Law Journal 47.\n\nIbid, 49-50.\n\n179.\n\nIn *Maffezini v Spain*, Spain argued that the Argentine claimant company was a mere shareholder in a Spanish company and had no standing to sue in his own capacity.328 The tribunal rejected this argument. It referred to the broad definition of 'investment' in the Argentina-Spain BIT329 and concluded that the claimant was 'an Argentine investor in a Spanish company' with *prima facie* standing.330\n\n*Maffezini v Spain*, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 25 January 2000, para [65].\n\nIbid, para [67].\n\nIbid, para [70].\n\n180.\n\nIn *CMS v Argentina*,331 the tribunal discussed Argentina's argument that the claimant lacked standing to proceed with a claim against Argentina because CMS was a minority shareholder in an Argentine company.332 It observed that Article 25 of the ICSID Convention did not attempt to define 'investment'333 and that a broad definition of 'investment' was standardly adopted in BITs. It noted that ownership of shares was one of the specific examples of investment given during the negotiations of the ICSID Convention.334 It concluded that there was no bar to jurisdiction for a minority shareholder in *CMS v Argentina*.335\n\n*CMS Gas Transmission Company v The Republic of Argentina (CMS v Argentina),* ICSID Case No ARB/01/8, (2003) 42 ILM 788, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction.\n\nIbid, para [36].\n\nIbid, para [49].\n\nIbid, para [50].\n\nIbid, paras [53]-[56].\n\n181.\n\nIn *SAUR v Argentina*336 the tribunal focused on the wording of the definition of 'investment' in the Argentina-France BIT which explicitly included shares held by minority shareholders. An interpretation which did not give access to arbitration to a minority shareholder would not only be contrary to the wording of the treaty but also to the aim of the contracting parties, which was to extend the protection of the BIT to all kinds of shareholders.337\n\n*SAUR International v Argentine Republic (SAUR v Argentina)*, ICSID Case No ARB/04/4, Decision of the Tribunal in relation to Objections to Jurisdiction, 27 February 2006.\n\nIbid, paras [87]-[90].\n\n182.\n\nIn *Hochtief v Argentina*, Argentina argued that Hochtief had no standing as it was attempting to bring a claim to enforce the rights of Puentes.338 The tribunal held that Hochtief had standing to bring the action as an investor in Argentina under the Argentina-Germany BIT.339 In particular, it noted the wide definition of 'investment' in the BIT, including 'shares, stocks in companies, and other forms of participation in companies.'340 The tribunal also noted that the conditions of bidding for the project (the bridge and tollway) included operation through a local company.341 The fact that Hochtief had assigned its rights to Puentes (as has Salini Impregilo) confirmed the view that Hochtief's investment consisted in its shares in Puentes and other forms of investment recognised under the Argentina-Germany BIT.342\n\n*Hochtief v Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 October 2011, paras [10], [112].\n\nIbid, para [119].\n\nIbid, para [115]; Argentina-Germany BIT, Art. 1(1)(b).\n\nIbid, para [116].\n\nIbid, para [117].\n\n183.\n\nIn *Impregilo. v Argentina*, Argentina argued that Impregilo was bringing a derivative claim on behalf of the company in which it held shares, and that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to hear this indirect claim.343 The tribunal found that Impregilo's shares in the Argentine company were protected under the BIT because they were included in the BIT's definition of 'investment'.344 If it was shown that the Argentine company was subjected to expropriation or unfair treatment in respect of the concession contract, Impregilo's rights as an investor would have been affected.345\n\n*Impregilo v Argentina*, Award, June 21, 2011, para [111].\n\nIbid, para [138]. The tribunal referred to Argentina-Italy BIT, Art. 1(1)(b) which defines 'Investment' to include 'shares of stock, interests or any other form of participation\u2026in a company'.\n\n*Impregilo. v Argentina*, Award, 21 June 2011, para [138].\n\n184.\n\nIn this case Salini Impregilo, with its consortium partners, formed an Argentine company as required by the terms of the bidding for the Concession Contract. It then transferred its rights and obligations under the Concession Contract to Puentes.346 While Argentina argues that Salini Impregilo is not a party to the legal relationship that gave rise to the claim filed in the arbitration,347 at this jurisdictional stage the Tribunal must have regard to the legal relationship between the parties to the arbitration.\n\nSalini Impregilo, Request for Arbitration, para [20].\n\nArgentina, Reply on Jurisdiction, para [136].\n\n185.\n\nArticle 25 of the ICSID Convention extends the Centre's jurisdiction to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State and a national of another Contracting State.348 Article 25 must be read together with the terms of the BIT, with its broad definition of 'investment'.349\n\nICSID Convention, Art. 25(1).\n\nArgentina-Italy BIT, Art. 1(b).\n\n186.\n\nAs in the BIT applicable in *Hochtief v Argentina* the definition of 'investment' is unequivocal in stipulating that the BIT defines investments to include 'shares of stock\u2026 including minority or indirect interests'.350 Salini Impregilo, like Hochtief, owns 26% of the shares in Puentes (though Salini Impregilo owns 4% of those shared indirectly through Iglys). Salini Impregilo's shares in Puentes are an investment pursuant to the BIT. Salini Impregilo is an investor in Puentes, a company incorporated in Argentina and Salini Impregilo is an Italian national. It therefore has standing to bring this claim.\n\nArgentina-Italy, BIT, Art 1 (b); see *Hochtief v Argentina*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para [115].\n\n**V.

INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES**\n-------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nThis case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"**ICSID**\" or the \"**Centre**\") on the basis of the Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Italy on the Promotion and Protection of Investments which was signed on 22 May 1990 and entered into force on 14 October 1993 (the \"**BIT**\"), and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated 14 October 1966 (the \"**ICSID Convention**\").\n\n2.\n\nThe Claimant is Webuild S.p. A. (previously Salini Impregilo S.p.A.) (\"**Webuild**\" or \"**the Claimant**\"), an Italian industrial group specialising in large civil engineering projects, incorporated under Italian law. On 20 May 2020, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that on 4 May 2020, the shareholders of Salini Impregilo S.p.A. held an extraordinary meeting during which they passed a resolution to change the company's name to Webuild S.p.A.1 Previously, on 26 November 2013, Salini S.p.A. had merged by incorporation into Impregilo S.p.A. On 1 January 2014, Impregilo S.p.A. changed its name to Salini Impregilo S.p.A. Depending on the date of the Parties' submissions, the names of **Salini**, **Salini Impregilo** or **Webuild** are used without distinction to designate the Claimant.\n\nFollowing several submissions from the Parties with reference to the Claimant's change of its corporate name from Salini Impregilo S.p.A. to Webuild S.p.A., on 5 November 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which the Tribunal concluded that it was satisfied with the documents and explanations that had been provided by the Claimant, and would not require further submissions from either Party.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Argentine Republic (\"**Argentina**\" or \"**the Respondent**\").\n\n4.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the \"**Parties**.\" The Parties' representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i). The Tribunal also recalls that during the Hearing on the Merits, the Claimant explained that since it \"needed a local presence on the ground, and Marval, O'Farrell, Mairal has been advising on other issues involving the case for some time, and is one of the most respected firms in the country, and we asked them to help us for the Hearing. So, they are making an appearance on the record for the first time for this Hearing.\"2\n\nTr. Day 1: 21:20 \u2013 22:4.\n\n5.\n\nThe Claimant and other investors formed a Consortium to participate in a bid for the construction of several roads and a series of bridges and embankments, including a 608-meter-long cable-stayed main bridge, which would connect the cities of Victoria and Rosario in the provinces of Entre R\u00edos and Santa Fe in Argentina (hereinafter defined as \"**the Project\")**. The Consortium won the bid, and on 28 January 1998, executed a Concession Contract with the Respondent for the performance of the Project.3 A locally incorporated Argentine company, Puentes del Litoral S.A. (\"**Puentes**\" or the \"**Concessionaire**\"), was created as required by the Concession Contract and began construction in late 1998.4 The Claimant submits that it owns 26% of Puentes' stock and confirms having invested US$ 33.2 million in the Project.5\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 47.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 4.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 170.\n\n6.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Argentina has failed to restore Puentes' \"Concession Contract's economic balance [following the enactment of the Emergency Law,] has hindered Claimant's investment to the point of complete loss, has ended the Concession Contract by using pretextual reasons and has failed to compensate Claimant and Puentes for the adverse economic effects of its unlawful conduct\".6 As a result, the Claimant contends that the Respondent breached several provisions under the BIT, in particular: (i) the fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") standard (Article 2.2); (ii) the non-discrimination standard (Articles 2.2 and 3); and (iii) the obligation not to unlawfully expropriate an investment (Article 5).7 The Claimant also invokes Article 7 of the U.S.-Argentina BIT by way of the most-favored nation clause (\"**MFN**\") under the BIT (Article 3.1).8\n\nRequest for Arbitration, \u00b6 4; Claimant's Memorial, \u00b6 168. Tr. Day 2: 142:18-22, 150:5-14.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 177.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 161-162. The Request for Arbitration identified a larger number of claims than were ultimately set forth in the Memorial (\u00b6 10): \"Argentina has breached at least the following obligations and standards of conduct with respect to Salini Impregilo's investment: Investments by investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall not be nationalized, expropriated, seized or otherwise appropriated, either directly or indirectly, through measures having an equivalent effect in the territory of the other Party, unless the following conditions are complied with: the measures are taken for a public purpose, in the national interest or for security; they are taken in accordance with due process of law; they are non-discriminatory or not contrary to any commitments undertaken; and they are accompanied by provisions for the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation; Each Contracting Party shall always accord fair and equitable treatment to the investments made by the investors of the other Contracting Party; Each Party shall observe any obligations it may have entered into with regard to investments; Neither Party shall impair by unjustified or discriminatory measures, the management, maintenance, enjoyment, transformation, cessation or disposal of investments made in its territory by the other Contracting Party's investors; Each Contracting Party shall, in its own territory, accord to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, to the returns and activities related thereto and to any other matter regulated by this Agreement, a treatment not less favorable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of third countries; Investment shall at all times ... enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than that required by international law; and Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing rights with respect to investments, investment agreements, and investment authorizations.\" (footnotes omitted)\n\n7.\n\nThe Respondent argues that its \"actions showed full support and commitment to the works for the Rosario-Victoria physical connection [\u2026]. In spite of Concessionaire's breaches, the State maintained the Concession, until the time where PdL's shareholders decided to terminate such concession upon dissolution of Concessionaire. The abrupt alteration in the economic and financial balance of the Contract was a result of financing problems faced by Concessionaire and its shareholders, not attributable to the State, prior to the outbreak of the crisis in late 2001 and the adoption by the State of emergency measures to counteract such crisis [\u2026]. Also, the financing difficulties faced by Concessionaire and its shareholders, prior to the crisis and the emergency measures, were the factor leading PdL to file for insolvency proceedings in order to avoid being adjudged bankrupt as petitioned by its subcontractors\".9 As a result, the Respondent asks the Tribunal to reject the Claimant's claims.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 8.\n\n**II. PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n--------------------------\n\n**A. Registration of the Request**\n----------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 1 September 2015, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from the Claimant against the Respondent (the \"**Request**\").\n\n9.\n\nOn 17 September 2015, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Acting Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID's Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.\n\n**B. The Arbitral Tribunal**\n----------------------------\n\n10.\n\nThe Tribunal was originally constituted on 11 July 2016 in accordance with Article 32(7)(b) of the ICSID Convention, and was composed as follows:\n\n(i) Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r, a national of Sweden, appointed by the Claimant;\n\n(ii) Professor J\u00fcrgen Kurtz, a national of Australia and Germany, appointed by the Respondent; and\n\n(iii) Judge James R. Crawford, a national of Australia, appointed by his co-arbitrators in consultation with the Parties.\n\n11.\n\nOn 31 May 2021, the Parties were informed that Judge James R. Crawford had passed away on that day. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2), the proceeding was suspended until the vacancy resulting from Judge Crawford's passing had been filled. The Parties were also informed that pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(1), the vacancy should be promptly filled by the same method by which Judge Crawford's appointment had been made.\n\n12.\n\nOn 8 July 2021, Ms. Lucinda A. Low, a national of the United States, accepted her appointment as President of the Tribunal by the co-arbitrators in consultation with the Parties.\n\n13.\n\nOn 15 July 2021, the Tribunal was reconstituted with Ms. Lucinda A. Low (U.S.), as President, appointed by the co-arbitrators, in consultation with the Parties; Professor Kaj Hob\u00e9r (Swedish), as co-arbitrator, appointed by the Claimant; and Professor J\u00fcrgen Kurtz (Australian/German), as co-arbitrator, appointed by the Respondent. As required under ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2), Ms. Low provided a declaration and a statement, which was circulated to the Parties and the co-arbitrators.\n\n**C. The Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n14.\n\nOn 23 February 2018, the Tribunal issued a Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility (the \"**Decision on Jurisdiction**\"). The Tribunal refers to section III of the Decision on Jurisdiction for the prior procedural history.\n\n15.\n\nThe Respondent raised three preliminary objections to jurisdiction and, additionally, contended that the Claimant lacked standing. Each objection will be addressed here, as a way of summary.\n\n16.\n\nExtinctive prescription was the first preliminary objection raised by Argentina. In the Respondent's view, the Claimant's claims were a matter to be dealt with under Argentine domestic law as provided for in Article 8.7 of the BIT. Since such claims referred to measures taken over a decade ago, they were time-barred.10 On the other hand, the Claimant contended that, to the extent that extinctive prescription existed under international law, Argentina had failed to prove its four cumulative elements.11\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6\u00b6 50, 55, 58.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 68.\n\n17.\n\nThe Tribunal held that the Claimant's international law claims were not to be decided under Argentine domestic law, and it further made a distinction between the limitation of actions due to the passage of time and extinctive prescription. Under international law, the BIT and the ICSID Convention were silent in regard to the time limits for bringing a claim. With respect to extinctive prescription, the Tribunal concluded that the delay in bringing the claim was not attributable to the Claimant and that it was a matter of admissibility rather than jurisdiction.12 The Respondent's first preliminary objection thus failed.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 82-94.\n\n18.\n\nThe second jurisdictional objection raised by the Respondent was the alleged failure by the Claimant to comply with the 18-month local litigation requirement under Article 8 of the BIT. Both Parties agreed that the BIT required the foreign investors to submit any dispute to the competent administrative or judicial local courts before resorting to international arbitration. Puentes had filed an administrative complaint on 11 June 2013 and had initiated local court proceedings in Argentina on 30 May 2014. However, the Respondent contended that Puentes' claims were different than those presented by the Claimant before this Arbitral Tribunal,13 or alternatively, that the Claimant had failed to abandon the domestic proceedings as required by Article 8.4 of the BIT.14 The Claimant refuted the Respondent's position and held that Puentes' proceedings in Argentina had satisfied the local litigation requirement as they dealt with the same subject matter.15\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 103.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 100.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 106.\n\n19.\n\nThe Tribunal, after careful consideration of each of the components of Article 8 of the BIT, concluded: first, that the \"substantive underpinnings\" of the dispute had been correctly submitted to the local jurisdiction as required by Articles 8.2 and 8.3 of the BIT;16 and second, that as to the requirement to abandon domestic proceedings under Article 8.4 of the BIT, the Claimant was not in a position to \"withdraw proceedings to which it was not a party\".17 Therefore, the Respondent's second jurisdictional objection equally failed. Moreover, in the light of these conclusions, the Tribunal found it had \"no need to consider the parties' arguments with respect to the MFN and *res judicata* issues. Nor is it necessary to address Salini Impregilo's arguments with respect to futility and estoppel.\"18\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 133.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 148.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 150.\n\n20.\n\nThirdly, the Respondent requested that if the Tribunal were to assert its jurisdiction, it should apply the *forum non conveniens* doctrine as the Argentine courts were the most appropriate forum to address the Claimant's contractual claims.19 The Claimant contended that its claims referred to breaches of the BIT by the Respondent and, as such, should not be resolved by such forum.20 The Tribunal concluded that the Claimant never \"committed to bringing its BIT claims\u2026to the Argentine courts\".21 In conclusion, Argentina's third jurisdictional objection failed.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 152, 155.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 159.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 173.\n\n21.\n\nFinally, the Respondent raised the issue of the Claimant's lack of standing. The Respondent contended that the Claimant gave up its rights under the Concession Contract by transferring them to Puentes, and by ceasing to be a party was precluded from bringing a claim before the Tribunal.22 The Claimant argued that it was bringing a claim as an investor in relation to its investment, Puentes, under the BIT. The Tribunal agreed with the Claimant's position. Salini/Webuild is an Italian investor whose 26% stock ownership in Puentes qualified as an investment under the provisions of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.23\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 175.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 185-186.\n\n22.\n\nIn conclusion, in its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided:\n\n*(1) To reject the Respondent's preliminary objections to its jurisdiction and to the admissibility of the claims;*\n\n*(2) To reserve all questions of costs to a later stage of the proceedings.*24\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 187.\n\n**D. Procedural History of the Merits Phase**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n23.\n\nOn 3 January 2017, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits accompanied by the witness statements of Messrs. Guillermo Osvaldo D\u00edaz, Martin Lommatzsch and Gabriel Omar Hern\u00e1ndez, as well as the damages expert report of Compass Lexecon (\"**Claimant's Memorial**\").\n\n24.\n\nOn 18 April 2018, after previous exchanges between the Parties and the Tribunal, the Tribunal confirmed the procedural calendar and the hearing reserved dates for the merits phase of the proceedings.\n\n25.\n\nOn 21 June 2018, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits accompanied by the witness statements of Messrs. Mart\u00edn Bes, Eduardo Ratti and Alfredo Eduardo Villaggi, as well as the valuation expert report prepared by Ms. Melani Machinea and Mr. Ernesto Schargrodsky (\"**Respondent's Counter-Memorial**\").\n\n26.\n\nOn 31 October 2018, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the Parties' agreement to extend the procedural calendar for the submission of the subsequent pleadings. After receiving the Respondent's confirmation, the Tribunal granted the Parties' extension.\n\n27.\n\nOn 16 November 2018, the Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits accompanied by the second witness statements of Messrs. Gabriel Omar Hern\u00e1ndez and Martin Lommatzsch, the third witness statement of Mr. Guillermo Osvaldo D\u00edaz, the expert report of Dr. Horacio Liendo, and the expert report of Berkeley Research Group (\"**Claimant's Reply**\").\n\n28.\n\nOn 7 March 2019, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits accompanied by the second witness statements of Messrs. Mart\u00edn Bes and Alfredo Eduardo Villaggi, the witness statements of Ms. Mar\u00eda Paulina Segovia and Mr. Juan Carlos Isi, the second valuation expert report prepared by Ms. Melani Machinea and Mr. Ernesto Schargrodsky, the expert report of Mr. Julio Pablo Comadira, and the expert report of Mr. Pablo Gerchunoff (\"**Respondent's Rejoinder**\").\n\n29.\n\nOn 14 March 2019, the Tribunal confirmed that the Hearing on the Merits would be held in Washington, D.C. from 8 July 2019 to 14 July 2019 (excluding 13 July 2019), as agreed by the Parties.\n\n30.\n\nOn 11 June 2019, the Tribunal decided to postpone the Hearing on the Merits for reasons explained to the Parties; and announced that it would propose new dates for the Parties to hold the Hearing, ideally during the second half of 2019 at The Hague or elsewhere in Europe.\n\n31.\n\nThe Hearing on the Merits was subsequently rescheduled to be held from 17 February to 23 February 2020, at the ICC Paris Centre. On 18 September 2019, the venue was changed to The Hague Hearing Centre.\n\n32.\n\nOn 18 November 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, due to an unforeseen scheduling conflict, the Hearing on the Merits would have to be rescheduled.\n\n33.\n\nOn 6 December 2019, the President of the Tribunal held a conference call with the Parties regarding the rescheduling of the Hearing on the Merits.\n\n34.\n\nFollowing several exchanges between the Parties and the Tribunal, on 8 January 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that the Hearing on the Merits would be held from 19 to 25 October (excluding Saturday, 24 October) 2020 at The Hague Hearing Centre.\n\n35.\n\nBetween 24 June and 15 July 2020, the Parties submitted several communications to the Tribunal concerning the implications of the Covid-19 pandemic for the Hearing on the Merits in the present case.\n\n36.\n\nOn 17 July 2020, the Tribunal, after considering the arguments advanced by both Parties, decided to postpone the Hearing on the Merits until February 2021, and proposed that the Hearing be held remotely on a secure platform. The Tribunal Members could be available on 9-21 February 2021, and invited the Parties to confirm their availability (including witnesses/experts) during the entire period.\n\n37.\n\nOn 18 August 2020, following consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, confirming among others, its decisions: (i) to postpone the Hearing on the Merits that was scheduled to be held in October 2020 at The Hague; (ii) that the rescheduled Hearing would be held remotely; and (iii) that in due course, the Tribunal, in consultation with the Parties, would fix the date for the Organizational Meeting.\n\n38.\n\nFollowing several exchanges between the Parties and the Tribunal, on 9 September 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that the Hearing on the Merits would be held remotely, with (i) a seven-day hearing on 11-17 February 2021 and (ii) two reserved days, 18 and 19 February 2021. Given that the Respondent's witness, Ms. Paulina Segovia, would not be available during those dates, her examination was subsequently scheduled to take place on 2 February 2021.\n\n39.\n\nOn 6 December 2020, the Tribunal circulated, for the Parties' comments, draft Procedural Order No. 5 concerning the organization of the Hearing on the Merits.\n\n40.\n\nOn 6 January 2021, following consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal appointed Professor Freya Baetens as Assistant to the Tribunal in this case. On 15 July 2021, the Parties were informed that the Tribunal had re-confirmed her appointment as Assistant to the reconstituted Tribunal.\n\n41.\n\nOn 18 January 2021, the Tribunal, after considering the Parties' positions on the various items, issued Procedural Order No. 5, with the procedural rules that the Parties had agreed upon and/or the Tribunal had determined would govern the conduct of the Hearing on the Merits.\n\n**E.

Crawford, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 11(1), the co-arbitrators, in consultation with the Parties, appointed Ms. Lucinda A. Low, a national of the United States, as President of the Tribunal, and the Tribunal was reconstituted on 15 July 2021.\n\n46.\n\nOn 26 January 2022, the Tribunal requested either of the Parties to provide the Tribunal with an electronic copy in legible form of Annexes II (Financial Plan) and V (Financial Assistance) to Exhibit C-0171 [\"*First memorandum of Understanding, May 16, 2006 (attached to Letter from Puentes del Litoral to UNIREN, May 16, 2006)*\"].\n\n47.\n\nOn 27 January 2022, the Claimant provided the documents requested by the Tribunal on 26 January 2022. The Claimant also noted that Annex II had been reproduced in Excel Format as Exhibit BD-35 to Ms. Daniela M. Bambaci and Mr. Santiago Dellepiane's Assessment of Damages to Salini Impregilo S.p.A.'s Investments in Argentina, dated 2 January 2017, which they also attached for ease of reference. The Claimant directed the Tribunal in this regard to the hearing transcripts.25\n\nTr. Day 9: 1175:11-1176:10.\n\n48.\n\nBy communication of 1 February 2022, the Respondent provided the Tribunal with a clarification regarding the Claimant's communication of 27 January 2022. The Respondent submitted that Exhibit BD-35 is not a reproduction of the information contained in the 2006 *Acta Acuerdo* and its Annexes, but that it contains additional information. As a result, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to take this into account when considering Exhibit BD-35.\n\n49.\n\nOn 2 February 2022, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that \"following the discontinuance of the proceeding for partial annulment of the award requested by Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft (\"**Hochtief**\"), the award became final and the Argentine Republic fulfilled the obligations thereunder\".\n\n50.\n\nOn 23 April 2022, the Secretary of the Tribunal, on instructions of the President of the Tribunal, provided the Parties with an update on the status of the Tribunal's work.\n\n51.\n\nOn 28 June 2022, the Tribunal requested the Parties' authorization for the Assistant to the Tribunal to be reimbursed for travel and other expenses within the limits prescribed by the ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation, which the Parties did on 30 June 2022.\n\n**III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND**\n---------------------------\n\n52.\n\nBased on its consideration of all the evidence produced in this case, the Tribunal provides below a non-exhaustive summary of the factual background to the dispute.\n\n**A. Argentina's Privatization Reforms**\n----------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nIn the 1990s, with the aim of attracting foreign investment and addressing its hyperinflation, Argentina developed a set of privatization reforms and initiatives.\n\n54.\n\nThe most important reforms were the enactment of Law No. 23,928 (the \"**Convertibility Law**\"), Decree No. 1853/93 (the \"**Foreign Investment Act**\") and Law No. 23,696 (the \"**State Reform Law**\"). Pursuant to the Convertibility Law, the Argentine peso (AR$) was pegged to the United States Dollar (US$) at a rate of US$ 1 to AR$ 1. The Convertibility Law allowed contracts to be denominated in US$.26 According to the Claimant, the fact that a creditor would be paid in US$ and the risk of a declining AR$ would be shifted to the contractual debtor made the Convertibility Law an attractive incentive for foreign investment.27 For its part, the Foreign Investment Act disposed of the obligation on foreign investors to register or seek governmental approval prior to investing in Argentina, and permitted them to repatriate capital and send earnings abroad.28\n\n**Exhibit C-0005**, Law No. 23, 928, Convertibility Law.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 24.\n\n**Exhibit C-0064**, National Decree No. 1853-1993.\n\n55.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, these reforms were advertized in industry publications with the aim of fostering foreign investment and were promoted by State officials. For instance, in November 1993 the Argentine Undersecretariat of Investment published a compendium for foreign investors entitled \"Argentina, a Growing Country\", where the new investor-friendly reforms were advertised.29\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29.\n\n56.\n\nAt the same time, Argentina negotiated several bilateral investment treaties. The first one to be signed was the \"Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Italian Republic on the Promotion and Protection of Investments\" on 22 May 1990 (the \"**BIT**\" or \"**Treaty**\"), the Treaty at issue in these proceedings.30 The signature of these bilateral investment treaties was followed by an amendment to the Argentine Constitution which placed them at a higher rank than Argentina's internal law.31\n\n**Exhibit C-0001**, Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Italian Republic on the Promotion and Protection of Investments.\n\n**Exhibit C-0242**, Law No. 24,430, Argentina Constitution, Art. 75(22), 10 January 1995.\n\n**B. The Bidding Process and the Bridge-and-Toll-Road Concession**\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n57.\n\nThe Project was proposed with the aim of providing a better connection between the provinces of Entre R\u00edos and Santa Fe.32 It was part of a larger goal of improving the East-West connection that joins Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile, which would allow more efficient exchanges between these countries and greater access to the ports of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.33\n\n**Exhibit C-0006**, National Decree No. 855/1995, 12 June 1995, Fourth Whereas; **Exhibit C-0076**, Bidding Terms, July 1997, Annex I, Art. 2.\n\n**Exhibit C-0076**, Bidding Terms, July 1997, Annex I: Project Description, Section 1.\n\n**(1) The Bidding Process**\n---------------------------\n\n58.\n\nOn 6 December 1995, Argentina started the bidding process for the Project by enacting Presidential Decree No. 855/95. The Decree appointed the Argentine Ministry of Economy and Public Works and Services (\"**MEyOSP**\") through the Secretariat of Public Works (\"**SOP** \") as the enforcement authority.34\n\n**Exhibit C-0006**, Presidential Decree No. 855/95, Art. 6.\n\n59.\n\nThe bidding process opened on 15 July 1997 with Argentina's enactment of the *Pliego de Bases y Condiciones del Concurso y sus Circulares* (the \"**Bidding Terms**\").35\n\n**Exhibit C-0076**, Bidding Terms, July 1997, Annex I: Project Description.\n\n60.\n\nThe concession for the Project set forth in the bidding documents (the \"**Concession**\") would operate for 25 years from the date on which the winner of the bid took possession of the Concession. It was a subsidized Concession, meaning that a substantial portion of the construction costs would be funded by the State. There would be no guaranteed minimum revenues or traffic volume and the Concession would be for all purposes a risk contract, except for the subsidy to be granted to the Concessionaire. The Concession would be awarded to the bidder requesting the lowest subsidy.36\n\n**Exhibit C-0007**, National Decree No. 650/1997, 15 July 1997.\n\n61.\n\nTogether with the German international construction group Hochtief and several Argentine construction companies, the Claimant formed a consortium (the \"**Consortium**\") and submitted its bid. As part of its offer, the Consortium presented a Business Plan estimating costs and traffic, as well as a proposal for a subsidy based on the promised toll rates, and which estimated initial construction costs at US$ 350,202,193 and operating expenses over a 21-year period at US$ 410,147,286. According to the Concession's Business Plan, the projected internal rate of return (\"**IRR**\") amounted to 12.94%.37\n\n**Exhibit C-0079**, Consortium's Bid.\n\n62.\n\nArgentina notes that there were two bidding processes, and that in the second bidding process the participating consortia were requested to improve their bids.38\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 11-34.\n\n63.\n\nBy Resolution MEyOSP No. 1039 of 13 November 1997, the Consortium was declared the successful bidder.39\n\n**Exhibit C-0328**, Resolution MEOySP No. 1309/97, 13 November 1997, section 2.\n\n**(2) The Concession Contract**\n-------------------------------\n\n64.\n\nOn 28 January 1998, Argentina and the Consortium executed the 25-year Concession Contract, which was approved by Decree No. 581/1998 on 14 May 1998.40 According to the Claimant, the Bid and the Business Plan submitted by the Consortium are integrated into the Concession Contract as binding documents.41\n\n**Exhibits RA 111 / C-0010**, Decree No. 581/98, 14 May 1998, Arts. 1-2.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 47.\n\n65.\n\nAs required under the Contract, the Consortium incorporated Puentes on 1 April 1998.42 The shareholding structure of Puentes is or was during the relevant period of time divided among Salini S.p.A. (22% held directly and 4% held indirectly via Iglys S.A. for a total of 26%), Hochtief (26%), Techint Compa\u00f1\u00eda T\u00e9cnica Internacional S.A.C.I. (8%), Benito Roggio e Hijos S.A. (20%), Sideco Americana S.A. (19%) and IECSA S.A. (1%). Sideco and IECSA joined after the Consortium was constituted.43\n\n**Exhibit C-0008**, Concession Contract; **Exhibit C-0011**, Puentes' Certificate of Incorporation and Amendments.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 53; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 33.\n\n66.\n\nOn 17 June 1998, all rights and obligations arising from the Concession Contract were assigned by the Consortium to Puentes.44\n\n**Exhibit RA-004**, Deed of Transfer of Rights and Duties.\n\n67.\n\nUnder the Concession Contract, Puentes' equity had to be at least US$ 30 million. The Consortium was required to contribute US$ 7.5 million initially, with the remainder to be contributed within two years.\n\n68.\n\nOn 14 September 1998, Puentes took over the Project by signing the *Acta de Toma de Posesi\u00f3n*.45\n\n**Exhibit C-0126**, Certificate of Puentes Taking Possession of the Concession.\n\n69.\n\nUnder the Concession Contract, Puentes was to undertake construction and operation of the bridges and roads. A few months after construction commenced, the Provinces of Santa Fe and Entre R\u00edos asked Puentes to add a fourth lane to the main bridge, which entailed a review of the Project's construction costs. The expansion was approved by Argentina's Secretary of Public Works and the State's transitory commission overseeing the Project. The construction costs were updated to US$ 384,702,193 and Argentina agreed to pay for the added costs.46\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 54; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 41.\n\n70.\n\nArgentina notes that Puentes had to comply with two obligations within 90 days of the Contract's execution, namely: (i) to submit Firm and Irrevocable Financing Agreements (\"**FIFAs**\"), evidencing that it had the necessary funds to perform its contractual obligations; and (ii) the filing of a stand-by letter of credit.47 This submission deadline was set for 30 October 1998.48\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 42; **Exhibit C-0008**, Concession Contract, Section 22.1.\n\n**Exhibit RA-066**, Record of Transfer of Possession, item 3, 14 September 1999.\n\n71.\n\nOn 15 October 1998, the Claimant secured a letter of credit in favor of Argentina in the amount of US$ 143.1 million.49\n\n**Exhibit C-0083**, Letter from Puentes del Litoral to the Coordinator of the Transitory Commission of the Rosario-Victoria Highway, 30 October 1998.\n\n72.\n\nOn 29 January 1999, the State granted an extension to the Concessionaire until 28 February 1999 to submit the FIFAs and provisionally accepted the commitment letters from the shareholders.50\n\n**Exhibit RA-112**, Resolution MEyOSP No. 86, 29 January 1999, recits.\n\n73.\n\nOn 9 December 1999, upon expiration of the extension granted by Resolution MEyOSP No. 86, the State demanded the submission of the FIFAs within 15 business days.51\n\n**Exhibit RA-234**, Letter from Interim Commission ROS-VOC No. 530/99, 9 December 1999 (free translation).\n\n**(3) Funding of the Project**\n------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe main source of funding for the Project was the subsidy to be paid by the Argentine Government in the amount of US$ 207,100,000. The remaining two sources were the US$ 30 million in equity to be contributed by the Consortium and the Consortium's own funding after the subsidy was paid in full, including third-party loans.52\n\n**Exhibit C-0008**, Concession Contract, Sections 5, 7.\n\n75.\n\nFor payment of the subsidy, Puentes had to submit a monthly certificate of work progress specifying the incurred costs, the works performed and a total amount due for that certificate. Once certified, Argentina was to disburse payment.53\n\n**Exhibit C-0008(A)**, Annex I, Final Technical Document, Section 36.\n\n76.\n\nThe Concession Contract also required a performance guarantee and a bond. The performance guarantee would remain in place until a year after the Project was opened to the public. Its value would be equal to the difference between the construction costs as estimated in the Consortium's bid and the subsidy, plus twenty percent. Argentina had to approve the type and wording of the guarantee. The posting of a US$ 1 million bond was required before the Project opened to traffic to ensure the maintenance and operation of the Concession \u2013 this requirement was duly fulfilled.54\n\n**Exhibit C-0008**, Concession Contract, Section 8.\n\n77.\n\nIt is undisputed between the Parties that Argentina was delayed in some subsidy disbursements. According to the Respondent, the delay resulted from Puentes' breach of its obligation to submit FIFAs and from Puentes' delay in submitting work certificates.55 On 4 July 2000, Argentina temporarily suspended disbursement of the subsidy through Resolution SOP No. 723/00.56\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 177-180.\n\n**Exhibit RA-068**, Resolution SOP No. 723/00.\n\n78.\n\nOn 1 August 2000, Puentes and the Inter-American Development Bank (the \"**IDB**\") concluded a US$ 73,751,000 loan agreement (the \"**IDB Loan**\" or the \"**Loan**\").57 The first Loan disbursement was scheduled for 1 March 2001. Disbursement was subject to certain conditions precedent.\n\n**Exhibit C-0013**, Loan Agreement between IDB and Puentes, 1 Aug. 2000.\n\n79.\n\nThe conditions required by the IDB under the Loan as well as the reasons for its non-disbursement by the IDB are disputed between the Parties. According to the Claimant, the IDB's refusal to disburse was caused by Argentina's failure to pay 90% of the Subsidy by 1 March 2001 and Argentina's then-looming economic crisis.58 For its part, the Respondent contends that the IDB Loan was not a FIFA as required by the Concession Contract, and that a fundamental reason for the IDB's failure to disburse the Loan was the negative result of an updated traffic study of June 2001 that the Consortium had commissioned at the IDB's request.59\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 24.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 50.\n\n80.\n\nOn 20 October 2000, Puentes and Argentina entered into an agreement, the nature of which is disputed between the Parties (\"***Acta Acuerdo***\").60\n\n**Exhibit C-0086**, Agreement between Puentes and Argentina (*Acta Acuerdo*).\n\n81.\n\nThe Claimant contends that *Acta Acuerdo* was a settlement agreement concluded between the Parties to prevent the IDB from refusing to disburse the Loan. According to the Claimant, the *Acta Acuerdo* (i) included the Parties' understanding that timely payment of the subsidy was an essential condition for the disbursement of the Loan, (ii) recognized that Puentes had complied with its contractual requirements to ensure sufficient funding for the Project, (iii) bound Argentina to make subsidy payments in the total amount of US$ 29,989,274 by 15 December 2000, and (iv) obliged Argentina to make future payments according to a payment schedule. Under the *Acta Acuerdo*, Puentes would dismiss all administrative appeals it had filed against Argentina, open the Project to traffic by 15 September 2002 and stop the accrual of interest on past due payments.\n\n82.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the *Acta Acuerdo* (i) never amended the Concession Contract, (ii) was not backed by any precedents nor ratified by any resolution or decree, and (iii) was contingent upon Puentes' commitment to invest all the proceeds of the IDB Loan in the works and increase its capital stock, which did not occur.61\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 80.\n\n83.\n\nOn 26 February 2001, Puentes informed the IDB that Argentina had not paid 90% of the subsidy as required by the conditions precedent to Loan disbursement. Puentes requested a waiver to meet this condition by September 2001. According to the Claimant, the IDB did not respond.62\n\n**Exhibit C-0089**, Letter from Puentes to the IDB, 26 February 2001; Claimant's Memorial, \u00b6 58.\n\n84.\n\nBy May 2001, Argentina had paid 90% of the subsidy and Puentes, its shareholders and Argentina engaged in communications and meetings with the IDB urging it to disburse the first part of the Loan.63\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 58; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 126-129.\n\n85.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, one of the IDB Loan's conditions precedent obliged Puentes' shareholders to increase their equity by US$ 13,650,000 prior to the first disbursement. The Claimant asserts that, in December 2000, the shareholders were forced to inject this equity to cover the deficit caused by Argentina's late payments.64\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 57.\n\n86.\n\nOn 25 July 2001, Puentes wrote to Argentina asking it to rebalance the Concession.65 The reasons for the request are disputed between the Parties. While the Claimant asserts that it requested the rebalancing due to Argentina's changed economic circumstances,66 the Respondent submits that Puentes' request was motivated by its own financial situation.67\n\n**Exhibit R-071**, Letter from Puentes to the Chief of Cabinet, 25 July 2001.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 40.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 122-124.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that it decided to provide more funding in the form of inter-company loans to ensure continuation of the construction works. According to the Claimant, from September to December 2001, it loaned Puentes US$ 6,481,667.00.68\n\n**Exhibit C-0095**, Loan Agreement between Salini Impregilo S.p.A. and Puentes del Litoral (for US$ 880,000), 8 December 2001; **Exhibit C-0096**, Loan Agreement between Salini Impregilo S.p.A. and Puentes del Litoral (for US$ 2,691,000), 8 December 2001; **Exhibit C-0097**, Loan Agreement between Salini Impregilo S.p.A. and Puentes del Litoral (for US$ 1,010,667), 8 December 2001; **Exhibit C-0098.**\n\n**C. Argentina's Economic Crisis**\n----------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Enactment of the Emergency Law**\n------------------------------------------\n\n88.\n\nIn Argentina's view, its economy began to slow down at the end of 1998 due to the drying up of capital flows to emerging markets. The recession prolonged and deepened into the worst economic and social crisis that Argentina had ever faced, affecting severely the provinces of Entre R\u00edos and Santa Fe. The Respondent further states that the unsustainability of the convertibility regime became apparent by the end of 2001.69\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 195-207.\n\n89.\n\nOn 6 January 2002, Argentina enacted Law No. 25,561 (the \"**Emergency Law**\"), which declared a public emergency in its economic, financial, and currency exchange sectors. The Emergency Law (i) repealed the AR$ 1 to US$ 1 ratio established by the Convertibility Law, (ii) converted public-contract obligations denominated in U.S. Dollars into Argentine pesos at the rate AR$ 1 to US$ 1, (iii) set aside the contractual indexation clauses based on price indices of other countries; and (iv) ordered the Argentine Government to renegotiate contracts affected by the Emergency Law within 180 days.70\n\n**Exhibit C-0014**, the Emergency Law.\n\n90.\n\nThe Parties do not dispute that the Emergency Law affected the Concession Contract. Puentes would no longer be entitled to collect the toll rate at the actual currency exchange rate and future toll rates would no longer be adjusted to the U.S. Consumer Price Index.\n\n91.\n\nOn 25 June 2002, Argentina enacted Decree No. 1090/2002, dictating that all claims against the Government for breach of contract had to be resolved within the renegotiation process and that any company filing a claim for breach of contract against Argentina after the enactment of the Decree would be automatically excluded from the renegotiation process.71\n\n**Exhibit C-0108**, Decree No. 1090/2002, 25 June 2002, Art. 1.\n\n92.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, due to the enactment of the Emergency Law, the IDB determined that it would re-evaluate the Loan after Argentina and Puentes had renegotiated the Concession Contract. On 28 June 2002, the IDB terminated the Loan Agreement. The Claimant submits the IDB did so because of the economic crisis, and the enactment of the Emergency Law and its effect on the tariff structure.72\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 66.\n\n**(2) Shareholder Loans and the Financial Assistance Loan**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n93.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, on 17 January 2002, Salini and Hochtief loaned Puentes US$ 5,500,000 and US$ 4,370,000, respectively, to enable Puentes to finalize the nearly complete main bridge, which was finished in its entirety on 5 February 2002.73 (In this Decision, loans from Salini and Hochtief will be referred to collectively as the **\"Shareholder Loans\";** Shareholder Loans made by Salini will be referred to as the **\"Webuild Shareholder Loans\",** and Shareholder Loans made by Hochtief will be referred to as the **\"Hochtief Shareholder Loans\"**.)\n\n**Exhibit C-0416**, Minutes of Puentes' Board of Directors, 17 January 2002.\n\n94.\n\nOn 21 March 2002, the Argentine Government asked Puentes to attend a meeting and submit a presentation explaining how the Emergency Law was affecting the Concession.74 Puentes provided the requested presentation on 26 April 2002, in which it estimated damages due to the Emergency Law in the amount of US$ 130,854,000 and explained that the Emergency Law had (i) slowed down construction due to a lack of funding, and (ii) prevented third-party funding. Puentes informed Argentina that it could no longer unilaterally finance the Project and that to resume work as well as finish construction Argentina would need to provide AR$ 60 million.75\n\n**Exhibit C-0023**, Letter from the Ministry of Economy to Puentes, 21 March 2002.\n\n**Exhibit C-0024**, Letter from Puentes to the President of the Renegotiation Contract Commission, 26 April 2002.\n\n95.\n\nOn 22 October 2002, the Government and the provinces of Entre R\u00edos and Santa Fe entered into an agreement to complete the works pursuant to which Argentina would provide the required funds.76\n\n**Exhibit RA-076**, Agreement between the Argentine State and the provinces of Entre R\u00edos and Santa Fe, 22 October 2002.\n\n96.\n\nOn 26 November 2002, Argentina notified Puentes that it would provide funding as an advance payment of future compensation for the reduction in the toll fee.77\n\n**Exhibit C-0118**, Letter from the Undersecretary of Coordination for the Secretary of Public Works to Puentes, 26 November 2002.\n\n97.\n\nOn 3 February 2003, Argentina enacted Presidential Decree No. 172 approving the model for a loan agreement in the amount of AR$ 51,648,352. Under the loan agreement, Puentes would use future toll revenue to repay the loan, net of its operating and maintenance expenses. The interest rate would be set in accordance with rates published by the Argentine Central Bank for loans with similar characteristics. The agreement indicated that the Argentine Secretary of Public Works would determine the specific repayment process at a later stage.78\n\n**Exhibit C-0015**, Decree No. 172/2003, 3 February 2003.\n\n98.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Puentes \"had no choice but to accept the offered loan\" since Argentina informed Puentes that if it did not accept it, Argentina would declare Puentes in default, terminate the Concession and draw on the guarantees of Puentes' shareholders.79\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 79.\n\n99.\n\nThe loan agreement was executed on 21 February 2003 and on 4 March 2003, Argentina disbursed the initial tranche of the loan (the \"**Financial Assistance Loan\"** or \"**FAL\"**). The FAL was secured: Under section 3 of the FAL Agreement, Puentes assigned the right to collected tolls (net of operating and maintenance costs) to the Road Infrastructure Trust Fund (*Fondo Fiduciario de Infraestructura Vial*).80\n\n**Exhibit C-0119**, Agreement between the Ministry of Economy and Puentes, 21 February 2003.\n\n100.\n\nAs a result of the Agreement, construction resumed, and the Project was opened to the public on 23 May 2003.81\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 81.\n\n101.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, after the Project opened to traffic, several failures were detected in the road and Puentes' repair works were never completed.82\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 133-140.\n\n102.\n\nAfter disbursing AR$ 39.6 million of the FAL on 4 March 2003, Argentina made no further payments of the agreed AR$ 51,648,352.83 According to the Claimant, this forced Salini and Hochtief to provide additional Shareholder Loans to Puentes to allow it to complete the construction of the Project. In particular, the Claimant provided US$ 3,439,390.37 in Webuild Shareholder Loans in 2003.84\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 82.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n**(3) Resolution 14**\n---------------------\n\n103.\n\nOn 30 June 2003, Argentina issued Resolution SOP No. 14/03 (\"**Resolution 14**\"),85 which (i) increased the interest rate on the FAL to the one used for short-term (30-day), unsecured loans, (ii) provided that interest on the Financial Assistance Loan was to be compounded daily, (iii) pesified the maintenance and operating expense allowances contained in the Bid at 1997 values without updating the amounts to account for inflation, (iv) provided that toll revenue would be allocated to repayments of the Financial Assistance Loan on a daily basis, and (v) provided that the amounts that Puentes could not pay would be added to the Financial Assistance Loan's principal on a daily basis. While the Claimant asserts that Resolution 14 increased the interest rate (which the FAL had pegged at the rate set by the Argentine Central Bank for loans with similar characteristics), the Respondent rejects such assertion and submits that the Resolution alone determined the applicable rate.86\n\n**Exhibit C-0018**, Resolution 14, 30 June 2003.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 83; Respondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 245.\n\n104.\n\nOn 26 August 2003, Puentes challenged Resolution 14 before the competent administrative authorities and requested an immediate stay pending determination of the challenge.87As the tribunal in the *Hochtief v. Argentina* ICSID arbitration (the \"***Hochtief*** **Arbitration**\") noted: \"neither the appeal nor the stay were acted upon by the Public Administration\",88 so Puentes was forced to comply with Resolution 14.\n\n**Exhibit C-0016**, Puentes' Administrative Challenge.\n\n**CL-0013**, *Hochtief AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Decision on Liability, 29 December 2014, (\"***Hochtief***, **Decision on Liability**\"), \u00b6113.\n\n105.\n\nTo cover Puentes' operating expenses, Salini and Hochtief provided additional Shareholder Loans. From 2003 to 2005, the Claimant loaned Puentes US$ 9,051,804.37 in Webuild Shareholder Loans.89\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 104.\n\n**D. The Renegotiation of the Concession Contract and Puentes' Insolvency Proceedings**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nUnder the Emergency Law, as noted earlier, Argentina was ordered to renegotiate all public works contracts.\n\n107.\n\nThrough Presidential Decree No. 311/03, Argentina created the Unit of Renegotiation and Analysis of Public Utility Contracts (\"**UNIREN**\") within the Ministry of Economy and Production and the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services. UNIREN was put in charge of coordinating the renegotiation proceedings under the Emergency Law.90\n\n**Exhibit C-0137**, Presidential Decree No. 311/03, 3 July 2003.\n\n108.\n\nAccording to Presidential Decree No. 311/03, once the public hearing and public consultation processes encouraging citizen participation had taken place, the Office of the Treasury Attorney General would issue an opinion. Assuming the new terms were approved in this opinion, the renegotiation agreements would then be jointly signed by the Ministry of Economy and Production and the Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, and *ad referendum* of the Argentine Executive Branch.91\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 278.\n\n109.\n\nOn 18 March 2002, the Ministry of Economy issued Resolution 20, which approved the regulations and procedures for the renegotiation of public works contracts.92\n\n**Exhibit C-0140**, Resolution No. 20/2002, 18 March 2002.\n\n110.\n\nOn 6 April 2005, Puentes, UNIREN and the *\u00d3rgano de Control de Concesiones Viales* (\"**OCCOVI**\"), the entity in charge of regulating road concession projects, agreed on a protocol for the renegotiation of the Concession (the \"**Renegotiation Protocol**\"). The Renegotiation Protocol called for Argentina and Puentes to approve the terms for a renegotiated agreement within 45 days.93\n\n**Exhibit C-0169**, Minutes of Meeting to discuss Renegotiation Protocol, 6 April 2005.\n\n111.\n\nOn 16 May 2006, the Parties subscribed to a letter of understanding (the \"**First LOU**\" or \"**2006 LOU**\").94 The First LOU provided for an increase in toll rates to \"partially re-establish the economic-financial balance of the concession which was affected by the economic emergency\", through, among other provisions:\n\n- Increasing the toll rate for two-axle vehicles from AR$ 9.00 to AR$ 12.87 (the average increase across all the toll rate segments was 104.46%);95\n\n- Providing that Argentina would subsidize this rate increase via a Government trust so that users would not absorb any of the rate increase;96\n\n- Allowing for further toll rate increases at the end of 2007 if certain costs increased by 5% according to an Argentine inflation index;97\n\n- Amending Resolution 14 by reducing the applicable interest rate (from rates applied to unsecured 30-day loans to rates applied to first-rate companies or 9.5%, whichever was higher);98\n\n- Providing that a full and final renegotiation to completely restore the Concession's economic equilibrium would take place within twelve months;99\n\n- Pesifying the shareholders' performance bonds and letters of credit at a rate of US$ 1 = AR$ 1),100 and;\n\n- Requiring the Government to hold a public hearing for the First LOU to become enforceable.101\n\n**Exhibit C-0171**, First Letter of Understanding (LOU), 16 May 2006. This document is also referred to in the Parties' and Experts' submissions as an MOU.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 V and Annex IV.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 XII.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 VI.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 IX.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 IV.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 VII.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 XIII.\n\n112.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the First LOU changed the conditions for the repayment of amounts granted under the Financial Aid Agreement.102 Argentina also argued that the First LOU did not become effective due to Puentes' failure to regularize the situation with its creditors.103\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 293.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 294.\n\n113.\n\nOn 19 January 2007, Argentina issued the \"Report on the Merits of the Memorandum of Understanding UNIREN \u2013 PUENTES DEL LITORAL S.A.\" (the \"**2007 Renegotiation Report**\").104 According to the Claimant, the report explained why the first letter of understanding was justified and why Argentina should give it effect. The Claimant further asserts that Puentes did not learn about the 2007 Renegotiation Report until after signing the second letter of understanding (the \"**Second LOU**\" or \"**2007 LOU**\").105\n\n**Exhibit C-0103**, Renegotiation Report.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 111-113.\n\n114.\n\nOn 27 February 2007, the Parties entered into the Second LOU, which changed some of the key provisions of the First LOU. Under the new letter, the balance of the Financial Assistance Loan would be converted into equity and Salini and Hochtief had to increase their shareholdings in Puentes by converting into equity the unpaid balance of their Shareholder Loans up to the amount necessary to stabilize Puentes' financial condition.106\n\n**Exhibit C-0175**, Second Letter of Understanding, 27 February 2007.\n\n115.\n\nOn 24 April 2007, Boskalis-Ballast Nedam Baggeren (\"**Boskalis-Ballast**\"), one of Puentes' principal subcontractors, petitioned to place Puentes into bankruptcy in an effort to collect an unpaid arbitration award (\"the **ICC Arbitration\")**.107 From 1998 until 2001, Puentes had paid Boskalis-Ballast US$ 64 million, after which Puentes owed Boskalis approximately US$ 32 million.108\n\n**Exhibit C-0184**, Letter from Puentes to UNIREN informing it of Boskalis-Ballast's request.\n\n**Exhibit CWS-0001**, Witness Statement of Guillermo O. D\u00edaz, 27 December 2016, \u00b6 24.\n\n116.\n\nTo avoid liquidation, Puentes initiated reorganization proceedings on 2 May 2007. The Claimant asserts that it informed Argentina about the commencement of the proceedings on 8 May 2007.109\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 123.\n\n117.\n\nOn 10 May 2007, Argentina repudiated the Second LOU, alleging that Boskalis-Ballast's claim and the reorganization proceedings had changed the circumstances upon which it had been negotiated. According to the Respondent, over the course of the hearing in the *Hochtief* Arbitration,110 it learned that Hochtief held a 48% interest in Ballast Nedam, one of the joint venture partners in Boskalis-Ballast, and that Puentes failed to inform OCCOVI that it would hire a third party related to Puentes.111 To the contrary, the Claimant asserts that Puentes did inform Argentina of its contract with Boskalis-Ballast112 and that, in any event, Hochtief did not have a shareholding interest in the joint venture itself.113\n\n*See \u00b6\u00b6* 205 *et seq. infra*.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 150.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 84.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 85.\n\n118.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, in June 2008 the court overseeing the reorganization proceedings ordered UNIREN to continue the renegotiation of the Concession Contract.114\n\n**Exhibit C-0040**, Court Order in Puentes del Litoral S.A. s/insolvency proceedings, 11 June 2008, p. 1508.\n\n119.\n\nArgentina notes that it held a claim in the reorganization proceedings for the financial aid granted to Puentes under the FAL. The reorganization court allowed Argentina's claim in the amount of AR$ 38,915,075.68.115\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 248-249.\n\n**E. The Transitory Agreements**\n--------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nOn 17 December 2009, the Parties agreed on a transitory agreement (the \"**First Transitory Agreement**\").116 The Claimant notes that the First Transitory Agreement did not require a public hearing for its ratification.117\n\n**Exhibit C-0042**, First Transitory Agreement, 17 December 2009.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 128.\n\n121.\n\nThe Claimant notes that the First Transitory Agreement provided for, *inter alia*, (i) an internal rate of return on the Project of 8.87% calculated in constant pesos from September 1997; (ii) renegotiation of the Concession Contract within twelve months from the date of signing the transitory agreement; and (iii) denunciation by either party of the agreement leaving it without effect in the event that it did not enter into force within 60 days from the date of signature.\n\n122.\n\nOn the basis of Puentes' consent to the First Transitory Agreement, Puentes requested the court overseeing its reorganization proceedings to approve a settlement agreement with its creditors.118 The settlement agreement became enforceable when it was approved by the bankruptcy court. According to the Claimant, Puentes paid several instalments under the creditor settlement agreement, including US$ 8.3 million to Boskalis-Ballast and US$ 4,089,561 to the State for the Financial Assistance Loan.119\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 131; **Exhibit C-0206**, Court Order in Puentes del Litoral S.A. s/insolvency proceedings, 30 December 2009.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 134.\n\n123.\n\nArgentina proposed a second transitory agreement, which was signed by Puentes on 14 June 2010 (the \"**Second Transitory Agreement**\").120 Argentina issued the required notices in March 2011 and held the required hearing on 17 June 2011, during which an amendment to the transitional tariff regime was discussed.121\n\n**Exhibit C-0044**, Second Transitory Agreement, 14 June 2010.\n\n**Exhibit C-0214**, UNIREN's Final Report on Public Hearing, 30 June 2011.\n\n124.\n\nAs a result, a new transitory agreement (the \"**Third Transitory Agreement**\") was proposed, which was signed by Puentes on 13 October 2011.122\n\n**Exhibit C-0047**, Third Transitory Agreement, 13 October 2011.\n\n125.\n\nIn February 2012, the Office of the *Procurador del Tesoro de la Naci\u00f3n* issued a series of recommendations including formalistic changes and recommended that a new agreement be signed.123\n\n**Exhibit C-0210**, Report by Argentina's Office of the Treasury Attorney General, 29 February 2012.\n\n126.\n\nOn 6 March 2012, Puentes agreed to and signed a new transitory agreement (the \"**Fourth Transitory Agreement**\").124\n\n**Exhibit C-0048**, Fourth Transitory Agreement, 6 March 2012.\n\n**F. Termination of the Concession Contract**\n---------------------------------------------\n\n127.\n\nBy 2012, Puentes' accumulated losses exceeded its equity value.125 According to the Claimant, to avoid dissolution under Argentine law, Puentes' shareholders agreed to increase its equity by AR$ 1 million (approximately US$ 350,000). The Claimant asserts that Puentes' shareholders conditioned the new equity contribution on Argentina approving the amended bylaws, including the increase in Puentes' equity, and ratifying the Fourth Transitory Agreement.126\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 144.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n128.\n\nSubsequently, Puentes asked the Government for approval to amend its bylaws and increase its social capital or equity on several occasions. According to the Respondent, the Claimant's request would have effectively decreased the capital stock provided for in the Concession Contract, and it did not grant the requested approval.127\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 336.\n\n129.\n\nOn 10 June 2013, Puentes denounced the Fourth Transitory Agreement.128 The next day, it filed an administrative complaint against Argentina for breach of the Concession Contract alleging that Argentina had failed to restore the Concession's economic equilibrium and claiming damages.129\n\n**Exhibit C-0233**, Letter from Puentes to Ministry of Federal Planning, Public Investment and Services, 10 June 2013.\n\n**Exhibit C-0049**, Administrative Complaint filed by Puentes, No. 46/13, File SO1 0123098/2013, 11 June 2013.\n\n130.\n\nOn 30 May 2014, Puentes filed a lawsuit in Argentine courts. The suit sought the Concession Contract's rescission due to Argentina's failure to re-establish its economic equilibrium, as well as damages. The action was pending before the Argentine courts at the time of the submissions in this case;130 the Tribunal does not know its current status.\n\n**Exhibit C-0009**, Complaint *in Puentes del Litoral S.A. v. Argentina*, 30 May 2014.\n\n131.\n\nOn 30 June 2014, Puentes' board decided to dissolve the company.131 The Tribunal does not know at this writing whether it has in fact since been dissolved.\n\n**Exhibit C-0234**, Minutes of Puentes' Board of Directors' Meeting, 30 June 2014.\n\n132.\n\nOn 26 August 2014, Argentina issued a resolution terminating the Concession Contract (the \"**Termination Resolution**\").132 The reasons for the Termination Resolution are disputed between the Parties. According to the Claimant, the Termination Resolution cites four grounds to justify attributing fault to Puentes: (i) the reorganization proceedings of Puentes; (ii) the *Hochtief* Arbitration; (iii) Puentes' board's decision to dissolve the Company due to its loss of equity; and (iv) Puentes' administrative complaint.133 The Respondent, on the other hand, asserts that the only reason it terminated the Contract was the dissolution of Puentes, which constituted grounds for automatic termination per Article 30.9 of the Concession Contract.134\n\n**Exhibit C-0051**, Resolution No. 1994/14, 29 August 2014.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 149.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 332.\n\n133.\n\nThe Termination Resolution also called for the drawing down of Puentes' performance bond and for Puentes to pay any outstanding fines. Argentina cashed the performance bond, which by then had a value of AR$ 1,385,320.\n\n134.\n\nAfter terminating the Concession Contract, Argentina granted the Concession to a new operator, Caminos del R\u00edo Uruguay, S.A.135 On 1 September 2014, Puentes formally handed over the Concession and in March 2016, Argentina increased the Concession's toll rate.136\n\n**Exhibit C-0237**, Resolution No. 2012/2014, 29 August 2014.\n\n**Exhibit C-0428**, Resolution No. 1114/2016, 4 August 2016.\n\n**IV. THE PARTIES' CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n135.\n\nThe Claimant seeks the following relief:\n\n*a. A declaration that Argentina violated the BIT and international law with respect to Salini Impregilo's investments;*\n\n*b. Compensation to Salini Impregilo for all damages that it has suffered, as set forth herein and as may be further developed and quantified in the course of this proceeding;*\n\n*c. All costs of this proceeding, including Salini Impregilo's attorneys' fees and expenses; and*\n\n*d.

LIABILITY**\n----------------\n\n137.\n\nThe Claimant relies on several provisions of the Treaty and alleges that, in particular, Argentina has violated (i) the FET standard (Article 2.2); (ii) the non-discrimination (MFN) standard (Articles 2.2 and 3); and (iii) the obligation not to unlawfully expropriate an investment (Article 5).\n\n138.\n\nThe Respondent contends that it has not breached any of its international obligations under the BIT and that, in any event, the defense of necessity would preclude wrongfulness of its acts.\n\n**A.

The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n139.\n\nThe Respondent posits that Webuild's claims raised in this arbitration are partly related to certain loans made by the Claimant to Puentes (\"**Webuild Shareholder Loans**\").139 According to the Respondent, to the extent such claims relate to those Shareholder Loans, they are inadmissible in light of the bidding documents' terms and the Concession Contract, which is part of the applicable law to the dispute. The Respondent contends that these documents and the Contract state that, once the subsidy was paid, Argentina had no further liability regarding financing. Consequently, claims to which Webuild may be entitled as creditor of Puentes are excluded, as already established by the tribunal in the *Hochtief* Arbitration.140\n\n*See* Table 3, Loans from Impregilo to PdL, Bambaci/Dellapiane First Report, \u00b6 101.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 355-363; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 335.\n\n140.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that it would be absurd to allow Webuild to bring claims against Argentina on account of the Webuild Shareholder Loans when the Claimant alleges that these Loans were made to cover part of Puentes' financial deficit caused by Puentes' and Webuild's failure to obtain financing.141\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 358.\n\n141.\n\nThe Respondent also contends that the claims asserted by the Claimant arising out of the Webuild Shareholder Loans are already being repaid in Puentes' reorganization proceedings. According to the Respondent, this would amount to a double recovery.142\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 364-366; Respondent's Rejoinder \u00b6\u00b6 370-373.\n\n142.\n\nLastly, Argentina contends that the tribunal in the *Hochtief* Arbitration interpreted Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract correctly when holding that Webuild's claims as lender to Puentes should be rejected.143\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 360-369.\n\n***b. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the Respondent's conclusion regarding Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract is incorrect, and that Section 3(j) of the Bidding Terms, which are binding, expressly provides that investment treaty rights (which in this case include Shareholder Loans) apply to investments in Puentes.144\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 158-164.\n\n144.\n\nIt further posits several reasons for its position that Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract does not bar claims under applicable investment treaties: (i) its text does not mention treaties or international law; (ii) its grammar and structure emphasize that it is limited only to certain kinds of claims; and (iii) such an interpretation would be harmonious with Section 3(j) of the Bidding Terms.145 The Claimant contests Argentina's allegation that Article 22.2 bars claims it has made based on the Webuild Shareholder Loans. It claims that the text as well as the structure of the provision indicate otherwise, and that the conduct of the Parties reinforces the interpretation that Article 22.2 was solely concerned with third-party financing.146\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 165-172.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 173-187.\n\n145.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, any waiver of treaty rights with respect to the Shareholder Loans would require compliance with the standards for waiver set out in Argentine and international law. Under the former, the waiver must be clear, unequivocal and specific. Waivers of rights are not presumed, and the interpretation of acts to prove any such waiver needs to be restrictive. Pursuant to the latter, a waiver of rights needs to be clear and unambiguous and a *jurisprudence constante* requires that waivers of jurisdiction or claims under an investment treaty may not be implied.147\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 194-208.\n\n146.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant submits that, despite Article 22.2 having freed Argentina from bearing commercial risks, the provision was not designed to force Webuild to accept the political risks underlying the Concession, including the risk that Argentina might engage in treaty-breaching conduct.148\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 191-192.\n\n147.\n\nRelating to the proceedings in the *Hochtief* Arbitration, the Claimant argues that the majority holding is unpersuasive and flawed in several ways: (i) inasmuch as the Parties did not present detailed arguments regarding the proper interpretation of Article 22.2, the majority was not able to fully consider its interpretation; (ii) the majority did not consider Section 3(j) of the Bidding Terms, which expressly reserve treaty protections for Puentes; (iii) it failed to consider other arguments regarding Article 22.2's scope; and (iv) it did not properly account for Article 22.2's historical and policy basis.149\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 209-219.\n\n148.\n\nLastly, regarding Argentina's contention that the Tribunal cannot admit Webuild's position because Argentina filed claims in Puentes' bankruptcy proceedings, the Claimant alleges that this Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction already confirmed the lack of any risk of double recovery.150\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 220.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n***a. Preliminary Observations***\n---------------------------------\n\n149.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal observes that the Respondent has not raised a jurisdictional objection with respect to the Webuild Shareholder Loans, only an admissibility issue.\n\n150.\n\nAs a result, the Respondent's inadmissibility argument regarding the Webuild Shareholder Loans is not grounded in the BIT, but in the provisions of the Concession, in particular Article 22.2 (to which the Tribunal will return in the discussion below). In this regard, the present Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in the *Hochtief* Arbitration when it ruled that: \"[j]urisdiction is an attribute of a tribunal and not of a claim, whereas admissibility is an attribute of a claim but not of a tribunal\"151 and \"[d]efects in admissibility can be waived or cured by acquiescence: defects in jurisdiction cannot.\"152\n\n**CL-0011**, *Hochtief AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Decision on Jurisdiction, 24 October 2011(\"***Hochtief*****, Decision on Jurisdiction**\"), \u00b6 90.\n\n**CL-0011**, *Hochtief*, Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 95.\n\n151.\n\nIn the present case, because the Respondent has only raised an admissibility issue regarding the Webuild Shareholder Loans, the Tribunal still has to assess its jurisdiction *proprio motu* as well as the admissibility of the claims themselves.\n\n152.\n\nArticle 1.1 of the BIT stipulates that:153\n\n*El t\u00e9rmino 'inversi\u00f3n' designa, de conformidad con el ordenamiento jur\u00eddico del pa\u00eds receptor e independientemente de la forma jur\u00eddica elegida o de cualquier otro ordenamiento jur\u00eddico de conexi\u00f3n, todo aporte o bien invertido o reinvertido por personas f\u00edsicas o jur\u00eddicas de una Parte Contratante en el territorio de la otra, de acuerdo a las leyes y reglamentos de esta \u00faltima. En este marco general, son considerados en particular como inversiones, aunque no en forma exclusiva: [\u2026]*\n\n*d) cr\u00e9ditos directamente vinculados a una inversi\u00f3n, regularmente contra\u00eddos y documentados seg\u00fan las disposiciones vigente en el pa\u00eds donde esa inversi\u00f3n sea realizada.*\n\nIn its unofficial English translation:\n\n*'Investment' means, in accordance with the host country laws and regardless of the selected legal form or any other connected law, any contribution invested or reinvested by an individual or a legal entity of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Party, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the latter. Within this general framework, it includes in particular, though not exclusively: [\u2026]*\n\n*d) claims of money directly related to an investment, properly executed and evidenced in accordance with the laws in force in the country where such investment is made.*\n\nThe official languages of the BIT are Spanish and Italian. Given that the official languages of this Decision are Spanish and English, this Decision only refers to the official Spanish version and the unofficial English translation.\n\n153.\n\nOn the basis of this Article, including the specific reference to \"loans\" in paragraph d), it would seem *prima facie* that the claims based on the Webuild Shareholder Loans are covered by this Tribunal's scope of jurisdiction. It remains for the Tribunal to consider, however, the meaning and role of the 'in accordance with laws and regulations' language of the BIT, both in the *chapeau* of this Article, where it is referenced not once but twice, and again in subparagraph d), dealing specifically with loans, where it modifies the language \"properly executed and documented\".\n\n154.\n\nInasmuch as these references qualify the terms \"investments\" and \"loans\", they operate to limit the universe of what the BIT can recognize as an investment, to the extent of their scope. In this manner, the term 'in accordance with laws and regulations' can be seen to function as a local law portal through which investments must pass in order to qualify for protection under the BIT. The question is what the parameters of that portal (or in this case, portals) are.\n\n155.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted that these provisions function as a legality clause.154 And indeed, the Tribunal is aware that a number of tribunals have treated language of this type (*i.e.*, 'in accordance with law' language) as creating a legality requirement, that would not just encompass investment formalities (indeed, some have argued that the illegality must be substantial and would exclude minor violations), but would preclude, for example, corrupt or fraudulent investments.\n\n*See*, e.g., Claimant's closing argument, Tr. Day 10: 1338-1342.\n\n156.\n\nThis BIT is more complex, however. Its multiple and slightly diverse references to an \"in accordance with law\" requirement, as referenced above, require the Tribunal to consider whether the multiple references are intended to have the same or different meanings. The Respondent did not submit any arguments that materially advance the interpretation on this basis; instead, the Respondent's submissions are focused on the Concession Contract.\n\n157.\n\nThe Tribunal's analysis begins with the clause in subsection d) of Article 1.1 of the BIT on loans. This clause appears to the Tribunal, on a textual analysis, to be the clearest of the three references regarding its scope and function. The language \"properly executed and documented\" modifies the \"in accordance with\" language. The use of the specific terms \"executed and documented\", coupled with \"properly\", indicate to the Tribunal that this clause is concerned with the formalities required by Argentine law for loans to be properly entered into. This clause, therefore, appears to state a formalities requirement for investments taking the form of loans; for loans (such as the Shareholder Loans) made in Argentina, its legal requirements regarding such formalities would be controlling.\n\n158.\n\nThis leaves the question about the meaning of the two references to \"in accordance with\" in the *chapeau* to Article 1.1 of the BIT. The *chapeau* is of course more general and structured so as to encompass a variety of legal forms of investment. Standard canons of construction would suggest that distinct meanings should be found for all of its language, even if repetitive, to avoid surplusage. But it is difficult to discern any distinct meaning for the two \"in accordance with\" references in the *chapeau*. In its second iteration in the *chapeau*, the 'in accordance with' language explicitly modifies \"invested\" (\"any kind of contribution or asset invested\u2026in accordance with the laws and regulations\u2026\"). The *chapeau*'s first iteration of \"in accordance with\", although a separate clause in the original Spanish as well as the translation, only makes sense if it is also read to modify 'invested'. Although such a reading would arguably make this clause redundant, otherwise it becomes simply a floating clause that modifies nothing, which makes no sense whatsoever. Both clauses seem to emphasize the primacy of the laws and regulations of the country that receives the investment; indeed, the first clause emphasizes the need for conformity with the laws of the host country notwithstanding the legal form of the investment or the presence of \"any other connected law\".155\n\nAlthough the first reference in the *chapeau* uses the prepositional phrase (in the Spanish) \"*de conformidad con\" [\"conformemente\"* in the Italian version]*,* while the second uses \"*de acuerdo a\" [\"in conformita alle\"* in the Italian version]*,* these different phrases hardly suggest a distinct meaning. Indeed, both are translated as \"in accordance with\" in the unofficial English version.\n\n159.\n\nThus, both clauses in the *chapeau* are focused on the need for the investment's compliance with the laws of the host country. The Tribunal cannot discern any different meaning for the two clauses. However, again from a textual reading, it is not clear they are aimed, as the loan-specific provision in d) seems to be, at formalities. The absence of any formalities-focused language in the *chapeau*, in contrast to that in d), suggests to the Tribunal that a different meaning should be given to those terms. To invest them with content that is distinct from that in subsection d), the loan-specific provision, the Tribunal considers that, at least for investments taking the form of loans, the BIT may incorporate both a legality requirement (by virtue of the *chapeau*'s two references) under Argentine law, and a formalities requirement (by virtue of subsection d)) that is based, in this case, on Argentine law.156\n\nThis approach is in keeping with the governing law of the BIT, Article 8.7 of which provides \"*El tribunal arbitral decidir\u00e1 sobre la base del derecho de la Parte Contratante parte en la controversia \u2013incluyendo las normas de esta \u00faltima relativas a conflictos de leyes--, las disposiciones del presente Acuerdo, los t\u00e9rminos de eventuales acuerdos particulares concluidos con relaci\u00f3n a la inversi\u00f3n, como as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n los principios de derecho internacional en la materia*.\" In the unofficial English translation: \"*The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute \u2014includes its rules on conflict of laws\u2014, the provisions of this Agreement, the terms of any possible specific agreement concluded in relation to the investment as well as with the applicable principles of international law*.\"\n\n160.\n\nNo evidence has been put before the Tribunal either of illegality or of improper formalities in connection with the Webuild Shareholder Loans. If there were, then presumably the Respondent would have put forward such evidence and argued that these Loans were not within the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Respondent made a number of jurisdictional arguments, but not this particular argument. Moreover, if there were issues in connection with the propriety of the manner in which any of the Shareholder Loans were entered into or with their legality, it seems highly likely that the Argentine court seized with the Puentes reorganization proceeding would have so found. But it did not; indeed, the evidence is that the court admitted the Shareholder Loans, providing further strong evidence of their proper form and legality.157\n\nTr. Day 2: 236:6-15; Tr. Day 2: 247:2-15; Tr. Day 10: 1340:20-22; Tr. Day 10: 1341:1-14.\n\n161.\n\nIn sum, even giving wide effect to the \"in accordance with laws\" portals in Article 1.1 requiring consideration of the requirements of Argentine law and regulations, there is no indication that the Webuild Shareholder Loan claims do not meet the requirements of Article 1.1(d) of the BIT by virtue of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract or otherwise. They must therefore constitute \"investments\" under the BIT and there would appear to be no jurisdictional bar to those claims.\n\n***b. Admissibility***\n----------------------\n\n162.\n\nThe issue of admissibility of the Webuild Shareholder Loan claims turns on the interpretation of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract. This provision stipulates that:\n\n*Los pr\u00e9stamos que contraiga el Postulante Ganador y la Concesionaria, seg\u00fan corresponda, para la financiaci\u00f3n de la construcci\u00f3n, mantenimiento y explotaci\u00f3n de las obras no gozar\u00e1n de ninguna garant\u00eda del Concedente, ni los financistas podr\u00e1n efectuar reclamaci\u00f3n alguna contra el mismo ni contra las Provincias, lo que se har\u00e1 constar en los convenios respectivos. [emphasis added]*\n\nIn its unofficial English translation:\n\n*Loans entered into by the Successful Bidder and Concessionaire, as the case may be, to finance the construction, maintenance and operation of the project shall not be secured by the Grantor, nor shall the lenders be entitled to any claim against the Grantor or the Provinces, all of which shall be indicated in the relevant agreements. [emphasis added]*\n\n163.\n\nThe Parties' respective arguments with respect to this provision have been summarized earlier.158 Whether this clause should be interpreted as an exclusion of any claims based on Shareholder Loans, or a waiver by the Claimant of any rights to pursue BIT claims based on such Loans, is a matter of contract interpretation and the application of the governing law in relation to the Concession Contract. Accordingly, the resolution of these particular questions requires the application of Argentine law.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 139-148 *supra*.\n\n164.\n\nBoth Parties made extensive submissions on the Argentine law they considered to be relevant to this issue, including expert opinions\u2014Dr. Liendo for the Claimant and Mr. Comadira for the Respondent\u2014and testimony at the Hearing on the Merits. The Tribunal has given careful consideration to their testimony and sought to reconcile the divergent views (set out in detail below) they expressed on particular points of importance.\n\n165.\n\nThe Tribunal has organized its consideration according to the following sub-topics which have been the object of submissions by the Parties: first, the textual and contextual analysis of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract; second, the relevance of the Bidding Terms, and particularly Section 3(j), to the interpretation of Article 22.2; third, the standards for waiver if Article 22.2 is to be construed as containing a waiver of BIT rights; fourth, the question whether the scope of Article 22.2 extends to political as well as commercial risks or is limited to commercial risks; and finally, the persuasive value of the *Hochtief* tribunal's analysis of this issue.\n\n166.\n\nAs will be explained below, the Tribunal concludes that Article 22.2 does not operate to exclude or waive claims based on loans that qualify as investments under the BIT, as these Shareholder Loans do.\n\n(i) Textual and contextual analysis of the scope of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n167.\n\nArticle 22.2 of the Concession Contract, quoted earlier, contains two restrictive clauses on its face: the first prevents the successful bidder or concessionaire from securing any loans entered into to finance the construction, maintenance and operation of the project with the Grantor [*i.e*., Argentina]; the second prevents \"lenders\" from having any claim against either \"the Grantor or the Provinces\". It also requires that such restrictions be indicated in the \"relevant agreements\".\n\n168.\n\nIt is the interpretation of the second restrictive clause that concerns the Tribunal here. In particular, the question is whether this clause covers third-party project financing loans only, as the Claimant contends, or also covers the Webuild Shareholder Loans, as the Respondent contends. According to the Claimant's expert, Dr. Liendo, the purpose of Article 22.2 is \"[t]o specify that the Republic was not contractually liable to the Concessionaire's lenders\",159 describing the absence of a surety contract under which \"one of the parties secures a third party's debt and the third party's creditor accepts that ancillary obligation\".160 Moreover, \"given the experience in previous years and the absence of prior concessions for the construction and operation of highways awarded in bidding processes without Treasury guarantees, the Republic deemed it necessary to warn and inform potential bidders that these processes would be different from all bidding processes previously held in the country\".161\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 53.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 56.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 59. The Tribunal notes that Dr. Liendo has served as a public official in the Argentine Government from 1991 to 1996 and appears to have personal knowledge of and experience with Argentine Government policies in this regard.\n\n169.\n\nDr. Liendo maintained that the private funding of large infrastructure works *without Treasury guarantees* was only possible if the economic rules that had eliminated structural inflation, restored public credit, and adopted adequate rules of risk distribution between the public and private sectors were upheld. Or, alternatively, such a result could be possible if the State had committed to \"'restoring the Agreement to its original condition' existing prior to any '[g]overnment action defined as such by laws, decrees or any other provisions issued by any government body [...] affecting the financing, studies, construction or operation of the Concession.'\"162 As a result, \"the Republic's liability arises from the fact that it prevented Puentes from using the revenues collected from the concession on the terms and conditions set forth in the Contract due to acts and omissions exclusively attributable to the [State]\".163\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 65.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 68.\n\n170.\n\nThe Respondent's expert, Mr. Comadira, does not address this point. His expert opinion focused on the legal framework in which Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract operates. He considers the Concession Contract to be an administrative contract. Under his submissions, the Argentine law governing administrative contracts is an \"exorbitant\" legal system, defined as residual or by exclusion of private law, composed of substantive and procedural prerogatives of the Government, balanced against guarantees of private persons.164 Supported by an analysis of Argentine Supreme Court jurisprudence, Mr. Comadira argued that an \"administrative contract\" is a meeting of the minds generating subjective legal situations, in which one of the intervening parties is a Government entity, whose subject-matter comprises a public purpose or a purpose inherent to the Administration, and contains explicitly or implicitly, exorbitant clauses of private law.165\n\nComadira Report, \u00b6 25-28.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 29.\n\n171.\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Comadira engaged in a discussion of general principles governing administrative contracts: the principle of mutability and administrative *ius variandi*,166 the continuity principle,167 the power of direction and control,168 the power of imposing penalties,169 the revocation for reasons of opportunity, merits or convenience,170 annulment due to illegitimacy,171 and an act of God or *force majeure* and breaches of the contractor.172 He also set out the interpretation of Bidding Terms and conditions, whereby the latter constitute the law of the bid or the contract specifying the purpose of the procurement and the rights and duties of the bidders and the awardee. These are to be interpreted restrictively to safeguard equality of participants, and, in case of doubt, the interpretation has to go against the private person and in favor of the State (and is even more stringent if the contractor has technical and legal skills).173 In his view, the interpretation of administrative concession contracts is to be construed restrictively: \"nothing is to be taken as conceded but what is given in unmistakable terms, or by an implication equally clear\".174 The principle of equality in bidding processes is projected into the contract which has to be consistent with applicable bidding terms and conditions: there can be no modifications unless to address objective needs of public interest.175 Finally, Mr. Comadira discussed the administration's power to impose penalties: whether, upon occurrence of an event that is a ground for termination of the contract, such decision is a duty of the administration or at its discretion. He put forward that, in case of dissolution or liquidation of the company, it must be the former, otherwise the personal liability of officials might be engaged.176\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 39-42.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 43-54.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 55-56.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 57-63.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 64-69.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 70-72.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 73-75.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 76-83.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 84-92.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 92-97.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 98-113 referring to Puentes \u2013 Article 30.9, second paragraph of the Contract.\n\n172.\n\nBased on this interpretive approach, Mr. Comadira considered that the second restrictive clause of Article 22.2 had to be taken at face value as an unqualified and unlimited restriction that applied to any project lender, whether or not a shareholder, and to conclude otherwise would violate the governing principle of restrictive interpretation in favor of the State.177\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 186-194.\n\n173.\n\nDr. Liendo disagreed with Mr. Comadira's analysis of the application of the restrictive principle to this specific provision. During the Hearing, Dr. Liendo specifically disagreed with the interpretation by Mr. Comadira of the Argentine Supreme Court's jurisprudence on a principle put forth by the U.S. Supreme Court that \"nothing is to be taken as conceded but what is given in unmistakable terms or by an implication equally clear.\" In accordance with such a principle, any affirmation must be shown: \"[s]ilence is negation, and doubt is fatal to the Concessionaire's right.\"178 Dr. Liendo argued that:\n\n*[t]his statement only refers to those instances in the Concession Agreement where privileges and licenses and rights are granted to the Concessionaire. Precisely, because in the Concession Agreement, we have a private party exercising public functions. So, the scope of the powers granted to a third party that's going to cooperate with the administration needs to be quite restricted.*179\n\nHowever, he continued,\n\n*when we look at Article 22.2, we do not see that 22.2 includes any kind of franchises, privileges, or rights to the Concessionaire. To the very contrary, Argentina made it clear in that contractual provision that no guarantee had been given to a third party under that contract--that is to say, the lender of the Concessionaire.*180\n\nHearing: Response to Mr. Comadira on administrative principles (Tr. Day 6: 750:16-18).\n\n*Ibid*., pp. 750:21-751:6.\n\n*Ibid*., pp. 751:7-13.\n\n174.\n\nWhen questioned further on this point, Dr. Liendo responded that when the right of the private person \"does not arise from the Concession but, rather, from its own property rights which are guaranteed in our system by the national constitution, it doesn't require that it be given in concession by the Administration. It is its own right.\"181 In these cases, he maintained, there is no need for a restrictive interpretation of the Contract in favor of the Grantor and against the Concessionaire, but rather the opposite. The interpretation would be favorable to the property right holder, whose rights can only be impaired by statutory provisions, *i.e.,* provisions adopted by Congress imposing restrictions on property rights.\n\nTr. Day 6: 824:1-4; 824:7-831:18.\n\n175.\n\nAccording to Dr. Liendo, when there is a question of a waiver of rights, as is presented by the second restrictive provision of Article 22.2, the interpretation should not be in favor of the Grantor but rather in favor of the Concessionaire. To support this argument, he referred to the *Edenor* case.182 Edenor is a company that distributes electricity in Buenos Aires under a Public Services Concession. In connection with the renegotiations after the adoption of the Emergency Law, an Agreement was reached in which the State waived collecting fines for breaches prior to a given date. Edenor had engaged in conduct that would have attracted sanctions after the date of the Agreement but before its ratification by the Executive Branch. The company argued that the Agreement would not be applicable until such time as it was ratified by the Executive, so it considered that these breaches, which were the basis for the Grantor to impose fines, were exempted from payment. The Court held that the waiver on the part of the State (not to collect fines) should be interpreted restrictively, finding that the waiver corresponded to the period after the Agreement had been concluded, even if it had not been ratified. It was understood that the Parties had taken into account those acts that would be the motive for sanctions that existed at the time that the Renegotiation Agreement was entered into. In other words, the Court adopted a restrictive approach to interpreting the waiver.\n\n*See also* Liendo report, \u00b6 41.\n\n176.\n\nAs a result, Dr. Liendo concluded that the parameters for when interpretation should be restrictive are clear: when the granting of a public power, a franchise or a concession of privileges is concerned, the interpretation should be restrictive in favor of the Grantor. But when the exercise of property rights is concerned, the interpretation should be favorable to the holder of the property rights, unless the opposite has been agreed upon in a clear, unequivocal, and express manner.\n\n177.\n\nMr. Comadira disagreed with Dr. Liendo on this point, saying that while some cases he referred to, did involve privileges, others were simple administrative contracts.183\n\nTr. Day 7, 856:13-21.\n\n178.\n\nDr. Liendo further argued that Article 22.2 should be construed as referring solely to third-party loans, not shareholder loans: \"the Argentine State's interest in specifying that it was not a guarantor of said loans and that, therefore, those agreements were *res inter alios acta* with respect to it are addressed to third-parties to the contractual relationship between the Republic, the Successful Bidders and the Concessionaire, because, clearly, Article 22.2 was agreed upon by them and, therefore, both parties already knew what they had stipulated.\"184 Moreover, \"it is inconsistent with the structure of the Contract to consider that the provisions on third-party financing contemplate a limitation on the Grantor's liability to the Successful Bidder and the Concessionaire, which are matters addressed elsewhere in the Contract.\"185\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 75.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 79.\n\n179.\n\nFurthermore, according to Dr. Liendo, \"acts of God and force majeure events are regulated in Article 31 of the Contract, setting forth the Grantor's obligation to restore any conditions that may be affected by acts of government if, on account of their magnitude, they 'alter the economic-financial balance' of the Contract, expressly mentioning the item 'financing' among those subject to disturbance and restoration, together with studies, construction, and operation.\"186 In his view, \"[t]he Contract clearly states, specifically in Articles 22.1, 22.3, and 22.4, that the Successful Bidders and the Concessionaire were responsible for dealing with the funding of the portion of the work under their charge, either by means of third-party financing or through self-financing.\"187\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 81.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 82.\n\n180.\n\nMr. Comadira again disagreed with Dr. Liendo, particularly insofar as the scope of the terms 'lenders' and 'claims' in Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract is concerned. In his view, Article 22.2:\n\n*reflects the clear objective of restricting the liability of Grantor to the payment of the subsidy agreed-upon, thus releasing it from any liability to anyone who grants loans to Concessionaire. Accordingly, the risks of such financing agreements lie on the borrower, exclusively -whether it is the Successful Bidder or Concessionaire. For the purposes of this article, it is irrelevant who has extended the loan, since irrespective of who the lender is, Grantor does not assume any obligations towards the lender.*188\n\nCiting Argentine court decisions on the interpretation of administrative contracts, he put forward that any exception extending the rights of the Concessionaire, or its shareholders would be \"contrary to the hermeneutics of administrative contracts.\"189\n\nComadira Report, \u00b6 189.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 191.\n\n181.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Comadira argued that \"[i]f Claimant's position regarding article 22.2 were accepted, *i.e*., if it were accepted that such article is not applicable to loans granted by Concessionaire's shareholders, the possibility of extending Grantor's liability would be in the hands of Concessionaire and its shareholders exclusively, to the extent that the limitation of liability expressly contemplated in such article could be rendered ineffective and the risks of financing would be transferred to Grantor.\"190 He is of the opinion that \"Article 22.2 is clear and categorical when it bars any claim (\"any claim\") by lenders against Grantor and the Provinces involved, and such a restriction should be expressly indicated in the agreements \u2013an obligation that, as stated in the preceding paragraphs, was imposed on the Successful Bidder or Concessionaire exclusively, in their capacity as borrowers.\"191\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 192.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 199.\n\n182.\n\nFinally,\n\n*[w]hile article 7 and related provisions set forth the obligations and responsibilities towards Concessionaire, article 22.2 refers to the position assumed towards lenders. When the Concessionaire's shareholders assume the role of Concessionaire's lenders, they deliberately agree to abide by the provisions of article 22.2, knowing that such article restricts the risks and responsibility assumed by Grantor.*192\n\nAs a result,\n\n*[t]he limitation of the Government's liability under the terms of article 22.2 should be expressly stated by the borrower in the loan agreement, as expressly provided for in such article. It is clear that the failure to indicate expressly such a restriction in the loan agreements executed between Concessionaire and the Claimant cannot remove the limitation of liability of the Government. Even more so in the case of a loan agreement executed by Concessionaire and its own shareholder. If this possibility was accepted, it would have been sufficient that Concessionaire failed to include such clause in all the loan agreements executed to render the provisions of article 22.2 of the Contract ineffective.*193\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 201.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 202.\n\n183.\n\nWith regard to financing, Dr. Liendo argued that Article 31.2 of the Concession Contract was relevant to the issue as this provision recognizes the Concessionaire's right to restoration of the economic and financial equation of the Concession if it is affected by acts of government \"directly or indirectly affecting the financing, studies, construction or operation of the Concession,\" highlighting in particular the explicit reference to financing in this clause.194 He argued that the Parties' subsequent actions confirm his interpretation, whereby he referred to the LOUs and Transitory Agreements whose investment plan updates included both equity and debt as part of the re-establishment of the equilibrium as required by Article 31.2.195\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6\u00b6 43-44.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6\u00b6 47-51.\n\n184.\n\nAt the Hearing on the Merits, Mr. Comadira disagreed with this position, saying that financing under Article 31.2 of the Concession Contract is different from financing under Article 22.2.196\n\nTr. Day 7: 944:19-949:3.\n\n(ii) Consideration of the role of the Bidding Terms\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n185.\n\nIn considering the scope of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract, the Parties' submissions, including expert submissions, discussed the relevance of the Bidding Terms.\n\n186.\n\nSection 3(j) of the Bidding Terms deals with BIT rights:\n\n*In the cases contemplated by the relevant rules, the investment promotion and protection arrangements entered into by the ARGENTINE REPUBLIC shall be applicable.*\n\n187.\n\nBoth the Claimant and the Respondent used *lex specialis* to support their respective positions on the role of the Bidding Terms in the construction of Article 22.2. The Claimant argued in its written submissions that the Bidding Terms are more specific and therefore should prevail over the Concession Contract.197 Equally, at the Hearing on the Merits, the Claimant submitted that the Bidding Terms provision is more specific because it deals with investment treaties and contains no exceptions for debt.198 The Respondent, on the other hand, argued in its written submissions that the Concession Contract provision is specific in dealing with loan claims and therefore should prevail over the Bidding Terms.199\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 171.\n\nClaimant's Opening Statement, slides 212-213.\n\nRespondent's, Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 343 et seq.\n\n188.\n\nThe question is whether there is a hierarchy between the Bidding Terms and the Contract provisions. At the Hearing on the Merits, the Claimant cited to Article 2 of the Concession Contract, under which, it asserted, the Bidding Terms prevail in the event of a conflict between the Bidding Terms and the provisions of the Concession Contract.200 But the Claimant also argued that the Terms can be interpreted harmoniously if Article 22.2 is read as being limited to third-party lenders. This is also supported by Dr. Liendo when he states that \"a contextual and harmonic interpretation of the documents that make up the Contract,\" *i.e.* including the Bidding Terms in accordance with Section 2 (applicable provisions and documents) of Annex 1 to the Concession Contract, which \"allows us to conclude that Article 22.2 [\u2026] would only apply to the action or right arising from the loan agreement signed by the lender and the Concessionaire, but this does not preclude, limit, or exclude the right to invoke the BIT's protection if that 'investment' is affected by the host State.\"201 For this reason, he continues, \"interpreting Article 22.2 of the Contract calls for a harmonization that gives all other contract provisions value and meaning and, to that effect, we must especially consider what the BIT provides regarding the scope of the protection it accords to investments by nationals of the Treaty's signatory States.\"202\n\nClaimant's Opening Statement, slides 212-213.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 45.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 46.\n\n189.\n\nIn other words, Dr. Liendo would seem to regard the Bidding Terms as part of the Contract, so any conflict between the Bidding Terms and the main terms of the Contract would be a conflict between two contractual clauses. In such event, \"the appropriate interpretation of those provisions must give value and meaning to all of them, making sure that no provision annuls or hinders the effects of the other(s).\"203\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 44.\n\n190.\n\nNeither the Respondent, nor its expert, Mr. Comadira, seem to explicitly deny or confirm the existence of a hierarchy between the Bidding Terms and the Contract provisions. Mr. Comadira emphasises that the Bidding Terms as well as the Concession Contract itself must all be construed restrictively, and in case of doubt, interpreted against the concessionaires, to safeguard the principle of equality as applied in the Argentine legal system.204\n\nComadira Report, \u00b6\u00b6 83 and 92.\n\n(iii) Waiver arguments\n----------------------\n\n191.\n\nIn addition to making arguments regarding the scope of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract and the Bidding Terms, the Claimant, relying on its Argentine law expert, made a waiver argument: namely, that if Article 22.2 were construed as applying to the Webuild Shareholder Loans and therefore excluding claims made on the basis of such Loans, it did not contain a valid waiver of rights to make claims involving investments protected by the BIT.\n\n192.\n\nIn his Report, Dr. Liendo stated that under both Argentine and international law, waivers of rights of actions must be clear, unequivocal and specific, because they cannot be presumed \"and the interpretation of acts in order to prove any such waiver shall be restrictive.\"205 Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract, he argued, does not contain such a waiver. However, even if a clear, unequivocal, and specific waiver were to exist, \"it should not run counter to other provisions of the Contract under which the treaty right or action considered waived is upheld.\"206 He also submitted that, \"[i]n the event of a conflict between two or more contract clauses, the appropriate interpretation of those provisions must give value and meaning to all of them, making sure that no provision annuls or hinders the effects of the other(s).\"207\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 41, citing Exhibit HL-02.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 42.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 44.\n\n193.\n\nPursuant to Section 874 of the Argentine Civil Code, which was in force when the events took place, \"[t]he intention to waive cannot be presumed, and the interpretation of acts in order to prove any such waiver shall be restrictive, pursuant to Section 874 of the Civil Code.\"208 According to Dr. Liendo, the Argentine Supreme Court reiterated this principle in several decisions.209\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 94 (referring to Exhibit HL-02).\n\n*Ibid*., see fn. 9.\n\n194.\n\nDr. Liendo emphasised the need to give value and meaning to all contract provisions, making sure that no provision annuls or hinders the effects of the others.210 In his view, Article 22.2 is a clause that only addresses the effects of the absence of safeguards by the State in favor of the Concessionaire's creditors \"without even contemplating the potential lenders' nationality [\u2026] and, thus, neither that article nor any other provision of the Contract includes a direct, indirect, or implied reference to a waiver of the protection accorded by the BIT.\"211 The generic reference to \"any claim\" contained in that contract provision should be read as an exclusive reference to claims arising from \"[l]oans entered into by the Successful Bidder and Concessionaire,\" not the other claims which the Successful Bidder or the Concessionaire may bring against the Grantor for any other reason.212\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 44.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 39.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 40.\n\n195.\n\nMr. Comadira addressed this issue indirectly in his Report through his position on the interpretation of administrative contract provisions (discussed above).213 When asked about the waiver argument during the Hearing, he explained that such waiver may not be presumed in private law but, referring to his arguments regarding administrative contracts, this was different in public law: if the right is clear and unequivocal, no waiver can be considered.214 Mr. Comadira did seem to concede that none of cases he cited discussed the issue of waivers, but he sought to distinguish between State waivers (not presumed) and waivers by private persons on the basis of Section 874 of the Civil Code jurisprudence.\n\nComadira Report, \u00b6\u00b6 195-204 (meaning of \"claim\").\n\nTr. Day 7: 956:4-966:2.\n\n196.\n\nThe arguments of the Respondent's expert, Mr. Comadira, thus appeared to seek to dismiss the waiver issue more than address it, by focusing on the narrow interpretation of concession contracts instead of the reconciliation of the Bidding Terms and the Contract.215 Mr. Comadira's report does not appear to deal with the effect of the Bidding Terms beyond generalities, arguing that the Bidding Terms should be interpreted restrictively to protect the equality of bidders and the public interest. However, at the Hearing, he appeared to agree that contract provisions should be interpreted harmoniously and that there is a relationship of subordination between the Concession Contract and the Bidding Terms.216\n\nComadira Report, \u00b6\u00b6 76-83.\n\nTr. Day 7: 942:11-943:5.\n\n(iv) Commercial versus political risks\n--------------------------------------\n\n197.\n\nFinally, the Parties' respective experts discussed the issue of whether Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract should be interpreted as negating claims against the State based on both commercial and political risks, or only commercial risks.\n\n198.\n\nDr. Liendo maintained that there are two types of actions to which the Claimant is entitled in relation to the Webuild Shareholder Loans: (i) contractual performance actions arising from the loan agreements it signed with the Concessionaire; and (ii) actions arising from the Republic's failure to comply with its obligations under the BIT. The former can only be brought against the Concessionaire; the latter can only be brought against the State because it granted the rights to collect tolls during the Concession, which it then altered without restoring the economic and financial balance of the Contract, which it ultimately terminated.217 None of these rights, he submitted, were waived in Article 22.2 of the Contract and, therefore, that Article does not preclude taking into account, for the purposes of compensation, all of the invested assets or contributions, irrespective of the legal form chosen to make the investment.218 Each individual or legal entity has only one personality, which is why the splitting of the investor entailed by the *Hochtief* tribunal's interpretation is inappropriate.219\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 100 referring to Exhibit HL-15, Bielsa, Rafael, Derecho Administrativo*,* Vol. II, page 1121, published by Thomson Reuters LA LEY, 7th Edition updated by Roberto Luqui, Buenos Aires, 2017; Exhibit HL-14, Marienhoff, Miguel, Tratado de Derecho Administrativo*,* Vol. III-A, page 363, published by Abeledo Perrot, Buenos Aires, October 2011.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 106.\n\nLiendo Report, \u00b6 109. In Dr. Liendo's view, compensation has to include all of its constituting elements, and it is inadmissible to subordinate the foregoing to the personality of the Claimant, *i.e.*, whether it is acting in its capacity as successful bidder, concessionaire, shareholder, or lender. *See also* Liendo Report, \u00b6 112.\n\n199.\n\nMr. Comadira was of the opinion that Article 22.2 completes the definition of the obligations and responsibilities assumed by Grantor: financing is a commercial risk.220 In his analysis, however, he did not discuss the equilibrium provisions (Contract Art. 31.2 or the Emergency Law). He considered that under Article 9, the State has the power but not the obligation to renegotiate.221\n\nComadira Report, \u00b6\u00b6 206-212.\n\nTr. Day 7: 859:12-860:5.\n\n(v) The Tribunal's preliminary analysis\n---------------------------------------\n\n200.\n\nGiven that the Parties' respective expert's conclusions are based on fundamentally different points of departure\u2014for Mr. Comadira, the position that Shareholder Loans are categorially excluded flows directly from the principle of restrictive interpretation of administrative contracts, while for Dr. Liendo, the principle has no application to this particular issue but is instead an issue of proper construction of the Concession Contract and the application of waiver principles to the rights at issue--the Tribunal has been faced with diverging positions that are difficult to reconcile. After detailed consideration, however, the Tribunal has concluded that Dr. Liendo's view on the scope of Article 22.2 is the more persuasive. Despite the fact that Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract is written in broad terms and does not include any exceptions, it makes sense in the overall context to read Article 22.2 as precluding any recourse to the State for commercial claims based on loans by third Parties entered into for project-financing purposes, but not any BIT-qualifying claims. In the Tribunal's view, this is the better view even without consideration of the Bidding Terms, but becomes an even stronger conclusion if the Bidding Terms are taken into account.\n\n201.\n\nThe first clause of Article 22.2 essentially stipulates that the State will not provide any security for any loans. The Tribunal agrees with Dr. Liendo that when viewed in context this clause seems implicitly to assume a third-party lender. The second clause, by starting with 'nor', would seem to be expressing a similar concept but adding that even with unsecured loans, the Successful Bidder and Concessionaire (*i.e.*, the consortium members originally, and later Puentes as assignee) have an obligation to ensure that the loan agreements entered into with third parties contain non-sovereign-recourse provisions. The use of the term 'lenders' in the second clause, in contrast to the use of the term 'Successful Bidder and Concessionaire' in the first, also suggests dealings with third parties and not shareholder-lenders, as Dr. Liendo submits.\n\n202.\n\nWith regard to the Bidding Terms, it appears to the Tribunal that Article 2 of the Concession Contract, stipulating that the Bidding Terms *\"rigen este Contrato\",* establishes that the Bidding Terms dictate the scope of the Contract. \"*Regir*\" in Spanish means to govern or rule, indicating a superior hierarchical position.222 Given the terms of the BIT, as noted earlier, the Webuild Shareholder Loans qualify as covered \"investments\" and can therefore be the subject of claims, unless excluded or waived. If Article 22.2 were to be read to constitute a waiver of such claims, it would not only violate waiver principles that seem not to be in serious dispute between the Parties' experts, but would also create a conflict between the Bidding Terms and the Contract. While the Tribunal is satisfied that the Respondent did not intend to provide a sovereign guarantee of the project financing, both the Bidding Terms and the equilibrium provisions of the Contract require a different conclusion with respect to political risk.223\n\n\"To govern (sth.) (over so. / sth.); to reign; to rule; to dominate\", Leo Online Dictionary: https://dict.leo.org/spanish-english/regir.\n\nThe Tribunal is of the view that the Respondent's argument that once a subsidy has been paid, the State does not bear any further financing liability, conflates the distinction between commercial and political risk.\n\n203.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that even though Article 22.2 may not be as clear and unequivocal as the Claimant has argued, following the principle of harmonious interpretation, which both experts appear to agree is part of Argentine law, and taking into account the other submissions of the Parties and their experts regarding the interpretation of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract in its full context, the better view is that while it may exclude third-party loan claims, it does not exclude claims that qualify as \"investments\" under the relevant BIT, whether they take the form of shares or loans.\n\n204.\n\nArgentina's criticism of Webuild for providing support to the Concessionaire in the form of loans rather than additional equity contributions does not advance its case. As the Tribunal understands it, the winning bidder was required to invest a certain level of equity in Puentes and the Consortium did so. There was no requirement that additional contributions take the form of equity rather than debt. Had Webuild invested additional equity in Puentes, over the apparent objections or unwillingness of the minority shareholders to make further contributions, presumably with the result that the minority shareholders would have been diluted, its resultant increased equity stake would be subject to recovery in these proceedings in the same way as its 26% equity stake. But its additional investments took the form of debt instead. The issue here is not that the Webuild Shareholder Loans were impermissibly granted, or should have taken the form of equity, but whether they can be admitted as claims in these proceedings or are precluded by Article 22.2.\n\n(iv) Limited persuasive value of the *Hochtief* decision\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe Tribunal turns finally to the decision of the tribunal in the *Hochtief* Arbitration in relation to claims based on the Webuild Shareholder Loans, which the Tribunal finds upon close examination has limited persuasive value in this case, notwithstanding the parallel posture (albeit in the context of a different treaty) of the two cases in relation to this issue.\n\n206.\n\nThe *Hochtief* tribunal's decision (by majority) relied heavily on the language of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract and its lack of any exception for BIT claims to hold that claims based on the Hochtief Shareholder Loans were precluded by the terms of Article 22.2.224 The tribunal did not, however, engage in a detailed textual or contextual analysis to reach that conclusion,225 although it did note that \"other sections of the Concession Contract, such as Sections 11.1 and 11.3, do expressly provide for the position of third parties\".226 However, Article 11 does not deal with financing, but essentially makes the Concessionaire liable for its management of the Concession properties and execution of the work, including for damage it causes to third parties. Its references to third parties, using different terminology, are therefore not particularly probative.\n\n**CL-0013,** *Hochtief*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6 194.\n\n*Ibid*., *see Hochtief*, Decision on Liability, (Annex A) \u00b6\u00b6 187-194 for full discussion.\n\n**CL-0013,** *Hochtief,* Decision on Liability, fn 184. Both of these provisions are part of *Article 11, Responsabilidades).* Article 11.1 states that*:* \"*La Concesionaria ser\u00e1 responsable, ante el Concedente y terceros por todos los actos que por s\u00ed o por intermedio de contratistas y subcontratistas ejecute para la correcta administraci\u00f3n de los bienes afectados a la concesi\u00f3n, y por todas las obligaciones y riesgos inherentes a su adquisici\u00f3n, construcci\u00f3n, operaci\u00f3n, administraci\u00f3n y mantenimiento. Asimismo la Concesionaria ser\u00e1 civilmente responsable por los perjuicios o da\u00f1os que pueda ocasionar a personas o bienes. Ella, su personal y las empresas con las que contrate trabajos ser\u00e1n responsables, adem\u00e1s, por el cumplimiento de todas las leyes, ordenanzas y disposiciones emanadas de las autoridades con jurisdicci\u00f3n en la zona de la obra.\"*Article 11.3, second paragraph, states that \"(...) *Deber\u00e1 hacerse cargo, asimismo, de las acciones que surgieren por da\u00f1os causados a terceros o a sus bienes, como consecuencia en ambos casos del obrar de la Concesionaria o de las responsabilidades que le son propias en su car\u00e1cter de concesionaria de una obra p\u00fablica (\u2026)*.\"\n\n207.\n\nThe *Hochtief* tribunal did not consider the more relevant provisions of Article 31 of the Contract, and the fact that the equilibrium provisions both there and under the Emergency Law appear to include financing matters and debt within their scope.\n\n208.\n\nNor did the *Hochtief* tribunal reference Section 3(j) of the Bidding Terms, or discuss its implications for the interpretation of Article 22.2, in its analysis of the issue, as the Claimant in the present case has noted. Indeed, the *Hochtief* Decision on Liability states that \"[n]either the Concession Contract nor the BIT contains any provision that expressly nullifies Article 22.2 or subordinates it to the protections afforded by the Treaty.\"227 This ignores Section 3(j) of the Bidding Terms as well as Article 2 of the Concession Contract which make the Bidding Terms (among others) governing of the Concession Contract.\n\n**CL-0013,** *Hochtief*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6 192.\n\n209.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal that the limited treatment of the issue of the Hochtief Shareholder Loan claims' admissibility by the *Hochtief* tribunal may be a function of the fact that the parties in the *Hochtief* Arbitration did not focus on it in detail. The *Hochtief* Decision on Liability does not contain any citations to parties' submissions in this regard, except in para. 187, where the tribunal cites the Respondent's objection. Nor did the *Hochtief* tribunal appear to have the benefit of the type of detailed expert opinions on Argentine law that have been submitted in this case.228\n\nThe *Hochtief* tribunal's decision on the Shareholder Loan claims was an issue raised in the Application for Annulment of the Claimant; however, those proceedings were terminated based on an apparent settlement reached by the parties prior to any decision on the Application. On 9 August 2021, the ICSID *ad hoc* Committee issued a procedural order taking note of the discontinuance of the proceeding pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 43(1). *See also \u00b6* 49 *supra* (reflecting notification to this Tribunal of the discontinuance).\n\n210.\n\nOverall, therefore, the limited extent of the submissions and analysis concerning the admissibility of Hochtief Shareholder Loan claims does not materially assist this Tribunal in reaching a decision on the Shareholder Loan claims before it. This significantly undercuts the persuasive value of the *Hochtief* decision for the present Tribunal. While consistency is an important value in these types of proceedings, this Tribunal must consider the totality of the submissions before it in this case, including the detailed expert opinions on Argentine law, and reach its decision based on its analysis of those submissions. Having concluded that the tribunal's decision in the *Hochtief* Arbitration has limited persuasive value for the present Tribunal, likely due to the scarce record available to it, the Tribunal affirms its considered decision that the Webuild Shareholder Loan claims are admissible.\n\n(vii) Conclusion and Implications for Damages\n---------------------------------------------\n\n211.\n\nHaving considered in depth the submissions of the Parties and their experts on the proper interpretation of Article 22.2 of the Concession Contract, including the relevance of the *Hochtief* tribunal's decision, the Tribunal has determined that the claims of Webuild predicated on its Shareholder Loans are admissible. The Respondent's request that the Tribunal declare these claims inadmissible is therefore denied. While this determination means that Webuild Shareholder Loans will be part of any damages calculation should any of the Claimant's merits claim succeed, how precisely they should be factored into that calculation is a question that will require further consideration under that scenario. The Tribunal is mindful of the need to avoid double recovery, as well as the potential need to address other issues that might affect the proper calculation of damages. This may include, for example, in the event this Tribunal finds a violation on the merits, a determination of the extent to which the failure timely to reestablish the Concession Contract's equilibrium prevented the repayment of the Webuild Shareholder Loans.229\n\nAs the Claimant's expert Dr. Liendo opined, the scope of the compensation as regards the intercompany loans would therefore be \"*limited to the portion that was not paid by the Concessionaire [\u2026] due to the disruption of the concession's economic and financial equation*.\" Liendo Report, \u00b6 71.\n\n**B. Fair and Equitable Treatment**\n-----------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n(1) The Standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment\n------------------------------------------------\n\n212.\n\nThe Claimant submits that under the FET standard included in Article 2.2 of the BIT, Argentina has a positive obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to covered investments and a negative obligation to refrain from unjustified or discriminatory treatment. Therefore, according to the Claimant, unjustified or discriminatory treatment breaches the FET standard, but the Government's conduct can also violate the FET standard without being unjustified or discriminatory.230\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 178-180.\n\n213.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the following actions are comprised under the FET standard: (i) actions that frustrate an investor's legitimate expectations in relation to its investments; (ii) actions that treat an investor or an investment with a lack of transparency; (iii) conduct that creates an unstable and unpredictable legal framework or business environment for the investment; (iv) conduct that violates due process or results in a denial of justice including \u2013 but not limited to \u2013 improper judicial or administrative proceedings as well as governmental interference in such proceedings; (v) discriminatory actions; and (vi) actions taken in bad faith.231\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 184 and the extensive case law cited therein: **CL-0013**, *Hochtief v.

Puentes' right, it posits, is protected by the right to property embodied in the Argentine Constitution, which cannot be altered by Argentina without fair compensation.233\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 186.\n\n216.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that even though Puentes did assume some risks in connection with the Concession Contract, it did not assume potential risks generated by the Government's conduct. This was reflected in the Concession Contract, which entitled Puentes to request a review and the restoration of the economic equilibrium if negatively affected by Argentina's conduct. The Claimant contends that it was therefore reasonable for Puentes to expect Argentina to restore the Concession's economic equilibrium and provide compensation for the negative impact of Argentina's conduct.234\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 187-188.\n\n217.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, the Emergency Law created an economic imbalance by causing the conversion of the toll rates from US$ 7.40 to AR$ 7.40 and their freezing until the finalization of the renegotiation process. The Claimant argues that the need to restore the Concession's equilibrium was acknowledged by Argentina through the Emergency Law, which provided that public contracts would be renegotiated by the State within a period of 180 days. Argentina's acknowledgment of the Emergency Law's negative impact on the Concession's economic equilibrium was further expressed in the LOUs and the transitory agreements.235\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 189-191.\n\n218.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Puentes waited for over ten years for Argentina to restore the economic equilibrium \u2013 to no avail. Argentina did not ratify either the LOUs or the transitory agreements. The Claimant further contends that the execution of these instruments would not even have restored the Concession's economic equilibrium, but they would have provided a first important step, enabling Puentes to repay its debts to Argentina and other lenders and ultimately, once complete renegotiation had occurred, would have restored the internal rate of return contemplated in the LOUs and the transitory agreements.236\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 197.\n\n219.\n\nThe Claimant emphasizes that Argentina also caused the Claimant to expect that it would comply with the terms of the Financial Assistance Loan. Since no other third-party funding was available and due to Argentina's warning either to accept the FAL or abandon the investment, the Claimant argues that it had no other choice but to accept the Financial Assistance Loan, notwithstanding its onerous terms.237\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 198.\n\n220.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that it relied on Argentina's contractual commitments when it contributed an additional US$ 3,439,390.37 to finish Project construction. Arguably, these types of commitments have been viewed by tribunals as the most likely to create legitimate investor expectations that the State will conduct itself in a certain manner. For example, the arbitral tribunal in *Total v. Argentina* held that specific legal obligations assumed by the host State in contracts, concessions or stabilization clauses create a legitimate expectation upon which the investor is entitled to rely as a matter of law.238\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 199.\n\n221.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, Argentina's issuance of Resolution 14 unilaterally modified the terms of the Financial Assistance Loan, thereby changing Puentes' finances and destroying its ability to pay back the Financial Assistance Loan or earn any profit.239\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 200.\n\n(iii) Argentina's Conduct Was Arbitrary, Grossly Unfair, Unjust and Idiosyncratic\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n222.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Argentina's conduct, consisting of (i) its failure to renegotiate the Concession Contract, and (ii) its termination of the Concession, was arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust and idiosyncratic.240 The Claimant does not, however, challenge the legality of the Emergency Law *per se*.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 202, 207.\n\n223.\n\nThe Claimant highlights that past tribunals have found that Argentina's failure to restore the economic balance after the enactment of the Emergency Law breached the FET standard (*e.g.*, *Impregilo v. Argentina* and *EDF International v. Argentina*). It further underscores that the delay in concluding the renegotiation process within a reasonable time was held by the *Hochtief* tribunal to be a breach of the FET standard since it crossed a line between what was merely sub-optimal administration and bureaucratic delay, and what became a failure to remedy the adverse consequences of Argentina's measures that was so prolonged and so complete as to infringe the investor's rights under the BIT. The Claimant further notes that the *Hochtief* tribunal also held that Argentina's failure to implement any of the LOUs and transitory agreements was unfair to Puentes.241\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 203-204.\n\n224.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Argentina's unfair and inequitable treatment is comprised of the following acts: (i) it presented a renegotiation proposal in April 2005, more than three years after the enactment of the Emergency Law, which provided 180 days for the renegotiation of public contracts; (ii) it repudiated the First LOU by unilaterally replacing it with the Second LOU; (iii) it denounced the Second LOU based on a claim by one of Puentes' subcontractors 'in spite of the fact that Argentina was already well-aware of that claim prior to proposing the Second [LOU] and that the resolution of the subcontractor's claim depended on the successful renegotiation of the Concession Contract'; (iv) it represented to Puentes that a transitory agreement rather than a letter of understanding would allow the agreement to be ratified more quickly, although it ultimately failed to implement any of the four agreements subsequently executed; (v) it represented to Puentes that a transitory agreement would not require a public hearing for its ratification (after Puentes agreed to two transitory agreements, Argentina claimed that a public hearing needed to be held nevertheless); and (vi) it forced Puentes into dissolution by failing to ratify the Fourth Transitory Agreement and by preventing Puentes' shareholders from injecting more capital into the company to prevent its dissolution.242\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 205.\n\n225.\n\nThese actions, in the Claimant's view, demonstrate Argentina's continued delay in the negotiations with Puentes. Additionally, the Claimant posits that Argentina violated its own legally-imposed deadlines, made unreasonable excuses for its failure to execute, convinced Puentes to accede to terms promising benefits that were never delivered, and withheld approvals that would have prevented Puentes' dissolution.243 In the words of Puentes' CFO, Mr. Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez: \"Resolution SOP 14/03 and the Emergency Law financially asphyxiated the company.\"244\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 206.\n\n**CWS-0003**, Witness Statement of Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez, 27 Dec. 2016, \u00b6 35.\n\n226.\n\nLastly, the Claimant alleges that Argentina wrongfully terminated the Concession Contract citing Puentes' dissolution as a ground for termination, despite the fact that Argentina had blocked Puentes' shareholders from approving a capital injection to avoid dissolving the company. In the Claimant's view, each ground for termination alleged by Argentina is equally absurd and arbitrary.245\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 207.\n\n(iv) The *Jurisprudence Constante*\n----------------------------------\n\n227.\n\nThe Claimant notes that several other arbitral tribunals have concluded that Argentina's failure to renegotiate public contracts disrupted by the emergency measures violated the FET standard. The Claimant emphasizes that while there is no rule of *stare decisis* in international investment law, it has been held that a series of cases that resolve a particular issue in the same manner can \u2013 and should \u2013 operate as an influential guide to subsequent tribunals addressing the same issue.246\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 208-209; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 227.\n\n228.\n\nThe Claimant highlights that several investment tribunals have held that Argentina breached the FET standard with its pesification measures and abrogation of inflation-protection clauses. The Claimant notes that every tribunal addressing this issue has found that Argentina breached the FET standard when failing to renegotiate the public concessions negatively affected by the Emergency Law, thereby failing to restore the contracts' economic equilibrium after the end of the economic crisis.247\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 210; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 225.\n\n229.\n\nThe Claimant posits that, in accordance with this *jurisprudence constante*, absent very compelling circumstances, this Tribunal should find that Argentina's failure to renegotiate Puentes' Concession and to restore its economic equilibrium constitutes a breach of the FET standard.248\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 212.\n\n(v) Argentina's FET Arguments Are Incorrect\n-------------------------------------------\n\n230.\n\nThe Claimant makes various responses to Argentina's FET arguments. First, contrary to the Respondent's contention, the Claimant argues that it did not breach the Concession Contract from the very beginning. In its view, the financial issues Puentes faced arose from a range of factors, such as (i) the looming Argentine economic crisis, (ii) Argentina's repeatedly late payment of the agreed subsidy amounts, (iii) the IDB's and banks' withdrawal in response to both these factors, and (iv) the Emergency Law. The Claimant argues that, in any event, its alleged non-compliance would be irrelevant to the question whether Argentina had to re-establish the Contract's economic equilibrium and whether it did so in fact.249\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 232-234.\n\n231.\n\nSecond, the Claimant argues that Argentina's alleged measures to support the Project are neither correct nor relevant. In any event, far more consequential than any role Argentina played in the IDB negotiations was its failure to pay the subsidy on time, its pesification and its failure to re-establish the Concession's economic equilibrium. According to the Claimant, Argentina's financial assistance to Puentes was an abusive money-making venture for the State.250\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 235-238, 256-259.\n\n232.\n\nThird, Argentina's argument that the economic equilibrium was disrupted before the enactment of the Emergency Law is, in the Claimant's view, solely based on the fact that the IDB refused to disburse the Loan because of expectations that traffic volume would be reduced. The Claimant submits that the IDB negotiations were affected by several factors, such as Argentina's failure to pay the subsidy in a timely manner. It further contends that there are reasons to believe that the IDB would have disbursed the Loan, had Argentina met its contractual obligations.251\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 239-242.\n\n233.\n\nFourth, the Claimant argues that whether Puentes owed Boskalis-Ballast or not, Puentes could not pay its subcontractors without Argentina having restored the Concession's economic equilibrium. Arguably, the tribunal in the *Boskalis-Ballast* ICC Arbitration explicitly recognized that the uncorrected imbalance created by Argentina's pesification put Boskalis-Ballast and Puentes in difficult economic circumstances.252\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 243-247.\n\n234.\n\nFifth, the Claimant notes that Argentina's reliance on the findings of the *Hochtief* tribunal that Puentes was in financial difficulties is irrelevant. It stresses that, in any event, the *Hochtief* tribunal was wrong in its assessment of why and to what degree Puentes was experiencing financial challenges before the Argentine economic crisis.253\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 248-251.\n\n235.\n\nSixth, Argentina's position that renegotiating the Concession Contract would have contravened the principle of equality among bidders fails to consider that Argentina had committed itself to rebalancing the Concession Contract if its conduct disrupted the Concession's economic balance. If the Consortium and the other concessionaires would have known during the bidding process that Argentina would refuse to rebalance their contracts' equilibrium, they would have either not participated or submitted a different bid. Accordingly, the principle of equality supports the reestablishment of the equilibrium.254\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 252-255.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n236.\n\nThe Respondent posits that the FET standard, coinciding with the minimum standard of treatment, does not provide an absolute guarantee of legal stability or an insurance policy, as confirmed by the *Hochtief* tribunal. A broad interpretation of the standard that would protect the investor's expectations is nowhere to be found: not in the Italy-Argentina BIT, nor in any other BIT concluded by Argentina.255\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 389; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 389-390.\n\n237.\n\nThe Respondent emphasizes that due regard has to be given to the context and circumstances of the case at hand, in particular that: (i) the Project was approved under the public works concession regime; (ii) it was stated in the Concession Contract that Puentes would not receive sureties or guarantee from Argentina and that the Concession would not have any guaranteed minimum revenues or traffic volume; and (iii) the Concession Contract was a risk contract as per Decree No. 650/1997.256\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 394-397; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 398-399.\n\n238.\n\nThe Respondent further contends that Puentes did not manage to obtain financing for the Project from the very outset for reasons not attributable to Argentina, being the fact that the obligation to submit the FIFA was of essence to the Contract. Argentina claims that, despite Puentes' failure, Argentina still disbursed the subsidy, maintained the Concession and granted Puentes financial aid, thereby bearing the burden of the risk assumed by Puentes. The Respondent notes that, while Argentina could have terminated the Concession Contract, it opted for maintaining it.257\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 398-403; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 393-396, 401-403.\n\n239.\n\nArgentina alleges that regard should also be given to the measures it adopted to support the Project. Among others, it granted repeated extensions for Puentes to comply with its obligation to submit the FIFA, negotiated with the IDB and supported Puentes in its efforts to obtain financing; it also granted Puentes financial aid at a time when Argentina was facing an unprecedented economic, financial, social, political and institutional crisis, and maintained the Concession despite Puentes' multiple breaches.258\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 404; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 412-414, 424, 448.\n\n240.\n\nThe Respondent argues that Puentes itself recognized that the economic and financial equilibrium of the Concession Contract was disrupted before the Emergency Law was enacted.259 Arguably, Puentes' financial problems arose prior to the crisis, as demonstrated by the ICC arbitration proceedings commenced by its subcontractor Boskalis-Ballast. According to Argentina, the *Hochtief* tribunal also noted that there was evidence that Puentes was in financial difficulties even before pesification. This shows that the disequilibrium alleged by the Claimant occurred before the emergency measures and is solely attributable to the Claimant.260\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 405-407; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 420-423; 426-428.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 408-414; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 429-434.\n\n241.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent posits that the Claimant's contention that Argentina's failure to rebalance the Concession forced Puentes into reorganization proceedings is false. The Respondent asserts that Puentes' insolvency proceedings were caused by the bankruptcy claim brought by its subcontractor Boskalis-Ballast to secure the ICC Arbitration award rendered in its favor.261\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 434-437; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 434.\n\n242.\n\nArgentina emphasizes that the disruption of the economic equilibrium of the Contract due to Puentes' financial difficulties before the adoption of the emergency measures made it difficult to renegotiate the Concession and, at the same time, meet the goal of protecting the public interest and the principle of equality among bidders, both of which the State must ensure.262\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 415; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 443-445.\n\n243.\n\nThe Respondent further claims that the *Hochtief* tribunal did not actually find that the pesification policy as such breached the FET standard. It further contends that a lack of adjustment of tariffs does not in itself amount to treatment that is contrary to the FET standard but rather must be assessed in light of all circumstances of the case.263\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 418-419; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 447.\n\n244.\n\nThe Respondent contends that Puentes falsely claims that it was forced to sign the Financial Assistance Loan Agreement and that Argentina unilaterally changed the terms of the Agreement through Resolution 14. Puentes was free to accept or reject the FAL Agreement and it could even terminate it if Puentes obtained more convenient financing sources.264 Further, in Argentina's view, Resolution 14 did not increase the interest rate.265\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 421-422; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 438, 449.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 434-436; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 457, 459-461.\n\n245.\n\nFurther, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to consider that: (i) Puentes was not providing public services at the time the renegotiation commenced; (ii) other concessionaires showed themselves to be collaborative, which allowed negotiations to be concluded well ahead of the Agreement entered into with Puentes; and (iii) Argentina continued with the renegotiation process, even after being warned by the subcontractors that the adoption of any measures should be subject to the prior regularization of Puentes' situation with its subcontractors and suppliers.266\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 438-440; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 463.\n\n246.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the need to establish a common line between the renegotiation process and Puentes' insolvency proceedings rendered the terms of the Second LOU ineffective, and a new agreement needed to be reached consistent with the new situation.267\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 441; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 471.\n\n247.\n\nAccording to Argentina, the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings is one of the grounds for termination of the Concession Contract, with the same effects and scope as in the event of termination through the fault of the Concessionaire. The Respondent emphasizes that, nonetheless, Argentina did not terminate the Concession and continued to seek a solution, even once Hochtief initiated its ICSID arbitration. This is acknowledged by the Claimant itself.268\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 443-444; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 473.\n\n248.\n\nThe Respondent contends that the Claimant's reliance on the transitory agreements to support its argument that Argentina purportedly violated the FET standard is contradictory. If the LOUs and the transitory agreements created obligations for Argentina, that means that the renegotiation was successful and, therefore, it is not possible to invoke a breach of the BIT on this basis. On the contrary, if the LOUs and the transitory agreements did not result in an effective agreement between the Parties, it cannot be argued that they created obligations for Argentina. The Respondent submits that Puentes itself denounced the Fourth (and last) Transitory Agreement, thereby abandoning the renegotiation process of the Contract. It was also Puentes that filed an administrative claim requesting that the Concession Contract be declared terminated on the basis of Argentina's fault. Puentes further filed a complaint in court.269\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 445-447; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 474-476.\n\n249.\n\nWith respect to the Claimant's argument relating to Puentes' request for a capital increase, the Respondent alleges that such purported request was in fact intended to *decrease* the equity set out in the Contract from AR$ 30 million to AR$ 1 million. In the Respondent's view, said amount was insufficient to attain the corporate purpose and inconsistent with the Contract's obligation regarding the level of equity funding.270\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 448-451.\n\n250.\n\nLastly, the Respondent submits that the Claimant incorrectly cites the grounds that justified Argentina's termination of the Concession Contract. Article 1 of the Termination Resolution declared the termination of the Concession Contract by reason of the Concessionaire's dissolution and liquidation. Termination was thus automatically triggered by the decision of Puentes' shareholders to dissolve the company, and was not based on the grounds alleged by the Claimant. In the Respondent's view, termination of a contract, carried out in accordance with its terms, does not amount *per se* to a violation of the standards set forth in the applicable BIT.271\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 452-460; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 480-484.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n251.\n\nAt the outset, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that, under the applicable FET standard, Argentina has a positive obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to covered investments, in accordance with investors' legitimate expectations, and a negative obligation consisting of refraining from unjustified or discriminatory treatment.\n\n252.\n\nThe positive obligation incorporated in the FET standard is included in Article 2.2 (first sentence) of the BIT: '*Cada Parte Contratante acordar\u00e1 siempre un trato equitativo y justo a las inversiones de inversores de la otra. Parte Contratante [\u2026]*'. In the unofficial English translation: '*Each Contracting Party shall always accord a fair and equitable treatment to the investments made by the investors of the other Contracting Party. [\u2026]'*\n\n253.\n\nThe negative obligation incorporated in the FET standard is included in Article 2.2 (second sentence) of the BIT: '*[\u2026] Cada Parte Contratante se abstendr\u00e1 de adoptar medidas injustificadas o discriminatorias que afecten la gesti\u00f3n, el mantenimiento, el goce, la transformaci\u00f3n, la cesaci\u00f3n y la liquidaci\u00f3n de las inversiones realizadas en su territorio por los inversores de la otra Parte Contratante*'. In the unofficial English translation: *'[\u2026] Neither Party shall impair by unjustified or discriminatory measures, the management, maintenance, enjoyment, transformation, cessation, or disposal of investments*'.\n\n(i) Positive obligation under the FET standard\n----------------------------------------------\n\n254.\n\nThe applicable BIT does not restrict the positive obligation to accord FET to the minimum standard under customary international law, but allows for the broader range of treatment provided through autonomous treaty practice, comprising of \"a variety of distinct components\".272 The Claimant cites *Waste Management II* with approval on this point:\n\n*[F]air and equitable treatment is infringed by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process .... In applying this standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the claimant.*273\n\nClaimant Memorial, \u00b6 183.\n\n**CL-0027**, *Waste Management II* \u00b6 98.\n\n255.\n\nThis Tribunal would, however, like to emphasize that *Waste Management II* is a NAFTA Chapter Eleven case, and given the precise formulation of NAFTA Article 1105, its tribunal had to consider the facts from a customary law point of view \u2013 unlike the present Tribunal. Regardless of whether the customary standard has developed to the same extent (a point on which the present Tribunal does not wish or need to take a position), as argued by the Claimant and summarized above,274 FET as an autonomous treaty standard protects, at its core, the reasonable legitimate expectations of an investor vis-\u00e0-vis the State's conduct in relation to its investment. This standard has been elaborated upon at length in the case law, including in *Impregilo, Hochtief, National Grid, Total, EDFI and SAUR, BG and LG&E,*275 giving rise to a *jurisprudence constante*. Even though these cases were decided on the basis of different BITs, the relevant treaties all contain identical or similarly worded FET clauses.276\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 212-235 *supra*.\n\n**CL-0003**, *Impregilo* Award \u00b6 331; **CL-0013**, *Hochtief,* Decision on Liability \u00b6 281; **CL-0015**, *National Grid P.L.C. v.

The Republic of Argentina,* UNCITRAL Arbitration, Final Award, 24 Dec. 2007, \u00b6 309; **CL-0008**, *LG&E*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6 137.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 373-393; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 377-392.\n\n256.\n\nAs to the positive obligation to accord FET in the present case, the primary legitimate expectation of the Claimant was grounded in the Concession Contract itself: while this Contract may not create any expectation of a particular rate of return or profitability, it establishes the foundation for other expectations, including the expectations of a certain economic environment based on the existence of the Convertibility Law and the indexing of values, as well as the specific expectation that the economic equilibrium of the contract would be maintained (Article 31.2 of the Concession Contract). Such an expectation is particularly relevant for long-term commitments by foreign investors in sectors such as infrastructure which are capital-intensive and risk-laden.\n\n257.\n\nThe revenue side of the equilibrium equation was fundamentally altered by the Emergency Law through the creation of an economic imbalance by causing the conversion of the toll rates from US$ 7.40 to AR$ 7.40 and their freezing until the finalization of the renegotiation process.277 The Emergency Law recognized the need to restore the Concession's equilibrium by providing (in its Article 9) that public contracts would be renegotiated by the State within a period of 180 days, but this provision was not complied with by the State. The purpose of such renegotiation would not be the improvement of any company's position, but merely the restoration of the equilibrium. Article 9 incorporates an obligation of conduct which, when coupled with the promises of restoration of the economic equilibrium as a matter of local law, creates a legitimate and reasonable expectation of result.\n\nThe evidence before the Tribunal indicates that the cost side of the equation was also adversely affected by the Emergency Law and subsequent acts and omissions (Resolution 14, the failure to renegotiate the Concession Contract and restore its economic equilibrium, the failure to approve Puentes' request to increase its capital so as to comply with Argentine corporate law and avoid dissolution, and the Termination Resolution). These measures exacerbated the effects of the de-pegging of the peso to the U.S. Dollar and of de-indexation, and contributed to the ultimate failure of Puentes.\n\n258.\n\nAn additional persuasive element in this regard is the Argentine Commercial Court Judgment of 11 June 2008, holding that UNIREN's failure to continue renegotiation (after the 2007 LOU) was in breach of Argentine law, and expressing its concern that more than six years after enactment of the Emergency Law 'the grave imbalance in terms of the agreement persists'.278\n\n**Exhibit C-0040**, Court Order in Puentes del Litoral S.A. s/insolvency proceedings, File No. 093971, Court 13, Sec. 26, 11 June 2008.\n\n259.\n\nExplicit and specific representations were made by the State through both the renegotiation clause in the Emergency Law, providing that equilibrium would be restored within a reasonable time frame, and the obligations under Article 31.2 of the Concession Contract. The investor clearly relied on these provisions when returning to the negotiation table and signing the 2006 LOU, indicating it was accepting the conditions. In other words, the Claimant's reasonable expectations that the Concession's economic equilibrium would be restored within a reasonable time if Governmental action (*e.g.,* tariff pesification under the Emergency Law) affected it negatively, were legitimate. By 2006, enough time had passed after the enactment of the Emergency Law in 2002 to support the conclusion that the State had had ample opportunity to conclude a successful renegotiation and implement its results accordingly. The fact that a number of other developments were ongoing and affecting the economic and political position of the Government is not relevant with regard to the impact of the Emergency Law. As a result, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent has acted in breach of Article 2.2 (first sentence) of the BIT when it failed in November 2006 to restore the economic equilibrium of the Contract.\n\n260.\n\nThe Tribunal, while troubled by several aspects of the 2003 Financial Assistance Loan (including Resolution 14), does not consider that it needs to determine whether this Loan represents a separate breach of FET. (The Tribunal notes that the Claimant does not appear to maintain this is the case, since its damages claim does not cover this time period.) The Tribunal does, however, consider that the terms on which the Financial Assistance Loan, as its terms were ultimately set by Resolution 14, was granted, had the effect of exacerbating the financially straitened situation of Puentes created by the Emergency Law, making the need for restoration of the equilibrium in a reasonable time even more compelling.279\n\nThis was not only a function of the interest rate, compounding provisions, and repayment terms, but also because of the operation of the expense pesification provisions.\n\n261.\n\nFinally, with respect to the Respondent's failure to approve the requested equity infusion in 2012, the Tribunal accepts that the failure to restore the economic equilibrium of the Concession within a reasonable time had the consequence that Puentes was necessarily driven into a state of insolvency over a period of time thereafter\u2014\"financial asphyxiation\", as it was termed by the Claimant, with the predictable effect on shareholders' equity. This act was therefore not an isolated contractual decision but part of the relevant course of conduct. It represented in effect the \"nail in the coffin\" for Puentes.\n\n262.\n\nThe Tribunal did not find the Respondent's legal arguments persuasive: reliance on the *NEER* standard does not justify the breach of the Claimant's legitimate expectations; nor does termination of the Concession Contract serve as a defense to liability under the BIT. The main element of the breach is the failure to rebalance and restore the equilibrium in 2006; the later termination of the Contract is irrelevant, given the Tribunal's finding that the insolvency of Puentes was a consequence of the breach.\n\n263.\n\nNeither was the Tribunal persuaded by the factual arguments of the Respondent: the status of the Project at the time of the Emergency Law is irrelevant given the Respondent's conduct and the fact that the Project was completed and operational at the time the breach occurred. The Claimant had indeed assumed risks with respect to commercial matters such as traffic volume and revenues but again, this is irrelevant in light of the Tribunal's basis for finding a breach on the part of the Respondent. The same analysis applies to the Claimant's alleged breach of its contractual undertakings regarding financing (failure to obtain third-party financing) during the construction phase and the measures taken by the Respondent to support the Project. (Argentina nevertheless still disbursed the subsidies, maintained the Concession and granted Puentes financial aid that enabled the Project to be completed.) These facts, and the acknowledged financial support provided by the Respondent in the form of the subsidy and the Financial Assistance Loan, do not alter the fact that the Concession Contract and the Emergency Law created an obligation of rebalancing which was violated.280\n\nAt most, they might have an effect on the terms of the new equilibrium, but this would be a matter for Argentine law. In so holding, the Tribunal is not taking the position that contractual breaches or other conduct by a concessionaire or other holder of a public contract are never relevant to a determination of whether FET has been violated, only that on the facts of this case, they do not defeat either the investor's legitimate expectations as to rebalancing or the ultimate conclusion of breach. The Tribunal appreciates that Argentina asserts that Puentes itself took the position that the Contract's equilibrium had been upset by late July 2001, when Puentes wrote to the government asking it to rebalance the Concession. *See* para. 86 *supra.* The Parties dispute whether this request was commercially motivated (Argentina's position) or the result of the changing economic circumstances of the country (the Claimant's position). It is not disputed that Argentina's economic position as a country began to deteriorate several years before the enactment of the Emergency Law in January 2002. It is not clear to the Tribunal what the precise mix of commercial and macroeconomic factors behind Puentes' request may have been, but in any event a need to make such a determination is obviated by subsequent events.\n\n264.\n\nEqually, the situation of Puentes with its subcontractors and suppliers and the filing of a petition for the commencement of insolvency proceedings are not considered decisive. While these factors may have complicated or prolonged the renegotiation process to some extent, they do not explain its extensive duration and ultimate failure. Had the Concession Contract been timely rebalanced, some of the events highlighted by Respondent may not even have occurred. The Tribunal's finding that the breach took place in 2006 obviates the need to address any subsequent issues from a liability standpoint.\n\n265.\n\nOn the contrary, Argentina behaved in an arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust and idiosyncratic manner in not renegotiating the Concession Contract within a reasonable time, *i.e.,* not presenting a renegotiation proposal after the 180-day deadline set out in the Emergency Law; unilaterally replacing the first LOU; denouncing the second LOU; making representations regarding the First Transitory Agreement; not ratifying the Fourth Transitory Agreement; and in preventing Puentes' shareholders from injecting more capital into the company to avoid its dissolution. Equally, the Respondent conducted itself in an unjust manner when terminating the Concession.\n\n266.\n\nThe Tribunal appreciates that Argentina has argued that termination was an automatic result of the Concessionaire's dissolution and liquidation. While the Contract may have technically permitted such an action, FET requires that the Tribunal consider the termination not in isolation, but in conjunction with the other facts and circumstances of this case. Viewed in light of the totality of the facts and circumstances, it is clear that the termination was the final consequence of the failure to rebalance and the prolonged period of disequilibrium in which Puentes tried to operate under the unsustainable yoke of frozen tariffs, the terms of the Financial Assistance Loan, and increasing costs. If Respondent's failure to approve the equity infusion was the nail in the coffin of the investment following the failure to timely renegotiate, the termination of the Contract was its burial.\n\n267.\n\nThe Tribunal does not accept Argentina's argument that if the LOUs and Transitory Agreements created obligations for Argentina, this means that the renegotiation was successful and, therefore, it is not possible to invoke a breach of the BIT. It is manifest that the renegotiation, despite multiple attempts over a period of years, was not successful. But the breach of FET stems from the obligation created by the Emergency Law and the Concession Contract to restore the economic equilibrium within a reasonable time. Although the Respondent implies that the Claimant, in contrast to other concessionaires, was not sufficiently cooperative, this has not been proven. The Claimant has demonstrated that it fully participated in the process and acquiesced in the various LOUs and Transitory Agreements in the hope and expectation that an agreement would be reached. The Respondent has not demonstrated any bad faith on the part of the Claimant. And while the history of this Concession might have introduced some complexities not present in other concessions, the extreme and unjustified duration of the renegotiation efforts leaves little doubt in the Tribunal's mind that the \"reasonable time\" standard for rebalancing was breached.\n\n(ii) Negative obligations under the FET standard\n------------------------------------------------\n\n268.\n\nThe Tribunal's determination that the positive obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment to the Claimant's investments specified by Article 2.2 (first sentence) was violated effectively establishes that the negative obligation set forth in the second sentence of that same Article has been violated, at least with respect to the \"unjustified\" prong of that negative obligation. As the foregoing analysis has indicated, the Respondent had an obligation to restore the Concession's equilibrium within a reasonable time in the wake of the 2002 Emergency Law, based on both the provisions of the Concession Contract and the Emergency Law itself. That did not occur. Instead, the Concessionaire was subjected to a protracted series of negotiations between 2006 and 2014 during which period of time its toll rates were frozen at 2002 levels and its financial viability increasingly undermined, culminating in its insolvency and the Concession Contract's termination. Neither the circumstances of Puentes or the Project during that period, nor Puentes' prior conduct, justified such treatment. While recognizing the financial and other support that the Respondent gave to Puentes and the Project at various times, that support did not justify the treatment they received, either. Accordingly, on the facts of this matter, the Tribunal finds that Article 2.2 (second sentence) has also been violated.\n\n269.\n\nAs a result, the Tribunal holds that the evidence presented before it supports a finding that the Claimant has been treated in an unfair, inequitable and unjustified manner, thereby acting in breach of Article 2.2 (first and second sentences) of the BIT.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal makes no findings at this juncture regarding the other \"limb\" of the second sentence of Article 2.2, discrimination, as that concept will be addressed in its various formulations in Articles 3, and 4 of the BIT in the following section.\n\n**C. Discriminatory Measures**\n------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n(i) The Content of the Prohibition of Discriminatory Treatment\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n271.\n\nIt should be noted at the outset that the Claimant's discrimination claim encompasses several provisions of the BIT which contain discrimination elements. It has approached this claim in an overarching way.\n\n272.\n\nThe Claimant contends that most tribunals and international authorities have interpreted the concept of discrimination as concerning (i) different treatment, (ii) between two appropriate comparators, (iii) that cannot be justified.281\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 217; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 266, 268-275.\n\n273.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, the first element is non-controversial. Thus, one must assess whether a State has subjected a covered investment to treatment less favorable than treatment accorded to others.282\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 217.\n\n274.\n\nThe second element, in the Claimant's view, consists of determining who are the appropriate persons as points of comparison and what subject matters fall within the concept of treatment. In terms of \"who\", the BIT's national treatment and most-favored-nation provisions (Articles 3.1 and 4) provide that covered investments may not receive less favorable treatment as compared to the investments of Argentine nationals and other foreigners. The Claimant contends that, with regard to the subject matter, Article 2.2 provides that States may not subject covered investments to discrimination with respect to nearly all of the investment's phases, and Article 3 states that the national treatment and most-favored-nation provisions apply to all matters governed by the BIT.283\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 218.\n\n275.\n\nRegarding the third requirement \u2013 whether the less favorable treatment is justified \u2013 the Claimant notes that arbitral tribunals have used the concept of \"like circumstances\" to address the question of whether there was any legitimate reason justifying the less favorable treatment.284\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 219-222.\n\n276.\n\nThe Claimant submits that while some arbitral tribunals have determined that investments that compete with each other are in \"like circumstances\", an investment treaty's prohibitions against discriminatory treatment should not be interpreted as being limited to different treatment between investments that compete since (i) nothing in the BIT suggests that competition should determine the scope of discriminatory treatment; and (ii) the object and purpose of investment law is distinct from trade law. While trade law is concerned with reciprocal exchange of market opportunities and preventing protectionism, investment law seeks to protect the economic value of investments from a host state's opportunistic behaviour.285\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 223-225.\n\n(ii) Argentina Subjected Puentes to Less Favorable Treatment than Other Road Concessions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n277.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Argentina refused to grant Puentes any toll rate increase for over 12 years, while, at the same time, it granted numerous and substantial toll increases to other toll road operators. According to the Claimant, between 2002 to 2013, Argentina granted toll rate increases to at least 12 road operators, namely (1) Autopistas Urbanas, S.A.; (2) AUSOL; (3) Grupo Concesionario del Oeste, S.A.; (4) AEC S.A.; (5) Caminos del R\u00edo Uruguay; (6) Concesionaria del Sur; (7) Consortium formed by Vial 3 and Emcovial; (8) Cincovial, S.A.; (9) Caminos de las Sierras (Z\u00e1rate-Brazo Largo Bridge); (10) AUFE S.A.C.; (11) ARSSA; and (12) Ra\u00fal Uranga \u2013 Carlos Sylvestre Begnis Tunnel.286\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 226-227.\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimant contends that, as compared to these 12 toll-road concessionaires, Puentes received less favorable treatment.287\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 228.\n\n(iii) Investments of Argentines and Other Foreign Nationals in Toll-Road Concessions as Elements of Comparison\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n279.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Argentine nationals and nationals of other countries owned the shares in the project companies that held the other toll-road concessions to which Argentina granted toll increases. Since the shares of those investors in those companies and the related interests in the toll-road concessions constitute investments of those Argentine and foreign investors, they constitute appropriate points of comparison.288\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 229-231.\n\n280.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, toll rate increases constitute an appropriate subject matter for purposes of \"treatment\" because they concern the use and operation of an investment, thereby falling within the ambit of the BIT.289\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 230.\n\n(iv) The Claimant's Investment in Puentes and the Investments of Argentine and Other Foreign Nationals in Other Road Concessions Are in \"Like Circumstances\"\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n281.\n\nThe Claimant's investment and the investments of Argentine and other foreign nationals in other road concessions are in \"like circumstances\": (i) they are in the same economic sector as Puentes; (ii) their rates were denominated in Dollars and linked to the U.S. Consumer Price Index (\"**CPI**\"); (iii) their concession contracts allocated risks such as construction costs, traffic volumes, financing and government measures in a similar fashion to the Concession; (iv) the Emergency Law also negatively affected those toll-road concessionaires; and (v) they equally participated in the renegotiation process.290\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 232.\n\n282.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, even if the term \"like circumstances\" were to be construed as being limited to investments in direct competition, Puentes was subjected to discriminatory treatment. Apart from the Project works, the only two means to travel between the Provinces of Entre R\u00edos, Santa Fe and Buenos Aires are the Z\u00e1rate-Brazo Largo bridge toll-road concession and the Ra\u00fal Uranga-Carlos Sylvestre Begnis tunnel. According to the Claimant, the concessionaires operating these two concessions received toll rate increases.291\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 233.\n\n283.\n\nThe fact that Puentes and Caminos del R\u00edo Uruguay were in \"like circumstances\" was also confirmed in the Claimant's view when Argentina, after terminating the Contract, awarded the Concession to Caminos del R\u00edo Uruguay. According to the Claimant, a few weeks later Argentina increased the toll rate for Rosario-Victoria bridge and roadway built by Puentes.292\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 234.\n\n284.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the Emergency Law further demonstrates that Puentes was in \"like circumstances\" with other toll-road concessionaries since that Law obligated Argentina to restore the economic equilibrium of all concessions it affected.293\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 235.\n\n285.\n\nLastly, the Claimant argues that the reasons put forward by Argentina to sustain that Puentes was not in \"like circumstances\", lack merit. UNIREN's May 2014 report asserted that Puentes' Concession was different because (i) the Contract provided that Argentina would provide a subsidy to finance the construction, (ii) the main bridge was not complete when the Emergency Law was enacted, and (iii) Argentina provided the Financial Assistance Loan to Puentes, enabling it to complete construction, after noting five aspects that the Concession had in common with the other toll-road concessions.294\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 236-237.\n\n286.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, UNIREN's decision to compare Puentes with other concessionaires proves that Puentes was in \"like circumstances\" with the other road-toll concessions that did receive toll-rate increases. The aspects that, according to Argentina, distinguished Puentes from the other concessionaires are incorrect and unreasonable. First, the subsidy did not change the fact that the Emergency Law made it impossible for Puentes to cover its costs with its toll revenue. Moreover, some of the other concessionaires received subsidies from a trust fund created in 2001 from a tax on diesel oil and with the aim of compensating toll-road concessionaires for the reduction in their income and the maintenance of their contracts' economic equilibrium.295 Second, according to the Claimant, the Emergency Law did not differentiate between concessions that had finished their works and those that were not yet operating at the time of its enactment. It applied to the Concession Contract in any case because it pesified and froze its toll rate. Further, Argentina invited Puentes to the March 2002 kick-off renegotiation meeting with the other affected concessionaires, and asked Puentes to explain how the Emergency Law had affected the Concession despite the Project being incomplete at that time.296 Third, in the Claimant's view, the Financial Assistance Loan was necessary because the Emergency Law had made it impossible to obtain third-party funding.297\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 238.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 239.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 239.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n(i) The Content of the Prohibition on Discriminatory Treatment\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nArgentina submits that, pursuant to Articles 2.2 and 3 of the BIT,298 discriminatory treatment exists when the different treatment: (i) is accorded on grounds of nationality; (ii) is less favorable than that accorded to other investors in like circumstances; (iii) is accorded with the intention to harm the foreign investor; (iv) causes actual injury to the foreign investor; and (v) lacks reasonable justification.\n\nArgentina's submissions treat the Claimant as arguing discrimination under Articles 2.2 and 3 of the BIT only, and do not address Article 4.\n\n(ii) Argentina Did Not Discriminate Against Webuild\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n288.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Emergency Law was non-discriminatory in nature as it was general in scope and affected all toll-road concessionaires. The Law established general rules applicable to all economic agents without including any unreasonable distinctions and without targeting any specific group of citizens or investors. Argentina contends that the Law pursued the protection of the economic public policy interests which had been threatened by the serious economic, financial, exchange rate, social, political and institutional crisis that Argentina was facing.299\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 471-476.\n\n289.\n\nArgentina emphasizes that the renegotiation process established by the Emergency Law was aimed at (i) assessing all contracts on an equal footing without conferring any privileges, (ii) weighing the level of commitment shown by each concessionaire in the performance of their contract prior to the outbreak of the crisis, and (iii) assessing the objective possibilities of reaching a reasonable solution of the basis of shared efforts between the concessionaire and Argentina, taking due account of the users' interests.300\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 477.\n\n290.\n\nThe Respondent posits that, contrary to the Claimant's allegation that Puentes was treated in a discriminatory manner because Argentina did not restore the Concession's economic equilibrium, the economic equilibrium was disrupted before the enactment of the Emergency Law and was caused by Puentes' own financing problems. According to the Respondent, Puentes' financial situation made it difficult to renegotiate the Concession Contract and, at the same time, meet the goal of protecting the public interest and the principle of equality among bidders.301\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 478-482.\n\n291.\n\nArgentina submits that, when determining whether a treatment is more or less favorable than another, such treatment must be assessed as a whole and not by referencing to only one specific aspect. In this regard, the measures adopted by Argentina to support the Project need to be considered. According to the Respondent, such measures included, among others, the grant of repeated extensions to allow Puentes to comply with its obligation to submit the FIFA, Argentina's negotiation with the IDB and support to help Puentes obtain financing, the grant of financial aid at the time when Argentina was facing its crisis, as well as its maintenance of the Concession despite Puentes having breached the Concession Contract several times.302\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 483-484.\n\n292.\n\nThe Respondent claims that Puentes' Concession presented certain features that distinguish it from other toll-road concessionaires, as stated by UNIREN in its Report of 28 May 2014.303 First, most of the works under the Concession were subsidized by Argentina. Contrary to the Claimant's contention, other concessionaires did not receive subsidies from a special trust created in 2001. Rather, the trust was created by Decree No. 976/01 for granting compensation to certain concessionaires of the national road network for the decrease in their revenues as a result of a reduction in the toll rates. Second, contrary to other toll-rate concessionaires, Puentes had not completed the main works when the Emergency Law was enacted. The Concession Contract was nonetheless referred to renegotiation. Third, completion and commissioning of the works under the Concession were only possible through Argentina's financial aid, a benefit which was not granted to other toll-road concessionaires or any other public works and services company.304\n\n**Exhibit C-0316**, Report issued by UNIREN, May 28, 2014, p. 5.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 485-490; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 497-502.\n\n293.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that, contrary to the Claimant's contention, the Financial Assistance Loan was necessary not because the Emergency Law made it impossible to acquire third-party funding, but rather because of Puentes' failure to obtain financing and the disruption of the Concession's economic equilibrium prior the enactment of the Emergency Law, and for reasons not attributable to Argentina.305\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 491; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 505.\n\n294.\n\nArgentina further argues that two additional events negatively affected the renegotiation process: (i) Puentes' insolvency proceedings, which had a major impact on the evolution of the renegotiation process and entailed a new legal situation thereby rendering the Second MOU ineffective; and (ii) Hochtief's ICSID claim against Argentina. The *Hochtief* Arbitration entailed the pursuit of two avenues of redress affecting the renegotiation process.306\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 493-499; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 508-513.\n\n295.\n\nLastly, the Respondent alleges that the toll rate increase of the Rosario-Victoria connection occurred a year and a half after the connection was added to the Concession granted to Caminos del R\u00edo Uruguay, S.A after termination of Puentes' Concession Contract.307\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 514.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n296.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's decision regarding Article 2.2, the Tribunal has decided, for reasons of judicial economy, not to address the discrimination claims in detail.\n\n297.\n\nIn particular, having decided that Argentina violated Article 2.2 (second sentence) of the BIT by unjustified measures, the Tribunal sees no need to decide whether those measures were also discriminatory within the meaning of Article 2.2.308\n\nThe Tribunal has some doubt in any event whether the test of discrimination proffered by Claimant is the right test in the context of an FET provision as it is for Article 3.\n\n298.\n\nArticle 4 of the BIT provides that:\n\n*En caso que los inversores de una de las Partes Contratantes sufrieran p\u00e9rdidas en sus inversiones en el territorio de la otra Parte por causa de guerra o de otros conflictos armados, estados de emergencia u otros acontecimientos pol\u00edticos-econ\u00f3micos similares, la Parte Contratante en cuyo territorio se ha efectuado la inversi\u00f3n conceder\u00e1 en lo relativo a indemnizaciones un tratamiento no menos favorable del que otorgue a sus propios ciudadanos o personas jur\u00eddicas o a los inversores de un tercer Estado.*\n\nIn its unofficial English translation:\n\n*Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing to war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, or other similar political-economic events shall be accorded, by such other Party in whose territory the investment was made, treatment no less favourable than that accorded to its own nationals or legal entities or to investors of any third country as regards damages.*\n\n299.\n\nThis provision has only been argued in passing by the Claimant. It has not been addressed by Respondent. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that its application is limited by its terms to differential damages arising from situations of \"war or other armed conflict, a state of national emergency, or other similar political-economic events\". Given that the Claimant claims damages only from 2006, after the national emergency had ended, it is not clear this Article would apply, and the Tribunal sees no reason to explore it further absent submissions from the Parties.309\n\nAs with Article 2, the Tribunal has doubt whether the concept of \"discrimination\" in this context is satisfied by the same test as for Article 3.\n\n300.\n\nThat leaves Article 3.1, which provides that:\n\n*Cada Parte Contratante, en el \u00e1mbito de su territorio, acordar\u00e1 a las inversiones realizadas por inversores de la otra Parte Contratante, a las ganancias y actividades vinculadas con aqu\u00e9llas y a todas las dem\u00e1s cuestiones reguladas por este Acuerdo, un trato no menos favorable a aqu\u00e9l otorgado a sus propios inversores o a inversores de terceros pa\u00edses.*\n\nIn its unofficial English translation:\n\n*Each Contracting Party shall, in its own territory, accord to investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party, to the returns and activities related thereto and to all other matters regulated by this Agreement, a treatment not less favourable than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of third countries.*\n\n301.\n\nWhile the Tribunal considers that other toll-road concessionaires may well be appropriate comparators, particularly given the lack of any distinction in the Emergency Law between completed and still-in-progress concessions, and the conduct of the Respondent in inviting renegotiation to concessionaires in both categories, more significant questions are presented in relation to other issues this claim presents. With respect to the issue of \"like circumstances\", while it is difficult to imagine what differences could justify the prolonged period of limbo into which Puentes was placed by the renegotiation saga described earlier, it is reasonable to consider that at least some of the factors highlighted by the Respondent that it says set Puentes apart (the subsidy, the Financial Assistance Loan, the carryover effects of financial issues from the construction phase into the operations phase), and particularly those issues that carried over into the operational phase, would have needed to be taken into account in some fashion in the renegotiation process. Other questions include: (i) whether the renegotiation process constitutes a form of \"treatment\" as required by Article 3; and (ii) whether, assuming the \"treatment\" requirement is satisfied, such treatment reflected discrimination on the basis of nationality, no evidence of which has been shown. Given the Tribunal's decision that both the positive and negative obligations of Article 2.2 of the BIT have been breached, the Tribunal sees no benefit in reaching a conclusion on these issues.\n\n**D. Expropriation**\n--------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n302.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the BIT prohibits two types of expropriatory measures. First, neither Contracting Party may directly expropriate an investment of a national of the other Contracting Party. Second, neither signatory may indirectly expropriate through measures having an equivalent effect. In the Claimant's view, common factors that are often considered include the measures' economic impact and whether they violate an investor's legitimate expectations. This second element is derived from the language of the BIT, which provides that the expropriatory measure may not be \"discriminatory or contrary to a commitment undertaken\". Further, there exists a consensus that not only tangible property and physical assets may be expropriated, but that also a broad range of economically significant rights, including legal and contractual rights, might be subject to expropriation.310\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 241-250.\n\n(i) Argentina Indirectly Expropriated the Claimant's Investment\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n303.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, five acts or omissions of Argentina \u2013 taken together \u2013 constitute an indirect expropriation of the Claimant's investment in Puentes' shares, the Concession Contract and the Inter-Company Loans: (i) the Emergency Law; (ii) Resolution 14; (iii) the failure to renegotiate the Concession Contract and restore its economic equilibrium; (iv) the failure to approve Puentes' request to increase its capital so as to comply with Argentine corporate law and avoid Puentes' dissolution; and (v) the Termination Resolution.311\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 251. This latter act is also argued to constitute a direct expropriation. *Ibid.,* \u00b6\u00b6 258-267. *See* \u00b6\u00b6 311-315 *infra.*\n\n304.\n\n**The Emergency Law**. According to the Claimant, it is undisputed that the measures under the Emergency Law, consisting of the pesification and freezing of toll rates as well as the initiation of renegotiation, affected Puentes' economic equilibrium. This was acknowledged by Argentina. The Claimant contends that, nonetheless, Argentina took no effective measure to restore the Concession's equilibrium.312\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 252.\n\n305.\n\n**Failure to Renegotiate the Concession**. In the Claimant's view, it is undisputed that Argentina was obliged to restore the Concession's economic equilibrium pursuant to the Concession Contract. Argentina, Puentes and its shareholders were all aware that the only possible way to re-establish the Concession's economic balance would be to increase Puentes' toll rates.313\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 253.\n\n306.\n\n**Resolution 14**. The Claimant contends that after Puentes opened the bridge to traffic, Argentina issued Resolution 14 which unilaterally changed the financial terms of Argentina's Financial Assistance Loan, thereby worsening Puentes' economic and financial situation. The Claimant asserts that Resolution 14 required Puentes to allocate almost all of its toll revenue to service the Financial Assistance Loan.314\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 254.\n\n307.\n\n**Failure to approve Puentes' increase of capital and termination**. In the Claimant's view, by 2012 Puentes' liabilities exceeded its equity due to Argentina's refusal \u2013 for over ten years \u2013 to grant it toll rate increases. Under Argentine corporate law, Puentes' shareholders were forced to either contribute more equity or dissolve the company. The Claimant alleges that Argentina \u2013 which had to approve the equity increase \u2013 refused to do so. As a result, Puentes' shareholders were forced to dissolve the company, which was then used as a ground for termination by Argentina.315\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 255.\n\n308.\n\nThe Claimant posits that the abovementioned measures destroyed the entire economic value of its investment. These measures also violated the Claimant's legitimate expectations that Argentina would take steps to maintain the Concession's economic equilibrium if Argentina's measures negatively affected that balance as reflected in the Concession Contract, Argentine law and the Regulatory Framework. They also violated the Claimant's legitimate expectations under the Emergency Law and the Contract that the renegotiation process and the six agreements signed by Puentes would restore the Contract's economic equilibrium. The Claimant asserts that, as a consequence, Webuild and Puentes lost their legal rights to possess and control the toll highway and bridge as well as their rights to collect revenue.316\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 256.\n\n309.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the standard proposed by the Respondent, consisting of requiring the seizure of title to determine that an unlawful indirect expropriation has occurred, should not be taken into account. Under the analysis, and contrary to Argentina's criticisms, the practice of considering an investor's legitimate expectations to determine an unlawful expropriation is undisputed. The Claimant further notes that Argentina has not advanced any evidence showing that Puentes was not substantially deprived of its rights.\n\n310.\n\nWith regard to Argentina's police powers argument, the Claimant alleges that the defense has to be non-discriminatory in order to be valid, which is not the case. It also cannot be said that the exercise of police powers has been done with *bona fides*. In particular, Resolution SOP No. 14/03 did not merely implement the terms of the Financial Assistance Loan but imposed abusive loan terms on the Claimant.317\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 293-307.\n\n(ii) The Termination Resolution Constitutes a Direct Expropriation\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n311.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, when deciding whether the termination of a concession is an expropriatory measure, a tribunal must consider whether the termination is in conformity with the contract or whether it was unlawful. Under this analysis, the decisive issue is whether the reasons given for the termination constituted a legally valid ground for terminating the Concession Contract according to its provisions.318\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 258-261.\n\n312.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Argentina failed to provide legal grounds for the Concession Contract's termination and that the grounds it advanced were absurd. The Claimant alleges that despite Argentina framing its reasons within the Contract's permitted grounds for termination, a closer inspection reveals that they are nothing more than pretext.319\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 262.\n\n313.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, Argentina primarily relies on Puentes' dissolution for terminating the Concession Contract, while failing to recognize that its own actions forced the Company's dissolution. Prior to termination, Argentina refused Puentes' request to amend its bylaws and allow an equity increase. It further refused to ratify the Fourth Transitory Agreement, which would have prevented Puentes from dissolving. Further, even though Argentina did not base the Concession Contract's termination on its remaining complaints, these are equally absurd. First, Argentina alleges that Puentes' reorganization proceedings modified the basis of the renegotiation process, making it difficult for the Concessionaire and UNIREN to reach an agreement. Nonetheless, the emergency measures expressly excluded reorganization proceedings as a ground for terminating a concession contract.320\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 264.\n\n314.\n\nSecond, the Claimant disagrees with Argentina that Hochtief's ICSID claim prevented rebalancing the Concession. It notes that years after commencement of the *Hochtief* Arbitration, Argentina continued proposing and signing transitory agreements, giving Puentes the impression that it could resolve its claims with Argentina.\n\n315.\n\nLastly, the Claimant observes that Puentes did not file its administrative complaint against Argentina in bad faith since, by the time Puentes filed the complaint, Puentes had negotiated with Argentina for a decade, had asked Argentina to approve its bylaws amendment allowing an injection of equity, and had agreed to every renegotiation agreement Argentina had proposed.321\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 266.\n\n(iii) Argentina's Expropriation of the Claimant's Investment Was Unlawful\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n316.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, under Article 5 of the BIT, for an expropriation to be lawful the following four requirements need to be met cumulatively: (i) the measure must be for a public purpose, security or national interest of the expropriating State; (ii) the measure must be taken in accordance with due process of law; (iii) the measure must not be discriminatory or contrary to undertaken commitments; and (iv) the measure must be accompanied by prompt, adequate and effective compensation, which represents the fair market value of the expropriated investments.322\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 268.\n\n317.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that Argentina's termination of the Concession Contract was not in the public interest and that Argentina did not claim in the Termination Resolution (or otherwise) that it was terminating the Contract to serve a public interest. The Claimant asks the Tribunal to conclude that Argentina's expropriatory measures were unlawful since Argentina relied on unlawful contractual grounds to terminate the Concession Contract.323\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 268-271.\n\n318.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Argentina's treatment of the Claimant was less favorable than that granted to other toll-road concessionaires. It contends that the Contract's termination substantially differed from that of other very similar concessions.324\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 272-273.\n\n319.\n\nFurther, the Claimant claims that Argentina has never paid any compensation to the Claimant for its expropriatory measures, much less the \"real market value\" that the BIT requires for lawful expropriations.325\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 274-275.\n\n320.\n\nLastly, the Claimant contends that Argentina's expropriatory measures violated due process since (i) Argentina expropriated the Concession Contract on the false pretense that Puentes had breached the agreement, and (ii) Argentina's invoked reasons were the direct consequence of its own conduct.326\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 276-279.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n321.\n\nThe Respondent contends that, as a preliminary matter, it is inconsistent to argue that the same measure qualifies at the same time as both a direct and an indirect expropriation.327\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 502.\n\n322.\n\nIt further argues that there has been neither a direct nor an indirect expropriation in the present case as there has been no formal transfer of title or outright seizure of the Claimant's shares in Puentes, nor has Argentina adopted measures that destroyed the entire economic value of the Claimant's investment.328\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 503-504.\n\n323.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, for an indirect expropriation to occur, the following requirements must be met cumulatively: (i) the disputed measure must interfere with the investor's property rights; (ii) the interference with the investor's property rights must be substantial; and (iii) the measure must not constitute regulations falling within the exercise of the State's police powers.329\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 505.\n\n324.\n\nWith regard to the first requirement for an indirect expropriation, Argentina submits that the interference of the measure at issue with the investor's legitimate expectations does not suffice. Rather, the Claimant should prove the existence of government interference with a specific right in its investment, namely its shares in Puentes. According to Argentina, the Claimant has failed to do so and even continues to exercise its shareholder rights in Puentes as it is party to two court cases that at least at the time of the submissions in this case were pending before Argentine courts. (The current status is unknown to the Tribunal.) The Claimant incorrectly bases its expropriation claim on the non-restoration of the economic equilibrium of the Concession after the Emergency Law, since the disruption of the economic equilibrium occurred before the outbreak of the crisis and the adoption of the emergency measures.330\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 506-510; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 521-528.\n\n325.\n\nRegarding the second requirement, the Respondent argues that the measures at issue did not have the requisite magnitude or severity. Thus, the actions or omissions invoked by the Claimant, whether taken as a whole or individually, do not constitute a substantial deprivation of property rights, nor do they evidence an expropriatory intention or effect. The Respondent further claims that the Claimant bears the burden of proving that it suffered a substantial interference with its property rights.331\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 511-513; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 521-535.\n\n326.\n\nLastly, regarding the final requirement, Argentina claims that good faith, non-discriminatory regulations falling within the exercise of a State's police powers do not amount to expropriation and, therefore, do not require compensation.332\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 514-525; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 536-538.\n\n327.\n\nArgentina submits that the measures did not violate Article 5 of the BIT. The Emergency Law and efforts to renegotiate the Concession Contract were not unreasonable and disproportionate in the face of the grave crisis endured by Argentina. The State could not but enact the Emergency Law and renegotiate the concession contracts. With respect to Resolution 14, the non-approval of Puentes' request regarding the amendment of its bylaws and the termination of the Concession Contract, these were adopted within the framework agreed upon by the Parties in the Concession Contract and the Financial Aid Agreement. In the latter regard, the tribunal in *Impregilo v. Argentina* held that a measure adopted in conformity with obligations assumed by the State and investor under a contract cannot be considered to be expropriatory or compensable.333\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 526-528; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 539-543.\n\n328.\n\nWith regard to the request for the amendment to the bylaws, Argentina claims that it was Puentes' intention to effect a 30-fold reduction of the equity with respect to the amount stated in the Concession Contract, and that it is inconceivable that a company in charge of a road corridor as the one in this case could have equity amounting only to AR$ 1,000,000. The Respondent further claims that the Claimant falsely presents the facts when stating that it requested authorization for a capital stock increase. According to Argentina, what the Claimant requested was a capital stock decrease, from AR$ 30,000,000 to AR$ 1,000,000.334\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 530-531; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 544-545.\n\n329.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the Termination Resolution does not constitute an expropriatory measure. It was issued in response to Puentes' dissolution, which constituted a ground for automatic termination under the Concession Contract based on the fault of the Concessionaire.335\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 532.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n330.\n\nThe Claimant has cited to both paragraphs 1(a) and 1(b) of Article 5 of the BIT in support of its claim of expropriation. However, its arguments are almost exclusively, albeit loosely, focused on the requirements of Article 5.1(b), and do not address Article 5.1(a) in any detail. Accordingly, the Tribunal will focus on Article 5.1(b), which provides\n\n*Las inversiones de los inversores de una de las Partes Contratantes, no ser\u00e1n directa o indirectamente nacionalizadas, expropiadas, incautadas o sujetas a medidas que tengan efectos equivalentes en el territorio de la otra Parte, a no ser que se cumplan las siguientes condiciones:*\n\n*- que las medidas respondan a imperativos de utilidad p\u00fablica, de seguridad o inter\u00e9s nacional;*\n\n*- que sean adoptadas seg\u00fan el debido procedimiento legal;*\n\n*- que no sean discriminatorias ni contrarias a un compromiso contra\u00eddo;*\n\n*- que est\u00e9n acompa\u00f1adas de disposiciones que prevean el pago de una indemnizaci\u00f3n adecuada, efectiva y sin demora.*\n\nIn the unofficial English translation:\n\n*Investments by investors of one of the Contracting Parties shall not be nationalized, expropriated, seized or otherwise appropriated, either directly or indirectly, through measures having an equivalent effect in the territory of the other Party, unless the following conditions are complied with:*\n\n*--the measures are for a public purpose, security or national interest;*\n\n*--they are taken in accordance with due process of law;*\n\n*--they are non-discriminatory or contrary to a commitment undertaken;*\n\n*--they are accompanied by provisions for the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*\n\n331.\n\n*Prima facie*, the Tribunal notes that, at most, the measures identified by the Claimant (the Emergency Law, Resolution 14, the failure to renegotiate the Contract and restore its economic equilibrium, the failure to approve Puentes' request to increase its capital so as to comply with Argentine corporate law and avoid Puentes' dissolution, and the Termination Resolution) could be capable of causing an indirect expropriation, not a direct expropriation. Contrary to Argentina's submission, such expropriation, if any, would not be limited to the \"investment\" (*i.e.*, shares) referenced in the jurisdictional decision.336\n\n*Salini Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/15/39, Decision on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, 23 February 2018, \u00b6 186.\n\n332.\n\nThe termination of the Concession Contract via the Termination Resolution and the subsequent award of the Concession to another party can be seen as the culmination of a series of actions that effectively deprived the Claimant of the value of its investments in Puentes.337 Puentes was formed for the purpose of carrying out the Concession and the Concession Contract is not only a tangible property right, but was the basis on which Puentes carried out its business and thus its key asset. Without the Contract, even if Puentes technically remained in existence for some period of time, its value as an investment vehicle was gone.338\n\nWhile the Termination Resolution may have been technically permitted by the Concession Contract, in the Tribunal's view, that does not prevent its being considered as part of the measures constituting an indirect expropriation.\n\nIt was in any event technically insolvent by that time; hence the need for a capital infusion.\n\n333.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that there is significant overlap with the Claimant's reasoning in regard of the fair and equitable treatment standard, especially as pleaded over the course of the oral hearings. In particular, the Claimant has sought to amalgamate the concept of legitimate expectations, as used in the FET context, with the Article 5.1(b) reference in the third of the four listed requirements to \"commitment undertaken\". Even if there is some overlap on the facts of this case given the BIT's specific reference to commitments, the Tribunal is doubtful that the concept of legitimate expectations, as such, is applicable in the expropriation context. The Tribunal agrees with Argentina that expropriation is focused on the degree of interference with property rights. Nonetheless the Tribunal accepts that there was a commitment by Argentina, both in the Concession Contract and the Emergency Law, to restore the economic equilibrium of the Concession. Thus, even without discrimination, as to which, as set forth in the preceding section, the Tribunal harbors significant doubt, this element could be satisfied. A restoration of the Concession Contract's equilibrium in a timely fashion would presumptively have led to a different ultimate outcome than Puentes' dissolution following its insolvency and the Termination Resolution.\n\n334.\n\nBut the measures the Claimant has challenged in this context are not solely concerned with the failure to restore the Concession's economic equilibrium. They start with the Emergency Law, which surely represents a measure taken for a public purpose, security or national interest. This was a generalized measure, taken in response to a national economic emergency. The Tribunal considers that the Emergency Law as well as the renegotiation process were legitimate exercises by Argentina of its police powers.\n\n335.\n\nThus, the indirect expropriation claim boils down to those measures that were not of general application but were related specially to Puentes and the Concession\u2014Resolution 14, the failure of the renegotiation efforts, the non-approval of the equity infusion, and the Termination Resolution. These are all measures that have been considered in the context of FET and include the measures that have been found either to have constituted a breach of FET or to have exacerbated the situation. Accordingly, judicial economy would suggest there is no need to resolve an expropriation claim unless, if upheld, the damages that would accrue to the Claimant would be more favorable.\n\n336.\n\nArticle 5.1(c) of the BIT specifies the compensation to be given for an expropriation (the Parties disagree as to whether it applies to both lawful and unlawful expropriations). The specific standard is the market value of the investment \"immediately before the expropriation or nationalization decision was announced\". There is also a provision for interest to accrue \"until the date of payment at a normal commercial rate of interest\". In the Tribunal's view, this market value standard applies to lawful expropriations, a circumstance which is not present here. In the event of an unlawful expropriation, the applicable standard would be the customary public international law standard, as reflected in the *Chorzow Factory* decision, as discussed in paragraphs 360 to 363 *infra*.\n\n337.\n\nBased on the foregoing, a finding of an unlawful expropriation would not lead to greater damages than would be the case for a FET violation. For these reasons, the Tribunal considers it unnecessary to consider the expropriation claim further.\n\n**E. Necessity**\n----------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n(i) Safeguarding of Argentina's Essential Interests Against a Grave and Imminent Peril\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n338.\n\nArgentina claims that, in the hypothetical case that the Tribunal should find the challenged measures to be in breach of the BIT, the necessity defense would preclude the wrongfulness of the measures under general international law.339\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 534-540; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 550.\n\n339.\n\nThe Respondent submits that a State may invoke necessity if the act is the only way for the state to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and imminent peril. It further alleges that when faced with the 2001 crisis, it had no choice but to adopt the Emergency Law and related measures adopted in 2002 to safeguard its essential interests. The tribunal in *LG&E v. Argentina* held that a State's essential interest can comprise economic or financial interests. The tribunal further described the seriousness of Argentina's crisis by explaining that 'the conditions as of December 2001 constituted the highest degree of public disorder and threatened Argentina's essential security interests.' The tribunals in *Continental v. Argentina*340 and *Metalpar v. Argentina*341 decided in similar terms.342\n\n**AL RA 236**, *Continental Casualty Company v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/9, Award, 5 September 2008 (\"***Continental*****, Award**\"), \u00b6 180.\n\n**AL RA 224**, *Metalpar S.A. and Buen Aire S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/5, Award, 6 June 2008 (\"***Metalpar*****, Award**\"),\u00b6208.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 544-551; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 554 (footnotes omitted).\n\n340.\n\nThe Respondent further claims that, in the face of this crisis, leading economists affirmed that Argentina's currency board regime could no longer be sustained and that the abrogation of the fixed exchange rate through devaluation and pesification were the only viable alternative.343\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 552-556; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 555-562.\n\n(ii) Non-Contribution of Argentina to the Situation of Necessity\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n341.\n\nThe Respondent affirms that a State may not invoke necessity as a ground to preclude wrongfulness if it has contributed to the situation of necessity. The contribution to the situation must be sufficiently substantial and not merely incidental or peripheral.344\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 561; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 568.\n\n342.\n\nAccording to Argentina, this is not the case at hand. After implementing the convertibility plan under the Washington Consensus following the recommendation of international organizations, Argentina started to face external shocks in 1997. To tackle the recession, Argentina adopted certain measures with the support of international organizations, which provided unfruitful. The recession ultimately resulted in the 2001 crisis.345\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 562-563.\n\n343.\n\nIn this regard, Argentina claims that it made every effort to prevent its economy from collapsing, as acknowledged by the tribunal in *Continental v. Argentina*. Further, as recognized by the tribunal in *Metalpar v. Argentina*, there were several external factors that played a role in Argentina's situation. The Respondent relies on *LG&E v. Argentina* and *Urbaser v. Argentina* which, according to the Respondent, also concluded that Argentina had not contributed to the crisis to the point of precluding necessity as a defense.346\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 564-571, citing **AL RA 236**, *Continental*, Award, \u00b6\u00b6 225-227, 236; **AL RA 224**, *Metalpar*, Award, \u00b6 195; **AL RA 211**, *LG&E Energy Corp., LG&E Capital Corp., LG&E International, Inc. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1, Decision on Liability, 3 October 2006, (\"***LG&E*****, Decision on Liability**\"), \u00b6\u00b6 256-257, and **AL RA 262**, *Urbaser & CABB v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/26, Award, 8 December 2016 (\"***Urbaser*****, Award**\"), \u00b6 710.. Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 578-586.\n\n(iii) No Impairment of an Essential Interest of the State Towards Which the Obligation Exists, or of the International Community\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n344.\n\nThe Respondent raises the point that the international obligations the Claimant alleges Argentina has breached are contained in the Argentina-Italy BIT, a treaty concluded with Italy. In this regard, the emergency measures adopted as a response to the 2001 crisis do not impair the essential interests of Italy, or those of the international community as a whole, as affirmed by the tribunal in *LG&E v. Argentina*.347\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 573-574 (footnotes omitted).\n\n(iv) No BIT Exclusion of Necessity\n----------------------------------\n\n345.\n\nArgentina acknowledges that a State cannot invoke necessity as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if the obligation excludes the possibility of invoking necessity. In this regard, it argues that none of the BIT provisions that the Claimant alleges Argentina has breached exclude the possibility of invoking necessity or limit its invocation.\n\n346.\n\nThe Respondent submits that, pursuant to Article 8.7 of the BIT, the applicable principles of international law are part of the law applicable to the dispute, necessity being included in the applicable international law.348\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 575-577.\n\n***b. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n347.\n\nThe Claimant argues that necessity measures may not continue after the crisis period has ceased.349\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 309.\n\n348.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that Argentina already argued the defense of necessity in the case of *Impregilo v. Argentina*, in which the tribunal held that the emergency measures may not continue after a crisis ends. It concluded that Argentina's economic crisis had almost certainly ended by 2003 and, in any event, before Puentes sought to rebalance the Concession's economic equilibrium. The findings of the *Impregilo* tribunal in this regard are *res judicata* in these proceedings since the four required elements were met: (i) the same parties were parties to a prior final award; (ii) an issue or question was distinctly put at issue; (iii) the tribunal actually decided that issue; and (iv) the holding regarding that issue or question was necessary to one of the holdings in the award's *dispositif*.350\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 310-315; **CL-0003**, *Impregilo*, Award, \u00b6 360.\n\n349.\n\nThe Claimant further clarifies that it does not allege that abrogating the fixed exchange rate or pesification violated its rights under the BIT. Rather, the Claimant contends that its claims concern Argentina's conduct after the crisis and that Argentina cannot claim that during the relevant period for this case it faced a \"grave and imminent peril\".351\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 316-317.\n\n350.\n\nIn the Claimant's view, Argentina has also failed to prove how the adopted measures were the only way to safeguard an essential interest against grave and imminent peril. Nonetheless, the measures that the Claimant alleges violated the BIT are: (i) the abusive terms of the Financial Assistance Loan; (ii) the denial of Puentes' request to increase its share capital to avoid liquidation; (iii) the Concession's termination; and (iv) the failure from 2006 to 2014 to re-establish the Concession's economic equilibrium. According to the Claimant, Argentina failed to prove that any of these measures were the only way to safeguard anything, that an essential interest was at stake and what the grave and imminent peril was.352\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 318-321.\n\n351.\n\nThe Claimant argues that, with regard to the Concession's economic equilibrium, the Emergency Law obligated Argentina to restore the economic equilibrium of affected public concessions. According to the Claimant, at no time during the negotiation of the transitory agreements did Argentina take the position that it could not restore the equilibrium because this would threaten an essential state interest. On the contrary, an Argentine bankruptcy judge ordered Argentina to restore the Concession's economic equilibrium and Argentina restored the economic equilibriums of numerous other similarly-situated concessions.353\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 322-324.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n352.\n\nIn the *Hochtief* Arbitration, the necessity defense under customary international law was dismissed twice. First, the majority of that tribunal did not find that the adoption and pursuit of the policy of pesification was *per se* a breach of the FET standard,354 so no necessity justification was examined. Second, a breach of FET was found by the *Hochtief* tribunal as set forth below, but the tribunal did not consider the necessity defense persuasive. The *Hochtief* tribunal held that\n\n*(1) Respondent's failure to implement timeously the renegotiation process (i.e., by 2006 or 2007, but taking account of prior losses: see paragraph 286 above) and (2) the adoption of Resolution 14 in June 2003, violated the BIT. The next question is whether either breach might be excused or rendered unlawful by the defence of necessity. That would be possible only if the emergency persisted at the relevant time.*355\n\nThe tribunal proceeded to dismiss the necessity defense because it did not consider the emergency to have persisted: \"[t]he economic crisis had ended by the time that the losses for which reparation is due were sustained.\"356\n\n**CL-0013,** *Hochtief,* Decision on Liability, \u00b6 244.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 292.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6 301.\n\n353.\n\nOther tribunals have reached similar findings, including *Impregilo.*357\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 315, including authorities cited at note 566.\n\n354.\n\nThe Parties in the present case have not advanced any arguments that would lead the present Tribunal to conclude differently: the majority of the crisis had passed at the time of breach so the necessity defense is not applicable in this case. As a result, any counterarguments to this defense need not be further discussed, nor any arguments by Argentina that it did not contribute to the state of necessity.\n\n**VI. DAMAGES**\n---------------\n\n**A. Standards of Compensation**\n--------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n355.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Argentina must be ordered to pay full reparations, which would wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would have existed if the act had not been committed. Regarding the compensation to be paid, which Claimant frames principally in the context of an unlawful expropriation, the Claimant argues that customary international law is applicable. Under this analysis, payment of compensation to Webuild should occur, Claimant submits, on the basis of the higher of the market value at the time of expropriation plus interest or the value on the date of the award.358\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 282-298; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6 329.\n\n356.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, even if the expropriation were lawful or the measure of compensation for unlawful expropriation were the same as that provided in the BIT with respect to lawful expropriation, it would still be entitled to prompt, adequate and effective compensation. This would require Argentina to pay full compensation equivalent to the \"actual\" or fair market value of its investment.359\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 300-306.\n\n357.\n\nThe Claimant further alleges that in the event the Tribunal does not consider that Argentina expropriated its investment, Argentina is still bound to compensate it fully under the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard for its unfair and unequitable treatment, its failure to grant full protection and security and its discriminatory measures. In its view, there is strong precedent for basing damages caused by these breaches on the fair market value standard, plus historical or discrete losses when applicable.360\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 307-321.\n\n358.\n\nAs a result, the Claimant requests that, when it comes to the value of its investment, Argentina pay the greater of (i) the market value of the expropriated investment at the time of the Termination Resolution in August 2014, and (ii) the market value of the expropriated investment at the date of the award, calculated with the benefit of post-taking information and assuming that Argentina would have complied with its statutory and contractual obligations related to the Concession. Further, the Claimant contends that Argentina must not only pay the value of its expropriated investment, but must also compensate for all historical, consequential and incidental damages and expenses caused by the expropriation, which would include (i) eliminating the effects of the historical damage caused to Webuild by Argentina's wrongful conduct during the creeping expropriation starting in September 2006 and up to its formal termination of the Concession Contract in August 2014; (ii) compensating for the lost value of Shareholder Loans which could not be re-paid due to Argentina's pre-termination wrongful conduct; and (iii) any other consequential costs and damages suffered by Claimant as a result of the expropriation after August 2014 (arbitration and litigation costs in this ICSID arbitration, including attorneys' fees, etc.).361\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6 322.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n359.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, if the Tribunal determines that there was a breach of the BIT, the standard of compensation will be fair market value.362 The Respondent further asserts that under general principles of international law and the applicable domestic law, the existence of an obligation to compensate Puentes is subject to a series of general principles of international law, which are not present in the Claimant's claim. It identifies the following as relevant principles: causation; reasonableness; damages that are non- hypothetical in amount and limited to the period when the wrongful act occurred; no double recovery; mitigation; repair; and cause and effect.363\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 586.\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 591, 593; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 597-599.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n360.\n\nHaving concluded that the Respondent breached Article 2.2, the Tribunal concurs with the submission of the Claimant that the applicable standard for quantum is the customary international law standard, best reflected in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* decision, rather than the BIT's Article 5 expropriation standard which, in the Tribunal's view, deals with lawful expropriations and is therefore not relevant in this case. Although *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* involved an unlawful expropriation, its damages standard has been applied in cases involving other treaty violations, such as FET, where the underlying treaty did not set forth a standard of damages.364\n\n*See* e.g., **CL-0035**, *Rumeli,* Award \u00b6 792; **CL-0120**, *Gold Reserve Inc. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/09/1, Award, 22 September 2014, \u00b6 615; **CL-0250**, *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic,* ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12- Annulment, Decision on Annulment, 1 September 2009, \u00b6 332; **CL-0009,** *Vivendi I,* Award, \u00b6*\u00b6* 8.2.5, 8.2.7; **CL-0102**, I. Marboe, *Calculation of Compensation and Damages in International Investment Law* (OUP 2009) p. 34.\n\n361.\n\n*Chorz\u00f3w Factory* requires that \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe-out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed\".365 *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* does not, however, detail precisely what methodologies may be consistent with its \"full reparation\" standard. Tribunals applying it, including *S.D. Myers v. Canada*, *CMS v. Argentina, Azurix v. Argentina* and *National Grid v. Argentina,* have considered a number of different methodologies to be appropriate.366 The Tribunal accepts that market value, the standard for lawful expropriations, is not a limitation. As the *ADC v. Hungary* tribunal held, \"the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard requires that the date of valuation should be the date of the Award and not the date of expropriation, since this is what is necessary to put the Claimants in the same position as if the expropriation had not been committed.\"367\n\n**CL-0099**, PCIJ, *The Factory At Chorzow (Claim for Indemnity) (Germany v. Poland),* Judgment, 13 September 1928, p.40.\n\n*See* e.g., **CL-0137**, *S.D. Myers, Inc. v. Canada*, UNCITRAL (NAFTA), Partial Award, 13 November 2000, \u00b6 309; **CL-0005**, *CMS*, Award, \u00b6 410; **CL-0028**, *Azurix Corp. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/01/12, Award, 14 July 2006, \u00b6 424; **CL-0015**, *National Grid*, Award \u00b6\u00b6 269-270, 296.\n\n**CL-0098**, *ADC Affiliated Limited and ADC & ADMC Management Limited v. Republic of Hungary*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/16, Award, 2 October 2004, \u00b6 497.\n\n362.\n\nIn terms of the Respondent's list of principles, the Tribunal notes the overlap among several of them: \"causation\" and \"cause and effect\" seem to be expressing virtually the same concept that is implied in *Chorz\u00f3w Factory's* use of the term \"consequence\"\u2014*i.e.*, that the damages must flow from the wrongful act; while \"mitigation\" and \"repair\" also seem to be highly similar. Many tribunals have emphasized that while damages are not always susceptible of being quantified with complete precision, they need to be reasonable in amount and not too remote. Avoiding double recovery and requiring appropriate mitigation are also recognized as relevant principles in the context of full reparation. Whether they should be limited to the time period when the wrongful act occurred is more questionable; in the Tribunal's view, the principle of full reparation for the consequences of the act is the overriding principle, while principles such as non-remoteness rather than a temporal limit *per se* will operate to contain the extent of recoverable damages.\n\n363.\n\nBefore turning to the actual calculation of quantum, the Tribunal will address the issue of causation raised by the Respondent.\n\n**B. Causation**\n----------------\n\n364.\n\nThe Respondent maintains that the Claimant's, not the Respondent's, conduct is the cause of Puentes' ultimate financial failure and dissolution; that the disruption of the economic equilibrium was caused by the Claimant's failure to obtain financing and preceded Argentina's economic emergency; that its insolvency was the result of how Puentes dealt with its subcontractors.368 For these reasons, Argentina considers that it should have no damages liability; its experts' calculations reflecting some liability are provided in the event the Tribunal concludes to the contrary.369\n\nThis position is best illustrated by the Respondent's \"chain of events\" slide in its closing presentation at the Hearing. *See* Respondent's Closing Statement, slide 169.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 608.\n\n365.\n\nThe Claimant maintains that these events did not cause the ultimate failure of Puentes, and it was the \"financial asphyxiation\" of the company due to the failure of Argentina to restore the Concession's economic equilibrium following the emergency, exacerbated by the burdens of the Financial Assistance Loan as modified by Resolution 14, that did so.370\n\n*See, e.g.,* **CWS-0003,** Witness Statement of Gabriel Hern\u00e1ndez, 17 Dec. 2016, \u00b6 35.\n\n366.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider the financing failure, whatever its causes, to have been responsible for the destruction of Puentes. The financing failure\u2014which in the Tribunal's view most likely was the result of a mix of commercial and macroeconomic factors which are difficult to isolate with any precision--\u2014undoubtedly created problems for the completion of the Project.371 As Respondent has highlighted, Puentes itself in 2001, prior to the enactment of the Emergency Law, characterized its financial difficulties as a state of disruption of the economic equilibrium of the Concession Contract.372 This characterization of its economic difficulties seems odd to the Tribunal, since the Project was not completed at that time and Puentes therefore had no operating revenues (although it did have subsidies). However, it clearly reflects the financial challenges Puentes was then confronting which threatened the completion of construction. (It was fortuitous in the Tribunal's view that construction was as advanced as it was by the time the Emergency Law was enacted.) But those problems were ultimately overcome, and the Project entered into operation in 2003. Thereafter, the factor that in the Tribunal's judgment most crippled Puentes in the operational stage was the lack of increase in its toll rates over a prolonged period, leaving it unable to cover its operating costs and service its debt, including the onerous obligations imposed by the Financial Assistance Loan, as modified by Resolution 14. This was the direct result of the failure of Argentina to meet its obligation to restore the economic equilibrium of the Contract after a reasonable time.\n\nThe *Hochtief* tribunal found that \"there were 'many issues' that prevented the IDB from disbursing the loan in the manner anticipated by the Consortium.\" *Hochtief*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6 222.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 599-604, citing to, *inter alia,* **RA-011**, letter from PDL to OCCOVI of 3 August 2001.\n\n367.\n\nHad the economic equilibrium of the Concession been restored in 2006, as the Tribunal has concluded it should have been, it is reasonable to assume that Puentes would have been able to avoid Boskalis-Ballast's filing of the insolvency petition, and the subsequent reorganization proceedings in 2007. To be sure, Puentes had a debt overhang from the construction phase, including not only the subcontractor debt to Boskalis-Ballast and Shareholder Loans, but also the high-cost Financial Assistance Loan. The Financial Assistance Loan was secured by the toll revenues of Puentes and therefore had priority of payment in the period in question, leaving even fewer resources to cover other obligations and operating costs. As noted earlier in the discussion of FET, the Tribunal considers that the FAL, as modified by Resolution 14, contributed to the economic problems of Puentes.373\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 251-267 *supra*.\n\n368.\n\nAlthough the Tribunal finds that the financial failure of Puentes was the consequence of the failure to restore the Concession's economic equilibrium and that the legal element of causation is therefore satisfied, it considers it inappropriate to hold Argentina responsible for 100% of the damage. As the Tribunal noted in its analysis of the admissibility of the Webuild Shareholder Loan claims, beyond the need to avoid double recovery, consideration must be given to precisely how those claims and the pre-operational financial challenges of Puentes in general should be taken into account, in recognition of the fact that Puentes' economic challenges were not entirely of Argentina's creation and resulted in an \"overhang\" in the operational phase of the Project. The Tribunal will return to this issue after discussing the quantum calculation issues that have been raised.\n\n**C. Quantum**\n--------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n369.\n\nWebuild presents a damages methodology that measures the fair market value of its investment in Puentes as of the date of the Termination Resolution in August 2014 (the \"**Valuation Date**\"), comprised of two projected income streams: (i) historical damages from 1 September 2006 to the Valuation Date; and (ii) future damages from the Valuation Date to the end of the Concession on 13 September 2023, discounted back to the Valuation Date. The calculation assumes on a \"but for\" basis that Argentina had implemented the terms of the 2006 LOU by September 2006, as provided therein. The Claimant's experts thus estimate the value of the Claimant's equity and debt share in Puentes as of 31 August 2014 assuming that Puentes' toll rates would have been initially adjusted on 1 September 2006, and would have been recalculated 12 months later, in order to restore the Concession's economic equilibrium.374\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 324.\n\n370.\n\nThe Claimant's experts rely primarily on the discounted cash flow (\"**DCF**\") method, or \"income\" approach, which has four main value drivers: (i) AR$ revenues, determined by AR$ toll rates and traffic; (ii) operating expenses (including sales, general and administrative expenses); (iii) capital expenditures; and (iv) discount rate.375\n\n*Ibid*., \u00b6\u00b6 328-329.\n\n371.\n\nThe Claimant's experts value Puentes at US$ 764.8 million in the \"but for\" scenario as of 31 August 2014. After deducting debt repayments and multiplying the remaining equity value by the 26% ownership of Puentes by Webuild, the experts obtain equity damages to Webuild of US$ 167.2 million. They also conclude that in this \"but for\" scenario, Webuild would have recovered its loans to Puentes plus interest after Puentes honored its debts with other creditors, in the amount of US$ 52.8 million.376\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 331-332.\n\n372.\n\nIn total, the Claimant's experts initially calculate damages to Webuild (taking into account both debt and equity) in the amount of US$ 219.9 million under the income approach and US$ 285.3 million under the alternative \"net capital contributions\" (\"**NCC**\") approach.377\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 333-335.\n\n373.\n\nIn its Reply on the Merits, the Claimant provided an updated amount on damages (both debt and equity) to Webuild in the sum of US$ 174.2 million under the income approach, and US$ 176.9 million under the NCC approach.378\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 389. Under the income method, the damages component represented by the equity stake was US$ 121.4 million, with the debt amounting to US$ 52.8 million, while under the NCC method, the equity stake represented US$ 59.3 million, with the debt amounting to US$ 117.6 million.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n374.\n\nThe Respondent's experts valued Webuild's stake in Puentes based on the guidelines established by the *Hochtief* tribunal. Instead of the 31 August 2014 Valuation Date used by the Claimant, the Respondent submits that the date should be in 2002, as was the case in the *Hochtief* arbitration*.* It also argues for a different methodology, \"free cash flows to shareholders\", as was used by the Tribunal in *Hochtief,* instead of \"free cash flow to firm\", as used by the Claimant's experts*.*\n\n375.\n\nIn its Counter-Memorial, after opining that no damages should be awarded, the Respondent's experts calculated the value of Webuild's stake in Puentes in the amount of US$ 11.63 million as of 31 August 2014.379 In the Rejoinder, the experts calculated a value for that stake of US$ 10.93 million as of 31 August 2014.380\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 610, 612.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 612.\n\n376.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, Puentes' allegations relating to the termination of the Concession Contract cannot give rise to a claim under the BIT, but merely form a claim under the Contract which Puentes has submitted to the Argentine courts. The Respondent contends that this item should not be compensated in the present treaty proceedings.381\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 611.\n\n377.\n\nLastly, the Respondent disputes a number of the assumptions on the basis of which the Claimant's experts have made their \"but for\" calculations, as well as some of the calculations.382 These are discussed in detail in the course of the Tribunal's analysis below and will not therefore be detailed at this juncture.\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 614-618.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n378.\n\nThe Tribunal does not consider the approach to the calculation of damages taken by the *Hochtief* tribunal to be appropriate for this case. Hochtief's FET claim was put forward on a materially different basis than the FET claim in this case, challenging *inter alia* the pesification effected by the Emergency Law and claiming an entitlement to dollarized tariffs.383 It also covered a different period of time. Although the *Hochtief* tribunal did not accept the proposed damage calculations of either the Claimant or the Respondent in that case and performed its own calculation, it nonetheless awarded damages on the basis of the Emergency law's elimination of pesification and toll rate increases based on the U.S. CPI,384 beginning on 23 May 2003, when it found the income stream began to be affected.385\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 347-351.\n\n*Hochtief*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6 316.\n\n*Hochtief*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6 326.\n\n379.\n\nIn contrast, the basis of the Claimant's case here is not pesification, but Argentina's failure within a reasonable time following the end of the emergency to restore the economic equilibrium of the Concession Contract. Webuild has not sought to recover any damages for the period between 2002 and 2006 (including the period of the Financial Assistance Loan). Its historical damage calculations begin in September 2006, grounded in the terms of the 2006 LOU. Its \"but for\" scenario is consistent with the basis of the FET violation that the Tribunal has determined took place (*i.e.,* the failure to restore the Concession's economic equilibrium at the time of the 2006 LOU).\n\n380.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, therefore, the approach proposed by the Respondent is inapposite. The Tribunal further considers that the DCF model, put forward by the Claimant as its primary method of valuation, which in the Tribunal's experience is a widely accepted methodology in investment treaty disputes where a completed and operating project is involved, is the most suitable model for this case.\n\n381.\n\nThe Tribunal is also not persuaded that the methodology of free cash flow to shareholders, the approach taken by the *Hochtief* tribunal, instead of the free cash flow to the firm (*i.e.,* Puentes), used by the Claimant's experts, is the most appropriate methodology, nor that some of the assumptions made by that tribunal, *e.g.*, assuming repayment of all debt before any distributions would be made to shareholders, reflect the most likely conditions in an operating scenario in which the economic equilibrium of the Concession has been restored and Puentes is therefore engaged in normal operations.\n\n382.\n\nThe Tribunal's remaining analysis will therefore focus on the DCF model proposed by Claimant, the methodology of free cash flow to the firm, and the calculations of damages pursuant to that model, and consider the issues raised by the Respondent with respect to the DCF calculations, including the assumptions on which those calculations are based.\n\n383.\n\nAs noted earlier, the four key drivers of value in the DCF calculations are: revenues (driven by toll rates and traffic assumptions); operating expenses; capital expenditures; and the discount rate (for cash flows from the Valuation Date to the end of the Concession on 13 September 2023). In the subsections below, the Tribunal will discuss the issues raised by the Respondent with respect to three of these four areas\u2014revenues, expenses and the discount rate (no issues appear to have been raised with respect to capital expenditures). With respect to some of the issues, the Tribunal defers any decision pending further submissions and/or calculations from the Parties. Its requests for further information are set forth in each relevant subsection below and summarized in a separate subsection at the end of this section.\n\n(i) Revenues\n------------\n\n*(a) Reliance on toll rates in 2006 LOU in \"but for\" and frequency of toll rate increases*\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n384.\n\nThe Respondent objects to the Claimant's experts' reliance on toll rates in the 2006 LOU in its \"but for\" scenario, asserting that they are too high, including in comparison to the current concessionaire. The Respondent also argues that the monthly toll rate increases assumed by the Claimant's experts are not provided for in the 2006 LOU.386\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 613-617; Respondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6\u00b6 607-611; *see also* Respondent's Closing Statement, slides 194 and 198.\n\n385.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the 2006 LOU is consistent with the approach taken by Argentina in the Bid and Concession Contract, in the renegotiation of other concessions, and was proposed by Argentina; it also criticizes the use by Argentina's experts of dollarized tolls given pesification and asserts that comparing the toll rates of the current concessionaire is inapposite given that concessionaire's lack of investment in the Project.387\n\nReply, \u00b6\u00b6 353 *et seq*; Claimant's Opening Statement, slides 118-119.\n\n386.\n\nAs noted earlier, the Tribunal considers reliance on the toll rates in the 2006 LOU to be appropriate in this case. They are not hypothetical or speculative, and are consistent with the basis of the finding that the FET standard was violated by the failure to restore the Concession's economic equilibrium at that time. The toll rates in the DCF model used by the Claimant's experts conform to the toll rates set forth in the 2006 LOU. Section Five (Rate Schedule) of that document provides: \"[w]ith a view to partially restoring the economic-financial equation under the CONCESSION CONTRACT, a new Rate Schedule is hereby established for the CONCESSION as set forth in Annex IV hereto \u2026\"388\n\n**Exhibit C-0171**, First Letter of Understanding (LOU), 16 May 2006. This document is also referred to in the Parties' and Experts' submissions as an MOU.\n\n387.\n\nThe damages report of the Claimant's experts states that: \"we assume that the toll rate review set out in the 2006 MoU[389] would have been ratified and completed. Therefore, using the 2006 PEF, we estimate the toll rate level that would allow the Concessionaire to obtain the regulated rate of return as explained in Section IV.2 and in detail in Appendix B.\"390\n\nBambaci-Dellepiane Damages Report of 2 January 2017, **CER-0001**, p. 42, \u00b6 83 [footnote inserted].\n\n388.\n\nThe reference to the \"2006 PEF\" (*Plan Economico Financiero)* is to \"the valuation model used by the regulator to estimate the economic equilibrium of the Concession,\" and is based on the model presented by the Consortium of which Webuild was part and adjusted to reflect Argentina's new economic reality in 2006.391\n\n*Id.* p. 63, \u00b6. 115. The 2006 PEF appears to be reflected in Exhibit BD-35, which is entitled the *Plan Econ\u00f3mico Financiero para Renegociaci\u00f3n.* Argentina submitted for the first time at the Hearing on the Merits that this exhibit was not part of the 2006 MOU and has never been validated. Respondent's Closing Statement, slide 184. Although this exhibit does not appear to be included in the annexes to the 2006 MOU, that does not necessarily in the Tribunal's view call the validity of the document into question. Moreover, Annex II to the 2006 MOU is entitled *Plan Econ\u00f3mico Financiero.* As first introduced into the record, it was not legible, but was provided in a legible form by the Claimant following the Hearing at the Tribunal's request. *See* \u00b6\u00b6 46-47, *supra.* The Claimant's expert, Ms. Bambaci, explained at the Hearing that Annex II was derived from **BD-35**, an Excel spreadsheet containing the output from the 2006 PEF. Tr. 8:1129-1148. The Respondent also commented on Exhibit **BD-35** in a post-Hearing submission, in response to statements made by the Claimant when it provided the legible documents. *See* \u00b6\u00b6 47-48, *supra.* In any event the *ingresos* set forth in the two documents for toll revenues appear to be consistent, so whatever distinctions there may be between the two documents may not be relevant in any event.\n\n389.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees that the current concessionaire's lack of investment in the Project makes it an inappropriate comparator for purposes of evaluating the toll rates in the \"but for\" scenario. As noted above, it considers the 2006 LOU to provide a reasonable basis for revised toll rates that would have represented, in the words of that LOU, a \"partial restoration\" of the Concession's equilibrium.\n\n390.\n\nUnder the terms of the 2006 LOU, the new toll rates it specified appear to have a duration of a year-plus (the remainder of 2006 and 2007). Section 6 of that document permits the Concessionaire, starting on 31 December 2007, to apply for a rate redetermination based on a cost increase as measured by specified indices in excess of 5%. It goes on to specify a process for approval of rate redetermination requests that initially involves OCCOVI and ultimately the \"National Executive Branch\", during a period not to exceed 150 days.\n\n391.\n\nThe Concession Contract seemed to contemplate toll increases on an annual basis (Article 25.2), again depending on cost increases as measured by the CPI. Annex II to the 2006 LOU, the *Plan Econ\u00f3mico Financiero,* also appears to assume annual increases in toll rates.392 In the Tribunal's view, this is a more realistic interval than a monthly interval, given the Government approvals involved and the linkage to price increases. Unlike the 2006 LOU, the Contract provision does not appear to limit toll rate increases to situations where costs have increased more than 5%. Given that Puentes agreed to the 2006 LOU, however, in the Tribunal's view, this is an appropriate limitation.\n\n**Exhibit C-0171,** Annex II, p. 1.\n\n392.\n\nIt is not clear to the Tribunal at this juncture what impact, if any, the frequency of toll increases has on the revenue calculation. Given the possibility that it does, and that such impact may be material, the Tribunal considers that a recalculation of toll rate increases on the basis of annual rate increases linked to the price indices set forth in Section 6 of the 2006 MOU and including the 5% threshold specified therein, is in order. It therefore instructs the Parties to provide an agreed recalculation on this basis or, if a recalculation cannot be agreed, for each party to submit its recalculation.\n\n*(b) Assumption regarding toll subsidy*\n---------------------------------------\n\n393.\n\nThe Respondent has questioned whether a subsidy incorporated into the revenue calculations of the Claimant's quantum experts is appropriate on two grounds: first, whether this subsidy would extend beyond 2006, particularly in light of the Respondent's submission that tariff compensation ceased to be granted to all road concessionaires in 2012; and second, because it is not included in the 2007 LOU or the Transitory Agreements.393\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, slides 185-188.\n\n394.\n\nThe Claimant has indicated that this subsidy was put forward by Argentina in the 2006 LOU, and Argentina's submissions seem at least implicitly to accept that position. As to its duration, one of its testifying quantum experts indicated on redirect during the Hearing that, based on the terms of section 12 of the 2006 LOU, if the subsidy had been abolished in 2012, that provision would require its replacement by something similar.394 She went on to testify that if that were the case, there would be no substantial effect on the calculation of revenues.395 The Claimant has indicated that its calculations assume the same level of subsidies will continue throughout the term of the Concession.396\n\nTr. Day 9: 1177 *et seq*. (redirect of Ms. Bambaci). The relevant text reads (in translation): \"*The circumstance shall not prevent the \u2026 'compensation method from being replaced' \u2026 if doing so is previously agreed upon by the Parties with another method that correctly recognizes the economic impact of the referred rate reduction.*\" Tr. Day#9:1178:21-1179:4.\n\nTr. Day 9: 1179: 18.\n\nTr. Day 2: 222: 11 *et seq.*\n\n395.\n\nOCCOVI Resolution No. 14/2012 is the document reflecting the abolition of the subsidy in 2012.397 Argentina devoted some attention to this issue in its closing presentation at the Hearing,398 but did not quantify the effect on revenues. The Tribunal does not have evidence indicating why the provision may not have been included in the 2007 LOU or Transitory Agreements.\n\n**Exhibit C-0289**, Resolution No. 140/2012, 26 Jan. 2012.\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, slides 186-199.\n\n396.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a decision on whether the subsidies would be maintained for the duration of the Concession is premature. It asks the Parties to provide an indication in the revised damages calculation of what the impact would be if the subsidies did not continue beyond 2012.\n\n*(c) Elasticity*\n----------------\n\n397.\n\nThe Respondent submits that higher toll rates would lead to lower traffic on the toll road. In its view, this implies a higher elasticity rate than that posited by the Claimant's experts: -0.30 for light traffic (*e.g.*, passenger vehicles) and -0.25 for heavy traffic (*e.g.*, trucks and commercial vehicles).399\n\nRespondent's Closing Statement, slide 199. *See also* First UTDT Report, pp. 60-64 and Second UTDT Report, pp. 36-40.\n\n398.\n\nThe Claimant disagrees, noting that the majority of users of the toll road are commercial truck drivers (*i.e.*, drivers of heavy vehicles) and that the alternatives to the toll road require traveling much longer distances, making these users more willing to continue to use the toll road even in the face of higher tolls. Their elasticity numbers are substantially different, particularly for heavy traffic: -0.22 for light traffic and -0.05 for heavy traffic.400\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 363 *et seq*; Claimant's Opening Statement, slide 121*. See also* First BRG Report, App. D, pp. 85-92 and Second BRG Report, Section VI.2, pp. 42-47 and Appendix E, pp. 84-88.\n\n399.\n\nTo address this issue, the Tribunal considers it helpful first to review the toll rate scheme in general. The table below prepared by Claimant's quantum experts illustrates the seven categories of vehicles for which tolls would be assessed, and the toll rates for each, under the 2006 LOU as of 1 September 2006 and prior thereto:\n\n***Sourc: Bombad - Dellepiane based on 2006 Plan Econ\u00f3mico Financiero (BD-035) and Concession Contract (BD-004).***\n\nBased on the elasticity figures in the table below, the Tribunal understands that categories 5-7 are what are considered to constitute \"heavy\" traffic, while categories 1-4 are treated as \"light\" traffic.\n\n**Table 9: Summary of Elasticity Parameters used by vehicle categoiy**\n\n***Source: Bambaci - Dellepiane model, sheet \"Vol Revs (m) \" (BD-005)(***\n\n400.\n\nWhile the user profile does seem to suggest a basis for the Claimant's experts' assumptions regarding elasticity, especially as it concerns the so-called \"heavy\" traffic categories, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent's proposed elasticity numbers are apparently those put forward by Hochtief's quantum expert witness Philip Bates in its ICSID arbitration.401 Although Mr. Bates' report does not appear to be in the public domain, the *Hochtief* tribunal's Decision on Liability suggests that the \"but for\" toll rates were set forth in Dollars rather than Argentine pesos (consistent with the theory of the case).402\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 613.c.\n\n**CL-0013,** *Hochtief*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 250, 312, 313.\n\n401.\n\nIn accepting the Claimant's experts' estimation of toll receipts in their \"but for\" scenario, the *Hochtief* tribunal adopted the lower end of the range of elasticity values contained in the \"envelope\" of values proposed by Mr. Bates.403 In these proceedings, the Respondent has put forward multiple values, all lower than those put forward by the Claimant, that include calculations using the lower end of the envelope of values put forward by Mr. Bates in the *Hochtief* proceedings.404\n\n**CL-0013,** *Hochtief*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6 318.\n\nFirst Report of Machinea/Schargrodsky, 18 June 2017, \u00b6\u00b6 186-195.\n\n402.\n\nGiven the differences in framing between the *Hochtief* case and the instant case, as well as and the evidence that has been submitted in these proceedings, the Tribunal does not consider it appropriate to simply accept the *Hochtief* elasticity values. In particular, the Claimant's Reply evidence would seem to suggest that users, particularly those in the \"heavy traffic\" categories who are likely to be commercial users, would be less affected by toll rate increases than might be the case if the alternatives were better. The *Hochtief* tribunal did not cite detailed evidence in support of its decision, but simply expressed a preference for the lower end of the spectrum put forward by the expert.405\n\nAs its reason for selecting the lower end, the *Hochtief* tribunal stated only that it \"considers that it is appropriate, given the burden that lies upon the Claimant to prove its case, to prefer the experts' calculations based on Mr Bates' lower bound figures\". *Hochtief*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6 318*.*\n\n403.\n\nThere is undisputed evidence before the Tribunal that that the alternatives to the toll road established by the Project involve traveling significantly greater distances, with concomitant costs in time and operating expense of the vehicles involved. The excerpts below (taken from the Claimant's Opening Statement at the Hearing)406 show, first, the Rosario-Victoria route established by the Project and the associated time and distance, and second, the alternative routes, with time and distance.\n\nClaimant's Opening Statement, slide 4.\n\n404.\n\nIn other words, there are no easy alternatives to the Project's toll road for those wanting to travel east-west in that part of Argentina. This does not tell the Tribunal what the precise elasticity should be, but it does support the view that there would be some degree of demand inelasticity, which would be greater for heavier traffic, that pays the higher tolls, than passenger cars or non-commercial vehicles, who may be less sensitive to the time value of money and less able to pass increased costs through.\n\n405.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that it requires further information in order to decide this issue. It therefore requests that the Parties agree on a revised calculation, in the context of the overall set of revisions requested herein, that makes three different assumptions of elasticity: namely, the Bates envelope of elasticities at the low end, high end and midpoint. In addition, if those calculations do not do so already, they should reflect greater inelasticity for heavy than light traffic (reflecting the differential levels set forth in Table 9 above), in light of the evidence before the Tribunal. The Respondent is instructed to share with the Claimant any information the Claimant may require to prepare this calculation. If the Parties cannot agree on a recalculation, each party should submit its recalculation.\n\n*(d) Rate of Return Assumptions*\n--------------------------------\n\n406.\n\nThe Respondent has criticized the internal rate of return (\"**IRR**\") on the Project assumed by the Claimant's experts in their calculations, in two respects: first, because in its view the model uses a guaranteed rate of return for the Project, which is not provided for in the Concession Contract; and second, because the \"but for\" IRR of 9.18% is greater than the expected IRR.407\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, slide 157.\n\n407.\n\nThe calculations of the Claimant's experts do not appear to stem from the assumption that the Contract guarantees a specific rate of return to the Claimant, but that the Concession's original economic equilibrium was based on assumptions about the internal rate of return (also referred to as the regulated rate of return as noted below). Consequently, a restoration of that equilibrium would imply a similar rate of return.\n\n408.\n\nIn their first Report, the Claimant's experts Bambaci and Dellapiane state that:\n\n*The initial economic equilibrium of the Concession was determined by the cash flows presented by the winning Consortium during the bidding process. Contemplating the investments required, and the cash flows expected (at the allowed per-car toll rate of US$ 7.40), the resulting internal rate of return or 'IRR' of these forecasts was 12.94% ('regulated rate of return'). The internal rate of return of a project is that which reconciles positive expected future cash flows so that when expressed in present value, they are equal to the value of investments (i.e. negative cash flows), and therefore the net present value (NPV) equals zero.*408\n\nBRG First Report, \u00b6 44. *See also* Appendix B.\n\n409.\n\nTheir first report calculated the original equilibrium of the Concession in real U.S. Dollars. However, in the second Report, they determined that the original equilibrium was actually measured in a combination of nominal and real U.S. Dollars, resulting in a re-calculation of the original IRR. This resulted in a decrease in the original IRR from 12.94% to 8.87%.409\n\n*See* BRG Second Report, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. This obviously undercut the statements made by the Claimant based on the first report about \"shared sacrifice\".\n\n410.\n\nIn its second report, the Claimant's experts indicate that the IRR of the cash flows they calculate for the Project is in fact 9.18% due to the \"actual evolution of traffic rather than the expected [in the 2006 PEF]\".410 They confirm that the IRR of their new cash flow calculation is 9.18%, which, they say, is \"not substantially different\" than the target IRR of 8.87%.\n\nBRG Second Report, \u00b6 63.\n\n411.\n\nThe Respondent is correct that the Concessionaire was not guaranteed a particular return from the Project. Indeed, it is not contested that the Contract was an \"at risk\" contract from a commercial perspective.411 However, the 2006 LOU, Section 4, entitled Rate of Return, appears to contemplate the calculation of an IRR based in constant pesos as at September 1997 for the entire Concession period, and a waiver of the IRR rights set forth in the Concession Contract.412 The issue therefore appears to the Tribunal to be more one of calculation than concept.\n\nThe Claimant does not accept that this encompassed sovereign, or government, risk. *See*, e.g., Claimant's Opening Statement, slide 19, citing to Concession Contract, Art. 31.2, **C-0008**.\n\n**C-0031**, Letter from UNIREN to Puentes attaching the First MOU, 10 May 2006; **C-0171**, Letter from Puentes to UNIREN, 16 May 2006 (sending the First MOU signed and dated).\n\n412.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that insofar as an IRR is based on actual, historical numbers, an increase from 8.87% to 9.18% may be explainable.413 However, to the extent that future projections assume a higher rate of return than the IRR assumed in the 2006 LOU, the Tribunal has difficulty with the justification for such increase, particularly where the Project will continue, in the Claimant's projections, to secure State subsidies. It may also be questioned whether the conditions that led to an increase in the historical period could be sustained.\n\nIn their original report, Bambaci and Dellapiane concluded that the *ex post* rate of return, which they also refer to as an \"implicit\" IRR, in the \"but-for\" valuation was 8.449% rather than 12.94% due to the effects of the crisis, particularly changes in the foreign exchange regime, on the economic equilibrium. **CER-0001,** \u00b6\u00b6 12, 95. However, their second report uses the 12.94% IRR figure, and does not seem to pick up the \"ex post\" or \"implicit\" IRR concepts used in the first report.\n\n413.\n\nAccordingly, the Tribunal asks the Claimant to clarify to what extent, if any, future cash flows are calculated based on an IRR in excess of 8.87%, and specify the basis of such calculations. Further, to the extent that is the case, the Tribunal requests an adjusted calculation based on the 8.87% rate, along with a calculation using the 9.18% rate, so that the effect of any higher rate that the Claimant's experts consider historical performance may justify is clear.\n\n*(e) Adjustment of Working Capital*\n-----------------------------------\n\n414.\n\nThe final issue raised by the Respondent with respect to the \"but for\" calculation of revenues relates to an adjustment to the working capital of Puentes made by the Claimant's experts. According to the Respondent, a deferred tax benefit was incorporated into the model as a current asset, when in its view, it is a non-current asset. The effect of the inclusion of this tax benefit, it is asserted, artificially increased the cash flows of Puentes for 2006 and thereafter, with an overall impact on the damages calculation of US$ 27.2 million.414\n\nRespondent's Opening Statement, slide 158; Respondent's Closing Statement, slides 195-197.\n\n415.\n\nThe Claimant's experts, in their second report, appear to address this issue (relating to tax credits), stating that:\n\n*227. As of 2005, PdL's Financial Statements reflected uncertainty as to whether it would be able to use its accumulated tax credits, and therefore registered only part of it as an asset. The Financial Statements explain that only the tax credit recoverable within the legal prescription periods were added to the 'other non-current credits,' so the total carryforward tax (i.e., tax credit) is provisioned. In our first report, we assumed that PdL would only be able to recover this limited amount of tax credit. This assumption was incorrect.*\n\n*228. In our but-for scenario, the company would have been able to use its accumulated tax credits to reduce the income tax payable amounts arising from the higher revenue from the renegotiated tariffs. In this updated assessment, we introduce an income tax credit of AR$ 135,580,968 (or US$ 46.379.159) as stated in PdL's 2005 Financial Statement. In fact, Machinea-Schargrodsky agree with this assumption as they have included the accumulated tax credit in their own valuation based on the Hochtief Award.*415\n\nBRG Second Report, \u00b6\u00b6 227-228.\n\n416.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view, this explanation only partially addresses the issues raised by Argentina. The Tribunal understands that a tax loss carryover, which appears to result in a tax credit, would increase the profitability of Puentes and in consequence, cash flows in a DCF calculation. The Tribunal is not certain it understands the implications of the current versus non-current asset issue raised by Argentina. Paragraph 227 quoted above seems to suggest Puentes's historical tax losses (or at least the ones whose future availability to Puentes was uncertain as of 2005) were in fact treated as non-current assets, while the portion that could be used was in fact treated as a current asset. If this is correct, then the Tribunal would understand that the \"but-for\" scenario would permit the use of the remainder of the tax loss carryover as a credit for the period permitted by Argentine law. Assuming a five-year loss carryforward, Puentes would be able to use the remainder of its previous losses in 2007-2010 (since 2006 was Year 1), but not in any years thereafter. Given the apparent magnitude of this item in relation to the quantum of damages, the Tribunal seeks confirmation from the Parties before deciding this issue that: (i) its understanding of the \"current\" versus \"non-current\" asset issue as set forth above is correct; (ii) whether under Argentine law loss carryovers are in fact limited to five years; and (iii) that the treatment of this issue in the experts' calculations is consistent with the legal position in Argentine law. If the relevant period is five years, revised calculations shall also be provided.\n\n(ii) Expenses\n-------------\n\n*(a) Recalculation of Interest Rate on Financial Assistance Loan*\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n417.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the decision by the Claimant's experts, in the \"but for\" scenario, to reduce the interest rate on the Financial Assistance Loan.416 This was the rate, it will be recalled, that was set subsequent to the FAL by Resolution 14.417 The reduction has the effect of increasing the value of the Claimant's equity investment by US$ 2.7 million.418\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 613.d.\n\n*Supra* \u00b6\u00b6 103-105.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 364.\n\n418.\n\nThe Claimant's response to this criticism is that it was proper to recalculate the interest rate on the Financial Assistance Loan, since the rate, unilaterally fixed by Resolution 14, was abusive.419 Moreover, it submits that the rate was reduced in the 2006 LOU and with equilibrium restored, Puentes would have been able to borrow commercially.420\n\n*Ibid. See also* **CER-0001,** \u00b6 136.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6 364; *see also* Claimant's Opening Statement, slide 122: \"*[i]t is economically rational to assume that interest rates would be reduced in the 'but for' scenario because the uncertainty of repayment is mitigated by the toll-rate increase resulting from implementation of the 2006 MOU.*\"\n\n419.\n\nIt appears to the Tribunal that the rate may well have been reduced in the 2006 LOU. Section 9 of that LOU appears to peg the rate to the Interest Rate for Loans to Leading Companies in the 25th percentile, as published by the Central Bank, or to an annual rate of 9.5%, whichever is higher.421 It is not clear what these new rates would have been under the 2006 LOU; the Parties are requested specifically to confirm them, and Claimant is also asked to confirm the rates assumed by its experts in the \"but for\" scenario.422\n\n*See* **BD-034**, p. 8; and BRG First Expert Report, \u00b6 136. Previously, the applicable rate, as set by Resolution 14, was the *Tasa Activa de Cartera General para Operaciones Diversas from Banco de la Naci\u00f3n,* BD-032. Note that this seems to be a daily rate.\n\nThe \"but for\" calculations appear to have been made on the basis of a so-called \"synthetic\" cost of debt from December 2005 to August 2014 at a rate of 10.39% pre-tax on average. *See* Respondent's Closing Statement, slide 199. However, this does not clarify the issue.\n\n420.\n\nThe *Hochtief* tribunal held that the terms of the Financial Assistance Loan, as ultimately set by Resolution 14, were a violation of FET.423 While this Tribunal has deemed it unnecessary to make such a finding given the differences between the two claims, it has found that the Financial Assistance Loan, as its terms were ultimately set by Resolution 14, at a minimum exacerbated Puentes' financial situation and made timely restoration of the economic equilibrium of the Contract even more necessary.424\n\n**CL-0013,** *Hochtief*, Decision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6 263-265.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 366-368 *supra.*\n\n421.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore considers that a reduction of the rate on the Financial Assistance Loan once the emergency had ended and the Contract's financial equilibrium restored is logical and reasonable, more so if supported by the 2006 LOU. The Claimant should confirm the assumed rate of interest in the \"but for\" scenario, and that it conforms to the provisions of Section 9 of the 2006 LOU. Assuming the rates used conform to this provision, the Tribunal sees no need for new calculations. If not, a new calculation shall be performed based on the terms of the 2006 LOU.\n\n*(b) Reduction of Interest Rate on Shareholder Loans and Amount of Shareholder Loans in \"But For\"*\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n422.\n\nThe Respondent disputes the reduction in the Claimant's experts' \"but for\" calculations of the interest rate charged by Webuild and Hochtief, the two largest Puentes shareholders, on Shareholder Loans to Puentes after Argentina ceased making further advances to Puentes against the FAL.425 Webuild alone made approximately US$ 3.5 million in Shareholder Loans to Puentes in 2003. The interest rate on its Shareholder Loans and the Loans from *Hochtief* was 15%.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 374-377 *supra.*\n\n423.\n\nThe Claimant's response to this criticism appears to be that in the \"but for\" scenario, once economic equilibrium had been restored and the toll rates had been increased, the uncertainty surrounding the Project's financial viability would have been reduced, and other financing would have been available, enabling Puentes to rely less on shareholder financing (or at least be able to compel shareholders to reduce their interest rates).426 Its experts' calculations demonstrate that a reduction of the rate increases the equity claim but reduces the debt claim in the DCF analysis, resulting in an overall reduction of the value of Webuild's equity stake in Puentes by approximately US$ 23 million.427 (It should be noted that the Tribunal suspects that the word \"increase\" in paragraph 140 should be \"decrease\", based on Table 8 that shows a reduction with the new interest rate of \"Total Damages to Salini Impregilo\" from US$ 198.0 to 174.2, a reduction which corresponds to the 12.4% figure in that paragraph.)\n\n*See* BRG Second Report, \u00b6 140.\n\nBRG Second Report, \u00b6 140; *see also* Table 8 (**BD-115**).\n\n424.\n\nGiven the Tribunal's decision on admissibility of the Webuild Shareholder Loan claims,428 this change would therefore appear to benefit Argentina. It also appears to the Tribunal to be logical and reasonable.\n\n*See* \u00b6 211 *supra*.\n\n425.\n\nThe Respondent's expert also submitted that there would be more Shareholder Loans in the \"but for\" scenario than the Claimant's experts have posited.429 The Claimant considers this to be economically irrational.430\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 613.f.\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 371-372; Claimant's Opening Statement, slide 123.\n\n426.\n\nGiven that the \"but for\" scenario is premised on the economic equilibrium having been restored after the end of the emergency, and that the Project was completed and operational, it is reasonable in the Tribunal's view to assume that to the extent the Project had borrowing needs, it would be able to look to commercial markets to fulfill those needs. Moreover, the Project already had significant debt by virtue of the Financial Assistance Loan and the Shareholder Loans. The history of the Project indicates to the Tribunal that Shareholder Loans were viewed as a last resort. Not all shareholders of Puentes were apparently willing or able to make such loans, with the result that the two largest shareholders were compelled to do so in order to complete the Project. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that an assumption of no further Shareholder Loans is reasonable.\n\n*(c) Other Issues*\n------------------\n\n427.\n\nThe Respondent has alleged that the Claimant's expense calculation contains additional errors: 1) use of inapplicable indices from Decree No. 1295/02 to update expenses; and 2) an error in estimating operating expenses for 2014 by not annualizing administrative expenses, which error was carried over into subsequent years to the end of the Concession Contract.431\n\nRespondent's Rejoinder, \u00b6 615; Respondent's Opening Statement, slide 158.\n\n428.\n\nThe Respondent has not quantified the impact of these errors and, as they appear only to have been raised at the time of the Rejoinder, the Claimant did not have an opportunity to respond in a submission.\n\n429.\n\nPresumably had the economic impact of these items been significant, the Respondent would not only have raised its concerns in its Rejoinder, but would have quantified their impact, as it did with other issues. In any event the issues raised by the Respondent are not sufficiently clear for the Tribunal to evaluate them, and the Tribunal considers that they are not sustained.\n\n*(iii) Discount Rate*\n---------------------\n\n430.\n\nThe Claimant's \"but for\" calculations use the same rate, its Weighted Average Cost of Capital, or WACC, both to update historical losses of Puentes as of the Valuation Date and to discount future losses.432 The Respondent takes issue with the use of the WACC for both sets of losses. It argues that the same rate should not be used for both: that future flows should be discounted by the cost of equity; and historical flows should be updated applying a risk-free rate (one-year U.S. Treasury bills is proposed) as they carry no associated risk.433\n\nBRG Second Report, \u00b6 61 (\"In our First Report, we estimated the WACC ranging between 9.3% and 13.6% for 2006-2013 and at 8.9% as of September 2014.\").\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 613.h; *see also* UTDT Second Report, \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.\n\n431.\n\nThe Claimant in response has submitted that the same risk-adjusted rate should be used for both; otherwise, the result would be the unjust enrichment of the Respondent.434\n\nClaimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 374-383; *see* Claimant's Opening Statement, slide 125.\n\n432.\n\nThe Tribunal considers valid Argentina's position that the risk profile of historical losses is different from future losses, and further considers that a risk-free rate for such losses is more appropriate than a risk-adjusted rate. It also agrees with the Claimant, however, that care must be taken to avoid unjust enrichment of the Respondent through the application of a risk-free rate to historical losses that is not appropriate.435 Moreover, the Claimant is correct that Article 5 of the BIT provides for a normal commercial rate of interest for lawful expropriations. It would therefore be anomalous in the Tribunal's view to provide for an interest rate for an FET violation, an unlawful act, that is lower than the BIT prescribes for a lawful act. A \"normal commercial rate of interest\" in the Tribunal's view does not mandate a WACC, however. The Tribunal invites further submissions from the Parties as to what a non-risk-based normal commercial rate around the Valuation Date in 2014 would have been.\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 344; Claimant's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 326, 373-379, 385-387.\n\n433.\n\nAs for the discount rate for future cash flows, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that this should be a risk-weighted rate. In its view, given the methodology being followed (free cash flow to firm), and the fact that cash flows to Puentes would be used to pay both creditors and shareholders, the Tribunal does not consider that the cost of equity is as suitable a measure as the WACC, which takes into account the cost of debt as well as the cost of equity. It therefore would apply the WACC calculated by the Claimant's experts for the relevant period.\n\n434.\n\nA final issue that has been raised by Respondent is the risk of double recovery. As the Tribunal has already observed in its Decision on Jurisdiction, this issue can be managed.436 To do so, however, requires that the Tribunal be provided with current information on the status of any recovery of Puentes from the domestic proceedings to date. The Tribunal therefore requests that Claimant provide it with such information.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 173.\n\n**D. Compound Pre- and Post-Award Interest**\n--------------------------------------------\n\n**(1) The Parties' Positions**\n------------------------------\n\n***a. The Claimant's Position***\n--------------------------------\n\n435.\n\nThe Claimant requests an award of pre-award and post-award interest from 31 August 2014 until the date Argentina pays in full, at the highest possible lawful rate, such as Argentina's borrowing rate or another rate that the Tribunal may deem appropriate to the circumstances of the case.437 Further, the Claimant seeks that any award of interest granted by this Tribunal be compounded on an annual basis.438\n\nClaimant's Memorial, \u00b6 338.\n\n*Ibid.*, \u00b6\u00b6 339-346.\n\n***b. The Respondent's Position***\n----------------------------------\n\n436.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the Claimant's request for capitalization of interest should be rejected and the amount of a potential capitalization should be adjusted using a risk-free rate.439 The Respondent also argues that Argentine law's asserted prohibition on capitalization of interest precludes any compounding.440\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6\u00b6 619-630.\n\nRespondent's Counter-Memorial, \u00b6 624.\n\n**(2) The Tribunal's Analysis**\n-------------------------------\n\n437.\n\nThe Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that annual compounding is appropriate and that compounding in general is consistent with many recent decisions of investment tribunals. Moreover, although Article 5 of the BIT, prescribing a commercial rate of interest, does not apply *strictu sensu*, it stands to reason that if that is the BIT's standard for lawful expropriations, a similar standard should apply for treaty violations. While the BIT deals with rates and not the issue of compounding, the reference to \"commercial\" suggests that compounding, which is common commercially, is consistent with that term. Capitalization of interest is not at issue; indeed, the Tribunal recalls that the FAL terms as fixed by Resolution 14 featured daily compounding of interest.\n\n**VII. ECISIONS AND FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS**\n------------------------------------------\n\n**A. Decisions**\n----------------\n\n438.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:\n\n(1) Webuild's claims with respect to its Shareholder Loans are admissible;\n\n(2) Argentina has violated Article 2.2 of the BIT, first sentence, the obligation to give fair and equitable treatment to investments covered by the BIT, through its failure by September 2006, after the end of the economic emergency, to reestablish the economic equilibrium of the Concession as required by the Concession Contract and the Emergency Law;\n\n(3) Argentina has also violated Article 2.2 of the BIT, second sentence, by its unjustified conduct in failing to reestablish the economic equilibrium of the Concession within a reasonable time after the end of the economic emergency;\n\n(4) In light of the Tribunal's decision relating to Article 2.2 (first and second sentences), no decision needs be reached by the Tribunal on the discrimination claims raised by the Claimant under Articles 2.2, 3 and 4, or the expropriation claim raised by the Claimant under Article 5, of the BIT;\n\n(5) Argentina's defense of necessity is denied;\n\n(6) With respect to damages as a consequence of the breaches noted above, no final decision on the quantum of damages and interest to be awarded is made at this time, with such decision being deferred to the final Award following further submissions of the Parties on the questions set forth in subsection B of this section and further deliberations of the Tribunal. The Tribunal has determined that the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard of full reparation, using an income method, calculated on the basis of free cash flow to the firm, shall be used to calculate damages, including historical damages from September 2006 to the Valuation Date of 31 August 2014, and future damages from that date to the end of the Concession; and,\n\n(7) The Tribunal reserves any decision on costs for the Award in these proceedings.\n\n**B. Further Instructions and Questions**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n439.\n\nThe Tribunal instructs the Parties (or a Party, as indicated) to prepare revised calculations of damages consistent with its decision set forth in Section VII.A on the following basis:\n\na. *Toll Rates.* Initial toll rates should correspond to those set forth in the 2006 LOU, which by its terms was aimed at a partial restoration of the Concession's equilibrium. Readjustment of rates after the initial period set by the 2006 LOU shall be done on an annual basis consistent with the indices and 5% threshold specified in that LOU (based on paragraph 390 above).\n\nb. *Toll Subsidy.* The revised calculations of damages shall include a figure showing the impact of termination of any toll subsidy included in the 2006 LOU after 2012 versus the continuation of such subsidy until the end of the Concession (based on paragraphs 393 to 396 above).\n\nc. *Elasticities.* The revised calculation of damages should be based on three different assumptions regarding elasticity values: one at the low end of the envelope of values put forward by Mr. Bates in the *Hochtief* Arbitration; one at the high end; and one at the midpoint. Given the Tribunal's finding of greater inelasticity of demand for heavy rather than light traffic, the values in each calculation should reflect this differential, using the same degree of differential as reflected in Table 9 set forth in paragraph 399 above.\n\nd. *Rate of Return.* The Claimant is also requested to clarify to what extent, if any, future cash flows in any calculation of damages are based on an IRR in excess of 8.87% and, to the extent that may be the case, to provide an additional calculation based on an IRR of no greater than 8.87%, along with a calculation using an IRR of 9.18% (or such other rate as may result from the new calculation of damages requested by this Decision), taking into account any variations caused by actual performance), so that the effect of any higher rate that the Claimant's experts consider historical performance may justify is clear, as set out in paragraphs 406 to 413 above.\n\ne. *Working Capital: Current vs. Non-Current Assets and Duration of Tax Credit Carryover.* The Parties are requested to clarify the position regarding tax credit carryovers, as set forth in paragraphs 414 to 416 above. If such carryovers are limited in duration to five years under Argentine law, the revised calculations of damages shall be consistent with that limitation.\n\nf. *Rate of Interest on the FAL.* To enable the Tribunal better to understand the treatment of the interest rate on the FAL in the \"but for\" scenario, the Claimant is requested to confirm specifically the assumed rate of interest on the Financial Assistance Loan in that scenario. The Parties are also requested to confirm the Interest Rate for Loans to Leading Companies in the 25th percentile as published by the Argentine Central Bank, as referenced in Section 9 of the 2006 LOU. Assuming the 2006 LOU provisions have been correctly applied, the FAL rate reduction shall be unchanged from the earlier calculations performed by Claimant's experts. If, however, that rate has not been correctly applied, a new calculation shall be performed using the correct rate based on the 2006 LOU (paragraphs 417 to 421 above).\n\ng. *Rate of Interest on Shareholder Loans and Additional Shareholder Loans.* The assumed rate of interest on shareholder loans (including the Shareholder Loans) shall be unchanged from the earlier calculations performed by those experts. No additional shareholder loans shall be assumed to have been made in the \"but for\" scenario (paragraphs 422 to 426 above).\n\nh. *Effect of Debt Overhang from Pre-Operation Phase.* The Claimant is requested to clarify the extent to which, if any, in the \"but for\" scenario there existed a debt overhang from the construction phase (whether to subcontractors such as Boskalis-Ballast, shareholders or Argentina under the FAL) that would presumably not have been present absent the cancellation of the IDB Loan and the effects of the economic emergency on Puentes' ability to retire such debt, and the impact any such overhang might have on the revenues Puentes would be required to earn in order to achieve the targeted IRR in that scenario (paragraph 368 above).\n\ni. *Other.* Except as set forth herein, all other assumptions in the calculation of damages in the \"but for\" scenario shall remain unchanged.\n\nj. *Interest Rate on Historical Losses.* Historical losses are to be calculated using a risk-free standard commercial rate of interest on or around the Valuation Date. The Tribunal invites further submissions from the Parties as to what a non-risk-based normal commercial rate around the Valuation Date in 2014 would have been. A short-term instrument such as a one-year U.S. Treasury bill would appear to be inapposite for a long-term investment and in light of the standard of a commercial rate of interest; the Parties should therefore consider rates based on instruments of longer tenor, *e.g.*, five or ten years. Alternative calculations should be provided using the chosen rates (paragraph 432 above).\n\nk. *Discount Rate for Future Losses.* The discount rate for future projected losses shall continue to be the WACC (paragraph 433 above).\n\nl. *Compounding.* Interest shall be compounded annually (paragraph 437 above).\n\n440.\n\nIn addition: the Tribunal requests answers to the following questions from the Parties or a Party, as indicated:\n\na. *Current Legal Status of Puentes.* The Claimant is invited to clarify the current status of Puentes, including whether its dissolution is complete, and if so, the date on which that dissolution occurred. If any liquidating distributions were made to shareholders, these should be identified, by shareholder. The Claimant and the Respondent are also invited to provide information on the current status of the two domestic court cases pending at the time of the submissions in this case.\n\nb. *Subcontractor and Other Repayments.* The Claimant is also invited to confirm: (1) that all subcontractors are fully repaid in its \"but for\" scenario, and to specify the timing of such repayment(s); and (2) to provide current information regarding any repayments of Shareholder Loans (including to Webuild) or third parties, including but not limited to subcontractors, that have been made pursuant to the reorganization plan, to the extent the record is not up to date, or to confirm that the record fully reflects such repayments.\n\nc. *Effect of Reduction of Interest Rate on Shareholder Loans.* The Claimant is requested to confirm that the Tribunal's reading of paragraph 140 of the Second BRG Report is correct in considering that the word \"increase\" should be \"decrease\" (and if not, to clarify the position on the issue discussed in paragraphs 422-426 above).\n\nd. *Double Recovery Issues.* To avoid double recovery, the Claimant is also requested to confirm the status of any recovery it or its shareholders have received from any claims it has pursued in Argentine courts, and to indicate the status of any such proceedings.\n\n441.\n\nThe Respondent is requested to provide any information that the Claimant may reasonably require to respond to the Tribunal's requests. The Parties are encouraged to work together to provide joint or agreed responses to these questions to the extent possible.\n\n442.\n\nThe Parties are encouraged to provide their responses to the above requests within sixty (60) days of this Decision via a joint submission. Alternatively, if the calculations are not agreed, the Parties shall note any areas of disagreement in their joint submission, or make separate simultaneous submissions."}, {"Title": "Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration", "Type": "Supplementary", "Date": "2024-09-25T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n**Table of Abbreviations/Defined Terms**\n----------------------------------------\n\nExcept for the terms defined below, or otherwise indicated in this Decision, all other terms defined in the Decision on Liability and Directions on Quantum and used herein shall have the same meaning ascribed to them therein.\n\n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| Arbitration Rules | ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings of 2006 |\n| Argentina or the Respondent | The Argentine Republic |\n| BIT or the Treaty | Agreement between the Argentine Republic and the Republic of Italy on the Promotion and Protection of Investments which was signed on 22 May 1990 and entered into force on 14 October 1993 |\n| Claimant | Webuild S.p.A.

INTRODUCTION & PROCEDURAL HISTORY**\n----------------------------------------\n\n1.\n\nOn 3 March 2023 the Arbitral Tribunal issued its Decision on Liability and Directions on Quantum (hereinafter, the \"**Decision on Liability**\"). The Tribunal's main rulings were that:\n\n2.\n\nWebuild's claims with respect to its Shareholder Loans were admissible;\n\n3.\n\nArgentina had violated Article 2.2 of the BIT, first sentence (the obligation to give fair and equitable treatment (\"**FET**\") to investments covered by the BIT), through its failure by September 2006, after the end of the economic emergency, to reestablish the economic equilibrium of the Concession as required by the Concession Contract and the Emergency Law;\n\n4.\n\nArgentina had also violated Article 2.2 of the BIT, second sentence, by its unjustified conduct in failing to reestablish the economic equilibrium of the Concession within a reasonable time after the end of the economic emergency;\n\n5.\n\nIn light of the Tribunal's decision relating to Article 2.2 (first and second sentences), the Tribunal decided that no decision needed to be reached by it on the discrimination claims raised by the Claimant under Articles 2.2, 3 and 4, or the expropriation claim raised by the Claimant under Article 5, of the BIT;\n\n6.\n\nArgentina's defense of necessity was denied;\n\n7.\n\nWith respect to damages as a consequence of the breaches noted above, no final decision on the quantum of damages and interest to be awarded was made at that time, with such decision being deferred to the Award following further submissions of the Parties on the questions set forth under VII(B) of the Decision on Liability and further deliberations of the Tribunal. The Tribunal determined that the *Chorz\u00f3w Factory* standard of full reparation, using an income method, calculated on the basis of free cash flow to the firm, shall be used to calculate damages, including historical damages from September 2006 to the Valuation Date of 31 August 2014, and future damages from that date to the end of the Concession; and,\n\n8.\n\nThe Tribunal reserved any decision on costs for the Award in these proceedings.1\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 438.\n\n9.\n\nOn 9 June 2023, each Party filed a submission in response to the Tribunal's questions and instructions in the Decision on Liability.\n\n10.\n\nOn 18 April 2024, the Tribunal informed the Parties that while it was in the process of drafting its Award, and having deliberations on the same, the Tribunal would find it useful to have the Claimant's comments on the Respondent's requests in its 9 June 2023 submission concerning the local proceedings in connection with the risk of double recovery under paragraph 117(c), (d), (e), and (f) of that submission. The Claimant was requested to file this submission by 26 April 2024.\n\n11.\n\nAlso on 18 April 2024, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to respond to the Claimant's comments on the matter concerning the risk of double recovery.\n\n12.\n\nOn 19 April 2024, the Tribunal granted leave to the Respondent to reply to the Claimant's comments by 7 May 2024, giving the Claimant the opportunity to respond, if it so wished, to the Respondent's reply by 15 May 2024.\n\n13.\n\nAs scheduled, (i) on 26 April 2024, the Claimant filed its comments on the Respondent's requests concerning the local proceedings in connection with the risk of double recovery under paragraph 117(c), (d), (e), and (f) of the Respondent's submission of 9 June 2023; and (ii) on 7 May 2024, the Respondent filed its response. Subsequently, on 10 May 2024, the Claimant filed further comments on the matter.\n\n14.\n\nOn 21 May 2024, the Tribunal invited the Parties to file short submissions on costs, updating the ones of 12 March 2021, by 31 May 2024.\n\n15.\n\nOn 31 May 2024, each Party filed an updated statement of costs.\n\n16.\n\nOn 1 July 2024, the Respondent filed a request for the admissibility of new evidence: a judgment rendered on 27 June 2024 by the Federal Court on Administrative-Contentious Matters No. 8 of the Argentine Republic in the local proceeding entitled \"Puentes del Litoral S.A. c/Ministerio de Planificaci\u00f3n s/Proceso de Conocimiento\" (the \"**PdL Case**\") (the \"**PdL Judgment**\" or \"**Local Judgment**\"), which according to Argentina, constituted a \"new and relevant fact\". The Respondent requested that the Tribunal provide an opportunity for the Parties to file simultaneous submissions on the impact of the PdL Judgment in this arbitration proceeding.\n\n17.\n\nOn 2 July 2024, the Claimant objected to the Respondent's request, but stated that if the Tribunal was to permit the incorporation of the PdL Judgment, the Tribunal should then allow the Respondent to file a short submission, to be followed by the Claimant's response, with no further submissions.\n\n18.\n\nOn the same date, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would allow one round of submissions: the Respondent was to file a copy of the PdL Judgment together with a submission not to exceed 10 pages, by 9 July 2024, and the Claimant, if it so wished, was to file a response with the same page limit by 16 July 2024. By communication of the same date, the Respondent stated that it reserved its rights to request an opportunity to file observations on the Claimant's response. Subsequently, at the Parties' request, the Tribunal extended those deadlines by one day, in light of a national holiday in Argentina.\n\n19.\n\nAccordingly, on 10 July 2024, the Respondent filed a submission on the PdL Judgment's impact in this arbitration, together with the PdL Judgment, as Exhibit **A RA-0645**, and Legal Authorities **AL RA-059, AL RA-0201**, **AL RA-0398**, and **AL RA-0405** to **AL RA-0411**. The Respondent's submission, styled \"Argentine Republic's Submission on the Implications of the PdL Judgment\", included a request on the basis of the PdL Judgment for the Tribunal to revise its Decision on Liability (the \"**Request for Reconsideration**\").\n\n20.\n\nOn 11 July 2024, the Claimant called the Tribunal's attention to the fact that the Respondent had actually filed a Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Liability, instead of a submission that discussed the implications of the PdL Judgment as a new and relevant fact, as the Respondent had originally requested. In light of this, the Claimant requested leave from the Tribunal to file its response by 19 July 2024, instead of by 17 July 2024. On the same date, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the Claimant's request.\n\n21.\n\nOn 12 July 2024, the Respondent noted that it did not object to the Tribunal granting such an extension, but that it would in turn request the opportunity to respond to the Claimant's arguments. Subsequently, the Claimant filed an objection to the Respondent's request. On the same date, and after considering the Parties' communications, the Tribunal granted the Claimant's extension request for the filing of its response until 19 July 2024.\n\n22.\n\nOn 16 July 2024, the Respondent circulated an English translation of its Request for Reconsideration and the PdL Judgment.\n\n23.\n\nOn 19 July 2024, the Claimant filed a response to the Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, styled \"Claimant's Response to the Argentine Republic's Request for Reconsideration of the Decision on Liability,\" together with Exhibits **C-0461** to **C-0463** in English and Spanish and Legal Authorities **CL-0254** to **CL-0260** (the \"**Claimant's Response**\").\n\n24.\n\nOn 23 July 2024, having considered the Parties' positions, and after due deliberation, the Tribunal notified the Parties of its decision to authorize a second round of sequential submissions, and provided its instructions to such effect. The Respondent's submission would be due by 31 July 2024, and the Claimant's by 7 August 2024.\n\n25.\n\nAs scheduled, on 31 July 2024, the Respondent filed its reply on the Request for Reconsideration, styled \"Reply of the Argentine Republic on the Implications of the Judgment in the PdL Case (the \"**Respondent's Reply**\"), with the English version following on 6 August 2024.\n\n26.\n\nOn 7 August 2024, the Claimant filed the rejoinder to Argentina's Reply, styled \"Claimant's Surrebuttal to the Argentine Republic's Request for Reconsideration of the Decision on Liability\" (the \"**Claimant's Surrebuttal**\").\n\n**II. THE PARTIES' POSITIONS**\n------------------------------\n\n**A. Respondent's Position**\n----------------------------\n\n27.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Liability based on the the PdL Judgment, a judgment issued by the Federal Court in Administrative-Contentious Matters No. 8 of the Judiciary Branch of the Argentine Republic on 27 June 2024.\n\n28.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the PdL Judgment (i) deals with the same facts at issue in this arbitration proceeding; (ii) involves the Claimant, who participated as an interested third party in the PdL Case given the close connection between the claims made in this arbitration proceeding to those made in the judicial proceeding; and (iii) confirms \"that Argentina acted lawfully with respect to the financial problems of Puentes del Litoral (\"**PdL**\" or \"**Concessionaire**\") [\u2026] during the Concession, and that the termination of PdL's Concession Contract due to the Concessionaire's fault, as provided in the Concession Contract, complied with the requirements of legality and due process.\"2\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 2.\n\n29.\n\nIn the first place, the Respondent explains what it considers to be the impact of the PdL Judgment in this arbitration proceeding based on the different outcomes in the Decision on Liability and the Local Judgment despite the similarities between them.\n\n30.\n\n*First*, the Respondent notes that the similarity of the claims was asserted by the Claimant at the jurisdictional stage of this proceeding, which was further acknowledged by the Tribunal when it determined \"that since the claims brought by PdL in local jurisdiction were substantially similar to Webuild's claim in the arbitration, the BIT's requirements for establishing arbitral jurisdiction had been met.\"3\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.\n\n31.\n\nIn line with this, the Respondent rejects the Claimant's new position that the PdL Case and this proceeding \"maintain fundamental differences\".4 According to the Respondent, the \"Claimant cannot seek to benefit from the similarity of the PdL Case and this arbitration for purposes of arguing that it met the jurisdictional requirements [\u2026] and, at the same time, deny that similarity in attempt to minimize the implications of the PdL Case Judgment.\"5\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 9; citing Claimant's Response, \u00b6 18.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 10.\n\n32.\n\n*Second*, the Respondent argues that both claims are \"substantially similar\" as they relate to the same Concession Contract and sovereign acts by Argentina,6 they faced the same facts,7 and involved Webuild. Delving into the participation of Webuild in the PdL Case, the Respondent states that Webuild (i) was cited by the judge in the PdL Case as an interested third party due to its shareholder status; (ii) made a filing in the PdL Case; but (iii) failed to file evidence or invoke any rights, despite having been given the opportunity to do so.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 3; citing Decision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 134 (\"The dispute submitted to Argentine forums by Puentes shared substantially similar facts with the BIT claim subsequently submitted to arbitration by Salini Impregilo. Both related to the same Concession Contract and the same sovereign acts by Argentina.\")\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 12.\n\n33.\n\nThe Respondent notes that despite the similarities previously detailed, this Tribunal reached a \"decision entirely contradictory to the ruling on the PdL Case.\"8 Argentina explains that the contradictions between the decisions are as follows.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 6.\n\n34.\n\n**PdL's financial debacle**: according to the Respondent, this Tribunal decided that the Emergency Law, together with other measures, \"were the cause of PdL's financial debacle\" and found \"irrelevant\" the \"problems arising from PdL's failure to obtain financing\". On the other hand, the Local Judgment concluded that \"PdL's financial difficulties were caused by the failure to obtain financing in a timely manner, which was a cause for termination of the Concession Contract.\"9\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.\n\n35.\n\nThe Respondent adds that the *Hochtief v. Argentina* tribunal dealt with the same facts of this arbitration proceeding and found that PdL \"faced serious financial difficulties prior to the emergency measures\" due to its failure to obtain firm and irrevocable financing within the timeframe established in the Concession Contract and its indebtedness to its main subcontractor, which triggered PdL's reorganization proceedings.10 Making reference to the Claimant's allegations that Argentina \"overstates the similarity between the cases\", and that this Tribunal had witness statements not available in *Hochtief* or the PdL Case and broader witness statements, the Respondent clarifies the following:\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 13, citing *Hochtief AG v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/31, Decision on Liability, 29 December 2014 (\"***Hochtief*** **Decision**\"), \u00b6\u00b6253-258, **AL RA-59**.\n\n36.\n\nRegarding witnesses: (i) witness Mr. Villagi filed a witness statement, provided live testimony and was cross-examined during the Hearing on the Merits of this case, and also provided testimony in the *Hochtief* arbitration and the PdL Case; (ii) it is untrue that witnesses Mr. Bes and Mr. Lommatzsch provided different testimonies in *Hochtief* and this proceeding; (iii) none of the witnesses who testified in this arbitration, but not in the PdL Case, \"addressed issues that were not already covered.\"11\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 13.\n\n37.\n\nWith reference to the documentary evidence, the Respondent states that the \"Claimant misrepresents the content of the documents it mentions, and in some cases invents quotes, in order to force the alleged contradiction\"12 and that without any support the Claimant qualifies the PdL Judgment as a \"gross incompetence and judicial impropriety.\"13\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 15, where Respondent refers to an alleged misrepresentation of the Memorandum of Agreement dated 20 October 2000, UNIREN's Report dated 19 January 2007, the Second Letter of Understanding, a court decision in PdL's reorganization proceeding, and a transcript of the 2011 Public Hearings.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 15.\n\n38.\n\n**Unlawful termination of the Concession Contract**: Argentina alleges that this Tribunal found \"the termination of the Concession Contract was unjust and attributable to Claimant's conduct and, therefore, considered it a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard\",14 but the PdL Judgment established that \"the State respected the due process and the termination was the only permitted alternative\",15 considering that PdL was dissolved, which was a cause of termination of the Concession Contract pursuant to the Terms and Conditions of the bidding process.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 10.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 11.\n\n39.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the Federal Court on Administrative-Contentious Matters No. 8 issued the PdL Judgment based on Argentine law and acted as the \"competent court in connection with a contract governed by Argentine law regarding its performance and termination.\"16 Accordingly, Argentina argues that the Tribunal \"should asses the application of Argentine law in light of the findings of the local Judgment\",17 because otherwise, by failing to apply the municipal law, the Tribunal would be \"exceeding its powers, and its decision would be subject to annulment under the terms of Article 52 of the ICSID Convention.\"18\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 14.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 19.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 19.\n\n40.\n\nFinally, the Respondent relies on *Azinian v. Mexico*,19 *SAUR v. Argentina*,20 and *Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil v. Colombia*21 to determine that \"a public authority cannot be faulted for acting in a manner that has been validated by its courts\".22 The Respondent further asserts that as Webuild's legitimate expectations were determined to be grounded in the Concession Contract, Webuild's legitimate expectations under the BIT \"could not consist in the State acting contrary to the law governing the Concession Contract.\"23\n\n*Robert Azinian, Kenneth Davitian & Ellen Baca v.

Colombia,* ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/16/5, Award, 7 May 2021, \u00b6 333, **AL RA-405**.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 7.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 14.\n\n41.\n\nThe Respondent defends the application of *Azinian* despite such case dealing with a claim of expropriation and notes that the tribunal considered \"that a local judgment does not preclude the possibility of a breach of a standard of treatment if the local judgment is clearly incompatible with a rule of international law or there is a denial of justice.\"24 Argentina further explains that the Claimant does not rebut the fact that \"it cannot be concluded that the State breached the treaty by terminating a concession contract if the public authority declared the termination of the contract [\u2026] and the local courts confirm the public authority's decision,\"25 which happened in this case.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 7; citing Claimant's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 27 and 28.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6 7.\n\n42.\n\n*Third*, the Respondent alleges that this Tribunal has already relied on a local judicial decision, namely the 2008 ruling of the Argentine Commercial Court towards PdL's reorganization proceeding, when ruling on Argentina's liability. Thus, it explains that the Tribunal should consider the PdL Judgment as a *decisive factor* in this instance \"since it was issued by the forum specialized in the interpretation and application of the specific Argentine law.\"26\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 20.\n\n43.\n\nIn the second place, Argentina analyses the Tribunal's power to review the Decision on Liability under the ICSID Convention, and ICSID case law, and concludes that the Tribunal can and should review its Decision on Liability.\n\n44.\n\n*First*, Argentina explains that pursuant to Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal can review the Decision on Liability considering that this Article \"empower[s] arbitral tribunals to determine their own jurisdiction\".27 It adds that Article 44 of the Convention grants the Tribunal the power to \"decide any procedural question not provided for by the ICSID Convention, the Arbitration Rules or the applicable procedural rules.\"28 Furthermore, Argentina states that \"the revision of a pre-award decision is possible in situations analogous to those provided for in Article 51 of the ICSID Convention\"29 based on \"the ground of discovery of some facts of such a nature as decisively to affect the award, provided that when the award was rendered that fact was unknown to the Tribunal and to the applicant.\"30\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 23.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 21.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 22.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 22.\n\n45.\n\n*Second*, the Respondent relies on other ICSID tribunals' decisions to determine that the Tribunal has the power to reopen the Decision on Liability. Argentina explains that in *Cavalum v. Spain*, the tribunal confirmed that the power to reopen a pre-award decision arises from Article 44 of the ICSID Convention and such power may be exercised \"when reasons of judicial and arbitral integrity so require.\"31 In *Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania,* the tribunal found that Articles 41(1) and 44 of the ICSID Convention empowered tribunals to reopen [a decision] in certain limited circumstances. Argentina explains that in *Standard Chartered* the tribunal noted that the decision to reopen a decision (i) \"has practical advantages\"; (ii) \"should be guided by, although, not bound by, the limitations on reopening that apply to awards\"; and (iii) \"must at least extend to the grounds for reopening an award in Article 51.\"32\n\n*Cavalum SGPS, S.A. v. Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/34, Decision on the Kingdom of Spain's Request for Reconsideration*,* 10 January 2022, (\"***Cavalum***\"), \u00b6\u00b6 65, 71, **AL RA-406**.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 23; citing *Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited v.

Spain* the tribunal found that \"ICSID tribunals have the authority to re-examine a decision when some fact of decisive importance is discovered on a point already decided.\" It argues as well that the tribunal in that case also determined that (i) \"a new decision of a tribunal could be considered a 'fact'\"; (ii) that this decision constituted a *newly discovered fact* if it was unknown to the tribunal and the party seeking review; and (iii) it should be established if the new decision constituted or not \"an outcome-determinative legal development.\"33 Furthermore, the Respondent argues that the PdL Judgment is a *newly discovered fact* \"since it did not exist at the time the Decision on Liability was issued\", thus \"it was unknown to the Tribunal and the Respondent\", and that it constitutes an outcome-determinative legal development since \"it was issued by a Court with jurisdiction regarding the Concession Contract governed by Argentine law, which is part of the law applicable in the present arbitration.\"34\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 24; citing *Infracapital F1 S.\u00e0 r.l. and Infracapital Solar B.V. v. Spain*, ICSID Case No. ARB/16/18, Decision on Respondent's Second Request for Reconsideration, 19 August 2022, \u00b6\u00b6 33, 36, 37, 90, **AL RA-411**; *Infracapital F1 S.\u00e0 r.l. and Infracapital Solar B.V. v.

Argentina explains that both *Landesbank v. Spain* and *Cavalum v. Spain* established that \"a subsequent legal authority is not enough by itself to warrant reconsideration, but it must be a decisive legal authority.\"35 Argentina insists that the PdL Judgment fulfils the standard.\n\nRespondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 6-7, citing *Landesbank Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, et. al v Spain,* ICSID Case No. ARB/15/45, Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, 22 February 2023, (\"***Landesbank***\"), **CL-255**; and *Cavalum*, \u00b6\u00b6 80-81, **AL RA 406**.\n\n48.\n\nTo conclude, Argentina requests that the Tribunal reconsider and revise the Decision on Liability, taking into account that the PdL Judgment is not only a persuasive but a determinative element since it (i) was issued by a court of the jurisdiction specialized in the interpretation and application of the specific Argentine law governing the Concession Contract; (ii) analysed the same facts as have been considered in this proceeding; and (iii) involved the same parties.36\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6\u00b6 20, 25, 26. Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21.\n\n**B. Claimant's Position**\n--------------------------\n\n49.\n\nThe Claimant rejects the Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Liability, and rebuts the Respondent's arguments as follows.\n\n50.\n\nIn the first place, the Claimant states that the Decision on Liability is *res judicata* and binding on the Parties; thus, Webuild affirms that the Tribunal owes no deference to the PdL Judgment. Webuild asserts that \"the Decision on Liability represents the Tribunal's decision on issues of fact and law\"37 and bases its conclusion on an International Court of Justice judgment:\n\n[O]nce the Court has made a determination, whether on a matter of the merits of a dispute brought before it, or on a question of its own jurisdiction, that determination is definitive both for the parties to the case, in respect of the case [\u2026] and for the Court itself in the context of that case. [\u2026] For the Court *res judicata pro Veritate habetur*, and the judicial truth within the context of a case is as the Court has determined it [\u2026] This result is required by the nature of the judicial function, and the universally recognized need for stability of legal relations.38\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 4.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b63, citing to *Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v. Serbia and Montenegro*), ICJ Judgment, 26 February 2007, \u00b6\u00b6 139-140, **CL-0254**.\n\n51.\n\nIn the same vein, Webuild relies on other ICSID awards and affirms that \"tribunals have found that a pre-award decision on an issue of fact or law is binding on the parties,\"39 and adds that the Tribunal rendered a decision after eight years of proceedings in which it heard the Parties -including the issues that Argentina \"rehashes in its Request for Reconsideration\"-, analysed the complexities of this case not present in other concessions,40 and took into account the totality of the facts and evidence in the case.41\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 3, relying on *Standard Chartered*, **AL RA-408**, *Cavalum*, **AL RA-406**; *Landesbank*, \u00b6 36, **CL-0255**; *Waste Management Inc. v.

Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, 10 March 2014, \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, **CL-0257**.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 4.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 13; Claimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 14.\n\n52.\n\nAccordingly, Webuild affirms that \"the Tribunal is far from being an outlier in terms of its legal and factual analysis as the Argentine Republic suggests.\"42 The Claimant further alleges that Argentina overstates the relevance of the PdL Judgment and the *Hochtief* Decision on liability because \"the Tribunal here had available to it the benefit of witness and expert testimony not available in either the *Hochtief* arbitration nor in Puentes del Litoral's lawsuit and [is] free to carry out its own independent analysis.\"43\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 4.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 6.\n\n53.\n\nAlso, the Claimant in its Surrebuttal addresses the clarifications made by the Respondent regarding witnesses and documentary evidence filed in this case:\n\n54.\n\nWebuild explains that Mr. Bes' testimony within this arbitration \"did not analyze or could not really testify as to the IDB's reasons why disbursements were not made, a fact he did not admit in the *Hochtief* arbitration.\"44\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 17.\n\n55.\n\nMr. Lamdany, not Mr. Villagi, was unavailable to participate in the Hearing on the Merits, however, the latter did render additional testimony in this proceeding regarding UNIREN reports.45\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 18-20.\n\n56.\n\nTherefore, Webuild concludes that the \"Tribunal's decision is conclusive and leaves no room for reconsideration\" as it \"represents the Tribunal's final conclusions of law and fact as to liability and is binding on the Parties and the Tribunal.\"46\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 6.\n\n57.\n\nFinally, Webuild expressly states that it disagrees with the Respondent's assertion that the Parties \"generally agree that an arbitral tribunal may revise its pre-award decisions.\" On the contrary, the Claimant emphasizes that Decision on Liability is *res judicata*47 and that \"local law cannot rehabilitate the Argentine Republic's international liability\"48 considering that the obligations acquired under the BIT \"go beyond mere contractual breaches even if the factual basis of the two types of claims may to a large extent coincide.\"49\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 2.\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 4.\n\n*Impregilo S.p.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/17, Award, 21 June 2011 \u00b6 182, **CL-0003**.\n\n58.\n\nIn the second place, the Claimant asserts that the Tribunal does not have the power to reopen and reconsider wholesale the Decision on Liability. According to Webuild such power (i) is not unlimited and is available to reconsider only *some* aspects if (ii) the Tribunal \"did not intend its decision to be final\", and (iii) there are *exceptional* circumstances, which are not present in this case.50\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 7. See Claimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6\u00b6 4-5.\n\n59.\n\nOn the first point, Webuild explains that inasmuch as the ICSID Convention is silent on a tribunal's power to revise prior decisions, arbitral tribunals have taken two opposing pathways towards the powers granted by Article 44 of the Convention. On the one hand, tribunals have rejected the possibility of revisiting previous decisions51, and on the other hand, tribunals have found the power to review decisions is inherent in the conduct of a proceeding.52 Moreover, the Claimant states that \"regardless of the different paths taken, all tribunals agree that an ICSID tribunal cannot reconsider its prior decisions absent limited and exceptional circumstances, nor can the reconsideration be unconstrained.\"53\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 8, where Webuild cites *ConocoPhillips v. Venezuela*, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/30, Decision on Respondent's Request for Reconsideration, 10 March 2014, \u00b6 22, **CL-0257** (\"Article 44 of the ICSID Convention makes explicit the tribunal's power to address procedural issues not dealt with in the Convention or the Rules. [\u2026] It cannot be seen as conferring a broad unexpressed power of substantive decision.\")\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 8; citing *Landesbank*, \u00b6 36, **CL-0255**.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 8.\n\n60.\n\nOn the second aspect, Webuild rebuts Respondent's commentary on *Standard Chartered* and *Cavalum*. The Claimant states that the *Standard Chartered* tribunal decided that \"the decisions made by ICSID tribunals in the course of a case are binding\" and that \"a decision of an ICSID tribunal cannot be considered to be merely a draft that can be reopened at will.\"54 The Claimant asserts that in *Cavalum*, the tribunal held that \"if a decision is made on a preliminary issue of law which is intended to be final, the mere fact that it may have been erroneous may not be a sufficient ground for reopening this decision.\"55\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 9, citing *Standard Chartered*, \u00b6 322, **AL RA-408**.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 10, citing *Cavalum*, \u00b6 75, **AL RA-406**.\n\n61.\n\nFollowing this argument, Webuild affirms that this Tribunal issued both the Decision on Jurisdiction and Decision on Liability as final and binding decisions being \"fully aware that Puentes del Litoral had initiated a lawsuit before a contentious administrative court in Argentina.\"56 The Claimant notes that the Tribunal (i) \"rejected the Argentine Republic's request to stay the arbitration proceeding pending Puentes del Litoral's lawsuit\"; and (ii) \"dismissed the *forum non conveniens* objection.\"57 On the latter point, the Claimant argues that the Tribunal's decision on its Decision on Jurisdiction remains relevant because \"if Puentes del Litoral's contractual lawsuit was not a reason to grant the Argentine Republic's *forum non conveniens* objection, the judgment resulting from that litigation cannot justify reconsideration of the Tribunal's Decision on Liability either.\"58\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 11.\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 7.\n\n62.\n\nBased on these considerations, the Claimant states that the PdL Judgment should not change the Tribunal's analysis as (i) Webuild claims under the BIT are independent and distinct from the contractual claims asserted by Puentes del Litoral in local courts;59 (ii) Webuild appeared in the PdL Case \"against its will and its BIT claims were not subject to that court's jurisdiction\"60; and (iii) it dealt with a different cause of action, was brought by different party, and applied domestic law only. Finally, the Claimant establishes that the Local Judgment has no effect on the Tribunal's determination of liability despite the relation between the causes as \"a state may breach a treaty without breaching a contract\"61 and \"a breach of contract is neither necessary nor a sufficient condition for a breach of treaty.\"62\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 6 (\"There is simply no dependency relation between this ICSID Tribunal's main findings on Webuild's treaty claims, the Republic's international liability, and the domestic decision of an Argentine court regarding Puentes del Litoral's contract claims under Argentine law- they are simply based on different instruments, legal regimes, and standards of treatment.\")\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 11.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal S.A. v. Argentine Republic*, ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3, Award, 20 August 2007, \u00b6 7.3.10, **CL-0009**.\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29, Award, Aug. 27, 2009, \u00b6 139, **CL-0236**.\n\n63.\n\nIn the third place, Webuild alleges the Local Judgment has no effect, either controlling or persuasive, on the Decision on Liability given that it (i) does not provide new evidence; and (ii) the Tribunal owes no deference to the Local Judgment.63\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 14.\n\n64.\n\nBy citing *Landesbank* the Claimant states that the grounds for reconsideration pursuant to Article 51 of the ICSID Convention are narrow, including a new discovered fact of such nature as to decisively affect the outcome if it had been known at the time the decision was rendered by the tribunal.64 Webuild adds that for a fact to decisively affect the outcome it must be \"some development (such as a relevant and controlling judgment or award).\"65 None of the requirements are met according to Webuild, due to the following:\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 15, relying on *Landesbank*, \u00b6 35, **CL-0255**.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 15; citing *Landesbank*, \u00b6 41, **CL-0255**.\n\n65.\n\nThe Local Judgment is not a new fact that decisively affects the outcome of this case considering that (i) the parties in the proceedings are different, and Webuild \"is neither the plaintiff nor the respondent\" in the PdL Case; (ii) Webuild filed \"no evidence and pursued no rights\" in the PdL Case.66\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 17.\n\n66.\n\nThe facts between both cases differ as one was an administrative lawsuit and the other one is based under a bilateral investment treaty. The Claimant argues it has proved that (i) Webuild is an investor covered by the BIT; (ii) it made a qualified investment in Argentina; (iii) it had legitimate expectations; and (iv) Argentina breached its treaty obligations.67 Thus, it states that despite \"*some* commonality of facts\" between the claims, \"very little -other than gross incompetence and judicial impropriety- can explain how an independent court\" can reach to a conclusion that is the opposite to that of the Tribunal.68\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 18.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 19.\n\n67.\n\nThis Tribunal has already considered the Parties' different positions on the key facts the Respondent highlights in its Request for Reconsideration regarding the Emergency Law, Puentes del Litoral's failure to obtain financing, and the Concession Contract's termination.69 Therefore, the decision reached in the Local Judgment alone \"is self-serving and not dispositive\",70 and even if the Contentious Administrative Court found that Puentes del Litoral was in contractual breach, the PdL Judgment \"does not defeat or in any way alter either Webuild's legitimate expectations as to rebalancing or the ultimate conclusion of breach.\"71\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6\u00b6 20-23.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 20.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 21.\n\n68.\n\nFinally on this matter, Webuild asserts that Argentina relies on seven cases to supposedly justify revision of the Decision on Liability; however, it notes that only in one case, namely, *Standard Chartered*, did the tribunal grant a reconsideration request due to an exceptional circumstance *i.e.*, a party concealed information from the tribunal.72 The Claimant adds that the other six were decided contrary to what the Respondent suggests.\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 11.\n\n69.\n\nFurther, Webuild states that the Tribunal owes no deference to the Local Judgment as it is not controlling, binding, or determinative. Based on *Cavalum,* it argues that \"a subsequent legal authority is not enough by itself to warrant reconsideration\", and instead it must be shown that the new legal authority \"not only undermines the Tribunal's legal conclusion but shows that it was wholly wrong.\"73\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 23, citing *Cavalum*, \u00b6\u00b6 80-81, **AL RA-406**.\n\n70.\n\nFor instance, the Claimant alleges that in *Cavalum* and *Landesbank*, the tribunals held respectively that (i) \"the new CJEU judgment did not add new reasoning that the tribunal had not already considered in its pre-award decision\",74 and (ii) as the arbitration is held under the ICSID Convention and it is not seated in any State \"the reasoning in the two Swedish cases is therefore inapplicable.\"75 Webuild applies both decisions to this case and concludes that the \"Tribunal found that the termination of the contract itself under domestic law does not affect its main liability determination under the BIT that Argentina failed to provide FET.\"76\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 23.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 24, citing *Landesbank*, \u00b6 47, **CL-0255**.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 25.\n\n71.\n\nAlso, Webuild addresses the *Azinian* case cited by the Respondent and states that Argentina fails to mention that the tribunal in said case concluded that \"an international tribunal called upon to rule on a Government's compliance with an international treaty is not paralysed by the fact that the national courts have approved the relevant conduct of public officials.\"77 It adds as well that Webuild's claim differs from *Azinian's,* as in the latter the investors claimed an expropriation of their investments, which the Tribunal itself considered unnecessary to analyse.78 Moreover, the claimants in *Azinian* \"did not challenge the judicial decisions validating that conduct in the arbitration (even though these decisions had been issued before the arbitration)\".79 Thus, the Claimant contends that the PdL Judgment has no impact on the Tribunal's determination, and that this proceeding \"is not paralyzed by the fact that the national courts have approved under the relevant conduct of public officials\" as decided by the tribunal in the mentioned case.80\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 28, citing *Azinian*, \u00b6 92, **AL RA-201**.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 28.\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 9.\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 10; citing *Azinian*, \u00b6 98, **AL RA-201**.\n\n72.\n\nIn the fourth place, the Claimant addresses the possible annulment of the arbitral award raised by Argentina in case the Tribunal fails to \"assess the application of Argentine law in light of the findings of the local Judgment.\"81 Webuild states that this *threat* to the Tribunal has no grounds considering that the Tribunal \"in accordance with the BIT and international law, discerned when and how to apply the BIT, international law and Argentine law- and having done so to resolve the dispute does not equate with exceeding its power.\"82 The Claimant asserts that (i) the Tribunal \"has not failed to apply the applicable law\"; (ii) under the ICSID Convention, annulment is not an appellate procedure, and the correctness of a tribunal's reasoning, either factual or legal, is not subject to annulment; (iii) the Local Judgment is not the law in the Argentine Republic, rather it is \"merely a first instance judgment\"; and (iv) the Tribunal's tasks differ from those of an annulment committee.83\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 29.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 29.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 29.\n\n73.\n\nFinally, the Claimant relies on *Perenco v. Ecuador* to assert that \"a tribunal equally cannot, in a phased arbitration, hold the sword of Damocles above its head and second-guess itself as to whether it has manifestly exceeded its powers, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and so on\" and to the contrary, \"when deciding a claim, a tribunal should avoid taking on the role of simultaneously acting as if it were an annulment committee sitting in judgment of its own work.\"84\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6 29, citing *Perenco*, \u00b6 33, **CL-0256**.\n\n74.\n\nFor all the reasons set forth, Webuild requests the Tribunal to reject the Request for Reconsideration, with costs, and urges the Tribunal to proceed to prompt issuance of the final award.\n\n**III. THE TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS**\n--------------------------------\n\n75.\n\nThe Tribunal recognizes that the Parties disagree as to the extent of its authority to reconsider its Decision on Liability, with the Respondent arguing that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention gives inherent power to the Tribunal to review pre-award decisions, in situations analogous to those provided for in Article 51 of the ICSID Convention;85 and the Claimant contending that in accordance with the international law principle of *res judicata,* the Tribunal does not have the power to reopen and wholesale reconsider its Decision on Liability.86 The Tribunal sees no need to address this issue in detail, as even under the standards put forward by the Respondent, it considers that there is insufficient basis to justify such reconsideration.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6\u00b6 21-25; and Respondent's Reply, \u00b6\u00b6 3-7 and citations therein.\n\nClaimant's Response, \u00b6\u00b6 8-13; Claimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 2 and citations therein.\n\n76.\n\nThe Tribunal concurs with the Claimant when it observes that Webuild's claims under the BIT are independent and distinct from the contractual claims asserted by Puentes del Litoral in local courts. It further concurs that the cause of action was different, the claim in the local proceedings was brought by a different party, and the only applicable law was domestic law.87 Here, in contrast, the cause of action arose under the BIT, the claim was not brought by PdL but by the Claimant, and FET is an obligation under the BIT.\n\n*See* \u00b6 51, *supra*.\n\n77.\n\nWhile Argentina is correct that the BIT's Article 8(7) cites to domestic law as one of the sources of applicable law, it is not the sole source; rather, the BIT also requires application of the treaty (the \"**Agreement**\") itself, along with applicable principles of international law. The Tribunal's decision on FET is grounded in the Agreement and principles of international law, but also took into account the provisions of the Concession Contract, the various representations made by the Respondent to the Claimant after cancellation of the Contract, and local law, and was cognizant of the local proceeding.\n\n78.\n\nThe Tribunal understands that the Claimant was involuntarily joined to the local proceeding at the request of the Respondent. This also militates in the Tribunal's view against finding the decision as *res judicata.*\n\n79.\n\nThe previous findings or decisions of this Tribunal cited by Argentina do not compel a different result, but must be considered in their particular context.\n\n80.\n\nArgentina refers to the Tribunal's citation in its Decision on Liability to a 2008 ruling of the Argentine Commercial Court, that PdL's reorganization proceeding was not an obstacle to continued renegotiation of the Concession Contract, as a \"persuasive element\".88 But this citation goes to an issue that Argentine law clearly governs\u2014namely, the existence of a duty to renegotiate in light of the economic emergency. It has no relevance to the present issue.\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 20, citing Decision on Liability, \u00b6 258.\n\n81.\n\nNext, the Respondent invokes the Tribunal's reliance in the jurisdictional phase of this case on PdL's submission of the dispute to the local courts for the purpose of satisfying the jurisdictional requirement of Article 8 of the BIT. That was, however, a different case than the one that produced the PdL Judgment, namely, an administrative complaint initiated by PdL which was ultimately closed based on the non-response of the Argentine authorities.89 The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant that such reliance for the purpose of determining compliance with the jurisdictional requirements of Article 8 does not mean that the PdL Judgment should control the ultimate decision on liability. A requirement that a dispute be submitted to local courts for a period of time in many cases will imply a submission of the same dispute to local law. There is thus nothing in that prior determination, including the fact that it was brought by PdL, that requires that this Tribunal be bound as to the merits of an issue of state responsibility by a subsequent local judgment.\n\n*See* Claimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 8 and citations therein.\n\n82.\n\nRespondent also raises the *Hochtief* Decision, leading to a debate between the Parties about similarities or differences between the evidentiary records in the two cases.90 The Tribunal extensively considered the *Hochtief* Decision in its Decision on Liability, along with evaluating the evidence before it, and sees no basis in the Request for Reconsideration for reopening that discussion.\n\n*See* \u00b6\u00b6 28, and 43-44, *supra. See also* Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 60, and Claimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 15.\n\n83.\n\nThe Tribunal appreciates that the judgment of the Federal Court for Administrative-Contentious Matters No 8 that issued the PdL Judgment is a competent local court in the matter. It finds no basis for the Claimant's suggestion that the local court acted improperly.91 But even if the parties to that case were identical to the Parties in the present proceeding (which they are not),92 and factual overlap undoubtedly is present, the standard of decision for this Tribunal \u2013charged with determining whether an FET violation has occurred based on the BIT and international law, rather than Argentine law--is far different.\n\nThe Tribunal considers the Claimant's disparaging remarks vis-\u00e0-vis that court both unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nThe fact that Claimant was joined involuntarily at the request of Argentina to the proceedings before the Federal Court for Administrative-Contentious matters does not create such identity, in the Tribunal's view.\n\n84.\n\nThe Tribunal has reviewed the PdL Judgment carefully and considers that it contains nothing in its analysis that requires reconsideration of its prior decision. In particular, in the Decision on Liability the Tribunal considered Argentina's argument that under the terms of the Concession Contract, termination was an automatic consequence of PdL's dissolution and liquidation, and found it not dispositive for the reasons expressed in the Decision on Liability.93 It is of course open to the Argentine courts to rule differently, just as it is open to this Tribunal to do so, given the difference in governing standards. That the outcomes may differ as a result does not make them necessarily inconsistent.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6 266.\n\n85.\n\nThe Respondent notes, correctly, that the Tribunal considered that the primary legitimate expectation of the Claimant was grounded in the Concession Contract, and argues that the Claimant could not have a legitimate expectation that the State would act contrary to the law governing the Concession Contract.94 The expectation in question, fortified and confirmed by Argentine law and the State's conduct and specific representations in the wake of the Emergency Law, was that the equilibrium of the Concession Contract, fundamentally altered by measures in the Emergency Law, would be re-established within a reasonable time. The Tribunal found that the State failed to do so, and engaged in a course of conduct over a prolonged period of time, beginning in 2006, which effectively strangled PdL economically and made its failure and ultimate dissolution inevitable.95\n\nRequest for Reconsideration, \u00b6 14.\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6\u00b6256-267.\n\n86.\n\nThe Tribunal took into account in its analysis the financial difficulties of PdL prior to the emergency measures, finding that PdL's conduct justified some allocation of contributory fault in relation to the quantum of damages, to be assessed in the Tribunal's pending Award.96\n\nDecision on Liability, \u00b6368.\n\n87.\n\nThe Tribunal's previous rejection of Argentina's stay request in favor of the local proceedings, and the dismissal of the Respondent's *forum non conveniens* objection97--which was based on the same lawsuit that ultimately has given rise to the PdL Judgment--also underscores the distinctness of standards governing decisions in the local and international proceedings.\n\nDecision on Jurisdiction, \u00b6 173.\n\n88.\n\nNone of the legal authorities cited by the Respondent compels a different outcome. The Respondent places particular reliance on the *Azinian* case,98 in which a tribunal had to address the termination of a waste treatment contract by a municipal government after that decision was declared lawful by the local courts. There, of course, the decision of local courts regarding the contract in question preceded the termination, and the claimants did not challenge the decision of the courts. Not surprisingly, therefore, the tribunal held that\n\n[e]ven if the Claimants were to convince this Arbitral tribunal that the Mexican courts were wrong with respect to the invalidity of the Concession Contract, this would not per se be conclusive as to a violation of [the treaty]. More is required; the Claimants must show either a denial of justice, or a pretence of form to achieve an internationally lawful end\u2026.\"99\n\n*Azinian*, **AL RA-201**.\n\n*Azinian,* \u00b6 99, **AL RA-201** cited in Request for Reconsideration, \u00b6 15. *See* also Respondent's Reply, \u00b6 7.\n\n89.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the claim before the tribunal in *Azinian* was an expropriation claim, with the sole measure cited as the basis for that claim being the contract's annulment.100 As noted above, that is not the case here. The Tribunal agrees with the statement of the tribunal in *Azinian* that \"an international tribunal called upon to rule on a Government's compliance with an international treaty is not paralysed by the fact that the national courts have approved the relevant conduct of local officials.\"101\n\nClaimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 9, citing *Azinian,* \u00b6 97, **AL RA-201**.\n\n*Azinian,* \u00b6 98, cited in Claimant's Surrebuttal, \u00b6 10, **AL RA-201**.\n\n90.\n\nOther tribunals considering new information, and in particular new legal authorities, have established that \"a subsequent legal authority is not enough by itself to warrant reconsideration, but it must be a decisive legal authority\".102\n\n*Landesbank*, **CL-255**; and *Cavalum*, \u00b6\u00b6 80-81, **AL RA 406**.\n\n91.\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal concludes that the PdL judgment is not a decisive legal authority for purposes of its application of the Treaty, that in any event the relevant facts and circumstances have been taken into account in its Decision on Liability, and that any divergence between its Decision on Liability and the PdL Judgment is a consequence of the different standards which apply. It therefore declines to reconsider its Decision on Liability and denies the Request for Reconsideration.\n\n92.\n\nRegarding the Claimant's request for costs in relation to the Request for Reconsideration, considering the outcome of the present Decision and the principle that costs follow the event, the Tribunal considers that the legal fees incurred by the Claimant in responding to the Request for Reconsideration should be borne by the Respondent. It therefore directs the Claimant to submit to the Tribunal, within fifteen (15) days of this Decision, a supplemental submission with respect to its legal costs associated with responding to the Request. The Award to be rendered in these proceedings will include an order with respect to the costs determination reflected in this Decision.\n\n**IV. DECISION**\n----------------\n\n93.\n\nFor the reasons stated above, the Tribunal hereby decides, as follows:\n\n(1) The Request for Reconsideration is denied;\n\n(2) The Claimant's legal costs incurred in responding to the Request shall be borne by the Respondent;\n\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date hereof, the Claimant shall submit to the Tribunal a supplemental statement of the costs covered by subparagraph (2) above."}]}
