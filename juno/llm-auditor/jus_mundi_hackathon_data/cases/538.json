(\"BIVAC\" or the \"Claimant\"), a company incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Netherlands) since 1984. Its registered office is at Vissersdijk 223-241 301 1 GW Rotterdam, The Netherlands. BIVAC is an operating company within the Bureau Veritas Group, which also maintains affiliated companies in more than one country, the headquarters being situated in France.\n\n2.\n\nBIVAC is represented in this arbitration by Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Mr. Lluis Paradell and Mrs. Patricia Garc\u00eda of Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, 2-4 rue Paul C\u00e9zanne, 75375 Paris C\u00e9dex 08, France and by Messrs. Oscar Mers\u00e1n and Diego Zavala of Mers\u00e1n Abogados, Fulgencio R. Moreno No. 509 ler. Piso, Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay.\n\n3.\n\nThe Respondent is the Republic of Paraguay (\"Paraguay\" or the \"Respondent\").\n\n4.\n\nParaguay is represented by the Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica del Paraguay, Dr. Jos\u00e9 Enrique Garc\u00eda-\u00c1valos. Paraguay was originally also represented in this arbitration by Messrs. David Lindsey and Ignacio Su\u00e1rez-Anzorena of Clifford Chance US LLP, as indicated in Paraguay's letter of 17 December 2007 to ICSID. By letter of 29 April 2008, Paraguay's then Procurador General informed ICSID that he no longer had the power to represent Paraguay in this arbitration. During the first session of the Tribunal with the parties Paraguay was represented by Ambassador Luis Enrique Chase Plate, Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Paraguay, Dr. Osvaldo Caballero Bejarano, *Procurador General Adjunto* of Paraguay, Ms. Claudia Medina, Procurador\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica del Paraguay, Dr. Jorge Brizuela, Embassy of Paraguay in Washington D.C. and Ing. Gustavo Ruiz D\u00edaz, Representative of Paraguay before the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). During the session the representatives of Paraguay stated that they would shortly communicate to ICSID and the Tribunal the names of the persons that would represent Paraguay during the future conduct of the proceedings. By letter dated 11 November 2008, Dr. Garc\u00eda-\u00c1valos, the newly appointed *Procurador General*, informed the Tribunal that Paraguay had mandated Mr. Brian C. Dunning and Mrs. Irene Dubowy, of Thompson and Knight LLP, to assist him during the hearing on 11 November 2008. By letter dated 6 December 2008 this mandate was extended to cover the full period of the proceedings during the preliminary objections phase.\n\n**1.2 Procedural History and Background**\n-----------------------------------------\n\n5.\n\nOn 20 February 2007 the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") received from BIVAC a Request for Arbitration dated 16 February 2007.\n\n6.\n\nIn its request BIVAC asserted that it had made investments in Paraguay which were protected by the \"Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Paraguay on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments\", signed on 29 October 1992, which entered into force on 1 August 1994 (\"The Treaty\", or \"the BIT\"). BIVAC further asserted that Paraguay had violated various obligations under the Treaty.\n\n7.\n\nBIVAC's Request for Arbitration asserts that the Ministry of Finance of Paraguay and BIVAC entered into a contract for the provision of technical services for pre-shipment inspection of imports into Paraguay, on 6 May 1996 (\"the Contract\"). An identical contract was apparently concluded between the Ministry of Finance and SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de Surveillance S.A., a Swiss company, at around the same time. The two contracts were intended to execute a \"programme of pre-shipment inspection\" of goods to be imported into Paraguay, as established by the Ministry of Finance (Preamble to the Contract). The objective of this programme was to optimise the rate of collection of import duties and taxes. The Paraguayan Government had authorised the Ministry of Finance to enter into these contracts by Executive Decree No. 12,311, dated 31 January 1996 (\"The Decree\" *Claimant's Exhibit*, CE-5). The Decree refers to \"BIVAC INTERNATIONAL (BUREAU VERITAS GROUP)\" of France, rather than BIVAC B.V., and the Contract identifies \"Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V.\" as the contracting partner (*Claimant's Exhibit*, CE-6). By the terms of the Contract BIVAC was *inter alia* required to:\n\n(i) physically identify the goods prior to shipment,\n\n(ii) appraise the reasonableness of the price charged by the seller,\n\n(iii) estimate the customs value,\n\n(iv) issue certificates of inspection,\n\n(v) train Paraguayan personnel, and\n\n(vi) assist in the establishment of a database (Contract, Article 2).\n\nArticles 3.4 and 3.5 of the Contract allowed BIVAC to open and maintain a liaison office in Paraguay, which was constituted as \"BIVAC Paraguay S.A.\" The Ministry of Finance was obliged to pay fees for the technical services, which were to be calculated as a percentage of the \"FOB\" value of the goods. Such fees were to be invoiced on a monthly basis to the Ministry of Finance in U.S. dollars and paid within 20 days of receipt of each invoice (Contract, Article 4).\n\n8.\n\nArticle 9 of the Contract provided that disputes in relation to the Contract with regard to its implementation, termination or invalidity were to be submitted to the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n, with Paraguayan law being applicable.\n\n9.\n\nThe Contract was to run for a term of three years, and could be extended periodically (Article 8.2). The term of the Contract was due to expire in June 1999. BIVAC asserts that it carried out some 70,000 inspections over the three year period of the Contract, and that it had issued 35 invoices. It alleged that 19 of the invoices remained unpaid, amounting to a total amount of some US$ 22 million. The last payment made by the Ministry of Finance was in February 1999. BIVAC estimates that as at 31 January 2007, the total amount due under the outstanding invoices, together with accrued interest, is approximately US$ 36.1 million.\n\n10.\n\nBIVAC submits that in August 1999 the Ministry of Finance had established the list of the 19 outstanding invoices and, despite this recognition of Paraguay's indebtedness to BIVAC, a series of internal reviews, audits and controls of BIVAC's services were initiated by different government departments or bodies. BIVAC asserts that these reviews and audits led to the conclusion that the Contract was valid and that BIVAC had fully complied with it. It asserts that such conclusions are reflected in:\n\n- the audit by the *Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica* conducted from October 2000 to October 2002, which concluded that the Contract was valid and that the assertions of breach were unfounded;\n\n- formal recognitions of the debt by the Minister of Finance, as declared in February 2001 and in April 2004;\n\n- the investigation initiated by the *Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Aduanas* in February 2005, which led to the conclusion that BIVAC had fully complied with the Contract.\n\n11.\n\nBIVAC asserts that notwithstanding the positive results of these various inquiries, and despite repeated requests for payment, no payments were made. Instead, BIVAC asserts that between 2001 and 2006 contradictory declarations were made by senior government officials, including the President of Paraguay and the Minister of Finance. These sometimes recognised the validity of the Contract and the outstanding debt, and sometimes announced further inquires.\n\n12.\n\nBy letter dated 3 October 2006, BIVAC notified the President of Paraguay, H.E. Dr. Nicanor Duarte Frutos, on 13 October 2006 of the existence of an investment dispute under the Treaty. BIVAC invited Paraguay to enter into negotiations to reach an amicable settlement of the dispute within a period of three months. The three-month period for negotiations expired on 13 January 2007, apparently without any negotiations having taken place.\n\n13.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration dated 16 February 2007, BIVAC sought the establishment of an Arbitral Tribunal and requested the following relief:\n\n\"On the basis of the foregoing, without limitation and reserving BIVAC's right to supplement this request for relief in the light of further action which may be taken by Paraguay, BIVAC respectfully requests that the Tribunal:\n\n(a) DECLARE that:\n\n(i) Paraguay has breached Article 6 of the Treaty by taking measures the effect of which is to deprive BIVAC of its investment without payment of just compensation;\n\n(ii) Paraguay has breached Article 3(1) of the Treaty by failing to accord BIVAC's investment in Paraguay fair and equitable treatment and impairing it by unreasonable measures;\n\n(iii) Paraguay has breached Article 3(4) of the Treaty by failing to observe obligations it has entered into with regard to BIVAC's investment; and\n\n(b) ORDER Paraguay to compensate BIVAC for its breaches of the Treaty in an amount of at least US$36,121,052.35 (as of 31 January 2007), plus interest until date of payment;\n\n(c) AWARD such other relief as the Tribunal considers appropriate, and\n\n(d) ORDER Paraguay to pay all of the costs and expenses of this arbitration.\"\n\n14.\n\nBIVAC maintains that the dispute is covered by the Treaty, that Paraguay has breached several of its Treaty obligations, and that the jurisdictional requirements of the ICSID Convention are met.\n\n15.\n\nIn its Request for Arbitration BIVAC contends that the dispute is between Paraguay, a party to the Treaty, and BIVAC, a legal person constituted under the law in force in the Netherlands and with its legal domicile in the Netherlands. BIVAC asserts that it is a Dutch \"national\", within the meaning of Article l(b) of the Treaty, which includes:\n\n\"ii. legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party\".\n\nBIVAC further contends that it has made an investment that is protected under Article 1(a) of the Treaty, which defines \"investments\" as follows:\n\n\"the term \u2018investments' shall comprise every kind of asset and more particularly, though not exclusively:\n\ni. movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem in respect of every kind of asset;\n\nii. rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and joint-ventures;\n\niii. title to money, to other assets or to any performance having an economic value;\n\niv. rights in the field of intellectual property, technical processes, goodwill and know-how;\n\nv. rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources.\"\n\nBIVAC considers that the Contract constitutes a protected investment within the meaning of the Treaty, specifically that it is an \"asset\", a \"title to money\" and \"title to performance having an economic value\", since it provides for the payment of a service fee by the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC in exchange for BIVAC's services. BIVAC asserts that the rights under the Contract also involve \"rights granted under public law\", as the Contract confers functions to it that are ordinarily carried out by the custom services of the State.\n\n16.\n\nBIVAC asserts that the non-payment of the amounts claimed in 19 invoices by the Ministry of Finance is attributable to Paraguay, giving rise to its State responsibility under international law and the Treaty. It asserts that Paraguay has violated three distinct obligations under the Treaty.\n\n17.\n\nIt first asserts that Paraguay is responsible for the violation of Article 6 of the Treaty, which states that Dutch investments in Paraguay would not be expropriated or subjected to measures equivalent to expropriation, except for a public purpose, on a non-discriminatory basis, and against payment of just compensation. The provision reads:\n\n\"Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, nationals of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\n(b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the Contracting Party which takes such measures may have given;\n\n(c) the measures are taken against just compensation...\"\n\nAccording to BIVAC, the Ministry of Finance's continuing failure to pay amounts due to BIVAC under the Contract and pursuant to the Executive Decree No. 12,311, has substantially deprived BIVAC of the expected economic benefit of its investment. Since no corresponding prompt, adequate and effective compensation has been paid, BIVAC asserts that Paraguay's conduct constitutes indirect expropriation, within the meaning of Article 6 of the Treaty.\n\n18.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the Treaty provides:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.\"\n\nAccording to BIVAC, Paraguay's failure to pay the amounts due to it under the Contract and pursuant to the Decree are acts made in bad faith, in breach of the Contract and contrary to the investment-backed legitimate expectations and acquired rights of BIVAC. BIVAC considers that Paraguay's conduct amounts to unfair and inequitable treatment of BIVAC's investment in Paraguay, being objectively unreasonable, in the sense that it is without any justifiable basis, and that it impairs the investment by unreasonable and discriminatory measures, which also ignore BIVAC's rights.\n\n19.\n\nArticle 3(4) of the Treaty reads:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\nBIVAC contends that Paraguay entered into obligations with regard to BIVAC's investment pursuant to the Decree and the subsequent Contract, that these obligations have not been observed as a result of the failure to pay the amounts due, and that consequently Paraguay is in breach of its obligations under Article 3(4) of the Treaty.\n\n20.\n\nBIVAC submits that the jurisdictional requirements as set out in Article 25 have been met. Article 25 reads, in relevant part:\n\n\"(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre, shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\n\n(2) \u2018National of another Contracting State' means: [...] (b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or arbitration.\"\n\n21.\n\nBIVAC asserts that Article 25 imposes four requirements and that all have been satisfied:\n\n- there is a legal dispute arising from the alleged violation by Paraguay of BIVAC's legal rights under the Treaty and international law;\n\n- the dispute arises directly out of BIVAC's investment in Paraguay which, as described above, is a protected investment under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention;\n\n- the dispute is between Paraguay, an ICSID Contracting State, and BIVAC, a company incorporated in the Netherlands, another ICSID Contracting State; and\n\n- BIVAC and Paraguay have consented to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration in writing, the consent being perfected by Paraguay's offer to submit an investment dispute under the Treaty to ICSID arbitration and by BIVAC's acceptance of the offer as expressed in the Request for Arbitration.\n\nArticle 9(2) of the Treaty reads in its relevant part as follows:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit any legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of that national in the territory of the former Contracting Party to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes...\"\n\n22.\n\nOn 2 March 2007, the Centre asked BIVAC to elaborate on the manner in which it considered the Contract to qualify as an investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Centre also asked BIVAC to clarify the interplay between Article 9.1 of the Contract, which contains the contractual dispute settlement clause, and the dispute settlement provisions contained in Article 9 of the BIT.\n\n23.\n\nBy letter dated 15 March 2007 BIVAC replied to the first question by explaining that the ICSID Convention did not define the term \"investment\" in Article 25, leaving it to other legal instruments (such as the Treaty) to address the matter. According to BIVAC, the Treaty defines \"investment\" in a broad sense, comprising \"every kind of asset\", including \"title to money\" (Art. 1(a)(iii)) and \"rights granted under public law\" (Art. 1(a)(v)) as detailed in paragraph 15 above. BIVAC reiterated that the Contract qualifies as an investment in the sense of the Treaty since it establishes a claim to the payment for services by the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC, which is a title to money, and since it conferred functions upon BIVAC which were normally carried out by the custom services, thereby creating rights under public law.\n\n24.\n\nAs to the interplay between the dispute settlement provisions in the Contract and the Treaty, BIVAC contended that a contractual arbitration clause does not preclude Treaty jurisdiction over claims for breach of the Treaty, regardless of whether the claim may at the same time raise issues of interpretation or application of the underlying Contract.\n\n25.\n\nOn the basis of these explanations, and without prejudice to issues of jurisdiction or the merits, the Centre registered the Request for Arbitration on 11 April 2007, and duly notified the parties.\n\n**1.3 The constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal**\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n26.\n\nBy letter dated 12 June 2007, BIVAC informed the Centre that the parties had not come to an agreement as to the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal and requested the Centre to proceed in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. By letter dated 13 June 2007, the Centre informed the parties that more than 60 days had elapsed since the registration and that in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 2(3) the Tribunal would be constituted as fixed in Article 37(2)(b) of the Convention.\n\n27.\n\nBy letter dated 14 June 2007, BIVAC appointed Mr. L. Yves Fortier, C.C., O.Q., Q.C., LL.D, a Canadian national, as an arbitrator in this case. Mr. Fortier accepted his appointment on 20 June 2007. By letter dated 9 July 2007, Paraguay appointed Professor Philippe Sands, QC, a British and French national, as an arbitrator. Professor Sands accepted his appointment on 13 July 2007.\n\n28.\n\nBy letter dated 18 October 2007, following more than 90 days after the registration of the Request for Arbitration, BIVAC informed the Centre that the parties had been unable to reach an agreement on the appointment of the President of the Tribunal and requested, in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4(1) and (2), ICSID to proceed with the appointment. Following consultations with the parties, the Centre appointed Professor Dr. Rolf Knieper, a German national, as the presiding arbitrator. Professor Knieper accepted the appointment on 10 March 2008.\n\n29.\n\nBy letter dated 10 March 2008 the Centre informed the parties that the Tribunal had been constituted on that date and that the proceedings were deemed to have begun on the same day. The parties were further informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Senior Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**1.4 Paraguay's Response**\n---------------------------\n\n30.\n\nParaguay has consistently and from its first correspondence objected to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Arbitral Tribunal and has not submitted any arguments as to the merits of the dispute. Paraguay has insisted that neither the appointment of an arbitrator nor the agreement to the constitution of the Tribunal were to be interpreted as consent to jurisdiction.\n\n31.\n\nIn its first written submission on 8 April 2008, Paraguay put forward the following arguments:\n\n(a) Paraguay has never explicitly agreed to arbitration before ICSID, which it claimed was necessary since the mere fact of ratifying the ICSID Convention did not constitute such agreement. Paraguay referred to the Preamble, which provides:\n\n\"that no Contracting State shall by the mere fact of its ratification, acceptance or approval of this Convention and without its consent be deemed to be under any obligation to submit any particular dispute to conciliation or arbitration\".\n\n(b) Paraguay asserted that the relationship with BIVAC was based on the Contract, which is to be characterized as an administrative contract and thereby not covered by the Treaty. In its view, a purely contractual relationship without any contribution of capital by the contracting parties does not qualify as an investment as it is understood in common language as well as in Paraguayan law. According to Paraguay, therefore, the Treaty does not apply to the dispute.\n\n(c) Paraguay asserts that Article 9.1 of the Contract contains an exclusive dispute settlement mechanism, establishing jurisdiction of the courts of the city of Asunci\u00f3n, with Paraguayan law being applicable.\n\n(d) Paraguay asserts that BIVAC has not made any investment in the territory of Paraguay, as required by the Treaty. It refers to the Preamble of the Treaty which reads:\n\n\"The Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Government of the Republic of Paraguay...Desiring to strengthen the traditional ties of friendship between their countries, to extend and intensify the economic relations between them particularly with respect of investments by the nationals of the Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party...\"\n\n(e) According to Paraguay, the Constitution of Paraguay and laws providing for public order prohibit the State from derogating from the national jurisdiction in favour of international arbitration where issues relating to State property arise.\n\n(f) Paraguay asserts that the dispute is not of a legal nature in the sense of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and that since the Contract is of a public, administrative nature, it is governed by cogent law *(ius cogens)* and considerations of public policy and not by party autonomy; moreover, given that the State has unilaterally rescinded the Contract for reasons of public policy, the character of the dispute is of a purely administrative nature and not of a legal nature in the sense of the ICSID Convention.\n\n32.\n\nFor these reasons Paraguay requests: \"To admit this party to the proceeding in accordance with the enclosed exhibits. To admit this written pleading which asserts that Paraguay has not consented to ICSID arbitration and that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide on the request for arbitration filed by BIVAC BV.\"1\n\n\"Tener por presentando al recurrente en el car\u00e1cter invocado en las instrumentales que se acompa\u00f1an. Tenga por presentado este escrito que denuncia la falta de consentimiento del Estado paraguayo a someterse al CIADI y su clara y contundente Incompetencia de Jurisdicci\u00f3n para conocer en la solicitud de Arbitraje solicitado por BIVAC BV.\"\n\n33.\n\nIn a second, undated brief which was distributed to the Tribunal and BIVAC during the first session on 20 May 2008, Paraguay reiterated its position:\n\n- that no competent State organ of Paraguay had consented to submit the dispute with BIVAC B.V. to an ICSID Arbitral Tribunal;\n\n- that therefore the Tribunal has no jurisdiction;\n\n- that any decision of the Tribunal assuming jurisdiction would be manifestly in excess of its powers and void *ex tunc* ; and\n\n- that this problem should be solved before any further action.\n\n34.\n\nParaguay partly reiterated its initial request:2 \"That the Tribunal declare its lack of jurisdiction to decide this dispute as a preliminary matter, not jointly with the merits, as if not, Paraguay would be forced to incur large expenditures from the public treasury to cover its defence costs.\"\n\n\"Que el Tribunal Arbitral del Centro declare la falta de competencia para entender y decidir en esta disputa, como una cuesti\u00f3n previa, no conjuntamente con el fondo de la cuesti\u00f3n, que obligar\u00e1 al Estado paraguayo a una gran erogaci\u00f3n de su Tesoro Publico, para hacer frente a los gastos que demande su defensa.\n\n**1.5 The Tribunal's first session**\n------------------------------------\n\n35.\n\nThe first session of the Tribunal was held with the parties on 20 May 2008, at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. At that session BIVAC was represented by Mr. Nigel Blackaby and Ms. Patricia Garc\u00eda from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Mr. Andrew Hibbert from BIVAC B.V. and Mr. Oscar Mers\u00e1n from Mers\u00e1n Abogados. Paraguay was represented by Ambassador Luis Enrique Chase Plate, Advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Paraguay, Dr. Osvaldo Caballero Bejarano, *Procurador General Adjunto*, Ms. Claudia Medina, Procuradur\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica del Paraguay, Dr. Jorge Brizuela, Embassy of Paraguay in Washington D.C. and Ing. Gustavo Ruiz D\u00edaz, Representative of Paraguay before the IBRD.\n\n36.\n\nDuring the session, the parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules in force since 10 April 2006, which are applicable to the proceedings. They also agreed on a series of procedural matters pursuant to the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules. These addressed the apportionment of costs and advance payments to the Centre, fees and expenses of Tribunal members, the place of proceedings in Washington D.C., the records of the hearings, the means of communication to be channelled through the Secretariat, presence, quorum and decisions of the Tribunal as well as delegation of power to fix time limits, written and oral procedures, the examination of witnesses and experts and the publication of the award. These decisions were noted in Minutes signed by the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal and circulated by the latter to the parties.\n\n37.\n\nAs to the procedural languages, the Minutes state:\n\n\"In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 22, BIVAC selected English and the Respondent selected Spanish as the procedural language.\n\nOn the issue of translations, after listening to both parties, the Tribunal decided as follows:\n\na. All memorials and accompanying witness statements and expert reports will be translated by the submitting party into the other party's selected language;\n\nb. The translations will be filed simultaneously with the main briefs;\n\nc. The parties do not need to file translations of other accompanying documentation, but may do so if they wish to.\n\nThe accompanying documentation (with the exceptions indicated above), provided that it is in one of the procedural languages, will be filed in its original language. The Tribunal may require translations from the parties whenever it deems them necessary. The Tribunal will render its decisions in both languages. The communications from the Secretariat to the parties will be made in either language. The Secretariat will arrange simultaneous interpretation services from and into English and Spanish for future hearings.\"\n\n38.\n\nAs to the pleadings, preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and suspension of the proceedings on the merits, the Minutes record that:\n\n\"Paraguay submitted a Memorial with Preliminary Objections to the Jurisdiction of the Centre on April 8, 2008 (a copy of which was transmitted to the Tribunal on April 9, 2008). Paraguay filed a further document on the question of jurisdiction during the first session. Paraguay confirmed that its submissions of April 8 and May 20, 2008 constitute its memorial in chief on the question of jurisdiction.\n\nIn view of Paraguay' objections, after hearing from both parties, the Tribunal decided as follows (as reflected in the Tribunal's Procedural Order No 1 of June 12, 2008, amended by letter of the Secretary to the parties of June 25, 2008 (attached to these Minutes as Annexes 2 and 3, respectively)):\n\n- The Respondent's Preliminary Objections, as set out in the documents dated April 9, 2008 and May 20, 2008, shall be treated as a preliminary question;\n\n- The proceedings on the merits are suspended until such time as the Tribunal has adopted a decision on the Preliminary Objections raised by the Respondent, as provided by Article 41, paragraph 2 of the Convention;\n\n- The Respondent's documents dated April 9, 2008 and May 20, 2008 shall be treated as a written pleading (Memorial), setting out in full the Respondent's Preliminary Objections within the meaning of Article 41, paragraph 2 of the Convention;\n\n- The time limits for the submission of further pleadings in this phase of the proceedings are as follows:\n\n\u2022 The Claimant shall submit a Counter-Memorial, in English and in Spanish, no later than Thursday July 3, 2008;\n\n\u2022 The Respondent shall submit a Reply, in Spanish and in English, no later than Monday August 18, 2008;\n\n\u2022 The Claimant shall submit a Rejoinder, in English and in Spanish, no later than Thursday October 2, 2008;\n\n\u2022 A hearing on the Respondent's Preliminary Objections shall be held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C., on Tuesday November 11, 2008, to commence at 9:30 a.m.\n\nThe conduct and timetable for the hearing, and all other matters, is reserved for further decision.\"\n\n39.\n\nBIVAC's Counter-Memorial, Paraguay's Reply and BIVAC's Rejoinder were each submitted on time. By letter dated 4 September 2008 the Tribunal invited the parties to agree to an agenda for the hearing on Paraguay's preliminary objections, to be held at the seat of the Centre in Washington D.C. on 11 November 2008. This was accepted by both parties: BIVAC proposed an agenda by letter dated 1 October 2008, which was orally confirmed during a telephone conversation on 3 October 2008 between Dr. Osvaldo Caballero Bejarano, at that time *Procurador General Adjunto* of the Republic of Paraguay, and Mr. Gonzalo Flores, Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**1.6 The Hearing on Jurisdiction and Post Hearing Briefs**\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n40.\n\nThe hearing on jurisdiction was held, as scheduled, on 11 November 2008 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. At that hearing BIVAC was represented by Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Mr. Lluis Paradell and Ms. Patricia Garc\u00eda from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Mr. Diego Zavala from Mers\u00e1n Abogados and Mr. Andrew Hibbert from BIVAC BV. Paraguay was represented by Dr. Jos\u00e9 Enrique Garc\u00eda-\u00c1valos, *Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica*, Mr. Luis Emilio Camacho, Chief Legal Advisor of the President, Mr. Ra\u00fal Sapena, Lawyer of the Treasury, Dr. Jorge Brizuela, Embassy of Paraguay in Washington D.C., Ing. Gustavo Ruiz D\u00edaz, Representative of Paraguay before the IBRD, Mr. Brian C. Dunning and Ms. Irene Dubowy from Thompson & Knight LLP.\n\n41.\n\nParaguay requested that the hearing be adjourned to a later date. The request was based on the fact that Paraguay had only recently (in August 2008), experienced a significant change of political direction and government, after more than 60 years of government by one political party; that counsel had been retained only days before the hearing; and that more time was needed to master the complex issues arising in the dispute. At the same time Paraguay took care to \"recognize that there is continuity in statehood in Paraguay.\"3\n\nStatement of Mr. Dunning, Hearing on Jurisdiction, 11 November 2008, transcript, p. 36.\n\n42.\n\nParaguay also confirmed that it did not call into question the validity of previous acts of government officials. It acknowledged that it had been fully involved in the process including the fixing and evolution of the agenda of the hearing. BIVAC objected to the request for postponement. It insisted that Paraguay had had all the opportunities necessary to present its case, to hear and to be heard, that the request was little more than a further effort to delay the resolution of the dispute. According to BIVAC, it would be unreasonable to frustrate the efforts and expenses that had been deployed to organize the hearing.\n\n43.\n\nThe Tribunal considered the arguments and decided that it would be appropriate to proceed with the hearing. The request for a postponement was rejected. The Tribunal explained that the decision was motivated by the need to strike a balance between the constraints of the parties and the obligation to conduct the proceedings in reasonable speed and bring them to an end within an expedient and efficient period of time. The Tribunal reiterated that the requirements of due process had been complied with, that both parties had been fully involved in the process, including in the setting of the timetable and agenda for the hearing on jurisdiction. The Tribunal expressed its understanding as to the challenges facing the new government, but nevertheless considered that the interests of the sound administration of justice would justify a continuation of the hearing.\n\n44.\n\nThe Tribunal further decided, in order to accommodate the interests of both parties and their counsel, and with the agreement of both parties, to grant both parties the opportunity to submit posthearing memoranda of not more than 40 pages in length, with deadlines for Paraguay of 8 December 2008 and for BIVAC of 22 December 2008. The Tribunal ordered that the submissions elaborate on arguments already presented in written pleadings albeit in a too succinct form but that the parties refrain from introducing new arguments or new approaches at this stage of the proceedings.\n\n45.\n\nBoth parties accepted the Tribunal's decision.\n\n46.\n\nDue to the length of debate leading to these procedural decisions, the initial timetable for the conduct of the hearing could not be adhered to. With their agreement, both parties were offered equal time to give an oral presentation of their submissions on the issues of jurisdiction. This was done on behalf of Paraguay by Mr. Dunning and Dr. Garc\u00eda-\u00c1valos, and on behalf of BIVAC by Messrs. Blackaby, Paradell and Zavala. After having fully presented their arguments and having answered the Tribunal's questions, the parties agreed to adjourn the hearing an hour ahead of schedule.\n\n47.\n\nIn the course of the hearing, Paraguay reiterated that BIVAC had not made an investment in the territory of Paraguay and that therefore the Treaty was inapplicable, and that in any event Paraguay had not breached any of the Treaty obligations. It further asserted that \"there were some diplomatic negotiations between the French Republic and the Republic of Paraguay\" and that the question had come up \"whether the Government of the Netherlands ought to have participated or perhaps ought to participate going forward in diplomatic negotiations to try to resolve the dispute.\"4\n\nStatement of Mr. Dunning, Hearing on Jurisdiction, 11 November 2008, transcript, p. 44.\n\n48.\n\nBIVAC refuted the argumentation. It reiterated that Paraguay had consented to ICSID jurisdiction, that BIVAC had made a substantive investment in the territory of Paraguay, that it had complied with all its obligations, and that Paraguay had breached its obligations under the Treaty causing damage to BIVAC. It insisted that the claim was arbitrable under Paraguayan law and that the dispute mechanism clause in the Contract did not prevent BIVAC from bringing claims under the Treaty.\n\n49.\n\nThe parties filed their post-hearing memoranda in accordance with the agreed timetable.\n\n50.\n\nIn the meantime, Paraguay sent a letter to the Tribunal dated 5 December 2008, inviting the Tribunal to dismiss the entire claim on the ground that BIVAC lacked standing. Paraguay asserted that the real party in interest was BIVAC International S.A., a French company, and not BIVAC BV, a Dutch company. By letter dated 11 December 2008 BIVAC responded to Paraguay's claim, and requested the Tribunal to reject Paraguay's new submission as inadmissible on the grounds that it raised new arguments on objections to jurisdiction, thereby contradicting the Tribunal's decision not to allow any new arguments to be made at this preliminary stage of the proceedings.\n\n51.\n\nThe Tribunal invited Paraguay to give its views on the issue of admissibility as raised by BIVAC, which it did by letter dated 19 December 2008. By letter dated 22 December 2008 BIVAC reiterated its request that Paraguay's new arguments as to standing should be declared inadmissible.\n\n52.\n\nThe Tribunal noted that that the issue of standing only arose for the first time in these proceedings as a result of Paraguay's letter of 5 December 2008, some three weeks after the hearing on jurisdiction. During that hearing Paraguay submitted that diplomatic negotiations had taken place between France and Paraguay and that the Netherlands should have been associated to them, but it did not raise any issue as to standing. In a letter to the parties dated 24 December 2008 the Tribunal communicated its views as follows:\n\n\"The Tribunal notes that Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:\n\nAny objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\n\nIt is clear from this provision that the Tribunal may decide to deal with any issue of jurisdiction or admissibility as \"a preliminary question\" or by joinder to the merits of the dispute. In its Procedural Order No. 1 (12 June 2008) the Tribunal decided as follows: The Respondent's Preliminary Objections, as set out in the documents dated April 9, 2008 and May 20, 2008, shall be treated as a preliminary question; it is clear from this Order that the decision to treat certain Preliminary Objections of Paraguay by way of preliminary question was limited to the arguments raised by Paraguay in these two documents, and not to any other arguments. The Tribunal recalls that the suspension of proceedings on the merits was made at the request of Paraguay. The Tribunal further recalls that, with the consent of BIVAC, it granted Paraguay a limited further opportunity to elaborate on arguments previously made, whilst also allowing BIVAC a limited right of reply. Further, the Tribunal made clear to the parties during the hearing on 11 November, 2008 that it would not be consistent with principles of due process and procedural economy to introduce new arguments into the preliminary phase when both parties had already agreed to an orderly procedural schedule, and where the parties had had ample opportunities to present their arguments. The Tribunal made clear its direction to the parties that they should not raise any new arguments in the post-hearing memoranda. There were no objections to that direction. The Tribunal notes that Paraguay's letters of 5 December, 2008, and 19 December, 2008 raise an apparently new argument that was not addressed in Paraguay's documents dated April 9, 2008 and May 20, 2008. In the circumstances, the Tribunal will limit its decision during this preliminary phase to the objections raised by Paraguay in its documents dated April 9, 2008 and May 20, 2008, and as those arguments (and not any others) are elaborated in the post-hearing memorial dated 8 December, 2008. To the extent that other arguments raised in the documents dated December 5, 2008 and December 19, 2008 remain to be addressed, and without prejudice to any decision the Tribunal may take on the matters raised during this preliminary objections or the need for any further phase, these arguments will be joined to the merits of the dispute, in accordance with Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention.\"\n\n53.\n\nAgainst this background, we will not deal with the merits of this new argument, raised at a late stage by Paraguay. With a view to assisting the parties as they go forward, however, we think it may be useful to share our perception of the facts as they emerge from the evidence that is currently before us.\n\n(1) It has not been contested that the BIVAC Group operates in several countries, where it has established companies, including France and the Netherlands, and that the French company (BIVAC S.A.) is the headquarters and parent company. The Dutch affiliate of BIVAC was founded in 1984, as a B.V. On the basis of the information on the record, it fulfils the requirements of being a juridical person having the nationality of the Netherlands, within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. No evidence has been put before us to indicate that the Dutch entity was created to take advantage of a favourable Netherlands-Paraguay BIT, although this point was alluded to in the Respondent's letter of 5 December 2008. The evidence before us indicates when the Contract was concluded, Mr. Gilles Minard was the Executive Director of BIVAC B.V. (a post which apparently shared with his position as President of BIVAC International/France). It has not been contested that the Paraguayan Presidential Decree No. 12,311, which authorized the Ministry of Finance to enter into contracts with SGS and with BIVAC, refers to BIVAC International (Group Bureau Veritas) of France. It has also not been contested that the cover page of the Contract refers to BIVAC BV, that the Contract states in the opening that the Contract is concluded between the Minister of Finance and BIVAC B.V. (\"a company constituted under the laws of the Netherlands\"), and that the Contract determines that this company is \"hereinafter called \"BIVAC'\" (although it also refers in the same Article to the Presidential Decree and to \"BIVAC International (Bureau Veritas Group) of France\").\n\n(2) The parties apparently disagree on whether the Contract was signed on behalf of BIVAC International S.A. (France) or BIVAC B.V. (Netherlands). The documents are far from clear. The signatures are placed under the words \"BIVAC International\" and the postal address refers to BIVAC International, in France. On the other hand, the commercial register of Rotterdam in The Netherlands identifies one of the signatories, Mr. Gilles Minard, as executive director of BIVAC B.V. (Netherlands) and the notarial deed of 29 April 1996, established in Asunci\u00f3n and attached to the Contract, certifies a power of attorney for Mr. Henri Pla to act and sign on behalf of BIVAC B.V. (Netherlands). The authenticity of these documents has not been challenged.\n\n(3) The documentation is - to say the least - far from being entirely consistent. The documents presently before us do not allow us to determine exactly which of the two legal entities is to be identified as the party to the Contract with the Ministry of Finance. This may serve to distinguish the present situation with that which pertained in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/08 (*L.E.S.I. v Algeria*)5, on which Paraguay relies, where the identities of the signatories to the contract differed from that of the Claimant.\n\n(4) It follows that evidence beyond the documents is needed to determine with greater certainty the party in interest. This evidence appears to be available in the related circumstances concerning the parties in relation to and under the Contract. The evidence put before us shows that: (a) the initial security bond was issued on behalf of BIVAC B.V.; (b) BIVAC B.V. rendered the pre-shipment inspection technical services and invoiced the Ministry of Finance, which then made payments to a Bank account in the name of BIVAC B.V.; (c) the termination of the Contract was notified to BIVAC B.V.; and (d) in the course of these proceedings Paraguay did not invoke this standing issue until after the hearing on jurisdiction, even though it was previously aware of the economic links between BIVAC S.A. and BIVAC B.V. (in a letter dated 4 December 2007, for example, Paraguay rejected ICSID's proposal that a French national be President of the Tribunal because the \"Claimant is an entity established under the laws of the Netherlands but with very close ties to France by the fact that it is completely owned by the Bureau Veritas Group whose centre is in Paris\" (Tribunal's translation). These factors are evidenced by the documents before us. Both parties have acted under the Contract in a manner that demonstrates (implicitly at least) that they considered BIVAC B.V. to be the contracting party.\n\n(5) There appears to be no dispute between the parties that, unless otherwise agreed, the nationality of a legal entity is not determined by who controls it, but by its place of incorporation. Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention defines \"national of another Contracting State\" to mean any juridical person which has the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute. Case law and commentary are clear in their support for the proposition that States have a broad discretion to define corporate nationality, for instance for the purposes of a BIT. The BIT in this case does so by specifying in its Article 1(b)(ii) that \"nationals\" of either Contracting Party comprise \"legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party\", which indicates that no test of corporate control is required.\n\nOn the basis of the limited evidence that has been put before us so far, it appears that Paraguay's argument may prove to be difficult to sustain. The documentary material appears to show quite clearly that both parties acted on the basis that the Claimant was the contracting partner, even if two entities (the Claimant and BIVAC S.A. (France)) may have been involved in aspects of the Contract. If Paraguay decides to maintain this argument it will have to provide additional evidence to establish that BIVAC lacks standing to bring these proceedings.\n\n*Consortium Groupement L.E.S.I. - DIPENTA v People's Democratic Republic of Algeria* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/8).\n\n**(II) The Preliminary Objections on Jurisdiction and Admissibility**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**2.1 Introductory matters**\n----------------------------\n\n54.\n\nParaguay has objected to the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction in its four written pleadings and during the oral arguments. Whilst the various arguments raised by Paraguay might not easily be characterised as constant over the course of the proceedings so far, it has consistently and forcefully objected to the Tribunal's potential exercise of jurisdiction. Its final written pleading is a PostHearing Brief filed on 10 December 2008, which indicates in the introduction (p. 1) that the arguments set forth in that pleading are \"In addition to the bases set forth in the Republic of Paraguay's previous memorials\". BIVAC includes a similar rider in its Post-Hearing Memorial of 22 December 2008, which notes that \"while seeking to clarify previous submissions, this brief is in addition to and does not substitute BIVAC's previous written and oral pleadings\".6 The Tribunal understands from this that it was the intention of the parties to make their various claims in a cumulative fashion, and that a failure to address any particular issue in the post-hearing briefs should not be taken to indicate any intention to abandon any earlier argument.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial of 22 December 2008, para. 1 (hereinafter BIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial).\n\n55.\n\nHaving regard to the written and oral pleadings of both parties, the arguments of the parties, and the differences between them, coalesce around five issues. The characterisation of these arguments has not always been as clear as it might have been, and for this reason the Tribunal deems it useful to summarise them as follows:\n\n(1) Has Paraguay consented in writing to ICSID jurisdiction?\n\n(2) Has BIVAC made an \"investment\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, and if so is it \"in the territory of Paraguay\"?\n\n(3) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over the claim relating to expropriation (Article 6), and is the claim admissible?\n\n(4) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over the claim relating to fair and equitable treatment (Article 3(1)), and is the claim admissible?\n\n(5) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over the claim relating to the umbrella clause (Article 3(4)), and is the claim admissible?\n\nWe deal with each issue in turn. Before doing so, it is useful to address a number of preliminary matters.\n\n56.\n\nIt is appropriate to recall that at this stage of the proceedings we are to be guided by Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, which states:\n\n\"(1) The Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence.\n\n(2) Any objection by a party to the dispute that that dispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Centre, or for other reasons is not within the competence of the Tribunal, shall be considered by the Tribunal which shall determine whether to deal with it as a preliminary question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.\"\n\n57.\n\nNo issue has arisen between the parties as to the meaning and effect of Article 41. It is binding and applicable, and both parties accept that it is for the Tribunal to determine whether it has competence over some or all of the claims raised by BIVAC. The parties also recognise that the Tribunal is free to decide any preliminary objection at this stage of the proceedings, as a preliminary question, or join it to the merits.\n\n58.\n\nThe issues that have been presented to us are not novel. They have been raised in other ICSID or similar proceedings, and both parties have referred to other awards and decisions- or those parts of other awards and decisions that they deem helpful - in support of their arguments. For understandable reasons, two cases have attracted particular attention in the course of the pleadings: the decisions in *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* and in *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Philippines*.7 In accordance with Article 53(1) of the ICSID Convention, these decisions are binding only on the parties, so we are not bound by them (or any other ICSID award) as precedent. Nevertheless, these and other decisions and awards merit careful consideration. Having regard to the sound administration of justice, and the need to ensure the coherence and well-being of the system of justice established by the drafters of the ICSID Convention, we proceed on the basis that it is appropriate for us to explain why we have or have not followed the approach adopted by other tribunals.8 This becomes all the more important where, as in the cases here referred to, the decisions appear to have certain contradictory elements.\n\n*SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/13) (hereinafter *SGS v Pakistan*); *SGS Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance S.A. v Republic of the Philippines* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/6) (hereinafter *SGS v Philippines*).\n\nSee also *AES Corporation v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/17), Decision on Jurisdiction, 26 April 2005, (Dupuy (P), B\u00f6ckstiegel, Bello Janeiro), at paras. 30-33:\n\n\"30. An identity of the basis of jurisdiction of these tribunals, even when it meets with very similar if not even identical facts at the origin of the disputes, does not suffice to apply systematically to the present case positions or solutions already adopted in these cases. Each tribunal remains sovereign and may retain, as it is confirmed by ICSID practice, a different solution for resolving the same problem; but decisions on jurisdiction dealing with the same or very similar issues may at least indicate some lines of reasoning of real interest; this Tribunal may consider them in order to compare its own position with those already adopted by its predecessors and, if it shares the views already expressed by one or more of these tribunals on a specific point of law, it is free to adopt the same solution.\n\n31. One may even find situations in which, although seized on the basis of another BIT as combined with the pertinent provisions of the ICSID Convention, a tribunal has set a point of law which, in essence, is or will be met in other cases whatever the specificities of each dispute may be. Such precedents may also be rightly considered, at least as a matter of comparison and, if so considered by the Tribunal, of inspiration\n\n32. The same may be said for the interpretation given by a precedent decision or award to some relevant facts which are basically at the origin of two or several different disputes, keeping carefully in mind the actual specificities still featuring each case. If the present Tribunal concurs with the analysis and interpretation of these facts as they generated certain special consequences for the parties to this case as well as for those of another case, it may consider this earlier interpretation as relevant.\n\n33. From a more general point of view, one can hardly deny that the institutional dimension of the control mechanisms provided for under the ICSID Convention might well be a factor, in the longer term, for contributing to the development of a common legal opinion or jurisprudence constante, to resolve some difficult legal issues discussed in many cases, inasmuch as these issues share the same substantial features.\"\n\n59.\n\nIn exercising our powers under the ICSID Convention, we are bound to interpret the provisions of that Convention and the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT. In carrying out that task we will, in accordance with established practise, be guided by the principles of interpretation that are set forth in Articles 31 to 33 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. These provisions are now broadly recognised to reflect general international law.9 The principles set forth by these provisions point to a balanced approach to interpretation, one that, in the case of investment treaties governed by a BIT such as the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT, recognises the equally legitimate interests of the State and of the investor. As one tribunal put it, a balanced interpretation takes into account:\n\n\"both the State's sovereignty and its responsibility to create an adapted and evolutionary framework for the development of economic activities, and the necessity to protect foreign investment and its continuing flow.\"10\n\nThe same approach is reflected in the Report of the Executive Directors on the Convention11 and in the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT, the preamble to which provides:\n\n\"Desiring to strengthen the traditional ties of friendship between their countries, to extend and intensify the economic relations between them particularly with respect to investment by the nationals of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party,\n\nRecognizing that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded to such investments will stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the Contracting Parties and that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable [...]\"\n\nSee *Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in Occupied Palestinian Territory,* Advisory Opinion, I.C.J.

When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.\"\n\n61.\n\nParaguay raises a number of arguments - over the course of the pleadings taken as a whole - that go to the question of whether the requirements of Article 25 have been satisfied. It has raised issues that relate to the compatibility of the treaty obligations reflected in the BIT and in the ICSID Convention with its Constitution and domestic laws, as well as the argument that the essential basis of BIVAC's claims raise under the internal law of Paraguay. To cut through the thicket of claims, Paraguay's arguments essentially go to two issues: (1) whether it has given its \"consent in writing\" to submit to the jurisdiction of the Centre, and (2) whether the dispute arises \"directly out of an investment\". It is convenient to deal with the first issue in this section, and to return to the second issue when we consider the issue of whether BIVAC made an \"investment\".\n\n62.\n\nIn its initial written pleadings Paraguay argued that it had not consented to ICSID jurisdiction since neither its President (which was said to be the only office that could represent the State under the Constitution of Paraguay), nor any other representative with \"full powers\" to commit the State at the international level, had expressed consent on the part of Paraguay to ICSID jurisdiction in these proceedings.12 This argument was not explicitly raised again in later written pleadings, or in the oral arguments (although in its Counter-Memorial Paraguay stated that it \"totally ratifies and reaffirms (*in totum*) the Objections on Jurisdiction of April 9 and May 20, 2008\", to the effect that \"Paraguay has not consented to ICSID Jurisdiction\".13 We therefore proceed on the basis that the argument has been maintained and requires a response from the Tribunal.\n\nRespondent Note of 8 April 2008, p, 3; and Note of 20 May 2008, p 3.\n\nParaguay's Reply to BIVAC's Counter-Memorial, 18 August 2008, p. 2 (\"Paraguay Reply\").\n\n63.\n\nBIVAC responded to this argument in Section II of its Counter-Memorial, arguing that:\n\n\"The Treaty clearly and unequivocally contains Paraguay's consent and it is universally established that consent to ICSID arbitration is validly formulated in BITs. The Treaty is binding on Paraguay as a matter of international law and, although irrelevant to establish consent under the ICSID Convention, Paraguayan law.\"14\n\nBIVAC Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, para. 4 (\"BIVAC Counter-Memorial\").\n\n64.\n\nIn support of that argument, BIVAC invokes Article 9 of the BIT and relies on academic authority and \"unanimous\" case law accepting the proposition that for the purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention \"the respondent State's consent to ICSID jurisdiction is contained in the BIT invoked\" and that the \"subsequent consent of a claimant may be manifested through the filing of a request for arbitration\".15 BIVAC's written consent has been offered in the Request for Arbitration.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 11\n\n65.\n\nBeyond formally maintaining its argument, Paraguay has provided no response to these arguments, a point recognised by BIVAC.16 It is difficult to see on what basis it could do so. The general propositions for which BIVAC argues are by now so well established in practise and case-law that they are \"no longer controversial\".17 They are unanswerable. In the present case, Paraguay's written consent has been expressed in Article 9(2) of the BIT, which states in relevant part:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit any legal dispute arising between that Contracting Party and a national of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of that national in the territory of the former Contracting Party to the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes for settlement by conciliation or arbitration under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes...\"\n\nBIVAC Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, 22 September 2008, para. 29 (\"BIVAC Rejoinder\")\n\nC. McLachlan, L. Shore and M. Weiniger, *International Investment Arbitration* (2007), para. 3.27, p. 54.\n\n66.\n\nThere is nothing in the language of Article 9(2) that could be read to indicate any qualification as to Paraguay's expression of consent. Paraguay has not argued that the BIT is not legally binding, or that it was not validly entered into.\n\n67.\n\nInstead, Paraguay argues that under its domestic law there is a requirement for an additional specific expression of consent by its President or a person with full powers under international law, and that this has not been given.18\n\nRespondent's Note of 8 April 2008, p, 3; and Note of 20 May 2008, p 2.\n\n68.\n\nBIVAC has responded to this argument in Section II(B) of its Counter-Memorial. It refers to ICSID case-law and academic authority in support of the proposition that once a State has given its written consent in the BIT it \"may not withdraw its consent unilaterally\".19 Paraguay has not responded to this argument. Again, we do not easily see on what basis it could effectively do so. There is nothing in the text of Article 9 of the BIT that could be interpreted to make Paraguay's expression of consent conditional or dependent upon some further and more specific expression of consent by the President, or some other person with full powers under international law. Accordingly, there is no support for Paraguay's argument to that effect.\n\nBIVAC Counter-Memorial, para. 17.\n\n69.\n\nParaguay adds another argument. It claims that the ICSID procedure is \"effectively against the Constitutional and legal order of the Republic of Paraguay\". In support of that proposition it invokes, amongst other texts, Article 49 of the Judicial Organisation Code (Paraguayan Law No. 879/81) which, it is said, proclaims that \"controversies related to the properties of the state and municipalities cannot be submitted to arbitral procedures\".20\n\nParaguay Reply, p.11.\n\n70.\n\nIn response, BIVAC argues that there can be no question that a dispute concerning the Contract is arbitrable under Paraguayan law. Specifically, BIVAC argues that the BIT is binding on Paraguay as a matter of international law; Paraguay is not entitled to invoke its domestic law as an excuse not to abide by its Treaty obligations; the BIT is part of Paraguayan law which thereby provides for the arbitrability of this dispute; and that Paraguay's Investment Law allows arbitration of contracts between the State and investors that disputes arising out of those contracts be submitted to arbitration; and arbitration is expressly admitted in administrative contracts.21\n\nBIVAC Rejoinder, para. 29.\n\n71.\n\nOnce again, Paraguay has chosen not to respond to these arguments by BIVAC, at the oral hearing or in its Post-Hearing Memorial. It is noteworthy, in this regard, that another ICSID Tribunal in a case involving Paraguay has already ruled that consent expressed in a BIT is sufficient to found the jurisdiction of an ICSID Tribunal.22 That decision contradicts Paraguay's argument in this case. That decision in favour of ICSID jurisdiction was handed down in 2000, some nine years ago. We have been provided with no evidence to indicate that Paraguay objected to the decision or that it took any steps to change its domestic laws, or amend any of its BITs, in response to the decision.\n\nEudoro A. *Olgu\u00edn v. Republic of Paraguay*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/98/5), Decision on Jurisdiction, 8 August 2000, paras. 26-27 (Spanish original),-English translation available in 154 *ICSID Reports* 6 at 162.\n\n72.\n\nHaving expressed its written consent in Article 9 of the BIT without any condition concerning compliance with other Paraguayan constitutional or domestic legal requirements, and having taken no other actions that it relies upon to deny consent, we find it difficult to see on what basis Paraguay can sustain the various claims it has made in the early stages of these proceedings.\n\n73.\n\nFor these reasons, we reject Paraguay's arguments and conclude it has expressed its written consent to jurisdiction in Article 9 of the BIT, and that it has not imposed in that provision or elsewhere other explicit conditions that are to be satisfied to perfect that expression of consent, or taken any other actions to support an argument to the effect that written consent under Article 9 is not effective. In these circumstances it follows that Article 9 constitutes the expression of written consent required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.\n\n**2.3 Has BIVAC made an \"investment\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, and if so is it \"in the territory of Paraguay\"?**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nParaguay objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal on the grounds that BIVAC has not made an \"investment\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention or the BIT; that accordingly the dispute does not \"arise out an investment\"; and that even if an \"investment\" was made it was not made \"in the territory of Paraguay\" as required by Article 9(2) of the BIT.23\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial on Jurisdiction, 8 December 2008, paras.1-48 (hereinafter Paraguay PostHearing Memorial).\n\n75.\n\nBIVAC has responded to these arguments by invoking the decisions in the two *SGS* cases. It argues that:\n\n\"The Contract is a protected investment under the express terms of the Treaty and also under the ICSID Convention. Further, Paraguayan law is irrelevant as regards the question of the definition of protected investment under the Treaty. In any case, the Contract would qualify as an investment under the Investment Law and as an asset protected under Paraguayan law.\"24\n\nBIVAC Counter-Memorial, para. 31 and Section III generally.\n\n76.\n\nThe parties agree that the ICSID Convention does not define the term \"investment\". This is left to the BIT, as described below. The BIT also provides in Article 9(2) that access to dispute settlement under the ICSID Convention is limited to circumstances in which three conditions are met: first, there must be an \"investment\"; second, it must have been made by a \"national\", in this case, of the Netherlands; and third, it must have been made, in this case, \"in the territory\" of Paraguay. Subject to the point that Paraguay raised at a late stage in the proceedings concerning BIVAC's standing to bring these claims under the BIT, which will not be decided as a preliminary question (see above at para. 53), we address the first and third issues.\n\n*\"Investment\"*\n--------------\n\n77.\n\nParaguay argues that BIVAC has not made a protected \"investment\" under the ICSID Convention or under the BIT.\n\n78.\n\nAs regards the ICSID Convention, it is by now well established that in the absence of any attempt to define the term \"investment\" in the Convention, the parties to that instrument are left with a margin of discretion in defining the term. The Tribunal in *SGS v Pakistan* noted that:\n\n\"The ICSID Convention does not delimit the term \"investment,\" leaving to the Contracting Parties a large measure of freedom to define that term as their specific objectives and circumstances may lead them to do so.\"25\n\nSuch freedom as may exist is not unlimited. As the Tribunal recognised in *Joy Mining v Egypt* :\n\n\"The Convention itself, in resorting to the concept of investment in connection with jurisdiction, establishes a framework to this effect: jurisdiction cannot be based on something different or entirely unrelated. In other words, it means that there is a limit to the freedom with which the parties may define an investment if they wish to engage the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals.\"26\n\nThe parties cannot adopt a definition of \"investment\" that relates to activities that manifestly fall outside the scope of what the drafters of the ICSID Convention intended. The meaning of \"investment\" is subject to objective appreciation, having regard to the objectives of the ICSID Convention, which seeks to promote international cooperation for economic development and the role of private international investment (see the preamble to the ICSID Convention).\n\n*SGS v Pakistan,* Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2003, (Feliciano (P), Faur\u00e8s, Thomas), para 133.\n\n*Joy Mining Machinery Limited v Egypt* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/11), Award on Jurisdiction, 6 August 2004, (Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (P), Craig, Weeramantry), para 49\n\n.\n\n79.\n\nAgainst this background, we will first address the question of whether BIVAC has made an \"investment\" within the meaning of Article 9(2) of the BIT, and then return to definitional issues under the Convention.\n\n80.\n\nArticle 1 of the BIT defines investment as follows:\n\n\"(a) the term \"investments\" shall comprise every kind of asset and more particularly, though not exclusively:\n\ni. movable and immovable property as well as any other rights in rem in respect of every kind of asset ;\n\nii. rights derived from shares, bonds and other kinds of interests in companies and joint-ventures;\n\niii. title to money, to other assets or to any performance having an economic value;\n\niv. rights in the field of intellectual property, technical processes, goodwill and know-how;\n\nv. rights granted under public law, including rights to prospect, explore, extract and win natural resources.\"\n\n81.\n\nBIVAC asserts that it has, under the Contract, rights to fees arising from the performance of the Contract which gives it \"title to money, to other assets or to any performance having economic value\", within the meaning of Article 1(a)(iii) of the BIT, as well as \"rights granted under public law\", within the meaning of Article 1(a)(v) of the BIT.27 BIVAC has refined its arguments in the course of the pleadings, clarifying that \"the rights arising under, and from the operation of, the Contract rather than the Contract itself are assets\".28 According to BIVAC, it is necessary to consider its operations as a whole within which the Contract right at issue arises. It concludes that:\n\n\"The investment is BIVAC's right under the Contract to payment by the Ministry of the fee contractually agreed in return for BIVAC's services\".29\n\nIn support of its arguments, BIVAC makes particular reference to the earlier ICSID decisions in *SGS v Pakistan* and *SGS v Philippines*, both of which are said to support its conclusions. As to the question of assets, BIVAC refers to the non-exhaustive identification of assets referred to in Article 1(a) of the BIT.\n\nRequest for Arbitration, para. 11.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial of 22 December 2008, para 5 (hereinafter BIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial).\n\n*Ibid*, para 2(b).\n\n82.\n\nIn response, Paraguay develops its argument that the requirements of the BIT have not been met. In its Post-Hearing Memorial it argues that the Contract is not an investment within the meaning of the BIT, because it is not a concession, its rights under the Contract are purely rights to receive payment for services performed abroad, and not rights granted under public law, and the Contract is not a title to money because it is not a document evidencing a liquidated debt such as a promissory note or a judgment.\"30\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 30-31.\n\n83.\n\nBy way of preface, we note that practise under the ICSID Convention, including in the relevant case law, recognises that a wide range of \"assets\" may be characterised as an \"investment\", and that they are not limited to equity holdings. In *Fedax v Venezuela*, for example, the tribunal qualified the claimant's holding of promissory notes as an \"investment\" because they represented the counterpart of a credit;31 in *Salini v Morocco* the tribunal ruled that the claimant had made an investment because it had made \"contributions in money, in kind, and in industry;32 in *Bayindir v Pakistan* the tribunal noted that the claimant had trained engineers, provided equipment and know-how and incurred extensive bank commission charges and thus had \"made a significant contribution, both in terms of knowhow, equipment and personnel and in financial terms\";33 in *SGS v Philippines* the tribunal found an \"investment\" where the claimant's activities were not limited to the provision of inspection services and that it had established a \"substantial office, employing a significant number of people\" with a monthly payroll ranging between US$ 100,000 and US$ 200,000.34\n\n*Fedax N.V. v Republic of Venezuela* (ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3), Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, 11 July 1997, (Orrego Vicu\u00f1a (P), Heth, Owen), para. 40.\n\n*Salini Construtorri S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v Morocco* (ICSID Case No. ARB/00/4), Decision on Jurisdiction, 23 July 2001, (Briner (P), Cremades, Fadlallah), para 53.\n\n*Bayindir Insaat Turizm Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/29), Decision on Jurisdiction, 14 November 2005, (Kaufmann-Kohler (P), Berman, B\u00f6ckstiegel), para 131.\n\n*SGS v Philippines*, Decision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction, 29 January 2004, (El-Kosheri (P), Crawford, Crivellaro), paras 101 and 105.\n\n84.\n\nAgainst this background, which indicates that a broad range of assets have been treated as investments, we first address the question of whether BIVAC has rights granted under public law. BIVAC argues - and Paraguay does not disagree - that the Contract has the character of an administrative contract, rather than a pure commercial contract. The parties disagree, however, as to whether the rights that are conferred by the Contract upon BIVAC are of a kind that might normally be reserved to a public authority.\n\n85.\n\nWe note that in many respects a public (or administrative) contract may not be structurally different from a contract under civil law. This is recognised by Paraguayan law, which provides in Article 8 of Law No. 2,051 on Public Contracts that the Civil Code will be applicable if no special rules govern. However, a distinguishing feature of a public contract is that the State may unilaterally terminate the contract if the public interest requires.\n\n86.\n\nDid the Contract confer rights to BIVAC under public law? Articles 1 and 2 of the Contract required BIVAC to render technical services of inspection of merchandise, to verify the prices invoiced by the importer, to give an opinion with respect to tariff classification, and if appropriate to issue a \"Certificate of Inspection\". These acts allowed the national Custom Office to fix the level of import duties. Although the Customs Office was not bound by law to follow the Certificate of Inspection issued by BIVAC, it appears that in practice it invariably did so. Without such a Certificate, importers would be faced with considerable difficulties if they wished to import goods into Paraguay. In its Post-Hearing Memorial BIVAC summarised the process as follows:\n\n\"33. The Contract was part and parcel of Paraguay's tax policy by ensuring through pre-shipment inspections that imports complied with customs duty and tax obligations, thereby raising the financial revenue of the State. BIVAC's services thus pertained to the sphere of internal affairs of the Paraguayan State and its policies. In particular, the services related to the regulation of conduct and consequences of events within the territory of Paraguay such as imports into the territory of Paraguay, tax payments to the Paraguayan government and control of fraud at the level of local customs officials in Paraguay. They concerned the extent to which, and the manner in which, imports could be made and taxes paid in Paraguay according to the law and policies prescribed by the Government.\"\n\n87.\n\nIt appears from this summary and from the Claimant's submissions, which have not been challenged by Paraguay, that BIVAC was entrusted with functions that are commonly reserved to the public authority of the State acting through its customs authorities, so as to establish the conditions in which the State is then in a position to levy customs duties. This is clear from Resolution No 1,171, 3 July 1996, which \"regulates the operational procedure for the pre-shipment inspection of imports\". Chapter IV of the Resolution establishes the \"procedure\" for inspections and the \"obligations of the inspection company\". Article 11 describes pre-shipment inspections, as \"includ[ing] the exact description of the products, their condition (new or used), quantity, quality and/or origin and the price of the products for a correct tariff classification [...]\". BIVAC's functions are set out in Articles 12 to 20 of the Resolution, in relation to physical inspections, product description, price verification, issuance of reports of inspection, content of the certificates of inspection, responsibility, and technical cooperation with customs. It appears that these regulated functions carried out by BIVAC were the same as those which had previously been \"carried out exclusively by the customs authority\", to quote from Articles 65 to 69 of the *C\u00f3digo de Aduanas* (Customs Code), through a procedure known as \"aforo\".35\n\nArticle 65 of the Customs Code, in force at the time, provided: \"The aforo of the goods will be carried out exclusively by the customs authority. This operation consists of examining the goods, verifying their nature, establishing their weight, quality, quantity or measurement, classifying them according to the customs tariff, establishing their price and determining the applicable customs duties.\" (informal translation)\n\n88.\n\nThese were the functions for which BIVAC's services were contracted. In this way, BIVAC was directly substituted for the previous role of the Paraguayan customs authorities in inspecting imported goods. At paragraph 10 of its Post-Hearing Memorial, Paraguay in effect confirms that these were functions of a public character, when it states that:\n\n\"Pre-shipment inspection programs are a transitional measure to be used only until host states' national customs authorities are able to carry out these tasks on their own.\"\n\nIn our view this indicates that BIVAC's rights were \"granted under public law\", within the meaning of Article 1(a)(v) of the BIT.\n\n89.\n\nRelatedly, any Certificate of Inspection issued by BIVAC for Paraguay had legal consequences in that State, as it established a legal basis for authorising imports. Article 2 of Decree 12,311/96 provides that [t]he Certificate [...] shall be a necessary requisite for processing the customs clearance of all imported merchandise, without exception\". Article 4 of Resolution No 1,171/96 reiterates the significance of the Certificate, stating that:\n\n\"In order to clear the merchandise from customs duties, the importer shall submit to the Paraguayan Customs the Certificate of Inspection issued by the Inspection Companies, together with the other import documents required by the General Customs\".\n\nResolution No 100 of 30 August 1996 provided for penalties to be applied in the event that imported goods arrived in the territory of Paraguay without a Certificate of Inspection. It makes clear that without a Certificate provided by BIVAC, in accordance with the terms of the Contract, no import could take place. This Resolution also makes clear that in some circumstances BIVAC could be required to carry out inspections in the territory of Paraguay.\n\n90.\n\nParaguay has not sought to challenge these factual assertions, although it seeks to draw different inferences from them. It asserts that BIVAC's rights under the Contract are purely rights to receive payment for services performed abroad, and not rights granted under public law.36\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, paras 30 and 55.\n\n91.\n\nOn the basis of the materials set out above, and in the absence of grounds to substantiate the points made by Paraguay, we disagree with its argument. The better view is plainly that the Contract bestowed upon BIVAC \"rights granted under public law\", as provided by Article 1(a)(v) of the BIT. The production of Certificates of Inspection and BIVAC's related activities may have been described in the Contract as \"technical services\" rendered by a private enterprise, but the factual and legal reality is that they were deeply interwoven with the functioning of the State in its public capacity, including by contributing to the raising of public revenues through import duties. The Contract was backed by legislation and executive acts.\n\n92.\n\nOur conclusion is consistent with the approach taken by the Tribunal in *SGS v Pakistan*, which found that \"SGS was conferred certain powers that ordinarily would have been exercised by the Pakistani Customs service (the identification and valuation of goods for duty purposes)\".37\n\n*SGS v Pakistan*, para. 135.\n\n93.\n\nIn light of this conclusion, there is no need for us to determine whether BIVAC had \"title to money\" within the meaning of Article 1(a)(iii) of the BIT (we note that there is a difference between the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT, and the BITs that were in issue in the two *SGS* cases: in the present case the BIT refers to \"title\" to money rather than \"claims\" to money, as was the case in the Pakistan and the Philippines cases), or whether it held a \"concession\".\n\n94.\n\nHaving concluded that BIVAC made an \"investment\" within the meaning of the BIT, the question arises whether a different conclusion arises in relation to the meaning of \"investment\" in the ICSID Convention. At a formal level, the question may be put as follows: does the definition in the BIT exceed what is permissible under the Convention? Framed in that way the answer is selfevidently negative. The definition in the BIT follows the approach adopted in many other BITs concluded around the world. Paraguay would have to argue that its own BIT is inconsistent with the requirements of the ICSID Convention. Sensibly, it has chosen not to go down that path.\n\n95.\n\nWhat Paraguay does do, however, is argue that the acts undertaken by BIVAC under the Contract do not meet the criteria for the definition of \"investment\" within the meaning of the Convention. Specifically, Paraguay argues that the criteria that it identifies as pertinent - contribution to economic development, contributions, duration and risk - have not been met.38 BIVAC responds to each of these points to express its strong disagreement.39\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 8-23.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 18-28.\n\n96.\n\nIn our view, Paraguay's argument is unpersuasive. This issue was addressed in *SGS v Philippines* and *Pakistan*. In both cases the Tribunals had little hesitation in concluding that equivalent contractual arrangements gave rise to an \"investment\" within the meaning of the BITs that were respectively in issue.40 We have not been presented with any argument that would allow us to reach a different conclusion in the present case, where the nature of the services to be provided under the contracts and the relevant BIT definitions are broadly the same.\n\n*SGS v Pakistan*, para. 136; *SGS v Philippines*, para. 112.\n\n*\"In the territory of Paraguay\"*\n--------------------------------\n\n97.\n\nWe turn next to the question of whether the legal dispute concerns an investment \"in the territory of [Paraguay]\", as required by Article 9(2) of the BIT.\n\n98.\n\nParaguay asserts that if there was an \"investment\" it was not made \"in the territory of\" Paraguay because, in accordance with the provisions of the Contract, its performance was to be made abroad.41\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 32-43.\n\n99.\n\nFor its part, BIVAC responds that \"viewed as a whole, the operation performed under the Contract has a sufficient connection with the territory of Paraguay for BIVAC's investment be considered as an investment in Paraguay\".42 BIVAC invites the Tribunal to take into consideration all the aspects of the operations under the Contract, and in particular: the local presence of BIVAC in Paraguay through its subsidiary BIVAC Paraguay which was specifically set up to act as the liaison office to carry out the operations; the functions of this liaison office in receiving and processing the requests for inspections from importers in Paraguay and in verifying the draft Certificates of Inspection sent by BIVAC's Centres at the place of export; the provision of Certificates of Inspection by BIVAC in Paraguay to importers and customs authorities in Paraguay; the services relating to know-how transfer (customs' training, data bank) provided for in the Contract and carried out by BIVAC in Paraguay; the utilization of the services provided by BIVAC by the Paraguayan State; the clear replacement by BIVAC of functions otherwise to be carried out by Paraguay's customs authorities; the legal effect of BIVAC's Certificates of Inspections in Paraguay; and the public regulation of the whole operation by Paraguayan legislation.43\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 30.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 32-50.\n\n100.\n\nParaguay has not challenged BIVAC's assertion that it established a local subsidiary which was staffed by more than 70 employees and maintained three liaison offices in Paraguay, although it asserts that the Contract did not oblige it to take these actions.44 Paraguay also does not challenge BIVAC's assertion it invested more than US$ 6.2 million to establish and to run the subsidiary and that it had posted a US$ 250,000 security bond to guarantee the fulfilment of its obligations. It submits, however, that these investments were incremental, incidental and that they did not profit Paraguay.45 Paraguay seeks to refute the claim that an \"investment\" was made in its territory by referring to the text of the Contract, which refers to the fact that technical services are to be rendered abroad (Contract, Preamble, Articles 1.1, 2.1, 5.7), including Paraguay's transfer of fees abroad (Article 4.4) and which stipulates that the fees would be free of taxes (Article 4.6), which would not be possible in the case of services rendered nationally.46 It seeks to distinguish this case from the *SGS* decisions on the grounds that the facts are different: in *SGS v Philippines* the certificates of inspection were established in the Philippines and the establishment of the liaison office was a contractual obligation; in *SGS v Pakistan* the tribunal found that the contract in issue in that case was a concession, which Paraguay argues is not the case here.47\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 41.\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 17-19.\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 32-36.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 40-42.\n\n101.\n\nThese arguments are far from persuasive, and Paraguay seems to take refuge in arguments of form rather than substance. The facts appear uncontested: a local company was established in Paraguay, and maintained at a professional level (apparently without criticism); training of local personnel took place in Paraguay; knowledge was transferred in Paraguay; and a local data base was established and equipped in Paraguay. BIVAC was entitled to be remunerated in respect of the costs of these actions, which can hardly be said to be extra-contractual: as Article 2.10 of the Contract put it, \"The cost of such participation and cooperation will be assumed by BIVAC within the amount for its fees.\" In accordance with the Contract, there appears to be no dispute that BIVAC injected money and industry into the project to render the technical services and in addition to set up a structure in Paraguay and to create local know-how. These acts built capacity in Paraguay.\n\n102.\n\nBIVAC has also argued for the contractual similarities between the Contract and the contracts on which *SGS v Philippines* and *SGS v Pakistan* were based, and submits that the cases are not distinguishable. In *SGS v Pakistan* the Tribunal concluded that the contract in question:\n\n\"defined the commitments of SGS in such a way as to ensure that SGS, if it was to comply with them, had to make certain expenditures in the territory of Pakistan. While the expenditures may be relatively small (Pakistan's Reply estimates them as amounting to approximately U.S.$800,000, while SGS presents the estimate of U.S.$1.5 million), they involved the injection of funds into the territory of Pakistan for the carrying out of SGS's engagements under the PSI Agreement.\"48\n\nThe decision in *SGS v Philippines* is even more explicit:\n\n\"101 (...)Under the CISS Agreement, SGS was to provide services, within and outside the Philippines, with a view to improving and integrating the import services and associated customs revenue gathering of the Philippines. The focal point of SGS's services was the provision, in the Philippines, of a reliable inspection certificate (...) on the basis of which import clearance could be expedited and the appropriate duty charged. SGS's inspections abroad were not carried out for their own sake but in order to enable it to provide, in the Philippines, an inspection certificate on which BOC could rely to enter goods to the customs territory of the Philippines and to assess and collect the ensuing revenue. (...) Further, those operations were organized through the Manila Liaison Office, which under Article 5 of the CISS Agreement SGS was obliged to \"continue and maintain. until the date upon which this Agreement ceases to be effective or its implementation is interrupted or indefinitely suspended.\" This was a substantial office, employing a significant number of people. Requisitions for inspections were channelled through the Office which arranged the inspection, received the results, incorporated them in a CRF which it provided both to the importer and the BOC prior to customs clearance and dealt with any resulting queries. In addition, direct periodic reports had to be made to the Government, and from time to time BOC would make specific requests for reports or other services with respect to specific consignments.\n\n102. The position might have been different if SGS had provided the certificates and issued its reports abroad, e.g. to a Philippines trade mission in each country of export. But it did not perform the service in that way, nor did the CISS Agreement envisage that it would do so. A substantial and non-severable aspect of the overall service was provided in the Philippines, and SGS's entitlement to be paid was contingent on that aspect.\n\n103. These elements taken together are sufficient to qualify the service as one provided in the Philippines. Since it was a cost to SGS to provide it, this is enough to amount to an investment in the Philippines within the meaning of the BIT.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n105. The Liaison Office (which had a number of sub-branches) was funded by subventions from an SGS affiliate in Geneva which employed the staff. According to evidence presented by SGS, its monthly payroll in the Philippines ranged between US$100,000 and US$200,000, amounting to something of the order of a quarter of its total expenses. SGS accepted that this was a fraction of the cost of conducting the actual inspections abroad. Under Article 7 of the CISS Agreement, invoices were forwarded to the BOC from Switzerland and were paid by bank transfer to SGS's Swiss account.\n\n[\u2026]\n\n106. The Tribunal does not consider that these circumstances affect the conclusion that SGS made an investment in the Philippines. A Swiss company within the SGS Group funded the Liaison Office as a part of the provision of an overall service\u2014 essentially an informational service\u2014which for the reasons given had its focus in the Philippines. The fact that the bulk of the cost of providing the service was incurred outside the Philippines is not decisive. Nor is it decisive that SGS was paid in Switzerland.\"49\n\n*SGS v Pakistan*, para. 136.\n\n*SGS v Philippines*, paras. 101-106.\n\n103.\n\nWe find the arguments underlying both decisions to be highly persuasive. They concerned broadly similar factual and legal circumstances, with the exception of the explicit obligation to set up liaison offices, which do not arise in the Contract but which is not, in any event, dispositive. Activities cannot be subdivided in a way as to distinguish between claims for non-payment of services abroad and claims for services in Paraguay: in practise the services were treated as inseparable and the overall objective was to increase national State revenue and to transfer knowledge to Paraguay, so that the State could pursue the import duty assessment and certification at the end of the Contract with BIVAC. Activities that were internal and external to the territory of Paraguay formed a whole for which a single *ad valorem* fee was paid.\n\n104.\n\nFor these reasons we have little difficulty in concluding, in the light of the obligations under the Contract and on the basis of the materials that have been put before us, that BIVAC made an investment \"in the territory of\" Paraguay within the meaning of Article 9(2) of the BIT.\n\n*Conclusion*\n------------\n\n105.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal concludes that BIVAC made an \"investment\" within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, that it did so \"in the territory of Paraguay\", and that the dispute before this tribunal arises out of that \"investment\". Having concluded that there was an \"investment\", and that it was made in the territory of Paraguay, for the sake of completeness we also conclude that the dispute that has been put before the Tribunal \"arises out of\" that \"investment\". Paraguay has not argued to the contrary. The dispute concerns remuneration for the service that BIVAC provided under the Contract and, in this way, arises directly out of the investment, within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention. Such conclusion is without prejudice to the merits, or to the issue of jurisdiction and admissibility to which we turn.\n\n**2.4 Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over the claim relating to expropriation (Article 6), and is the claim admissible?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n106.\n\nParaguay asserts that BIVAC has failed to establish a *prima facie* breach of the obligation not to expropriate set forth in Article 6 of the BIT, namely the obligation not to take \"any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, nationals of the other Contracting Party of their investments\".50 Specifically, Paraguay claims that the facts alleged by BIVAC are not capable of giving rise to a claim for expropriation, on the basis that \"a simple breach of contract at the hands of a government is *not* expropriation\".51 Paraguay relies in particular on the decision in *SGS v. Philippines*, in support of the proposition that a mere refusal to pay a debt cannot amount to an expropriation where remedies exist in respect of such a refusal, and a refusal to pay is not an expropriation where there is an unresolved dispute as to the amount payable.52\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 83-91.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 84.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 85.\n\n107.\n\nThe parties agree that at this stage of the proceedings what needs to be made out is a *prima facie* breach of the obligation. As BIVAC puts it in its Counter-Memorial:\n\n\"The Tribunal must be satisfied *prima facie* that the Claimant's claims are capable of constituting the alleged breach of the Treaty, i.e. that \u2018the facts as alleged by the Claimant in this case, if established, are capable of coming within those provisions of the BIT which have been invoked'.\"53\n\nBIVAC asserts that the *prima facie* standard is met, and that the present dispute is not about a mere failure to pay. According to BIVAC, it is\n\n\"a persistent failure to pay accompanied by other factors: contradictory conduct by the authorities in recognising the debt and the obligation to pay, but using governmental powers to commission endless internal reports and establishing commissions for the review of BIVAC's compliance with the Contract, all of which were favourable to BIVAC; inexcusable failure to adhere by its own internal reports and thus effectively refusing to pay without any justification; unreasonable and arbitrary behaviour in light of the results of the internal reviews; and thus the absence of a real dispute between the parties on either BIVAC's performance of the Contract, the obligation to pay, or the amounts due.\"54\n\nBIVAC further asserts that the measures taken that it says are attributable to Paraguay constitute an indirect expropriation in the sense that they are \"measures \u2018taken by a State the effect of which is to deprive the investor of the use and benefit of his investment' even if title to the investment is unaffected, and that Paraguay has deprived BIVAC \"of the value of (even if not formally its title to) its right to payment as of July 1999 when the Contract was terminated\".55\n\nBIVAC Counter-Memorial, para. 120, citing *Impregilo S.p.A. v Islamic Republic of Pakistan* (ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3), Decision on Jurisdiction, 22 April 2005, paras 237 and 254.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 74.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 77.\n\n108.\n\nIssue is joined between the parties on the relevance of the decision in *SGS v Philippines*, which is worth considering in some detail. BIVAC does not in its Post-Hearing Memorial assert that this decision was wrongly decided: rather, it argues that it is distinguishable on the facts.56\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 75.\n\n109.\n\nThe tribunal in *SGS v Philippines* approached \"the question of its jurisdiction on the footing that in the Request for Arbitration, SGS made credible allegations of non-payment of very large sums due under the CISS Agreement and claimed that the Philippines' failure to pay these was a breach of the BIT, but that the exact amount payable has neither been definitively agreed between the parties nor determined by a competent court or tribunal.\" It found as fact that \"As presented to the Tribunal by the Claimant, the unresolved issues between the parties concern the determination of the amount still payable.\"57 It then proceeded to consider the implications of that factual determination for the question of jurisdiction over a treaty claimed framed in terms of expropriation. At paragraph 161 of its decision the Tribunal ruled:\n\n\"In the Tribunal's view, on the material presented by the Claimant no case of expropriation has been raised. Whatever debt the Philippines may owe to SGS still exists; whatever right to interest for late payment SGS had it still has. There has been no law or decree enacted by the Philippines attempting to expropriate or annul the debt, nor any action tantamount to an expropriation. The Tribunal is assured that the limitation period for proceedings to recover the debt before the Philippine courts under Article 12 has not expired. A mere refusal to pay a debt is not an expropriation of property, at least where remedies exist in respect of such a refusal. *A fortiori* a refusal to pay is not an expropriation where there is an unresolved dispute as to the amount payable.\"\n\n*SGS v Philippines*, para. 158.\n\n110.\n\nWe have been presented with no arguments asserting that the legal principle applied by the tribunal was wrong as a matter of law, and there is nothing with which we disagree in respect of the legal principle identified and applied by the tribunal. Where a debt arising under a contract continues to exist, and where the contractually agreed forum for the resolution of disputes relating to that debt remains available, it appears self-evident that a contracting party's rights in relation to that debt cannot be said to have been expropriated, whether directly or indirectly. In the present case there is no allegation that the debt under the contract does not continue to exist, or that the contractual forum provided for by the Contract is not available: BIVAC has freely chosen not to go to the courts of Asunci\u00f3n to recover the sums which it says are due to it under the Contract. Rather, BIVAC seeks to distinguish the approach of the tribunal in *SGS v Philippines* in the following way:\n\n\"Here there is not a *mere* refusal to pay a debt; nor an unresolved dispute as to the amounts or the obligation to pay. This is precisely the point. Paraguay has engaged in governmental conduct, reviewing BIVAC's performance and the obligation to pay not once, but at least five times, and concluded each time that BIVAC was in full compliance and thus Paraguay had to pay. Yet Paraguay has not paid. That failure to pay cannot be merely commercial. It is governmental conduct: the failure by the government to abide by its own internal acts. Admittedly, there is no formal decree cancelling the debt, but what is discernable from Paraguay's wrongful omission of payment, in these highly unusual circumstances, is a policy decision by the government to do everything within its power to deny BIVAC's right to payment. That effectively amounts to a repudiation of the debt.\"58\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 75.\n\n111.\n\nThe possible distinction between the two cases is that in *SGS v Philippines* there existed a dispute between the parties as to the outstanding amount of the debt, whereas in the present case BIVAC asserts that there is no such dispute. Paraguay disagrees: \"it is not true that the Paraguayan government has confessed this debt. Under Paraguayan law, internal letters or reports do not bind the Paraguayan executive branch and do not render a disputed debt an unliquidated claim. In fact, only a Paraguayan court can make a final determination as to the alleged debt.\"59 Paraguay further asserts that BIVAC's claims under the Contract are unliquidated and therefore not subject to a summary collection proceeding and that BIVAC's invoices have not been authenticated.60\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 87.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n112.\n\nAt this preliminary stage we are not in a position to make definitive findings of fact on the claims adopted by the parties, or express conclusions on the arguments of Paraguayan law that have been made. These would be issues for the merits. Our task is limited to an assessment of whether BIVAC has pleaded a factual and legal case which, if established, would be capable of giving rise to a violation of the relevant BIT provision, in this case Article 6. This is sometimes referred to as the *prima facie* standard (see above at paras. 106-107). If the pleaded case is so capable then the Tribunal has jurisdiction and the proceedings move on to the merits; if the pleaded case is not so capable then the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction. This was the approach taken by the tribunal in *United Parcel Service of America, Inc. v. Government of Canada* and, more recently and on the basis of an extensive review of the case law, by the Tribunal in *Salini v Jordan*. It is an approach with which we agree. The *Salini* tribunal noted that the approach:\n\n\"reflects the balance to be struck between two opposing preoccupations: to ensure that courts and tribunals are not flooded with claims which have no chance of success and sometimes are even of an abusive nature; but to ensure equally that, in considering issues of jurisdiction, courts and tribunals do not go into the merits of cases without sufficient prior debate. In conformity with this jurisprudence, the Tribunal will accordingly seek to determine whether the facts alleged by the Claimants in this case, if established, are capable of coming within those provisions of the BIT which have been invoked.61\n\n*Salini Costruttori S.p.A. and Italstrade S.p.A. v. Jordan,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/13), Decision on Jurisdiction, 9 November 2004, (Guillaume (P), Cremades, Sinclair), para 151.\n\n113.\n\nTaking this as the approach to be applied, the issue is whether the acts alleged by BIVAC, if established, are capable of giving rise to a claim of expropriation. The acts alleged by BIVAC concern \"governmental conduct\" in the form of a failure to abide \"by its own internal acts\", namely reviewing BIVAC's performance on five occasions and concluding on each of those occasions that BIVAC was in full compliance and that Paraguay was legally obliged to pay under the contract. We can quite see how such conduct might be said to be inappropriate or unconscionable, and we consider later whether it may give rise to an arguable claim that there has been a breach of the obligation to act fairly and equitably, but could it ever as such constitute an act of expropriation?\n\n114.\n\nWe have some difficulty in foreseeing how it could. BIVAC has not shared with the Tribunal its thinking as to why a refusal to pay on five occasions might be expropriatory in character whereas a solitary act of refusal would not be. Whether a contracting party refuses to pay once or five times, the contractual debt continues to exist, and the legal characterization of the obligation to pay cannot be said to have been altered. Nor can it be said that a refusal to pay on five (or even more) occasions can alter BIVAC's legal rights in the debt that is owed to it. The parties did not address the definition of expropriation in their written pleadings. The issue was raised directly during the oral hearings, when a member of the Tribunal put the following question to BIVAC:\n\n\"if the debt continues to exist, as it does, what is the argument in relation to expropriation? That's I suppose what I am having a little bit of difficulty about. What has actually been expropriated? Assuming all the facts you have made are established, how do you justify an expropriation claim where your rights under the Contract to be paid continue to exist?\"62\n\nOne Counsel for BIVAC provided the following response:\n\n\"In relation to conduct where the net effect, and once you look at the effect otherwise it would seem to us to create a perverse incentive to states to perform in the way that Paraguay has behaved, by simply refusing - wilful refusal to pay, wilful refusal to pay, which is one of the issues that was looked at in the Encana versus Ecuador case, this concept of a wilful refusal to pay, meaning that, no, no, sure, you're not ever going to get your money. That is precisely on that basis that we are bringing our claim obviously under the Umbrella Clause to seek that payment and also damages as a result of the other aspects. [...] To look at the net effect, it's a measure - the conduct of the State having an effect equivalent to expropriation. If I owed you money 10 years ago and you have not seen a cent until today, is that - through my conduct, does that have an effect equivalent to expropriation? [...] you just engage in an endless spin or everything through the different administrative organs, a wilful refusal to pay. Isn't the effect of that - of that conduct of the State precisely to have the effect of an expropriation?\"63\n\nAnother counsel for BIVAC followed on: \"It begs the question, what's an expropriation?\"64\n\nHearing on Jurisdiction, 11 November 2008, Transcript, p. 184-185.\n\n*Ibid*., pp. 185-6.\n\n*Ibid*., p. 187.\n\n115.\n\nBIVAC's argument is less than compelling, and we were given no more assistance in the Post-Hearing Memorial.65 The only authority cited in that pleading was - again - the decision of the Tribunal in *Encana v Ecuador*, which itself relies on an earlier award in *Waste Management v United Mexican States* (No. 2). The award in *Encana* does not support BIVAC's argument, or assist the Tribunal reaching the conclusion that BIVAC's factual assertions could, if established, give rise to an act of expropriation, either directly or indirectly. We have carefully reviewed the award, which merits reproduction in full:\n\n\"192. A NAFTA Tribunal in the Waste Management case analysed in some detail the test for expropriation of incorporeal rights by executive action. After referring to earlier decisions and doctrine, the Waste Management tribunal concluded as follows:\n\n\"The mere non-performance of a contractual obligation is not to be equated with a taking of property, nor (unless accompanied by other elements) is it tantamount to expropriation... [T]he normal response by an investor faced with a breach of contract by its governmental counter-party (the breach not taking the form of an exercise of governmental prerogative, such as a legislative decree) is to sue in the appropriate court to remedy the breach. It is only where such access is practically or legally foreclosed that the breach could amount to an outright denial of the right, and the protection of Article 1110 would be called into play.\"\n\nSubsequently it expressed the test for executive expropriation in the following terms:\n\n\"an effective repudiation of the right, unredressed by any remedies available to the Claimant, which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a substantial extent, thereby frustrating or negating the enterprise as a whole\".\n\nIn other words (and more succinctly) was there a \"final refusal to pay (combined with effective obstruction of legal remedies)\"?\n\n[\u2026]\n\nBut there is nonetheless a difference between a questionable position taken by the executive in relation to a matter governed by the local law and a definitive determination contrary to law. In terms of the BIT the executive is entitled to take a position in relation to claims put forward by individuals, even if that position may turn out to be wrong in law, provided it does so in good faith and stands ready to defend its position before the courts. Like private parties, governments do not repudiate obligations merely by contesting their existence. An executive agency does not expropriate the value represented by a statutory obligation to make a payment or refund by mere refusal to pay, provided at least that (a) the refusal is not merely wilful, (b) the courts are open to the aggrieved private party, (c) the courts' decisions are not themselves overridden or repudiated by the State.\"66\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 74-77.\n\n*EnCana Corporation v. Republic of Ecuador*, Award, 3 February 2006 (London Court of international Arbitration (Crawford (P), Grigera Naon, Thomas). See also *Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States* (Number 2), (ICSID Case No.ARB(AF)/00/3, Award, 30 April 2004, (Crawford (P), Civiletti, Magall\u00f3n), para 175: \"it is one thing to expropriate a right under a contract and another to fail to comply with the contract. Noncompliance by a government with contractual obligations is not the same thing as, or equivalent or tantamount to, an expropriation. In the present case the Claimant did not lose its contractual rights, which it was free to pursue before the contractually chosen forum. The law of breach of contract is not secreted in the interstices of Article 1110 of NAFTA. Rather it is necessary to show an effective repudiation of the right, unredressed by any remedies available to BIVAC, which has the effect of preventing its exercise entirely or to a substantial extent.\"\n\n116.\n\nThe *Encana* award supports the proposition that a \"final refusal to pay (combined with effective obstruction of legal remedies)\" could amount to an expropriation. The facts alleged by BIVAC do not meet that standard. Even assuming there to have been \"a final refusal\" to pay, which Paraguay apparently disputes, BIVAC does not allege any obstruction of the legal remedies provided for by the Contract. The fact that BIVAC has opted not to have recourse to such remedies, or believes them for some unstated reason to be unattractive or ineffective, cannot contribute to a claim of expropriation.\n\n117.\n\nOur conclusion may be put simply: in circumstances in which there is no dispute that the alleged contractual debt continues to exist, or that the forum for the resolution of contractual disputes remains fully available, the materials put forward by BIVAC do not raise the possibility of an arguable case of expropriation. To take the standard argued for by the Claimant, the Tribunal is not satisfied *prima facie* that the Claimant's claims are capable of constituting the alleged breach of the Treaty. We reach this conclusion even assuming that it could be shown that Paraguay acted in exercise of a *puissance publique* (see below at para. 125). It follows that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the claim under Article 6 of the BIT, as presented. In these circumstances, the issue of admissibility does not arise.\n\n**(4) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over the claim relating to fair and equitable treatment (Article 3(1)), and is the claim admissible?**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n118.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the BIT obliges each party to \"*ensure fair and equitable treatment of the* *investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or* *discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals\".* BIVAC asserts that the Tribunal has jurisdiction in respect of its claims under this provision, whereas Paraguay disagrees. Specifically, Paraguay asserts that BIVAC has not alleged facts that give rise to a *prima facie* claim: \"No breach of the [fair and equitable treatment] standard can be found where the only violation alleged is a lack of payment under a municipal contract\"67\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 91-97 and 92 and 96.\n\n119.\n\nBIVAC's position is that it expected that the Ministry of Finance would respect and abide by the law in fulfilling the Contract and that in failing to \"comply with its part of the bargain\" the standard of fair and equitable treatment was breached.68 BIVAC asserts that Paraguay's actions have been arbitrary, wilful and contrary to due process, in a manner that cannot but \"shock or at least surprise a sense of juridical propriety\"; and that the decision not to pay the debt under the Contract was \"not based on reason and judgment, when all the reviews it commissioned pointed in the other direction\", giving rise to a breach of the duty not to impair by unreasonable measures BIVAC's investment.69 BIVAC returns to these themes in its Post-Hearing Memorial, invoking the award in *Eureko v Poland*70 (in which it asserts that \"a breach of fair and equitable treatment in the context of contractual breach was found to have occurred because the Government \"consciously and overtly, breached the basic expectations of Eureko that are at the basis of its investment\") and claiming that Paraguay has failed to respond all of its arguments, including the claim as to unreasonableness.71\n\nBIVAC Counter-Memorial, para. 137.\n\n*Ibid*., paras.138 and 141.\n\n*Eureko B.V. v. Republic of Poland*, Partial Award and Dissenting Opinion, 19 August 2005, (Fortier (P), Schwebel, Rajski) (hereinafter *Eureko v Poland*).\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 79 and 81.\n\n120.\n\nAs with the claim to expropriation, at this preliminary stage we are not in a position to make definitive findings of fact or express conclusions on the arguments of law. Again, our task is limited to an assessment of whether BIVAC has pleaded a factual and legal case which, if established, would be capable of giving rise to a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT. If the pleaded case is so capable then the Tribunal has jurisdiction and the proceedings move on to the merits.\n\n121.\n\nThis issue was addressed by the tribunal in *SGS v Philippines*, which ruled that the claimant in that case had stated a claim to unfair and inequitable treatment under the BIT but that the existence of an unresolved dispute as to outstanding amount owing meant that the claim was not yet admissible: the existence of a forum before which the amounts could be established meant that the claim was premature and had to \"await the determination of the amount payable in accordance with the contractually-agreed process\"72 The Tribunal said:\n\n\"Turning to Article IV (fair and equitable treatment), the position is less clear-cut. Whatever the scope of the Article IV standard may turn out to be\u2014and that is a matter for the merits\u2014an unjustified refusal to pay sums admittedly payable under an award or a contract at least raises arguable issues under Article IV. As noted already (see paragraphs 36-41), the Philippines did appear to acknowledge that a large proportion of the amount claimed was payable. [. ] At the level of jurisdiction, a claim has in its view been stated by SGS under both provisions. But, there being an unresolved dispute as to the amount payable, for the Tribunal to decide on the claim in isolation from a decision by the chosen forum under the CISS Agreement is inappropriate and premature.\"73\n\n*SGS v Philippines*, para. 163.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 162.\n\n122.\n\nIn the *SGS v Philippines* case, at the jurisdictional stage the tribunal identified elements of the underlying contractual claims for which there was no evidence of acknowledgement of indebtedness on the part of the Philippines, as well as outstanding issues relating to the calculation of interest payable under the contract at issue in that case. \"On any view\", the tribunal concluded, \"a court or Tribunal having jurisdiction to determine obligations under the CISS Agreement will have a substantial task to perform\"74\n\nIbid *.,* para. 41.\n\n123.\n\nIn the present case, at this jurisdictional stage at least, the evidence before us does not point to any such differences. In its Application, BIVAC described the circumstances in which its claim of approximately US$22 million arose under 19 unpaid invoices under the Contract, at June 1999. BIVAC then alleged that in August 1999 the Ministry of Finance recognized the debt under the 19 invoices; in February 2001, the Ministry of Finance recognized the Contract and expressed a willingness to pay amounts due, following an audit by the Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica; in October 2002 the Contralor\u00eda fully accepted the claim, after a two year audit; in April 2004 the Ministry again acknowledged the debt; in June 2004 it appointed a \"Commission for the Review and Negotiation\" of the amounts owing, which eventually determined that this was a task not for it but for the Direcci\u00f3n General de Aduanas; and in March 2005 the Direcci\u00f3n concluded that BIVAC had fully complied with the Contract. According to the Request for Arbitration, it appears that at no point did any authority acting on behalf of Paraguay concluded that the Contract had not been complied with or challenge the level of the amounts owing under the 19 unpaid invoices.\n\n124.\n\nIn its pleadings Paraguay does not challenge any of these alleged facts. It asserts that the Contract did not provide economic or other benefits to Paraguay, for the purpose of challenging its characterisation as an \"investment\". At no point, however, does it challenge the amounts alleged to be outstanding, or the validity of the nineteen unpaid invoices, or BIVAC's assertions that it properly and fully carried out its obligations under the Contract. In these circumstances, and on the basis of the evidence that is before us, we can provisionally conclude that Paraguay's failure to challenge the level of indebtedness may amount to an acknowledgment of such indebtedness. Nor has Paraguay raised any difficulties concerning the assessment of interest payments, or asserted that the issues that the Courts of the City of Asunci\u00f3n, which is the chosen forum for the resolution of disputes under the Contract, would have \"a substantial task to perform\", in the sense adverted to by the tribunal in *SGS v Philippines*.\n\n125.\n\nIn these circumstances, it appears at this preliminary stage of the proceedings that there is no apparent unresolved dispute as to the amount payable. Accordingly, we conclude that it would not be premature to come to a decision on the merits of the claim under Article 3(1) of the BIT, at least in so far as the claim relates to acts attributable to Paraguay in relation to the failure to make payments owing under the Contract. In reaching this conclusion, we wish to make clear that we express no view whatsoever on the merits of the case. In particular, our finding as to jurisdiction should not be taken to reflect any view, even provisional in nature, as to whether a persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt, however unreasonable or unwarranted, could *of itself* ever amount to a violation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment in circumstances in which a contractually agreed remedy remains available. In this regard, we note that in *Impregilo SpA v Pakistan* (a case that did not involve an umbrella clause) the tribunal made the following point in relation to the interplay between treaty claims and contract claims, of considerable pertinence also for the present case:\n\n\"In order that the alleged breach of contract may constitute a violation of the BIT, it must be the result of behaviour going beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt. Only the State in the exercise of its sovereign authority (\"*puissance publique*\"), and not as a contracting party, may breach the obligations assumed under the BIT. In other words, the investment protection treaty only provides a remedy to the investor where the investor proves that the alleged damages were a consequence of the behaviour of the Host State acting in breach of the obligations it had assumed under the treaty.\"75\n\nApplying this standard, in order to succeed in a claim alleging violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT, BIVAC would have to meet a threshold for treaty claims that requires it to establish acts by or attributable to Paraguay that show an act of \"*puissance publique*\", that is to say \"activity beyond that of an ordinary contracting party\"76\n\n*Impregilo SpA v Pakistan*, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 22, 2005, at para. 260.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 266.\n\n126.\n\nWe express no view as to whether it could meet that standard. At this preliminary stage our conclusion is simply that BIVAC's claim in relation to Article 3(1) of the BIT is arguable. We therefore reject the objection to jurisdiction submitted on this point by Paraguay.\n\n127.\n\nWe see no other bar to the admissibility of the claim. Paraguay has argued that the existence of an agreed forum for the resolution of disputes under Article 9 of the Contract means that it is to that forum that the dispute should go. We disagree. It is well established that there is a significant distinction to be drawn between a treaty claim and a contract claim, even if there may be a significant interplay between the underlying factual issues. As the *ad hoc* Committee on annulment put it in the Vivendi case, \"whether there has been a breach of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions\"77 The *ad hoc* Committee explained that\n\n\"where \u2018the fundamental basis of the claim' is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard. At most, it might be relevant\u2014as municipal law will often be relevant\u2014in assessing whether there has been a breach of the treaty.\"78\n\nThe fundamental basis of the claim under Article 3(1) of the BIT, over which this Tribunal has jurisdiction, turns on the interpretation and application of that provision and alleged acts of Paraguay (as \"*puissance publique*\"), not on the interpretation and application of the Contract as such, although the Contract will necessarily be part of the overall factual and legal matrix. Moreover, the interpretation of Article 3(1) of the BIT is not a matter over which the courts of Asunci\u00f3n would be able to exercise jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Contract. The issue of fair and equitable treatment, and related matters, was not one which the parties to the Contract agreed to refer to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Asunci\u00f3n. The treaty issue is therefore not one for that forum, and there can be no question of an independent or self-standing treaty claim over which we have jurisdiction being inadmissible by reason of the choice of forum for the resolution of a disputes under the Contract. Our conclusion in respect of this aspect of the claim is without prejudice to the issues that arise in relation to the claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT, the so-called \"umbrella clause\", to which we now turn.\n\n*Compa\u00f1\u00eda de Aguas del Aconquija S.A. and Vivendi Universal v. Argentine Republic,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/97/3), Decision on Annulment, 3 July 2002 (Fortier (P), Crawford, Fern\u00e1ndez-Rozas), para. 96 (hereinafter *Vivendi v Argentina*).\n\n*Ibid*., para. 101.\n\n**(5) Does the Tribunal have jurisdiction over the claim relating to the umbrella clause (Article 3(4)), and is the claim admissible?**\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n128.\n\nArticle 3(4) of the BIT provides that \"Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of the other Contracting Party.\" In its Request for Arbitration, BIVAC summarises its claim under this provision as follows:\n\n\"Paraguay entered into obligations with regard to BIVAC's investment pursuant to the Decree and the subsequent Contract which it has not observed by failing to make the relevant payments to BIVAC. Paraguay is consequently in breach of its obligations under Article 3(4) of the Treaty.\"\n\n129.\n\nBIVAC treats Article 3(4) as a provision which incorporates the obligations of the Contract into the BIT, so that a violation of the Contract becomes, as such, a violation of this provision of the BIT.79 BIVAC elaborated on these arguments in its Counter-Memorial, invoking a raft of arbitral awards in support of the proposition that \"The case law has consistently upheld that the effect of umbrella clauses is to elevate a breach of contract into a breach of treaty\"80 We return to this case law in due course. BIVAC asserts that by breaching its obligations to pay under the Contract \"governed by Paraguayan law, and the obligation under Paraguayan law to observe the Contract, Paraguay has also committed a breach directly cognizable as a Treaty breach pursuant to the umbrella clause\", and that accordingly the Tribunal may exercise jurisdiction over this treaty claim.81 In making this argument, BIVAC appears to recognize that in determining the claim under Article 3(4) the Tribunal \"must take into account the Contract and whether the Ministry breached it, as well as Paraguayan law as applicable to the Contract\"82 In other words, it is not possible to form a view on whether the Treaty obligation have been met without reaching a conclusion as to whether there has been a breach of the Contract. BIVAC further argues that this claim is admissible: it seeks to distinguish the facts from the decision on jurisdiction in *SGS v Philippines*, where the Tribunal found that it had jurisdiction over the claims under the umbrella clause but decided to stay the proceedings on the grounds that this claim and that in relation to the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment were premature and that \"justice would be best served if the Tribunal were to stay the present proceedings pending determination of the amount payable... in accordance with [the contract]\"83 We return to this point below. BIVAC restates and elaborates upon these arguments in its Rejoinder and in its Post-Hearing Memorial. Perhaps anticipating issues that might arise, it sought to address the possibility that whatever the finding may be as to jurisdiction in relation to Article 3(4), the claim should also be admissible, on the grounds that if the drafters had intended to exclude treaty jurisdiction under an umbrella clause they could have inserted a clause to that effect in the BIT, as the Netherlands and India did in their BIT84 Further, BIVAC asserts:\n\n\"Had Paraguay or the Netherlands been concerned about the overlap with contract dispute resolutions clauses, and the choice thus being given to an investor to resort to arbitration under the Treaty, they would have not opted for such a wide jurisdiction clause, or could have used one of the limitations for contract claims that exist in BIT practice as described above. The Netherlands, for example, included such limitation in its BITs with India and Oman. In short, any limitations would have been stated expressly.\"85\n\nIn its Post-hearing Memorial BIVAC develops its arguments as to jurisdiction under Article 3(4), and reiterates its reliance on case-law. It also asserts that BIVAC's claims are fully admissible and that \"Paraguay does not seem to challenge this\"86\n\nSee also BIVAC Rejoinder, para. 19.\n\nBIVAC Counter-Memorial, para. 143.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 147.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 153.\n\nCited in BIVAC Counter-Memorial, para. 155.\n\nBIVAC Rejoinder, para. 14, referring to Article 4(5) of the Netherlands - India BIT (which is quoted as providing: \"Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party. Provided that dispute resolution under Article 9 of this Agreement shall only be applicable in the absence of a normal, local, judicial remedy being available.\")\n\n*Ibid*., para. 16.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 99.\n\n130.\n\nIn response, Paraguay's argument has evolved over time. In its written submissions of April and May 2008 it argues that the dispute is governed by the Contract and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction clause. In its Reply to BIVAC's Counter-Memorial, Paraguay invoked Clause 9(1) of the Contract, which provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Asunci\u00f3n for the resolution of all disputes under the Contract are to be resolved for the exclusive jurisdiction, and asserts:\n\n\"The BIVAC BV claim against the Ministry of Finance of Paraguay for payment on its services provided abroad specified in the Administrative *Contract* is a matter of Administrative Law. In fact, it is a matter of PUBLIC LAW and it would be wrong to settle the issue under the principles and rules of PRIVATE LAW. The dispute is unrelated to the Bilateral Agreement (The Treaty) and it must be decided within the Jurisdiction of Paraguayan Tribunals.\"87\n\nParaguay asserts that Article 9(1) of the Contract establishes \"an exclusive jurisdiction to resolve controversies\", that the parties to the Contract \"excluded the jurisdiction of International Arbitral Tribunals\", and that \"it was the free will of the parties which have decided to rule their rights under laws within Paraguayan Territory and Paraguayan Tribunals\". In support of that argument Paraguay relied on the Decision on Jurisdiction of the ICSID tribunal in the *Aguas del Tunari v Republic of Bolivia*88(we note that the Tribunal in that case ruled that \"the Concession does not place all disputes concerning the Concession within the exclusive jurisdiction of Bolivian courts\" and that the decision does not indicate whether Aguas del Tunari was asserting jurisdiction on the basis of an \"umbrella clause).\n\nParaguay Reply, p. 6.\n\n*Aguas del Tunari S.A. v. Republic of Bolivia* (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/3), Decision on Respondent's Objections to Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005.\n\n131.\n\nIn its Post Hearing Memorial Paraguay clarifies its position and responds to the various authorities invoked by BIVAC. It asserts that when the parties signed the Contract they \"expressly agreed to resolve disputes of this type in the sovereign courts of Paraguay under Paraguayan law. The parties should be held to their agreement, and this case should be dismissed.\"89 It argues that the types of action that the umbrella clause in the BIT is intended to protect investors from \"is not of the type which can be undertaken by an ordinary private party, but rather is the type which involves the exercise of a state's sovereign powers\".90 It asserts that \"because the core claims in question are exclusively related to a domestic commercial contract, the Tribunal should enforce the Contract's exclusive forum selection clause and dismiss BIVAC's claims\".91 It argues that a \"mere failure to pay does not convert a domestic dispute into an international one\", and relies on the two *SGS* decisions to support its proposition that \"neither of these tribunals interpreted the umbrella clause to elevate a pure breach of a commercial contract into a treaty violation\", and relies in particular on the decision in *SGS v. Pakistan* as authority that \"the Tribunal held that it had no jurisdiction to decide SGS's purely contractual claims\".92\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, Introduction, p. 2.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 61.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 58.\n\nIbid., para. 63.\n\n132.\n\nThe issues that divide the parties on Article 3(4) of the BIT relate to two issues: the issue of jurisdiction, namely whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction over BIVAC's claims under Article 3(4); and the issue of admissibility, namely whether in the event that the Tribunal does have jurisdiction, the claim is admissible. It is true that Paraguay has not framed its argument in terms of admissibility, a point that is alluded to by BIVAC.93 However, the substance of Paraguay's argument is substantively to that effect: it's consistent position has been that contract claims are for the courts of Asunci\u00f3n under Article 9 of the Contract, and in its Post-Hearing Memorial it affirms its strong support for the primacy of the exclusive jurisdiction clause, arguing that \"if these are really just contract claims, as we submit, then that clause requires BIVAC to sue in Paraguay\".94\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 99.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 53.\n\n133.\n\nAgainst this background, we deal first with the issue of jurisdiction and then the issue of admissibility.\n\n*Article 3(4): Jurisdiction*\n----------------------------\n\n134.\n\nBIVAC asserts that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under Article 3(4) of the BIT over claims relating to \"any conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to [the] Contract\". BIVAC presents this on the basis that it is making a Treaty claim rather than a contractual claim.95\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, para. 64.\n\n135.\n\nIn making this argument in its Counter-Memorial, BIVAC relies on *Vivendi I*, to the effect that if the Tribunal has jurisdiction under the umbrella clause to hear the claim then it cannot be dismissed because it could or should have been dealt with by a national court.96 In its Rejoinder BIVAC argues that Article 3(4) gave the Tribunal jurisdiction as it placed an obligation of respect on the parties for the contractual obligations, which Paraguay had breached.97\n\nBIVAC Counter-Memorial, para. 150.\n\nBIVAC Rejoinder, para 19.\n\n136.\n\nIn making its argument, BIVAC provides a summary of the history of the use of umbrella clauses in seeking to show that Article 3(4) could be applied to all types of contracts in respect of any sort of breach by the State as a contracting party, in line with the \"object and purpose of the treaty to promote and protect investment\"98 BIVAC has sought to distinguish the conclusion of the Tribunal in *SGS v Pakistan* as \"probably linked to the very narrow language used in that treaty.\"99 BIVAC relies heavily on the holding of the *SGS v Philippines* tribunal which, it submitted, \"is fully applicable here.\"100\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 84-93.\n\n*Ibid*., para 89.\n\n*Ibid*., para 96.\n\n137.\n\nParaguay has strongly objected to BIVAC's argument. In its Reply it refers to the exclusionary nature of the jurisdiction given to the Paraguayan courts by the parties to the Contract of their own free will, in Article 9 of the Contract.101 In its Post-Hearing Memorial, Paraguay refines its argument, submitting that an umbrella clause could not elevate a contractual claim into a treaty violation on the grounds that \"a mere failure to pay does not convert a domestic dispute into an international one.\"102 Paraguay argues that BIVAC is not raising genuine Treaty claims but making a contractual claim:\n\n\"Despite BIVAC's clever framing of its \"treaty claims,\" BIVAC's factual allegations are exclusively premised on lack of payment under the Contract.\"103\n\nParaguay further contends that neither *SGS v Philippines* nor *SGS v Pakistan* interpreted the umbrella clause in such a way that ultimately gave the Tribunal the basis for jurisdiction.104\n\nParaguay Reply, p.9.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, para 63.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 51\n\n*Ibid*., para 63.\n\n138.\n\nThe parties have addressed extensive arguments to the decisions in *SGS v Pakistan* and *SGS v Philippines*, and in particular the question of whether an umbrella clause can establish a tribunal's jurisdiction in relation to commitments made under a contract. It is appropriate that we address those decisions, which turned on the particular facts - including the relevant contractual and BIT provisions - and arguments advanced in the respective cases. Nevertheless, the two decisions cannot be reconciled, reflecting different approaches to this issue to the effect of an umbrella clause in the framework of a BIT.\n\n139.\n\nIn *SGS v Pakistan,* the tribunal found that an umbrella clause did not automatically elevate a breach of contract claim to the level of a claim for a breach of international law and it would only be under \"exceptional circumstances\" that it would provide a basis for accepting jurisdiction over a contract claim.105 The Tribunal gave four reasons for adopting a restrictive interpretation to the umbrella clause: first, that it was too wide and read like a legal obligation of a general character; second, that general principles of international law generated a presumption against the broad interpretation of the clause; third, because of a concern that such a reading of an umbrella clause would override dispute settlement clauses negotiated in contracts; and fourth, that the umbrella clause would have appeared earlier in the BIT if it were to impose substantive international obligations.\n\nSGS v Pakistan, para 96(b)\n\n140.\n\nIn *SGS v Philippines* the tribunal rejected the approach taken in the earlier decision. It ruled that the umbrella clause gave the tribunal jurisdiction on the basis of a broad interpretation of the mandatory language contained in the text of the provision of the BIT that was at issue in that case. On the issue of jurisdiction, the tribunal disagreed with the reasoning of the tribunal in *SGS v Pakistan*, although it's finding was without prejudice to what it would rule in relation to the admissibility of the claim, a point to which we return below.106 In support of its conclusion that the contract claim could be brought within the scope of the umbrella clause, the tribunal advanced the following arguments: first, that the text of the provision was phrased in mandatory language, which imposed obligations on the parties;107second, that the overriding purpose of the BIT should be given effect by resolving any uncertainty regarding the scope of the provision in favour of protecting investment;108 and third, that the parties were free to stipulate a restriction in the BIT to limit the umbrella clause to obligations arising under \"other international law instruments\" and they had not done so.109\n\n*SGS v Philippines,* para 138.\n\n*SGS v Philippines,* para. 115.\n\n*SGS v Philippines,* para. 116.\n\n*SGS v Philippines,* para. 118.\n\n141.\n\nWe have carefully considered the meaning and effect of Article 3(4) of the BIT. We recognise in particular that there is no *jurisprudence constante* on the effect of umbrella clauses, that the subject is one on which legal opinion is divided, that the relationship between commercial and sovereign acts of government is not free from difficulty, and that each particular clause falls to be interpreted and applied according to its precise wording and the context in which it is included in a BIT. We have carefully weighed and debated the competing arguments of the parties, following which the conclusion that has prevailed is that Article 3(4) of the BIT establishes an international obligation for the parties to the BIT to observe contractual obligation with respect to investors. In reaching this conclusion the broadly worded text of Article 3(4) of the BIT has been significant. It provides that Paraguay \"shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of the other Contracting Party *.\"* The words \"any obligation\" are all encompassing. They are not limited to international obligations, or non-contractual obligations, so that they appear without apparent limitation with respect to commitments that impose legal obligations. On a plain meaning they are undoubtedly capable of being read to include a contractual arrangement entered into by BIVAC and the Ministry of Finance of Paraguay, whereby the alleged breaches of the Ministry are attributable to the State. The umbrella clause also appears early on in the BIT, in the same provision as that imposing an obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, and it is located before the obligation on expropriation: this might distinguish this BIT from that in issue in *SGS v Pakistan* (even assuming the tribunal's point on the location within a treaty of any particular text to have force). Moreover, we consider that the umbrella clause has to be interpreted in such a way as to give it some meaning and practical effect: Paraguay has not explained the purpose or effect of the umbrella clause if it was not that for which BIVAC argues.110\n\nBIVAC's argument based on the text of Article 4(5) of the Netherlands - India BIT - see above at footnote 84 -tends to support our conclusion, but it does not address the situation in the present case where the parties to the Contract have agreed on an exclusive jurisdiction clause. Rather, Article 4(5) of that BIT appears to provide for jurisdiction or admissibility in respect of a claim under that umbrella clause to be dependent on the \"absence of a normal, local, judicial remedy being available\".\n\n142.\n\nFor these reasons, we conclude that Article 3(4) of the BIT does have the effect for which BIVAC argues, namely that it gives the Tribunal jurisdiction over a claim that arises from or is produced directly in relation to the Contract. This is not, however, the end of the matter. Assuming that Article 3(4) does import the obligations under the Contract into the BIT, giving this Tribunal jurisdiction to interpret and apply the Contract as such, then it must have imported into the BIT all of the obligations owed by Paraguay to BIVAC under the Contract. This would include not only the obligation to make payment of invoices in accordance with the requirements of the Contract, but also the obligation (implicit if nothing else) to ensure that the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n were available to resolve any \"conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to\" the Contract. This raises an issue of admissibility, to which we now turn. The effect of an umbrella clause is one issue; a different issue is whether such a clause may be invoked in circumstances where the parties have clearly agreed on an exclusive jurisdiction for the resolution of contractual disputes that may fall within the terms of the umbrella clause.\n\n*Article 3(4): Admissibility*\n-----------------------------\n\n143.\n\nIn the present case the issue of admissibility in relation to the possible exercise of jurisdiction under Article 3(4) of the BIT may be put simply: assuming that Article 3(4) allows the Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction over a contractual dispute - in which the essential cause of action is the Contract - does the existence of Article 9 of the Contract and the agreement of the parties to have recourse to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Asunci\u00f3n act as a bar to the Tribunal's exercise of jurisdiction under Article 3(4) of the BIT? The answer to that question turns on the meaning and effect of Article 9 of the Contract; the subject matter jurisdiction that the Tribunal might have to exercise under Article 3(4) of the BIT; and the legal principles that govern the relationship between these two provisions in the event of a conflict between them. We deal with each point in turn.\n\n144.\n\nArticle 9(1) of the Contract provides as follows:\n\n\"Any conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to this Contract, non compliance, resolution or invalidity shall be submitted to the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n pursuant to Paraguayan Law.\"\n\n145.\n\nThere appears to be no disagreement between the parties as to the meaning and effect of this provision in relation to a dispute under the Contract, and their mutual desire to respect the autonomy and exercise of will by the parties to the Contract: Article 9(1) is an exclusive jurisdiction clause which post-dated the BIT and has been voluntarily accepted by the parties to the Contract and which has the effect of precluding any body other than the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n from resolving any dispute \"which arises from or is produced in relation to\" the Contract, which Tribunals are bound to apply the law of Paraguay. On its face, the text is very broad: the words \"any conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to\" the Contract are capable of being interpreted to include not only disputes relating directly to alleged breaches of the Contract but also disputes concerning acts that may be connected with the Contract which may give rise to claims under other instruments, including the BIT. The parties did not direct their attentions to this point. Be that as it may, the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n have not been given competence to interpret and apply the BIT. BIVAC appears to recognise that the effect of this provision is to preclude this Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction over the contractual dispute between the parties, as such. Instead, BIVAC says, acting under Article 3(4) of the BIT the Tribunal would exercise jurisdiction over a distinct and free standing treaty obligation into which the contractual obligations would, in effect, have been incorporated. In exercise of our jurisdiction we would be interpreting and applying the Treaty, not the Contract, BIVAC argues, and it \"is not requiring this Tribunal to exercise contractual jurisdiction\".111\n\nBIVAC Counter-Memorial, para. 151.\n\n146.\n\nIn considering the effect of Article 9 it is appropriate to consider its relationship in time to the BIT. The BIT came first. It was concluded in The Hague on 29 October 1992, and came into effect shortly afterwards, on 1 August 1994. The Contract between BIVAC and the Ministry of Finance was executed on 6 May 1996, that is nearly two years after the BIT came into force. No evidence has been tendered by the parties as to the relevance of the BIT to BIVAC's decision to enter into the Contract. Paraguay, and its Ministry of Finance, must be taken to have knowledge of the treaties that it has entered into, and it would be surprising if those responsible for advising BIVAC on the legal aspects of the Contract were not aware of the BIT and the protections it provided, including the potential availability of ICSID arbitration for certain treaty disputes. Knowledge of the BIT was not, however, a subject to which arguments or evidence have been addressed by the parties. Nevertheless, the parties agreed to include in the Contract a provision which provides for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n to settle \"Any conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to this Contract, non compliance, resolution or invalidity\". The parties could have included a provision in Article 9(1) to the effect that the obligations it imposed were without prejudice to any rights under the BIT, including the possible exercise of jurisdiction by an ICSID Tribunal to any matters arising under the Contract which could fall to be determined under Article 3(4) of the BIT. The fact that they did not do so is not without relevance: it indicates, at the very least, that the parties to the Contract, including BIVAC, intended the exclusive contractual jurisdiction of the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n to be absolute and without exception, and for it to mean what it says.\n\n147.\n\nAs set out above, Article 3(4) of the BIT is broadly worded and has the effect of importing the obligations under the Contract into the BIT. Such obligations include the contractual arrangement entered into by BIVAC and the Ministry of Finance of Paraguay, comprising amongst other obligations the obligation to make payment of invoices in accordance with the requirements of the Contract, and the implicit obligation to ensure that the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n were available to resolve any \"conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to\" the Contract. On such a reading, and assuming that BIVAC's approach to these issues is correct, if Paraguay had taken steps to prevent the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n from exercising jurisdiction over a dispute in relation to the Contract, then BIVAC would be entitled to challenge such an act under Article 3(4).\n\n148.\n\nThe broader point, however, having regard to the fundamental principle that the autonomy and will of the parties is to be respected, is that the parties to a contract are not free to pick and choose those parts of the Contract that they may wish to incorporate into an \"umbrella clause\" provision such as Article 3(4) and to ignore others. The obligation that Paraguay entered into with BIVAC was to pay its invoices in a timely way and if it failed to do so to allow any contractual dispute to go to the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n. To allow BIVAC to choose those obligations it wished to incorporate into the BIT and to ignore others would seriously and negatively undermine contractual autonomy. If the parties to a contract have freely entered into commitments, they must respect those commitments, and they are entitled to expect that others, including international courts and tribunals, also respect them, unless there are powerful reasons for not doing so.112 BIVAC has not identified any reasons at all.\n\nSee in this sense the recent Concurring Opinion of Professor Abi Saab in *TSA Spectrum de Argentina S.A. v Argentine Republic* (ICSID Case No. ARB/05/5), 19 December 2008, at para. 5:  \n \"Thus, where what is contended in the treaty claim is mainly that the contract has been violated and that this violation constitutes in turn and by another name (figuring in the treaty) a treaty violation, such a nominal trick does not suffice to transform the contract claim into a treaty claim or to create a parallel treaty claim. To use the terminology of *Vivendi II*, \"where \u2018the fundamental basis of the claim'\" is the contract, however, many more layers of claims one tops it with, it remains a contract claim, which has to be settled according to the terms of the contract and in the forum chosen in that contract.\"\n\n149.\n\nInstead, it seeks to address this issue by arguing, in effect, that if this Tribunal were to exercise jurisdiction under Article 3(4) in the way that it wished then it would only be interpreting and applying the Treaty not the Contract. This strikes us as being entirely artificial. There is no freestanding international treaty obligation, under the BIT or anywhere else, which would allow this Tribunal to determine whether the acts of Paraguay gave rise to a violation of Article 3(4) of the BIT. The reality is that the Tribunal would have to interpret and apply the Contract, to determine whether Paraguay was or was not in breach of its obligations thereunder to make certain payments on the nineteen invoices. If the Tribunal was to find that there was a breach of the Contract, on BIVAC's argument it would have to find also a breach of the BIT. But if the Tribunal were to find no breach of the Contract, there would be no breach of the BIT. Everything turns on the meaning and effect of the Contract. BIVAC has provided no explanation as to where in the BIT, or anywhere else in the rules of international law, the Tribunal might find the \"independent standard\" that might allow it to determine whether or not Article 3(4) has been breached. The *ad hoc* Committee in *Vivendi* adverted to these considerations in invoking the decision in the *Woodruff* case, to conclude that\n\n\"where \"the fundamental basis of the claim\" is a treaty laying down an independent standard by which the conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract between the claimant and the respondent state or one of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the application of the treaty standard\".113\n\nIn the present case, in relation to Article 3(4) we do not see how it could be concluded that \"the fundamental basis of the claim\" was the BIT rather than the Contract. Any other approach strikes us as being so artificial as to be unreasonable.\n\n*Supra*., note 77.\n\n150.\n\nWe are not the first tribunal to face this issue. Both parties have invoked a number of arbitral decisions and awards in favour of the positions for which they argue. Although we are not bound by these earlier decisions and awards, it is both useful and appropriate to have regard to them to explain our approach. It is clear that with the passage of time the issues have crystallised as there has been greater time for reflection. We recognise that tribunals which first had to deal with these issues were often doing so without the benefit of commentary and reaction, on the basis of the facts of their particular cases and the arguments that were presented by the parties. We express our appreciation for the efforts made by the arbitrators in these early cases, which have facilitated our task.\n\n151.\n\nTwo of the earliest decisions which are pertinent to these issues were handed down the two SGS tribunals, where the facts were somewhat similar to those before us. In *SGS v Pakistan* the tribunal did not address the admissibility of a claim under an umbrella clause in the face of an exclusive jurisdiction clause for the resolution of contractual disputes by reference to arbitration under the law of Pakistan, having concluded that the tribunal did not have jurisdiction to resolve contractual disputes under the umbrella clause of the BIT (we note that in that case the BIT entered into force *after* the relevant contract was adopted).114 That tribunal also concluded that the umbrella clause in the BIT that they were required to interpret did not transform purely contractual claims into BIT claims.115\n\n*SGS v Pakistan*, paras. 156-162.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 163-174.\n\n152.\n\nThe issue of admissibility was addressed by the tribunal in *SGS v Philippines*, in a manner which we have found helpful and with which we largely, but not completely, agree. There too the tribunal was faced with a claim that an umbrella clause allowed it to exercise jurisdiction over claims arising directly under a contract. On the basis of the language of the umbrella clause in the Switzerland/Philippines BIT the Tribunal concluded that \"in principle (and apart from the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the [underlying contract] it was open to SGS to refer the present dispute, as a contractual dispute, to ICSID arbitration under Article VIII(2) of the BIT\".116 The tribunal then turned to the impact of that contract's exclusive jurisdiction clause, which provided that \"All actions concerning disputes in connection with the obligations of either party to this Agreement shall be filed at the Regional Trial Courts of Makati or Manila\" (a formulation which appears on its face to be narrower in scope and effect than Article 9(1) of the Contract at issue in the present case). By a majority, the tribunal proceeded to hold that Article VIII(2) of the BIT was not intended to override an exclusive jurisdiction clause in an investment contract, so far as contractual claims were concerned, and that the balance of opinion in the jurisprudence supported the conclusion that such a clause affected the Tribunal's jurisdiction or the admissibility of the claim.117 In summary, the tribunal ruled that it\n\n\"cannot accept that standard BIT jurisdiction clauses automatically override the binding selection of a forum by the parties to determine their contractual claims. As the *ad hoc* Committee said in the *Vivendi* case:\n\n\u2018where the essential basis of a claim brought before an international tribunal is a breach of contract, the tribunal will give effect to any valid choice of forum clause in the contract.'\"118\n\n*SGS v Philippines*, para. 135.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 140 and 150.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 153.\n\n153.\n\nInvoking the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility, the Tribunal concluded that as a matter of admissibility a party should not be allowed \"to rely on a contract as the basis of its claim when the contract itself refers that claim exclusively to another forum\", unless there were good reasons, such as *force majeure*, which prevented a claimant from complying with the contract.119 Up to this point we fully share the approach adopted by the tribunal in *SGS v Philippines*.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 154. We would add that another exceptional circumstance which might justify a claimant having resort to an umbrella clause (assuming it to provide jurisdiction) to litigate a dispute under a contract which would otherwise go to the forum selected by the exclusive jurisdiction clause, would be if the state party had taken steps to prevent recourse to the agreed forum. That has not happened in the present case: BIVAC has not alleged any impossibility of recourse to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n to resolve the outstanding contractual dispute.\n\n154.\n\nHaving concluded that the tribunal should not exercise its jurisdiction over a contractual claim when the parties had agreed on an exclusive alternative forum, we would have expected the tribunal to dismiss the claim. Indeed, it concluded that \"[n]ormally a claim which is within jurisdiction but inadmissible (e.g., on grounds of failure to exhaust local remedies) will be dismissed, although this will usually be without prejudice to the right of the claimant to start new proceedings if the obstacle to admissibility has been removed (e.g., through exhaustion of local remedies).\"120 The tribunal did not, however, dismiss the claim. Instead, it decided to stay the proceedings \"pending determination of the amount payable, either by agreement between the parties or by the Philippine courts in accordance with [the contract]\".121 The tribunal's true rationale for that decision is not entirely clear from the text. It refers somewhat cryptically to \"substantial efforts\" on the part of the claimant to settle the claim through negotiations and the existence of \"the factual predicate of a determination\" by the Philippine court of the total amount owed by the respondent, circumstances which led it to conclude that the fixing of the amount payable under the contract - whether by definitive agreement between the parties or by proceedings before the courts of the Philippines -\"should not require the bringing of a new ICSID claim by SGS\".122 The logic of this approach is not immediately apparent to us: if the parties to the contract have agreed on an exclusive jurisdiction to resolve a dispute under the contract, whether it relates to the amount that is to be paid or the justifications raised by one party for non payment, then it is exclusively for that forum to resolve all aspects of the dispute under the exclusive jurisdiction clause. If any agreement between the parties on the amounts outstanding under the contract does not resolve the contractual dispute, then exclusive jurisdiction continues to vest in the agreed forum and the ICSID tribunal is barred from exercising jurisdiction. Whatever facts may have pertained in the case of *SGS v Philippines*, or whatever other considerations may have given rise to the Tribunal's decision to stay the proceedings rather than dismiss the claim, it is not immediately apparent to us the nature or extent of argument that was addressed to this point by the parties, or what truly motivated the decision.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 171.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 175.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 173-4.\n\n155.\n\nAgainst this background BIVAC has referred to a large number of decisions and awards in support of its argument that the tribunal has jurisdiction under the umbrella clause and there is no bar to the admissibility of the claim. In its Post-Hearing Memorial it focused on three cases in its treatment of jurisdiction,123 as well as the decision in *SGS v Philippines* in its arguments on admissibility. We consider the three cases on jurisdiction for the purposes of completeness.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 91-93.\n\n156.\n\nThe first award referred to is *Eureko v Poland*, where the tribunal rejected Poland's argument on the inadmissibility of a claim under the umbrella clause in circumstances in which there was an exclusive jurisdiction clause for contractual disputes: since the Claimant \"advances claims for breach of Treaty. every one of those claims must be heard and judged by this Tribunal\".124 As to the violations of the contract at issue in that case, the tribunal concluded that Poland's actions and inactions that were in breach of its obligations under the BIT - those held to be unfair and inequitable and expropriatory in effect - were also in breach of the umbrella clause and the underlying contractual obligations. The award provided no assessment or analysis of the contractual provisions that were in issue in that case, so that it appears that its conclusions are to be understood against the background of the particular facts that were there in issue.\n\n*Eureko v Poland*, Partial Award and Dissenting Opinion, at para. 113. The tribunal indicated that it had reviewed and considered the other cases cited by the Respondent in support of its jurisdictional objection, but that these decisions did not lead the Tribunal to any other conclusion: *ibid*., at note 7.\n\n157.\n\nThe second award invoked by BIVAC is *Noble Ventures v Romania*.125 Although that award dealt with the meaning and effect of an umbrella clause, there is no indication that the underlying contract included an exclusive jurisdiction clause or that there was any argument as to admissibility. Accordingly that award can provide no assistance to BIVAC on this issue.\n\n*Noble Ventures, Inc. v Romania*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/01/11), Award, 12 October 2005, (B\u00f6ckstiegel (P), Lever, Dupuy).\n\n158.\n\nThe third case invoked by BIVAC is *Siemens v Argentina*. In its decision on jurisdiction the tribunal did not address the issue of admissibility with regards to the umbrella clause. In a single line it ruled that \"The dispute as formulated by the Claimant is a dispute under the Treaty\", and on that basis found that it had jurisdiction.126 At the merits phase the tribunal found that the Claimant was not a party to the contract, and accordingly rejected the claim as regards breach of the contract.127 The decision therefore provides no support for BIVAC's position as to admissibility.\n\n*Siemens AG v Argentine Republic*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/8, Decision on Jurisdiction, 3 August 2004, (Rigo Sureda (P), Brower, Bello Janeiro), para. 180.\n\n*Siemens AG v.

As noted above, however, the Tribunal in *SGS v Philippines* the tribunal did not follow this course, and chose instead to stay the proceedings. We were not presented with arguments by the parties as to what course we should follow in the event that we upheld jurisdiction under Article 3(4) of the BIT but decided that the claim was inadmissible. We note that no proceedings have been initiated by BIVAC before the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n, despite the passage of many years and, perhaps surprisingly if the evidence before us is to be believed, in the face of Paraguay's persistent and unexplained failure to comply with its contractual obligation to pay. We note also that BIVAC has not sought to explain why it has not had recourse to the forum agreed by the Contract for the resolution of disputes, and that it has not put any evidence before the Tribunal to suggest that justice would not be done before the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n.\n\n161.\n\nIn such circumstances it might be concluded that a stay of these proceedings in relation to the claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT would be unwarranted, and the proper course would be to dismiss the claim. Against that, we have heard no argument from the Respondent seeking to dissuade us from adopting the approach taken by the Tribunal in *SGS v Philippines*, which decided to stay proceedings. In the absence of argument by either party, and having found that the claim under Article 3(4) is inadmissible, we consider that the most prudent approach is to join to the merits the limited issue of whether the Tribunal should *either* dismiss the claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT *or* stay the exercise of jurisdiction indefinitely or for some other period of time or until some other circumstances pertain.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n162.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal decides that:\n\n(a) it has no jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 6 of the BIT;\n\n(b) it has jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 3(1) of the BIT, and that claim is admissible;\n\n(c) it has jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 3(4) of the BIT but that the claim is inadmissible, and it joins to the merits the issue of whether the consequence of the decision on inadmissibility is that the claim should be dismissed or the exercise of jurisdiction stayed;\n\n(d) the claim raised by Paraguay in its letter of 5 December 2008 as to the standing of BIVAC to bring the claims is joined to the merits; and\n\n(e) all other questions, including those concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the parties determination are reserved for future determination."}, {"Title": "Further Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction", "Type": "Jurisdiction", "Date": "2012-10-09T00:00:00Z", "Opinions": [], "Content": "Further Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction\n----------------------------------------------\n\n**1.

The Arbitral Tribunal**\n----------------------------\n\n5.\n\nThe parties were unable to agree on the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. Therefore, it was constituted in accordance with Articles 37(2)(b) and 38 of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (\"ICSID Convention\") and Articles 2 to 5 of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (\"ICSID Arbitration Rules\"). By letter dated 14 June 2007 BIVAC appointed Mr. L. Yves Fortier, C.C., O.Q., Q.C., LL.D, a Canadian national as arbitrator. Mr. Fortier accepted the appointment on 20 June 2007. By letter dated 9 July 2007 Paraguay appointed Professor Philippe Sands QC, a British and French national. Professor Sands accepted the appointment on 13 July 2007. Following consultations with the parties, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (\"ICSID\" or \"the Centre\") appointed Professor Dr. Rolf Knieper, a German national, as the presiding arbitrator. Professor Knieper accepted the appointment on 10 March 2008.\n\n6.\n\nBy letter dated 10 March 2008, ICSID informed the parties that as of that date the Tribunal had been constituted and that the proceedings were deemed to have commenced. During the first session of the Tribunal which was held with the parties on 20 May 2008 in Washington, D.C., the parties agreed that the Tribunal had been properly constituted in accordance with the provisions of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration Rules in force since April 2006, which are applicable to these proceedings.\n\n7.\n\nAfter Mr. Gonzalo Flores, ICSID, and Mr. Sergio Puig de la Parra, ICSID, Ms. Mercedes Cordido-Freytes de Kurowski was appointed to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.\n\n**3. Procedural History and Background**\n----------------------------------------\n\n**3.1. The Developments up to the Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction**\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n8.\n\nOn 20 February 2007 ICSID received a Request for Arbitration from BIVAC dated 16 February 2007. In its request BIVAC asserted that it had made investments in Paraguay which were protected under the Agreement between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Paraguay on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments (\"the Treaty\" or the \"BIT\").1\n\nExhibit CE-66, (signed on 29 October 1992; entered into force on 1 August 1994).\n\n9.\n\nIn its request and in further submissions BIVAC asserted that Paraguay violated various obligations under the Treaty. BIVAC had concluded a contract with the Ministry of Finance of Paraguay on 6 May 1996 for the provision of technical services for pre-shipment inspection of imports into Paraguay (\"the Contract\")2. The Contract was to run for a term of three years, from 15 July 1996, which term was to be renewed periodically, unless one of the parties gave written notice of its intention not to renew the Contract no less than four months before the expiration of the term (Article 8.2).3 The Contract was terminated in June 1999 upon mutual agreement of the parties. BIVAC asserts that it carried out some 70,000 inspections over the three year period and that it had issued 35 invoices. It alleges that 19 of the invoices remained unpaid amounting to US$ 22,016,142 and that the last payment made by the Ministry of Finance was in March 1999.4 BIVAC estimates that as of 31 August 2011 the total amount due under the outstanding invoices together with accrued interest is US$ 63,969,775.13.5\n\nContract between the Ministry of Finance of the Government of the Republic of Paraguay and Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V., regarding the rendering of Technical Services for the Pre-Shipment Inspection of Imports, (dated 6 May 1996), Exhibit CE-6.A (Contract in English) // CE-6.B (in Spanish).\n\nBIVAC Memorial (dated 27 November 2009), para. 6.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 56.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief (dated 23 September 2011), para 141 and Annex 3.\n\n10.\n\nThe Centre registered the Request for Arbitration on 11 April 2007 and duly notified the parties thereof after having been provided with explanations from BIVAC as to the qualification of its activities as an investment and to the relationship between the dispute settlement provisions in the Treaty and in the Contract.\n\n11.\n\nParaguay has consistently objected to the jurisdiction of the Centre and the Arbitral Tribunal. It has insisted that neither the appointment of an arbitrator nor the agreement to the constitution of the Tribunal were to be interpreted as its consent to jurisdiction. It asserted *inter alia* that Paraguay had not agreed to arbitration before ICSID, that its relationship with BIVAC was based on an administrative contract which is not covered by the Treaty, that BIVAC had not made an investment in the territory of Paraguay and that Article 9.1 of the Contract contains an exclusive dispute settlement mechanism. Article 9.1 states:\n\n\"Any conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to this Contract, non compliance, resolution or invalidity shall be submitted to the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n pursuant to Paraguayan Law.\"\n\n12.\n\nDuring its first session the Tribunal decided that:\n\n\"In view of Paraguay' objections, after hearing from both parties, the Tribunal decided as follows (as reflected in the Tribunal's Procedural Order No 1 of June 12, 2008, amended by letter of the Secretary to the parties of June 25, 2008 (attached to these Minutes as Annexes 2 and 3, respectively)):\n\n- The Respondent's Preliminary Objections, as set out in the documents dated April 9, 2008 and May 20, 2008, shall be treated as a preliminary question;\n\n- The proceedings on the merits are suspended until such time as the Tribunal has adopted a decision on the Preliminary Objections raised by the Respondent, as provided by Article 41, paragraph 2 of the Convention\".\n\nThis was recorded in the Minutes of the session signed by the Secretary and the President on 6 and 7 July 2008.\n\n13.\n\nSubsequently, the Tribunal received the Claimant's Counter-Memorial dated 3 July 2008, the Respondent's Reply dated 18 August 2008 and the Claimant's Rejoinder dated 2 October 2008. All were submitted within the time limits prescribed by the Tribunal. A hearing on jurisdiction was held in Washington D.C. on 11 November 2008. In addition both partiessubmitted post-hearing briefs, the Respondent on 8 December 2008 and the Claimant on 22 December 2008, as agreed by the Tribunal. As set out below, the Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction was rendered by the Tribunal on 29 May 2009.6\n\nDecision of the Tribunal on Objections to Jurisdiction (\"Decision on Objections to Jurisdction\"), dated 29 May 2009.\n\n14.\n\nBy letter dated 5 December 2008, the Respondent further requested the Tribunal to dismiss the claim on the ground that BIVAC lacked standing. Paraguay asserted that the real party in interest was BIVAC International S.A. (\"BIVAC International\") and not BIVAC BV. By letter dated 11 December 2008, BIVAC responded to Paraguay's letter and requested the Tribunal to reject Paraguay's new submission as inadmissible on the grounds that it raised new arguments on objections to jurisdiction, contradicting the Tribunal's decision not to allow any new arguments to be made at the preliminary stage of the proceedings. It also asserted that BIVAC BV, the Dutch company, was the party to the Contract and thus the real party in interest. The Tribunal invited Paraguay to give its views on the issue, which it did by letter dated 19 December 2008. BIVAC reiterated its request that Paraguay's new arguments as to standing should be declared inadmissible by letter dated 22 December 2008.\n\n**3.2. The Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction**\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n15.\n\nThe salient features of the Decision of 29 May 2009 are reproduced here to assist in understanding the procedure leading to this Further Decision and its motivation.\n\n16.\n\nThe Tribunal ruled on the jurisdictional issues as follows:\n\n\"(a) it has no jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 6 of the BIT;\n\n(b) it has jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 3(1) of the BIT, and that claim is admissible;\n\n(c) it has jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 3(4) of the BIT but that the claim is inadmissible, and it joins to the merits the issue of whether the consequence of the decision on inadmissibility is that the claim should be dismissed or the exercise of jurisdiction stayed;\n\n(d) the claim raised by Paraguay in its letter of 5 December 2008 as to the standing of BIVAC to bring the claims is joined to the merits; and\n\n(e) all other questions, including those concerning the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the parties determination are reserved for future determination.\"7\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 162.\n\n***3.2.1. Operative Paragraph A***\n----------------------------------\n\n17.\n\nArticle 6 of the BIT stipulates that Dutch investments in Paraguay would not be expropriated except if carried out for a public purpose, on a non-discriminatory basis and accompanied by the payment of just compensation. The provision reads:\n\n\"Neither Contracting Party shall take any measures depriving, directly or indirectly, nationals of the other Contracting Party of their investments unless the following conditions are complied with:\n\n(a) the measures are taken in the public interest and under due process of law;\n\n(b) the measures are not discriminatory or contrary to any undertaking which the Contracting Party which takes such measures may have given;\n\n(c) the measures are taken against just compensation..,\"8\n\nExhibit CE-66.\n\n18.\n\nThe Tribunal held that \"in circumstances in which there is no dispute that the alleged contractual debt continues to exist, or that the forum for the resolution of contractual dispute remains fully available, the materials put forward by BIVAC do not raise the possibility of an arguable case of expropriation. To take the standard argued for by the Claimant, the Tribunal is not satisfied *prima facie* that the Claimant's claims are capable of constituting the alleged breach of the Treaty.\"9\n\nDecision on Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 117.\n\n***3.2.1. Operative Paragraph B***\n----------------------------------\n\n19.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the BIT stipulates that Dutch investment in Paraguay would be granted fair and equitable treatment. The provision reads:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.\"10\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n20.\n\nThe Tribunal found that BIVAC had advanced a factual and legal case which, if established, would be capable of giving rise to a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT. It was satisfied that based on the Claimant's description of the circumstances of the claim and Respondent's reaction it could provisionally conclude that Paraguay's failure to challenge the validity of the Contract, BIVAC's compliance with its obligations, and the level of indebtedness amounted to an acknowledgement of the debt. Without expressing any view on the question of whether a persistent failure to pay an outstanding debt could in itself ever amount to a violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard, or whether Paraguay had acted not only like an ordinary contracting party but had exercised governmental power (\"*puissance publique*\"), the Tribunal concluded that these questions were arguable and relevant for the merits and that this finding sufficed at the preliminary stage to establish its jurisdiction.\n\n21.\n\nThe Tribunal further held that the dispute resolution clause set out in Article 9 of the Contract was no bar to the admissibility of the claim since it was not based on the application and performance of the Contract as such. Rather, it was based on Paraguay's alleged exercise of sovereign power in a manner that violated the Treaty standard and was no mere breach of contract.11\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 123-127.\n\n***3.2.1. Operative Paragraph C***\n----------------------------------\n\n22.\n\nArticle 3(4) of the BIT provides that \"[e]ach Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of the other Contracting Party.\"\n\n23.\n\nThe Tribunal had concluded this claim was inadmissible, because\n\n\"(1) In Article 9(1) of the Contract the parties agreed to a legally binding exclusive jurisdiction clause which provided for the resolution of \"any conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to [the] Contract\" only by the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n;\n\n(2) Article 3(4) of the BIT does not override the exclusive jurisdiction clause of Article 9(1) of the Contract;\n\n(3) \"the fundamental basis of the claim\" presented by BIVAC in respect of Article 3(4) of the BIT concerns a \"conflict, controversy or claim\" arising from or produced in relation to the Contract;\n\n(4) having regard to the need to respect the autonomy of the parties, BIVAC cannot rely on the Contract as the basis of a claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT when the Contract itself refers that claim exclusively to another forum, in the absence of exceptional reasons which might make the contractual forum unavailable;\n\n(5) the proper forum for the resolution of the contractual claim that has been raised under Article 3(4) of the BIT is the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n, applying the law of Paraguay.\"12\n\n*Ibid*., para. 159.\n\n24.\n\nDespite its finding on inadmissibility the Tribunal decided that it was not in a position to dismiss the claim. It decided instead to stay the proceedings on the grounds that it had not been provided with arguments by the parties as to the course to be followed in the event that jurisidiction is upheld under Article 3(4) of the BIT. The Tribunal therefore decided to join the question of an alternative course to the merits in order to give the parties the opportunity to present arguments as to the the appropriate course of action to be followed, and to allow BIVAC the possibility to explain why it had not had recourse to Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n, the forum agreed in the Contract.13\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 160-161.\n\n***3.2.1. Operative Paragraph D***\n----------------------------------\n\n25.\n\nThe Respondent's objection to jurisdiction *ratione personae* was first raised in its letter dated 5 December 2008, after the hearing on jurisdiction. The Tribunal decided that this was too late to allow for a substantive debate of these new arguments at the preliminary stage. A decision on this matter would have been inconsistent with basic principles of due process and procedural economy. The Tribunal had therefore decided, in accordance with Article 41(2) of the ICSID Convention, to join this new objection to the merits.\n\n26.\n\nThe Decision on Jurisdiction of 29 May 2009, has therefore left the Arbitral Tribunal with the following matters to be resolved in the award on the merits:\n\n\u2022 whether the Claimant had ius standi in the proceedings;\n\n\u2022 whether the Respondent had violated its obligation of fair and equitable treatment in addition to an eventual breach of contract;\n\n\u2022 whether the inadmissible claim for a violation of the umbrella clause should be dismissed or stayed;\n\n\u2022 how costs and expenses should be allocated.\n\n**3.3. The Developments up to the Further Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction**\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n27.\n\nOn 29 May 2009, the Tribunal invited the parties by letter to agree on a timetable for the next phase of the proceedings and inform the Tribunal of such agreement or, failing an agreement, to inform the Tribunal by 12 June 2009 of their respective positions. This date was extended to 26 June 2009, then to 28 July 2009 and then to 10 August 2009, on each occasion at the request of both Parties.\n\n28.\n\nAs the Parties did not respond to the Tribunal's invitation, it issued Procedural Order No. 2 dated 12 August 2009, which fixed the timetable for next phase of the proceedings. The Claimant was to submit a Memorial on the merits no later than 13 October 2009, as well as its pleadings with respect to BIVAC's *ius standi* and to the consequences of the inadmissibility of the claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT; the Respondent was to submit a Counter-Memorial on the merits no later than 14 December 2009; the Claimant was to submit a Reply no later than 28 January 2010 and the Respondent was to submit a Rejoinder no later than 15 March 2010.\n\n29.\n\nFollowing a common request from the Parties communicated to the Tribunal on 30 September 2009, by letter dated 7 October 2009, the Tribunal granted an extension of time for the submission of the Parties' written pleadings: the Claimant's Memorial was to be filed on 27 November 2009, the Respondent's Counter-Memorial on 22 January 2010, the Reply on 5 March 2010 and the Rejoinder on 16 April 2010. The Tribunal further indicated that it would be available for hearings during the last week of July 2010.\n\n30.\n\nThe Claimant duly submitted its Memorial on 27 November 2009. Following a further request from the Respondent for another extension of time on 27 January 2010 to which Claimant had given its conditioned agreement, the Tribunal decided by letter dated 29 January 2010 to further extend the time limits. The Respondent's CounterMemorial was to be submitted no later than 12 March 2010, the Claimant's Reply by 7 May 2010 and the Respondent's Rejoinder by 25 June 2010. The dates for the hearing were unchanged.\n\n31.\n\nThe Respondent submitted its Counter-Memorial on 12 March 2010.\n\n32.\n\nOn 6 May 2010, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to a suspension of the arbitration to allow for settlement negotiations. Following receipt of the Respondent's confirmation of its agreement to suspend, the Tribunal granted a suspension until 4 August 2010. The hearing due to be held in July 2010 was postponed until a later date. The Tribunal acceeded to a request made by the Parties on 29 July 2010 for an extension of the suspension until 4 November 2010. By letter dated 29 October 2010, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that no request for a further suspension would be made.\n\n33.\n\nThe Claimant and the Respondent agreed on a new procedural calendar and communicated the dates by letter dated 18 November 2010 and by e-mail of 19 November 2010, respectively. The timetable was then fixed by the Tribunal's letter dated 20 November 2010 as follows: the Claimant was to submit its Reply on 11 February 2011 and Respondent its Rejoinder on 9 June 2011. Both Parties duly submitted their pleadings within these timelimits.\n\n34.\n\nThe dates for the hearing on the merits were fixed for 5 to 7 July 2011 by letter of the Tribunal dated 20 November 2010, and confirmed during a telephone conference between the President of the Tribunal, the Parties and the Secretary of the Tribunal on 9 June 2011. During the conference call the date of 15 September 2011 was fixed for post-hearing briefs for both Parties.\n\n35.\n\nThe delays to these proceedings are considerable as noted by counsel for the Claimant during the hearing in the opening statement that \"here we are, four years later, in ICSID\".14 The delays are the result of repeated requests for extensions of time for submissions and for the suspension of the proceedings by the Parties.\n\nHearing on the Merits, 5-7 July 2011, transcript, p. 93.\n\n36.\n\nThe hearing was held in Washington D.C. from 5 to 7 July 2011. BIVAC was represented by Mr. Nigel Blackaby, Mr. Lluis Paradell, Ms. Caroline Richard and Mr. Nigel Best from Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, Mr. Pablo Lu from Mers\u00e1n Abogados and Mr. Andrew Hibbert from BIVAC BV. Paraguay was represented by Dr. Jos\u00e9 Enrique Garc\u00eda \u00c1valos, Procurador General de la Rep\u00fablica, Mr. Ra\u00fal Sapena, Lawyer of the Treasury, Mr. Benigno Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez, Member of the Directorate of the Central Bank of Paraguay, Mr. Brian C. Dunning and Mr. David N. Cinotti from Venable LLP.\n\n37.\n\nDuring the hearing and in consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal modified its initial timetable for the conduct of the hearing, but both Parties were offered equal time to give an oral presentation of their submissions. The oral arguments made on behalf of BIVAC were presented by Messrs. Blackaby and Paradell, and on behalf of Paraguay by Messrs. Dunning, Cinotti and Dr. Garc\u00eda-\u00c1valos. Both Parties used slideshows during the hearing which were also submitted to the Tribunal.\n\n38.\n\nAt the end of the hearing both Parties expressed their satisfaction with the conduct of the hearing and confirmed to have been treated equally and granted full opportunity to present their respective arguments.15\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 605.\n\n39.\n\nOn 12 September 2011, the Parties asked for an extension of the time limit for the post-hearing briefs until 23 September 2011. This extension was granted by the Tribunal, and both post-hearing briefs were submitted on time. During the hearing the date for cost submissions was fixed for 14 October 2011, which was accepted and respected by both Parties.16\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 607.\n\n40.\n\nOn 2 December 2011, the Tribunal addressed the following letter to the Parties:\n\n\"When the Tribunal prepared internal deliberations and consulted the *C\u00f3digo Civil* which had been introduced into the proceedings for different reasons, the question arose whether BIVAC's contractual claim might be time barred, in accordance with Articles 657 to 668 of the *C\u00f3digo*.\n\nThe Tribunal invites both parties to react to the following questions and this until Thursday, December 22, 2011 at 5:00 p.m. (Washington, D.C. time).\n\n1. Is Claimant's contractual claim time barred according to Paraguayan law, and if so, since when?\n\n2. Does the answer to question 1) in any way have any impact upon the question of Paraguay's alleged violation of its treaty obligation to treat BIVAC fairly and equitably, and BIVAC's alleged claim under the BIT?\"\n\n41.\n\nOn 23 December 2011, both the Claimant and Respondent submitted their reponse to the questions posed by the Tribunal, after their common request for a one day extension of the time limit had been granted by the Tribunal.\n\n42.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the contractual claim is not time barred. Even if the period of prescription under the Civil Code of either four or two years might have been exceeded, the repeated unequivocal acknowledgment of the debt by the Respondent and then the request of arbitration had interrupted the limitation period until this day. Moreover, the problem of time bar according to Paraguayan law is of no significance since the Claimant pursues a claim under international law for which Paraguayan contract law is not applicable, and not a contractual claim.\n\n43.\n\nThe Respondent submits that the normal period of limitation is ten years. Like the Claimant it asserts that the period of limitation has been interrupted before it had ended.\n\n**4. The Reasons for this Decision**\n------------------------------------\n\n**4.1. The Uncontested and the Controversial Factual Contours of the Dispute**\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n***4.1.1. The Contract: its Conclusion and Termination***\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n44.\n\nIn 1995, upon recommendation of the International Monetary Fund, the Government of President Juan Carlos Wasmosy implemented measures to remedy tax evasion, among which it established a \"programme of pre-shipment inspection\" aimed at optimizing the rate of collection of import duties and taxes.17 Following a selection process, the Ministry of Finance selected two bidders, the Bureau Veritas group and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance SA (\"SGS\"), to render these services.18\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Bojanovich, paras. 8-9; Preamble to the Contract, Exhibit CE-6\n\nReport of the General Controller of the Republic to the Ministry of Finance regarding the process for concluding contracts with BIVAC and SGS, dated 22 February 1999, Exhibit CE-71; Report No 1/96 of the Legal Advisor to the Presidency of the Paraguayan Republic to the Secretary General of the President of the Paraguayan Republic, dated 31 January 1996, Exhibit CE-4; Preamble to the Contract, Exhibit CE-6; see also BIVAC Memorial, paras.17-19.\n\n45.\n\nOn 31 January 1996, the Government issued Executive Decree No. 12,311 authorizing the Ministry of Finance to enter into these contracts.19 On 6 May 1996, the Ministry of Finance entered into the Contract with BIVAC for the provision of such technical services for pre-shipment inspection of imports in Paraguay. The Decree refers to \"BIVAC INTERNATIONAL (BUREAU VERITAS GROUP)\" of France, rather than BIVAC B.V., and the Contract identifies \"Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V.\" as the contracting partner.20\n\nExecutive Decree No. 12,311, Exhibit CE-5.\n\nContract, Exhibit CE-6, Cover page.\n\n46.\n\nThe customs inspection and clearance system that BIVAC was to operate and the services it was to provide were regulated by the State, in particular through Resolution No. 1171/96 \"which regulates the operational procedure for the pre-shipment inspection of imports\", and its subsequent modifications.21\n\nResolution No. 1171, dated 3 July 1996, Exhibit CE-51Resolution No. 2037, dated 25 November 1996, Exhibit CE-54; and Resolution No. 1579, dated 10 September 1996, Exhibit CE-53\n\n47.\n\nBy the terms of the Contract, BIVAC was *inter alia* required to: (i) physically identify the goods prior to shipment; (ii) appraise the reasonableness of the price charged by the seller; (iii) estimate the customs value; (iv) issue certificates of inspection; (v) train Paraguayan personnel; and (vi) assist in the establishment of a database. BIVAC was allowed to open and maintain a liaison office in Paraguay, which was constituted as \"BIVAC Paraguay S.A.\". The Ministry of Finance was obliged to pay fees for the technical services, which were to be calculated as a percentage of the FOB value of the goods set out in the certificates of inspection. Such fees were to be invoiced on a monthly basis to the Ministry of Finance in U.S. dollars and paid within 20 days of receipt to BIVAC's offshore bank account. The Contract provided that any differences arising with respect to the documentation that accompanied the invoices were to be resolved promptly and the undisputed amount of the invoice paid forthwith.22\n\nContract, Exhibit CE-6Articles 2-4.\n\n48.\n\nThe Contract also provided that Paraguayan law was applicable and that disputes in relation to the Contract with regard to its \"non compliance, resolution or invalidity\" were to be submitted to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n.23 As set out below, after a dispute had arisen under the Contract the Claimant chose not to bring a claim to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n. It has not argued in its Application or in its written pleadings prior to the hearing that these tribunals were not available, or that it was barred from access to the Paraguayan courts to pursue its claim based on a breach of contract.24 Rather, in response to a question from the Tribunal, it stated that the decision not to go the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n was a \"commercial decision\".25Instead, the Claimant decided to pursue its claim through a different channel as the Respondent allegedly not only breached the Contract but also violated the fair and equitable treatment standard set out in the Treaty.26 The Respondent objects to the Claimant's characterization of the Paraguayan judiciary and insists that \"Paraguayan courts offer a fair and independent process to enforce BIVAC's rights and remedies\",27 including an equilibrated system of costs and fees.28\n\n*Ibid.,* Article 9.\n\nHearing on the Merits, 5-7 July 2011, transcript, pp. 252-253.\n\n*Ibid.,* p. 91.\n\nHearing on the Merits, 5-7 July 2011, transcript, p. 98 ss.; BIVAC Memorial, paras. 247-251; BIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, paras.

This issue is addressed below at paras. 199-201.\n\n49.\n\nOver the course of these proceedings both Parties have revised their characterization of the Contract. The Claimant initially emphasized the character of the private investment and the Contract as obliging the Parties to pay service fees in exchange of services and also involving rights granted under public law.29 It later shifted its approach, emphasising that the Contract \"was, from its inception, an eminently public law contract\".30 For its part, Paraguay initially insisted on the characterization of the Contract as being administrative in character,31 but later insisted on the commercial character of the contractual relationship, given that \"Sovereigns and their organs contract with private parties routinely in nearly every economic sector\".32 It stresses that in line with modern doctrine, jurisdiction and international conventions the quality of a contract must be determined according to its nature and not its purpose or motive.33\n\nRequest for Arbitration, (dated 16 February 2007), para. 11.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\nParaguay Note of 8 April 2008.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 57-67; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 5.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 98.\n\n50.\n\nInitially, the Government of President Wasmosy complied with its obligations to make regular payments upon receipt of BIVAC's invoices. However, the evidence shows that delays in payments began as early as November 1996.34 By mid-1998, a number of unpaid invoices had begun to accumulate and Mr. Bojanovich of BIVAC wrote to the Minister of Finance to request payment of certain outstanding invoices issued after June 1997.35 The Respondent's then Minister of Finance, Miguel Angel Maidana Zayas, acknowledged the total sum of the \"outstanding debt of the Paraguayan State in favour of BIVAC\"36 and expressed his desire to comply with the payment provisions in the Contract for the services provided in 1998.37 With regards to the outstanding debt for 1997, the Minister indicated that his office was examining legal mechanisms to \"regulate\" such debt to the satisfaction of the Parties' interests.38\n\nJoint letter from BIVAC and SGS to the Ministry of Finance, dated 31 March 1997, Exhibit RE-15; and Paraguay CounterMemorial, para. 56.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Bojanovich, para. 27; BIVAC Memorial, para. 51.\n\nThe outstanding debt owed to BIVAC by the Paraguayan State, deducing the amount of the credit notes from the total amount of the invoices from June 1997 to June 1998, amounted to US$12,519,353.16 for June to December 1997 and US$6,449,327.55 for March to June 1998, for a total amount of US$18,968,680.71: see Exhibit CE-68.\n\nLetter No. 665 from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC BV, dated 31 July 1998, Exhibit CE-68; BIVAC Memorial, para. 53.\n\nExhibit CE-68 (\"con respecto a la deuda acumulada del a\u00f1o 1997 le informamos que este Ministerio se encuentra estudiando y analizando la posibilidod y mecanismos legales que permitan la regulaci\u00f3n de esta deuda en una concertaci\u00f3n de intereses\") and Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, para 66.\n\n51.\n\nThe new Government of President Ra\u00fal Cubas took office in August 1998. Investigations into the manner in which the previous regime had entered into the Contract were instigated.39 Thereafter, from September 1998 to June 1999, none of the new invoices issued by BIVAC were paid. BIVAC made several requests for payment to President Cubas' Minister of Finance, Mr. Gerhard Doll, but no payments were forthcoming. In January 1999, BIVAC sent the Minister a formal demand for payment by certified telegram.40 Minister Doll responded a week later objecting to all documents attached to the invoices submitted by BIVAC (from June to December 1997 and from March 1998 onwards), on the basis of alleged breaches of Clause 5 of the Contract.41 Minister Doll's telegram did not specify BIVAC's alleged breaches of the Contract. Minister Doll referred to Article 4.5 of the Contract42 and convened BIVAC to a meeting to resolve the Parties' discrepancies with respect to the documentation that accompanied the invoices. In March 1999, following a meeting between the Parties, a number of invoices dating back to 1997 were paid, amounting to more than $7 million. This was the last payment received by BIVAC.43\n\nThe \"Special Examination on the contractual process of the companies BIVAC and SGS\" was instigated through resolutions adopted in August and September 1998.

The Alleged Acknowledgment and Repudiation of the Debt under the Contract by the Respondent***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n53.\n\nOn 7 June 1999, given the decision not to renew the Contract and \"taking into account the accumulation of financial commitments that the Paraguay State will assume on account of the same\", Minister of Finance Federico Zayas, appointed by President Cubas' successor, President Luis \u00c1ngel Gonz\u00e1lez Macchi, proposed that the termination date of the Contract be brought forward to 9 June 1999 (instead of 15 July 1999 as set forth in the Contract).47 Minister Zayas indicated that \"[a]s of this date the obligations emerging for both parties related to the Contract for the Rendering of Services shall cease, except the rights already acquired\".48\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC Paraguay SA, dated 7 June 1999, Exhibit CE-19A; BIVAC Memorial, para. 60; BIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 31.\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC Paraguay SA, dated 7 June 1999, Exhibit CE-19.\n\n54.\n\nOn 8 June 1999, BIVAC agreed not to accept additional inspection requests from importers as of 9 June 1999. However, BIVAC indicated that it would not discontinue ongoing operations and that it would submit the corresponding invoices to Paraguay. BIVAC reiterated its request for payment of the sums due under the Contract, which it claimed amounted to $US 21,434,956.97, as of 30 April 1999.49\n\nLetter from BIVAC to the Ministry of Finance, dated 8 June 1999, Exhibit CE-72.\n\n55.\n\nOn 14 June 1999, in order to negotiate payment, Minister Zayas proposed a 50% discount on the outstanding balance of the debt, indicating that such balance would be set out in due course.50 In a subsequent meeting between the Parties' representatives, the Minister offered to pay in Government bonds.51 On 6 August 1999, BIVAC expressed its willingness to accept payment of the whole or a part of the outstanding debt in Government bonds.52\n\nLetter No. 1237 from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC BV, dated 14 June 1999, Exhibit CE-73; BIVAC's Memorial, para 63.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Bojanovich, para 42; BIVAC Memorial, para 64.\n\nLetter from BIVAC to the Ministry of Finance, dated 6 August 1999, Exhibit -CE-75.\n\n56.\n\nAround the same time, the Ministry of Finance issued a list of nineteen \"outstanding invoices issued by BIVAC as of June 1999\", calculating the \"total debt as of 30 June 1999\" amounted to US$22,016,140.52 (for the years 1997 to 1999). Another list entitled \"outstanding debt with BIVAC held at the Paymaster's Department of the Ministry of Finance\" and dated 6 August 1999 reproduces the same total amount, specifying that no credit notes had been issued for this period.53\n\nList of outstanding invoices prepared by the Ministry of Finance, dated 6 August 1999, Exhibit CE-22.

Minister Zayas referred to its previous letter of 2 December 1999 and mentioned that no payment could be done until the National Congress had passed a law authorizing payment.55 In September 2000, the Minister told the press that the debts owed to BIVAC and SGS had been unlawfully assumed by the Wasmosy Government, since they had not been authorized by a law of Congress, but were rather entered into pursuant to a Decree.56 Minister Zayas's tenure ended without payment being effected and the recovery of the debt fell to be pursued with the next Minister of Finance, Mr. Francisco Oviedo Britez.57\n\nLetter No. 2702 from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC BV, dated 2 December 1999, Exhibit CE-24A; BIVAC's Memorial, paras. 66-67.\n\nLetter No. 2772 from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC BV, dated 13 December 1999, Exhibit CE-77; BIVAC Memorial, para. 69.\n\nPress Article, \"*Deuda asumida por Wasmosy con SGS y BIVAC es ilegal*\", ABC Color, dated 16 September 2000, Exhibit CE-91; BIVAC Memorial, para 70.\n\nBIVAC Memorial, paras. 72-73.\n\n58.\n\nIn a letter to BIVAC dated 13 February 2001, Minister Britez noted the State's momentary inability to make any payment until the conclusion of the ongoing investigation and the completion of account reconciliation.

The letter also invited BIVAC's representatives to settlement negotiations.59 Disputing what is alleged by BIVAC,60 Paraguay contends that this letter is not an unequivocal promise to pay the debt61.\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC, dated 19 April 2004, Exhibit CE-31.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 49.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 70.\n\n60.\n\nOn 3 June 2004, the Ministry of Finance adopted Resolution No. 274, by which it established a new Commission to determine whether there was non-compliance with the Contract and whether payment of the pending debts was in order.62 The Commission concluded that it lacked competence to decide the matter, following which the investigation was reassigned to the National Customs Office, pursuant to Resolution No. 43 adopted by the Ministry of Finance on 3 February 2005.63 Although the Commission concluded that the Contract had been complied with,64 no payment was made. On 22 June 2007, the Ministry of Interior issued Decree No. 10485, opening a new investigation into the Contract.65\n\nResolution No. 274 of the Ministry of Finance, dated 3 June 2004, Exhibit CE-32.\n\nResolution No. 43 of the Ministry of Finance, dated 3 February 2005, Exhibit CE-34.\n\nReport No. 377 of the General Customs Office, dated 30 March 2005, Exhibit CE-35.\n\nDecree No. 10485 from the Ministry of the Interior, dated 22 June 2007, Exhibit CE-136.\n\n61.\n\nBIVAC alleges that within a period of several years successive administrations have vacillated between on the one hand, acknowledging the obligation to pay the debt and on the other, commissioning repetitive and overlapping investigations into the validity and performance of the Contract; that most of these investigations have led to the conclusion that the Contract was valid and that BIVAC had fully complied with its obligations;66 that successive Governments have failed to abide by their findings and have refused to make any payment; that they have escalated the unpaid debt into a political issue; and that all successive administrations have refused to take responsibility and make payment.67 According to the Claimant, since both the validity of the Contract and BIVAC's performance under the Contract have been recognized, the consistent non-payment and \"Paraguay's conduct constitute[s] an effective political repudiation of the debt\".68\n\nBIVAC asserts that such conclusions are reflected in: (i) the audit by the Contralor\u00eda General de la Rep\u00fablica conducted from October 2000 to October 2002, which concluded that the Contract was valid and that the assertions of breach were unfounded; (ii) formal recognitions of the debt by the Minister of Finance, as declared in February 2001 and in April 2004; and (iii) the investigation initiated by the Direcci\u00f3n Nacional de Aduanas in February 2005, which led to the conclusion that BIVAC had fully complied with the Contract; see Tribunal's Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, May 29, 2009, para 10.\n\nBIVAC Memorial, paras. 49-144; slides from BIVAC's opening speech during the hearing on the merits, 5 July 2011, Slides 11-49.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 55; BIVAC Memorial, paras. 58-159.\n\n62.\n\nThe Respondent objects to BIVAC's assertion that the debt was ever acknowledged, or to its characterization of the existence of the debt as \"undisputed\". It asserts that the various ministerial letters referred to by the Claimant are largely statements of fact and do not contain any legally binding expression of acknowledgment and that the different reports established by Government agencies are to be qualified as internal documents, advisory technical opinions, *dictamen*, of a non-binding character. The Respondent insists that Paraguay's legal position as to the validity and the quantum of the debt does not equal its repudiation as alleged by Claimant:69 \"Paraguay has never repudiated any of BIVAC's contractual rights\".70\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Memorial, paras. 65-77.\n\nIbid., para 24\n\n63.\n\nThe Respondent also alleges that the Tribunal did not accurately portray Paraguay's position when it held in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction that \"at no point did any authority acting on behalf of Paraguay conclude that the Contract had not been complied with or challenge the level of amounts owing under the 19 unpaid invoices\". In support of this claim it sets forth two arguments. First, the Respondent deems the acceptance or challenge of the alleged debt as a substantive matter, which was to be dealt with at the merits stage of proceedings pursuant to Procedural Order No.1. Second, the Respondent alleges it rebutted the Claimant's argument that the Respondent had never challenged the debt. The Respondent insists it devoted no fewer than three full paragraphs in its Post-Hearing Memorial on Jurisdiction to this issue, and alleges the Respondent's challenge was acknowledged by the Tribunal. Further, the Respondent alleges the Tribunal's perception of the Respondent's position in paragraphs 123 and 124 contradicts the Tribunal's own observations in paragraph 111.71\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 22-26; paras. 67-72.\n\n64.\n\nThe Respondent further submits that even if the Minister had admitted the debt, BIVAC's claims are \"unliquidated\" under Article 439 of the Paraguayan Code of Civil Procedure.72\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 27-28.\n\n65.\n\nBIVAC notes that Paraguay disputed the amount of the debt for the first time in its Counter-Memorial, almost twelve years after the termination of the Contract and more than three years after the arbitration commenced. In its Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal noted that \"Paraguay's failure to challenge the level of indebtedness may amount to an acknowledgment of such indebtedness.\"73 BIVAC further submits that the only document cited by Paraguay to support the argument that it disputed the debt is Minister Doll's telegram of 20 January 1999, and that this document does not specify the documents or debts the Minister objected to, as required under Article 4.5 of the Contract.74 Moreover, no evidence prior or subsequent to Minister Doll's telegram of 20 January 1999 validates such allegation. With regard to the argument that the claim is \"unliquidated\" BIVAC submits that this argument does not detract from the Government's acceptance of the principal amounts due: the invoices have a clear face value and the amount of the debt has been certified by the Ministry of Finance.75\n\nTribunal Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 124; BIVAC Reply, para. 26.\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Bojanovich, para. 29; Certified Telegram from the Minister of Finance to BIVAC BV, dated 20 January 1999, Exhibit CE-70.\n\nList of Outstanding Invoices prepared by the Ministry of Finance, 6 August 1999, Exhibit CE-22; BIVAC Reply, paras. 3135.\n\n***4.1.3. The Alleged Breach of the Contract by BIVAC***\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n66.\n\nThe Respondent argues that BIVAC breached material provisions of the Contract.76 First, the Respondent contends that BIVAC impermissibly inspected Mercosur Goods and charged Paraguay a fee for goods that were exempted from the inspection programme.77 BIVAC argues that not all goods originating in Mercosur countries were exempt goods and not all goods shipped from a Mercosur country necessarily qualified as originating from Mercosur, as they had to comply with applicable rules of origin. According to BIVAC, such verification as to the \"actual origin\" of the goods could not be ascertained without the documentation enclosed with the Certificate of Inspection.78 However, according to the Respondent, only few goods originating in Mercosur countries were subject to import duties in Paraguay and BIVAC had the burden of presenting evidence that the only Mercosur goods that it charged to inspect were those few goods that were subject to duties. Moreover, the Respondent argues that inspection by BIVAC of Mercosur goods was not permitted under the Treaty of Asunci\u00f3n because the responsibility to confirm the origin of such goods fell on the exporting State.79 Thus, by charging Paraguay to confirm the origin of goods already certified, BIVAC imposed fees for work that had already been done.80\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 29-42; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 10-23; and Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 7885.\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 41; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 10-17; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 83-85.\n\nBIVAC explains that Article 1 of Resolution 1579, dated 10 September 1996, Exhibit CE-53, amended the list of goods exempt from inspection, contained in Article 7 of Resolution No. 1171/96, dated 3 July 1996, Exhibit CE-51, to include \"any and all imports free and clear of duties or internal taxes, as described in general or special laws\". However, it did not establish a blanket exemption on all Mercosur-origin goods, some of which continued to bear import duties. See BIVAC Reply, para. 60.\n\nTreaty of Asunci\u00f3n, (RL-32, RL-33, RL-34).\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 10-17.\n\n67.\n\nSecond, the Respondent contends that BIVAC impermissibly charged multiple inspection fees for single inspections, by issuing multiple certificates of inspection on a single commercial invoice to create more opportunities to charge the US$ 280 minimum inspection fee. According to the Respondent, charging to inspect each part of a single shipment violated the applicable regulations, whether or not importers requested such inspections. In the Respondent's view, a \"reasonable\" reading of Ministry Resolution 117181 suggested two things: first, that partial shipments had to be batched together for custom purposes so that an importer could not evade payment by breaking orders into small, exempt shipments; and second, that although BIVAC should get paid if it was required to inspect small shipments, nothing indicated that BIVAC should be paid a minimum fee for \"each\" such partial shipment, in which case the Parties would have said so clearly.82\n\nMinistry of Finance Resolution No. 1171, dated 3 July 1996, Exhibit CE-51, Article 7, (providing that shipments with a value of less than US$3,000 were not subject to inspection) and Article 6 (providing that partial shipments with values of less than US$ 3,000 FOB that are part of a request or purchase/sale order exceeding US$3,000 FOB shall be subject to inspection).\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 39-40; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 18-23.\n\n68.\n\nBIVAC has firmly denied all charges that it manipulated the inspection programme and argues that it scrupulously followed Government regulations, as called for in its Coordination Procedure.83 BIVAC argues that it could not have issued multiple certificates of inspection when this was not called for as each certificate of inspection had to relate to a shipment under a specific request for pre-shipment inspection filed by the trader, and no more than one certificate could be issued per shipment. Thus, each inspection attracted the minimum fee payable under the Contract because the FOB value of each shipment was below the threshold value in the Contract and not because of any form of manipulation by BIVAC.84\n\nCoordination Procedure, GPSI Paraguay, dated 16 October 1996, Exhibit CE-10; and Resolution No. 1171/1996, dated 3 July 1996, Exhibit CE-51, Article 16.\n\nReply Witness Statement of Mr. Bojanovich, paras. 17-18; and BIVAC Reply, paras. 53-57; Hearing on the Merits, 5-7 July 2011, transcript, pp. 406-408.\n\n69.\n\nFinally, the Respondent argues that BIVAC failed to provide technical assistance and training to the Paraguayan customs authorities and did not assist Paraguay to create a database that would permit those authorities to eventually become self-sufficient, as required under the Contract and in accordance with the WTO technical assistance standards incorporated into the Contract.85 The Respondent also alleges that a report from the Comptroller department shows that BIVAC had not held the required training program.86 Moreover, the \"loan\" of a personal computer, printer and monitor,87 together with an invitation to a customs official to visit the Claimant's offices in Ecuador and a monthly shipment of disks containing extremely limited information did not discharge the Claimant of its technical assistance obligations under the Contract.88\n\nContract, Exhibit CE-6, Articles 2.9 and 2.10; see also Paraguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 32-34.\n\nReport from Victor Jose Safer Presentado, *Contralor General de Aduana*, dated 30 March 1999, Exhibit RE-19.\n\nLetter from BIVAC Paraguay SA to the General Customs Office and receipt, dated 14 November 1996, Exhibit CE-11.\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 35-38; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 79.\n\n70.\n\nBIVAC denies any breach of Art. 2.9 and 2.10 of the Contract. It contends that the March 1999 document to which Paraguay refers has been superseded by other more authoritative documents certifying the absence of a breach.89 Moreover, BIVAC submits that the National Customs Office has certified delivery of the computer and the data, as required under Art. 2.10 of the Contract, and that the General Comptroller of the Republic has investigated this issue and exonerated BIVAC.90 BIVAC further contends that it complied with all of its obligations under the Contract and that at no point did Paraguay notify it of any breach under the Contract, nor did it take any action for breach of the Contract against BIVAC.91\n\nReport No. 4249 of the General Comptroller of the Republic, dated 4 October 2002, Exhibit CE-30; Reply Witness Statement of Mr. Bojanovich, para. 13; BIVAC Reply, paras. 43-47.\n\nLetter from BIVAC Paraguay SA to the General Customs Office and receipt, dated 14 November 1996, Exhibit CE-11; Report No 4249 of the General Comptroller of the Republic, dated 4 October 2002, Exhibit CE-30, p. 6; Reply Witness Statement of Mr. Bojanovich, para. 13; BIVAC Reply, para. 48-51.\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para 30-48; BIVAC Reply, para. 42.\n\n***4.1.4. The Alleged \"Political Reasons\" Motivating Paraguay's Conduct***\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n71.\n\nParaguay contends that the non-payment of BIVAC's invoices, the investigations into the Contract, the commissions and reports were not politically motivated. Rather, Paraguay argues that non-payment of BIVAC's invoices was a \"fiscal issue\" and that the poor health of the Paraguayan economy had to be taken into account.92\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para 51-66; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 97-98.\n\n72.\n\nBIVAC does not dispute that the period between 1997 and 2001 was economically difficult for Paraguay, but it argues that in the absence of a defence of necessity under international law, Paraguay is not exempted from its obligation under the Contract to settle the debt.93\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 14.\n\n73.\n\nMoreover, BIVAC notes that Paraguay has not explained how the difficult fiscal situation that existed between 1997 and 2001 could excuse the non-payment of the debt after the economy began to recover in 2001.94\n\nIbid., para. 15.\n\n***4.1.5. Paraguay's Alleged Dissatisfaction with the Contract***\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n74.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Contract failed to bring a tangible economic benefit to Paraguay, noting that the costs Paraguay incurred as a result of the Programme exceeded the benefits it received in increased tax revenue.95\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 43-50.\n\n75.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Paraguay's dissatisfaction with the Contract is no defence to Paraguay's conduct and that no provision of the Contract provides that Paraguay could withhold payment on that basis. Moreover, the Claimant argues that this submission lacks merit as the Tribunal had already found this argument to be unpersuasive at the jurisdictional stage.96\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 19, referring to the Tribunal's Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction of May 29. 2009, paras. 95-96.\n\n**4.2. The Claimant's Ius Standi**\n----------------------------------\n\n***4.2.1. The Respondent's Position***\n--------------------------------------\n\n76.\n\nThe Respondent argues that the Tribunal should dismiss BIVAC's claim for lack of standing.97\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras.141-148; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 205-206.\n\n77.\n\nThe Respondent submits that Claimant has not met its burden of proof to establish its standing to bring a claim under the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT. Specifically, it argues that the Claimant has failed to establish that the contracting party is BIVAC BV, the Dutch company, rather than BIVAC International, incorporated in France.98\n\nThe Respondent refers to Article 24(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules and Art. 2(c) of ICSID Institution Rules to support its view that \"[i]t is upon Claimant to establish that Paraguay \u2018consented' to submit this dispute to ICSID, which it must do through Paraguay's consent in the BIT\" (Paraguay Counter-Memorial, para. 148.)\n\n78.\n\nTo support its argument that BIVAC International - and not BIVAC BV - is the party in interest Paraguay asserts that (i) BIVAC International signed the Contract with the Ministry of Finance;99 (ii) the Ministry invited BIVAC International to submit its qualifications;100 (iii) BIVAC International responded to the Ministry's qualification registration;101 (iv) the Ministry's working group recommended BIVAC International and SGS to the Minister of Finance;102 (v) the Ministry recommended the retention of BIVAC International to the President;103 (vi) the President passed the Decree authorizing the hiring of BIVAC International;104 (vii) BIVAC International appears on the signature page of the Contract;105 (viii) the Contract preamble makes reference to BIVAC International and SGS;106 (ix) subsequent regulation continued to show BIVAC International as the contracting party;107 (x) the Post-Termination Report prepared by the *Contralor\u00eda* invoked the lack of clarity with respect to the proper contracting party;108 (xi) French diplomats and French President Jacques Chirac himself were involved and acted on behalf of BIVAC International, while no record exists of any involvement on the part of the Dutch government or its diplomats;109 (xii) finally, a French Ministerial Memorandum described BIVAC International as the contractual party.110\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 148; Paraguay Rejoinder, para. 205.\n\nLetter of the Ministry of Finance No. 775, dated 6 December 1995, Exhibit RE-7.\n\nLetter of BIVAC International, dated 20 December 1995, Exhibit RE-8.\n\nLetter of the Ministry of Finance, dated 15 January 1996, Exhibit RE-9.\n\nLetter of the Ministry of Finance No. 104, dated 19 January 1995, Exhibit RE-43.\n\nExecution Order No. 12311, dated 31 January 1996, Exhibit CE-5.\n\nContract, Exhibit CE-6.\n\n*Ib\u00edd*.\n\nResolution No. 1171, 3 July 1996, which regulates the operationall procedure for the pre-shipment inspection of imports, Exhibit CE-51.\n\n*Controloria*'s Post-Termination Report, Exhibit RE-23, p. 9.\n\nLetter No. 1062 from the French Ambassador in Paraguay, dated 28 September 2006, Exhibit RE-35; Letter No. 376/AL from the French Ambassador in Parguay, dated 16 December 1999, Exhibit RE-22.\n\nLetter No. 1062 from the Frencg Ambassador in Paraguay, dated 28 September 2006, Exhibit RE-35.\n\n79.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the fact that BIVAC BV might have been the entity through which BIVAC International intended to perform its obligations does not mean that Paraguay granted BIVAC BV the right to perform inspection work under the Contract. Those rights, which the Tribunal has held constituted an investment in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction,111 were granted by Paraguay to BIVAC International, not BIVAC BV, as evidenced by the Decree authorizing the Contract to be concluded.112\n\nParaguay continues to disagree with the Tribunal's ruling that rights under public law granted under the Contract were an investment under the BIT. See Paraguay Rejoinder, para. 206 and footnote 282.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 206; Decree No 12311, dated 31 January 1996, Exhibit CE-5.\n\n80.\n\nThe Respondent notes that although BIVAC BV might not have been incorporated solely to take advantage of the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT, the fact that the FranceParaguay BIT did not contain an umbrella clause \"could very well explain why Claimant decided to file the arbitration demand in the name of BIVAC.\"113\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 143.\n\n81.\n\nFinally, the Respondent questions Mr. Bojanovich's explanation that BIVAC, not BIVAC International, is the affiliate in charge of government services. According to the Respondent, it is clear from the BIVAC Group's 2008 Annual Report114 that \"the parent company of both BIVAC International and BIVAC is Bureau Veritas Registre International de Classification de Navires et d'A\u00e9ronefs (\u2018Registre'), not BIVAC S.A.\" and that \"BIVAC International is the headquarters of the \u2018GSIT business', which stands for \u2018Government Services and International Trade Business'\".115 Moreover, the Respondent notes that \"BIVAC does not appear as one of Registre's principal subsidiaries\",116 nor does it appear in the comprehensive list of consolidated subsidiaries.117\n\nRegistre's 2008 Annual Report (excerpts), Exhibit RE-36, pp. 243, 245.\n\nParaguay's Counter-Memorial, para 145.\n\nParaguay's Counter-Memorial, para. 146; Registre's 2008 Annual Report (excerpts), Exhibit RE-36, p. 244.\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 146; Registre's 2008 Annual Report (excerpts), Exhibit RE-36, p. 209.\n\n***4.2.2. The Claimant's Position***\n------------------------------------\n\n82.\n\nThe Claimant argues that BIVAC BV was party to the Contract,118 as evidenced by: (i) the cover page and the first provision of the Contract which both refer to the Contract as \"between the Ministry of Finance of the Government of the Republic of Paraguay and Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC BV\";119 (ii) the first provision of the Contract which also specifies that \"Bureau Veritas, Inspection, Valuation, Assessment and Control, BIVAC B.V\" is \"a company constituted under the laws of the Netherlands\" and is referred to throughout the Contract as \"BIVAC\";120 (iii) the fact that \"BIVAC\" was represented for the purposes of the Contract by Mr. Gilles Minard and Mr. Henri Pla,121 respectively the President and Vice-President of BIVAC BV.122 According to the Claimant, the reference to \"BIVAC International\" above the signatures of Messrs Minard and Pla123 is a \"clerical error\" and the only other reference to \"BIVAC International\" in the Contract is the address where notifications under the Contract should be sent124 and this does not make \"BIVAC International\" a party to the Contract. Moreover, the Claimant notes that only BIVAC BV could conceivably be the party referred to in the Contract as Bureau Veritas Group party to the Contract, \"since it was created by to act as the company of the Group that would execute, perform and manage all pre-shipment inspection contracts signed with States\".125\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para. 281(a); BIVAC Reply, para. 157; BIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17.\n\nContract, Exhibit CE-6, Cover Page and Preamble, pp. 1-2.\n\n*Ibid*., Preamble, p. 2.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\nWitness Statement of Mr. Federico Bojanovich, para. 18.\n\nContract, Exhibit CE-6, Signatures, p. 14.\n\n*Ibid.* Signatures, Article. 10.1, p. 13.\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para. 281(a)(v). The Claimant refers to \"BIVAC BV's Articles of Association\" (statutenwijziging) registered at the Dutch Royal Notarial Regulatory Body, 17 June 1999 (with English translation), (\"Each managing director is authorized to represent the company.\") Article 10(2), Exhibit CE-49.\n\n83.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that Paraguay's commercial relationship was with BIVAC BV126 and submits the following as evidence to this effect: (i) invoices for the services provided to the Ministry of Finance under the Contract were issued by BIVAC BV;127 (ii) letters from BIVAC to the Ministry of Finance stated that payments under the Contract were to be made to a bank account held by \"Bureau Veritas BIVAC BV\"128; (iii) a security bond issued by Banco Sudameris Paraguay to the Ministry of Finance \"on behalf of the company BUREAU VERITAS, INSPECTION, VALUATION, ASSESSMENT AND CONTROL, BIVAC B.V.\" pursuant to Clause 5.4 of the Contract;129 (iv) the Decree which authorized the Ministry of Finance to communicate to \"BIVAC BV\" the intention of the Government not to extend the Contract beyond its initial term pursuant to Clause 8.2 of the Contract;130 (v) the letter from the Ministry of Finance addressed to \"BIVAC BV\" notifying the termination of the Contract;131 and (vi) the letter from the Ministry of Finance addressed to \"BIVAC Paraguay S.A.\" which refers both to \"the debt of the Ministry of Finance with the company BIVAC BV\" and to conversations held with \"Mr Henri Pla, director of BIVAC BV\".132\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para. 281(b).\n\nCopies of invoices issued by BIVAC, Exhibit CE-47.\n\nLetter from BIVAC to the Ministry of Finance, dated 29 July 1996, Exhibit CE-46.\n\nSecurity Bond issued by Banco Sudameris Paraguay to the Ministry of Finance of Paraguay, dated 4 June 1996, Exhibit CE-8.\n\nDecree No 2003, dated 19 February 1999, Exhibit CE-48.\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC B.V., dated 24 February 1999, Exhibit CE-18.\n\nLetter from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC Paraguay, dated 19 April 2004, Exhibit CE-31.\n\n84.\n\nThe Claimant argues that it is irrelevant that the initial Decree authorizing the Ministry of Finance to contract pre-shipment inspection services refers to \"BIVAC International (Bureau Veritas Group) of France\",133 as it was only a \"logical starting point for contacts\" to refer to the more visible BIVAC parent company and to the Bureau Veritas Group as a whole. It is also irrelevant, according to the Claimant, that the \"Coordination Procedure\" of BIVAC Paraguay was issued by BIVAC International, as this document was prepared for \"Bureau Veritas internal use\" and \"could not have any effect vis-\u00e0-vis the Government let alone alter in any way the fact that the Government's contractual relationship was with BIVAC BV.\"134\n\nDecree No. 12311, dated 31 January 1996, Exhibit CE-5, Article 1.\n\nFor both of these points cf. BIVAC Memorial, para. 282.\n\n85.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant maintains that it is wrong to say that the Certificates of Inspection were provided by \"BIVAC International\" and it explains the different steps through which inspections were carried out.135 First, importers would lodge a \"Request for Pre-Shipment Inspection\" form with one of BIVAC's liaison offices in Paraguay.136 These documents were then dispatched by BIVAC's central liaison office in Asunci\u00f3n to the appropriate BIVAC Centre of Relation with Exporters (CRE) in the country of export and to BIVAC's central office in Rotterdam. The CRE in the country of export would appoint an inspector who would carry out the physical inspection and submit his conclusions to the CRE.137 The CRE would then provide the exporter with a draft Certificate of Inspection (carrying the letterhead \"BIVAC International\"), which would be sent internally to BIVAC Paraguay. BIVAC Paraguay would then verify the information contained therein and provide a final Certificate of Inspection to the importers and the Paraguayan authorities.138 Thus, the Claimant contends that the company responsible for the Certificate of Inspection was BIVAC Paraguay, BIVAC BV's liaison office in Paraguay.\n\nBIVAC Memorial, paras. 37-42 and 283; and Resolution No. 1171 (which regulates the operational procedure for the preshipment inspection of imports), dated 3 July 1996, Exhibit CE-51, Article 12, (\"physical inspection\").\n\nSamples of Requests for Inspection, Exhibit CE-59 (in Spanish).\n\nResolution No. 1171, dated 3 July 1996, Exhibit CE-51, Article 12.\n\nSamples of copies of the Certificates of Inspection, Exhibit CE-62 (in Spanish).\n\n86.\n\nFinally, the Claimant notes that Dutch investors' rights to arbitrate disputes under the Treaty are not conditioned upon their government assisting in the resolution of the dispute. Thus, the fact that \"there is no record of any involvement on the part of the Dutch Government or its diplomats\", as alleged by Respondent, is irrelevant.139\n\nParaguay's Memorial on the Merits, para. 148.\n\n87.\n\nThe Claimant also notes that despite the Tribunal's invitation in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction that Paraguay provide additional evidence to establish that BIVAC lacks standing, Paraguay has provided no such additional evidence in its Counter-Memorial.140\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 155; BIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 17.\n\n88.\n\nFor all these reasons, the Claimant contends that Paraguay's *ius standi* argument should be dismissed.\n\n***4.2.3. The Tribunal's Reasoning and Decision***\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n89.\n\nIn its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Tribunal decided to join to the merits the issue of BIVAC's standing to bring the claim in order to allow both Parties the opportunity to present their arguments because it was raised at a late stage by the Respondent, some three weeks after the hearing on jurisdiction.141\n\nTribunal's Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 50-53 and 162(d).\n\n90.\n\nIn order to facilitate and orient the Parties' arguments, the Tribunal had already set out its perception of the facts and law based on the evidence available to it before the Decision was rendered. The relevant passage is set out for convenience:142\n\n\"(1) It has not been contested that the BIVAC Group operates in several countries, where it has established companies, including France and the Netherlands, and that the French company (BIVAC S.A.) is the headquarters and parent company. The Dutch affiliate of BIVAC was founded in 1984, as a B.V. On the basis of the information on the record, it fulfils the requirements of being a juridical person having the nationality of the Netherlands, within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. No evidence has been put before us to indicate that the Dutch entity was created to take advantage of a favourable Netherlands-Paraguay BIT, although this point was alluded to in the Respondent's letter of 5 December 2008. The evidence before us indicates when the Contract was concluded, Mr. Gilles Minard was the Executive Director of BIVAC B.V. (a post which apparently shared with his position as President of BIVAC International/France). It has not been contested that the Paraguayan Presidential Decree No. 12,311, which authorized the Ministry of Finance to enter into contracts with SGS and with BIVAC, refers to BIVAC International (Group Bureau Veritas) of France. It has also not been contested that the cover page of the Contract refers to BIVAC BV, that the Contract states in the opening that the Contract is concluded between the Minister of Finance and BIVAC B.V. (\"a company constituted under the laws of the Netherlands\"), and that the Contract determines that this company is \"hereinafter called \"BIVAC'\" (although it also refers in the same Article to the Presidential Decree and to \"BIVAC International (Bureau Veritas Group) of France\").\n\n(2) The parties apparently disagree on whether the Contract was signed on behalf of BIVAC International S.A. (France) or BIVAC B.V. (Netherlands). The documents are far from clear. The signatures are placed under the words \"BIVAC International\" and the postal address refers to BIVAC International, in France. On the other hand, the commercial register of Rotterdam in The Netherlands identifies one of the signatories, Mr. Gilles Minard, as executive director of BIVAC B.V. (Netherlands) and the notarial deed of 29 April 1996, established in Asunci\u00f3n and attached to the Contract, certifies a power of attorney for Mr. Henri Pla to act and sign on behalf of BIVAC B.V. (Netherlands). The authenticity of these documents has not been challenged.\n\n(3) The documentation is - to say the least - far from being entirely consistent. The documents presently before us do not allow us to determine exactly which of the two legal entities is to be identified as the party to the Contract with the Ministry of Finance. This may serve to distinguish the present situation with that which pertained in ICSID Case No. ARB/03/08 (*L.E.S.I. v Algeria*), on which Paraguay relies, where the identities of the signatories to the contract differed from that of the Claimant.\n\n(4) It follows that evidence beyond the documents is needed to determine with greater certainty the party in interest. This evidence appears to be available in the related circumstances concerning the parties in relation to and under the Contract. The evidence put before us shows that: (a) the initial security bond was issued on behalf of BIVAC B.V.; (b) BIVAC B.V. rendered the pre-shipment inspection technical services and invoiced the Ministry of Finance, which then made payments to a Bank account in the name of BIVAC B.V.; (c) the termination of the Contract was notified to BIVAC B.V.; and (d) in the course of these proceedings Paraguay did not invoke this standing issue until after the hearing on jurisdiction, even though it was previously aware of the economic links between BIVAC S.A. and BIVAC B.V. (in a letter dated 4 December 2007, for example, Paraguay rejected ICSID's proposal that a French national be President of the Tribunal because the \"Claimant is an entity established under the laws of the Netherlands but with very close ties to France by the fact that it is completely owned by the Bureau Veritas Group whose centre is in Paris\" (Tribunal's translation). These factors are evidenced by the documents before us. Both parties have acted under the Contract in a manner that demonstrates (implicitly at least) that they considered BIVAC B.V. to be the contracting party.\n\n(5) There appears to be no dispute between the parties that, unless otherwise agreed, the nationality of a legal entity is not determined by who controls it, but by its place of incorporation. Article 25(2)(b) ICSID Convention defines \"national of another Contracting State\" to mean any juridical person which has the nationality of a Contracting State other than the State party to the dispute. Case law and commentary are clear in their support for the proposition that States have a broad discretion to define corporate nationality, for instance for the purposes of a BIT. The BIT in this case does so by specifying in its Article 1(b)(ii) that \"nationals\" of either Contracting Party comprise \"legal persons constituted under the law of that Contracting Party\", which indicates that no test of corporate control is required. On the basis of the limited evidence that has been put before us so far, it appears that Paraguay's argument may prove to be difficult to sustain. The documentary material appears to show quite clearly that both parties acted on the basis that the Claimant was the contracting partner, even if two entities (the Claimant and BIVAC S.A. (France)) may have been involved in aspects of the Contract. If Paraguay decides to maintain this argument it will have to provide additional evidence to establish that BIVAC lacks standing to bring these proceedings.\"\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 53.\n\n91.\n\nThe evidence that has been presented to the Tribunal since it rendered its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction has not clarified the picture any further.\n\n92.\n\nIt is still uncontested that the BIVAC Group operates (and has established companies in) several countries, including France and the Netherlands, and that the French S.A. is the headquarters and the parent company. The fact that the French President has intervened in favour of the group does not imply that the Claimant is French, nor does the non-intervention by Dutch political authorities imply that it is not Dutch. The intervention or non-intervention indicates a difference in the political culture of different countries but does not determine the legal reality of different members within a group of companies.\n\n93.\n\nThe Dutch BIVAC was founded in 1984 as a BV and it fulfils the requirements of being a juridical person having the nationality of the Netherlands, as set out in Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. The fact it was constituted in 1984 clearly demonstrates that it was not established with the aim to profit from the favourable Dutch-Paraguayan BIT only after the dispute had arisen. At the time of the conclusion of the Contract, Mr. Gilles Minard was the executive director of BIVAC BV (a post which he held whilst simultaneously acting as President of BIVAC International). In that context the Tribunal notes the view advanced by one commentator :\n\n\"A putative investor can structure its investment through a company having the nationality of a state which has an investment treaty with the host state of the planned investment. This is an example of an investment treaty performing its stated purpose; *viz.* to attract foreign capital: There cannot, however, be a restructuring of the investment in order to resort to the dispute resolution provisions of an investment treaty once a dispute has arisen. Treaty shopping is acceptable, forum shopping is not.\"143\n\nZ. Douglas, *The International Law of Investment Claims*, Cambridge University Press, 2009, para. 542.\n\n94.\n\nThe fact that international groups of companies put in place different strategies and legal structures cannot of itself be considered to be inappropriate or even illegitimate, and cannot as such justify any suspicions of a hidden agenda as to a future litigation strategy, as alleged by Respondent144\n\nSupra, para. 77.\n\n95.\n\nThe evidence establishes that the Paraguayan Presidential Decree No. 12311 dated 31 January 1996 authorized the Ministry of Finance to enter into contracts with SGS and with BIVAC and specified BIVAC International (Group Bureau Veritas) of France. It is undisputed that the Contract mentions on its cover page BIVAC BV and states in its first Article that the Contract is concluded between the Minister of Finance and BIVAC BV \"a company constituted under the laws of the Netherlands\" and determines that this company is \"hereinafter called \u2018BIVAC'\", only to refer in the same Article to the Presidential Decree and \"BIVAC International (Bureau Veritas Group) of France\". What is disputed is whether the Contract was signed on behalf of BIVAC International or on behalf of BIVAC BV. The relevant documents are not dispositive. The signatures to the Contract appear under \"BIVAC International\" and the postal address referred to is that of BIVAC International in France. On the other hand, the Rotterdam commercial register identifies one of the signatories, Mr. Gilles Minard, as executive director of BIVAC BV and the notarial deed of 29 April 1996, established in Asunci\u00f3n and attached to the Contract, certifies a power of attorney for Mr. Henri Pla to act and sign on behalf of BIVAC BV. Neither the existence nor the legality of these documents are denied.\n\n96.\n\nAs it has been presented by the Parties, the documentation does not allow for the Tribunal to determine with any degree of certitude which of the two legal entities is to be identified as the contracting party. The Tribunal is required to go further to determine the identity of the party in interest. The Tribunal must look to the circumstances and effective conduct of both parties during the performance of the Contract. Such conduct is reflected *inter alia* in the following facts: the initial security bond was issued on behalf of BIVAC BV; BIVAC BV rendered the pre-shipment inspection technical services and invoiced the Ministry of Finance which in turn made payments to a Bank account held by BIVAC BV; the termination of the Contract was notified to BIVAC BV; in the course of the arbitral proceedings Respondent has not evoked the lack of standing in a substantiated way until after the hearing on jurisdiction although it was aware of the economic links between BIVAC International and BIVAC BV: in its letter dated 4 December 2007 with regard to the constitution of the Arbitral Tribunal, Paraguay had rejected a French national as President of the Tribunal because \"Claimant is an entity established under the laws of the Netherlands but with very close ties to France by the fact that it is completely owned by the Bureau Veritas Group whose centre is in Paris\" (Tribunal's translation).145\n\nLetter of Paraguay's Procuradur\u00eda General, dated 4 December 2007, ICSID, File of Request and Registration.\n\n97.\n\nThe facts lead the Tribunal to conclude without any difficulty that from the conclusion of the Contract until the Respondent's letter dated 5 December 2008 challenging the Claimant's standing for the first time, both parties had acted in full knowledge of the fact that two legal entities existed.146 On the Respondent's side, this knowledge was common and not reserved to one Ministry. In view of this knowledge and the parties' conduct throughout the contractual relation, as evidenced by the documentation, the Tribunal is confident to state that both BIVAC and Paraguay have - at least implicitly - considered BIVAC BV to be the contracting party.\n\nParaguay letter to the Tribunal, dated 5 December 2008.\n\n98.\n\nThese facts and arguments remove the ambiguity which emerge from the Contractual documents to such a degree as to allow the Tribunal to rule that the Claimant is the correct party in interest. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has standing to bring the claim, and there is no other bar to its doing so.\n\n**4.3. The Alleged Violation of the Clause on Fair and Equitable Treatment and its Consequences**\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n99.\n\nArticle 3(1) of the BIT reads:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.\"\n\n100.\n\nIn its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that it had jurisdiction in relation to the claim made under Article 3(1) of the BIT and that the claim was admissible. The Tribunal made a number of observations, and these are here set out for convenience:\n\n\"In these circumstances, it appears at this preliminary stage of the proceedings that there is no apparent unresolved dispute as to the amount payable. Accordingly, we conclude that it would not be premature to come to a decision on the merits of the claim under Article 3(1) of the BIT, at least in so far as the claim relates to acts attributable to Paraguay in relation to the failure to make payments owing under the Contract. In reaching this conclusion, we wish to make clear that we express no view whatsoever on the merits of the case. In particular, our finding as to jurisdiction should not be taken to reflect any view, even provisional in nature, as to whether a persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt, however unreasonable or unwarranted, could of itself ever amount to a violation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment in circumstances in which a contractually agreed remedy remains available. In this regard, we note that in *Impregilo SpA v Pakistan* (...) the tribunal made the following point in relation to the interplay between treaty claims and contract claims, of considerable pertinence also for the present case:\n\n'In order that the alleged breach of contract may constitute a violation of the BIT, it must be the result of behaviour going beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt. Only the State in the exercise of its sovereign authority ('*puissance publique*'), and not as a contracting party, may breach the obligations assumed under the BIT. In other words, the investment protection treaty only provides a remedy to the investor where the investor proves that the alleged damages were a consequence of the behaviour of the Host State acting in breach of the obligations it had assumed under the treaty.'\n\nApplying this standard, in order to succeed in a claim alleging violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT, BIVAC would have to meet a threshold for treaty claims that requires it to establish acts by or attributable to Paraguay that show an act of \u2018puissance publique', that is to say \u2018activity beyond that of an ordinary contracting party'.\n\nThe fundamental basis of the claim under Article 3(1) of the BIT, over which this Tribunal has jurisdiction, turns on the interpretation and application of that provision and alleged acts of Paraguay (as 'puissance publique'), not on the interpretation and application of the Contract as such, although the Contract will necessarily be part of the overall factual and legal matrix. Moreover, the interpretation of Article 3(1) of the BIT is not a matter over which the courts of Asunci\u00f3n would be able to exercise jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Contract. The issue of fair and equitable treatment, and related matters, was not one which the parties to the Contract agreed to refer to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Asunci\u00f3n. The treaty issue is therefore not one for that forum, and there can be no question of an independent or self-standing treaty claim over which we have jurisdiction being inadmissible by reason of the choice of forum for the resolution of a dispute under the Contract.\"147\n\nTribunal's Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, paras. 125 and 127.\n\n***4.3.1. The Claimant's Position***\n------------------------------------\n\n101.\n\nThe Claimant submits that Paraguay has breached Article 3(1) of the Treaty. It alleges that the applicable fair and equitable treatment standard is high (4.3.1.1) and that Paraguay has failed to ensure fair and equitable treatment of BIVAC's investment through arbitrariness, lack of transparency and due process, negligence and inconsistency, bad faith, repudiation of the debt and breach of legitimate expectations (4.3.1.2). It insists that Paraguay's conduct was unfair and inequitable because it was an abuse of governmental power, or '*puissance publique*' (4.3.1.3). It also asserts that Paraguay has impaired BIVAC's investment with unreasonable measures (4.3.1.4). Moreover, the Claimant disputes Paraguay's submission that BIVAC is compelled to go before Paraguayan courts (4.3.1.5). Finally, the Claimant submits that Paraguay's breach of Article 3(1) caused BIVAC's losses (4.3.1.6) and that Paraguay thus owes BIVAC full compensation (4.3.1.7).148\n\nBIVAC Memorial, paras. 160-257; BIVAC Reply, paras. 61-153; and BIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 18-138.\n\n4.3.1.1. The Treaty Standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n102.\n\nThe Claimant contends that the fair and equitable treatment (\"FET\") standard is a high and flexible standard which offers crucial protection for investors in a variety of situations in which State conduct may be regarded as unfair or inequitable in the context of investment relations.149 It notes that the \"fundamental importance\" of the FET standard is directly recognized in the Netherland-Paraguay BIT as it is even referred to in the preamble, which reads:\n\n\"[...] Recognizing that agreement upon the treatment to be accorded to such investments will stimulate the flow of capital and technology and the economic development of the Contracting Parties and that fair and equitable treatment of investment is desirable [...]\"150\n\nBIVAC Memorial, paras. 162-178; BIVAC Reply, paras. 79-86; on the issue of flexibility, the Claimant refers to the following authorities: P.

Not only does Article 3(1) not make any reference to customary international law or to the international minimum standard of treatment, but Paraguay has not cited a single award to support its interpretation.159 Contrary to Paraguay's contentions, the statement of interpretation of the NAFTA Free Trade Commission (FTC),160 which expressly ties the \"fair and equitable treatment\" standard to customary international law, does not apply to the interpretation of other BITs.161 The distinction in language between the FTC Statement and the text of Article 3(1) of the Netherlands-Paraguay BIT \"underlines the election made by the Netherlands and Paraguay to establish the fair and equitable treatment standard as an independent, self-contained treaty standard, not reducible to the minimum standard of treatment in customary international law.\"162\n\nBIVAC Reply, paras. 80-81.\n\nNAFTA Free Trade Commission, Notes of Interpretation of Certain Chapter 11 Provisions, 31 July 2001, Exhibit RL-26.\n\nThe Claimant submits that this is widely accepted: see e.g. *Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and Vivendi Universal S.A. v.

The Breach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n107.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that Paraguay's conduct, seen as a whole and not limited to the non-payment of the debt, constitutes unfair and inequitable treatment. It summarizes the facts and lists a raft of governmental actions that it asserts illustrate what it describes as a \"rocambolesque story of contradiction, arbitrary behaviour and total absence of transparency\".165 The actions relied upon by the Claimant are here set out:\n\n\u2022 \"By mid-1997 and in conjunction with the mounting criticism of the Government and an acrimonious election campaign against President Wasmosy, the Government's priorities shifted and payments under the Contract started to fall into arrears;\n\n\u2022 Without any communication to BIVAC, the new Government of President Raul Cubas that took office in August 1998 and Minister of Finance Gerhard Doll instigated a number of investigations into the manner in which the previous regime had entered into the Contract;\n\n\u2022 Payments for services under the Contract from that moment on were completely withheld;\n\n\u2022 In response to requests for payment by BIVAC, on 21 January 1999 Minister Doll objected to all of the invoices on the basis of unspecified breaches of the Contract;\n\n\u2022 In the meetings that followed, the Minister of Finance did not explain how or when BIVAC had failed to observe its obligations under the Contract;\n\n\u2022 In complete contradiction, in early March 1999, a number of invoices dating back to 1997 were paid. This was the last payment that BIVAC received;\n\n\u2022 On 19 February 1999 Presidential Decree No. 2003 was passed authorising the Ministry of Finance to discontinue the Contract upon termination of its initial term;\n\n\u2022 In June 1999, the new Minister of Finance Federico Zayas acknowledged the State's obligation to pay the debt to BIVAC;\n\n\u2022 On 6 August 1999, the Ministry of Finance compiled the list of the nineteen outstanding invoices owed to BIVAC;\n\n\u2022 Immediately after the termination of the Contract, on 14 June 1999 Minister Zayas responded to BIVAC's request for payment by proposing a discount of 50% of the pending debt;\n\n\u2022 Following meetings in July 1999 Minister Zayas put forward a different proposal: paying BIVAC's debt in Government bonds;\n\n\u2022 Despite all this, on 2 December 1999 Minister Zayas indicated that the debt could not be paid until the Contralor\u00eda completed its \u2018Special Investigation', which had started a year before and of which BIVAC had never been informed;\n\n\u2022 On 13 December 1999, Minister Zayas wrote to BIVAC raising a different ground for nonpayment: that the debt could not be paid until the National Congress passed a law authorizing payment;\n\n\u2022 The contents of the correspondence exchanged between BIVAC and the Ministry were subsequently leaked to the press;\n\n\u2022 In June 2000, the Legal Department of the Ministry of Finance concluded a review and found that there had been no proved irregularities in the Certificates of Pre-Shipment Inspection issued by BIVAC;\n\n\u2022 The Ministry of Finance nonetheless recommended that the General Customs Office conduct an audit of BIVAC's compliance with the Contract;\n\n\u2022 In September 2000, Minister Zayas stated in the press that the debt with BIVAC and SGS had been invalidly assumed by the Wasmosy Government;\n\n\u2022 On 12 February 2001, the legal department of the Ministry of Finance prepared an internal opinion for the new Minister Oviedo Br\u00edtez noting that the debt was legitimate and should be paid after the Contralor\u00eda's investigation;\n\n\u2022 The following day, new Minister Oviedo Br\u00edtez wrote to BIVAC noting that the debt was payable and the investigation would be accelerated;\n\n\u2022 Following meetings with BIVAC's representatives, Minister Oviedo Br\u00edtez agreed to make a partial payment during the 2001 fiscal year of approximately US$5.4 million, and to pay the remainder of the debt in 2002;\n\n\u2022 Shortly thereafter, the Ministry prepared to include the amount of the debt in the State budget;\n\n\u2022 In complete contradiction on 31 July 2001 Minister Oviedo Br\u00edtez announced to the press that he would not pay given that the legality of the Contract had been put in doubt by a report of the Contralor\u00eda, and added to his objection that the issue \u2018related to a contract that was entered into by former governments';\n\n\u2022 The Contralor\u00eda report had been issued on 25 July 2001, but had not been communicated to BIVAC. The report concluded that BIVAC had failed to comply with several provisions of the Contract;\n\n\u2022 Only upon request by BIVAC, the Ministry sent the \u2018final' report of the Contralor\u00eda dated July 2001, together with two other reports of which BIVAC had no knowledge: a \u2018final' report dated February 1999, followed by another report in 2000;\n\n\u2022 All three reports concluded for different, contradictory and extremely formalistic reasons that the Contract was somehow invalid or that BIVAC had not complied with its terms;\n\n\u2022 On 17 August 2001, the legal department of the Ministry of Finance reported to the Minister of Finance noting the contradictions between the Contralor\u00eda's reports and the upholding the validity of the Contract;\n\n\u2022 In spite of the response to the reports provided by BIVAC, and the legal department's opinion, shortly afterwards BIVAC became aware that, far from being brought to a close, the investigations into the validity and performance of the Contract were being escalated to the criminal courts;\n\n\u2022 In May 2002, newly appointed Minister Spalding decided to reopen the investigations of the Contralor\u00eda;\n\n\u2022 While the Contralor\u00eda's investigations were starting afresh, BIVAC became aware that parallel investigations were being carried out by the General Customs Office, which were commenced four years earlier;\n\n\u2022 In June 2002, the General Customs Office issued a certificate confirming that it had received no complaints regarding the performance of the Contract;\n\n\u2022 In July 2002, the General Customs Office issued Resolution 113 definitively ending its investigations;\n\n\u2022 On 4 October 2002, the Contralor\u00eda issued its \u2018final' report (third final report, considering the previous two final reports of February 1999 and July 2001), fully vindicating BIVAC's position. In spite of this no payment occurred ;\n\n\u2022 On 27 November 2002, the Minister wrote to BIVAC confirming that a working group would soon be formed with the Ministry of Finance \u2018to jointly study the best course of action to be followed in order to respond to your company's claim';\n\n\u2022 In December 2002, the Public Prosecutor concluded that the criminal complaint that was pending against BIVAC's representatives was baseless;\n\n\u2022 On 30 December 2002, a Criminal Court Judge endorsed the findings of the Public Prosecutor and rejected the complaint against BIVAC's representatives;\n\n\u2022 In plain contradiction with all this, in January 2003 the newly appointed Minister Alcides Jim\u00e9nez opened yet another new investigation into the Contract;\n\n\u2022 On 28 January 2003 a two page report of the Ministry concluded that the contracts had \u2018notoriously prejudiced the State' and that the auditors had come to a \u2018negative opinion as to the implementation of the [inspection] system'. Minister Alcides Jim\u00e9nez did nothing else during his tenure;\n\n\u2022 In August 2003, the newly elected President Duarte Frutos appointed a new Minister of Finance, Dionisio Borda. Two months later, on 1 October 2003, BIVAC discovered that Minister Borda was questioning in the press the legitimacy of the debt to BIVAC;\n\n\u2022 In plain contradiction, when BIVAC's representatives met with the Vice-Minister of Finance Miguel G\u00f3mez on 8 October 2003, they were reassured that the new administration would honour the Paraguayan State's pending obligations to BIVAC;\n\n\u2022 In subsequent meetings with BIVAC's representatives in November 2003, the ViceMinister confirmed that the Ministry was considering the modalities for the payment of the debt;\n\n\u2022 Following some meetings in March 2004, on 19 April 2004 the Vice-Minister of Finance wrote to BIVAC that the Ministry wished to \u2018honour debts owed by the Paraguayan State to its various creditors, which include [BIVAC]' and that a study was being finalised in order to establish a schedule of payments;\n\n\u2022 In direct contradiction the Ministry of Finance issued Resolution No. 274 in June 2004, opening yet a new investigation into the Contract noting that the Ministry had \u2018not yet determined whether BIVAC and SGS had complied with the contract', and establishing a \u2018Commission for the Review and Negotiation of the Debt with the Companies BIVAC and SGS';\n\n\u2022 No report was issued by the Commission by the deadline of 3 September 2004;\n\n\u2022 On 25 February 2005, the Commission that had been created by Resolution No. 274 concluded that it had no competence to decide on the matter;\n\n\u2022 On 3 February 2005, the Ministry of Finance issued Resolution No. 43, cancelling Resolution No. 274 and designating the National Customs Office as the body in charge of establishing \u2018whether or not the payment of the debt for the contracted inspection services with the companies BIVAC and SGS is in order';\n\n\u2022 The National Customs Office rendered its conclusions on 30 March 2005, stating that BIVAC's performance of the Contract had been investigated several times and concluded that BIVAC had fully complied with the Contract, and that there was therefore nothing else to investigate, saying emphatically that \u2018what we are attempting to investigate is a matter that has already been decided';\n\n\u2022 However, the Minister of Finance did not inform BIVAC that the investigation had been concluded, nor did it provide BIVAC with a copy of the conclusions of the National Customs Office, despite its request following reports of the conclusions in the press. Paraguay persisted in its failure to pay;\n\n\u2022 In May 2005, incredibly Minister Borda issued a press release stating that it had launched a new investigation into the pending debt with BIVAC. Minister Bergen replaced Borda at the end of that month;\n\n\u2022 Between August and November of 2005 officials within the Ministry of Finance explained on various occasions, including to the press, that the new team within the Ministry of Finance had only recently been formed and that it would need to understand and analyse the complex issue of the payment of the debt to BIVAC;\n\n\u2022 Press reports announced that the funds necessary to pay the debt to BIVAC had been provided for in the State budget and some meetings to discuss the payment of the debt took place in April 2006;\n\n\u2022 However, in his trip to France in May 2006 President Duarte declared to the press that the Government would not \u2018pay any debt which [was] not clear', and that BIVAC's case would be submitted to yet further review by the Contralor\u00eda and the Paraguayan Congress;\n\n\u2022 By Decree 10485 of 22 June 2007, and as if nothing had happened in over eight years, President Duarte Frutos ordered yet another review of the Contract and the pending debt.\"166\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para 188.\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para 187; see also BIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 29-55; Slides from BIVAC's Opening Speech during the hearing on the merits, 5 July 2011, Slides 11-49.\n\n108.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Paraguay does not deny these actions and has not submitted a single document in support of its conduct. According to the Claimant, \"[n]othing in the evidence justifies the government's non-payment for a decade, much less nonpayment accompanied by the egregious conduct Paraguayan officials visited upon BIVAC. Rather, the documents prove the unfair and inequitable conduct\" of Paraguay:167\n\n\u2022 Paraguay refers to '*the first internal studies and reports commissioned to evaluate the situation of the unpaid invoices date back from early 1997, not 1998'* - but cites to the report of the Director General of the National Customs Office,168 which states that the Contract was '*absolutely valid*' and that the reason for non-payment was that the Ministry of Finance did not provide for the Contract in the budget as it should have.\n\n\u2022 Paraguay refers to '*payments under the Contract started to be withheld as early as 1996'* -but cites to BIVAC's letter of March 1997 to Minister Maidana,169 which records the agreement of Minister Maidana to pay the outstanding invoices for November and December 1996 along with US$1.8 million (for the invoices for January through June 1997) by 1 July 1997. Minister Maidana, however, did not make the agreed payments.\n\n\u2022 Paraguay states that it \u2018*reiterated in meetings and in correspondence its concerns about compliance*' - but cites to the March 2005 Report from the National Customs Office (which, \u2018based on the documentation,' unequivocally states that the Contract was binding and BIVAC's performance valid) and Minister Doll's January 1999 telegram (which was more concerned with delay than BIVAC's performance).170\n\n\u2022 Paraguay asserts that \u2018*Minister Zayas did not acknowledge the debt*' - but cites to Minister Doll's January telegram, which cannot speak for Minister Zayas, who took office in March 1999, and who, in June 1999, acknowledged: \u2018as of this date, the obligations of both parties arising under the Contract shall cease, except for the rights already acquired.'171\n\n\u2022 Paraguay states '*The June 2000 Report does not clear BIVAC of misconduct*' - but, having cited the June 2000 report of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Finance,172 Paraguay in the very next sentence admits that this document is the '*decision by Ministerio dismissing claims [...] concerning BIVAC s certificates.*' As noted in the bullet point below, the Legal Department exonerated BIVAC of wrongdoing.\n\n\u2022 Paraguay contends '1*2 February 2001 report does not conclude that the debt was payable*' - but in that report the Legal Department of the Ministry of Finance '*emphasized that the Paraguayan State has never denied the validity of the contract, since the contract has been performed by both parties. That is, the contracted services were rendered and the payments were made [\u2026] the validity and existence of the contract is not put in doubt because it has been complied with in a normal manner as it were, by both parties.*'173\n\n\u2022 Paraguay states '*The 13 February 2001 letter by Minister Oviedo Br\u00edtez did not acknowledge that the debt was legitimate and payable*' - but in that letter to BIVAC Minister Br\u00edtez undertook to '*proceed with utmost haste to obtain the necessary budgetary amendment from Congress to finance and pay the debt owed by the State for the rendered services.*'174\n\n\u2022 Paraguay states '*The 30 March 2005 report [\u2026] does not clear BIVAC of wrongdoing. It merely incorporated other reports [...] which did find BIVAC in material breach of certain* *contractual provisions'* - but cites to the National Customs Office Report already discussed above, which is based on \u2018*the documentation to which we have access*' and accords with the rest of the evidence emanating from Paraguay's Contralor\u00eda, Ministry, and other agencies and high officials - that \u2018*all of the contract's clauses were complied* *with.'*175\n\nBIVAC Reply, paras. 98-100 [citations are from the original document but are renumbered for purpose of this Decision].\n\nAduanas Report Concerning Contracts with SGS and Bureau Veritas, undated, Exhibit RE-16, page 4, section 5 *in fine*.\n\nLetter from Carlos Salazar and Roberto Markus, 31 March 1997, Exhibit RE-15.

The Claimant also argues that the fair and equitable treatment standard prohibits the repudiation of the debt (4.3.1.2.5) and that Paraguay has breached its legitimate expectations (4.3.1.2.6).176\n\nBIVAC Memorial, paras. 179-227; BIVAC Reply, paras. 87-124; BIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 65-81.\n\n*4.3.1.2.1. Arbitrariness*\n--------------------------\n\n110.\n\nThe Claimant submits that international tribunals have defined arbitrary conduct as \"a willful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety\"177; a measure \"not founded on reason or fact [\u2026] but on mere fear reflecting national preference\"178; the lack of explanation of alleged failures to comply with contractual obligations179; \"[d]ecisions that were taken without objective grounds, in a unilateral or arbitrary manner\"180; or insufficiencies that would be recognized \"by any reasonable and impartial man\".181\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para. 190; BIVAC Reply, para. 101\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para. 191.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 193.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 195.\n\n111.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Paraguay's conduct was arbitrary, capricious and unrestrained. The commissioning of endless reports on the same issue and the decision not to pay a recognized debt was \"without cause based on law\" and was not based on any genuine belief of possible wrongdoing by BIVAC. The Claimant explains:\n\n\"This case law all supports BIVAC. Here Paraguay in an impressive succession of contradictory acts and omissions over ten years has failed to pay to BIVAC for political reasons, linked to the general distrust by Governments and Ministers of the acts of their predecessors. Paraguay never communicated what it was doing to BIVAC. It never explained the real motivation for the non-payment. This in itself constitutes arbitrary conduct. Further, it is clear that decisions were not taken on objective or reasonable grounds, nor on the basis of a real disagreement with BIVAC over contract performance or the obligation to pay.\n\n[...]\n\nParaguay's refusal to comply with its obligations towards BIVAC's investment is demonstrably without any objective grounds. After lengthy and repetitive administrative processes, various administrative agencies and organs of the Paraguayan state have all concluded that Paraguay should honour the Contract and pay the debt. But the Executive power has not complied with these decisions. Following the holding in RFCC above, Paraguay has acted unilaterally and arbitrarily and without any justification. [...] Further, there is no contractual disagreement between the parties here, either factual or legal; nor is there a normal contractual dispute between BIVAC and Paraguay. What there is here is a completely unjustified and willful disregard by Paraguay of its obligations after engaging in an attempt to escape its obligations by setting in motion its own administrative structure.\"182\n\nBIVAC Memorial, paras. 196-197\n\n112.\n\nThe Claimant further refutes the reasons put forward by Paraguay to justify its conduct.183 First, the Claimant argues that Paraguay is wrong in saying that the \"commissions and reports were only internal reports that did not impair BIVAC's rights in any way\". According to the Claimant, \"the spurious commissions and reports are part of the arbitrary conduct because they caused deliberate delay and their repetition and reiteration betray a lack of due process and lack of regard for juridical propriety.\" Second, Paraguay's assertion that \"BIVAC ignores the economic reality of the Contract, which cost Paraguay more than it was able to recover in taxes\" is also wrong because \"the assertion that a contracting party may ignore its contractual obligations because it later considers them a bad bargain is contrary to the most elemental principles of law and justice\" and \"is per se arbitrary.\" Third, contrary to Paraguay's view that \"BIVAC ignores the undisputed evidence that BIVAC did not comply with its contractual obligations\", the Claimant contends that \"there is no evidence that BIVAC fell short of its contractual obligations\" and that \"[i]n fact, the evidence demonstrates the opposite\". Finally, the Claimant argues that it is wrong to allege that \"BIVAC's arbitrariness claim is immaterial insofar as no one ever stopped BIVAC from pursuing its rights before the courts of Asunci\u00f3n\". According to the Claimant, \"any role for the courts of Asunci\u00f3n is immaterial to BIVAC's claim.\"184\n\nParaguay's Memorial on the Merits, para. 126; and BIVAC Reply, paras. 102-106.\n\nBIVAC Reply, paras. 104-106, 36-60 and 129-138.\n\n*4.3.1.2.2. Lack of Transparency and Due Process*\n-------------------------------------------------\n\n113.\n\nThe Claimant submits that lack of transparency occurs when \"arguments [are] made to justify delay in paying compensation without basis in the Contract or Decree\"185, or when the Government fails \"to allow [the claimant] to understand exactly what the Government's preconditions for an acceptable solution were,\" or when it \"fail[s] to respond in any constructive way\" and generally acts inconsistently \"instead of engaging in meaningful negotiations.\"186\n\n*Siemens A.G. v.

The Czech Republic*, paras. 420, 423 and 430; BIVAC Memorial, para. 206; BIVAC Reply, para. 110.\n\n114.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the conduct of the Paraguayan Government with regards to the BIVAC debt is a model of lack of transparency and due process:\n\n\"While several Ministers of Finance assured BIVAC time and again that the debt would be paid, thus acknowledging the obligation to pay and the legitimacy of the debt, behind the scenes reports, reviews, investigations, enquiries, and the like were being commissioned to do exactly the opposite. BIVAC was never informed of the commencement of these processes, let alone their evolution and outcomes. Most of the time BIVAC learned about them through the press. BIVAC was never requested to participate.\n\nSimilar to the Saluka case, Paraguay did not allow BIVAC to understand the Government's position and the allegations and suspicions leveled at the Contract and the debt. Following Tecmed, Paraguay's lack of transparency suggests that the real discreditable reason for the Government's conduct was not to take responsibility for the debt and the self-interested political reasons of each Minister and Government. These are clear deficiencies that conflict with what a reasonable and unbiased observer would consider fair and equitable.\"187\n\nBIVAC Memorial, paras. 208-209; BIVAC Reply, para, 110.\n\n115.\n\nThe Claimant further notes that Paraguay has not provided any official reason for its default on the debt except for the arguments provided for the first time in its Counter-Memorial.188\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 110.\n\n*4.3.1.2.3. Negligence and Inconsistency*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n116.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the facts in the present case are very similar to those in *Kardassopoulos,*189 where the Tribunal found that the State had breached the fair and equitable treatment standard through its repeated inconsistencies in the manner it had addressed the investor's claim for payment. The Claimant explains:\n\n\"Those inconsistencies were manifest in the following facts: the \u2018 *circular response'* to the investor and its claim; the changing government attitudes towards resolving the issue; the '*lengthy delays, refusals by various government officials to address the matter'* ; the '*internal disputes over who carried responsibility for the matter'* ; '*responsibility for [the investor's] claim was shuffled from one government ministry to another, without any progress'* ; that when '*a new government was elected [\u2026] yet another State commission established to consider the matter of [the investor's] claims'* ; all the while '*the evidence discloses that senior members of the Georgian Government believed that [\u2026] compensation was owed to [the investor]*.'\"190\n\nOn the basis of other arbitral awards,191 the Claimant further submits that there has been \"evident negligence on the part of the administration in the handling\" of the debt issue; a \"roller coaster\" of unimagined proportions;192 that the varying, sometimes \"even contradictory positions\" by the government \"made it difficult or even impossible for [the Claimant] to accommodate their proposals to the Government's position\";193 that there was a \"lack of orderly process and timely disposition in relation to an investor of a Party acting in the expectation that it would be treated fairly and justly\";194 and that the Government's actions were incoherent and lacked forthrightness.195\n\n*Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v.

Bad Faith*\n----------------------\n\n117.\n\nThe The Claimant argues that in addition to the Respondent's arbitrariness, lack of transparency, negligence, inconsistency and repudiation of the debt, \"Paraguay's use of its governmental machinery to orchestrate repeated and baseless investigations into the Contract and the debt\"196 amounts to bad faith and thus to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard.197 According to the Claimant, tribunals have recognized that bad faith is a sufficient - but not a necessary - requirement for a breach of the fair and equitable standard.198 The Claimant recognizes that the legal threshold for proving bad faith under international law may be high, but in the Claimant's view, there is no doubt that Paraguay's conduct crossed that bar.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 78.\n\nBIVAC Memorial, paras. 219-227; BIVAC Reply, paras. 114-116.\n\nThe Claimant refers to *TECMED v.

Czech Republic* ].\n\n118.\n\nThe Claimant describes the facts evidencing bad faith and abuse of authority as follows:\n\n\"Absent any basis to deny payment (in spite of numerous attempts to do so), Paraguay's attempt to create difficulties for paying the debt, by using its administrative agencies and review powers smacks of bad faith. None of the instances of investigations into the Contract and the debt, all of which were favourable to BIVAC, led to the logical result: payment. Hence those review exercises were not carried out in good faith, to ascertain whether payment was due. Had there been good faith, there would not have been necessary to repeat the reviews continuously - one would have been sufficient. Once again those reviews had other more obscure and discreditable motivations, based on real or perceived political necessity. Thus Paraguay acted in bad faith and in abuse of its sovereign authority in ordering various governmental authorities *ad nauseam*, when the State had already concluded that the debt was due.\"199\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para. 227.\n\n119.\n\nThe Claimant further contends that Paraguay's defense that it has not acted in bad faith because it \"has disputed the debt\" is unsupported by the evidence, which clearly shows that Paraguay has never disputed the debt.200\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 115.\n\n*4.3.1.2.5. The Alleged Repudiation of the Debt*\n------------------------------------------------\n\n120.\n\nThe Claimant contends that Paraguay's arbitrary and inconsistent conduct can only be interpreted as a repudiation of the debt by Paraguay.201 Following the tribunal's language in *Eureko*,202 the Respondent argues that there was a \"clear decision\" by Paraguay \"to refuse to abide by and respect its legal obligations\" under the Contract, thus \"frustrat[ing] the investment\" for which Paraguay is responsible under the Treaty. According to the Claimant, Paraguay chose to avoid responsibility for the debt due to \"self-interested political motivations of each successive Minister and government\".203\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 117-121.\n\n*Eureko BV v. Republic of Poland* (*ad hoc*), Partial Award, 19 August 2005, para. 226 [hereinafter, *Eureko v.

The Claimant adds:\n\n\"The assertion that BIVAC should have \u2018known better' in contracting with Paraguay cynically seeks to allocate to investors the risk that successive governments in Paraguay would repudiate their predecessor's lawfully contracted pecuniary obligations. There is no such \u2018political volatility' exception to international obligations.\n\nParaguay cannot be heard to excuse its repudiatory conduct because it is an unreliable State, incapable of keeping its promises. But by voicing these excuses, Paraguay is unequivocally illustrating that this case is not one of pure contractual breach, but rather primarily concerns politically motivated treatment of BIVAC that is far from fair or equitable.\"205\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 119; Paraguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 93-94 and 178.\n\nBIVAC Reply, paras. 120-121.\n\n*4.3.1.2.6. Frustration of Legitimate Expectations*\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n122.\n\nAccording to the Claimant it \"had a right under the FET standard and the principle of good faith that its investment would be treated in accordance with its legitimate expectations\" and that these expectations have been violated, amounting to a breach of Paraguay's obligation of fair and equitable treatment under Article 3(1) of the Treaty.\"206 According to the Claimant, Paraguay misstates that BIVAC's sole legitimate expectation is that of payment. Adopting the approach of the tribunal in *Kardassopoulos*, the Claimant argues that the Treaty protects BIVAC's expectation of consistent, transparent, reasonable, non-arbitrary and good faith treatment from Paraguay. As stated in *Kardassopoulos*,207 the FET treatment protection includes:\n\n\"[T]he legitimate expectation that [the State] would conduct itself vis-\u00e0-vis this investment in a manner that was reasonably justifiable and did not manifestly violate basic requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and nondiscrimination. This includes, in the view of the Tribunal, implementing a compensation process [...] that is both procedurally and substantively fair.\"\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 79; BIVAC Reply, paras. 122-124.\n\n*Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v.

Ukraine (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/16), Award, 8 November 2010, para. 422 [hereinafter Alpha v. Ukraine]; BIVAC Reply, para. 123.\n\n4.3.1.3. The Alleged Governmental (Non-Commercial) Conduct and its Abuse\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n123.\n\nThe Claimant argues that its claim is based on Paraguay's \"politically motivated\"208 violation of its obligation to ensure FET treatment by using its \"sovereign prerogatives and authority to evade its obligation to pay the debt\".209 According to the Claimant, its claim is not based on a \"simple breach of Contract\",210 nor on Paraguay's commercial conduct and not even on \"a formal attempt to nullify or set aside a contract debt\",211 as these \"are purely contractual matters\" and do not qualify as breaches of the Treaty.212 The Claimant asks whether \"the persistent refusal to pay in good faith, because the tribunal said you have good reasons not to, is that a breach of the treaty? And the answer, of course, is no [...]\":213\n\n\"The key distinction at the heart of this case lies in determining whether the parties to a State contract are engaged in a genuine difference of opinion in respect of the scope or interpretation of their respective contractual rights. If so, then it is a mere contractual dispute that should be resolved by the contractual dispute resolution mechanism.\n\n[...]\n\nThis situation is to be contrasted with the situation where the conduct surrounding the contract breach is politically motivated, i.e., conduct involving the exercise of '*puissance publique*',without the existence of any genuine good faith dispute under the underlying contract. Where the State's breach of contract is the consequence of the political convenience of the government in power then it ceases to be a mere contractual breach and constitutes a parallel breach of the FET standard.\"214\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para. 235.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 233.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 235.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 203.\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 71.\n\nHearing on the Merits, 5-7 July 2011, Transcript, p. 208.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 9-10.\n\n124.\n\nThis juxtaposition implies that the \"failure to perform a contract may amount to a violation of the FET standard.\"215 A State act can be based in contract, and yet constitute a breach of a BIT if the State has not complied with its obligation to treat the investment fairly and equitably.216 Thus, breaches of the FET treatment standard can be established when the breach of contract is accompanied by the existence of \"aggravating factors\", such as government conduct which is \"arbitrary, unfair, unjust, lack[s] due process and [does] not respect the investor's reasonable and legitimate expectations.\"217 The Claimant argues that \"no distinction exists in the law of State Responsibility between acts *iure imperii* (or sovereign acts), for which States can in principle be responsible under international law, and acts *iure gestionis* (or commercial acts), for which States cannot be responsible.\"218 A State is responsible for all the acts of its associated bodies, whatever their nature.219 Even if an underlying relationship is commercial, a government's act in relation to the investor may still be governmental.220 Thus, according to the Claimant, the sole issue is \"not the character of a State's acts but whether, considering all of the circumstances of the case, the acts, howsoever characterized, violate that State's treaty obligations.\"221 Thus \"the tribunal needs to examine whether the conduct complained of breaches the FET standard\" which is independent from the breach of contract.222 It expresses its conviction that different \"Governments have escalated the unpaid debt into a political issue\"223 and that Paraguay's conduct largely transcends the limits of a good faith commercial relationship and must be qualified as an abusive exercise of governmental power.\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para. 180.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 245-246.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 245 and 181-182; the Claimant cites, e.g., the case of *Rumeli Telekom A.S. and Telsim Mobil Telekomikasyon Hizmetleri A.S. v.

BIVAC's functions directly replaced services typically performed by the Government through its customs authorities. Further, the very conclusion of the Contract responded to a political imperative to increase tax revenues from import operations in order to \"*achieve the income levels and to pay expenses provided for in the National General Budget.\"*\n\nParaguay admitted the public administrative law nature of the Contract early in these proceedings and has only recently sought to change its position. It is worth citing what Paraguay said in this respect in its first written submissions on jurisdiction:\n\n'At issue in this litigation is a Contract in which one of the parties is the State. It is not a Private Law contract, executed by two private persons. [...] Evidence of this is that the Paraguayan State has rescinded the Contract of Public Law, by means of a unilateral decision, due to the fact that the public interest was at stake, following the principle that Public Contracts may be modified or rescinded by unilateral decision of the State's Administration.' (Paraguay's Objections on Jurisdiction, 8 April 2008, page 19).\"224\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19.\n\n126.\n\nThe Claimant further submits that the dispute was political and stresses that:\n\n\"Paraguay's repudiatory conduct was due solely to political imperatives. It had nothing to do with any genuine discussion of the scope or interpretation of the Contract, or even with any concern regarding BIVAC's performance or compliance. The reality is that no Government or Minister was ready to take political responsibility for the obligations contracted by a prior administration. The endless successive investigations providing inconsistent responses simply ensured that the payment of the debt would be passed to the next Minister or Government.\"225\n\n*Ibid*, para. 22.\n\n127.\n\nThe Claimant argues that Paraguay's conduct is in breach of the FET standard and the obligation not to impair investments by unreasonable measures for a number of reasons, all of which are linked to the treatment surrounding the breach of Contract by the Government of Paraguay, rather than the breach of Contract itself:\n\n\"Once again it is not a simple breach of Contract by itself that is complained of by BIVAC; it is the manner in which Paraguay has treated BIVAC in dealing with that issue. Like in Azurix, the problem is that the issue was politicized because of popularity concerns of the different Governments, and/or because the Contract had been awarded by a previous Government. That conduct reveals politically motivated governmental arbitrariness, negligence, lack of transparency, inconsistency or bad faith, and is thus in breach of the FET standard. It is ultimately an instance of repudiation, since there cannot be any good faith explanation to Paraguay's failure to pay. We are here well within the realm of unfair and inequitable treatment [\u2026]\".226\n\nThe Claimant insists that:\n\n\"Paraguay's acts have nothing to do with the acts that an ordinary party could carry out. They are of a fundamentally different nature. In the absence of any argument to refuse payment, an ordinary contracting party would have no right to commission reports and reviews from various state agencies in order to avoid payment.\"227\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para. 235.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 238.\n\n128.\n\nThe Claimant relies on recent awards to support its position. It refers *inter alia* to the award in *Ioannis Kardassopoulos and Ron Fuchs v. Georgia* where the Tribunal held that the facts in that case did\n\n\"not preclude Mr. Fuchs from holding throughout the term of his investment the legitimate expectation that Georgia would conduct itself vis-\u00e0-vis his investment in a manner that was reasonably justifiable and did not manifestly violate basic requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination. [...]\n\nThe compensation process appears to have initially begun in the spirit of reaching an amicable settlement consistent with what Mr. Fuchs may reasonably have expected [...]. Lamentably, despite this initial instruction, the spirit of settlement appears to have diminished over time as lengthy delays, refusals by various government officials to address the matter, and internal disputes over who carried responsibility for the matter combined to result in an overall obfuscation of the compensation process and disregard for the duty to provide compensation. [\u2026]\n\nThe process which ultimately unfolded following constitution of the compensation commission in 1997 can only be described as non-transparent, arbitrary and unfair. [...] Georgia was, however, obligated to act reasonably, transparently and in a non-arbitrary manner towards the Claimants. The evidence on the record demonstrates that this is not, in fact, what transpired. There is moreover no defence, on the evidence presented, for the delay with which the process was carried out, even allowing for some delay on the part of the Claimants in submitting documentation of their claims. [...]While the Claimants complied with each request in an effort to settle the matter of their investment amicably, arranging for the preparation of two audit reports by reputable accounting firms, their efforts were consistently met with a circular response in which a resolution of the matter was ordered from the highest level of the Georgian Government only to be avoided or passed off by the individuals tasked with effecting such a resolution.\n\nOver the course of a seven year period following the formal establishment of a compensation process, responsibility for Tramex's claim was shuffled from one government ministry to another, without any progress. [...]\n\nThe Tribunal finds inexcusable the categorical denial of any responsibility or obligation towards the Claimants, which came eight years after Georgia initiated the compensation process.\"228\n\n*Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v. Georgia*, paras. 441, 443 and 446-449.\n\n129.\n\nThe Claimant submits that the facts and circumstances of *Kardassopoulos* mirror those in the case at hand. It notes that\n\n\"[h]ere too there has been a '*circular response*' to BIVAC and its claim; there have been '*lengthy delays, refusals by various government officials to address the matter*'; the '*internal disputes over who carried responsibility for the matter combined to result in an overall obfuscation of the compensation process and disregard for the duty to provide compensation*'; '*responsibility for [the investor's] claim was shuffled from one government ministry to another, without any progress*'; when '*a new government was elected [\u2026] yet another State commission established to consider the matter of [the investor's] claims*'; all while '*the evidence discloses that senior members of the [\u2026] Government believed that [\u2026] compensation was owed to*' the investor. Paraguay's conduct exhibits all these deficiencies, which constitute unfair and inequitable treatment, just as in Georgia's case.\"229\n\nThe Claimant further argues that contrary to Paraguay's view, the awards in *Bayindir*,230*RFCC*,231*Impregilo*,232*Paushok*,233*Waste Management*234 and *Parkerings*235 lend no support to Paraguay's position. According to the Claimant, those cases must be distinguished from the circumstances of the present case because they all concerned purely contractual disagreements regarding the interpretation of contract terms or \"genuine commercial divergence\"236 and there was no arbitrary and unfair conduct or other issues beyond the application of the contract.237\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 74 and BIVAC Post-Hearing Bried, paras. 56-64; the Claimant also relies on *Alpha v.

Second, according to the Claimant an \"economic crisis\" does not justify \"investigations\" into \"conduct on the part of BIVAC\" (or anything specifically to do with the Contract).

The Alleged Insufficiency of the Paraguayan Court System*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n138.\n\nAt a late stage in the proceedings, the Claimant introduced a further argumemt, namely that its own serious and legitimate concerns with the Paraguayan court system were one of the reasons why it took the \"commercial decision\" to bring the present dispute to arbitration.253 It refers to the lack of independence, corruption, delays in the rendering of judgments, high and irrecoverable costs as well as the non-enforceability of judgments.254\n\nHearing on the Merits, 5-7 July 2011, Transcript, p. 91.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 115-129; BIVAC Memorial, para. 251; BIVAC Reply, paras. 129 and 138.\n\n139.\n\nThe Claimant quotes Transparency International's 2007 and 2008 Global Corruption Reports which highlight the constant political interference in the judiciary in Paraguay and the general lack of trust due to nepotism and corruption.255 It also cites the United States Agency for International Development which concluded in its 2004 Report that there is a \"general consensus\" that Paraguay's court system was corrupt.256 The Claimant also referred to Human Rights Report for Paraguay for 2011 of the US State Department which found that\n\n\"[t]he constitution provides for an independent judiciary; in practice, however, political interference seriously compromised that independence\".257\n\nTransparency International, Global Corruption Report 2007, \"Politics and nepotism plague Paraguay's courts\", 2007, Exhibits CE-135 and CE-137, pp. 257-258 and Transparency International, Global Corruption Report 2008, \"Politics and nepotism plague Paraguay's courts\", 2008, pp. 174-176.

The Claimant contended that this statement was not contested by the Respondent,259 and that any potential judgment finding against the State would not be enforceable because in accordance with Articles 530 and 716 of the Paraguayan Civil Procedure Code the judgment can only be communicated to the Ministry of Finance so that payment is foreseen in the annual State budget.260\n\nTable of Costs of Paraguayan Court Proceedings, Exhibit CE-161(Annex 2 to BIVAC Post - Hearing Brief); BIVAC PostHearing Brief, para. 123; BIVAC Reply, para. 129.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 124.\n\n*Ibid*, paras. 125-128.\n\n141.\n\nThe Claimant alleges that there have been clear changes in the Paraguayan court system between 1996, when the Contract was signed, and 2006, when it initiated the arbitration.261 The following dialogue during the hearing is instructive:\n\n\"MR. FORTIER: Okay. Now, you took us through the chronology of the factual matrix which brought about decisions by the claimant, and you reminded us that the contract was signed, in 1996, with the clause 4 and 9.1.\n\nYou situated us in 2002 when the Comptroller's report was issued, that, in effect, said:\n\n\u2018Valid contract, BIVAC has performed its obligations under the contract. And any criticism is unfounded,' I think was the word which you focused on at one point earlier this morning.\n\nThis was in 2002. And then between 2002 and the time in 2006 when you elected to file a request for arbitration before ICSID, you reminded us of the crescendo of statements by the new president, who came into office in, I think, in August of 2003.\n\nMR. BLACKABY: Correct.\n\nMR. FORTIER: And you described --with a number of exhibits, you described what you represent demonstrates the lack of impartiality of the judiciary under the reign of President \u2018Duartos.'\n\nMR. BLACKABY: President Frutos.\n\nMR. FORTIER: [...] I understood you to say you have to focus on the lack of independence of the judiciary and the corruption prevalent in Paraguay as of the point in time when BIVAC took the decision to exercise its rights under the treaty. Correct?\n\nMR. BLACKABY: Yes, I mean, we are trying to explain the decision.\n\nMR. FORTIER: But it was the snapshot is the situation of the judiciary, its lack of independence, as of the time that you took that decision.\n\nMR. BLACKABY: Correct.\n\nMR. FORTIER: Do we have evidence in the record as to what the situation was when the contract was signed in 1996 as to the independence or lack thereof of the judiciary in Paraguay at that moment in time?\n\nMR. BLACKABY: I think there is nothing specific. I mean, the Transparency International reports don't go back that far, and the elements which we gave to you go back to 2002.\n\nIn 1996, I mean, the only thing one can state is that, with regard to what happened with the purge - I think you can call it that - in 2003 by the president of the Supreme Court, inevitably, that was a consequence of a clash between the powers.\n\nBut beyond that, with regard to the situation in 1996, you know, the key issue - I guess the more immediate issue for BIVAC was that the very president who had publicly repudiated the debt was the one who had just nominated six out of the nine members of the Supreme Court, and that, therefore, entering into a system which the ultimate destination would be before that court, you know, was not - that was not something that had occurred before 2003.\n\nMR. FORTIER: And that you represented to us drove your - the claimants' decision to resort to an allegation of treaty breach.\n\nMR. BLACKABY: I think in any event, you know, in terms of the conduct that we saw here, we believe that the treatment which we had received was a breach - was a breach of the treaty under various heads.\"262\n\n*Ibid*. para. 115.\n\nHearing on the Merits, 5-7 July 2011, transcript, pp.538-541.\n\n142.\n\nThe Claimant has submitted further evidence in this regard and cites a Paraguayan newspaper article reporting that in 2003 the newly elected President Duarte threatened \"to pulverize the judiciary.\" The Claimant asserts that according to a report of Transparency International, shortly thereafter 7 of the 9 judges of the Supreme Court were removed from office and replaced by new members who\n\n\"were professionals with lower-grade qualifications and experience than those replaced, giving the impression that the president had all along intended to create a more pliable Supreme Court.\"263\n\nBIVAC concludes that local remedies would thus have been futile considering the serious deficiencies in the Paraguayan court system and the repudiatory attitude of the President in 2006, who at the same time had uncontested power to interfere with judicial proceedings.264\n\nTransparency International, Global Corruption Report 2008, Paraguay, 2008, Exhibit CE-137, p. 174; BIVAC PostHearing Brief, para. 118.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 129; BIVAC Memorial, para. 251;\n\n4.3.1.6. Losses Caused by Paraguay's Conduct\n--------------------------------------------\n\n143.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, Paraguay's conduct has prevented the payment of the debt in its entirety for over a decade and is therefore a proximate and direct cause of BIVAC's full loss.265 The Claimant notes that under international law the causal link between the conduct and the loss must be \"sufficient\",266 \"adequate\",267 or \"proximate,\"268 or the loss must be \"attributable to the wrongful act and foreseeable\".269 The Claimant argues that these requirements are fulfilled in the present case as \"the loss sustained by BIVAC was a direct consequence of the failure to act transparently and in good faith in its treatment of the debt, which was not so paid due to Paraguay's conduct in breach of FET\"270 and because \"[t]he government knew their conduct would result in the State capturing the full amount of the debt owed to BIVAC.\"271\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 139; BIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 132.\n\n*SD Myers v.

The Calculation of Damages\n-----------------------------------\n\n145.\n\nClaimant asserts that Paraguay owes BIVAC compensation for the principal amounts set out in the unpaid invoices amounting to US$ 22,016,142. BIVAC notes that Paraguay has not denied the face value of the invoices.274\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 144; Paraguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 28 and 170-171.\n\n146.\n\nAccording to the Claimant, it is also entitled to a payment of interest in the present case. BIVAC refers to the *Vivendi* case where the tribunal held that the liability to pay interest to an injured claimant, as a form of compensation for the loss of use and disposition of the money due, is now \"an accepted legal principle.\"275\n\n*Vivendi II v. Argentina*, para. 9.2.3. The Claimant also refers to *Islamic Republic of Iran v. United States of America* (Iran-United States Claim Tribunal Case No. A19), Decision, 30 September 1987 16 Iran-US CTR 285, para. 12 (CL-120) [hereinafter, *Iran v.

See BIVAC Reply, para. 147.\n\n147.\n\nThe Claimant further argues that interest rate to be applied is that of Dutch commercial transactions because this rate has the closest connection to the present case and to the commercial reality. According to the Claimant, it is far more likely that the sums owed to BIVAC would have been invested in the Netherlands rather than in Paraguay, considering the fact that BIVAC BV is a Dutch corporation that routinely transacts business in the Netherlands and payments under the Contract were made to BIVAC's Dutch bank account.276 The Claimant also argues that the Treaty supports this conclusion, since its provision on expropriation refers to interest \"at a normal commercial rate,\"277 which is better reflected in the Netherlands' rate than in Paraguay's rate, considering the latter's \"uneven commercial and macroeconomic conditions.\" The Claimant adds that this has been the practice of the Iran-US Claims tribunal278 as well as other ICSID tribunals.279\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 140; BIVAC Reply, para. 147.\n\nTreaty, Article 6, Exhibit CE-66.\n\nThe Claimant refers to *Sylvania Technical Systems v. Iran*, Award, (27 June 1985), CL-119, p. 13 [hereinafter, *Sylvania v. Iran* ] in which the Tribunal awarded a U.S. company \"the average rate of interest on six-month U.S. certificates of deposit\".\n\nThe Claimant refers to cases under the US/Argentina BIT which \"have consistently awarded US claimants the interest rate applicable to either short-term US Treasury Bills or six-month certificates of deposit\": *LG&E v. Argentina*, para. 102; *CMS v. Argentina*, para. 471; *Azurix v. Argentina*, para. 440; BIVAC Reply, para. 148.\n\n148.\n\nMoreover, the Claimant submits that a commercial rate of interest compounded annually should be applied to each of the unpaid invoices from the date they became due until the date of payment.280 First, according to the Claimant, the award of compound interest is usual practice under international law.281 Second, the Claimant disputes Paraguay's argument that \"the award of compound interest violates Paraguayan law.\"282According to Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Claimant submits that Paraguay cannot rely on its domestic laws to avoid its international obligations to pay interest on the sum due.283\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para. 256.\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 140; BIVAC Reply, para. 151. The Claimant refers e.g. to *Pope & Talbot v. Canada*, Award in respect of damages, 31 May 2002, para. 89 [hereinafter, *Pope & Talbot v. Canada*, Damages]; and cites J Gotanda, \"Compound Interest in International Disputes,\" (2004) Oxford U Comparative L Forum, 1, Part V, (Legal Authority CL-124), p. 19. The Claimant also relies on awards which seem to apply specifically to \"expropriation cases\": see *Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. S.A. v. Arab Republic of Egypt,* (ICSID Case No. ARB/99/6), Award, 12 April 2002, paras. 174175 [hereinafter, *Cement Shipping v. Egypt* ], where the Tribunal held that \"compound (as opposed to simple) interest is at present deemed appropriate as the standard of international law in such expropriation cases.\"\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 172\n\nBIVAC Reply, para. 150.\n\n149.\n\nThus, applying the legal interest rates for Dutch commercial transactions, compounded annually on the principal amounts, the Claimant argues that BIVAC's loss amounted to US$ 63,969,775.13.284\n\nBIVAC Post-Hearing Brief, para. 141.\n\n150.\n\nWith respect to the quantum, the Claimant refutes Paraguay's view that \"BIVAC failed to take reasonable steps to reduce the losses it suffered from Paraguay's alleged wrongful actions..285 According to the Claimant, this argument is unfounded in law and is not supported by the evidence. In the Claimant's view:\n\n\"[\u2026] a contracting party such as BIVAC has the legitimate expectation that the other party (here Paraguay) will perform its side of the bargain unless and until it is informed otherwise. At no stage during performance did Paraguay inform BIVAC that it would cease all payments. There is no rule whereby the performing party has to save a defaulting party from the financial consequences of its own unlawful acts. Further, it is not true that BIVAC \u2018passively sat back and decided to let the debt mount each month.' The evidence is uniform: a sustained - and costly - effort by BIVAC to secure payment.\"286\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras 175-176; BIVAC Reply, para. 152.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 153.\n\n***4.3.2. The Respondent's Position***\n--------------------------------------\n\n151.\n\nThe Respondent rejects the Claimant's allegations and legal arguments and asserts that Paraguay has not breached Article 3(1) of the Treaty. It contends that the applicable FET standard is reflected in customary international law and that Paraguay has not violated this standard (4.3.2.1). Paraguay arues that even if the Tribunal were to accept the Claimant's interpretation of the standard, Paraguay still cannot be held to have violated it because it has not acted arbitrarily, lacking transparency and due process, negligently and inconsistently, in bad faith, and has neither repudiated the debt nor breached BIVAC;s legitimate expectations (4.3.2.2). The Respondent insists that the relationship between Paraguay and BIVAC was commercial in nature and not obstructed by governmental power ('*puissance publique*') (4.3.2.3). It also asserts that Paraguay has not taken \"measures\" and that what it did was not unreasonable and did not impair BIVAC's investment (4.3.2.4). Moreover, the Respondent insists that the dispute must be resolved by the sovereign courts of Paraguay as contractually convened (4.3.2.5). Finally, the Respondent submits that Paraguay's conduct was immaterial to BIVAC's losses (4.3.1.6) and that BIVAC cannot claim contractual damages for alleged breaches of a treaty provision, let alone compound interest at Dutch rates and that damages were not mitigated by Claimant (4.3.2.7).287\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 22-140 and 154-178; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 25-200; and Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 7-134.\n\n4.3.2.1. No violation of the Fair and Equitable Treatment Standard as Defined by Customary International Law\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n152.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the FET clause in the BIT incorporates the international minimum standard under customary international law. The Respondent contends that Paraguay288 and the Netherlands289 each intended the FET standard to refer to the international minimum standard.290 In addition to the intention of the Parties themselves, the Respondent argues that States, including NAFTA parties such as United States291 and Canada, and non NAFTA parties such as Switzerland292 have generally adopted the customary international law minimum standard of FET in bilateral treaties,293 even where the treaty itself does not expressly refer to customary international law. Indeed, the NAFTA Free Trade Commission issued an official binding interpretation of the FET standard recognizing that \"the concepts of \u2018fair and equitable treatment' and \u2018full protection and security' do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law minimum standard\".294 The Respondent submits that this interpretation has been applied in subsequent tribunal awards.295 The Respondent also notes that tribunals outside NAFTA have found that the fair and equitable treatment standard incorporates the international minimum standard,296 while groups such as the International Law Association noted that the fair and equitable treatment clause is an example of treaty practice.297\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 79-80. As evidence relating to itself, the Respondent cites Paraguay's membership in Group 77 and its own interpretation of fair and equitable treatment for the purposes of the present arbitration.

The Respondent alleges that BIVAC's exclusive reliance on tribunal awards ignores the history of the international minimum standard and the consistent expressions by States, which recognize that the FET standard incorporates the international minimum standard.299\n\nThe Respondent refers to interpretations of Article 31(3)(c) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties by various Tribunals: the ICJ, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, and investor-State Tribunals have interpreted undefined and ambiguous treaty terms to incorporate their meaning from customary international law pursuant to Art. 31(3)(c).

Instead, the Respondent argues that the tribunal in *Pope & Talbot* subsequently confirmed the binding nature of the minimum standard interpretation in the award for damages, and that while the tribunal in *Mondev* observed that the FET standard in NAFTA could not exceed customary international law, and the tribunal in *Azurix* interpreted a violation of the FET standard as \"conduct below international standards.\"303 In addition, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's position that the fair and equitable treatment standard in the BIT can be interpreted through reference to dictionaries, noting that such an approach has been rejected by tribunals because it does not provide a defined legal standard.304 The Respondent also alleges that the Claimant's approach subverts the purpose of the \"Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which in reality makes clear that background principles of customary international law supply the definition of treaty terms when that is the intent of the treaty parties.\"305 Finally, the Respondent argues that the Claimant's proposed analysis is contrary to the ICSID Convention and transforms a legal term with a defined meaning in customary international law into an implicit consent for arbitrators to decide *ex aequo et bono*, a standard to which no State would agree.306\n\n*Pope & Talbot Inc v.

Indeed, the ordinary-meaning approach that BIVAC advocates would conflict with the ICSID Convention, which only permits a decision ex aequo et bono if the parties specifically consent.\n\n155.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, the content of the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law may differ depending on the context or State conduct in question. However, the burden to prove that a specific rule has been breached rests with the Claimant.307 Irrespective of the application of context-specific rules or a general standard, BIVAC has not proven that Paraguay breached such standard of FET.308\n\n*Tradex Hellas S.A. v. Republic of Albania*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/94/2), Award, 29 April 1999, para. 74 [hereinafter, *Tradex v. Albania* ]; *Glamis Gold v. United States*, para. 601; *ADF Grp., Inc. v.

The Respondent considers that the Claimant's position relies on evidence from scholars310 and arbitrators, but it is only States that can create customary international law by means of State practice and *opinio juris*.311 Thus, whether or not scholars and arbitrators had the intention to set out a general standard is irrelevant to the question of the existence of such a standard.312 Additionally, \"[a]s a matter of State practice, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina and the Czech Republic have expressly accepted that *Neer* represents contemporary customary international law.\"313 Further, the \"ICJ, the Iran-U.S. Claims Tribunal, and investor-State tribunals have interpreted undefined and ambiguous treaty terms to incorporate their meaning from customary international law pursuant to Article 31(3)(c)\".314 The Respondent further disputes the relevance of each award cited by the Claimant, alleging that they make little effort to investigate State practice; that they contain no analysis of official State positions; make no mention of domestic judicial decisions; and that they mostly rely on awards of other arbitral tribunals instead of State practice to construe the FET standard.315\n\n*Neer v.

It appears, based on the authorities cited above, that the United States accepts the Neer test as a statement of customary international law as to the requirement to provide a minimum level of security and perhaps as to the obligation not to deny justice; *Glamis Gold v.

The Respondent disputes the facts listed by BIVAC in support of its claim and denies that its conduct amounts to a breach of the fair and equitable treatment under any standard. It presents the facts as follows:323\n\n\u2022 \"Paraguay objected to BIVAC's invoices even before the Parties terminated the Contract. Two months before the mutual termination of the Contract, the Ministry of Finance formally objected to BIVAC's invoices from June 1997 to December 1997 and from March 1998 due to BIVAC's failure to comply with the obligations set forth in Section 5 of the Contract;324 and payments under the Contract started to be withheld as early as 1996;325\n\n\u2022 report by the Comptroller General of Aduanas on 30 March 1999 where it is reported that BIVAC had not held the training programs required of it by Article 2.9;326\n\n\u2022 letter to Minister of Finance, dated 22 June 1999, which makes reference to a series of contractual breaches, including failure to provide technical assistance as required by the Contract, inspection of exempt goods, and irregular issuance of CIs in order to generate higher fees;327\n\n\u2022 report from the Contralor\u00eda, dated 25 July 2001, reporting several instances of noncompliance with the Contract and its regulations, such as: (1) the failure to obtain authorized signatures on some CIs; (2) failure to send some documents electronically as required by Resolution 1171/96; and (3) the failure to create the required database, among other problems;328\n\n\u2022 report from the Ministerio's internal auditor dated 28 January 2003, which observes several instances of non-compliance, including that exempt merchandise was being inspected at a cost to the State, and failure to provide technical assistance, among others;329\n\n\u2022 report from Aduanas Director, Margarita D\u00edaz de Vivar, dated 30 March 2005, reporting that clause 2.9 of the Contract was not complied with. Although BIVAC says this Report cleared BIVAC from any wrongdoing, Ms. Vivar's Report observes that BIVAC did not comply with its technology transfer obligations under the Contract;330\n\n\u2022 The Respondent further states \u2018that BIVAC failed to screen the PSI requests it received from importers is not in dispute' [...], \u2018that BIVAC was responsible for ensuring that exempt goods were not inspected' [...] and that \u2018Paraguay estimates as much as 50% of the certificates of inspection BIVAC issued were undue because they corresponded to Mercorsur goods, a material deviation of the stated goals of the Contract (increased revenue) and PSI regulations.'\"331\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 124; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 79.\n\nExhibit CE-70.\n\nExhibit RE-15.\n\nExhibit RE-19.\n\nExhibit RE-21; (translation: \"There is also evidence of bills of lading for amounts higher than $21,800 that have two, three or more Certificates of Inspection, which, in many cases, do not reach individually the minimum amount.

It argues that the Claimant relies on five documents for its allegation and that these five documents are inconclusive:\n\n\"The first document is a letter by Minister Zayas dated July 31,1998 (almost a year before the Contract was terminated), in which Mr. Zayas merely relays the number of invoices pending payment and expresses the desire to pay a third of them and to dispose of the rest ($12 million out of $18 million) through a \u2018 *concertaci\u00f3n de intereses*,' that is, through mutual concessions.333\n\nThe second document cited by BIVAC is a letter from Minister Zayas dated June 7, 1999, in which Minister Zayas simply gives notice of termination of the Contract. In that letter he makes clear that the termination would not subvert the legal rights and obligations already incurred by both BIVAC and Paraguay. There is no mention of a specific number purportedly owed, much less an acknowledgment of the debt.334\n\nThe third document relied upon by BIVAC is nothing more than a chart listing the outstanding invoices issued by BIVAC and SGS. The title of the chart itself leaves no doubt that the document in question is not an acknowledgement or admission of the debt: \u2018invoices pending payment issued by BIVAC, BV until June 1999.' And although the description of the subtotals for each year uses the word \u2018 *total adeudado*,' it is a stretch to say that this document is anything other than what its title says: a list of pending invoices [...].335\n\nThe fourth document is a letter written by Minister Oviedo-Br\u00edtez to BIVAC dated February 13, 2001, in which Minister Oviedo-Br\u00edtez is only responding to BIVAC's request for payment. The Minister merely says that he assumes that the Contract was duly performed and that an investigation is ongoing. He makes no statement that unequivocally states the position of the Ministry or the government that BIVAC is due all that it claims is owed.336\n\n70. Finally, BIVAC relies upon a letter dated April 19, 2004, by Minister Miguel G\u00f3mez. In that letter Minister G\u00f3mez states that he is working on finding a solution for the claimed amounts, including a schedule of payments that is in accordance with the financial possibilities of the Paraguayan State, and then requests a new meeting with BIVAC's representatives in order to negotiate the outstanding invoices. This is not an unequivocal promise to pay the debt, as BIVAC claims. It is a letter setting parameters of a settlement negotiation.337\n\nThe other letters BIVAC cites are instances where Paraguay attempted to resolve the outstanding invoices amicably, first by offering half of the amounts outstanding and then by offering to pay in government bonds.338 These statements simply cannot be used by BIVAC as evidence that the debt is undisputed. They are statements in the course of settlement negotiations, and under international law they cannot in good faith be relied upon by BIVAC to show that the amounts are owed.\"339\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 78.\n\nExhibit CE-68.\n\nExhibit CE-19.\n\nExhibit CE-22.\n\nExhibit CE-92.\n\nExhibit CE-31.\n\nExhibits CE-73 and CE-75.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 66-71\n\n164.\n\nAs to the Report by the Comptroller General of 4 October 2002 on which BIVAC relies, the Respondent submits that it is a technical opinion in response to a request by the Minister, a \"*Dictamen*\" according to Paraguayan administrative law without any legally binding force. It cannot be interpreted as a document acknowledging Paraguay's debt.340\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 72-77; Paraguay Rejoinder, para. 175; Paraguay Counter-Memorial, para. 31.\n\n165.\n\nIn light of these facts, the Respondent submits that Paraguay's conduct does not violate the FET standard as defined by BIVAC because it is not arbitrary (4.3.2.2.1); is transparent and in accordance with due process (4.3.2.2.2); is diligent and consistent (4.3.2.2.3); and in good faith (4.3.2.2.4). The Respondent also contends that it did not repudiate the debt (4.3.2.2.5) nor did it breach BIVAC's legitimate expectations (4.3.2.2.6).\n\n*4.3.2.2.1. No Arbitrariness*\n-----------------------------\n\n166.\n\nThe Respondent rejects that arbitrariness is part of the fair and equitable treatment standard,341 yet at the same time and without expressing any reservations, it cites the awards in *Parkerings v. Lithuania* and *Pantechniki v. Albania* which have both held that arbitrariness and breach of contract may constitute unfair and inequitable treatment.342 Be that as it may, the Respondent denies the allegation that its conduct was arbitrary. It reiterates that the commissions and reports were only internal measures that did not impair the Claimant's rights and that its refusal to pay the invoices was valid because BIVAC had not complied with its contractual obligations regarding the creation of a database, the provision of technical assistance, and compliance with the regulatory scheme. The economic reality of the Contract, which cost Paraguay more than it was able to recover in taxes, must equally be taken into consideration.343\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 137.\n\n*Parkerings v.

The Respondent contends that those legal remedies were available to BIVAC at any point since 1997 for the alleged non-payment of the debt and allegedly wrongful commissions and investigations.345\n\n*ELSI Elettronica Sicula SpA (ELSI), (United States of America. v.

Argentina* applies to the present case.346 In *Siemens*, Argentina acted so as to frustrate the purpose of the contract and the investor's legitimate expectation by not providing an authorization needed by the investor. Paraguay contends that in the present case it did not change any regulation or requirement to make BIVAC's performance more difficult or impossible.347\n\n*Siemens v. Argentina,* Paraguay Counter-Memorial, para. 129.\n\n*Id.*\n\n169.\n\nThe Respondent relies on *Pantechniki v. Albania*, in which the tribunal held that:\n\n\"It is true that arbitrary decisions may constitute unfair and inequitable treatment and that an ICSID tribunal in a general sense has jurisdiction to deal with the merits of such claims. Yet this proposition is immediately defeated if the particular claim of arbitrariness has been voluntarily submitted to another jurisdiction. It transpires on examination that the alleged arbitrariness is said to arise by reason of Albania's refusal to compensate. That is precisely the issue which the Claimant (to its current regret) took to the Albanian courts. I could not rule on it without violating my own jurisdictional constraints.\"348\n\n*Pantechniki v. Albania,* para. 87; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 35-36.\n\n*4.3.2.2.2. Transparency and Due Process*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n170.\n\nParaguay refutes BIVAC's contention of lack of due process for the the same reasons it rejects arguments with regard to arbitrariness:\n\n\"BIVAC had an effective legal remedy for both the non-payment and the allegedly wrongful investigations: a contract suit in court. A judicial proceeding - complete with all of the rights of a litigant to present evidence, subpoena and call witnesses, appeal adverse decisions, and enforce a judgment in its favor - is the epitome of due process.\"349\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 151.\n\n171.\n\nThe Respondent further argues that it did not fail to act in a transparent manner. It describes, as undisputed, that the investigations and reports were not conducted secretly and that the results were all communicated to BIVAC. It objects to the allegation that BIVAC was not invited to offer its view of the facts. Paraguay, referring to *Metalclad v. Mexico*, where the tribunal had suggested that transparency requires the unhindered availability of information on laws and regulations with respect to the investment, asserts that the legal regime in Paraguay was incontestably known by Claimant.350\n\n*Metalclad v. Mexico*, para. 76; see Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 153-154;\n\n*4.3.2.2.3. No Negligence and No Inconsistency*\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n172.\n\nAs with arbitrariness, the Respondent also denies that inconsistency and negligence are factors relevant to the FET standard.351 This being the case, however, it asserts that it did not act negligently nor inconsistently.352 Unlike the respondents' conduct in disputes cited by Claimant, such as *Kardossopoulos*353 and *PSEG*,354 where the tribunals had found inconsistent and negligent conduct for procedural and substantial unfairness during the negotiation processes, Paraguay's alleged errors took place in internal, non-binding investigations with no effect on relations with BIVAC. The process of negotiations was therefore not possibly tainted with inconsistencies or negligence.355\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 137 and 155.\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 134 and 135; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 155-157.\n\n*Kardassopoulos and Fuchs v.

No Bad Faith*\n-------------------------\n\n173.\n\nThe Respondent denies it acted in bad faith. It alleges that the standard for proving bad faith under international law requires \"clear and convincing evidence\" that the State engaged in such conduct.356 In the present case, the Claimant did not show that Paraguay's conduct meets that standard. Paraguay argues that it had \"legitimate concerns\" with regard to paying BIVAC and that the Tribunal cannot, as the Claimant contends, \"infer\" bad faith merely from the withholding of payment. Further, relying on the Tribunal's Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Respondent alleges that any allegations of bad faith surrounding non compliance with its contractual obligations are subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Paraguayan courts.357\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 136-138; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 158-161. The Respondent relies on the arbitral awards in *Tacna-Arica Question (Chile v. Peru),* 2 R.I.A.A. 1925 at paras. 921, 930 [hereinafter, *Tacna-Arica* ]; *Siemens v. Argentina*,; and *Bayindir v.

Russia* ].\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 68-72 and 161; and the Tribunal's Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 146 (holding that \"the parties to the Contract, including BIVAC, intended the exclusive contractual jurisdiction of the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n to be absolute and without exception\").\n\n*4.3.2.2.5. No Repudiation*\n---------------------------\n\n174.\n\nThe Respondent assures \"that it has never repudiated any of BIVAC's contractual rights, including the right to payment.\"358 Paraguay asserts that the Claimant does not contest that investigation results and reports prepared by Paraguayan officials which confirmed a right to payment. With regard to political speeches and communications including former President Duarte's statement,the Respondent contends that although these voiced doubts as to the payment obligations, they also insisted that they would only pay a debt that is clear and/or legally valid. Finally, it argues that Paraguay never closed the door to Paraguayan courts and would have respected a ruling establishing an obligation to pay the debt.359\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 24; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 187-192.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras, 24 and 28-29.\n\n175.\n\nThe Respondent relies in its assessment on *Waste Management, EnCana* and *Parkerings* and quotes the tribunals' decisions:\n\n\"[t]he Mayor was not purporting to *exercise legislative authority or unilaterally to vary the contract*. He was not *intervening by taking some extra-legal action[...]*. He was saying what ought to be done, in his view, to allay public concerns which did in fact exist at the time. Individual statements of this kind made by local political figures in the heat of public debate may or may not be wise or appropriate, but they are not tantamount to expropriation *unless they are acted on in such a way as to negate the rights concerned without any remedy*. In fact no action was taken of the kind threatened at the time or later. *Even if it had been taken, the Claimant had remedies available to it, under the Concession Agreement and otherwise*.\"360\n\nand\n\n\"In terms of the BIT the executive is entitled to take a position in relation to claims put forward by individuals, even if that position may turn out to be wrong in law, provided it does so in good faith and stands ready to defend its position before the courts. Like private parties, *governments do not repudiate obligations merely by contesting their existence*.\"361\n\nand\n\n\"Under certain limited circumstances, a substantial breach of a contract might constitute a violation of a treaty. [...] In most cases, a preliminary determination by a competent court as to whether the contract was breached under municipal law is necessary. This preliminary determination is even more necessary if the parties to the contract have agreed on a specific forum for all disputes arising out of the contract.\"362\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico*, para. 161, (emphasis added by the Respondent).\n\n*EnCana Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador*, (LCIA Case No. UN3481), Award, 3 February 2006, para. 194, (emphasis added by the Respondent) [hereinafter, *EnCana v. Ecuador* ].\n\n*Parkerings v. Lithuania,* para. 316.\n\n176.\n\nThe Respondent relies on the dicta in these awards to argue that:\n\n\"the failure to pay a contractual debt remains a contract claim, not a treaty claim, when the State leaves open a forum to adjudicate and remedy the alleged breach of contract and does not repudiate the contract by, for example, taking legislative or extra-legal action to eliminate contractual rights or remedies.\"363\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 30.\n\n*4.3.2.2.6. No Violation of Legitimate Expectations*\n----------------------------------------------------\n\n177.\n\nThe Respondent argues that legitimate expectations must be assessed as \"at the time of the investment\".364 According to the Respondent, BIVAC's legitimate expectations at the time of the Contract were \"to perform under the Contract, get paid, or, if insufficient payment was forthcoming, to have the option of stopping performance and suing in the courts of Asunci\u00f3n for contractual breach.\" The Respondent contends none of these expectations were frustrated and that BIVAC cannot complain that its legitimate expectations did not materialize when it itself refused to bring a claim to the Paraguayan courts.365 The Respondent adds that \"contractual expectations\" are distinct from \"expectations as understood in international law\" and that remedy for frustration of the former is to seek redress before a national Tribunal, rather than bring a claim for breach of FET in international law.366\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 165; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19-20; the Respondent relies on *Bayindir v. Pakistan*, paras. 190-191; *Duke Energy v. Ecuador*, para. 340; and *LG&E v. Argentina*, para. 130.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para 165.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 166; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 19; the Respondent relies on *Parkerings v. Lithuania*, para. 344.\n\n178.\n\nThe Respondent disagrees with the argument that the expectation of payment of invoices due under the Contract is the type of expectation protected by the FET standard. Relying on *ELSI*367 and *Waste Management*,368 the Respondent notes that while a breach of contract may be against a rule of law, but in itself a breach of contract is not against the rule of law, or international law.369\n\n*ELSI,* paras. 128-130, (RL-17).\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico,*, para. 115.\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 82-83.\n\n179.\n\nThe Respondent also argues that the Claimant's view suggests that the Ministry's failure to pay BIVAC's invoices can be considered a breach of the FET standard \"as a fall-back provision to its umbrella clause claim.\" The Respondent alleges that such an interpretation is at odds with Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, which requires that terms of a treaty provision be given their ordinary meaning.370 The Respondent further distinguishes its actions from the case in *Azurix* : \"[b]y contrast, here BIVAC and the Ministerio agreed to terminate the Contract and there is no allegation that any branch of the government tortuously interfered with the Contract\" or that Paraguay \"subvert[ed] the contractual or regulatory framework in a way that frustrated BIVAC's legitimate expectations.\"371\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 88.\n\n*Azurix v. Argentina*, paras. 372 and 374-377; Paraguay Counter-Memorial, para. 89.\n\n180.\n\nFinally, the Respondent disputes the Claimant's allegations that Paraguay's alleged lack of political continuity affected and deprived BIVAC of its reasonable expectations. First, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant has failed to address the issue of causation, *i.e.* \"the nexus between the commissions and reports and the impact those had on BIVAC separate from the purported breach of the Contract itself.\" Since BIVAC's alleged losses materialized at the time its invoices became past due, and well before such commissions and reports were ever initiated, the Claimant's choice to pursue a non-litigious resolution and its consequences are to be attributed to the Claimant alone.372 Second, the Respondent alleges that the issue of \"political continuity\" must be dealt with by looking into the circumstances of the individual case. The Respondent suggests that BIVAC was well aware of the political volatility in Paraguay at the time of Contract, just as the the Claimant in *Bayindir* had been aware.373\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 91 and 92.\n\n*Bayindir v. Pakistan*,, paras. 192-193; Paraguay Counter-Memorial, para. 94. The Respondent cites evidence of the Claimant's knowledge of the first democratic elections following a long dictatorship, as well as other events suggestive of political volatility.\n\n4.3.2.3. The Alleged Commercial (not Governmental) Conduct\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n181.\n\nThe Respondent's argument rejecting BIVAC's approach to the breach of Treaty claim is based on the Tribunal's statement in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction \"that BIVAC would have to meet a threshold for treaty claims that requires it to establish acts by or attributable to Paraguay that show an act of '*puissance publique*', that is to say \u2018activity beyond that of an ordinary contracting party'\".374 The Respondent alleges that the Claimant has failed to satisfy this test, and that its theories on liability and on damages demonstrate that the claims are fundamentally contractual and that Paraguay's conduct was not sovereign in nature.\n\nTribunal's Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, para. 125.\n\n182.\n\nThe Respondent argues that sovereign acts give rise to sovereign liability in a forum for sovereigns, while commercial acts give rise to private liability in a private forum. Only a sovereign State's acts can violate the standard of treatment under the BIT and this view is consistent with the Tribunal's holding in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction and a wider *jurisprudence constante.*375 Consequently, the Respondent argues that a commercial act such as failure to pay a debt due under a contract is not, as such, a breach of international law.376 The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's arguments that any act of the state, either *iure imperii* or *iure gestionis*, can violate international law. Instead, the Respondent advances its own interpretion of the authorities cited by the Claimant377 to argue that the rules surrounding state conduct require an analysis of the sovereign or commercial nature of the State's actions. It refers to modern developments of national and international law which distinguish between public and commercial actions of States on the basis of the nature of the contractual relationship and not to its purpose as Claimant asserts.378 The Respondent submits that there is no evidence in the present case to allow for the conclusion that the parties to the BIT clearly intended for the BIT to apply to commercial acts, and that such an intention would be required under international law in order to derogate from well established principles.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 34-37.

Paraguay Rejoinder para. 35.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 98; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 59-60; the Respondent cites the United Nations Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, Article 2(2), (not yet in force), (\"In determining whether a contract or transaction is a \u2018commercial transaction on [...] reference should be made primarily to the nature of the contract or transaction\"), (RL-40); *Playa Larga v. I Congreso del Partido*, [1983] 1 A.C. 244, 267 (H.L.), (Lord Wilberforce), (\"[T]he court must consider the whole context in which the claim against the state is made, with a view to deciding whether the relevant act(s) upon which the claim is based, should, in that context, be considered as fairly within an area of activity, trading or commercial, or otherwise of a private law character, in which the state has chosen to engage, or whether the relevant act(s) should be considered as having been done outside that area, and within the sphere of governmental or sovereign activity.\"), (RL-41); *Ibid*. at 278 (Lord Bridge of Harwich), (\"[I]f a sovereign state voluntarily assumes a purely private law obligation, it cannot, when that obligation is sought to be enforced against it, claim sovereign immunity on the ground that the reason for assuming the obligation was of a sovereign or governmental character.\"); *Republic of Argentina v.

Ct.), (RL-43) [hereinafter, *Collision Case* ]\n\n183.\n\nFurther, the Respondent argues the Tribunal's interpretation of the BIT must comply with the principle of in *dubio mitius*, as recognized in international law, which provides that \"[i]f the meaning of a term is ambiguous, that meaning is to be preferred which is less onerous to the party assuming an obligation, or which interferes less with the territorial and personal supremacy of a party, or involves less general restrictions upon the parties.\"379\n\nWorld Trade Organization Appellate Body Report, European Communities - Measures Concerning Meat and Meat Products (Hormones), para. 165, n.154, WT/DS26/AB/R, WT/DS48/AB/R (16 January 1998) (quoting R. Jennings & A. Watts eds.,Oppenhim's International Law 1278 (9th ed. 1992)). Paraguay Rejoinder para. 41.\n\n184.\n\nFurthermore, the Respondent disagrees with the Claimant's argument that the cases of *Bayindir*, *Impregilo* and *RFCC*, in which it was held that commercial acts do not violate BIT provisions such as the FET clause, can be distinguished from the circumstances in the present case.380 The Respondent goes on to allege that the Tribunal must apply the rule in *Waste Management* to the effect that \"even the persistent non-payment of debts by a municipality is not to be equated with a violation of Article 1105 [of NAFTA (fair and equitable treatment)], provided that it does not amount to an outright and unjustified repudiation of the transaction and provided that some remedy is open to the creditor to address the problem.\"381\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 42.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 45, referring to *Waste Management. v. Mexico,* paras. 112 and 115.\n\n185.\n\nThe Respondent also disagrees with with the Claimant's interpretation of *Noble Ventures* as a basis for the Tribunal to reconsider its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction. Paraguay asserts that the Claimant's interpretation confuses the issue of State attribution of an internationally wrongful act with whether that act was internationally wrongful in the first place.382 Relying on the ILC Articles on State Responsibility,383 the Respondent alleges that the question here is not whether a commercial act of a State organ is attributable to the State (as it was in *Noble Ventures*), but whether the primary obligations established in the BIT are violated by commercial acts. *Noble Ventures* supports the view that there exist a general rule whereby breach of a contract by a State, under normal circumstances, does not give rise to direct responsibility on the part of the State under international law.384\n\n*Noble Ventures v. Romania*, at paras. 81-82, (CL-48); BIVAC also relies on the statement in *Noble Ventures* that a distinction between sovereign and commercial acts is difficult to draw. BIVAC Reply, para. 63. However, the German Federal Constitutional Court held in the Claim Against the Empire of Iran case, \"[t]he fact that it is difficult to draw the line between sovereign and non-sovereign state activities is no reason for abandoning the distinction.

First, the Respondent claims that in none of these cases are the facts parallel to those in the present case, since they involved the abuse of State sovereign authority; procedurally and substantially unfair administrative negotiations proceedings; the absence of an efficient remedy against governmental decisions whereas according to the Respondent, the present case involves an alleged breach of contract. It concludes that\n\n\"[A]ll of the cases on which BIVAC relies are consistent with the principle that a claimant cannot transform a breach of contract into a breach of treaty merely by saying that the breach of contract was unfair, arbitrary, nontransparent, or negligent when the State offers an adequate contract remedy, which it does not frustrate or repudiate. To the extent that any of these cases could be said to involve a breach of contract by the State, the claimants had treaty claims, not contract claims, because the State had not offered or had frustrated a fair legal process to address the alleged breach of contract.\"386\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 44-63; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 49-56.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 63.\n\n187.\n\nAccording to the Respondent, given that only sovereign, governmental and public conduct on behalf of the State of Paraguay consisting an abusive interference with the Contract could have given rise to a claim for violation of the FET standard, the Claimant has to prove that such conduct was indeed exercised. The Respondent argues that the Claimant failed to do so since it did not show that Paraguay had used \"its police, adjudicatory, or legislative powers to the detriment of the rights of the claimant\" which is a requirement for an act to be deemed a sovereign act.387 It is alleged that in reality \"[T]he Ministerio behaved as a normal market player. Its failure to pay sums allegedly due is an act that any private party can commit\" and the internal investigations and reports could also \"have been undertaken by a corporation to evaluate its post-termination strategies.\"388 BIVAC \"attempts to turn an ordinary commercial dispute into a misuse of sovereign power\".389 According to the Respondent, the attempt to characterize the Respondent's actions as governmental also fails because \"a private entity certainly can hire a third party to help it collect revenue and prevent fraud; these are not uniquely sovereign goals. A private party can also rely on macroeconomic factors, including an economic downturn, to explain non-payment under a contract\"390. In sum:\n\n\"Any private party can refuse to pay under a contract. Commercial disputes routinely involve alleged non-payment under contracts for goods or services. A private party can also make statements purportedly consistent with a desire to pay but still refuse payment. And a private company can conduct internal investigations or audits regarding a contracting partner's performance under a contract to determine whether requested payment is consistent with the parties' contractual obligations.\"391\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 99; Paraguay Rejoinder, para. 57; Paraguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 103-105.\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 104\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 3.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 58.\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 63.\n\n188.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent contends that the Claimant's allegations regarding Paraguay's wrongful refusal to pay and the investigations into BIVAC's claims for payment do not support its arguments because they incorrectly focus on the purported purpose of the alleged acts rather than their nature. According to the Respondent, none of these allegations demonstrates the misuse of governmental authority or the application of '*puissance publique*'*.* Further, the Respondent alleges that to determine whether an act is commercial or sovereign, the Tribunal can make an analogy with the law of sovereign immunity, whereby an act is commercial if its nature (rather than its purpose) is commercial. Paraguay explains that the purpose for which it entered into the contract and refused payment is not determinative as to the sovereign or private characterization of the acts. Looking at the distinction in nature between a sovereign and a private act, the Respondent submits that in the present dispute the elements of private acts are present, whereas the elements of sovereign acts are absent.392\n\n*Ibid.*, para. 63.\n\n189.\n\nFinally, the Respondent submits that internal reports generated to advise the State as to whether payment is due to a contracting party which request it, as well as statements in response to such requests for payment, are not legislative, administrative, or quasi- judicial acts.393 The Respondent further argues that since Paraguay did not undertake sovereign acts in the present case, such as a legislative decree to cancel the Contract, and since it has never claimed that its non-payment was unchallengeable in Paraguayan courts, there was no sovereign act to abrogate or cancel the contract.394 The Respondent maintains that persistent non-payment under a contract constitutes an indisputably commercial act and thus is not proof of sovereign authority sufficient to violate Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 64; The Respondent relies on the ICJ decision in *Sovereignty Over Pulau Ligitan and Pulau Sipadan (Indonesia v. Malaysi* a), I.C.J. rep 2002, p. 625, at p. 685, (para. 148) [hereinafter, *Sovereignty Over Pulau* ].\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 65; the Respondent's argument against the existence of a sovereign act in the present case relies on the definition of \"sovereign act\" set out in Shufeldt Claim (United States ex rel. *P.W. Shufeldt v. Republic of Guatemala*), see: Schwebel, \"*On Whether the Breach by a State of a Contract with an Alien is a Breach of International Law,\"* in Justice in International Law 425, 432 (1994), (RL 37).\n\n4.3.2.4. The **A** bsence of **U** nreasonable **M** easures\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n190.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that the Claimant has not proven that Paraguay engaged in unreasonable measures because: (i) it has not shown that the Respondent's statements or investigations constitute \"measures\" as defined under the BIT; (ii) the Respondent's acts were not unreasonable; and (iii) the alleged acts did not impair the Claimant's investment.\n\n191.\n\nFirst, the Respondent alleges that State conduct without legal effect cannot constitue a \"measure\" under international law. The internal reports on which BIVAC relies were not \"measures\" because \"[t]hey were not binding administrative proceedings and had no legal effect.\" Rather, they were \"meant to advise the Paraguayan government as to whether or not BIVAC was entitled to payment.\" Further, the Respondent also denies that the alleged statements (the letters or statements made during meetings) constitute \"measures\".395\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 175-177; the Respondent refers to *Lauder v. Czech Republic,* (UNCITRAL), Award, 3 September 2001, paras. 245, 283-284 [hereinafter, *Lauder v. Czech Republic*], and WTO Panel Report, Japan - Measures Affecting Consumer Photographic Film & Paper, 10.122, WT/DS44/R (31 March 1998), where an internal investigation report setting out possible options for the government was not considered a \"measure\".\n\n192.\n\nSecond, and in the event that the Respondent's conduct is considered as \"measures\" by the Tribunal, the Respondent argues the measures were reasonable and do not constitute a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT.396 According to the Respondent, tribunals have recognized that State acts purportedly contrary to law but that can be corrected through judicial process do not constitute a breach of the general standard of treatment.397 The Respondent disputes the Claimant's view that such a rule imposes a requirement to exhaust local remedies. Instead, the Respondent argues that where the basis of an alleged breach of an investment treaty is a violation of a contract or the disregard of contractual rights, the Claimant's failure to seek an available remedy for such acts in the contractually designated forum renders the alleged breach of international law merely inchoate. According to the Respondent, State practice supports this view.398The Respondent also argues that this interpretation is consistent with the annulment committee's decision in *Helnan* and *Vivendi*, where it was acknowledged that in some circumstances the failure to seek remedies in the local courts may be relevant when deciding whether State's conduct has violated a treaty standard.399\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 178-186.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 179; e.g., *Vivendi v.

Republic of Hungary*, (ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22), Award, 23 September 2010, at para. 10.3.3 [hereinafter, *AES v.

The alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Tribunal*\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n\n194.\n\nIn the Respondent's view, the agreement to bring \"any conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to this Contract, non compliance, resolution or invalidity [...]\"402 before Paraguayan courts, entails two consequences with respect to the present dispute.\n\nArticle 9.1 of the Contract, (Exhibit CE-6).\n\n195.\n\nFirst, it establishes the exclusive competence of these courts over disputes concerning the Contract, thus barring the Tribunal's jurisdiction. The Respondent alleges that \"BIVAC has always had the unimpeded right to resort to the Paraguayan judiciary\", even while negotiations and investigations were under way403 and that this remedy was effective for both the non-payment and the alleged wrongdoing.404 It insists that BIVAC's assertions are nothing more than an attempt to avoid its obligation to bring a contractual claim in the Paraguayan courts thus circumventing \"freely made contractual choices.\"405\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 105; also Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 30 and 91-95.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 151 and 163.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 1, 4 and 30.\n\n196.\n\nThe Respondent further disagrees with Claimant's assertion that the requirement to bring the dispute before local courts amounts to a local-exhaustion condition. It argues that the question in the present case is not one of denial of justice but of applying the Parties' autonomous agreement in the appropriate forum.406\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 136.\n\n197.\n\nOn the other hand the forum selection clause has a direct bearing on the ascertainment of Treaty obligations. The Respondent asserts that:\n\n- BIVAC cannot prove that \"Paraguay unfairly treated its right to payment because that right must first be established in Paraguay,\"407\n\n- it is not possible to establish the repudiation of the debt as long as the investor's rights are protected by an effective remedy to courts,408\n\n- arbitrariness or lack of due process cannot be established as long as effective legal remedies by way of a \"suit in court\" exist,409 and\n\n- no legitimate expectation is frustrated as long as Paraguay does not \"block BIVAC's access to court.\"410\n\nFinally, the Respondent states that at \"no time, and in no way, did anyone prevent BIVAC from initiating a collection suit in Asunci\u00f3n.\"411\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 18.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 26 and 30; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 162-164.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 150 and 151.\n\n*Ibid.*, paras. 165-166.\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 3.\n\n198.\n\nThe Respondent relies on *Parkerings v. Lithuania*, where the Tribunal held:\n\n\"Under certain limited circumstances, a substantial breach of a contract could constitute a violation of a treaty. So far, case law has offered very few illustrations of such a situation. In most cases, a preliminary determination by a competent court as to whether the contract was breached under municipal law is necessary. This preliminary determination is even more necessary if the parties to the contract have agreed on a specific forum for all disputes arising out of the contract. [...]\n\nHowever, if the contracting-party is denied access to domestic courts, and thus denied opportunity to obtain redress of the injury and to complain about those contractual breaches, then an arbitral tribunal is in position, on the basis of the BIT, to decide whether this lack of remedies had consequences on the investment and thus whether a violation of international law occurred. In other words, as a general rule, a tribunal whose jurisdiction is based solely on a BIT will decide over the \"treatment\" that the alleged breach of contract has received in the domestic context, rather than over the existence of a breach as such.\n\nIn the case at hand, there is no doubt that BP had access to the Lithuanian Courts. [...] The experts confirmed that the Lithuanian Courts are independent and that levels of corruption had declined substantially.\n\n[...] The failure to complain of the violation of the Agreement before the Lithuanian Court leads to two consequences. First, the Claimant failed to show that the Municipality of Vilnius terminated the Agreement wrongfully and therefore breached the Agreement. Second, even supposing that the Agreement has been wrongfully terminated, the Claimant failed to show that the right of BP to complain of the breach of the Agreement has been denied by the Republic of Lithuania and thus that its own investment was actually not accorded, by the Respondent, an equitable and reasonable treatment in such circumstances.\"412\n\n*Parkerings v. Lithuania*, paras. 316-319 (footnotes omitted); Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 16-17; Paraguay Rejoinder, para. 71. The Respondent equally relies on *Pantechniki v. Albania*, para. 87 (quoted at para. 169 of this Decision).\n\n*4.3.2.5.2. The Alleged Insufficiency of the Paraguayan Court System*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n199.\n\nThe Respondent strongly objects to BIVAC's argument that Paraguayan courts are so corrupt, sluggish, expensive and inefficient that any resort to them would be futile and that it can therefore not be expected to litigate in Paraguay.413 It does so on two counts. It firstly argues that\n\n\"[T]his argument rings especially hollow given that BIVAC agreed by contract to the jurisdiction of the Paraguayan courts. It cannot negate its contractual obligation by now claiming that the forum to which it agreed was never in a position to grant justice. And it is unlikely that a sophisticated multinational company like BIVAC would have accepted the jurisdiction of a forum that it believed would deny it justice. Indeed, Paraguayan courts have taken the side of foreign investors against the government in recent cases.\"414\n\nSecondly, it submits that BIVAC changed the argument only during the hearing to accommodate the Tribunal's question to this effect by suddenly asserting \"for the first time that \"the Paraguayan courts have deteriorated in the time since it signed the Contract\" and \"that the forum-selection clause could no longer be respected.\"415\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 130-136; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 104-122; comments of the Attorney General of Paraguay during the hearing on the Merits, 5-7 July 2011, transcript, pp. 290-296.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 130; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 104.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 104 and 106.\n\n200.\n\nThe Respondent invites the Tribunal to reject the Claimant's submission since allegations as to endemic corruption, inefficiency and incompetence are extremely serious matters and can only be accepted by solid evidence, and that such evidence has not been put before the Tribunal.416 It alleges that BIVAC has relied on \"a handful of unreliable reports\" which are devoid of facts and analysis and replete with conclusions about the state of the judiciary based on hearsay and anecdotal evidence, and the authors are not available for cross-examination. It suggests that hearsay has been excluded by international tribunals when not supported by confirmatory evidence.417\n\n\"It would be unfair for the Tribunal even to consider the reports. This is especially true because on this flimsy evidence BIVAC would have the Tribunal make the very consequential finding that Paraguay - a sovereign party to the ICSID Convention and an emerging democracy - has a judicial system that is so corrupt and incompetent that nobody can rely on it.\"418\n\nIt would have been BIVAC's duty to present expert testimony on the state of Paraguay's legal system, and that it has failed to do so.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 109-113 and 115; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 133-134.\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 131-135; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 109-116; the Respondent refers to *EDF (Servs.) Ltd. v.

Egypt*, para. 347 (declining to admit hearsay evidence when no other evidence is submitted to support statements); *Methanex Corp. v.

No losses caused by Paraguay's conduct\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n203.\n\nThe Respondent alleges that BIVAC has failed to prove its damages, since it has not demonstrated the accuracy of its invoices or that it actually performed all of the inspections for which it seeks payment. The Respondent also recalls that BIVAC is not entitled to damages for inspecting goods originating in Mercosur countries that were not subject to import duties or to recover payment for improperly issued certificates.421\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 194-195.\n\n204.\n\nMoreover, the Respondent relies on a holding in the case concerning the *Factory at Chorz\u00f3w* which states that \"reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.\"422 It asserts that the alleged losses, *i.e.* the unpaid invoices, were caused by the alleged breach of contract and not by the conduct on which Claimant has based its treaty claim: if all the investigations, reports and political declarations were \"wiped out\", the Claimant would still be left with unpaid contractual debts. Further, the Claimant cannot prove that losses occurred because it relied on statements made after the termination of the Contract, since they had occurred with its termination and thus could not possibly have been caused by violations of a FET obligation.423 The Claimant has not shown that the investigations and statements on which it relies for its claim under Article 3(1) of the BIT has caused any harm to BIVAC or resulted in the same damages as the alleged breach of contract.\n\n*Factory at Chorz\u00f3w (Germany v.

A) No. 17, (1928), p. 47, [hereinafter, *Chorz\u00f3w* ] Paraguay PostHearing Brief para. 123.\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, paras. 156-161; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 123-126.\n\n4.3.2.7. The calculation of damages\n-----------------------------------\n\n205.\n\nThe Respondent submits that in case the Tribunal awards damages, BIVAC would not be entitled to any interest. It asserts that BIVAC had the responsibility to reduce its losses by pursuing its claim and seeking compensation in a timely fashion. \"Instead, BIVAC passively sat back and decided to let the debt mount each month.\" BIVAC's ten year delay before taking legal action against Paraguay caused the interest demand to balloon is unreasonable424 and in violation of the obligation to mitigate its damages. The Respondent alleges that while the Respondent does not accept the Claimant's allegations, no reasonable person in BIVAC's place that believed that successive governments' tactics were \"empty, baseless, dilatory, clearly unfounded, obviously meant to evade responsibility, and based on a familiar and predictable pattern\", (which the Respondent contests), would have waited ten years to file this arbitration or a contract suit in Paraguay.425 Therefore, the Tribunal should not award interest, which it has the power to do since the award and calculation of interest is not mandatory, but within the Tribunal's discretion.426\n\nParaguay Counter-Memorial, para. 176; Paraguay Rejoinder, paras. 196-200; Re Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras.129-130; the Respondent relies on the ILC's Commentaries on the Articles of State Responsibility (International Law Commission, Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentaries, at p. 93), (RL-36); the Respondent further refers to municipal courts decisions supporting the principle that unreasonable delay in filing suits reduces or eliminates the prejudgment interest: *Blasland, Bouck & Lee, Inc. v.

Bank Mellat* ].\n\n206.\n\nThe Respondent asserts that in case interest is awarded it should be simple interest at a rate based on Paraguayan law, rather than compound interest at a rate based on Dutch law.427 Contrary to BIVAC's contentions, the Respondent denies that the Netherlands interest rate more closely corresponds to the \"normal commercial rate\" under Article 6 of the BIT. According to the Respondent, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention directs the application of Paraguayan law, which is both the law of the Contract and the law of the State party to arbitration:\n\n\"The Dutch rate neither reflects the agreement of the parties, nor is it internationally accepted as the standard interest rate\".428\n\nThe Respondent submits that tribunals have recognized that international law does not require any particular interest rate and that the law of the host State applies to determine the amount of interest due. If at all, the Tribunal should follow the trend of arbitral tribunals and award interest at a maximum rate of LIBOR +2%.429\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, paras. 201-203; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, paras. 132-134.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 132.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 134; the Respondent refers to *National Grid v. Republic of Argentina*, (UNCITRAL), Award, 3 November 2008, para. 294 [hereinafter, *National Grid v. Argentina* ].\n\n207.\n\nAs for compound interest, the Respondent submits430 that this principle violates Paraguayan law which expressly nullifies any clause providing for it,431 and that it has not been accepted by international tribunals such as *Autopista v. Venezuela*432 and further does not correspond to international law as is made clear by the International Law Commission's Commentary to the Articles on State Responsibility, which note that\n\n\"[t]he general view of courts and tribunals has been against the award of compound interest.\n\n[...]\n\nNonetheless, several authors have argued for a reconsideration of this principle, on the ground that \u2018compound interest reasonably incurred by the injured party should be recoverable as an item of damage'. This view has also been supported by arbitral tribunals in some cases. But given the present state of international law, it cannot be said that an injured State has any entitlement to compound interest, in the absence of special circumstances which justify some element of compounding as an aspect of full reparation.\"433\n\nParaguay Rejoinder, para. 204; Paraguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 133.\n\nLaw No. 2339/2003, (RL-23).

The Reasoning and Decision of the Tribunal***\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n208.\n\nHaving concluded that the Claimant has standing to bring this claim for a violation of the BIT, the Tribunal turns to the central issue in this case, namely the question of whether, by its acts or omissions, Paraguay is liable for a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT.\n\n209.\n\nArticle 3(1) provides:\n\n\"Each Contracting Party shall ensure fair and equitable treatment of the investments of nationals of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair, by unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal thereof by those nationals.\"\n\n210.\n\nTo prove a violation of Article 3(1), the Claimant must establish that the actions of Paraguay are of a nature as to give rise to a violation of the treaty obligation set out in that provision. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal addressed one factor that arises where, as in the present case, the claim under Article 3(1) is closely connected to the contractual relationship between Claimant and Respondent in circumstances in which the Contract provides for the resolution of contractual disputes. Having regard to the arguments and evidence then before it, the Tribunal was alerted to the possibility that the dispute may be centered on a failure to pay an outstanding debt owing under the Contract. With this in mind, the Tribunal emphasized in its Decision on Jurisdiction over the Article 3(1) claim (as formulated by the Claimant) that it expressed no view as to\n\n\"whether a persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt, however unreasonable or unwarranted, could of itself ever amount to a violation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment in circumstances in which a contractually agreed remedy remains available\".434\n\nDecision on Objections to Jurisdiction, para 125.\n\n211.\n\nThe Tribunal noted the Award of the Tribunal in *Impregilo SpA v. Pakistan*, on the interplay between treaty claims and contractual claims. The Tribunal in that case stated:\n\n\"In order that the alleged breach of contract may constitute a violation of the BIT, it must be the result of behaviour going beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt. Only the State in the exercise of its sovereign authority ('*puissance publique*'), and not as a contracting party, may breach the obligations assumed under the BIT. In other words, the investment protection treaty only provides a remedy to the investor where the investor proves that the alleged damages were a consequence of the behaviour of the Host State acting in breach of the obligations it had assumed under the treaty.\"435\n\nOn the basis of this approach, which the Tribunal considers to be correct and applicable in the present case, in order to succeed in a claim alleging violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT, the Claimant must show that it meets the threshold for treaty claims. It must show, in other words, that the conduct of Paraguay reflects an act of '*puissance publique*', that is to say \"activity beyond that of an ordinary contracting party.\"\n\n*Impregilo v Pakistan*, para 260.\n\n212.\n\nThe fundamental basis of the treaty claim under Article 3(1), over which this Tribunal has jurisdiction, turns on the interpretation and application of that treaty provision and the alleged conduct of Paraguay (as '*puissance publique*'), and not on the interpretation and application of the Contract as such (although the Contract will necessarily be part of the overall factual and legal matrix which must be considered). In this regard, the Tribunal notes that the interpretation of Article 3(1) of the BIT is not a matter over which the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n would be able to exercise jurisdiction under Article 9 of the Contract. The issue of fair and equitable treatment was not one which the parties to the Contract agreed to refer to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Asunci\u00f3n. The treaty issue is therefore not one for that forum, and there can be no question of an independent or self-standing treaty claim over which the Tribunal has jurisdiction being inadmissible by reason of the choice of forum for the resolution of a dispute under the Contract.\n\n213.\n\nThe Tribunal has paid careful attention to the arguments of the Parties, as they have evolved over the proceedings, as well as the evidence on which they rely in support of their respective arguments as to the treaty claim. In order to determine whether or not there has been a violation of Article 3(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal considers that it must begin by looking at the facts, to establish with precision the conduct of Paraguay that is said to give rise to the alleged violation of the Treaty. The Tribunal must begin by ascertaining whether the facts establish that the conduct of Paraguay amounts only to \"a persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt\", or whether it amounts to something more. Having addressed that issue, the Tribunal must then determine whether the facts as properly characterized can give rise to a violation of Article 3(1) of the Treaty. If the facts show that Paraguay's acts amount only to \"a persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt\", then the Tribunal must decide whether such facts are capable of giving rise to a violation of Article 3(1) of the Treaty; if the facts show something more, as the Claimant alleges (appearing now to accept that a mere failure to make payment on an outstanding debt would not be sufficient to allow a successful claim under Article 3(1)), then the Tribunal must determine whether those facts give rise to a violation of Article 3(1).\n\n4.3.3.1 The Tribunal's appraisal of the facts\n---------------------------------------------\n\n214.\n\nWhat is the conduct of Paraguay that is complained of? As set out at paragraphs 44 -52 above, there is no dispute between the Parties that a Contract was entered into, that certain services were performed under the Contract, that a series of invoices were issued, and that by August 1998 at least some of those invoices were paid. Nor is it in dispute that other invoices remain unpaid since that date.\n\n215.\n\nThe evidence shows that in August 1998 Paraguay's new Government of President Cubas took office, and that shortly thereafter payments for services under the Contract were suspended. In January 1999 the Minister of Finance instigated investigations into the Contract, on the basis of alleged breaches of the Contract. In February 1999, by Presidential Decree No. 2003, the Ministry of Finance was authorised to discontinue the Contract upon termination of its initial term. There is no dispute as to the legality of the discontinuance under the Contract: it was agreed between the Parties, in accordance with the terms of Article 8 of the Contract, which does not require any reason to be stated or there to be any allegation of a breach of contract. There is no claim by the Claimant that the adoption of Decree No. 2003 was in any way in breach of the Contract, or that it violated the BIT.\n\n216.\n\nIn March 1999, following the adoption of the Decree, a number of invoices dating back to 1997 were paid. As matters stood at the end of March 1999, the situation was that the Contract had been lawfully discontinued, but a significant number of invoices under the Contract remained unpaid by the Government. It is these unpaid invoices -that total nineteen in number - that are at the heart of this claim under the BIT.\n\n217.\n\nWhat happened next? By letter dated 7 June 1999, the new Minister of Finance (Federico Zayas) confirmed the Government's decision to discontinue the Contract. He also noted that the obligations of both parties arising under the Contract for the Rendering of Services shall cease \"except the rights already acquired.\"436 The Tribunal considers that the letter recognizes that the Claimant's existing rights under the Contract will not be interfered with, in the sense that \"rights already acquired\" by BIVAC will be honoured. There is no repudiation of any rights under the Contract. Nor, however, does the Tribunal read the letter as amounting to a recognition of the validity of the Claimant's claims to payment under the Contract: it is one thing to recognize the existence of rights under the Contract, but quite another to determine whether such rights include the right to be paid for any particular services and invoices rendered under the Contract.\n\nLetter No. 1158 from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC (7 June 1999), Exhibit CE-19.\n\n218.\n\nMinister Zayas followed this communication with another letter a week later, dated 14 June 1999. This responded to a letter from the Claimant of 8 June 1999, requesting payment of the debt. In his letter, Minister Zayas suggests that it would be appropriate to set out in due course the balance of the debt, and proposes applying a discount of 50% of the outstanding balance as a basis for negotiation.437 The Tribunal considers that this letter, like the earlier one, cannot be interpreted as recognizing BIVAC's right to payment under the Contract; the letter merely proposes a lump sum reduction of the claim as eventually ascertained without offering any reason for the proposed way forward (there is no indication, for example, as to whether the proposal is made for reasons of contractual disagreement or budgetary difficulties, or the existence of other reasons).\n\nLetter no. 1237 from the Minister of Finance to BIVAC (14 June 1999), Exhibit CE-73\n\n219.\n\nOn 22 June 1999, the Ministry of Finance prepared a Report for Minister Zayas that addressed the circumstances of the existing non-payment of the financial obligations under the Contract. The Report identified a series of alleged contractual breaches by the Claimant, including an alleged failure to provide technical assistance as required by the Contract.438 This Report by the Ministry's of Finance technical services purported to list a number of incidents arising in relation to the Contract, and asserted that the Claimant had not complied with its contractual obligations. It also raised a concern about possible double billing by the Claimant, apparently for the first time. The Tribunal expresses no view on the merits of the arguments raised by the Ministry's Report. It recognizes, however, that the concerns raised do set out a *prima facie* plausible explanation for non-payment that is founded on a view of the Contract and an assessment of the facts. As such, the preparation of the Report cannot as such be said to amount to an exercise of sovereign authority that interferes with a right under the Treaty: the report is not qualitatively different from any similar internal report that might have been prepared by a private party to a contract that has formed the view - whether justified or not - that there are grounds for non-payment of a debt owing under a contract to which it is a party.\n\nReport of the Internal Auditor of the Ministry of Finance to the Minister of Finance (22 June 1999), Exhibit RE-21.\n\n220.\n\nOn 6 August 1999, the Ministry of Finance prepared a List of Outstanding Invoices.439 The Claimant asserts that this constitutes a recognition of an outstanding debt. The Respondent disagrees, on the basis that the title of the chart merely refers to invoices for which payment is pending as issued by BIVAC, and does not constitute an admission of a debt. The title indeed leaves no doubt that the document in question is not an acknowledgement or admission of the debt: it is entitled \"invoices pending payment issued by BIVAC\". The Tribunal considers that the document is no more than a list of outstanding invoices. It cannot as such amount to a recognition of a debt owing under the Contract, and its preparation cannot be said to constitute an exercise of sovereign authority, whether or not in violation of a Treaty obligation. The document could just as easily have been prepared by any party to a contract.\n\nList of outstanding invoices prepared by the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit CE-22.\n\n221.\n\nOn 2 December 1999 the Ministry of Finance wrote to the Claimant responding to a further request for payment of the outstanding debt.440 Minister Zayas indicated in the letter that no debt could be paid until the General Comptroller of the Republic had completed a special investigation, in conformity with the request formulated by the Office of the Attorney General in a Note dated 14 July 1999 (a copy of which was attached to the letter). The Tribunal considers that this letter once again relates exclusively to the issue of a payment under the Contract. It does not purport to repudiate any rights under the Contract, and amounts to an action that any nonsovereign contracting party could just as easily follow. There is nothing in the action so initiated that can be said to amount to an exercise of sovereign authority. The Tribunal reaches the same conclusion in relation to the letter sent the following week -on 13 December 1999 - in which Minister Zayas responds to a further request for payment of the debt pending.441\n\nLetter No. 2702 from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC, Exhibit CE-24.\n\nLetter no. 2772 from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC, Exhibit CE-77.\n\n222.\n\nThe following year, in an undated document prepared at some point during 2000, the General Comptroller of the Republic published its first report on alleged irregularities concerning the certificates of inspection issued by the Claimant.442 The Tribunal expresses no view on the report's findings, but concludes once again that there is nothing in the report to support the view that the preparation of the report or its contents reflects an exercise of sovereign authority in respect of rights arising under the Contract. The Claimant's rights under the Contract - in particular the right to be paid and to seek judicial relief before the courts of Asunci\u00f3n if payment is not made -are fully maintained. The preparation of such a report could just as easily have emanated from the bowels of a private contracting party.\n\nFirst Report of the General Comptroller of the Republic regarding the irregularities in the certificates of inspection issued by BIVAC, Exhibit CE-140.\n\n223.\n\nOn 12 February 2001 the Ministry of Finance produced a further report on the matter.443 The report states that the Ministry recognises the validity and existence of the Contract, but that \"the Ministry of Finance cannot effect any payment until the relevant control procedures initiated by the General Comptroller of the Republic are completed.\" The report adds that \"this does not imply in any way that the State is refusing to honor its obligations with respect to said contract.\" The Tribunal reiterates its conclusions as set out above in relation to earlier documents, which apply equally to the Note of 13 February 2001: this indicated the view of the Ministry of Finance that \"once the assignment is concluded by the [General Comptroller of the Republic], and the required account reconciliations are completed, we will proceed with utmost haste to obtain the necessary budgetary amendment from Congress to finance and pay the pending obligation owed by the State for the services rendered by your company...\"444 There is no sovereign interference with the Claimant's rights, including any right to be paid. Throughout this period, the Claimant was free to avail itself of the right of access to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n to resolve the dispute under the Contract.\n\nReport No. 139 of the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit CE-27.\n\nNote No. 185 from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC (only in Spanish), Exhibit CE-92.\n\n224.\n\nOn 25 July 2001, the General Comptroller of the Republic produced its Final Report on certificates of inspection issued by the Claimant.445 The report sought to verify the performance by the Claimant of services under the Contract, to determine \"the facts that could be considered irregular with respect to the formal and substantive aspects of pre-shipment inspection certificates.\" The Report purported to describe instances of alleged non-compliance with the Contract and its regulations, including (1) the failure to obtain authorized signatures on some Certificates of Inspection; (2) the failure to send some documents electronically as required by Resolution 1171/96; and (3) the failure to create the database required by the Contract. The Tribunal expresses no view on any of the allegations made. The Tribunal notes, however, that once again there is nothing in the report that could be said to amount to an interference with the Claimant's rights under the Contract, or an exercise of sovereign authority that goes beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt.\n\nFinal Report of the General Comptroller of the Republic regarding cerificates of inspection issued by BIVAC and Note CGR 3030, Exhibit CE-95.\n\n225.\n\nOver a year later, on 4 October 2002, the General Comptroller of the Republic produced a further Report, concluding that \"the hypothetical non-compliance with the contract or economic harm to the patrimony of the Republic of Paraguay resulting from the performance of said contract, is unfounded.\"446 This apparently clear conclusion followed a statement issued by the General Customs Office in June 2002 which certified that \"there is no existing complaint regarding non-compliance with the contract against [the Claimant].\"447 The Tribunal notes that the October 2002 report appears to be the first occasion on which a body associated with the Respondent states that the Claimant has complied with its obligations under the Contract (the certification by the General Customs Office appears to do no more than state that no claim of non-compliance had previously been made). In response, in its submissions to the Tribunal the Respondent argues that the further report of the General Comptroller of the Republic is non-binding, and was merely advisory in character and not part of an administrative proceeding initiated under Paraguayan law. Whether or not that is an accurate account of the situation pertaining under the law of Paraguay, the fact is that the report provides considerable support for the Claimant's claim to be entitled to be paid on the outstanding debt. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant did not avail at this time, as it could have done, of the right of access to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n to recover the payment which it claimed to be due under the Contract.\n\nReport No. 4249 of the General Comptroller of the Republicto the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit CE-30.\n\nOpinion No. 0501 of the General Customs Office, Exhibit CE-28.\n\n226.\n\nSome nine months later, the situation appears to have changed. On 28 June 2003, the Internal Audit of the Ministry of Finance produced Note No. 21. This found that the Claimant had not complied with the Contract, *inter alia* in relation to matters of preinspection and technical cooperation.448 The Tribunal notes that this finding reiterated the previous finding of the Ministry of Finance (of June 1999, see above at para. 219), but contradicted the more recent report of the General Comptroller of the Republic. The Tribunal is thus faced with a situation in which two government departments have reached apparently different conclusions on the same matter. The two positions are indeed contradictory and cannot be reconciled. Yet there is nothing in the June 2003 note that purports to interfere with the Claimant's rights under the Contract, including the right to have recourse to the contractually agreed forum for the resolution of disputes. The mere fact that a difference of view has arisen within two government departments - not an infrequent occurrence in the life of public authorites --cannot as such amount to an exercise of sovereign authority that goes beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt. The Tribunal is equally aware that an ordinary (non-sovereign) contracting party might equally find itself subject to an internal difference of view as to whether a contractual obligation requires payment of any moneys.\n\nNote A.I. No. 21 from the Internal Auditor of the Ministry of Finance to the Minister of Finance, Exhibit CE-110.\n\n227.\n\nOn 19 April 2004, the Ministry of Finance wrote to the Claimant once more.449 The Ministry stated that it was \"the desire of the National Authorities to honor the debts that the Paraguayan State has with its different creditors, among which is the company that you represent\", adding that it is \"finalizing a study [\u2026] in order to find a solution to the payment of the debt claimed and propose a schedule of payments that is in accordance with the financial possibilities of the Paraguayan State.\" The Tribunal notes that the letter is not on its face an acknowledgement of any outstanding debt, in the sense of an agreed amount, or a commitment to pay any outstanding debt. Moreover, there is nothing in the letter that could be said to amount to an interference with the Claimant's rights under the Contract, or to reflect any exercise of sovereign authority that goes beyond the behaviour of any ordinary party to a contract, or to constitute any inducement for the Claimant to avoid recourse to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n, which remained available. The delay is unfortunate, to say the least, and may even be unjustified as a matter of law under the Contract, but the mere fact of delay cannot as such transform conduct under the Contract (including nonperformance) into a sovereign act that could give rise to a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT. Something more is needed, and this conduct, like that which it follows, relates exclusively to the non-payment of a contractual obligation, and not to anything else.\n\nLetter No. 407 from the Ministry of Finance to BIVAC, Exhibit CE-31.\n\n228.\n\nTwo months later, on 3 June 2004, the Ministry of Finance adopted Resolution No. 274, which determined that the payment of BIVAC's invoices \"are suspended until the veracity of possible irregularities in the companies' compliance with the contract is established.\"450 The Ministry noted that it had \"not yet determined whether there was non-compliance with the contract on the part of [BIVAC]\", and established a Commission to review the matter. The Resolution further stated that \"[p]rior to the commencement of negotiations with the representatives of BIVAC [...] the Commission [created herein] shall establish the definitive position of the Ministry of Finance with respect to whether or not the payment of the pending debts to the inspecting companies is in order.\" The views of the Tribunal as to this conduct is the same as that pertaining to the earlier conduct.\n\nResolution No. 274 of the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit CE-32.\n\n229.\n\nEight months later, on 3 Feb 2005, by Resolution No. 43 the Ministry of Finance resolved that the investigation as to whether any payment should be made to BIVAC under the Contract would be reassigned to the National Customs Office, a branch of the Ministry of Finance, as the Committee tasked by Resolution 374 had concluded that it lacked competence.451 The Tribunal notes the further delay, but sees no basis for concluding that the resolution as such interferes with the Claimant's rights under the Contract, including the right of recourse to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n. The decision reflected in the Resolution cannot as such amount to an exercise of sovereign authority that goes beyond the kind of decision that an ordinary contracting party might also take.\n\nResolution No. 43 of the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit CE-34.\n\n230.\n\nThe following month, on 30 March 2005, the National Customs Office issued Report No. 377. The Report notes that the Claimant has undertaken \"scant verification of preshipments\", that there has been a \"lack of technical cooperation\" and a \"lack of information for the creation of a databank\", and that \"the training mentioned in clause 2.9 was not carried out.\" However, it concluded that \"all possible claims with respect to the compliance or non-compliance with the contract signed by the Minister of Finance and Bivac Paraguay S.A. have already been reported, debated, refuted and dismissed by either the Public Prosecutor or by the General Comptroller of the Republic.\" It further found that the Public Prosecutor and the Comptroller of the Republic had \"already conducted investigations into the contract in question, and both institutions concluded that all of its clauses had been complied with.\"452 The Tribunal takes note of this report, which appears to be conclusive in determining that as at March 2005 the debt that the Claimant claimed to be owed under the Contract was recognized by the relevant authorities of Paraguay as being valid. All that remained, thereafter, was for the amounts to be determined and paid.\n\nReport No. 377 of the General Customs Office, Exhibit CE-35.\n\n231.\n\nDespite this Report, the outstanding debts under the Contract were not paid. Instead, on 22 June 2007, the Ministry of Interior adopted Decree No. 10485, opening a new investigation, apparently at the instigation of the President of the Republic.453 Understandably, having regard to the fact that some eight years had now passed since the matter was first raised, the Claimant decided not to proceed with further efforts at negotiation, and decided instead to have recourse to the settlement of the dispute under the law. Rather than have recourse to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n, as it was still entitled to do under the Contract, it chose to institute ICSID proceedings under the Treaty.\n\nDecree No. 10485 from the Ministry of the Interior, Exhibit CE-136.\n\n232.\n\nBefore summarising the conclusions of the Tribunal as to the facts, it is appropriate briefly to address certain other evidence tendered by the Claimant in support of its contention that the Respondent's conduct constitutes the exercise of sovereign authority such as to be able to violate Article 3(1) of the Treaty.\n\n233.\n\nThe Claimant invokes a number of letters that it has written and sent to Paraguay over the period of the dispute. For example, on 29 May 2001 it wrote to the Ministry of Finance, summarizing the situation, and asserting that the Ministry of Finance had undertaken to pay US$ 5,465,778 for invoices from August, November and December 1997 and to that end would apply to Congress to have this amount included in the 2001 budget.454 A further letter of 6 July 2001 suggests that the Claimant had been shown a budgetary application made to the Congress, to allow payment of US$ 5.4 million to BIVAC in 2001.455 On 6 November 2003, the Claimant wrote to the Ministry of Finance referring to a meeting said to have been held on 8 October 2003, claiming that it was agreed that the Ministry of Finance would examine the matter and suggest a mechanism to pay the outstanding debt which would be negotiated between the parties.456 Additionally, on 23 February 2006 the Claimant wrote once again to the Ministry of Finance, in which it was claimed that the modalities for the payment of the debt were initiated.457 The Tribunal notes that these letters were written by the Claimant, summarizing its perspective of the matters that were said to have taken place, including undertakings alleged to have been given. In the absence of any confirmatory evidence indicating the views of the Respondent, the Tribunal cannot rely on such communications as evidence that such undertakings were in fact given. In any event, on its face none of this material could reasonably be said to reflect any sort of repudiation by Paraguay of the Claimant's rights under the Contract. Nor could the undertakings alleged to have been given - assuming them to be established - be said to amount to an exercise of sovereign authority that goes beyond a conduct which an ordinary contracting party could adopt by analogous actions.\n\nLetter No. 052/D/Lfrom BIVAC to the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit CE-93.\n\nLetter No. 066/D/L from BIVAC to the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit CE-94.\n\nLetter No. 046/D/L from BIVAC to the Ministry of Finance, Exhibit CE-114.\n\nLetter No. 003/D/L from BIVAC to the Minister of Finance, Exhibit CE-37.\n\n234.\n\nThe Claimant also invokes a number of newspaper articles in support of its claims. For example, it refers to an article in *\u00daltima Hora* dated 31 July 2001 (\"*No se pagar\u00e1n deudas a las SGS y la BIVAC*\"), that reports that Minister Oviedo announced that he will not pay a single *guaran\u00ed* to BIVAC without Congress' authorization, as the debt relates to a contract that was entered into by former governments.458 It invokes an article dated 7 May 2005 in *ABC Color* (\"*Hacienda anuncia investigaci\u00f3n de deudas con SGS y BIVAC*\"), which asserts that the Minister will launch a new investigation, notwithstanding the recent report by the Customs Office vindicating the Claimant.459 Another article published by the same newspaper on 18 May 2006 (\"*Gobierno solo pagar\u00e1 las deudas leg\u00edtimas*\", *ABC Color*) includes a quote from President Duarte, during a visit to France, in which it is alleged that he stated that \"I do not have anything to do with previous Governments\" and that no debt would be paid that was not clear.460 The following day a further article was published (\"*Deuda con los franceses data de la era Wasmosy*\", *ABC Color*), alleging a statement by President Duarte that suggested the obligations had been assumed by a previous Government that may not have accrued them lawfully.461 Interesting as they may be, the Tribunal is wary about placing too much reliance on newspaper reports, which may provide an incomplete or partial account of what has been said, even assuming that the quotations are accurately recorded and reproduced. The Tribunal has no objection to treating such reports, which are in the public domain, as admissible but of limited, if any, probative weight. That said, even assuming such reports to be fully accurate, they do not, in the view of the Tribunal, constitute a repudiation by Paraguay of the Claimant's rights to relief under the Contract, or an exercise of sovereign authority that can reasonably be said to go beyond behaviour that an ordinary contracting party might adopt if it had decided not to make a payment owing under a contractual obligation.\n\nExhibit CE-96.\n\nExhibit CE-122.\n\nExhibit CE-131.\n\nExhibit CE-132.\n\n235.\n\nThe Tribunal turns then to the assessment of these facts. In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal concluded that Article 3(4) of the BIT gave it jurisdiction over a claim that arises from or is produced directly in relation to the Contract, but that this included not only the obligation to make payment of invoices in accordance with the requirements of the Contract but also the obligation (implicit if nothing else) to ensure that the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n were available to resolve any \"conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to\" the Contract\" (Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 142). The Tribunal further concluded that the Claimants' case under Article 3(4) was inadmissible because\n\n\"(1) In Article 9(1) of the Contract the parties agreed to a legally binding exclusive jurisdiction clause which provided for the resolution of \"any conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to [the] Contract\" only by the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n;\n\n(2) Article 3(4) of the BIT does not override the exclusive jurisdiction clause of Article 9(1) of the Contract;\n\n(3) \"the fundamental basis of the claim\" presented by BIVAC in respect of Article 3(4) of the BIT concerns a \"conflict, controversy or claim\" arising from or produced in relation to the Contract;\n\n(4) having regard to the need to respect the autonomy of the parties, BIVAC cannot rely on the Contract as the basis of a claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT when the Contract itself refers that claim exclusively to another forum, in the absence of exceptional reasons which might make the contractual forum unavailable;\n\n(5) the proper forum for the resolution of the contractual claim that has been raised under Article 3(4) of the BIT is the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n, applying the law of Paraguay.\" (Decision on Jurisdiction, Para. 159)\n\n236.\n\nAgainst the background of these findings, it is apparent that the parties to the Contract decided that it would be a matter for the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n to determine whether or not Paraguay was in breach of any obligations under the Contract, including the amounts that it might be owing to the Claimant. It is not for this Tribunal to make findings of law as to the interpretation and application of the Contract to the facts. That said, the Tribunal is bound to note that the National Customs Office concluded, in its Report of 30 March 2005, that \"all possible claims with respect to the compliance or non-compliance with the contract signed by the Minister of Finance and Bivac Paraguay S.A. have already been reported, debated, refuted and dismissed by either the Public Prosecutor or by the General Comptroller of the Republic\", and that the Public Prosecutor and the Comptroller of the Republic had \"concluded that all of [the Contract's] clauses had been complied with\" by the Claimant.462 On the basis of the record before the Tribunal, it does not see any real possibility of new facts or legal arguments emerging so long into the dispute that could now change this conclusion.\n\nReport No. 377 of the National Customs Office, Exhibit CE-35.\n\n237.\n\nOn this basis, it appears an inescapable conclusion on the basis of the record of evidence before the Tribunal that Paraguay has an outstanding debt to the Claimant under the Contract, and that it has, since 2005 at least, failed without proper justification to make payment on that debt. Putting it another way, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence demonstrates that the heart of the dispute that is before it concerns \"a persistent failure to make payment on an outstanding debt.\" Having carefully examined each and every act that is complained of by the Claimant - from Minister Zayas' letter of 14 June 1999 to Decree No.10485 adopted by the Ministry of the Interior on 22 June 2007 - the Tribunal concludes that each act is essentially about the failure to make the payment that is owed. A generous interpretation of the facts would conclude that before March 2005, each act could be said to concern the issue of assessing whether there was an outstanding debt on which payment was due. After the publication of the Report of March 2005 there was no need for any further assessment, as the validity of the debt had, in effect, been recognized by the relevant Paraguayan authorities, and a payment was recognized as being owed. From March 2005, there has been a straightforward refusal to pay, without any apparent justification.\n\n238.\n\nThe Tribunal therefore concludes that the conduct that lies at the heart of the dispute, and which has been repeated over time in particular since March 2005, is the refusal on the part of Paraguay to pay an outstanding debt that is owed under the Contract.\n\n4.3.3.2 The characterization of the conduct: non-performance of Contract or exercise of sovereign authority\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n239.\n\nThe Tribunal turns therefore next to the issue of how to characterize Paraguay's conduct. Is the persistent refusal to pay an outstanding debt under the Contract a sovereign act, as the Claimant argues, or merely an act that an ordinary contracting party could have engaged in, as Paraguay argues?\n\n240.\n\nIt is important to recognize that beyond the refusal to pay there are no other acts that the Claimant really seeks to remedy. Whilst Paraguay has not paid a contractual debt that it has recognized since March 2005 as being owed, the Claimant has not argued that it has interfered in any other way with the Claimant's rights under the Contract. There is no allegation that Paraguay has, for example, by legislation or other means, sought to take any steps to interfere with other rights under the Contract, or that it has sought to prevent or otherwise limit the Claimant's rights of access to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n. There is no claim of the taking of a right under the Contract or of the Contract's unlawful discontinuance. There is no claim of harassment or interference with the Claimant's right to be present in Paraguay, through its representatives, or to carry on such commercial activities as it wishes to engage in. It is impossible to escape the conclusion that this case is, in its totality and however valiantly the Claimant might otherwise seek to characterise it, about the non-payment of an outstanding debt under a Contract.\n\n241.\n\nIt is also apparent that Paraguay has not availed itself of the kinds of powers that are normally available to a sovereign if it wishes to interfere with the rights of an ordinary party. No legislation or regulatory acts have been adopted, no police powers used, no judgment of any court has been ignored. These are the kinds of powers that frequently characterise claims relating to unfair or inequitable treatment in international investment law. They typically require the exercise of powers that are simply not available to the ordinary contracting party. Yet no such act has been complained of in the present case. It is therefore not immediately apparent that any of the conduct complained of by the Claimant might not equally have been adopted by a contracting party which was not a sovereign: the initial refusal to pay, the commissioning of one internal report after another, the contradictory decisions of different departments, the involvement of the chief executive, and so on. There is nothing inherent in the fact that such conduct is undertaken by a State in its capacity as a contracting party that might as such endow them with the quality of sovereign acts such as to catalyse responsibility under an international treaty obligation relating to fair and equitable treatment. There has been no reliance by Paraguay on the powers of a public authority that might not - by analogous means - also be available to a private person or corporation. Attempts to mislead, distort, conceal or otherwise confuse a contractual partner are strategies open to and used by both public and private persons.\n\n242.\n\nIt is equally not apparent to the Tribunal that the mere passage of time can have the effect of transforming an act (or acts) that any private person could perform into a sovereign act. The Tribunal does not see how time alone, coupled with the repetition of the conduct, could as such transform the act of a sovereign contracting party into an exercise of sovereign authority. \"We will not pay\" means \"we will not pay\", whether it is said in Year 1 or in Year 8. The fact that eight years may have passed does not as such change the characterisation of the conduct. An act that breaches a contract remains that - and that alone - whether it has been done once in a single year or twenty times over eight years.\n\n243.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal is bound to note the manner in which the case was framed in the original Request for Arbitration submitted to ICSID on February 16, 2007. Part III of the Request is entitled \u2018The Facts Relevant to the Dispute', and it is in three sections. Section B is entitled \"Paraguay's Failure to Pay Amounts Due Under the Contract\", and it runs to eight paragraphs. The only acts alleged to give rise to the violation of the Treaty concern the alleged failure to make payments owing under the Contract. Paragraph 33 of the Request, for example, which addresses violations of the Treaty, states that \"The Ministry of Finance's conduct *in failing to pay amounts due to BIVAC under the Contract* [\u2026] is attributable to Paraguay and engages its state responsibility under international law and the Treaty\" (emphasis added). The Tribunal notes that no acts - either in relation to rights under the Contract or the availability of the contractually agreed forum for the resolution of disputes under the Contract - are complained of in the Request. It is true that the Claimant has reserved to itself, in the paragraph that follows, the right to supplement or amend its claims, and that over the course of the proceedings its case has indeed evolved and changed. This seems to have occurred in order to accommodate the views expressed by the Tribunal in its Decision on Jurisdiction. This is reflected, for example, in the Claimant's Reply on the Merits, where it's case has been recast to contradict the claim in the Request, stating that:\n\n\"BIVAC is not complaining here of its failure to recover its investment through payment of a contractual debt in January 1999. Rather, it is complaining about its loss of investment through Paraguay's conduct in the following decade - successive governments distancing themselves from an earlier obligation for their own463political interests, one after another -resulting in effective repudiation\".463\n\nBIVAC Reply on the Merits, para. 5.\n\n244.\n\nThe Claimant is of course entitled to seek to recast the facts in another light, and to present them in a different way. The Tribunal is not persuaded, however, that the Claimant got it wrong in its Request for Arbitration, or that the facts are in reality different from the way in which they were originally characterised by the Claimant. As explained in detail in its Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, the Tribunal holds that these facts cannot sustain a claim for a loss of investment due to Paraguay's conduct, since there was no allegation that the Contract was unlawfully interfered with except in relation to a payment that is said to be due under the Contract. The Contract was lawfully discontinued, and the Claimant's right to have recourse to the contractually agreed forum for the resolution of its claim has not been interfered with, whether by way of exercise of *puissance publique* or otherwise. The facts show that this dispute is indeed about Paraguay's \"failing to pay amounts due to BIVAC under the Contract\", as the Claimant put the matter in it's Application, no more and no less. The record cannot sustain a claim that the facts concern conduct that gave rise to a loss of investment. The investment came to an end, and it is not in dispute that it did so in accordance with the Contract and therefore lawfully.\n\n245.\n\nAccordingly, we now turn to the consequences of our conclusion that this dispute is, at its heart, only about the non-payment of a contractual debt. We are bound to inquire whether the breach of contract is \"the result of behaviour going beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could adopt\", and whether the actions of Paraguay are those not of a mere contracting party but those of a sovereign exercising public powers \u2018*puissance publique*'.\n\n246.\n\nThe Parties are divided on a great number of issues, but they appear to agree that for Paraguay to be liable for a violation of Article 3(1) it must be shown that it acted in a manner that is qualitatively different from an ordinary contracting party. In fact, by its very nature an act that breaches a contract is likely to contradict an initial representation of one of the parties to the contract, and the act may occur for undisclosed reasons or without transparency or pursuant to bad faith of the party in breach. This is the daily lot and misfortune of commercial life, giving rise to a great number of commercial proceedings in law. States are not exempt from this type of conduct. It can be part of the unfair or unreasonable treatment that may be meted out to a private partner in a contractual relationship. Such behaviour under a contract, however, cannot as such give rise to a violation of an obligation established by Treaty governed by international law. All the characterisations that have been invoked to characterize unfair and unreasonable treatment in international law and which the Claimant has argued and which the Respondent denies having occurred -arbitrariness, lack of transparency, negligence, inconsistency, bad faith, the frustration of legitimate expectations, the introduction of unreasonable measures - occur in exercise of sovereign authority over and above acts that constitute mere breach of contract. Something more than mere breach of contract is needed. This might occur, for example, if the State agreed to the jurisdiction of its national courts for the resolution of a contractual dispute and then acted to limit effective access to such courts.\n\n247.\n\nBearing these considerations in mind, both Parties have devoted considerable attention to the issue of whether the conduct of Paraguay that is the subject of this dispute is to be characterised as the exercise of sovereign authority (*puissance publique*), and as such the kind of acts that could give rise to Paraguay's liability for a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT. It is no surprise that they adopt markedly different approaches and conclusions.\n\n248.\n\nThe Claimant argues that the acts for which Paraguay is responsible amount to an exercise of sovereign authority. On its approach, the characterization of Paraguay's conduct is to be addressed principally by reference to the motivation of the acts that are the subject of the dispute. The Claimant argues that \"conduct surrounding the contract breach\" is to be treated as an exercise of sovereign authority where the conduct \"is politically motivated [\u2026] without the existence of any genuine good faith dispute under the underlying contract.\" On its approach, where the \"State's breach of contract is the consequence of the political convenience of the government in power then it ceases to be a mere contractual breach and constitutes a parallel breach of the FET standard.\"464 According to the Claimant,\n\n\"[t]he key distinction between a mere commercial breach of contract and a breach of FET does not depend on how actions or measures may be labeled. It depends on whether the parties to a State contract are engaged in a genuine difference of opinion in respect of the scope or interpretation of their respective contractual rights or a good-faith exercise (or breach) of such rights. If so, then that is a simple contractual dispute that should be resolved by the contractual dispute resolution mechanism. However, if the state is not engaged in such a good faith discussion and simply asserts political excuses for its failure to comply in an arbitrary manner then the dispute is a ripe FET claim. This distinction is at the essence of what has sometimes been called the exercise (or not) of \u2018puissance publique'.\"465\n\nBIVAC Post Hearing Brief, para. 10.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 92.\n\n249.\n\nOn the Claimant's assessment of the facts, Paraguay's act of \"non-payment of the debt obeys political reasons and is not based on any good faith contractual or commercial cause\", and is motivated by reasons of \"political convenience\", namely the desire not to take responsibility for obligations assumed by a previous government.466 According to the Claimant, the facts show \"that Paraguay did not fail to pay the debt to BIVAC due to the existence of any good faith contractual dispute\" and thus finds\n\n\"no reasonable foundation in private law rights, and cannot be labelled as commercial. It was motivated by governmental or political reasons which have nothing to do with the Contract itself.\"467\n\n*Ibid*., para. 11.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 102.\n\n250.\n\nIn support of the view that the motive for the conduct is the main factor to be taken into account in assessing whether conduct is to be treated as an exercise of sovereign authority, the Claimant relies principally on five decisions: *Alpha v. Ukraine* ; *Kardassopoulos v. Georgia* ; *Rumeli v. Kazakhstan* ; *PSEG v. Turkey* ; and *Eureko v.* *Poland*. It invokes other awards, including the decisions in *Bayindir v. Pakistan* ; *RFCC v. Morocco* ; *Impregilo v. Pakistan* ; and *Amto v. Ukraine*.\n\n251.\n\nFor its part, Paraguay adopts a different approach: it considers that the characterization of conduct as an exercise of sovereign authority turns not on the motivation of the act, but rather on its nature and distinguishing features. Paraguay invokes the decision of the Tribunal in *Bayindir v Pakistan*, to the effect that the distinction between a treaty breach and a contract violation requires a claimant to \"establish a breach different in nature from a simple contract violation, in other words one which the State commits in the exercise of its sovereign power.\"468 For the Respondent, the conduct must be of a nature that is such that a non-sovereign could not engage in it.\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 7, citing *Bayindir v. Pakistan*, para 180.\n\n252.\n\nFor Paraguay, motivation is not the pertinent factor. It argues that \"the alleged purpose of the contract and purported reasons for failing to pay are irrelevant to whether the acts that form the basis of BIVAC's claim. are acts beyond that of an ordinary contracting party.\"469 Rather, it submits that it is the nature of the act that is significant, and in support of that proposition it invokes authorities drawn from the area of sovereign immunity which, it argues, recognise that\n\n\"the alleged motive for the act is not dispositive; instead, it is the nature of the act that matters. If the act is of such a nature that it could have been done by a private party, it is not a sovereign act. Thus, whatever the purported reasons for refusing to pay under a contract and failing to comply with purported promises to pay, there has been no sovere47i0gn act because any private party could have engaged in the same conduct.\"470\n\nParaguay Post-Hearing Brief, para. 98.\n\n*Ibid*.\n\n253.\n\nIn support of its approach, Paraguay distinguishes the authorities relied upon by the Claimant and invokes a number of other authorities. It argues that all the cases relied upon by the Claimant in support of its view that motive is the defining factor in fact show that \"a sovereign act occurs when the State uses its police, adjudicatory, or legislative powers to the detriment of the rights of the claimant\"; according to Paraguay, in this case no such act has occurred.471 Paraguay further argues that the Claimant has not presented evidence to establish that Paraguay's failure to pay the contractual debt was politically motivated, and that no witness testified that Paraguay withheld payment out of political considerations and no documents prove that the government was so motivated. BIVAC merely relies on innuendo and supposition.472\n\n*Ibid.* para. 99.\n\n*Ibid.,* para. 97.\n\n254.\n\nThe Tribunal turns now to its own approach. It has paid very close attention to the arguments of the Parties. The characterization of conduct - does it amount to an exercise of sovereign authority or is it of the kind that an ordinary contracting party could engage in? - is necessarily a matter that turns on the facts of each particular case. This is evident from the numerous decisions invoked by both Parties in support of their respective arguments. The Tribunal considers that it is useful to carefully look at those authorities, and it has done so. But it is also conscious that this is a matter that largely turns on the appreciation of facts, and that it is not for the Tribunal to substitute its view of the facts of any of these authorities for those of the respective tribunal reaching the decision, given their proximity to the arguments raised by the parties, and to the evidence in the factual record. In examining these cases, the Tribunal has therefore sought to understand the approach of each tribunal in assessing the facts, with a view to understanding whether the decision reached focused on *the motive behind the conduct*, as the Claimant argues, or on *the nature of the conduct*, as Paraguay argues, or on a combination of these two elements. The Tribunal is bound to note, before embarking on this review, that in no case that was argued before it has an arbitral tribunal ruled that the non-payment of an outstanding contractual debt could -taken alone - be characterized as an exercise of sovereign authority such as to give rise to a violation of an obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment to an investor.\n\n255.\n\n*Kardassopolous and Fuchs v. Georgia* *473* In this case, on which the Claimant placed particular reliance, Georgia was found to be in violation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment in circumstances in which it began by expropriating the claimants' investment, and subsequently proceeded to establish a compensation commission to determine the amount of compensation to be paid for that act of expropriation. The tribunal ruled that Georgia had failed to provide procedural and substantive due process during the proceedings of the compensation commission, which was a substitute for the dispute settlement process which the claimants argued they were entitled to have access to but which they had not invoked. The Claimant relies on the award to argue that, like the claimants in that case, it had a legitimate expectation that Paraguay would \"implement [a] compensation process that was procedurally and substantively fair.\"474\n\n*Kardassopolous and Fuchs v Georgia*.\n\nBIVAC Post Hearing Brief, para. 80 citing *Kardassopolous and Fuchs v Georgia,* para. 441.\n\n256.\n\nThe Tribunal notes that the facts are distinguishable from the present case. The claimants were not parties to a contract, and the tribunal did not invoke the availability of any contractual remedies otherwise available to the entity in which they were investors. At the heart of that case was an act of expropriation, which by its very nature is conduct that only a State can engage in and which is, almost be definition, an example of the exercise of sovereign authority. Moreover, the act of establishing an adjudicatory *ad hoc* body to deliberate on and award compensation for the expropriation is necessarily an act that only a sovereign entity can engage in: the act of expropriation and consequential actions are not the acts of an entity acting as a contracting party.\n\n257.\n\nThe *Kardassopolous* tribunal devotes twenty-four paragraphs to its assessment of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, and its conclusion that Georgia violated its obligation to provide such treatment.475 A careful reading of those paragraphs makes clear that the tribunal's conclusion was based on the tribunal's finding that, following the act of expropriation, Georgia made \"specific assurances of compensation\", which assurances \"gave rise to a specific expectation of compensation\" against the background of \"the legitimate expectation that Georgia would conduct itself vis-\u00e0-vis his investment in a manner that was reasonably justifiable and did not manifestly violate basic requirements of consistency, transparency, even-handedness and non-discrimination\".476 In the end no compensation was forthcoming.\n\n*Kardassopolous and Fuchs v Georgia,* paras. 428-452.\n\n*Ibid.,* paras. 439, 441\n\n258.\n\nThe facts in the present case are plainly distinguishable. In the present case there was no act of expropriation and no assurances were given by Paraguay that were equivalent to those offered by Georgia. The tribunal in *Kardassopolous* does not in terms address the issue of *puissance publique*, and whether its existence (or not) is to be determined by reference to the nature of the conduct or its motivation. However, it is evident from a close reading of the award that it was the nature of Georgia's actions - the acts of expropriation, establishment of a compensation commission and offering of assurances that compensation would be forthcoming - that underpinned the ruling that Georgia had violated the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. Having identified the nature of the acts, only then did the tribunal turn to the issue of the arbitrariness of Georgia's conduct. The tribunal did not seek to justify its finding by reference to the motive of the actions.\n\n259.\n\n*Rumeli v. Kazakhstan* *477* In the *Rumeli* case the tribunal concluded that there had been a violation of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment in circumstances where Kazakhstan terminated an investment contract to which it was a party before its expiration date, without previously suspending the contract as its terms required. According to the tribunal, such conduct amounted to a breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment (which was incorporated by means of a most-favoured nation clause) because it was \"arbitrary, unfair, unjust, lacked in due process and did not respect the investor's reasonable and legitimate expectations.\"478 The arbitral tribunal further ruled that the subsequent process that led to the decision of a working group created to assess the termination of the contract \"lacked transparency and due process and was unfair, in contradiction with the requirements of the fair and equitable treatment principle\", and that \"since the Working Group acted as an organ of the State, the violation amounts to a breach of the BIT by the Republic of Kazakhstan.\"479\n\n*Rumeli Telekom v. Kazakhstan*.\n\nIbid., para. 615.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 618.\n\n260.\n\nIt cannot be said that this aspect of the award is overly burdened by the weight of its reasoning. The tribunal does not indicate whether it is the nature of the conduct - the termination of the investment contract coupled with the creation and operation of the working group \"as an organ of the State\" - or its motivation that caused it to reach the conclusion that it did. The Tribunal does not see, therefore, that either Party in the present case can obtain much assistance from this somewhat *de minimis* award. From the published award, however, it does appear that the Respondent made no arguments as regards *puissance publique* or the characterization of Kazakhstan's conduct in relation to its contractual obligations. It is also apparent that the claimants had no contract with Kazakhstan, and accordingly the state owed no contractual obligation to the claimants, and no contractually agreed forum was therefore available to the claimants to pursue any claim. The tribunal did not identify or engage with the issues that arise in the present case, which appears also to be distinguishable in the sense that the *Rumeli* case went beyond a mere failure to pay an outstanding debt under a contract in circumstances in which a remedy for violations of the contract remained available.\n\n261.\n\n*PSEG v. Turkey* *480* In *PSEG* the tribunal ruled that Turkey had violated its obligations to provide fair and equitable treatment as a result of a series of actions of the State that were serious enough to give rise to liability. The tribunal found that Turkey had demonstrated \"evident negligence [...] in the handling of the negotiations with the Claimants\", had engaged in \"abuse of authority\" in seeking to renegotiate the contract that governed the relations between the parties in a manner that went \"far beyond\" the purpose of the applicable law and the relevant public body's \"authority\", \"ignore[d] rights granted by law as a matter of policy or practice\", ignored a decision of the Turkish Constitutional Court \"upholding the rights acquired under a contract\", and engaged in constant changes in legislation that had a \"\u2018roller-coaster' effect of [\u2026] continuing legislative changes.\"481\n\n*PSEG v. Turkey*.\n\n*Ibid*., paras 246-250.\n\n262.\n\nIt is apparent from the award - which followed a decision on jurisdiction in which the tribunal had already concluded that \"[t]he nature of the dispute is [\u2026] not that of a typical contractual dispute\"482 - that the tribunal was addressing conduct that no ordinary contractual party could engage in, and that in any event went far beyond the mere failure to pay an outstanding debt under a contract. The case is therefore plainly distinguishable from the present case, since the conduct of Turkey as a commercial partner, rather than a sovereign regulator, was not the basis of the tribunal's conclusions.\n\n*PSEG v. Turkey*, Decision on Jurisdiction, para. 173.\n\n263.\n\n*Alpha v. Ukraine* *483* In this case, the arbitral tribunal found that Ukraine had interfered with a contractual relationship between claimant and a third party, in a manner that effectively negated agreements under the contract and directly interfered with the day-to-day management of the company in which the claimant had invested.484 In circumstances in which the Ukraine was not a party to the contract, the question of whether the State was acting in exercise of sovereign authority or as a contracting party did not arise. For this reason the award is of no relevance to the issue we face.\n\n*Alpha v. Ukraine*,.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 422.\n\n264.\n\n*Eureko v Poland* *485* In the Eureko case the Council of Ministers of Poland adopted a Resolution on 2 April 2002 which prevented Eureko, the claimant in that case, from acquiring from the State Treasury an additional 21% of the shares in the entity in which it had invested, thereby preventing it form acquiring the controlling interest in the newly privatized company (PZU) that it had expected to gain. By a majority, the tribunal interpreted this act, and others that followed as a consequence, as evidence that Poland had \"consciously and knowingly, decided to violate the investment of Eureko in PZU by refusing to honour its legal commitments\", and these acts \"frustrated the investment of Eureko in PZU\" (including Poland's commitment to allow it to obtain a controlling stake in PZU) and violated its rights as a shareholder.486\n\n*Eureko v Poland*.\n\n*Ibid*., paras. 201, 219, 224, 226.\n\n265.\n\nIt is evident that the majority in the *Eureko* case founded its decision on the resolution adopted by Poland's Council of Ministers, which is self evidently a sovereign act going beyond what a party to a contract might engage in. By that resolution Poland's Council of Ministers \"resolved that it was essential for the state Treasury to maintain control over [PZU] and [...] consented to a change in the privatization strategy for [PZU].\"487 The resolution also \"obligated the State Treasurer to advise ambassadors of EU member states of a change in the privatization strategy.\"488 These are self-evidently actions that are not of a nature that can be adopted by an ordinary contracting party. The Tribunal notes that in the present case the conduct that is complained of is qualitatively different.\n\n*Ibid*., para. 218.\n\n*Ibid.*\n\n266.\n\n*Other cases* Numerous other cases have also been cited, by one or other Party. In *Bayindir v. Pakistan*, for example, the tribunal found that there was no breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, and found *inter alia* that a failure to make payments under the contract at issue in this dispute could be characterized as being based on \"a reasonable contractual explanation.\"489 This is a point on which the Claimant relies. The Tribunal notes, however, that there is nothing in the award to indicate that the mere failure to pay an amount owing under a contract could, as such and taken alone, gives rise to an obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. The same point may be made in relation to *RFCC v. Morocco490* and *Noble Ventures v. Romania.491* Another case referred to is *AMTO v Ukraine*,492 which was not a dispute between the claimant and the State under the contract, but alleged conduct on the part of the Ukraine that was said to have caused the entity in which the claimant had invested to be unable to recover certain debts. On the basis of the evidence the tribunal rejected the claim, but this Tribunal notes in any event there is nothing in the award to support the proposition that the mere failure of a State that is a party to a contract to pay an outstanding debt on the contract could, of itself, amount to a breach of a treaty obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.\n\n*Bayindir v. Pakistan*, para. 356.\n\n*RFCC v. Morocco.*\n\n*Noble Ventures v. Romania.*\n\n*Limited Liability Company AMTO v. Ukraine*, (SCC Arbitration No. 080/2005, Award, 26 March 2008 [hereinafter, *AMTO* *v. Ukraine* ].\n\n267.\n\nFrom this review of the case law it is apparent that, in determining whether conduct of a State violates an obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, arbitral tribunals do not necessarily adopt a uniform or completely consistent approach, and only rarely engage in an explicit consideration of whether the conduct in question constitutes an exercise of sovereign authority. Indeed, that issue inevitably arises only when the State is itself a party to a contract and the relationship between an alleged breach of a contract and/or treaty is in issue, and it is necessary to determine whether the conduct goes beyond that of a contracting party, in the sense identified by the tribunal in the *Impregilo* case.\n\n268.\n\nAcross the range of cases, it is apparent also that in assessing conduct arbitral tribunals consider both the nature of the act and its motivation. To the extent that any sort of general approach can be discerned, it seems that tribunals adopt a two step process, whether explicitly or implicitly: *first* they address the nature of conduct; *second*, assuming the conduct to be such as to give rise to the possibility of a breach of the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment, they address whether it meets the requirement not to be arbitrary or discriminatory or otherwise unfair or inequitable. That second element necessarily requires an assessment of motive, but it is plain that the motive that explains particular conduct is treated as being distinct from, and informing of, its nature.\n\n269.\n\nIn the present case the real issue the Tribunal is faced with is the determination of whether a refusal to pay an outstanding contractual debt can by its nature constitute a sovereign act, in the sense of being conduct that an ordinary contracting party cannot engage in. The Tribunal notes that the Claimant has not been able to identify a single case in which a tribunal has ruled that the non-payment of an outstanding debt by a State (or statal body) could be characterised as an exercise of sovereign authority. This is true too even if the non-payment is said to be persistent and unjustified under the contract. In cases in which a violation of a contractual obligation has formed the basis of a finding that the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment has been violated, the conduct in relation to the contract has been accompanied by some other act or conduct that the respective tribunal has determined to be an exercise of sovereign authority: the act of expropriation in the *Kardassopolous* case is an example.\n\n270.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes therefore that it is necessary to look at the nature of the conduct in question. In the present case, the failure to pay the outstanding debt was an act of Paraguay dating back to at least 1999. At that moment, the conduct was the simple failure to pay the debt: to carry out an assessment of whether the debt was due, and if so to instruct the relevant body to authorize a payment on the amount and then to pay the amount. That conduct continued until 2005, when the debt was acknowledged. Throughout that period, the conduct in question concerned the failure to pay the debt under the contract. Thereafter, the acknowledgment of the debt by the State - or elements of it - cannot transform the nature of the conduct, which remains a continuing failure to pay the debt and no more. If that acknowledgement had been accompanied by other acts of Paraguay that interfered with the Claimant's ability to recover the debt - for example by an exercise of sovereign authority interfering with the availability of the contractually agreed forum for the resolution of disputes concerning the amount owing under the Contract - the situation may be different. But there were no such acts. The Tribunal notes too that the Claimant has not been able to cite any authority for the proposition that international law imposes any obligation as such on a State to pay moneys owing under a contract.\n\n271.\n\nAgainst the Claimant's argument, there are other authorities that support the conclusion that the non-payment of a contractual debt cannot as such be characterised as an exercise of sovereign authority such as to give rise to a liability for a failure to meet the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment.\n\n272.\n\nIn *Waste Management v. Mexico* the arbitral tribunal in a case under the North American Free Trade Agreement had to decide whether Mexico had violated the claimant's right to fair an equitable treatment under Article 1105 NAFT. The tribunal ruled:\n\n\"For present purposes it is sufficient to say that even the persistent nonpayment of debts by a municipality is not to be equated with a violation of Article 1105, provided that it does not amount to an outright and unjustified repudiation of the transaction and provided that some remedy is open to the creditor to address the problem.\"493\n\n*Waste Management v. Mexico,* para. 115.\n\n273.\n\nIn the Tribunal's view that conclusion applies equally to the consideration of Article 3(1) of the BIT in the present case. The reason is that such conduct does not go beyond that in which an ordinary contracting party could engage. Such conduct coupled with repudiation of the transaction, or interference with other rights under the transaction, including the right of access to the contractual remedy, would tend to transform the conduct beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could engage in. No such additional conduct exists in the present case, and it has not been argued - and cannot reasonably be argued - that there has been a repudiation of the Contract.\n\n274.\n\nThe second pertinent case is *Parkerings v. Lithuania*, where the tribunal was faced with the issue of the relationship between a breach of a contract and the obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. The tribunal ruled that\n\n\"[u]nder certain limited circumstances, a substantial breach of a contract could constitute a violation of a treaty. So far, case law has offered very few illustrations of such a situation. In most cases, a preliminary determination by a competent court as to whether the contract was breached under municipal law is necessary. This preliminary determination is even more necessary if the parties to the contract have agreed on a specific forum for all disputes arising out of the contract.\n\n[\u2026]\n\nHowever, if the contracting-party is denied access to domestic courts, and thus denied opportunity to obtain redress of the injury and to complain about those contractual breaches, then an arbitral tribunal is in position, on the basis of the BIT, to decide whether this lack of remedies had consequences on the investment and thus whether a violation of international law occurred. In other words, as a general rule, a tribunal whose jurisdiction is based solely on a BIT will decide over the \"treatment\" that the alleged breach of contract has received in the domestic context, rather than over the existence of a breach as such.\"494\n\n*Parkerings v. Lithuania,* para. 316 - 317.\n\n275.\n\nThis Tribunal too does not exclude the possibility that there may be circumstances in which a substantial breach of a contract could, as such, give rise a breach of an obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment. To make such a case a claimant would have to point to a requirement of international law imposing an obligation to comply with a contract and persuade a tribunal that such a requirement was part of the obligation to provide such treatment. The fact that no authority has been brought to the Tribunal's attention and which identifies an example of such a situation indicates that it will be rare, assuming that it could ever arise. Even if it did arise, the continued unhindered availability of a contractually agreed forum for the resolution of the dispute under the contract would be a significant factor imposing an additional hurdle for a claimant to overcome were it to make such an argument.\n\n276.\n\nHaving concluded that this dispute is premised on Paraguay's failure to make a payment of a debt owing under the Contract it entered into with the Claimant, the Tribunal further concludes that Paraguay's failure to pay that outstanding debt, including in particular in the period after March 2005, cannot properly be characterized as an exercise of sovereign authority. It is, in the Tribunal's view, conduct that an ordinary private party to a contract might also engage in. The fact that the failure is persistent cannot change the character of the conduct. Nor can the fact that the failure appears to be wholly unjustified transform the nature of the conduct into the exercise of sovereign authority. Taking the Claimant's case at its highest, the bottom line is that Paraguay has refused to pay sums owing to the Claimant under the Contract. That failure, which turns on the facts established in the record, cannot as a matter of law amount to an exercise of sovereign authority. In the Tribunal's view the facts show \"mere breach by a State of a contract with an alien (whose proper law is not international law)\" and that accordingly no violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT arises.495 As the *Impregilo* Tribunal put the point in respect of one aspect of the case before it:\n\n\"These are matters that concern the implementation of the Contracts, and do not involve any issue beyond the application of a contract, and the conduct of contracting parties. In particular, the matter does not concern any exercise of \"*puissance publique\"* by the State.\"496\n\nSee S. Schwebel, \"On Whether the Breach by a State of a Contract with an Alien is a Breach of International Law,\" in *Justice in International Law*, 425, 431 (1994).\n\n*Impregilo v. Pakistan* para. 268. (see also paragraph 278, where the Tribunal notes that \"a Host State acting as a contracting party does not \"interfere\" with a contract; it \"performs\" it. If it performs the contract badly, this will not result in a breach of the provisions of the Treaty relating to expropriation or nationalisation, unless it be proved that the State or its emanation has gone beyond its role as a mere party to the contract, and has exercised the specific functions of a sovereign authority.\")\n\n277.\n\nIt follows from this that the Respondent's failure to pay its debt may be one of the prerequisites for determining that a State might be liable for a breach of an obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment but that the other essential prerequisite for such violation, i.e. the exercise of sovereign power, has not been satisfied. Putting this conclusion another way, the Tribunal finds that the case is a contractual dispute, no more and no less. A forum for the resolution of contractual disputes has been agreed by the Parties to the Contract. The right to have access to that forum - the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n - remains fully available, and has not been interfered with by Paraguay in exercise of sovereign authority (or otherwise). There is nothing in the record of evidence to indicate that the Claimant was somehow induced - whether by representations or other means made by or on behalf of Paraguay - not to bring proceedings before the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n. The Claimant has chosen not to avail itself of its rights under the Contract to have access to that forum. When asked during the hearing why it had taken that decision, counsel on its behalf characterised the choice as \"a commercial decision.\"497\n\nTranscript of Hearing on the Merits (July 5 -7, 2011), page 91/18\n\n278.\n\nThe Claimant raises arguments concerning the lack of independence and the general inadequacy of the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n as a forum for the resolution of the contractual dispute. The Tribunal notes that the Request for Arbitration made no such claim when it was submitted in 2007. It was only by the Claimant's Memorial dated 27 November 2009 and at the hearing that any evidence was tendered in relation to the matter, and that related to allegations of lack of judicial independence long after the dispute had arisen, and many years after the Claimant could have brought its case to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n.\n\n279.\n\nIn addressing this matter, the Tribunal has asked itself whether there are any aspects of Paraguay's conduct in failing to pay outstanding debts under the Contract that could not be fully remedied in proceedings before the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n. At this point in time, it sees none. As noted above, in its Request for Arbitration the Claimant itself characterised its claim as being to recover payment of a debt owing under a contract. It did not request this Tribunal to provide any other relief, and it did not assert that Paraguay had otherwise interfered with its contractual rights, for example by interfering with the availability of the contractually agreed forum for disputes relating to the Contract. The Tribunal recognizes, however, that the Claimant's allegations that \"the lack of independence of the Paraguayan courts is notorious\",498 and that the court system is corrupt, slow and cost-intensive, are serious allegations. A cornerstone for the distinction of the non-payment of a contractual debt as being *either* a breach of contract *or* - in addition - a violation of a treaty obligation is the question of whether the State acted in the exercise of its sovereign power. One of the expressions of such power would be an intereference with the functioning of the agreed dispute resolution mechanism before national courts, or the failure to ensure that such courts function in a manner that is independent and effective, and gives rulings solely on the basis of law. A deviation from generally accepted principles in the functioning of the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n would be relevant to the assessment of an alleged violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.\n\nBIVAC Memorial, para 153.\n\n280.\n\nOn the basis of the foregoing, the Tribunal concludes that, at this point in time, Paraguay has not, by its failure to make payment on the outstanding debt under the Contract, violated Article 3(1) of the BIT. It notes that a lack of effectiveness of the agreed contractual dispute resolution mechanism might give rise to a different conclusion\n\n281.\n\nHaving so concluded, the Tribunal proceeds to consider the consequences of this Decision.\n\n4.3.3.3 Recourse to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\n282.\n\nAs set out above, it has been a central part of the Tribunal's consideration that the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n were available to the Claimant from the moment the dispute arose until the date on which the Request for arbitration was filed. As noted at paragraphs 38 to 41 of this Decision, the Tribunal invited the Parties to express views as to whether the Claimant's contractual claims were now time barred according to Paraguayan law. In their responses, both Parties agreed that the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n continue to be available to the Claimant in respect of its claims under the Contract, on the grounds that any period of limitation that might have been applicable was interrupted before it had ended. It follows from this that, if it wishes to do so, the Claimant can still ave recourse to those tribunals to pursue its contractual claim.\n\n283.\n\nUntil now, the Claimant has apparently not wished to avail itself of its right under the Contract to have recourse to the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n. It may now wish to do so, and the Tribunal considers it appropriate to have a limited period within which to avail itself of this right.\n\n284.\n\nThe Tribunal will therefore stay these proceedings for a limited period of three months, within which the Claimant may wish to exercise its right to have recourse to the Asunci\u00f3n tribunals. If the Claimant does not avail itself of this possibility, the Tribunal will thereafter render its Award and terminate these proceedings. In the event that the Claimant does avail itself of the possibility, the Tribunal will retain jurisdiction over these proceedings for a reasonable period of time, to allow the tribunals of Asunci\u00f3n to hear the Claimant's claim. The Tribunal considers that it will be appopriate for the Claimant to inform the Tribunal at the latest three months after the date of this Decisionwhether it has chosen to pursue its claim before the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n. In the event it does pursue such a claim, the Parties are directed to report to the Tribunal, separately or jointly, on the status of those proceedings at intervals of six months. The first report will be due six months after the date of this Decision.\n\n285.\n\nIn this regard, the Tribunal is bound to note that on the basis of the arguments presented in these proceedings, the claim for payment under the Contract would appear to be straightforward and should not admit of any undue delay in its adjudication by the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n. In the event that such a claim is made, the Tribunal expects that Paraguay will not introduce any new factual elements in defending its claim or invoke the statute of limitation which it assures has not lapsed. The Tribunal further expects that Paraguay will not avail itself of any procedures that are aimed at introducing any inappropriate delays or other obstacles to the timely and efficient exercise of jurisdiction by the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n in dealing fairly with the claims for outstanding payments under the Contract. In the event that Paraguay or any of its organs, including the courts, fail to address any such claim in accordance with the requirements of Article 3(1) of the Treaty, the Claimant will be free to make an application to this Tribunal.\n\n286.\n\nThe Tribunal would be surprised if the resolution of the outstanding contractual dispute should provide any degree of difficulty before the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n. The issues of contractual breach have been very fully argued before this Tribunal. As noted above, the Customs Office has concluded, without ambiguity, that the Claimant performed its obligations and that it was, in effect, entitled to be paid what it is owed under the Contract, and both Parties agree that the claim is not time barred\n\n**5. Article 3(4) of the Treaty**\n---------------------------------\n\n287.\n\nIn its first Decision on Objections to Jurisdiction, in relation to the claim made under Article 3(4) of the Treaty the Tribunal joined to the merits the issue of whether the consequence of the decision on inadmissibility is that the claim should be dismissed or the exercise of jurisdiction stayed and had invited the Parties to submit its arguments with respect to the consequences of the inadmissibility of the claim.\n\n288.\n\nThe Claimant asserts that the Tribunal has the power to order a stay of the proceedings and that it would be appropriate to deal with admissibility issues. It argues that since the issue is not absolute and only a temporary obstacle, BIVAC should be granted the opportunity to initiate local proceedings under the contractual dispute settlement mechanism with the Tribunal exercising an ongoing \"supervisory function\":\n\n\"[T]here would be little point in dismissing jurisdiction here if, should BIVAC attempt to overcome the admissibility obstacle by resorting to local remedies, it became obvious very quickly that those remedies are blocked, ineffective or futile, or if Paraguay acts unfairly and uncooperatively in those proceedings. That is, the admissibility issue identified by the Tribunal could well fade away fairly quickly. If in the meantime the claim is dismissed as inadmissible, BIVAC would have to restart the process that it commenced almost three years ago.\"499\n\nBIVAC Memorial on the Merits, para 278 citing C. Schreuer *, Consent to arbitration*, in The Oxford handbook of International Investment Law, ed. Muchlinskiortino, Scheuer (Oxford University Press, 2008) p. 846, Exhibit CL - 115.\n\n289.\n\nThe Respondent argues that a stay \"would serve no real purpose in light of the Tribunal's prior holding as to that claim's inadmissibility\" and that it would only confuse the specificities of contractual claims and treaty claims. It therefore pleads for the dismissal of this part of the case.500\n\nParaguay Memorial on the Merits, para 149.\n\n290.\n\nThe Tribunal considers that a continued stay of the proceedings is the appropriate way forward, being a cost-effective and efficient in the treatment of the issue of admissibility. The Parties agree that the contractual dispute solution mechanism is still available. It is premature to say whether it will be employed by Claimant and- in the event that it is - whether it will meet expectations with regard to the sound administration of justice The Claimant will inform the Tribunal at the latest three months after the date of this Decision whether it has chosen to pursue its claim before the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n or not. In case it has, and the Paraguayan courts have ascertained Claimant's claim and the Respondent disregarded the decision, the claim under the umbrella clause might then become admissible, depending on the circumstances. For these reasons and in view of the decision taken in relation to Article 3(1), the Tribunal orders the stay of the proceedings with respect to the claim under Article 3(4) of the BIT.\n\n**6. Other matters**\n--------------------\n\n291.\n\nThe Tribunal is conscious that it might be said that it should have proceeded to give the relief sought by the Claimant, on the grounds that the Claimant has waited long enough to be paid on the debt it is owed. That is not a course the Tribunal was entitled to follow. In entering into the Contract, the Claimant agreed by its Article 9(1) that \"any conflict, controversy or claim which arises from or is produced in relation to this Contract, non compliance, resolution or invalidity shall be submitted to the Tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n pursuant to Paraguayan Law.\" The decision not to avail itself of rights under Article 9(1) was taken by the Claimant and by it alone, without any inducement, and on its own account for \"commercial reasons.\" In that respect, such delays as have arisen are therefore the responsibility of the Claimant alone.\n\n292.\n\nThe function of an arbitral tribunal established under the BIT, like any arbitral tribunal established in relation to ICSID and other investment treaty proceedings, is to apply the law in relation to the matters agreed by the States that adopted the BIT, in this case the Netherlands and Paraguay. It is not the function of arbitrators who are charged with interpreting and applying a treaty to go beyond the limits of what that treaty allows them to do, whether to do justice or for any other reasons. In its Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunal explained why this BIT did not provide remedies for mere breaches of contractual obligation, in circumstances where the parties to the contract had agreed on a specific forum to resolve contractual disputes. For this Tribunal to exercise jurisdiction in relation to a pure contractual dispute, in the circumstances of this case, would plainly amount to an excess of jurisdiction. The Netherlands and Paraguay did not agree to allow for the establishment of an arbitral tribunal as a forum for the mere collection of contractual debts except as specified by the BIT. The jurisdiction of this Tribunal is a limited and exceptional jurisdiction, one that is not permitted to stray beyond the matters agreed by the Netherlands and Paraguay.\n\n**7. Costs**\n------------\n\n293.\n\nThe Tribunal reserves jurisdiction to determine in the Award the costs of the Arbitration and their allocation between the Parties.\n\n**DECISION**\n------------\n\n294.\n\nFor these reasons the Tribunal decides that:\n\na. BIVAC has standing to bring the claims under Article 3(1) and 3(4) of the BIT;\n\nb. the exercise of jurisdiction in relation to the claims made under Articles 3(1) and 3(4) of the BIT is stayed;\n\nc. the termination of these proceedings is stayed for a period of three months from the date of this Decision, within which period the Claimant may wish to file before the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n a claim for breach of the Contract in order to recover the sums owing to it under the Contract and notify the Tribunal of its course of action, within that period;\n\nd. in the event that such a claim is not filed, the Tribunal shall render its Award and terminate these proceedings;\n\ne. in the event that such a claim is filed: (i) these proceedings will be stayed further and the Parties shall be directed to inform the Tribunal, either jointly or separately, every six months, beginning with the date of this Decision, on the status of the proceedings before the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n; (ii) the Claimant shall be free to make a further application in the event that the tribunals of the City of Asunci\u00f3n fail to proceed to the adjudication of any such a claim in a timely manner and in accordance with the requirements of the Treaty; and\n\nf. all other questions, including those concerning a potential obligation to pay interest, the costs and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the parties are reserved for future determination."}]}
